Shedding Light on the Dark Corners of the Internet: A Survey of Tor Research
TorSecurityAnonymitySurveyAnalysisDeanonymizationBreachingPath selectionPerformance analysis
Anonymity services have seen high growth rates with increased usage in the past few years. Among various services, Tor is one of the most popular peer-to-peer anonymizing service. In this survey paper, we summarize, analyze, classify and quantify 26 years of research on the Tor network. Our research shows that 'security' and 'anonymity' are the most frequent keywords associated with Tor research studies. Quantitative analysis shows that the majority of research studies on Tor focus on 'deanonymization' the design of a breaching strategy. The second most frequent topic is analysis of path selection algorithms to select more resilient paths. Analysis shows that the majority of experimental studies derived their results by deploying private testbeds while others performed simulations by developing custom simulators. No consistent parameters have been used for Tor performance analysis. The majority of authors performed throughput and latency analysis.

## Introduction

The Internet has revolutionized the world by transforming it into a global entity. Widespread advantages of Internet have spawned new industries and services. However, this connectivity comes at the cost of privacy. Every Internet client has a unique identity in the form of an Internet protocol (IP) address which can be translated to its location by the local Internet service provider (ISP). This lack of privacy has serious implications, particularly for journalists, freedom fighters and ordinary citizens.

Lack of privacy has lead to the use of anonymous communication networks (ACN). ACNs hide client IP addresses through various techniques. There are a number of ACNs including Tor, Java anonymous proxy (JAP), Hotspot Shield and UltraSurf etc. Among various ACNs, Tor is the one of the most popular network, owing to its distributed nature which makes it difficult to connect the two end points of a session. Recently, Tor has been used for bomb hoax at Harvard [1]. Similarly, it has been used by the Russians to bypass online censorship [2]. A number of attempts are being made by FBI and other organizations to breach Tor network [3][4] [5].

In this paper, we survey various studies conducted on the Tor network covering the scope of these studies. We quantify the studies into three broad but distinct groups, including (1) deanonymization, (2) path selection, (3) analysis and performance improvements, and several sub-categories. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the most comprehensive attempt at analyzing Tor network research with a focus over its anonymity mechanism. Table 1 presents a comparison of this survey with previous surveys covering the scope of researches and implementation (experiments), verification (simulations) and analysis of various research works. Categorization of first column is made by listing all Tor areas considered in our study. AlSabah and Goldberg [6] presented the most comprehensive study covering complete Tor network and our paper is complementary to their survey paper. However, our paper pays more focus to the anonymity and breaching aspects of Tor than their paper. Their research paper presents only twenty references related to anonymity while we present more than 120 1 references.

Analysis of keywords used in various studies shows that anonymity, security and privacy have been used the most. Our study shows that majority of the research works have been made in the field of "deanonymization" track, followed by "performance analysis and architectural improvements". In the deanonymization track, a major chunk of research is devoted to breaching attacks followed by traffic analysis. In the path selection track, most research works focused on the development of new algorithms. Relays, protocol messages and traffic interception have been the most frequently exploited factors in the Tor's deanonymization track. In the path selection track, performance and anonymity have been the most commonly used factors. Performance, relay selection and anonymity have been the most studied parameters in the performance analysis and improvement track. Analysis over simulations and experiments shows that 60% of studies used experiments and 86% of those experiments were carried out on private testbed networks. Among simulations, 75% of the studies developed their own simulator to analyze Tor network. Analysis of simulation parameters shows that there is no distinct pattern of parameters. However, majority of the studies used bandwidth and latency. Table 2 presents a glossary of the important abbreviations used in our survey paper. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the architecture of Tor network and its comparison with other anonymity services. Section 3 presents the studies covering deanonymization, path selection, and performance analysis and architectural improvements. Section 4 presents the simulations and experiments conducted in previous studies. Section 5 presents the Tor performance metrics, our findings and open research areas in Tor. Finally, section 6 concludes the paper.


## Anonymity tools

In this section, we present and discuss Tor and other anonymity tools. In the first part, we present the architecture of Tor network before presenting details of the research in Tor. In the second part, we present the comparison and working mechanism of other anonymity tools which compete with Tor.


### Architecture of Tor network

Tor network is composed of a decentralized distributed network of relays operated by volunteer users [13]. In July 2016, nearly 10, 000 users (per day) participated in the Tor network (as Tor relays and Tor bridges) to provide anonymity services to nearly half a million users daily [14]. History of Tor dates back to late 1990's when Goldschlag, Reed and Syverson presented the architecture and implemented onion routing in several papers [15,16,17,18] which laid the foundation of Tor network by providing proxy servers which are resilient to eavesdropping and effectively hide client's IP address. The Tor network consists of routers which cooperate with each other to provide low latency anonymity services to users. Central servers help Tor establish and update links between Tor routers. User participation as Tor relays (router) is optional, but it is recommended because it improves the chances of staying anonymous, because it increases the traffic to the user.

Tor's architecture has three types of components, namely onion proxy (OP), onion router (OR) and directory server (DS). OPs are used by Tor users to obtain up-to-date information of operating relays from DS. OPs also creates connections using the information from a DS. Users may configure OPs to select specific routers.

ORs are Tor relay routers, operated by volunteer users, to act as entry (guard), middle and exit relays. Information of all online relays is available at DS. To counter attacks on Tor that block Tor relays, a secret group of Tor relays exists with the DS, called bridges. A set of three bridge relays is available through unique Gmail addresses. Once a connection is established, every OR knows only immediate predecessor and successor node. Nine authorities acting as Tor DSs keep an up-to-date record of all available ORs and broadcast the bandwidth, IP, public key, exit policies etc. to OPs. Figure 1 shows a circuit established from a user to a server through three Tor relays. The various steps involved in circuit establishment are listed below:

1. OP sends HTTP requests to DS for information about Tor relays. 2. OP selects three Tor routers (entry relay, intermediate relay and exit relay) using Tor's path selection algorithm considering maximum anonymity and performance. 3. OP sends a Create Cell request (containing half of Diffie-Hellman handshake [19]) to the entry node. The entry node replies with the hash of the negotiated key. 4. Next, OP sends a Extend Cell request to the entry node containing the address of the intermediate relay and encryption key. Entry node forwards the cell to the intermediate node. Similar to previous case, the intermediate node replies with Created cell response. Similar process continues till client negotiates the key with the exit relay. 5. OP constructs IP packet P 1 with source and destination IP addresses of exit relay and destination server, respectively, and packet size of 512 bytes. 6. OP encrypts the packet further with the key E3, negotiated between client and exit relay, and containing source and destination addresses of intermediate relay and exit relay. 7. Next, OP encrypts with the key E2, negotiated between client and intermediate relay, and containing source and destination IPs of entry relay and intermediate relay. 8. Finally, OP constructs packet P 2 encrypted with key E1, negotiated between client and entry relay, and containing source and destination IPs of OP and entry relay. 9. Packet P 2 is transmitted from the entry relay, which decrypts the packet and forwards it to intermediate relay. All relays decrypt the packet using their specialized decryption keys and forward it towards the destination.

Cell refers to the Tor Packet, comprising of payload data and headers, with an aggregate size of 512 bytes [20,21,22]. Padding is used to fill cells with less data.

Tor relays communicate with each other by pairwise TCP connections. Traffic multiplexing is used to transfer data between any pair of relays. Tor employs token buckets to rate limit connections. Buckets are filled and removed with tokens based on configured bandwidth limits and data read, respectively. TCP buffers are read using a round-robin scheduling mechanism. For flow control, edges (client and exit node) keep track of data flow by maintaining an active window about the packets in flight. Data packets are processed in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner from the queues of Tor relays. Multiplexing of packets, from Tor relays to relay links, is performed using exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) scheduler.


### Comparison with other anonymization services

In this section, we present the features and working mechanisms of other deanonymization services which compete with Tor network. Table 3 presents a comparison of Tor with other deanonymization services. Table 3 shows that Tor is the only anonymity service which provides various services (http, https, visible TCP port, remote DNS, hides IP and user-to-proxy encryption) under all circumstances. On the contrary, JonDo, I2P, CGI and socks5 provide some services in limited circumstances only. A summary of various anonymity services is presented in following subsections.


#### Cross Platform Anonymity Tools

A number of cross platforms anonymity tools are used now-a-days. In below lines, we summarize the basic working mechanism of prominent anonymity tools.

• Java Anonymous Proxy (JAP or JonDonym) [23]:

Users can select among several Mix Cascades, different from P2P.

• PacketiX.NET [24]: Virtual LAN card and Virtual HUB by Ethernet and can provide layer 2 VPN virtualization.

• JanusVM [25]: Uses Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection -No update on project since 2010.

• proXPN [26]: A personal VPN that provides you safety and privacy while using the Internet.

• USAIP [27]: A VPN service provider with servers in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Hungary etc.

• VPNReactor [28]: Uses a VPN connection with time limits for free and pro service and user logs are kept for 5 days.


#### Windows Based Anonymity Tools

A number of windows based anonymity tools are large competitors of Tor network. Basic mechanisms of prominent anonymity tools are summarized in below lines:

• xB Browser [29]: A browser designed to run over the Tor network and XeroBank anonymity network.

• Hotspot Shield [30]: Uses VPN. Hosts web servers accessible through proxy and has a central server that can be compromised.

• AdvTor [31]: Acts as a portable client and server for the Tor network. Improvements include the UNI-CODE path, HTTP and HTTPS protocols, estimates AS paths etc.

• SecurityKISS [32]: A VPN service based on Open-VPN, PPTP and L2TP.

• CyberGhost VPN [34]: OpenVPN based proprietary client, Centralized server with VPN using 1024-SSL encryption.

• Freegate [35]: Uses range of proxy servers (called Dynaweb) along with encryption. 


#### Linux based solutions

Linux, being the prominent platform, is used by various anonymity tools to guarentee anonymity to its users. Working mechanism of some tools is summarized in below lines:

• Tails (Amnesic Incognito Live System) [36]: Has a Debian Linux distribution using Tor network.

• Privatix [37]: Provides encryption with anonymous web browsing (using Tor, Torbutton and firefox).


#### Anonymous Search Engines

Several search engines also provided anonymity to their users by collecting no user information. Some of these anonymous search engines are as follows:

• Ixquick [38]: Opens all search results through a proxy for anonymity.

• DuckDuckGo [39]: Provides searcher's privacy and avoids "filter bubble". Displays same information to all users for a given search.


#### Anonymous Emails

Anonymous emails are provided by many servers. In following lines, we have summarized the tools provided anonymous email capability to their users.

• Anonymous E-mail [40]: Sends the emails with anonymous senders.

• Safe-mail [41]: Provides a secure communication, storage, distribution and sharing system for the internet.

• HushMail [42]: Provides a PGP encrypted email service.

• 10 Minute Mail [43]: Gives an email address which expires after 10 minutes to counter spam emails.

• Yopmail [44]: Provides a disposable email address with no registration and password.


## Tor Research Areas

A large number of networks have utilized Tor networks for various purposes. To get an overview of the research areas dealt in various studies, we created a word cloud of the keywords of these studies. Figure 2 shows the word cloud of keywords (on log-scale) of all studies cited in this paper. Data of keywords shows that anonymity, privacy and security are the most important terms dealt in various studies.

In our review, we observed that research works on Tor could be broadly classified into three tracks/categories which include (1) deanonymization, (2) path selection, and (3) Analysis and performance improvement. Figure 3 shows the classification of our survey paper along with a list of all research works present in various subcategories.

In deanonymization track, research works were observed in six different categories covering (1) Hidden services which limit their scope to hidden servers identification, (2) Fingerprinting which are based on pinpointing Tor network, (3) Attacks which are focused over breaching Tor network, (4) Traffic analysis which analyze Tor traffic to pinpoint the weaknesses, (5) Studies studying improvements in Tor to avoid deanonymization, and (6) Anonymity without Tor which suggest alternate methods to provide anonymity by pinpointing weaknesses in Tor.

In the path-selection track, all research works are either based upon (1) Development of new algorithms providing better efficiency and anonymity, and (2) Analysis of Tor's algorithm to study its strong and weak points in circuit establishment mechanism.

Lastly, analysis and performance improvement track focuses on four sub-areas which include (1) Generalized studies over Tor providing usability and social implications, (2) Modelling studies which focus on the development of model for analysis of Tor, (3) Analysis studies which cover QoS, relays, servers, etc., (4) Performance improvement studies provide modification in relays and architecture to provide better QoS, and (5) Development of efficient mechanisms for Tor clients with mobility.  Figure 4 shows the classification of various research areas studied in the Tor network. It is pertinent to mention that all numeric values used for all pie charts, figures and tables in this paper have been calculated by the authors. Source of all numeric values is the 'Reference' section at the end of the paper, which includes scholarly research articles. Moreover, references have been collected by the authors from Tor repository 2 with a particular bias towards papers covering 'Tor' network only. Span of collection varies from 2007 to 2017 in reputed international conferences and journals. We also included the important studies in this field before 2007 which play helpful role in understanding of Tor network, such as [15] [17]. Many articles were also collected from 'ACM digital library' and 'IEEE Xplore digital library' with a particular focus towards anonymity and security in Tor.


### Tor Deanonymization

Breaching the Tor network is one of the most widely studied research problems. In fact, the majority of the studies describe deanonymization attacks without identifying any counter-measures [45]. Research works covering deanonymization can be subdivided into a number of subcategories including (1) Hidden services identification, (2) Tor traffic identification, (3) Attacking Tor network, (3) Traffic fingerprinting, (4) Focusing over Tor improvements, and (6) Providing anonymity without Tor. Classification of various research problems is shown in the pie chart in Figure 5. Table 4 presents a comparison of various research works in the Tor's deanonymization track. Prominent patterns show that relay compromise and traffic interception are the most frequent factors in deanonymizing Tor. This suggests that relays and traffic are more susceptible for exploitation than other factors. Individual details of various research 2 https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/ works in following subsections would explain this exploitation in much detail.


#### Tor Hidden Services

An important feature of the Tor network is provisioning of Tor service through a hidden server. A series of protocols used by hidden server and Tor users can make location of hidden server invisible to client [86]. However, several studies listed below address the deanonymization of hidden servers.

Locating Hidden Server: Overlier and Syverson [46] presented new attack strategies to detect the location of hidden servers using only one Tor node. They proposed changes in route selection and relay selection to increase anonymity. The average duration of the attack varied from minutes to a few hours. The various attacks they considered included the timing signature analysis attack, service location attack, predecessor attack and distance attack. Their proposed solution included introducing middleman nodes to connect to rendezvous points, introducing dummy traffic, extending hidden server path to rendezvous point and using guard entry nodes.

Timing Signature Attack: Elices et al. [47] presented a fingerprint analysis attack for Tor's hidden services. They used timestamps from logs of machines hosting hidden services on the Tor network to generate detectable fingerprints. The authors studied delay properties of the Tor network and other users' log entries to make the fingerprint attack feasible.

Application Layer Correlation Attack: Zhang et al. [48] described an application level HTTP-based attack for Tor's hidden services. Time correlation was used to assess the resemblance between web accesses and the traffic generated in a compromised Tor router. This attack assumes that the compromised onion router can operate as an entry relay.

Services of three different applications were analyzed, (1) Botnet for command and control, (2) Silk Road 3 and (3) DuckDuckGo 4 . The study identified major flaws of Tor that included the inflation and cheating of bandwidth by a corrupted relay node, and cheating marking mechanism of flags in Tor network from attacker relay node.


#### Tor Traffic Detection

A number of studies focus their research on the identification of Tor traffic form other network traffic. These studies suggest that differentiation of traffic can ultimately be used to block Tor traffic, as done by China a number of times in the recent past [55]. Various approaches for traffic identification are summarized as follows.

Tor Traffic Identification from Network Traffic: Bai et al. [50] studied the traffic identification mechanisms 3 Silk road was an online market place which provided anonymity to its customers by way of the Tor network. It was used in great part for the sale of drugs and illegal materials and was shutdown by the FBI. Defunct Website: http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion 4 DuckDuckGo is a search engine that does not track its users and provides anonymity to users by giving same search results for any query to all users. Website: https://duckduckgo.com of popular anonymity tools, i.e., Tor and Web-Mix. Authors used fingerprint identification (packet examination and packet context checking) followed by matching to identify the traffic. Key attributes used for traffic identification from other network traffic include specific strings, packet length and packet transmission frequency in the network.

Differentiate Tor Traffic from Encrypted Traffic: Barker et al. [51] showed that traffic from the Tor network can be differentiated form encrypted traffic in the network. They captured regular HTTPS, Tor HTTPS and HTTP traffic routed through Tor and analyzed their packet sizes and developed an unsupervised machine learning (ML) classifier that operates only on packet size attribute with 97.54% true positive (TP) and 1.06% false positive (FP) rates.

Differentiating Tor Traffic: AlSabah et al. [52] developed an ML classifier to differentiate web traffic from bulk download traffic. AlSabah et al. used the following four features to classify Tor traffic: (1) Circuit lifetime, (2) data transferred, (3) cell inter-arrival times, and (4) recently sent cells. They tested naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks and decision tree classifiers. Using the proposed classification method, they reported 75% improvement in responsiveness and 86% decrease in download rates.

Fingerprinting Tor traffic: Houmansadr et al. [53] aimed to differentiate the traffic of anonymous networks from other network traffic. They claimed that mimicking other traffic is an obsolete way for anonymity. They devised a number of passive and active attack strategies to breach anonymous networks. Their study suggested the use of partial imitation and use of new strategies by incorporating popular protocols like HTTPS email etc.

Tor Proxy Node Identification: Chakravarty et al. [54] described a novel attack that identifies all Tor relays participating in a given circuit. The attack modulates the bandwidth of an anonymous connection through a compromised server, router or an entry point and observes the resultant fluctuations in the Tor network using LinkWidth [87]. LinkWidth sends a train of pulses comprising of alternate TCP-SYN and TCP-RST packets and capacity is computed at the receiver end by estimating packet dispersion. Authors reported a 59.46% TP rate and 10% true negatives rate for compromised Tor relays using the proposed strategy.

Identification of Tor Bridges: Winter and Lindskog [55] conducted an extensive investigation into the blocking of Tor relays and bridges by China. Their investigation showed that Tor bridges were blocked by port tuples, rather than IP addresses and that bridges were blocked only when they were active. Their investigation also showed that adversaries did not conduct traffic fingerprinting for domestic traffic and that packet fragmentation could be used to circumvent China's firewall.

Fingerprinting Keywords in Search Queries: Oh et al. [88] investigated the viability of keyword fingerprinting attacks in the Tor network. Study showed that effective feature selection can help any passive adversary in figuring out the identity of the user. Time and volume of traffic play the most crucial role in determining the identity of the user. Among other features keyword sets, incremental search and high security search are other features used for classification. Experimental results demonstrated recall, precision and accuracy of 80%, 91% and 48%, respectively for one of 300 targeted keywords of Google.


#### Tor Attacks

Attacking the Tor network is an interesting research dimension which ultimately aims to block access to it. Several attempts by China and other countries have failed in the recent past because Tor is being improved continuously  [55]. In this subsection, we summarize various studies covering Tor attacks.

Unpopular Ports Attack: Sulaiman and Zhioua [56] described an attack they developed which can compromise circuits in the Tor network. Their attack takes advantage of unpopular ports in the Tor network. Sulaiman and Zhioua added a small number of compromised entry /exit relays to the Tor network (∼ 30 relays) which permit the use of unpopular ports. By doing so, 50% of developed circuits can be compromised, which significantly decreases the anonymity of the Tor network.

Circuit Clogging Attack: Chan-Tin et al. [57] proposed an attack that can identify the Tor routers used in any circuit. For the proposed attack a client connects to a malicious server which sends data to the client in large bursts and in small amounts. During large bursts, Tor routers take long times to process the extra amount of data. Authors showed that continuous monitoring of all Tor relays can identify the Tor relays used in the particular circuit. A mechanism to detect the behavior of malicious routers by the client was also evaluated, which measured network latency of the client.

Replay Attack: Pries et al. [20] suggested a replay attack to detect the exit routers in the Tor network. The replay attack assumes that the entry onion router is compromised. The replay attack duplicates packets coming from a sender. Tor uses counter-mode Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-CTR) [89] 5 for encryption and decryption, any duplicate cells will give a cell recognition error at the exit routers. This behavior leaks exit router information to the entry router by simple correlation.

Flow Multiplication Attack: Wang et al.

[58] designed a flow multiplication attack similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. The attack assumes that the exit router is compromised. Whenever a client sends a request to target server, the exit router returns a malicious page which triggers certain fetch requests in the client browser over the same circuit. An accomplice at the entry router can see the requests, and together with knowledge of the exit relay, 5 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an encryption standard which is based upon substitution-permutation technique. It has three members Rijndael family each with block size of 128 bits and key lengths of 128,192   identify the complete Tor circuit. Attack Using Game Theory and Data Mining: Wagner et al. [59] proposed an attack which exploits the exit malicious exit node to cluster observed traffic flows using an active tag injection scheme. The proposed method has two steps, (1) image tags are injected into HTML replies from the exit node to the user, and (2) a semi-supervised learning algorithm based upon deep data mining is used to reconstruct the entire browsing session of the user. The authors model the Tor network in form of a game theoretical concept where all Tor users and rogue nodes play a game for identification of malicious node. Once a rogue node has been identified, it's game is over because no other user uses it due to presence of special flag in it. Authors main aim is to work over over the equilibrium between rogue nodes and Tor users.

Attack using Destroy and DNS Requests: Benmeziane and Badache [60] investigated possible breaches of Tor targeting its network requests. They exploited destroy requests (Tor's circuit destruction requests) and DNS requests to break anonymity. Destroy requests are not encrypted, which poses a serious threat to Tor. Moreover, a local eavesdropper can use the man-in-the-middle attack strategy against DNS requests, which are unprotected.

The Sniper Attack: Jansen et al. [61] presented the Sniper attack, a low-resource denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the Tor network which can disable arbitrary relays. The adversary builds a Tor circuit through the target relay and starts obtaining a large file by continuously sending the SENDME cells (protocol messages for continuously receiving the file), which increases the congestion window size. By repeating over multiple circuits, memory of host of target relay would exhaust which can disrupt the functioning of Tor relay. Experiments showed that an adversary can consume 2, 187 KB/s memory of a victim relay at the cost of very little bandwidth and decrease Tor network bandwidth by as much as 35%.

Browser-based Attacks: Abbot et al. [62] proposed a novel attack that tricks a user's web browser into sending a distinctive signal over the Tor network (by installing a Java or HTML script). An attacker that controls an exit relay can use it in a man-in-the-middle attack to mirror and forward duplicated traffic to a malicious server. By analyzing the data, the malicious server can deanonymize the Tor user. However, this study makes two significant assumptions: the ability to control the exit relay and the ability to configure / compromise a targeted user's web browser.

Congestion Attack using Long Paths: Evans et al. [63] proposed an extension to the congestion attack proposed by Murdoch and Danezis [70] owing to the enormity of the current Tor network. Evans et al. proposed the combination of Javascript injection and DoS attack. A Tor exit relay is used by the attacker to inject Javascript code into a user's browser, which makes the browser send a response every second. They suggested modifications such as disabling JavaScript, thwarting DoS attack by disabling ability to control latency of routers. In the modified design, routers keep a track of all paths with flags and disable any request for latency by using flags.

Exploiting Routing Algorithm: Bauer et al. [64] exploited Tor's routing algorithm to steer a disproportionate number of users towards selecting their entry and exit relays from a set of malicious Tor routers. Bauer at al. suggested that low-latency constraints force Tor's routing algorithm to prefer nodes advertising high bandwidths. Instead of performing complex traffic analysis techniques, the authors suggested to collect detailed flow logs from malicious nodes (both entry and exit nodes) and use the information of node selection to deanonymize flows.

Analyzing Autonomous Systems for Tor Path Selection: Edman and Syverson [65] analyzed the effect of autonomous systems (AS) for path selection in Tor network. They studied the selection of AS residing in different countries and found it quite effective. Traffic analysis of the Tor network showed that majority of traffic passes through a few ASs because all established paths focus over latency and anonymity which occurs better in some ASs. Analysis shows that increase in relays has not increased the diversity to a large extent.

DoS Attack using Cell Flooding: Barbera et al. [21] presented a novel attack which generates a few circuits requiring large computing and networking resources. Their study showed that this attack requires only 0.2% resources for old routers and 1 − 16% router resources for new attacks, which makes it an inexpensive attack to execute. Barbera et al. proposed a mitigation scheme by placing an upper cap on the utilization of resources at routers.

Exploiting peer-to-peer application: Le Blond et al. [66] suggested that peer-to-peer applications can be exploited to trace IP addresses of users running Tor. Moreover, scan of malicious Tor exit relays should be used to correlate various user streams for deanonymization. Experiments showed that their 'bad apple' attack was able to identify 193% more streams, including 27% HTTP streams, and reveal IP addresses of 10, 000 Tor users. This constituted 9% of all the flows passing through the exit relays under their control.

Induced Throttling Attacks: Geddes et al. [67] proposed a new attack which breaches the Tor network by exploiting its selection bias in favor of high capacity relay nodes. Authors showed that induced throttling at the corrupt exit node by exploiting congestion or traffic shaping algorithms can induce similar traffic patterns at other relays associated with the corrupted exit relay.

Using Decoy Traffic: Chakravarty et al. [68] used decoy traffic on anonymous networks to detect traffic interception. The proposed strategy is based on the idea of injecting traffic containing bait credentials for decoy services requiring user authentication. Chakravarty et al. set up decoy IMAP and SMTP servers and identified ten instances of traffic interception over ten months.


#### Tor Traffic Analysis Attacks

A few studies have focused on the analysis of Tor traffic for breaching this network. Analysis shows that traffic analysis can provide an efficient mechanism for deanonymization. A few of these studies are summarized as follows.

Traffic Correlation Attacks: Johnson et al. [69] conducted a thorough analysis of the Tor network with a deep focus on the development of a threat model. They built the Tor path simulator (TorPS) to assess Tor's vulnerability to correlation based attacks. Their study suggested that a single Tor relay adversary can deanonymize 80% of users within six months. This research showed that set of relays is dependent upon the user's application which reduces security of the Tor network.

Using Timing Signature: Murdoch and Danezis [70] presented a simple mechanism to evaluate the Tor nodes being used in a circuit. In the proposed scheme, a malicious node sends probe data to the Tor relays. All Tor relays used in the circuit will experience a delay and clientserver communication will be modulated. Hence, correlation between delay and modulation gives insight about the relays being used in a circuit.

Traffic Analysis Attack: Chakravarty et al. [71] used NetFlow data to analyze the effectiveness of traffic analysis attacks against Tor network. Their proposed attack creates variations in traffic at the server end and observes the effects at a colluding server at the other end. They reported 81.4% accuracy in real-world experiments with 6.4% FP rates.

Queue Scheduling and Resource Allocation: Zhang et al. [72] proposed a priority queue scheduling mechanism to reduce the correlation between high load and high latency which would ultimately increase the level of anonymity. However, increase in anonymity comes at the cost of latency which degrades quality of service at the user end. Extensive experiments using the proposed mechanism showed an increase in anonymity due to decrease in correlation between load and latency.

Correlation Using K-means Algorithm: Song et al. [73] applied machine learning techniques to deanonymize Tor flows at the first hop and last hop in the network. They used the time / stream size tuple of attributes together with the k-means algorithm to deanonymize by matching first hop traffic with last hop traffic. Their results showed that as little as 8 packets are enough to deanonymize a Tor stream with greater than 99% accuracy.

Website Fingerprinting Using Machine Learning: Panchenko et al. [74] suggested the use of machine learning approaches requiring feature selection and classification for website fingerprinting. Authors used Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with various features including packet sizes (except 52 size packets because of excess use in acknowledgements), packet size markers to express direction of flow, HTML markers, total transmitted bytes, number markers, occurring packet sizes, percentage incoming packets and number of packets. Extensive research showed that volume, time and direction of the traffic were the most promising features and classification of close-world and open-world dataset gave 55% detection rate. However, camouflaging the traffic decreased the detection rate to 3%.

Website Fingerprinting Using New Metrics: Wang and Goldberg [22] proposed the use of Tor cells as a unit of data transfer rather TCP/IP packets for website fingerprinting. Authors collected data using realistic assumptions on adversaries from client to entry guard node. The study suggested the removal of SENDME cells as they do not play any significant role in improving performance. Proposed metrics use the observation that dynamic content is present in only incoming packets and it is present at the end of the packets. Upto 95% recall rate and 0.2% FP rate is observed using SVM classifier.

Wavelet Decomposition Attack: Jin and Wang [75] suggested a wavelet based decomposition mechanism to estimate the distortion in timing at the receiver end of Tor network. Authors showed that wavelet based multi-resolution analysis (MRA) captures the variability of the timing distortion at all levels, with better granularity than traditional estimation of timing distortion. Deanonymization rate of 96% was obtained for Tor at a packet rate of 4 pkts/sec in 3 minutes without changing established paths (circuits) of Tor. Analysis showed that Tor circuit rotation could decrease the accuracy of deanonymization to 72% after 5 Tor circuit rotations in 3 minutes.

Exploiting Side-channels to Identify Clients: Gilad and Herzberg [76] exploited three kinds of side-channels including (1) globally incrementing IP identifiers, (2) packet processing delays, and (3) bogus-congestion events. Sequential port allocation is also used to identify the clients. Two scenarios for breaching have been presented including (1) fully off-path attack to detect TCP connections, and (2) detecting Tor connections by eavesdropping on clients.


#### Tor Improvements

In this section, we present some miscellaneous studies about improvement in Tor network by focusing on Tor relays, path selection mechanisms, transport layer protocols and application layer improvements.

Misusing Tor Exit Node: Gros et al. [77] studied the abuse and misuse of Tor exit nodes to compromise the anonymity of the Tor network. Authors proposed a mechanism, called Honeywall, to avoid misuse of any Tor exit node. According to Honeywall, whenever any exit node detects a malicious behavior, it lowers the reputation of the immediate predecessor router and also sends an alert to it. Similarly, the intermediate router lowers the reputation of its predecessor router. Through this strategy, all "bad" nodes eventually end up with lower reputations and all "good" nodes have higher reputation.

Exposing Exit Relays: Winter and Lindskog [78] detected malicious exit Tor relays and profiled their behavior. An exit relay scanner was built to identify all outgoing Tor traffic and identify the malicious nodes and avoid man-inthe-middle attacks. Patches were built for the Tor browser bundle to collect certificates through multiple paths to check authenticity of the destination server.

Tuning mechanism for Tor: Xin and Neng [79] showed that Tor lacks the evaluation system for the node store. Authors presented and theoretically analyzed a tuning mechanism for Tor. The proposed tuning system included the establishment of an evaluation system and optimization of Tor node store and output mode. Through the evaluation system, all nodes are ranked based on their anonymity, uptime, bandwidth and latency. In the optimization stage authors suggested to use a fixed number of circuits such that traffic load has least effect on latency.

Increasing Security of Tor Network: Backes et al. [80] conducted research on the security of Tor network for anonymous browsing and presented a novel security protocol. Authors elaborated the concept of security in anonymity softwares. Their study showed that current key exchange algorithms are inefficient and a number of security enhancements were suggested including cryptographic requirements for secure browsing.

Transport Layer Improvements: Marks et al. [81] studied TCP based deficiencies in the Tor network. By studying the transmission mechanism of Tor, authors proposed to split bidirectional links into two separate TCP links. Experiments with separate TCP links showed 100% increase in throughput with a decrease in throughput variance from 43000 KB/s to 10000 KB/s [91].

Switching to uTCP and uTLS: Nowlan et al. [82] probed into the cross-stream head of line blocking problem of TCP in the Tor network. Their study suggested the use of unordered TCP (uTCP) and unordered TCL (uTLS) for reducing inter-dependence in inter-leaving streams, due to the requirement of low latency in the Tor network.

Feasibility of DOS attack over Tor: Danner et al. [83] conducted a deep investigation on the feasibility of Denialof-Service (DoS) attack (proposed in a previous study by Borisov et al. [92]) over Tor network. Authors showed through simulations and analytical evaluations that corrupted relay nodes can be used to exploit Tor network and perform DoS attack. Authors suggested the use of reliable guard nodes (entry and exit) which can decrease the probability of selection of a corrupt Tor relay.


#### Anonymity without Tor

To present a glimpse of studies providing anonymity without Tor, we present a few studies focusing on packet encapsulation and central server based anonymity mechanism.

Anonymity Using a Central Server: Herzberg et al. [84] proposed a camouflaged browsing design using a camouflaged server. The basic idea is to communicate with the camouflaged server using a manner similar to popular web services. Encrypted communication, URLs of GMAIL with packet frequency and sizing similar to GMAIL can easily pass unnoticed through any adversary. Although this design provides better anonymity, it suffers from a single point of failure.

In-Network IP Anonymization Service: Mendonca et al. [85] presented a novel idea of user anonymity by working with a network service provider. Proposed service AnonyFlow used an in-network IP anonymization service. The fundamental idea was to conceal the source identifier from the other side of the network. An OpenFlow based implementation was used for performance evaluation. However, anonymity could be breached by compromising the network service provider.


### Tor Path Selection

Tor selects three relays based upon its path selection algorithm which incorporates anonymity and reliability characteristics of relays and users [93]. By compromising the path selection mechanism, the complete anonymity mechanism of Tor can be breached. In this subsection, we present studies covering (1) new algorithms for path selection, and (2) analysis of path selection algorithms. An overview showing the classification of major studies is shown in Figure 6. Table 5 presents a comparison of various research works in Tor's path selection track. Comparison shows that performance and anonymity were the most frequently studied parameters for path selection. However, majority studies neglected autonomous systems, relay locations, hop counts, multi-path mechanisms, load and relay capacity. Moreover, majority research works focus on the development of new algorithms while few studies analysed the current path selection algorithms.


#### New Path Selection Algorithms

LASTor -Low Latency with Better Anonymity Algorithm: Akhoondi et al. [94] proposed a new path selection algorithm namely LASTor. LASTor incorporates the locations of relays before choosing paths and does not always select the shortest path as it reduces the entropy of path selection. Moreover, LASTor avoids paths passing through ASs which can compromise anonymity of the system by traffic correlation.  New Path Selection Algorithms Akhoondi et al. [94] Included relay locations and autonomous system reliability Chen et al. [95] Included hops and geographic distance in path selection Karaoglu et al. [96] Studied multipath design Panchenko et al. [97] Studied Load and Capacity at nodes Li et al. [98] Proposed tunable mechanism varying between anonymity and performance Panchenko et al. [99] Studied latency, link capacity and load at nodes Liu and Wang [100] Proposed random walk based circuit building protocol Liu and Wang [101] Proposed new relay selection mechanism with backup circuit algorithm Snader and Borisov [102] Studied malicious nodes, proposed balance between anonymity and performance Li et al. [103] Proposed relay recommendation system Tang and Goldberg [104] Suggested the use of bursty circuits instead of busy paths Wang et al. [105] Included latency as a measure of congestion in path selection Snader and Borisov [106] Suggested opportunistic bandwidth measurement with priority based traffic handling Elahi et al. [107] Discouraged short term entry guard churn and time-based entry guard rotation Analysis of Path Selection Bauer et al. [108] Suggested random or Snader-Borisov approach for router selection Wacek et al. [109] Suggested bandwidth weighted relay selection and avoidance of congested circuits

Optimizing Hops, Performance flags and Geographic Distance: Chen and Pasquale et al. [95] studied the path selection mechanism by varying the number of hops, performance ratings and changing the geographic distance between routers. Trade-offs between anonymity and other parameters (latency etc.) were extensively evaluated. The authors concluded that reduction in hops and geographic distance can increase throughput and decrease anonymity.

Using MultiPath Routing Karaoglu et al. [96] evaluated the multipath design for Tor network to avoid congestion and overcome the limitations in Tor's circuit construction. Evaluations revealed a four-fold increase in throughput with better load balancing and traffic mixing. However, high buffer costs at the Tor proxies were the major limitations of multipath design.

Path Selection Using Load and Capacity of Nodes: Panchenko et al. [97] studied the delays in the Tor network and provided new measures in path selection to improve user experience. Two factors used for path selection design are "load" at the nodes and maximum "capacity" at the nodes. Authors showed that these factors can increase the performance by 70%. Their study concludes that nodes, not edges, are the deciding factors for performance.

Tunable Mechanism of Tor: Li et al. [98] emphasized the development of a tunable mechanism for Tor users depending on anonymity and performance required by users. Authors used "path length" as a metric to tune user requirements based upon anonymity and performance followed by client side modifications of Tor protocol. Results showed that browsing time deteriorates quickly from 14.4 to 140.1secs with a 37.3% increase in failure rate by increasing the path length from 2 to 6. The proposed mechanism requires only client side modification.

Using Latency and Link Capacity: Panchenko et al. Random Walk Based Circuit Building Protocol: Liu and Wang [100] presented a random walk based circuit building protocol (RWCBP) which is a two-step method: circuit construction, followed by application message transmission. Network latency, computational latency and transmission loads were used to analyze the performance of the proposed protocol. Using indexes of performance and anonymity, resilience of the proposed protocol was analyzed.

New Circuit Building Protocol: Liu and Wang [101] studied the current protocol of the Tor network and proposed a novel circuit building design with two phases: selection of user selectable relay nodes and circuit construction. Authors presented enhancements in the selection of relay nodes, fast circuit construction and backup circuit algorithm. Better performance and user experience are obtained with the new protocol while achieving the same level of anonymity.

Tunable Path Selection for Better Security and Performance: Snader and Borisov [102] addressed the issue of the selection of malicious nodes in the path selection due to self-advertised bandwidth. Authors proposed an algorithm which is based upon the anonymity and performance in the Tor network. Significant performance gains were observed using the proposed strategy with single and multipath route selection.

Relay Recommendation System: Li et al. [103] proposed a relay recommendation system to provide reliable information about all relays for building circuits (paths). Its main goals include the mitigation of low-resource attacks, better performance and tradeoffs between anonymity and performance. Authors proposed path selection algorithms for increased anonymity. Significant performance gains with increase in anonymity were observed in the simulations of the proposed scheme.

Preferring Bursty Circuits over Busy Circuits: Tang and Goldberg [104] proposed a new algorithm which suggests the use of bursty circuits instead of busy circuits. Authors suggest that bursty circuits (such as web browsing) can provide less latency than the busy circuits (used for bulk data transfer). Proposed circuit selection algorithm uses exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of cells sent on any path and uses the path with lowest EWMA (because new and bursty paths have high EWMA).

Incorporating Congestion in Path Selection: Wang et al. [105] proposed a novel path selection algorithm which incorporates the latency of nodes as a measure for congestion. The proposed algorithm favors nodes which provide lower latency. Study suggests that node latency is greater than the link latency in majority of the cases. Authors conclude that the proposed algorithm can reduce latency by upto 40%.

Opportunistic Bandwidth Measurement Algorithm: Snader and Borisov [106] addressed Tor's shortcoming of favoring high bandwidth nodes based on advertised bandwidth. Their study showed that an opportunistic measurement of bandwidth for all routers by other connected routers can reduce the vulnerability risk by any adversary in Tor. Moreover, priority based traffic handling, i.e., high performance or high anonymity can reduce the risk of partitioning attacks.

Analyzing and Improving Entry Guard Selection: Elahi et al. [107] conducted an in depth investigation on the selection of entry guards in Tor network. The study showed that short-term entry guard churn and explicit time-based entry guard rotation result in an increased usage of entry guards in clients, which results in a greater number of profiling attacks.

Trust-Aware Path Selection Algorithm: Johnson et al. [110] proposed a path selection algorithm which uses the probability based distribution to keep itself aware of the location of adversaries in the Tor network. In developing trust based model, authors take the relays uptime as the most trustworthy factor in determining the selection of the path. Bypassing the paths containing adversaries can mitigate the traffic analysis attacks conducted by the adversaries.


#### Analysis of Path Selection

Predicting Path Compromise: Bauer et al. [108] showed that the current mechanism of Tor is vulnerable to path compromise because Tor selects paths based on bandwidth capabilities of routers. Study shows that the application level protocol is a significant factor to predict path compromise. Research suggests that router selection should be random or through Snader-Borisov approach to avoid any bias in router selection. Study showed that most robust applications for path compromise are HTTP and HTTPs applications while the most vulnerable are peer-to-peer applications.

Empirical Evaluation of Relay Selection: Wacek et al. [109] evaluated the relay selection mechanism of Tor to estimate latency. Performance and anonymity were analyzed for a number of relay selection techniques under varying load conditions. The authors suggest that a combination of bandwidth-weighted relay selection and avoidance of congested circuits can provide better throughput and less latency.


### Tor Analysis and Performance Improvements

In this section, we cover studies on Tor dealing with its analysis and performance improvement mechanisms. Classification of various studies is shown in Figure 7. Table 6 presents a comparison of various generalized studies covering the modelling of Tor network. Comparison shows that majority studies focused over analysis of Tor network. Moreover, usability analysis and anonymity analysis were the most frequently studied topics followed by performance analysis. Very few research works focused over the sociability issues of Tor network. Discussed challenges and social issues, and studied Tor network Abou-Tair et al. [112] Studied usability, bandwidth and anonymity over anonymous networks Clark et al. [113] Performed usability analysis of Tor with other anonymity tools Edmundson et al. [114] Compared anonymity and performance of Safeplug with Tor

Barthe et al. [115] Studied robustness in Tor network Mulazzani et al. [116] Analysed monitoring and anonymity issues in Tor

Huber et al. [117] Studied anonymity using HTTP usage statistics McCoy et al. [118] Studied applications, usage statistic and misusage of Tor Loesing et al. [119] Studied country and port usage of Tor Chen et al. [120] Proposed anonymous payments over anonymous network Modelling Tor network Jansen et al. [121] Proposed graph based Tor topology Jansen and Hopper [122] Developed discrete event Tor simulatork

Bauer et al. [123] Developed emulation toolkit ExperimenTor for Tor


#### General Studies of Tor

Several studies covering pros and cons of Tor and analyzing statistics of Tor referring to users' quality of experience are summarized in the paragraphs below.

Understanding Challenges and Social Factors: In [111], Dingledine et al. described the challenges in implementation of Tor and discussed social issues. Tor network design and its details were also discussed with reference to the previous state-of-the-art. Possible avenues for improvements in the Tor network and flaws in the current system were presented including abuse, security implications and perceived social value.

Who is More User Friendly ? Abou-Tair et al. [112] focused on the usability of different anonymizing solutions including Tor, I2P 6 , JAP/JonDo (Java Anonymous Proxy) 7 and Mixmaster 8 . The installation of all softwares was analyzed with regard to ease-of-use. They measured the bandwidth consumption of all softwares. The authors concluded that I2P and Mixmaster provide better anonymity but are more complex. On the contrary, Tor and JAP are easy to use but comprise somewhat on the degree of anonymity they provide. 6 I2P is an anonymous overlay network which supports both TCP and UDP traffic. Web: https://geti2p.net/en/ 7 Java Anon Proxy allows web browsing with pseudonymity using its proxy based system. Web: https://anonymous-proxy-servers. net/ 8 Mixmaster is a Chaumian mix network which is an anonymous remailer providing security against traffic analysis and sender deanonymization. Web: http://mixmaster.sourceforge.net/ Usability Analysis of Tor: Clark et al. [113] conducted usability analysis for deployment of Tor and software tools associated with Tor including Vidalia, Privoxy, Torbutton and FoxyProxy. Research showed that all implementations have associated pros and cons. The study presented guidelines for future implementations for maximum usability of anonymity tools. Research spanned over the installation, configuration, usage menu, verification and switch-off features of various anonymity tools.

Safeplug vs. Tor: Edmundson et al. [114] analyzed the security provided by Safeplug in comparison to the Tor network. Safeplug 9 is a plug-and-play network device which is plugged into the router and it acts as an HTTP proxy by directing all web traffic through the Tor network. Safeplug was launched to provide ease in access for Tor users. On the contrary, Tor network can be accessed through Tor browser bundle provided by Tor. Study showed that Safeplug was vulnerable to first and thirdparty trackers, through which users can be deanonymized. Attacker can modify the settings of Safeplug externally through cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Safeplug provided more latency and less protection than Tor.

Robustness of Tor: Barthe et al. [115] argued that robustness has always been neglected while privacy is the issue that receives most attention. Authors defined general and flexible definitions for robustness and studied the Golle and Juels protocol. By identifying the weaknesses in the current protocol, novel enhancements were also proposed for robustness.

Anonymity and Monitoring on Tor: Mulazzani et al. [116] addressed the Monitoring and Anonymity issues in the current Tor network. A dataset was collected over a period of six months. Analysis showed that a sinusoidal pattern in users is observed with half of servers located in Germany and United States. A proposed implementation has been added into TorStatus 10 , which is the project displaying Tor network status, available routers, bandwidths, hosts and availability history.

Tor Traffic Statistics: Huber et al. [117] analyzed the HTTP usage of the Tor network. Research showed that 78% of Tor users do not use Tor using TorButton, which can be used for deanonymization. 1% of Tor requests are vulnerable to piggybacking attacks. 7% requests, pertaining to social networks, contain identifiable information. The authors suggested the use of HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication.

Tor Usage Statistics: McCoy et al. [118] studied the applications, user countries and usage of Tor network. Statistics collected from Tor showed that non-interactive protocols (BitTorrent traffic), comprising of a minority of connections, consumed majority of resources. Non-secure protocols like HTTP can be exploited by the exit router to log sensitive information. The study suggested a protocol for identification of all exit routers capturing POP3 traffic. Usage statistics revealed that USA, Germany and China are major users of Tor.

Statistical Data of Tor: Loesing et al. [119] collected the statistics from the live Tor network to measure two aspects of communication, i.e., (1) country wise usage, and (2) traffic port numbers for exiting traffic. Both these statistics can be used for future improvements in the Tor network for better anonymity services. The study also revealed that port 80 receives most traffic.

Micropayments Using Tor: Chen et al. [120] proposed a novel mechanism of anonymous payments for network services. The proposed mechanism allows users to make  untraceable micro-payments to each other. Authors included features of offline verification, overspending prevention, aggregation and low overheads. Experiments showed only 4% overhead for the proposed strategy.


#### Modeling Tor Network

In this section, we present the modeling techniques used for analyzing Tor.

Modeling Topology and Hosts of Tor: Jansen et al. [121] developed a model of Tor which closely resembled the Tor network. Authors developed a graph for Tor topology where vertexes related to downstream bandwidth, upstream bandwidth and packet loss, and edges related to latency, jitter and packet loss. All hosts including relays, authorities, clients and Internet servers were mapped to the developed graph based on characteristics obtained from Tor.

Shadow: Simulating Tor Network Jansen and Hopper [122] developed an open source discrete event simulator for simulating the network layer of Tor on a single machine. Authors compared the performance of Shadow with realworld simulation results from the PlanetLab testbed.

Emulation Toolkit for Tor Experimentation: Bauer et al. [123] developed ExperimenTor, an emulation toolkit for Tor network. Their research was focused on the toolkit rather than the analysis of the Tor network.


#### Analysis of Tor

Analysis of Tor network has been a part of many studies covering delays, bandwidth, quality of service, relay selection and authentication protocols. Several studies covering these areas are summarized in following sections. Table 7 presents a comparison of various research works in analysis and performance improvement track. Comparison shows that relay selection and latency analysis are the most frequently studied topics followed by anonymity, bandwidth and quality of service analysis. Very few studies focused over queues, traffic shaping techniques and protocol messages.

Understanding Delays in Tor: Dhungel et al. [124] analyzed the delays in the entire Tor network. Authors suggested that overlay network plays the most significant role in Tor. The study revealed that 11% of Tor routers are overloaded with traffic which resulted in very high delays. In 7.5% of circuits, overall latency introduced a 450ms delays. Guard routers incorporate more delay than nonguard routers. There is high fluctuation in delay for all routers except for those having high bandwidths.

Measurement and Statistics: Loesing et al. [125] studied the latencies inside the Tor network. A deep investigation was conducted to evaluate the individual delays and QoS properties. The authors showed that circuit building time (Introduction and Rendezvous) is the most crucial delay period in Tor. Fréchet and exponential distributions were combined to analyze the response times. Analysed latency for Tor relays Loesing et al. [125] Analysed latency, QoS and performance of Tor Ehlert et al. [126] Studied bandwidth and latency in Tor Pries et al. [127] Investigated bandwidth for various path selection algorithms Liu and Wang [128] Proposed relay reliability mechanism considering performance anonymity and QoS Wang et al. [129] Performed an empirical analysis over family nodes Tschorsch and Scheuermann [130] Proposed fairness model for efficient and fair resource allocation Chaabane et al. [131] Studied misuse of Tor's exit nodes as proxies

Hopper et al. [132] Analysed Tor's performance considering key exchange mechanisms Lenhard et al. [133] Studied communication overhead in low bandwidth networks for Tor's hidden services Goldberg [134] Analysed anonymity with Tor;s authentication protocol Tor performance improvement Jansen et al. [135] Proposed token based performance mechanisms for recruiting more relays Dingledine et al. [136] Proposed priority based traffic handling for relays Wang et al. [137] Proposed node reliability mechanism to avoid blockage of bridges Smits et al. [138] Proposed packet authorization based mechanism to protect bridges from eavesdroppers Moghaddam et al. [139] Proposed traffic morphing (using Skype traffic) to avoid censorship Weinberg et al. [140] Proposed traffic shaping (by assembling regular HTTP traffic) to avoid deanonymization Gopal and Heninger [141] Suggested latency reduction by separate TCP connections for interactive and bulk traffic AlSabah et al. [142] Proposed traffic morphing (using Skype traffic) to avoid censorship Jansen et al. [143] Proposed throttling mechanisms for reducing latency by avoiding bulk traffic

Comparing Bandwidth with Latency: Ehlert [126] compared the bandwidth and latency performance of Tor network with the popular I2P network. Authors measured the core latency (HTTP GET requests durations), average latency (webpage download times including external threads and pictures) and bandwidth (download speeds). This research showed that I2P network provides lower core latency and Tor network excels in average latency and bandwidth, owing to the nodes distribution and penetration of the Tor network.

Tor QoS with Path Selection Strategy: Pries et al. [127] suggested that TCP suffers severe performance degradation from the random path selection of Tor. Slight QoS improvement is achieved with Tor's bandwidth weighted path selection algorithm. The main reason attributed for small improvements is low bandwidth of Tor routers.

Investigating Tor's Exit Policies: Liu and Wang [128] studied the exit policies of the exit nodes and addressed the short-comings in the current Tor architecture. A new protocol was proposed which comprised of three parts: (1) reporting misbehavior protocol, (2) building global blacklist protocol, and (3) blocking misbehavior protocol for users. User experience, performance and anonymity were the key indexes used for evaluation.

Behavior of Family Nodes: Wang et al. [129] presented an empirical analysis of Tor family nodes. A rich dataset of live Tor network comprising of three years was used to study the impact of family nodes. The study suggested that family nodes provide stable and better service than other nodes. Moreover, attacks on family nodes can disrupt the Tor network more severely than random Tor nodes.

Fairness in Tor: Tschorsch and Scheuermann [130] analyzed the fairness issues in the current Tor network. Large unfairness was observed in the current resource allocation mechanism of the Tor network. Authors proposed a maxmin fairness based model for efficient and fair scheduling of resources. The proposed design was analyzed with Tor's N 23 congestion feedback mechanism.

Misuse of Tor: Chaabane et al. [131] showed that Tor network was being used for transmitting P2P traffic (Bit torrent etc.) over the Tor network. HTTP and Bit torrent were analyzed on the Tor network. The study showed that Tor exit nodes are being used as one hop SOCKS proxies through tunneling. New techniques were devised to detect such abnormalities in exit nodes' behavior. Research showed that simple crawling over exit nodes can be used to collect as many bridge identities as needed.

Challenges for Hidden Services of Tor: Hopper [132] conducted research on the poor performance of Tor based on the fact that users of Tor increased from 1 million to nearly 6 million but no dramatic change was observed in the network. Hopper attributed the poor performance to the key exchange mechanism of Tor, which was later updated. Study showed the possible research dimensions of limiting request rates from botnets, throttling entry guard, reusing failed partial circuits and isolating hidden services circuits.

Tor Hidden Services in Low Bandwidth Access Networks: Lenhard et al. [133] conducted a measurement and statistical analysis for estimating the communication overhead of Tor hidden services in low bandwidth access networks. Research showed that boot strapping time, RTT and circuit building time were the major bottlenecks to performance. Due to numerous delays, an increase in timeout value was suggested to avoid repeated retransmissions.

Analysis of Tor Authentication Protocol: Goldberg [134] analyzed the security of Tor's authentication protocol (TAP). The authors argued that any security breach by a single malicious Tor relay can deanonymize users' sessions. Through empirical evaluations, research showed that TAP is secure in random oracle model.

Statistics Collection Mechanism of Tor: Mani and Sherr [144] analysed the data collection mechanism of Tor through 'PrivEx'. They showed that statistics of PrivEx can be easily compromised by the present of adversary nodes in the Tor network. As a result of shortcomings of PrivEx, authors proposed 'HisTor', a privacy preserving statistics collection mechanism of Tor which is much more diverse than PrivEx. HisTor uses the count of queries by exit nodes and relays in form of a histogram where individual nodes have little control over the aggregate statistics.


#### Tor Performance Improvement

Owing to the increasing demand for Tor, various studies have proposed performance improvements to cope with future demands. In this section, we present these studies covering Tor node selection, traffic distribution and latency management etc.

Node Recruitment for Tor: Jansen et al. [135] focused their research on recruitment of new Tor relays, motivated by the fact that only 1.5% nodes participate as relays. Authors proposed BRAIDS which is a token based mechanism providing high bandwidth to those users who employ BRAIDS. Proposed scheme characterizes traffic into high throughput, low latency and normal traffic. Based upon usage of BRAIDS and node networking stats, tickets are generated which can be used to increase bandwidth.

Encouraging Tor nodes for traffic relaying: Dingledine et al. [136] proposed a mechanism to encourage Tor nodes for traffic relaying. Study suggested a priority based traffic handling, which gives more weight (in form of bandwidth and delays) to those nodes contributing resources to Tor. However, all Tor relays carry an additional load of priority based traffic handling. Directory authorities need to assign priority levels to all Tor users participating in Tor relays.

Improving Distribution Mechanism of Tor Bridges: Wang et al. [137] improved the distribution mechanism of Tor bridges by implementing node reliability statistics to avoid the blockage of bridges by corrupt nodes. The uptime of assigned bridges is used to give reputation points to users. In case of any blockage of a bridge, a new bridge address is given on payment of earned credit. To ensure anonymity, reputation information is stored on users' systems by using a privacy-preserving technique which cannot be circumvented by malicious users.

Packet Authorization for Tor Bridges: Smits et al. [138] proposed BridgeSPA, a packet authorization based mechanism, to protect users of Tor hosting Bridges. All Tor user hosting bridges are susceptible to traffic analysis attacks. To counter this attack, the authors suggest the transmission of a bridge key by bridge distribution authorities which is valid for a limited time, as determined by the bridge. For any communication with the bridge, Tor users should use that key within the assigned time period.

SkypeMorph -Tor traffic Shaping: Moghaddam et al. [139] proposed a new mechanism namely SkypeMorph to avoid the censorship of Tor bridges. The fundamental idea was to hide Tor traffic as Skype video traffic (a widely used protocol). SkypeMorph, which runs side by side with Tor, makes it hard to distinguish Tor traffic from Skype traffic. Two schemes were suggested for traffic morphing, (1) using the target stream attributes, (2) incorporating both source and destination streams to incorporate packet timings. Both streams provided nearly identical performance, but the former had lower complexity.

StegoTorus -Steganographing Tor Traffic: Weinberg et al. [140] proposed a novel technique to bypass censorship on Tor. Their scheme is based upon the idea of chopping Tor traffic into multiple streams, resembling HTTP traffic, before passing through the censor. StegoTorus acted as a proxy on Tor clients.

Torchestra -Separate connections for Interactive and Bulk Traffic: Gopal and Heninger [141] proposed the transmission of interactive and bulk traffic over two separate TCP connections among all nodes in the Tor network. Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) algorithm was used to distinguish between interactive and bulk traffic on all circuits. Upto 40% reduction in delays was observed as compared to standard Tor for the proposed strategy.

Reducing Latency in Tor: AlSabah et al. [142] proposed a mechanism for congestion control and flow control in order to reduce latency in the Tor network. The study suggested the use of small fixed size windows and small dynamic windows which can reduce the packets in flight. For flow control, the study proposed an N23 algorithm which caps the queue lengths of Tor routers and provided a 65% increase in webpage responses and 32% decrease in page loading time.

Throttling Tor bulk users: Jansen et al. [143] addressed the poor performance of Tor network using bulk data transfers. Three dynamic throttling algorithms were proposed for reducing network congestion and latency. The guard relay capped the bandwidth capacity of nodes, so, only local relay information was used. Simulations showed that throttling reduces the web page latency and increases the anonymity of Tor network.


#### Tor Client Mobility

In this section, we study the research works focused on the mobility of Tor network with a particular emphasis on anonymity. Table 8 shows the research works in path selection track and shows that performance and anonymity have been the most frequently studied parameters. Details are presented in below paragraphs.

Using Bridge Relays: Doswell et al. [145] analyzed the performance of Tor for wireless devices roaming across multiple networks. Analysis showed that the speed of mobile wireless devices significantly affects the circuit building time and Tor's performance. Authors studied the use of bridge relays to provide persistent Tor connections for mobile devices.

New Architectural Designs: Andersson et al. [146] proposed several new architectural designs for a mobile Tor network. A trade-off between anonymity and performance was evaluated. Several criteria used in performance estimation included usability, availability, trust and practicality. The study concluded that the single Tor client option offers lowest degree of anonymity.


## Platforms for Tor Research

In this section, we study the platforms used to study Tor network. Our observations spanning over decades of anonymity research shows that all research works have studied the Tor network using three different techniques, (1) Experiment, (2), Simulations, and (3) Analysis. Figure  8 shows that 60% of the studies used in this paper conducted experiments. Only 27% of the studies conducted experiments. In the experiment section, majority studies developed their own testbed followed by experiments on cloud services and PlanetLab testbeds. In the simulations section, majority research works used extensive simulations to study Tor network. Finally, some studies analyze Tor network by collecting statistics and discussing the sociability and usability issues of Tor network. These three classification categories are elaborated in Figure 9 which shows the platforms used to study Tor network.


### Tor Experiments

Studies covering Tor experiments have focused over several areas including (1) private setup establishment, (2) PlanetLab experiments, (3) cloud services (4) OpenFlow networks and (5) Table 9 presents the clients, relays, servers, Tor services and Tor implementation used by various research works. Comparison shows that majority studies deployed their private testbeds with 1-2 clients and 1-2 servers. Several studies deployed limited number of relays for experiments. Number of clients were increased drastically in the Planet-Lab and cloud setup for Tor experiments. Moreover, traffic analysis was the most frequently studied topic. Majority research works used the default Tor setup without any modifications. Figure 10 shows the classifications of experiments on Tor. Analysis of figure shows that majority of studies deployed their own private testbeds.


#### Private Setup connected with Tor

Overlier and Syverson [46] performed experiments by setting up two nodes (one in Europe and other in US) running hidden services at two ends of the Tor network. Access to webpages and images was provided using these services. The client PC was setup both as a client and a middleman node, and all sampling takes place at this client node.

Andersson and Panchenko [146] performed experiments to verify the performance of their proposed mobile protocol. Mobile Tor was setup on a laptop connected to the Tor network. The content server hosting the files was placed at Karlstadt University. Experiments used OnionCoffee, which is a Java project developed under the PRIME project.

Panchenko et al. [99] performed experiments using a Pentium Dual Core 1GHz CPU with 2GB RAM as a client nodes. Two existing Tor implementations (default Tor and OnionCoffee) were used on the client nodes. The Internet connection had a 10Gbps bandwidth while the local backbone was 100Gbps. Actual Tor relays were used to analyze the performance.

Pries et al. [127] performed experiments by download- ing a 458kB file from a school web server. Command line utility wget was used as the downloading tool. wget's httpproxy and ftp-proxy were configured to download all files through Privoxy from the server. Tor release 0.1.1.26 was configured on the exit and entry nodes. Wagner et al. [59] implemented a novel architecture using Tor. Three machines were setup running Tor exit node, BIND (DNS server with tcpdump), and Apache webserver, respectively. All machines were synchronised by NTP. Connected to Tor network, WebProxy was implemented in Perl. iptables was used to re-route traffic from Tor exit node to Perl proxy server. All processing of web server logs and proxy logs was performed using Perl, sqlite and modified tcpick.

Chan-Tin et al. [57] setup a limited network for probing Tor network using client, burst server and probe machines. Entry and middle routers were chosen randomly while exit node was forced by choice. Four Tor relays were probed for the experiment and data of probes was collected after every 5secs. Five connections were setup by the client using multi-threading.

Pries et al. [20] setup client, server, entry malicious router and exit malicious router by setting up four devices. A TCP client application was built which sent and received TCP data. Test server used port 41 and received and displayed data on the screen. The client used tsocks to transport its TCP stream through onion proxy. The Tor configuration file was configured to select designated Tor entry and exit routers.

Herzberg et al. [84] implemented their proposed camouflaged browsing design over a test machine with an ADSL connection to the Internet with 1, 269kBps downlink and 103 kBps uplink bandwidth. Four different URLs were tested with 100 measurements and access time for browsers was recorded. wget was used to download web pages.

Bauer et al. [108] built an extensive experimental setup by establishing circuits for different kinds of applications with a number of malicious routers. The simulator generated 10, 000 circuits with 6 to 106 malicious routers. The path compromise rate for different applications was estimated by the selection of malicious routers.  Song et al. [73] used an Au3 script to capture Tor traffic. Six nodes located at distinct places (India, Romania, Luxemburg, New Zealand, Chile, and Russia) were deployed as exit nodes. Onion proxy running on a local PC was configured to use the deployed exit nodes. Traffic of all routers was captured to analysis.

Dhungel and Steiner [124] measured delay of Tor network by setting up two relays instead of three. Client, exit router and destination server were fixed while the entry router was selected from the list of available routers. To cope with varying network characteristics, the experiment was repeated for eight months with each duration of 40 minutes. All 1, 426 available routers were pinged five times for measurements.

Gros et al. [77] performed experiments by using the proposed Honeywall mechanism. All vulnerable clients using Tor were placed on one side of the Honeywall and Internet cloud was present on the other side of the Honeywall. All Tor clients had distinct private addresses while Honeywall had a single public IP address.

Wang et al. [58] conducted experiments in a partially controlled environment. The OP code was modified to use the designated entry and exit Tor routers. Entry and exit Tor nodes were configured to record the data relayed through them. Internet Explorer was used at the Tor client through Privoxy. The middle Tor router was selected through Tor router selection algorithms.

Loesing et al. [125] conducted experiments on Tor by configuring the Tor client to use fixed first / entry relay, which was being monitored continuously. Second and third Tor relays were chosen randomly by Tor's router selection algorithm. A single access attempt was performed by creating new Tor clients after every five minutes over a 72 hour duration.

Chen and Pasquale [95] analyzed the throughput by downloading a 100kB file through nearly 100 unique paths with 10 times repeated downloads over each path. 10 Tor clients were configured over PlanetLab testbed distributed around the globe. A file server containing 100kB file was hosted in the US using thttpd. cURL was used to conduct downloads. Python was used to write measurement scripts using the TorCtl library for Tor control port. Tor circuits were configured to be replaced after every 30 minutes instead of 10 minutes so that no middle replacement takes place.

Panchenko et al. [97] performed experiments in the current Tor network with the estimation of delay and throughput. In first experiment, onion routers are fixed but links connecting the circuit are variable. 2, 000 sets were built with random onion routers. In the second experiment, ICMP Ping was used to measure the delay between send-ing a SYN and receiving a SYN-ACK packet. Each ping was iterated 20 times to calculate the mean value.

Houmansadr et al. [53] conducted a deep experimental investigation on the Tor network. Application layer softwares (Skype, CensorSpoofer) were executed in Virtu-alBox virtual machines (VMs) on a Funtoo Linux machine. Various VMs were connected through virtual distributed Ethernet (VDE). Authors built their own plugin for VDE which could drop packets at variable rates and also modify packet contents. Various VDE switches were connected to the central switch which provides DHCP connectivity to the Internet.

Li et al. [98] tested their proposed tunable mechanism of Tor (TMT) over the real Tor network. Two virtual private servers (VPSes), acting as client and server, were configured on Linode. The client was configured with the TMT enhancement while the server hosted a web page. Time to load the file, number of attempts and number of failure attempts were measured to estimate the performance of TMT.

Chakravarti et al. [54] setup their own client, server and probing host machine at three distinct locations inside US. 100MB file was placed at the web server which gave sufficient downloading time to the client. Linux traffic controller was used to shape the client-server bandwidth. 26 distinct Tor circuits were created and probed through different locations and compromised links were detected.

The authors created and monitored six Tor relay nodes (placed in US, Germany, France, Japan, Taiwan) advertising 100kB available bandwidth for 23 days. On average 20GB of data is provided by each server on every day. Data was collected at entry and exit relays.

Bai et al. [50] setup eight PCs with one PC running Tor and one PC running java anonymous proxy (JAP). Dummy traffic was generated from the other six PCs. Traffic was captured through ethereal. Winsock Packet Editor was used to record packets generated by a specific application. Duration of the test was about 120mins with five repetitions.

Barker et al. [51] collected Tor network traces by developing a complete Tor setup. Firefox running on Ubuntu was used on all machines. Using the Selenium browser testing framework, 170 simulations were executed by accessing 30 websites. Three directory servers with 15 relays were configured to be used for experiments. Regular HTTPs traffic and HTTP and HTTPs traffic through private Tor network were collected.

Marks et al. [81] conducted a simple experiment using three PCs running Linux kernel (2.6.26 and CUBIC TCP). All three machines were connected via an Ether-net switch. All Ethernet interfaces were configured to be 10Mbps full-duplex links. The first and last two devices setup TCP connections. First device sent data to the second for 250secs while the second retransmitted after 50secs delay for a duration of 250secs.

Jin and Wang [75] conducted extensive experiments by monitoring both anonymous traffic and Tor traffic during two experiments. In the first experiment, an Apache webserver on a Dell PC using Redhat Enterprise 4 Linux was configured. A watermark encoder was installed on the Apache proxy. A Dell Precision 390 was configured as a NAT router to route traffic between client and the anonymous server. In the second experiment, an SSH server and watermark encoder were installed on one machine acting as server. SSH client and watermark decoder were installed on another machine. Three random characters were sent every second from one machine to the other through Tor. Entry and exit relays were fixed.

Tang and Goldberg [104] setup their own node (acting as the middle node). Entry and exit nodes were selected from the Tor nodes of the directory server. Authors avoided the use of PlanetLab testbed because majority nodes were providing only 100KB/s. Webfetch was used to download the target file (87KB) from author's web server. Connecting circuits and load was varied to verify the proposed path selection strategy.

Alsabah et al. [52] performed real world experiments by collecting offline data of 200 circuits from three distinct application traces. All three applications (BitTorrent client, web browsing client and stream client) were setup on the same machine which was configured to use a specified Tor node as the entry node. All 200 circuits included browsing (122), BitTorrent (49) and streaming circuits (28). All applications collected 24 hours of data over a 6 week period with periodic intervals.

Moghaddam et al. [139] implemented their proposed SkypeMorph technique on Linux using C and C++ with boost libraries. Authors collected traces of Skype data set for modeling using multiple machines. The proposed SkypeMorph scheme was tested by downloading multiple files with and without it.

Evans et al. [63] performed experiments on the real Tor network for their proposed congestion attack. The victim user (to be breached) was using Javascript on her browser. Entry node was fixed but the other two Tor relay nodes were selected at random (by Tor's router selection algorithm).

Wang et al. [105] measured the network delays during congestion by collecting delay readings of all Tor routers for 72 hours in August 2011. At the next stage, authors collected RTT measurements of the modified and unmodified Tor client to setup 255 circuits. In all experiments, client machines were modified to incorporate the proposed algorithm and measure the delay.

Ehlert [126] measured the performance of I2P and Tor network.

A modem provided a data rate of 56kb/s downstream and 44kb/s upstream. For EDGE, data rate was around 230kb/s. The broadband network provided 100Mb/s.

McCoy et al. [118] setup their router connected to 1Gb/s network link with a rank of top 5% Tor routers and flagged as Running. At most 20bytes were logged to avoid information breaching laws. Setup was configured for both experiments separately covering (1) exit router and (2) non-exit router. Entrance and middle router traffic was logged for 15 days comprising of time stamp, previous hop's IP, TCP port, next hop's IP and circuit identifier. For exit traffic logging, tcpdump was used over the router which relayed 709GB of traffic and only the first 150bytes of packet were logged. Ethereal was used for protocol analysis.

Chakravarty et al. [68] transmitted decoy traffic over a custom client supporting IMAP and SMTP protocols. The client was implemented using Perl and service protocol emulation was provided by Net::IMAPClient and Net::SMTP. The client hosted on Intel Xeon CPU running Ubuntu Server Linux v8.04.

Snader and Borisov [106] performed experiments on Tor by downloading 1MB files over HTTP connections through various exit routers.

#### PlanetLab Experiments

Akhoondi et al. [94] performed experiments in the real Tor network by modifying the Tor Client with their proposed LASTor protocol. LASTor is a Java application controlling the Tor client through Control Port. 50 PlanetLab nodes running LASTor were used as Tor clients to access top 200 websites. Both latency and anonymization were tested by collecting the traces of data set at the client nodes.

Murdoch and Danezis [70] performed experiments on the Tor network by setting up a probe PC. A modified version of Tor was used in the probe PC to choose routes of length one. A TCP client was also established at the node which connects to the SOCKS interface of Tor using socat. Original Tor relays were used with a corrupt destination Tor server recording the traffic traces. The probe server ran at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory while victim and corrupt server were run on PlanetLab nodes. Data from 13 probing Tor nodes was collected and analyzed in GNU R.

Bauer et al. [64] performed experiments over Planet-Lab testbed by setting up two independent node networks comprising of 40 and 60 nodes, respectively. Two and six malicious nodes were added in the 40 node network while three and six malicious nodes were added in the 60 node network. Traffic was generated by six machines running 60 and 90 clients (requesting files of less than 10MB size using HTTP protocol) in the 40 and 60 node network, respectively. To avoid flooding of network requests, clients sleep in the 0 − 60sec interval for random periods after every random number of web requests.

Data from the probe server was sent in bursts after every 0.2secs while corrupt server sends data after every 10 − 15secs.


#### ExperimenTor

Bauer et al. [123] built a toolkit for emulation of Tor network named by ExperimenTor. The ModelNet network emulation platform has been used as the baseline approach. Scalability is one of the issues in Experimen-Tor, owing to high resource consumption for large number of nodes.

For performance analysis, small and large files were downloaded starting from 300KB. In the following stage, web and SSH traffic were simulated.


#### Shadow Simulator

Geddes et al. [67] used the Shadow simulator with real Tor code on a simulated network. The simulated network consisted of 160 exit relays, 240 non-exit relays, 2375 web clients, 125 bulk clients, 150 small and medium Torperf clients and 400 HTTP servers. Experiments consisted of downloads of a 320KB file from random servers after random delays (1 − 60secs). Bulk clients downloaded 5MB file without any wait time. For TorPerf clients, 50KB, 1MB and 5MB files were downloaded after every ten minutes.

Jansen et al. [122] performed simulations over Shadow with a setup of 200 HTTP servers, 950 Tor web clients, 50 Tor bulk clients and 50 Tor relays. Bulk clients downloaded 5MB file while web clients downloaded 5KB page. Latency of network was borrowed from the latency of Plan-etLab nodes. Performance was estimated by varying the load from 25 (light) to 50 (medium) to high (100) bulk users.


#### ModelNet

AlSabah et al. [142] used the ModelNet network emulation platform along with practical traffic models for performance evaluations. For small-scale experiments, 200 downloads are made of the 300KB and 5MB files by two clients in two separate experiments. For large scale experiment, 20 Tor routers are deployed with real Tor networks' bandwidth. Each link has 80ms RTT delay. Ten clients download 1-5MB file and 190 clients download 100-500KB file.


### Tor's Analysis

A number of studies limited their research works to the analysis of current Tor network instead of simulations and experiments of Tor. Analysis occurs in the subfields of usability of Tor, path selection mechanism, empirical analysis and development of theoretical model. In below lines, we present the individual studies comprising of Tor's analysis.


#### Analytical Model

Several studies develop analytical model for analysis of Tor network. These studies are presented in following lines.

Anti-misbehaviour Policy Analysis: Liu and Wang [128] proposed anti-misbehavior policies and analyzed it with the original Tor architecture. No simulations or experiments were conducted.

Security Analysis: Goldberg [134] built an analytical model for analyzing the security of Tor's authentication protocol. Authors focused on analytical evaluations rather than simulations or experiments.

Botnet Abuse Analysis: Hopper [132] analyzed the various possibilities for avoiding botnet abuse in the Tor network. Majority schemes were discussed only, and a few schemes were tested to verify the performance. Several schemes were analyzed analytically.

Anonymity Model: Xin et al. [79] developed a theoretical model to increase the anonymity of the Tor network. They aimed to implement the proposed system on Planet-Lab testbed, in future.


#### Empirical Analysis

A number of studies performed empirical analysis of Tor network without performing simulations or experiments. In following lines, we present the findings of these studies.

Statistical Analysis: Wang et al. [129] performed empirical analysis and used data available from "Tor Metric Portal" for analysis. There were no simulations or experiments performed in the research. In another study, Elices et al. [47] analyzed their attack on Tor using empirical analysis. Access logs from seven web servers were obtained to analyze user request pattern. Moreover, Abbott et al. [62] conducted a statistical evaluation by measuring the probabilities of breaching Tor using the proposed scheme.

Robustness Analysis: Barthe et al. [115] analyzed the robustness of the Tor network and proposed enhancements in the current network. Cryptographic enhancements were evaluated without any simulation or experimental validations.

Path Selection Protocol: Liu and Wang [101] presented an improved circuit building protocol with no simulations or experiments. Proposed algorithm was analyzed considering various aspects. In another study, Liu and Wang [100] presented random walk based algorithm for Tor circuit construction. Anonymity and performance were the key metrics evaluated in their study. However, the scope of this study did not cover simulations or experimental evaluations.


#### Usability Analysis

Usability analysis of Tor has not been carried out by a lot of studies. However, some studies referring to usability analysis are summarized in below lines.

Clark et al. [113] conducted a usability analysis by installing various components of Tor including Vidalia, Privoxy, Torbutton and Foxyproxy on a standard machine. In another study, Abou-Tair et al. [112] presented the usability analysis of the various anonymous service applications including Tor. Various anonymity tools were installed on a machine and usability, ease of installation and use was analyzed.


## Discussion

In this section, we present the discussion and our findings of Tor network. In the first part, we present the performance metrics used to evaluate the Tor network in different research works. In the second part, we present our findings of Tor research works referred in this study. In the last part, we show our findings for open research areas in the field of Tor network which may be used for future research works.


### Tor Performance Metrics

Analyzing the performance metrics is a crucial task for future research, analysis, simulations and experiments in the Tor network. Table 10 presents the performance metrics of Tor used in various studies. No clear patterns were observed, so, authors described the metrics used in individual studies. A brief overview of the table shows that throughput (bandwidth) and latency are the most frequently used metrics. However, every research formalized its own performance metric based upon the requirement of the experiment.


### Survey Findings

In this section, we summarize our findings for the onion router by comparing all studies with a deep focus over the key concepts and ideas used in different research works. We divide our research evaluations in three subcategories considering (1) research areas, (2) research platforms, and (3) performance metrics.


#### Research Areas

The majority of Tor research (nearly 55%) covering anonymity is focused over deanonymization of Tor network. Around 20% studies are related to the path selection mechanism. Only 25% research studies are on performance analysis and improvement mechanism of Tor network. According to Dingledine (the co-founder of Tor project), majority research works focus their attention on the breaching Tor.

Deanonymization:

In the deanonymization track, 35% of the studies design deanonymization attacks for Tor while 21% deanonymize Tor using traffic analysis. 16% focus on improvements to bypass deanonymization while 14% study fingerprinting mechanisms to identify Tor traffic on the Internet. Only 9% identify hidden services while 2% focus on anonymity mechanisms without using Tor.

All deanonymization related Tor studies have exploited its inherent weaknesses. Compromised relays are the most exploited weaknesses followed by traffic interception and protocol messages. Very few studies focus on the compromised autonomous systems, browsers, servers, decoy traffic, and flag cheating.

Path Selection:

In the path selection track, 87% of the studies focus on the design of new path selection algorithms and 13% research works analyze currently developed algorithms.

Our analysis shows that anonymity and performance (bandwidth and latency) are the most important parameters used in the design and analysis of path selection algorithms. Relays have been incorporated in the design of path selection algorithms covering both location and capacity of relays. Other parameters include autonomous systems, hops, multi-path mechanism and load.

Performance Analysis and Architectural Improvements:

In the performance analysis and improvement track, 32% of the research works cover analysis and 27% of studies focus on performance improvement mechanisms. 29% of the studies provide general analysis of Tor covering usability and sociability issues. 10% of the research works focus on modeling of the Tor network while 2% address client mobility.

Analysis of various research studies show that performance (latency and bandwidth), relay selection, and anonymity are the most used parameters. Other studies also pay attention to queues, QoS, protocol messages and traffic shaping.


#### Research Platforms

An interesting feature revealed in analysis is the fact that 60% of the research works were conducted by performing real-world experiments on the Tor network. Although special measures were taken to protect the identity of users but majority research works failed to analyze legal or ethical requirements of capturing user data and performing experiments by developing attacks in real network. Only 27% of studies developed their own simulator and 13% conducted analysis without experiments or simulations.

Experiments: Our survey shows that 86% of the research works developed their own testbed for experiments. The majority of studies deployed 1-2 clients with 1-3 servers for experiments. Research works covering relays used 1-3 relays. However, some research works increased the number of relays by using virtual machines and PlanetLab. A limited number of studies used cloud-based setups.

Simulations: Interestingly, 75% of the research works developed their own simulator without any common parameters used for Tor network. ns-3, OMNET, C and Java were used for the development of custom simulators. 13% of the research works used ExperimenTor. Our research shows that Ex-perimenTor is the most common toolkit used by majority of the research. 8% and 3% of the studies used Shadow simulator and ModelNet, respectively.


#### Performance Metrics

We considered the performance metrics used in various works. Analysis shows that no hard and fast rule exists for use of performance metrics. Every study developed its own metrics to measure performance, anonymity and QoS. Moreover, no baseline techniques exist for the comparison of results.


### Open Research Areas

Our survey shows that majority of the research works are concentrated in a few domains. However, a number of major challenges exist owing to the peer-to-peer nature of Tor. A number of key areas have also been identified by the Tor team. We identified the following areas which require further research. 


## Data Estimation: Estimation of key network statis-

tics is the most critical task in the Tor network because it is a peer-to-peer network. No one can see the entire traffic so it is not possible to estimate the size of Tor network. Some of the statistics requiring attention are as follows:

• Number of clients in the network: Peer-to-peer networks make it impossible to estimate the total traffic statistics because no user can see the complete traffic. • Capabilities of relays: There is limited information available about the relays which are the most crucial parameters in path selection. Incorporation of relay capabilities into anonymity of Tor and performance model is a key research area as done in a number of studies. • Performance of the network: Estimation of network performance at any given time is a crucial task. Owing to the P2P nature, only health of relays is known to the Tor administration. How is the network performing at any given instant? is still a crucial task. • Number of clients connecting via bridges: Tor authorities provide secret relay addresses to clients who can't access Tor due to blockage of relays in their location. However, very little is known about the quantity of clients connecting through bridges and their traffic statistics. • Exit network traffic: Significant research is required about the exit network traffic. All clients pass their data through relays and very little is known about the statistics of traffic exiting exit relays. 2. Analysis: Deep analysis of the current Tor network is required. Analysis may be based upon an extension of previous research into path length, anonymity, latency, etc. Analysis of the optimal performance parameters is required. 3. Measurement and Attack tools: Development of novel attack methodologies to identify the shortcomings of the current Tor network. Tor has no automatic mechanism to identify anomalies and assess the health of the network. Attack tools should be developed which should prevent attacks occurring from compromised relays and servers. 


## Conclusion

This paper deals with the survey, classification, quantification and comparative analysis of various research works covering Tor network. To the author's best knowledge, no other survey/research has performed such a deep and thorough analysis of Tor studies. Our study shows that Tor research areas can be broadly classified into (1) deanonymization, (2) path selection, (3) analysis and performance improvements. More than half studies carried out address 'deanonymization' with major subdivisions into deanonymization 'attacks' and 'traffic analysis' attacks. In the 'path selection' area, more than 85% of the studies have focused on the development of new algorithms. In the 'analysis and performance improvement' area, the majority of studies are a mixed bag, followed by analysis, followed by performance improvement studies. Our analysis of Tor platforms shows that 60% of studies performed experiments while 27% performed simulations. Among experiments, 86% of the studies deployed private testbeds. Among simulations, 75% developed their own simulators. Analysis of parameters (used in various studies) shows that their is no little consistency across various studies. However, a majority of the studies used variations of throughput and latency for performance analysis.

Comprised relays are vulnerable to botnet based attacks comprising of DDOS attacks, fingerprinting attacks etc. Despite large amount of research in botnet attacks, it is still open to research which would make Tor a more stable and secure network. 4. Defenses against Attacks: Develop novel defense methodologies to counter attacks on the Tor network. Although majority research works have focused on the development of novel attack methodologies, very little is known about viable counter-measures. Our survey shows that relays are mostly vulnerable because they can be deployed by any eavesdropper. Countermeasures against congestion attacks, latency measuring attacks, throughput measuring attacks, etc. can help in the improvement of Tor.
This paper has 146 references, some of the references are to tools rather than research works; in all, we are considering a research corpus of 120 references.
