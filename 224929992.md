Eucalyptus is a plant that has a very beneficial value to the environment such as can reduce the risk of forest fires, be efficient in water use, nature became more natural, restore land degradation or unproductive land, and the growth of these plants has a sustainable potential for biodiversity. Therefore, the need to replant eucalyptus in order to create a sustainable process for the environment to offers opportunities for wealth and prosperity, while also providing solutions for efficient ways to combat climate change. The purpose of this literature review is to provide information to the public about the benefits of plants that actually have extraordinary functions and characteristics but often get criticism from the community because of community disregard about the benefits It expects in the future eucalyptus can generate more wealth and benefits to the environment. Also, this review literature focuses on eucalyptus plants which provide significant benefits in various sectors, both for the environment and the industrial sector.

## Introduction

The growth process of tree plantations around the world is very fast, it is caused by soil fertility and soil carbon storage [1]. So an important challenge that must be faced in the twenty-first century is the system of replanting sustainable eucalyptus forests to meet the demand for wood production and maintain links with biodiversity [2]. In the coming decades, it is estimated that global eucalyptus demand from plantations will increase. Demand for wood is used for the production of paper and pulp wood, but it can also be used for the production of high-quality multipurpose wood [3] Initially, eucalyptus plants originated from Tasmania, Australia, and other Indo-Malaysia islands, which numbered around 700 plant species. Eucalyptus plants have great value for the environment, the industrial sector uses 37 of the temporary species for commercial purposes only as many as 15 of the existing species. Eucalyptus are derived from Greek eu (wells) and kalyptus (closed) which can be given protection by an operculum [4].

The development of eucalyptus was more than 200 years ago in Europe, starting from the Iberian Peninsula to Portugal in 1829. Mid-19 th century as a result of the flow of migration from Australia and New Zealand this plant was introduced in the United States. Eucalyptus plants are widespread throughout the world because they have a broad ecological level and ability to adapt to the global forest surface area, only about 0.53% of the percentage owned by eucalyptus plants is found in more than 90 countries in the tropics and sub-tropics [4]. 


## 5)

Forests planted with eucalyptus create new natural space and produce biodiversity; 6) Eucalyptus forests can act like natural forests because of their function, even though these plants are not natural forests; 7) Eucalyptus can increase soil fertility; 8) Eucalyptus can restore land degradation or unproductive land; 9) Eucalyptus leaves and stems can act as a nutrient and not acidic for the soil. B. Benefits in the industrial sector 1) Planting these plants creates employment and wealth in rural areas because using land owned by the community 2) To produce pulp and renewable energy, eucalyptus plants are the right plants to use because they have excellent characteristics 3) Eucalyptus has a quality at a lower cost in making and printing tissue paper. 4) Around the eucalyptus plantations can also be used for many industrial and social purposes raising livestock and hunting 5) There are opportunities for economic and social development in the form of the energy potential offered by eucalyptus biomass

### Review

Based on the description in Table 3, it can be concluded that the replanting of native eucalyptus species in the forest is strongly recommended. Many studies have been conducted on eucalyptus, one of which is a study conducted in South China that focuses on 16 years old eucalyptus to assess the effects of replanting eucalyptus trees. While on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia and, Sabah, Malaysia, changes were also made to the plants that originally grew Acacia mangium to be converted into eucalyptus. In point 3 also explained the importance of sustainable planting as a result of land degradation so as not to become a global problem in the 21 st century due to its negative impact on the environment, agronomic productivity, and its effect on food security and quality of human life.


## Conclusion

The conclusions that can be drawn after a literature review are as follows: a. Eucalyptus was first discovered in Australia, but in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in Galicia and in the Cantabria region, it has ideal conditions especially in the soil and climate for the development of these plants so as to produce higher sustainability productivity. b. There are about 700 species of eucalyptus, all of which have good value for the environment, but the industrial sector uses 37 of these species while only 15 are used for commercial purposes.

Productive eucalyptus forestsFor more than 60 years ENCE has conducted various studies on eucalyptus plants. Every year thousands of hectares of forest have been created by ENCE, always developing new research techniques to improve the genetic makeup of eucalyptus plants and focus on species productivity to achieve eucalyptus plants with very diverse conditions and have uses to protect nature and the environment. In addition, the ENCE industrial sector has produced more than 4000 stable jobs that are beneficial to the surrounding area. Because of the many benefits, we can get from replanting eucalyptus plants, this literature review is carried out. Eucalyptus plants act as oxygen storage tanks because of the mass effect in the plants;3) Eucalyptus plants can improve the amount of carbon CO2 is greater because of rapid renewal and growth every 10 or 15 years; 4) Eucalyptus is more efficient in water consumption than other species;2

c. Even though only 13 million hectares have productivity and are attractive from an industry 
perspective, eucalyptus plants are now present in more than 90 countries and are spread out over 
more than 22 million hectares worldwide. 
d. Replanting eucalyptus plants has been proven to have so many characteristics and benefits from 
both the environmental and industrial sectors. These benefits have been explained in detail in this 
review literature. Therefore, it is very necessary to replant the eucalyptus plants in order to create a 
process of sustainability into the future.
