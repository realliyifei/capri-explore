Background: While controlling the outbreak of communicable diseases (CDs) remained a priority, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are placing an unavoidable burden on the health and social security system. India, a developing nation in South Asia, has seen an unprecedented economic growth in the past few years; however, it struggled to ght the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Therefore, this study aimed at examining the burden of CDs and NCDs among elderly in India.Methods: Data from Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI Wave-I, 2017-18)  were drawn to conduct this study. Response variables were the occurrence of CDs and NCDs. The bi-variate and binary logistic regression were used to predict the association between communicable and non-communicable diseases by various socio-demographic and health parameters. Furthermore, to understand the inequalities of communicable and non-communicable diseases in urban and rural areas, the Fairlie decomposition technique was used to predict the contribution toward rural-urban inequalities in CDs and NCDs.Results: Prevalence of communicable diseases was higher among uneducated elderly than those with higher education (31.9% vs. 17.3%); however, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases was higher among those with higher education (67.4% vs. 47.1%) than uneducated elderly. The odds of NCDs were higher among female elderly (OR=1.13; C.I. = 1-1.27) than their male counterparts. Similarly, the odds of CDs were lower among urban elderly (OR=0.70; C.I. = 0.62-0.81) than rural elderly, and odds of NCDs were higher among urban elderly (OR=1.85; C.I. = 1.62-2.10) than their rural counterparts. Results found that education (50%) contributes nearly half of the rural-urban inequality in the prevalence of CDs among the elderly. Education status and current working status were the two signi cant predictors of widening rural-urban inequality in the prevalence of NCDs among the elderly.Conclusion: The burden of both CD and NCD among the elderly population requires immediate intervention. The needs of men and women and urban and rural elderly must be addressed through appropriate effort. In a developing country like India, preventive measures, rather than curative measures of communicable diseases, will be cost-effective and helpful.BackgroundAlthough South-Asian countries are still young regarding their demographic pro le, the population in South-Asian countries has also started to age [1]. The ever-increasing aged population in South Asian countries leads to many healthcare-related challenges [1]. While controlling the outbreak of communicable diseases remained a priority, non-communicable diseases are placing an unavoidable burden on the health system [1]. India, a developing nation in South Asia, has seen an unprecedented economic growth in the past few years; however, it struggled to ght the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases [1]. India, with more than 8 percent of its population being more than 60 + years [2][3][4], has acquired the level of an ageing nation with the growth of older Indian population in absolute number comparatively faster than other regions of the world[5]. A rising proportion of elderly in India has infused notable challenges to the healthcare system, which is already undeveloped [6]. With a slighter decline in Communicable Diseases (CD) and a steeper increase in Noncommunicable disease (NCD), India is currently undergoing the double burden of CDs and NCDs[7].Communicable diseases (CD) were the prime cause of death worldwide for a very long time[8]. However, with the advent of vaccinations, antibiotics, and improvements in living conditions, non-communicable diseases (NCD) rose[8]. At rst, NCD was the burden for healthcare systems in developed countries only as NCD were termed as diseases of the rich [8]. However, off lately, NCD appeared to be sweeping the entire globe, an increasing trend in developing countries[8]. India is also experiencing an increasing burden of NCD among the elderly [9, 10]. Despite an increasing burden of NCD, India still does not have su ciently detailed data on NCDs for research and policy purposes[9]. On one side, NCDs are increasing among the elderly in India; however, on the other side, CDs are also a cause of concern among the elderly in India[7]. The projected increase in the elderly population in India [11] would bring several repercussions as far as the burden of CDs, and NCDs is concerned[7]. Given the limited literature examining CD and NCD among elderly in South Asian countries, there is a need to examine the burden of CD and NCD in India. Therefore, this study aimed at examining the burden of CDs and NCDs among elderly in India. This study explored prevalence and determinants of CDs and NCDs among elderly in India along with examining the urban-rural inequalities in the prevalence of CDs and NCDs among elderly in India.Institute on Aging (NIA), and the United Nations Population Fund, India (UNFPA). The survey included the older adults (men and women) age 45 years and above across all the states (exclude Sikkim) and union territories in India. The LASI wave-I covers comprehensive aspects of chronic health conditions, functional and mental health, healthcare utilization, family and social networks, work and employment and life expectations.The LASI has utilized a multistage strati ed area probability sampling design to reach out a representative sample. In addition, the three stage sampling design used for rural areas while four-stage sampling design used for urban areas. Further, the rst stage engaged to selection of primary sampling units (PSUs) i.e. Tehsils and Talukas. The second stage considered the selection of villages in rural areas and wards in urban areas. In the third stage, household were selected from pre-selected villages in rural areas where census enumeration blocks (CEBs) were selected in urban areas. In additional and nal stage of sampling in urban areas, the process of selection of household was made through selected CEBs. substantial proportion of the elderly population in India is facing the burden of CD and the long-neglected NCD. From the beginning of the 21st century, the NCDs has been recognized as an emerging global health challenge[15], and also it has already started sweeping extensively all over the world with an exceedingly increasing trend in developing countries[8,15,16]. However, India does not recognize it as an important public health challenge till the second decade of this millennium [17]. In the National Health Policy 2002, the NCDs were not given a signi cant position among public health issue, but later in Draft National Health policy 2015, the chronic disease with non-communicable nature drew special attention [17].This paper envisages the prevalence of both types of diseases among the elder population and found that more than half of the elderly population suffers from NCD, and nearly one-third suffers from CD. A study based on wave one of the world Health organization's study on global ageing and adult health also found the same pattern of NCD's prevalence and reported that 50% of total aged population is suffering from at least one type of chronic non-communicable disease [18]. Furthermore, in a report released by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India (GOI), "India: Health of the Nation's States" reveal that NCDs' contribution to total disease burden-'disability-adjusted life years' (DALYs) increased from 30% in 1990 to 55% in 2016, as well as the proportion of fatalities owing to NCDs (in total deaths) increased from 37% in 1990 to 61 percent in 2016. This demonstrates a rapid epidemiological shift in illness burden to NCDs.Also, the prevalence of these diseases varies with the socio-economic and bio-demographical backgrounds of the elderly. The percentage of elderly suffering from NCD is higher among those who are highly educated, richest, living in the urban area, taking alcohol, having severe ADL and IADL, whereas CD is common among the elderly those who are uneducated and lower educated, living in rural areas, poorer, taking tobacco, having severe ADL and IADL. The CD and NCD are also found to be higher among those elderly who are living alone. The living arrangements of the older population have a signi cant impact on their health. The percentage of elders with CDs and NCDs is higher among those who are living alone. The fertility decline has a direct association with the declining co-residence of the elders[19], and as a consequence, the elderly are not getting the care that is required for their better health status.The study also presents the state-wise variation in CDs and NCDs among the elderly. The NCDs are found to be more common in south Indian states, and UTs and Kerala have exceptionally highest percentage of elderly with NCDs across all states of India. The high burden of NCD in Kerala among the elderly is primarily due to the increase in the proportion of their population and the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle[20]. The burdens of CDs are found to be higher in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. The geographical pattern of CDs and NCDs manifests the north-south divide in the burden of these diseases. The less-developed north India with a lower percentage of urbanization has more burden of CDs, whereas the more developed southern India has a higher percentage of the urban population, has a greater burden of NCDs. As reported by the previous literature, the urban population has a greater burden of NCD and related risk[21]. Furthermore, region-wise variation in the diseases could be attributed to the region-speci c food habits and harmful dietary practices, tobacco consumption, and sedentary habits[22].The present study also shows the proportion of CDs and NCDs among the elderly in India. Among CDs, diarrhea, Malaria and Typhoid have the highest proportion, and Chikungunya, tuberculosis, and dengue have the lowest proportion. The most common NCDs are hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, and chronic lung diseases. The hearth diseases and cancer have a comparatively lower prevalence than above-mentioned NCDs, but they are found to be most

The LASI featured with 72, 250 individuals, including 31, 434 age 60 years and above and 6,749 individuals age 75 years and above. However, this study taken up 60 years and above population.


## The Double Burden Of Communicable And Non-communicable Diseases

Double burden of disease refers to the situation where an individual suffers from both non-communicable and infectious diseases. A study classi ed the burden of diseases in three broad clusters: communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injuries [7]. Our study examines the responses of communicable and non-communicable diseases only. Following diseases were included as communicable disease: Jaundice/ Hepatitis, Tuberculosis (TB), Malaria, Diarrhoea/gastroenteritis, Typhoid, Urinary Tract Infection, Chikungunya and Dengue. Within non-communicable diseases, following conditions were included: Hypertension or high blood pressure, diabetes or high blood sugar, Cancer or a malignant tumour, Chronic lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/Chronic bronchitis or other chronic lung problems, Chronic heart diseases such as Coronary heart disease (heart attack or Myocardial Infarction), congestive heart failure, or other chronic heart problems, Stroke, Arthritis or rheumatism, Osteoporosis or other bone/joint diseases, Any neurological, or psychiatric problems such as depression, Alzheimer's/Dementia, unipolar/bipolar disorders, convulsions, Parkinson's, etc. and High cholesterol. All communicable and non-communicable diseases are diagnosed by the health professional.


## Study Variables


## Response variable

The response variables for this study are communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases. Communicable diseases are diagnosed by health professionals and asked as "In the past 2 years, have you had any of the following diseases?" and responses have been recorded in 'yes' and 'no.' Similarly, non-communicable diseases are also diagnosed by health professionals and asked in the form of 'yes' and 'no.'


## Predictors

The predictors for this study are considered as sex (male and female); age (60-69 and 70 years and above); marital status (currently married, never married, Divorced/Separated/Deserted/Widowhood), education (No education, below primary, primary, secondary, and higher); living arrangements (living alone, with spouse and with others); place of residence (rural and urban); currently working (yes and no); wealth index (poorest, poorer, middle, richer and richest); selfrated health (poor and good; physical activity (yes and no); tobacco use (no and yes); alcohol use (yes and no); ADL disability (severe, moderate and no disability), and IADL disability (severe, moderate and no disability). Furthermore, ADL and IADL disability constructed from ve (bathing, dressing, mobility, feeding, and toileting) and seven (preparing a hot meal (cooking and serving), shopping for groceries, making telephone calls, taking medications, doing work around the house or garden, managing money, such as paying bills and keeping track of expenses and getting around or nding an address in an unfamiliar place) activities. Both the ADL and IADL disability was categorized into the three categories as "severe," "moderate," and "no disability" based on the scale given in previous studies [13,14].


## Statistical Measures

The analyses were carried out with statistical software STATA version 16th. The bi-variate technique was used to understand the prevalence of communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases by socio-demographic and health parameters and across the states in India. Further, binary logistic regression was used to predict the association between communicable and non-communicable diseases and socio-demographic and health parameters. The equation for binary logistic regression is given below, In the above regression equation, is the probability of being perceived as communicable or non-communicable diseases, , … are the predictors, is the intercept and , … are the coe cients.

Furthermore, to understand the inequalities of communicable and non-communicable diseases in urban and rural areas, the Fairlie decomposition technique was used to predict the contribution toward rural-urban inequalities in CDs and NCDs. The Fairlie technique was rst initiated by Fairlie in 1999 which used to estimate from a logit or probit model. The equation for Fairlie decomposition can be written as, Where N U and N R is the sample size for urban and rural respectively, and are the average probability of a binary outcome of interest for group urban and rural, F is the cumulative distribution function from the logistic distribution, distribution, and are the set of the average value of the independent variable and and are the coe cient estimates for the urban and rural, respectively. Figure 1 depicts the prevalence of CDs among the elderly in India. Almost 15 percent of the elderly reported Diarrhoea and another 8.6 percent reported Malaria. Almost 5.5 percent of the elderly reported Typhoid. Figure 2 depicts the prevalence of NCDs among the elderly in India. Almost one-third of the elderly reported hypertension (32.8%), and another one-fth (19.7%) reported Arthritis. In addition, nearly 14.3 percent reported Diabetes, and 8.5 percent reported chronic lung diseases. Table 1 depicts the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases among the elderly by various socioeconomic and health characteristics of the elderly. Results found that more elderly females reported communicable (26.8% vs. 26.2%) and non-communicable diseases (55.6% vs. 50.3%) than their male counterparts. Prevalence of communicable diseases was higher among uneducated elderly than those with higher education (29.8% vs. 16.6%); however, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases was higher among those with higher education (67.4% vs. 47.1%) than uneducated elderly. Those who reported good self-rated health had a lower prevalence of communicable (24.9% vs. 36.9%) and non-communicable diseases (50% vs. 70.4%) than those who reported poor self-rated health. Similarly, communicable and non-communicable diseases were higher among those who had severe ADL and IADL disabilities.    Table 3  were lower among those with good self-rated health than those with poor self-rated health. The odds of NCDs (OR = 1.16; C.I. = 1.03-1.29) were higher among the elderly with no physical activity than their counterparts. The odds of NCDs were lower among the elderly who had no ADL (OR = 0.52; C.I. = 0.35-0.78) than those who had severe ADL limitations.  Table 4 depicts the rural-urban inequality in the prevalence of CDs among the elderly by various characteristics. Results found that education (50%)


## Results

contributes nearly half of the rural-urban inequality in the prevalence of CDs among the elderly. Self-rated health was another signi cant predictor that explained nearly one-sixth (16.01%) of the rural-urban inequality in the prevalence of CDs among the elderly in India. ***p < 0.001; **p < 0.05; *p < 0.10 Table 5 depicts the rural-urban inequality in the prevalence of NCDs among the elderly by various characteristics. Education status and current working status were the two signi cant predictors of widening rural-urban inequality in the prevalence of NCDs among the elderly. On the other hand, wealth index, Self-rated health, and IADL disability were the three factors narrowing down the rural-urban inequality in the prevalence of NCDs among the elderly in India. 


## Discussion

Our study attempts to assess the prevalence of CDs and NCDs among the elderly and its associated factors. The nding of this study shows that a fatal across countries. Globally, the heart diseases (cardiovascular diseases) has the highest fatality rate among all NCDs and account for nearly 17.9 million death annually which is followed by death because of cancers (9.3 million), chronic lung diseases (4.1 million), and diabetes (1.5 million) [23]. In India, these four NCDs, including stroke, account for nearly 5.8 million deaths annually [15,24]. On the other hand, with these NCDs, the CDs continue to pose a signi cant challenge to India's elderly life.

Corroborating with previous ndings [25,26], the study noted a higher likelihood of NCDs among the female elderly than their male counterparts. In developing countries, including India, women report more about symptoms of their illness than men, which could be attributed to their higher prevalence of disease as outlined in this study [27,28]. Also, it has been noted that females tend to suffer from chronic debilitating conditions but not fatal ones, and this explains the paradox of high morbidity and less mortality among them compared to men [29]. In line with previous studies [26,30], the study noted a higher odds of CDs among rural elderly, whereas the risk of NCDs was higher among urban elderly than their respective counterparts. A sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity could expose the urban population to a high risk of NCDs [31,32]. Furthermore, nuclear family setup causing loneliness lack of care could be another reason of high NCDs among the urban population [33]. The ndings of higher odds of NCDs among highly educated and richest elderly agree with previous literature [30]. Educated and richest elderly are more likely to follow sedentary lifestyles, which could be a plausible reason for higher NCDs.


## Strengths And Limitations

The study has some potential limitations. The study has attempted to ll in the literature gap by examining the CDs and NCDs in a single study among the elderly in India using an extensive nationally representative sample survey-based data. Despite its considerable strength, the study has few signi cant limitations. The cross-sectional nature of data limits our understanding of causal interferences. Moreover, the reporting of NCDs could be affected by the recall bias.


## Conclusion

The burden of both CD and NCD among the elderly population requires immediate intervention. Among both types of diseases, the NCD is recognized as a more fatal and long-duration disease resulting from a combination and role of physiological, environmental, behavioural, and genetic factors throughout the life cycle. Although NCDs are treatable once diagnosed but as a prolonged health condition due to the sedentary lifestyle, it cannot be halted by providing treatment. The needs of men and women and urban and rural elderly must be addressed through appropriate effort. In a developing country like India, preventive measures, rather than curative measures of communicable diseases, will be cost-effective and helpful. Declarations Ethics approval and consent to participate: The authors were not involved in data collection process and therefore they did not require any ethical approval or consent to participate.

To maximize the cooperation of the sampled HHs and individuals, participants were provided with information brochures explaining the purpose of the survey, ways of protecting their privacy, and the safety of the health assessments as part of the ethics protocols. As per ethics protocols, consent forms were administered to each HH and age-eligible individual. In accordance with Human Subjects to: datacenter@iips.net for further processing. After successfully sending the mail, individual will receive the data in a reasonable time. Proportion of non-communicable diseases among elderly Non-communicable diseases


depicts the multiple logistic regression of CDs and NCDs among the elderly in India. The odds of NCDs were higher among female elderly (OR = 1.13; C.I. = 1-1.27) than their male counterparts. The odds of CDs decreased with an increase in education; however, the odds of NCDs increased with an increase in education. The results found that the odds of CDs were lower among higher educated elderly (OR = 0.62; C.I. = 0.47-0.81) than uneducated elderly, and odds of NCDs were higher among higher educated elderly (OR = 1.80; C.I. = 1.37-2.35) than their uneducated counterparts. Similarly, the odds of CDs were lower among urban elderly (OR = 0.67; C.I. = 0.59-0.76) than rural elderly, and odds of NCDs were higher among urban elderly (OR = 1.85; C.I. = 1.62-2.10) than their rural counterparts. The results were insigni cant for the association between CDs and wealth index; however, the odds of NCDs were higher among the richest elderly (OR = 1.93; C.I. = 1.63-2.28) than the poorest elderly. The odds of CDs (OR = 0.59; C.I. = 0.51-0.68) and NCDs (OR = 0.47; C.I. = 0.41-0.54)
