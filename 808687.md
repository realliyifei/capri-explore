Rotational curves are measured for almost complete sample of 308 northern spiral galaxies using the 6-m telescope. For observations we selected edge-on galaxies from RFGC catalog with apparent axial ratio a/b > 8, angular diameter a < 2 ′ , and declinations δ > +38 • above the Arecibo belt. About 97% of the galaxies are detected in the H-alpha line. For them a typical rotation curve extends till 87% of the standard galaxy radius. The rotation curve amplitude shows close correlation with a width of the HI line. The median radial velocity for the galaxies is 7800 km/sec, and the median maximum of the rotation curves is 137 km/s. These new observational data will be used to study cosmic streamings of galaxies seen on a scale of 200 Mpc.

The rotation curves of the galaxies from the flat galaxy catalog (FGC) (Karachentsev et al. 1993) have been studied at the Special Astrophysical Observatory since 1995. The goal of this is to estimate the rotation amplitudes and redshifts for northern-sky objects and to analyze the pecular velocity field of the FGC galaxies. The observing program has been finished in 1999 (Makarov et al. 1997a(Makarov et al. , 1997b(Makarov et al. , 1999(Makarov et al. , 2000, which allows us to summarize preliminary results.

The FGC catalog has a high degree of homogeneity and completeness, which make it one of the best existing samples for analyzing large-scale motions. For the observations, we select northern-sky galaxies with δ > +38 • with apparent axial ratios a/b > 8 and major axes in the range 0. ′ 6 < a < 2 ′ . The observations are being carried out with the 6-m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory by using an optically efficient prime-focus spectrograph.

These observations were used to estimate the amplitude and direction of the bulk motion of FGC galaxies with respect to the cosmic microwave background (Karachentsev et al. 1995(Karachentsev et al. , 1999. It follows from these studies that bulk motions of FGC galaxies with an amplitude of 300 ± 80 km/s are observed on scales of the order of 100 Mpc toward the concentration of rich Shapley clusters.

A preliminary analysis for 308 galaxies leads us to the following conclusions:

• The observation of thin edge-on galaxies are highly efficient. For more than 97% of the FGC objects, the contrast of the emission line is high enough to measure the typical galaxy rotation amplitude with an error of 10%, which as acceptable in the study of large-scale motions.

• The extent of the rotation curve for different galaxies lies in the range 0.45-1.45 with median value equal to 0.87 of the standard radius of a flat galaxy.

• Several rotation curve of edge-on galaxies appear signs of large extinction in the plane of the galaxy spiral arms, which is intersected by the line of sight at small angles.

• Nevertheless, the galaxies under study show a close correlation between the rotation amplitudes, as inferred from the H α and 21-cm HI lines with the rms deviation σ(V max ) = 12 km/s, which makes the use of flat galaxies to determine the distances from Tully-Fisher's diagram (Makarov et al. 1997a) very promising.

• The median radial velocity corrected to the Local Group motion equal to 7800 km/s. The galaxies studied are generally massive spirals with a median maximum of the rotation curve equal to 137 km/s.

These new observational data will be used to study cosmic streamings of galaxies seen on a scale of 200 Mpc.
