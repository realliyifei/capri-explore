Abstracts iv13NEURO-ONCOLOGY ADVANCES • NOVEMBER 2023 an extensive tumour debulking , corpectomy and posterior fusion.His neck pain resolved and myelopathy is stable at Nurick grade I. Histology Sections showed cellular tumor composed of spindle cells with little intervening stroma CD34 positive, progesterone receptor negative and EMA.STAT6 was positive confirming a solitary fibrous tumour.Patient has commenced adjuvant radiotherapy.Solitary tumours, formerly classified hemangiopericytoma are rare.In this case, the patient had had three previous inconclusive histological evaluations.Utilization of immunohistochemistry tests enabled the establishment of a conclusive diagnosis and treatment planning.Previously solitary fibrous tumors were classified as hemangiopericytomas with the option of three grades.However, in the current 2021 WHO 5th edition, the term hemangiopericytomas has been dropped to align these tumors fully with the soft tissue pathology nomenclature.These tumors have the characteristic alteration of the NAB2-STAT6 gene/molecular profile.

Dendritic follicular sarcoma (DFS) is a very rare and often poorly known neoplasia.It develops mainly in peripheral lymph nodes at the expense of dendritic follicular cells.However, extra nodal locations were also found in the literature.Diagnosis is often difficult, based mainly on histopathological and immunohistochemical data.There is currently no consensual therapeutic strategy proposed by the National Understanding Cancer Network.The aim of this work is to focus on the various epidemiological, histopathological, immunohistochemical and therapeutic aspects of the follicular dendritic sarcoma.We report the case of a cervical dendritic follicular sarcoma with literature review.This is a 51-year-old patient with no particular pathological history, consulting for a right lateral cervical mass evolving for 5 years without dyspnea, dysphagia, dysphonia, nor other associated signs evolving in a context of apyrexia and general state conservation.The clinical examination had objectified a firm, fixed, painless right upper jugulocarotid mass without inflammatory signs in sight.The cervical MRI had objectified two contigüe lateral cervical tissue masses well encapsulated, well limited necrotic with mass effect on the larynx without vascular enclosing.The patient had benefited from tumor reduction.Histology was in favor of a dendritic follicular sarcoma.Cervical CT was performed 2 months postoperatively which had shown a mixed right lateral cervical mass with thickened wall and hypodense center pushing in and back the primary carotid and forward the internal jugular vein without any sign of invasion locoregional.The patient then benefited from a complete removal of the tumor mass with ligation of the internal jugular vein.The anatomopathological study had objectified a tumor proliferation made of fusiform cells with nuclei augmented of irregular volume, nucleoli presenting moderate atypies without peri nervous engainement or neoplastic vascular emboli.Immunohistochemistry had shown positive antibodies anti-CD23, anti-CD35, anti-vimentin and anti-PS100.The Ki-67 index was positive on 15% of the cells.This profile concluded in a dendritic follicular sarcoma.The post-operative follow-up was simple.The patient was then referred to oncology for complementary radiation therapy.At 6 months no sign of recurrence was noted.Dendritic follicular sarcoma (DFS) is a relatively rare entity derived from dendritic follicular cells, which are B-cell antigen-presenting cells in the germinal centres of lymphoid follicles.It mainly affects the peripheral lymph nodes especially those of the head and neck.However, extra nodal tissues are affected in about 30% of cases especially the pharynx, oral cavity, thyroid gland.The diagnosis of SFD is difficult and often poorly understood, due to its silent symptomatology, extremely varied morphology and aspecific imaging.The main differential diagnoses are inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, pseudotumoral tumors, interdigitant dendritic cell sarcomas, lymphomas and undifferentiated carcinomas.Diagnosis is mainly based on pathological examination with immunohistochemical complement.


## FINAL CATEGORY: TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH ABSTRACT CITATION ID: VDAD121.055 TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH-02 THE KEYSTONE CYTOKINE, INTERLEUKIN-6, A KEY TARGET AND "ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE" FOR GLIOBLASTOMA THERAPY: A DECADE OF TRANSLATIONAL PROGRESS FROM GENOMICS TO THE LABORATORY AND TO A MULTICENTER CLINICAL TRIAL

Steven Brem; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA Interleukin-6 (IL-6), the 'keystone cytokine', affects homeostatic processes, including innate and adaptive immunity, and is regarded as a prominent target for clinical intervention (Hunter, 2015).IL-6 is also a senescence-associated-gene (SAG), linked to cellular aging, the aging brain, and cancer pathogenesis.We hypothesized that SAGs, including IL-6, are overexpressed in older patients, in higher grades of glioma, portending a poor prognosis (Coppola, 2014).Indeed, in an analysis of 47 gliomas at the Moffitt Cancer Center, we found that the 'senescence score' composed of genes central to the pathogenesis of glioma, defined a novel signature, provided prognostic biomarkers as well as targets for drug discovery and immunotherapy (Coppola, 2014).We suggested that IL-6 could be linked to neoplastic transformation and could be predictive of glioma progression (US Patent #8741575).At the University of Pennsylvania, we found an inhibitor of IL-6 to be well-tolerated in patients with glioblastoma undergoing CAR T cell therapy (O'Rourke, 2017).Yi Fan's team discovered (Wang, 2018) that targeting IL-6 led to a remarkable change in the tumor microenvironment (TME), with a "switch" from the M2 (immunosuppressive, pro-tumorigenic) macrophage phenotype to an immunostimulatory (M1) phenotype, resulting in a significant increase in survival.Adding CD40 agonist enhanced the activity of infiltrated T cells, and an almost complete cure in GBM models.The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in these experiments and by others (Lamano, 2019) produced a significant increase in survival.These findings led to a multicenter trial (PI, Stephen Bagley; NCT 047299959), by NRG Oncology (BN010), combining IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab), PD-L1 blockade (atezolizumab) and stereotactic radiotherapy to treat recurrent glioblastoma.More recently, a MDACC team discovered that IL-6 blockade not only promotes tumor immunity but also abrogates the toxicity of checkpoint blockade, decoupling the autoimmune toxicity while promoting tumor immunity through the IL-12 pathway (Hailemichael, 2022).


## ABSTRACT CITATION ID: VDAD121.056 TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH-03 MULTIPLE MECHANISMS MODULATE TEMOZOLOMIDE RESISTANCE AND ARE POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR GLIOBLASTOMA THERAPY.

Gaspar Kitange 1 , Jann Sarkaria 2 ; 1 The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, USA. 2 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor.Temozolomide (TMZ) is the only drug currently been used for treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients but the benefit from this agent has been hampered by the primary and secondary resistance.Thus, there is a strong need for uncovering the mechanisms of TMZ resistance.The DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is the main driver of primary TMZ resistance and lacking MGMT expression due to promoter hypermethylation has been associated with a significant survival prolongation.However, the MGMT-independent resistance mechanisms remain poorly understood.To investigate TMZ resistance mechanisms, we developed in vivo TMZ resistant models using GBM patient derived xenografts (PDXs) by treating animals bearing flank PDXs with clinically relevant 3-cyles of TMZ.The recurrent tumors were all resistant to TMZ through multiple mechanisms, including MGMT re-expression, elevated homologous recombination (HR) and/or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair activities, and loss of mismatch repair (MMR).However, other tumors developed resistance due to unknown mechanisms.To identify novel modulators of TMZ sensitivity, we performed genome wide screening using shRNA library, and we identified over 600 druggable targets.Validation experiments identified RBBP4 gene as one of the candidates involved in TMZ sensitivity.Silencing RBBP4 in GBM cells sensitized both MGMTmethylated and -unmethylated GBM cells to TMZ.Mechanistically, RBBP4 interacts with p300 to form a chromatin remodeling complex that control expression of DNA damage repair genes, and silencing RBBP4 or p300 significantly blocked the recovery of TMZ induced DNA double strand breaks causing cell death.We also found the nuclear pore exporter XPO1 is the modulator of TMZ sensitivity, and the XPO1 inhibitor Selinexor is currently being evaluated for GBM treatment in a clinical trial.Collectively, our work has uncovered multiple mechanisms of TMZ resistance that are potential targets for GBM therapy.
