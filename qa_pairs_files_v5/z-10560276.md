(p2.0) Soft tissue repair is a logical application -and, theoretically, the simplest application -for adipose-derived cell therapies since the isolated cells presumably do not need to display any transdiff erentiation potential. Both ASCs and SVF cells have been approved and employed in clinical trials involving soft tissue defects (summarized along with other published clinical studies in Table 2). Breast reconstruc tion or augmentation trials have enrolled the greatest number of patients. Plastic surgeons at the University of Tokyo have reported pioneering results using SVF cells in combination with intact lipoaspirate tissues. Yoshimura and colleagues have combined SVF cells with lipo aspi rates from equal volumes of tissue to augment breast volume [9][10][11]. In their clinical population of >70 subjects, these authors note improved fat grafting in the presence of the SVF cells with retention of volume for >1 year without evidence of fi brosis or adhesions. Complica tions such as cyst formation or microcalcifi cations occur in less than 2 to 3% of patients. Clinical trial reports in abstract form conducted by surgeons in Spain, South Korea, and elsewhere suggest similar outcomes [12].
