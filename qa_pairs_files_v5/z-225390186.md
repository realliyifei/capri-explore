(p8.0) The use of RGB imaging to acquire image data for plant species discrimination is well established. The RGB system of color cameras equipped with broadband filters is typical representatives of high spatial resolution systems with limited spectral resolution. Spatial resolution refers to the area where individual measurements can be made. Imaging systems with high spatial resolution can have pixel resolutions of the order of a few millimeters or even smaller [65]. Although only broadband reflectance images are acquired, it is sufficient to effectively distinguish plants from the background such as soil based on different spectral characteristics [66]. After segmenting the acquired image with broadband reflectance data, the features representing morphology or texture of plant canopy and plant leaf can be extracted for different plant differentiations.

(p8.1) RGB imaging and machine learning algorithms have been widely utilized for classification between crops and weeds. CNN in deep learning has high performance in object detection and automatic feature engineering with uncontrolled illumination. The CNN models were used to train plant RGB images and successfully identified sugar beet plants from weeds, which was suitable for online operation in the fields [67]. The classification results of CNN show that the recognition rate of weeds from soybean crops reached 91.96% [68][69][70][71]. Higher identification accuracy (92.89%) was obtained by CNN when the random initialization weights of CNN parameters was replaced by k-means unsupervised feature learning as pre-training process [72]. The best crop/weed identifier based on CNN achieved a high accuracy of 99.29% on classification of tomato and cotton from common weeds [73]. The ability of CNN and k-FLBPCM (filtered local binary patterns with contour masks and coefficient k) models was demonstrated to identify crop and weed species of similar morphologies such as canola and wild radish. In this study, based on both models, these weeds were effectively classified from barley crops at four different growth stages with accuracies up to 99% [74]. However, the k-FLBPCM model trained using images of large leaves collected in the fourth growth stage can accurately identify the smaller leaves of plants in the second and third growth stages, which cannot be done by CNN.
