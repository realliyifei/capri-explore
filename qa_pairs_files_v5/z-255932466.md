(p11.0) After obtaining correction of all components of the clubfoot deformity through serial casting and tenotomy, patients must wear a foot abduction brace (FAB) full-time for the first 3 months and part-time (night and nap time) for 4-5 years to maintain the correction and prevent relapse [48,49]. Ninety percent of relapses happen before the age of 5 years, which is why currently, the recommendation is to continue wearing the brace until that age even if the parents believe the deformity appears corrected prior. Noncompliance or failure to wear the FAB is one of if not the most significant factor leading to relapse of the deformity [36]. Two studies showed brace noncompliance rates of 41% and 36% were 183 and 120 times more likely to relapse compared to children who fully followed their bracing protocols [36,50]. Another error in bracing is attempting to fit a brace before the foot is fully corrected. Agarwal et al. showed that 7-10% of patients who had not achieved greater than 15 degrees of dorsiflexion, required stretch casts after tenotomy before bracing could be started [51]. One of the largest areas of variability in the Ponseti method is brace design, and as such, poor brace design will increase the risk of brace intolerance, as the brace may not be comfortable to wear and results in non-compliance with the bracing protocol [16,38]. Use of the correct type of brace is important because the child will only wear the brace if it is comfortable [48,52,53]. (Figures 9 and 10) Children 2023, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 17 the brace may not be comfortable to wear and results in non-compliance with the bracing protocol [16,38]. Use of the correct type of brace is important because the child will only wear the brace if it is comfortable [48,52,53]. (Figures 9 and 10) Figure 9.

Picture showing the principle of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole; this applies to fitting a clubfoot that is not fully corrected into a foot abduction brace (to be avoided).

(p11.1) Applying the FAB brace too tightly can cause an anterior ankle pressure area, while applying too loosely can cause foot slipping out of the brace a posterior heel pressure area, leading to brace intolerance (Figures 11 and 12). the brace may not be comfortable to wear and results in non-compliance with the bracing protocol [16,38]. Use of the correct type of brace is important because the child will only wear the brace if it is comfortable [48,52,53]. (Figures 9 and 10) Figure 9.
