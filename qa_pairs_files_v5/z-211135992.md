(p0.0) Over the last several decades, the use of low and no calorie sweeteners (LNCSs) has increased substantially. As such, and due to their high solubility in water, low absorption to soils, and reliable analytical methods, some LNCSs, including acesulfame-potassium (ACE-K) have been routinely detected in wastewater influents, effluents, and surface waters (see Table 1, as well as Supplemental Data Tables S3-S6 for a detailed collation of ACE-K's environmental monitoring studies). The major route of entry for ACE-K into the environment is as unchanged human excretion product that flows down the drain and is ultimately discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which were not originally designed to remove these compounds (Petrovic et al. 2004). Early research has indicated that many LNCSs, including ACE-K, are not completely removed by WWTPs, and thus there is a growing concern that ACE-K and its potential transformation products (TPs) may have an impact on the environment . Acesulfame-potassium is a common LNCS food and beverage additive, with its uses expected to increase (Sylvetsky and Rother 2016); therefore potential exposure to environmental organisms is likely chronic in nature.
