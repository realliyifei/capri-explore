(p9.0) Eastern and western monarchs are geographically and demographically distinct, though there is only modest evidence for phenotypic differentiation and no current evidence for genetic differentiation between them. In response to declining numbers of overwintering monarchs, many western states have proposed their own conservation measures. where do these monarchs go, what host plants do their offspring utilize, and how sensitive is the timing of this process to temperature and precipitation conditions? Furthermore, the role of non-native milkweed plantings, whose phenology differs from those of native milkweed species, should be investigated as a potential contributor to the decline of overwintering western monarchs. This line of research could include comparisons of cardenolide fingerprints (e.g. Malcolm et al. 1989, Knight and Brower 2009, Satterfield et al. 2018) of western monarchs through time to determine whether non-native milkweeds have become more prevalent, as well as community science initiatives to document the prevalence of non-native host use in areas near overwintering sites.
