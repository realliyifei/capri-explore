(p0.0) In 1964 the first laser and medical equipment were developed in the areas of ophthalmology, dermatology and general surgery. In dentistry, applications of lasers in dental tissues were first described in the 1990s, and approval for clinical use in 1997 [1]. We have some types of lasers in dentistry, among those that can be used in hard tissues, we highlight the Erbium lasers that have the ability to cut enamel, dentin, cement and bone, in addition to soft tissues, and remove some pathologies, including caries lesions. Among the advantages reported by professionals and patients when using erbium lasers for the management of hard tissues, are the reduction of uncomfortable noises, decreased intra and postoperative sensitivity, as well as a certain selectivity in the removal of tissues, as each tissue has a specific amount of water. The use of lasers in dentistry can be used in virtually all specialties [2].
