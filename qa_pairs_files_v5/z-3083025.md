(p27.0) Static analysis techniques are evaluated in [10]. Interface consistency rules and anomaly analysis revealed 2 and 4 faults of 28, respectively. We also analysed the effectiveness of three Java bug finding tools in [25]. After eliminating the false positives, the tools were able to find 81% of the known defects over several projects. However, the defects had mainly a low severity. For the severest defects the effectiveness reduced to 22%, for the second severest defects even to 20%. For lower severities the effectiveness lies between 70% -88%.
## (s32) Failure Probability

(p32.0) The failure probability of a fault is also one of the most difficult parts to determine in the economics model. Although there is the whole research field of software reliability engineering, there are only few studies that show representative distribution of such probabilities. The often cited paper from Adams [1] is one of the few exceptions. He mainly shows that the failure probabilities of the faults have an underlying geometric progression. This observation was also made in NASA studies reported in [17].
