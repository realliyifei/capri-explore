## (s4) Types of Restraints
Number of References: 5

(p4.0) The types of restraints used with in a hospital setting can be separated into two main categories: direct and indirect restraints [17,18]. Direct restraint (Table 1 and Figure 2) refers to equipment being used, whether specialised or not; examples include movable tables, bed sides, restraint belts, bed linen, locking the door or placing the patient into a position in which they cannot get up without assistance from staff. In some cases, nursing staff also used their own physical strength to keep the patient still [18]. Indirect examples include the promotion of passivity, whereby nurses restrict the patient's movements to only situations pertinent to their care by keeping mobility aids out of reach or employing a healthcare assistant only to make sure that the patient remains seated or does not walk too far from their bed space [19]. Many of those being physically restrained were also prescribed psychoactive medication [15].

## (s10) Attitudes Towards the Reasons Why Restraints are Used

(p10.0) A common justification for the use of restraints by healthcare staff as an intervention is to reduce risk factors that may compromise patient safety with altered mental status [37]. One nurse from this study remarked, "Physical restraints that we use here in the surgical intensive treatment unit are to maintain patient safety, and that includes not removing tubes. Keeping them (patients) so that they do not hurt themselves". The effect that sedation can have on mental state can be prolonged, and restraints are often justified until the patient's mental state can be assessed properly. Until then, life-saving therapies trump the reluctance which healthcare professionals may have to use restraints. The use of restraint is not favourable amongst healthcare staff for impairment management but a necessary evil for reducing falls and treatment interference [37,38]. Often, negative feelings are present towards the use of restraint, with a struggle between the duty of care and patient autonomy, which could sometimes foster feelings of guilt amongst healthcare staff [21]. Again, there is a difference in attitudes in other institutions. In a study in China, most healthcare professionals participating believed that restraint should be the first response when patients are at risk of endangering themselves [39]. Likewise, staff in that study often did not feel guilty when restraining patients [39]. However, in another study in which nurses based in a Chinese hospital were interviewed, the opposite was believed; restraint was often opposed due to its effect on patient dignity, and it was only used when relative consent was given [40]. This therefore shows that multiple sources need to be taken into consideration before casting judgements on the actions of healthcare staff in different environments.
## (s11) Staffing Levels and the Use of Restraints

(p11.0) A non-patient-centred element which can influence the use of restraint is staffing levels. The fact that many restraints are applied outside of normal working hours would support this [41]. In some studies, a significant reduction in restraint was found when the register nurse/patient ratio was higher [31]. However, rather than the issue being enough staff numbers, it has been suggested that the issue is not having enough trained staff. Better outcomes and fewer restraints were found to be used when there were higher numbers of well-trained staff [42]. This can vary from setting to setting. In an ITU setting, having more than one patient per member of staff makes it more difficult to prevent patients from pulling out medical devices. Therefore, the use of restraints would be implemented due to the inability to be vigilant with multiple patients [37]. However, in another study conducted in Germany, lower nurse staffing ratios were not related to higher frequencies of restraint use. This indicates the variable nature of this research and the potential need for a systematic review [26].

(p11.1) Another method to improve and reduce the amount of physical restraint used would be improving the education of healthcare staff. This would ensure correct knowledge and skills when using restraints, as well as alternatives which could be used beforehand, meaning that physical restraint would be a last resort [40]. Nursing staff are at the forefront of making decisions about restraint, and thoughtful decision-making is required to consider many factors. By providing training and education with clear guidelines, an appropriate, ethical decision can be made [43,44].
## (s12) Alternatives to Restraint
Number of References: 8

(p12.0) Restraint is often used as a non-challenging approach to difficult scenarios. However, avoiding the use of restraint may result in a reduction in the length of hospital stays [45]. Finding an appropriate non-resistant approach to care can be difficult but is optimal for patient autonomy and the prevention of the harmful consequences stated above. A clinical decision analysis model can be useful for determining a plan of action [46]. By looking at the reasons why restraints are used (for example, to reduce patient falls) and then assessing the situation and rectifying potential causes and hazards, restraint incidence can be reduced. Better lighting, lower beds, fewer obstacles and gym mats for a softer landing are examples which have been implemented with this goal in mind [47,48]. Other alternative practices involve patient-staff interaction and distraction. By listening to the wishes and needs of older patients and spending time with them, as well as encouraging the overall calm conduct of the nursing staff, patients can be settled as well as reducing the need for patients to inappropriately mobilise [18]. Also, encouraging them to spend time with other patients and arranging stimulating activities can improve the mental and social well-being of the patient and will keep them preoccupied. Supporting the patient's mobility and the use of mobility aids can also give the patient back their autonomy and reduce fall risks without having to use restraint [18]. Therefore, by assessing the situation before applying restraints, solutions can be applied to the problems directly rather than brutishly using restraint as an easier option (Table 4). However, it is accepted that this solution is not always applicable in every situation, and more alternatives are needed [49]. Listening and verbal interventions, despite being frequently used, are often perceived to not be effective [50], but by means of better education, this perception could be changed. 
## (s13) Conclusions

(p13.0) The use of restraints in a non-psychiatric healthcare setting can involve some blurred lines due to the use of direct and indirect restraints. It was found that the justification used was to prevent the incidence of patient falls, but restraints were also implemented to ease pressures brought about by staff shortages. The finding that the use of restraint decreased when there was a better nursing skill mix involved in patient care was particularly interesting. It is consistently found that having more educated and experienced nursing staff leads to better patient outcomes [51,52]. Therefore, by increasing staff knowledge of the subject matter, less restraint could be implemented in reducing falls and pressures on decreased staffing levels. Techniques such as having open lines of communication between staff and patients can avoid the need for mobilisation and the incidence of falls. Admittedly, this adds more roles to an already stretched workforce; however, these techniques when implemented will still reduce the use of restraint and reduce the length of hospital stays [45].
