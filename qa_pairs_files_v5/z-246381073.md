(p4.0) Reconstructed human epidermis is defined as a threedimensional reconstruction of primary keratinocytes extracted from human skin, amplified on an inert polycarbonate filter or collagen matrix, and exposed to an air-liquid interface, causing differentiation from the stratified epidermis. (15) EpiSkin™, EpiDerm™, and SkinEthic™ are OECD validated models that have reasonable similarities to natural human skin. (16)(17)(18) All models present with stratum corneum, spinosum, granulosum, and basale, as well as natural human skin, with a relatively thicker stratum corneum in the in vitro models (12µm to 37µm) compared to natural human skin (10µm to 12µm), because of the absence of cutaneous desquamation in the models.

(p4.1) Regarding lipid composition, there are some discrepancies compared to in vitro models. EpiDerm™ is most similar to natural human skin in terms of the amount of phospholipids, di-/triglycerides, and ceramides-4. SkinEthic™ is similar in amount to free fatty acids, ceramides-2a, and ceramides-3, and EpiSkin™ to cholesterol and ceramides-1, relative to natural human skin. (16)(17)(18) Natural human skin expresses some enzymes and proteins, such as keratin-1/10, loricrin, involucrin,  (4) Rarely presents interferences, but evaluates the entire protein content, requiring removal of dead cells from the plate to determine cell viability (5) pH-dependent absorption of the dye in the viable cell matrix. Not suitable for volatile, water unstable, and low solubility substances (6) Nanoparticles favor PI entry and increase false-positive results; higher cost than other techniques (7) High cost of instruments and markers, specialists for execution is needed, limited in the analysis of tissue architecture and intercellular interactions (8) Advantages Fast, easy-to-handle, low-cost model, with wide use and reproducible results
