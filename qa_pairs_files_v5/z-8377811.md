(p4.0) In primary human cancers, structural alterations of centrosomes have been first systematically studied in specimens of high grade metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. Several centrosome defects, including an increase in centrosome number and volume, with chaotic subcellular locations, accumulation of excessive PCM, supernumerary centrioles, as well as inappropriate accumulation of phosphocentrin during non-mitotic phases are frequently observed. In addition, breast tumour cells display functional centrosome abnormalities, as characterized by unusually large arrays of microtubules nucleated by an increased number of MTOCs [25]. Ultrastructural analysis of centrosomes via electron microscopy revealed that breast tumour cells contain numerous large centrioles surrounded by abundant densely-stained PCM, disrupted centriole barrel structure (open-ring and missing triplet microtubules), unincorporated microtubule complexes, centrioles of unusual length, centrioles functioning as ciliary basal bodies, and mispositioned centrioles [25,26]. Interestingly, tumours with excess PCM are highly anaplastic, lack normal cell polarity, and tend to have a higher median frequency of abnormal mitoses compared to tumours with other centrosome abnormalities [26].

(p5.0) Prostate cancer Support for CA contributing to genomic instability during prostate cancer development has been derived from data showing the increased frequency of centrosome abnormalities progressing from prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to non-metastatic and metastatic cancers, with the extent of defects correlating with the degree of CIN. Intra-tumoural centrosome abnormalities are also more severe and less variable in metastatic tumours than those in localized prostatic carcinoma. Centrosome size and number, as well as pericentrin levels are greater in high Gleason grade tumours, which correlates with the more advanced extent of CIN in these lesions [10,28,66,67]. In support of these findings, artificial induction of centrosome abnormalities in cultured prostate cells by overexpression of the centrosome protein pericentrin reproduces many features of aggressive prostate cancer. Overexpression of pericentrin induces severe centrosome and spindle defects, cellular disorganization, genomic instability and enhances growth in prostate epithelial cell lines [66]. There is evidence to support a role for cytokinesis defects in the generation of CA in prostate cancer. Overexpression of oncogenic kinase PIM-1 in prostatic epithelial cells leads to the development of mitotic spindle defects, multinucleation, and supernumerary centrosomes [68]. Non-functional p53 also promotes the formation of increased centrosome number and size in prostate cancer cell lines by abrogating the G2/M checkpoint control [69].
## (s7) Renal and adrenal tumours
Number of References: 3

(p7.0) In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), centrosome abnormalities and mitotic multipolarity are present in the subgroup displaying complex karyotypes. Interestingly, telomeric dysfunction and anaphase bridges are concomitantly observed in this subgroup of cancers, indicating the presence of two possibly related mechanisms i.e. CA and telomeric dysfunction, in the generation of genetic instability of RCC [81]. There is also a possibility that CA is a result of cytokinetic failure from repeated chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, due to mechanical blocking of cytokinesis by anaphase bridges. Overexpression of miR-210, a downstream target of HIF1Î±, has recently been reported to evoke CA and multipolar spindle formation in renal carcinoma cells [82]. CA has also been reported in adrenocortical adenomas and carcinoma [83].
## (s8) Cervical cancer
Number of References: 7

(p8.0) The mechanisms underlying CA in high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinogenesis has been extensively studied over the past decade. Centrosome aberration has been demonstrated in cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical carcinoma, most of which are aneuploid and positive for high-risk HPV infection [10]. CA is also associated with spindle defects and correlates positively with increasing grade of dysplasia, and is highest in lesions of invasive carcinomas [84]. Furthermore, CA is detected in organotypic raft cultures of human keratinocytes containing episomal HPV-16 DNA, even in basal cells with low copy numbers of HPV-16 genome [85], supporting its involvement in tumour initiation and progression.

(p8.1) In high-risk HPV-associated cervical carcinoma, a collaborative effort by the HPV-encoded oncoproteins E6 and E7 have been implicated in the generation of supernumerary centrosomes and multipolar mitoses, predisposing to CIN and carcinogenesis. Whilst stable expression of E6 or E7 in primary human keratinocytes results in abnormal centrosome numbers [13], co-expression results in an even higher number of cells with supernumerary centrosomes [86]. In addition, although acute expression of E7 alone rapidly induces abnormal centrosome numbers, that of E6 alone has no such effect [13]. In a transgenic mouse model of estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, E7 alone is sufficient to evoke CA, producing both high-grade cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical malignancies. E6 alone elevates centrosome copy number but do not produce cancer in the mice. However, E6 plus E7 additionally elevate centrosome copy number and create large, extensively invasive cancers, supporting the cooperative mechanism [87].
## (s9) Ovarian and testicular cancers
Number of References: 10

(p9.0) In ovarian adenocarcinoma, near-tetraploid tumours, which display greater numerical CIN, possess a higher degree of intratumoural CA; whereas near-diploid tumours show fewer abnormal centrosomes and comparatively lower numerical but higher degrees of structural CIN [102,103]. This implicates upon two distinct but possibly inter-related mechanisms for the generation of chromosomal aberration in ovarian carcinoma -one via copy-number instability associated with mitotic segregation abnormalities, cytokinesis errors and CA, and the other through structural change possibly as a result of impaired DNA repair [103]. Of clinical relevance, the prognostic significance of CA in ovarian cancer is demonstrated by its association with higher stage, histological grade, and the more aggressive serous-type compared to endometroid-type tumours [102]. In testicular germ cell tumours, those with aneuploidy are frequently associated with CA. Aneuploid seminomas and non-seminomas (including carcinoma-in-situ and infantile yolk sac tumours) show increased numbers of centrosomes. In contrast, the occurrence of CA in diploid infantile teratomas is less frequent [104].

(p9.1) High Aurora-A kinase expression strongly associates with supernumerary centrosome count in primary ovarian tumour cells but not in testicular germ cell tumours [104], and is an independent predictor of decreased survival in ovarian cancer patients [105]. Interestingly, HeyA8-MDR cells are more aggressive and chemoresistant compared to their parental HeyA8 cells, and their Aurora-A expression and cen-trosome count are significantly higher as well [105]. In relation, Aurora-A overexpression in ovarian cancer cell lines promotes CA, malformation of mitotic spindles and chromosome aberration. At the same time, Aurora-A suppresses the expression of p21, pRb, and BRCA2 to advance cell cycle progression and to abolish cellular apoptosis and DNA damage response [106]. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A kinase renders ovarian cancer cells resistant to drug-evoked apoptosis by activating the AKT survival pathway in a p53-dependent manner [107]. Taken together, this may suggest that poor outcome in ovarian cancer patients with Aurora-A kinase overexpression and CA may be a result of concomitant chemoresistance.
## (s13) Pancreatic cancer
Number of References: 7

(p13.0) CA is detected in primary pancreatic exocrine tumours, including both ductal carcinomas and adenomas [122], as well as in pancreatic cancer cell lines, particularly those with multipolar spindles, defective mitoses and CIN [123]. Interestingly, although CA is prevalent in exocrine tumours, endocrine malignancies show normal centrosome patterns and thus may arise through different genomic instability pathways [122]. Using orthotopic transplantation of Suit-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells into nude mice as a model, supernumerary centrosome numbers are found at higher frequencies in metastatic foci than in pancreatic xenografts, correlating with multipolar mitotic spindles and enhanced degree of CIN [124]. Aurora-A kinase is amplified in pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary pancreatic cancer [125], and is associated with CA, giant nuclei formation and CIN in vitro [126]. Taken together, this supports cytokinesis failure as a major mechanism underlying CA in pancreatic cancer. Cytokinesis failure and the tendency of p53-proficient binuclear and tetraploid cells to evade the tetraploidy checkpoint are commonly observed in an acinar-ductal transdifferentiating culture model of pancreatic carcinogenesis, predisposing to pleiotropic mitotic defects. In the context of p53 deficiency, uncontrolled polyploid progression ensues due to evasion of the tetraploidy checkpoint during cytokinesis failure, leading to a rapid exacerbation of CA and aneuplody [127].
## (s14) Lung cancer
Number of References: 18

(p14.0) CA has been demonstrated in a proportion of lung cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma [10,128,129], and correlates with aneuploidy. However, there is no significant relationship with clinical characteristics such as tumour size, disease stage, or patient survival [129]. In human lung cancer tissue, CA positively correlates with loss of pRb expression as well as with E2F1 and cyclin E overexpression [128,129]. At least some cells with CA ars also positive for p53 mutation, although correlative significance is absent [128][129][130]. The possible association of p53 loss with centrosome anomalies is supported by studies on p53-knockout murine bronchiolar epithelial "Clara" cells, presumably the origin of lung adenocarcinoma, which possess increased centrosome number and multinucleation, as compared to their wild-type p53 counterparts [131]. In addition, several studies have demonstrated a relationship between exposure to carcinogens implicated in lung cancer and the development of centrosome abnormalities in vitro. Specifically, exposure to chrysotile asbestos fibres [132], chromate particles [133,134], arsenite [135,136] and benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide [137] have been shown to induce CA, multipolar spindles, aneuploidy, as well as malignant transformation in human lung cell lines, which may be conditional on p53 dysfunction. Expression of Skp2 in lung cancer cells is associated with CA as well [138]. Recently, NORE1A, a gene commonly downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer, has been shown to suppress CA induced by hydroxyurea in lung cancer cell lines, implying a preventive role of NORE1A against carcinogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer [139].
## (s15) Neural cancer
Number of References: 22

(p15.0) CA has been demonstrated in several neural cancers [10], including aneuploid cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET) with p53 mutation [140], diffuse astrocytic gliomas of various histological grades [141], pituitary adenomas (PA) [142], as well as in medulloblastoma [143]. Gamma-tubulin staining is greater in adult high grade anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas as compared to low-grade diffuse astrocytomas [141]. Similarly, supernumerary centrosomes as well as higher Aurora-A mRNA expression levels are observed in high grade but not low grade glioma [144]. Comparing with normal brain tissue, mRNA expression for centrosomal structural proteins, such as centrin 3, gamma-tubulin, hNinein isoforms 1/2/5/6, Aurora-A and Aurora-B are elevated in glioma tissue [144]. Survivin suppression leads to CA in glioma cell lines, especially in the absence of p53 [145]. Loss of PTEN and expression of EGFRvIII transform neural precursor cells into tumours resembling glioblastomas, displaying CA, Aurora-A/B upregulation, and activation of Ras/Erk/AKT pathways [146]. Interestingly, variously pronounced gamma-tubulin localization is present in the cytoplasm of vascular endothelial cells in areas of tumour angiogenesis (microvascular proliferation) in glioblastomas [141]. This indicates that CA may underlie neoplastic neovascularization in glioblastomas. In support of this notion, endothelial cells in solid tumours are aneuploid and are curiously associated with multiple centrosomes as well [147].

(p15.1) In PA, CA is observed in somatotroph and lactotroph adenomas, which are characterized by aneuploidy and securin overexpression, in comparison to non-functioning adenomas or normal pituitary tissue [142]. In a mouse study, forced transgenic expression of cyclin E in the pituitary intermediate lobe results in CA [148]. In medulloblastoma, overexpression of gamma-tubulin is widespread in poorly differentiated, proliferating tumour cells but is significantly diminished in quiescent differentiating tumour cells undergoing neuritogenesis [143]. In primary neuroblastoma tumours, childhood and infant diploid tumours display greater CA than infant triploid tumours. Ploidy divergence accompanying tetraploid cells, implying cytokinesis failure, occurs very frequently in infant diploid but not infant triploid tumours. However, although CA is found in the majority of childhood diploid tumours, none of these show ploidy divergence, suggesting centrosome overdu-plication as the mechanism of CA in this group of tumours [149]. CA may be associated with MYCN locus amplification in primary neuroblastoma [149,150]. This is supported by in vitro observations, whereby in neuroblastoma cell lines, MYCN overexpression induces CA in response to a DNA damage stimulus such as ionizing radiation [150,151]. Suppression of p27 expression through increased expression of Skp2 [152], as well as MDM2-mediated negative regulation of p53 activity [150] may underlie this DNA damage-evoked CA.
## (s16) Head and neck cancer
Number of References: 22

(p16.0) CA has been observed in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) [153][154][155][156][157][158][159], benign salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas [155], as well as in thymic carcinoid tumour [160]. Strong prognostic implications have been demonstrated in HNSCC. High intratumoural CA is associated with local tumour recurrence of surgically-resected oral SCC despite histologically-negative margins. Interestingly, analysis of the tumour margins for CA found a trend toward local tumour recurrence in patients whose margins showed high degree of CA [154]. CA is also observed in oral epithelial dysplasia. The percentage of cells containing CA is more frequent in oral SCC than dysplasia, as well as in poorly-differentiated oral SCC relative to moderate-and well-differentiated subtypes [158]. Collectively, this strongly implicates upon CA as a major mechanism driving the initiation and progression HNSCC. In laryngeal SCC, presence of cells with large centrosomes is a better predictor of tumour recurrence compared to T stage, and even predicts recurrence in node-negative tumours. Moreover, this group of patients shows a near-significant trend for shorter survival and thus poor prognosis [159]. In another study, CA is associated with tumour size, stage, distant metastasis, disease-free survival and overall survival [157].

(p16.1) There is evidence to support cytokinesis failure as the major mechanism underlying CA in HNSCC, which may involve Aurora-A kinase upregulation [156], MDM2-p53 dysregulation [153], and decreased myosin light chain phosphorylation [161]. Aurora-A kinase mRNA and protein upregulation are frequently occurring in HNSCC and are associated with CA and poor patient prognosis [156]. The underlying mechanism linking Aurora-A kinase overexpression and CA remains unclear, but its interaction with important cell cycle regulators such as p53 may be contributory. Notably, Aurora-A kinase is known to phosphorylate and promote the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 [56]. In earlier studies, CA have been correlated with the occurrence of either muta-tion/deletion of p53. Interestingly, in tumours that retained wild-type p53, CA is associated with MDM2 overexpression instead [153]. In corroboration with these findings, Swiss 3T3 cells overexpressing stably-transfected MDM2 show extensive CA and CIN, despite retaining wild-type p53 [153]. The actual relationship between Aurora-A kinase and the MDM2-p53 pathway in generating CA in HNSCC remains to be further elucidated.

(p16.2) Dysfunctional telomeres have been suggested to play a possible role in the generation of CA in HNSCC. HNSCC and benign salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas displaying abnormal karyotypes showed widespread centrosome aberration and multipolar division, together with anaphase bridges. The frequency of anaphase bridges correlates with number of chromosome ends lacking TTAGGG signals, indicating the presence of telomere shortening. This repeated chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge cycles has been proposed to prevent normal cytokinesis, leading to centrosome accumulation along with multinucleation, multipolar cell division, and aneuploidy [155]. These cells however, may be at an evolutionary dead-end with limited contribution towards tumour development, since mitoses with five or more poles are very rarely observed [155].
## (s18) Kaposi sarcoma
Number of References: 8

(p18.0) The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) has been linked with several human malignancies, including all subtypes of Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. Kaposi sarcoma lesions are latently infected by KSHV and express latent genes, such as KSHV cyclin (K cyclin) and latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Expression of K cyclin in human endothelial cells induces senescence and strong DNA damage response, leading to CA and S-phase arrest through a CDK6 and ATM-Chk2-dependent pathway [168]. In human and mouse primary fibroblasts, K cyclin expression results in a p53-dependent growth arrest, abortive cytokinesis and centrosome accumulation [169]. In the absence of p53, the K cyclin-induced CA is exacerbated, leading to the acquisition of an aneuploid population of cells which is not only genetically unstable but also resistant to apoptosis [169]. In line with these findings, in vivo studies demonstrated accelerated K cyclin-induced lymphomagenesis in mice without p53 [170]. Notably, KSHV infection of endothelial cells generates supernumerary centrosomes and multinucleation [168,171], suggesting that the hindrance of tumour progression due to p53-triggered growth arrest and apoptosis may be overcome by other latent viral genes. Indeed, LANA is able to bind p53 and inhibits the ability of p53 to transactivate cellular genes, resulting in abnormal centrosomes, multinuclear cells, and other genomic abnormalities [172]. In KSHV-infected cells, NPM1 is a phosphorylation substrate for CDK6/K cyclin necessary for centrosome duplication, and p53-driven apoptosis occurring downstream of NPM1 phosphorylation is a critical checkpoint mechanism that prevents accumulation of cells with supernumerary centrosomes, which may be overcome by LANA co-expression [173].
## (s21) Chronic myeloid leukaemia
Number of References: 11

(p21.0) In CML patients, the presence of CA in CD34+ BCR-ABL1-positive cells is an early event in CML development, and precedes CIN that is associated with advanced disease. Cells from chronic phase (CP) specimens display mostly numerical centrosome abnormalities with a uniform morphology, in contrast to those from blast crisis (BC) specimens showing irregularly-shaped amorphous amplification (so-called "centriolar satellite material") on top of a high rate of numerical alteration [183,184]. Cells with CA are more evident in BC in comparison to CP specimens while the extent of CA strongly correlate with karyotype instability and aneuploidy, giving support to a prognostic value of centrosome status in CML [183].

(p21.1) CML is characterized by the BCR-ABL1 translocation, which produces the p210 BCR-ABL1 fusion protein that localizes to the centrosome in K562 cell lines. Cell lines expressing p210 BCR-ABL1 exhibit more CA than p210 BCR-ABL1 negative cells [184], in keeping with earlier observations that BCR-ABL1 transgene expression induces CA in cell lines in a time-dependent manner [185]. Interestingly, tyrosine kinase inhibitors including imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib lead to de novo induction of CA, lending a possible explanation to the emergence of BCR-ABL1-negative clones with aberrant karyotypes and secondary malignancies (e.g. AML and myelodysplastic syndrome) with prolonged treatment using these drugs [184][185][186][187][188]. CA has also been detected in disease-unrelated cells/tissues in patients treated with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, sorafenib and sunititib [189]. These findings though, remain more of a scientific enigma. It cannot be excluded that these genomically-unstable cells would be incapable of further proliferation, and thus do not pose any significant danger towards neoplastic development.
## (s22) Acute myeloid leukaemia
Number of References: 3

(p22.0) Numerical and structural CA has been described as a potential cause of aneuploidy in AML. AML blasts with high degree of numerical and structural CA contain numerical CIN, and possess higher expression levels of genes coding for proteins involved in stimulating G1/S transition, DNA replication, as well as centrosome-associated proteins such as pericentrin and TUBGCP2. Furthermore, higher frequency of CA is associated with cytogenetically-defined adverse risk groups, as defined by the MRC AML 10 trial as favourable (22.5%), intermediate (35.3%), and adverse (50.3%). Interestingly, this is mainly attributed to structural rather than numerical centrosome aberrations [190,191]. Numerical centrosome abnormalities are observed in a study of 25 patients with hematopoietic bone marrow failure disorders with a risk for evolution into AML, including myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anaemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. Increased centrosome copy number positively correlates with aneuploidy, and samples with the highest percentage of CA tends to be aneuploid for the most chromosomes. This suggests that CA may be associated with the development of a clonal population of potentially pre-leukemic aneuploid hematopoietic progenitor cells in bone marrow failure patients [192].
## (s23) Adult T-cell leukaemia
Number of References: 6

(p23.0) CA is also observed in ATL, a condition causally linked to human T lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) infection [193,194]. Tax, a HTLV-1 transactivator protein, localizes to the centrosome, deregulates CDK activity and induces CA in JPX-9 cell lines, suggesting an association with cellular transformation by HTLV-1 and CIN in HTLV-1-infected human T cells [194]. Tax may be directly responsible for genomic instability and aneuploidy in ATL cells through the interaction with Ran-BP1 and coiled-coil protein TaxIBP2. The interaction of Tax with Ran-GTPase pathway via Ran-BP1 regulates centrosome stability and is necessary for Tax localization to centrosomes as well as its induction of CA. Disruption of Tax-IBP2-Tax interaction results in failure of CA triggering by Tax, while TaxIBP2 downregulation leads to CA, suggesting that TaxIBP2 is an intrinsic block to centrosome overduplication [193,195,196].
## (s25) Diagnostic, predictive and prognostic implications
Number of References: 21

(p25.0) The diagnostic utility of centrosome abnormalities has been repeatedly discussed in previous studies, yet its usefulness as a biomarker for cancer detection has never been thoroughly investigated. Based on earlier observations, CA in normal or benign tissue is a rare phenomenon. In most studies, no CA could be detected in normal human cells including those of the breast, prostate, lung, brain, colon [10], bladder [76], kidney [81], cervix [84], testis [104], ovary [105], liver [117], pancreas [122], head and neck [157], and blood [183] in contrast to their malignant counterparts. However, in studies on benign breast lesions, centrosome abnormalities were not found in mastopathia or fibroadenoma [29], while another study observed structural centrosomal abnormalities occasionally in the benign lesions studied (3 of 25, including mastopathia, intraductal papilloma and fibrocystic mastopathy) [35]. Apart from those of the breast, non-malignant tumours from other sites such as soft tissue [81,165,166] and pancreatic adenoma [122] have been shown to harbour CA, suggesting that the presence of CA alone is not a sufficient criterion to diagnose malignancy. In addition, although CA is frequently present to some extent in most cancers, it is not an invariable phenomenon [ Table 1]. Thus, the lack of CA may not necessarily exclude malignancy either. Nonetheless, the utility of centrosome status as a differential diagnostic marker may be augmented when employed in adjunct to contemporary methods. CA may also be of clinical utility where tissue availability is limited, as demonstrated in cytological aspirates of breast lesions [29,35].

(p25.1) In HNSCC, those with high degree of CA in tumour margins recur more frequently than those with less CA. This finding is interesting, given that these margins are histologically negative for malignant cells, the latter of which clinically implies adequate surgical resection [154]. Given such observations, it is tempting to speculate that malignant, or at least potentially malignant cells harbouring CA within these margins that escape histological detection, may be responsible for eventual tumour recurrence and poor prognosis. In parallel, CA occurs in matched adjacent normal or hyperplastic regions of NSCLC as well [128,129], although their clinical significance remains unknown. In such cases, CA in the tumours and/or their margins may define a subgroup of patients who may benefit from more extensive cu-rative surgery, more aggressive adjuvant treatment, and closer monitoring for disease recurrence.
## (s26) The centrosome as a cancer therapeutic target
Number of References: 12

(p26.0) Potentially, the centrosome can be a therapeutic target for the treatment of cancers. The selective killing of cells with CA has been investigated via targeting specific altered proteins/pathways peculiar to these cells. Centrosome duplication in normal non-neoplastic cells differs mechanistically from pathways leading to CA in cancer cells, and these differences may be exploited to selectively kill target cancer cells while leaving normal cells relatively unaffected [89][90][91]. Of particular significance, small molecule centrosome-associated protein kinase inhibitors, such as Aurora-A kinase and Polo-like kinase inhibitors have recently shown promising results in clinical trials [201]. Also, AhR agonists such as indirubins reduce centriole overduplication and may imply a novel role for chemoprevention in breast cancer [65]. Likewise, targeting the compensatory mechanisms of bipolar spindle formation, such as inhibition of centrosome clustering, may be a potential mode of promoting cancer cell death [21]. Conversely, it may also be plausible that agents that promote centrosome clustering may delay tumour progression by limiting CIN.

(p26.1) Another attractive approach to discriminatory cancer cell eradication invokes exploiting the possible additional burden of excess centrosomes on the cell cycle [202]. In these cells with CA, the threshold to apoptosis induced by drugs [203] or radiation [145] may be much lower. For example, the partial inhibition of PARP1 in BRCA1-deficient cells has been suggested to represent a possible chemopreventive or therapeutic approach for BRCA1-deficient breast cancers, via its induction of severe chromosome aberrations, CA, telomere dysfunction and apoptosis [204]. Survivin inhibition in glioma cells has also been shown to enhance CIN and radiosensitivity via induction of CA [145]. The induction of CA using agents that delay S-phase but at insufficient doses to trigger apoptosis, such as low dose 5-FU, has been suggested as a novel mode of chemosensitization approach to cancer therapy [203]. However in all these approaches, one should be mindful of evoking CA in normal cells and risk of secondary carcinogenesis as a consequence of amplified genomic instability. In addition, cancer cells which evade apoptosis despite being induced with a greater degree of centrosome aberration and genomic instability may eventually develop an even more aggressive phenotype. These theoretical concerns warrant further investigations before this therapeutic approach may be considered for clinical utility.
