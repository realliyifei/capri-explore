(p2.0) To obtain polysaccharide fractions from the various Panax species, different extraction methods are used to extract different polysaccharides, including hot water/ethanol extraction [29,[34][35][36], alkaline extraction [37,38], enzymatic extraction [39][40][41], and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extraction [42]. Other new methods, such as ultrasonic extraction [43,44] and microwave extraction [45], have been performed to extract polysaccharides from Panax species and these can improve extraction efficiency and decrease extraction time.

(p2.1) Most studies report that hot water extraction was used to isolate the polysaccharides from three Panax species, which is the most classical and convenient method for isolating water-soluble crude polysaccharide [29,46]. Briefly, the roots of Panax species were soaked in water overnight and boiled in water (2-4 times, 2-6 h each time) to obtain the supernatants, which were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min and concentrated under vacuum. The crude extracts were precipitated with cold ethanol at 4 • C for 24 h and deproteinated by the Sevag method to obtain crude polysaccharides [9]. Some reports showed that 80-95% ethanol was used to remove lipophilic compounds and increase purity before water extraction [36,47], which can increase the rate of extraction of polysaccharides from ginseng [48]. In fact, different extraction methods have been used to prevent the destruction of polysaccharide structures and bioactivities. EDTA extraction was used to extract pectin-type polysaccharides with high efficiency [42].

(p2.2) After water extraction, alkali extraction of acid polysaccharides with Na 2 CO 3 , 1 M KOH, or 4 M KOH is suitable when high temperature may degrade the activities of some polysaccharides [37,49]. Furthermore, enzyme-assisted extraction methods can destroy granular starch and enable a higher extraction yield of polysaccharides. Two enzymes, α-amylase and cellulase, were used to effectively extract ginseng polysaccharides with different structures and activities, compared with that of water extraction [39,40]. Microwaveassisted extraction is a novel, quick, and efficient method for extracting polysaccharides with higher bioactivities and a higher yield rate (41.6%) than that of hot water extraction (28.5%) [45]. For two other Panax species, water extraction has been used to isolate crude polysaccharides, and alkaline extraction [38,50,51], ethanol extraction [34,52], or ultrasonic extraction [43] have seldomly been used. Current studies demonstrate that the polysaccharide extraction rates for American ginseng and notoginseng by alkali or methanol ranged from 1.8% to 2.8% [51]. Based on these findings, we conclude that different polysaccharides from three species can be isolated with different reagents, enzymes, or equipment to avoid the disadvantages of extraction processes and obtain high-yield and high-activity polysaccharides. Importantly, a combined method might be a more optimal strategy for extracting polysaccharides with different structures and bioactivities.
## (s3) Separation and Purification
Number of References: 10

(p3.0) After ethanol precipitation and deproteinization, crude polysaccharides are purified and fractionated by column chromatography and membrane separation technology [53]. Column chromatography methods, including gel column chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography, are commonly used to purify the polysaccharides from three Panax species [39,47,54]. Gel column chromatography, which includes dextran-and agarose-gel columns, acts as a molecular sieve and separates polysaccharide molecules according to their size and shape [39,55]. As previously reported, the polysaccharides from ginseng were purified using Sephadex G-25 or G-75 columns [39,55]. A study showed that four polysaccharides from notoginseng were purified using gel filtration chromatography [56]. For ion-exchange chromatographic separation, an anion-exchange column packed with diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose, DEAE-dextran gel, or DEAE-agarose gel has been the most used to separate ginseng polysaccharides. These materials possess different advantages, including large adsorption capacity, strong stability, fast elution, and weak protein binding [53].

(p7.0) As published in 2020, the structural characteristics and immunomodulatory properties of American ginseng polysaccharides have been summarized [21]. In this review, we summarize the structural features of polysaccharides from American ginseng from all publications until April 2021, which are listed in Table 2. An extraction was performed for 25 similar polysaccharides from American ginseng using hot water or 0.3 M NaOH, and DEAE-Sepharose or Sephacryl S-300 columns were used for purification. The structural characteristics of five main fractions from American ginseng polysaccharides were elucidated by multiple techniques, which demonstrates that they have different molecular weights, ranging from 3.1 × 10 3 to 9.7 × 10 6 Da, as well as different sugar components, consisting of Ara, Rha, Xyl, Man, Gal, Glc, GalA, and GlcA [57]. NMR spectroscopy showed that these five polysaccharides mainly contain (1→6)-α-D-Glcp, (1→5)-α-L-Araf, (1→4)-β-D-Rhap, (1→4)-α-D-Manp, β-D-Galp, and β-D-xylose [57]. Non-starch polysaccharides from the roots of American ginseng (GSP) consist of Rha, Ara, Gal, Glu, and uronic acid with a weight ratio of 1:4:8:8:50 and contain a major sugar residue (4-α-D-GalpA) and other residues (2-α-L-Rhap, 2,4-α-L-Rhap, α-L-Araf, β-D-Galp, and 4-β-D-Galp), which suggests that GSP is a pectin molecule with HG and a small portion of RG-I [77]. AGC1 is a neutral polysaccharide isolated from suspension cultures of American ginseng. AGC1 has an average molecular weight of 5.2 kDa and is composed of >60% Gal and other neutral sugars (Ara, Xyl, Glu, Man, and Rha) and primarily contains 48.5% 3-linked Galp, 10.2% 3,6-linked Galp, 5.2% terminal, and 4.4% 6-linked galactopyranosyl residues [78]. Moreover, the major glycosidic linkages, including terminal (47.7%), 4-linked (15.6%), and 6-linked (8.1%) galactopyranosyl residues, 2,4-linked rhamnopyranosyl residue (8.1%), and 4-linked galacturonopyranosyl residue (6.8%), were found in an acidic polysaccharide, AGC3, with the presence of RG-I pectin [79]. Moreover, other polysaccharides from hot water extraction have also been reported to examine their molecular weight, sugar composition, and structural features [51,[80][81][82][83]. After extraction of American ginseng root with 0.3 M NaOH, fractions AEP-1 and AEP-2 were obtained, which consist of Gal, Glc, and GalA with a molar ratio of 0.97:4.67:3.92 and Gal, Glc, Ara, Man, and GalA with a molar ratio of 1.68:3.02:1.03:0.76:3.65, respectively [38]. In addition, microwave-assisted extraction of American ginseng root yielded specific polysaccharides from different locations that contain Rha, Ara, GalA, Man, Glc, and Gal with different ratios of monosaccharide composition [61]. A new report demonstrated that polysaccharides from American ginseng extracted by ultrasonication consist of Ara, Rha, GalA, Man, Glc, and Gal with a ratio of 31:4:1:2:72:59 and present 1→4 glycosidic linkages and a →4)-GalA-(1→ moiety [30]. Based on current findings, there are fewer articles on American ginseng polysaccharides than those on ginseng polysaccharides. Importantly, American ginseng polysaccharides should be further investigated in the future to elucidate their chemical structures as analytical techniques progressively improve.    
## (s8) Polysaccharides from Notoginseng

(p8.0) The structural characteristics of notoginseng polysaccharides have been studied for more than 30 years. In 1987, a polysaccharide with a molecular mass of 1.50 × 10 6 Da, sanchinan-A, was examined to determine whether terminal arabinofuranosyl, terminal galactopyranosyl, and 3-, 6-, and 3,6-linked galactopyranosyl residues were present [84]. In 1996, it was determined that four polysaccharides were heteroglycans with molecular weights of 37-760 kDa and were composed of Glu, Gal, Ara, Man, and Xyl in different molar ratios [56]. A fraction from the root of notoginseng called AIR contains cellulose and pectic polysaccharides, including 24% HG and 2% acidic RG-I, with high levels of type I 4-galactans and low levels of xyloglucan [50]. Fr, a fraction from AIR extracted with 1 M KOH, is composed of 4-galactans, heteroxylans, and small amounts of arabinan and HG. Its acidic fraction, 1MD3-G2, has a molecular weight of 1.14 × 10 6 Da and contains 45% type I 4-galactan, 10% HG, 11% arabinan, 28% heteroxylan, and 4% RG-I [58]. It was reported that an arabinoglucogalactan (1) from notoginseng roots possesses (1→3)-linked β-d-galactofuranosyl and α-l-Ara f-(1→4)-β-d-Glcp-(1→ residues [85]. Three polysaccharides from different parts of P. notoginseng, MRP, BRP, and FRP, have different chemical and monosaccharide compositions [26]. RN1 is an arabinogalactan polysaccharide and possesses a backbone of 1,6-linked Galp and branches of 1,5-linked, 1,3,5-linked, terminal Ara, and terminal Gal [86]. Notoginseng polysaccharides from different locations were obtained by microwave-assisted extraction. They were named N1-N5, and contain Rha, Ara, GalA, Man, Glc, and Gal, which contain 11.9-15.0 mg/g of specific polysaccharides, as determined by the HPSEC-MALLS-RID method [61]. Two novel polysaccharides, MAP5A (113.8 kDa) and MRP5 (91.6 kDa), are composed of Gal, Glu, Ara, and Rha in different ratios. MRP5 contains →3)-β-Glcp-(1→, →3)-β-Galp-(1→, →3,6)-β-Galp-(1→, →3)-β-Galp-(1→, →3,6)β-Galp-(1→, →3)-α-Rhap-(1→, →3)-α-Araf-(1→, and α-Araf-(1→ repeating residues [87]. PNPS-0.5M is a novel acidic polysaccharide that is a notoginseng residue and it contains a backbone of (4→1)-linked GalA, (1→)-, (5→1)-linked Araƒ, and (1→)-linked Rhap branches [43]. PNPS-0.3 is another polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 76.655 kDa that mainly consists of a backbone of →4)-α-D-GalAp-(1→4-β-L-Rhap-1→4)-β-D-Galp-(1→ residues and a branch of α-L-Araf-1→5)-α-L-Araf-(1→ [32]. A new study to isolate water-soluble polysaccharides from notoginseng discovered a starch-like polysaccharide, PNPN, and its pectin fractions. Its structural characteristics were analyzed using multiple methods and it contains Gal, Ara, GalA, and Rha, with different sugar compositions and molecular weights [29]. Among these sub-fractions, two fractions mainly include 1,4-β-D-galactans, 1,5-α-L-arabinan, and AG-II and three fractions consist of HG, together with different ratios of RG-I and RG-II domains [28]. Structural fingerprinting analysis suggests that PPN, a crude polysaccharide from notoginseng extracted by ultrasonication, contains Ara, GalA, Man, Glc, and Gal, with a molar ratio of 2:1:2:83:7, contains 1→4 glycosidic linkages and shows an abundant amount of →4)-Hexp-(1→ [30]. For neutral polysaccharides from notoginseng, the molecular weights of five polysaccharides ranged from 1.81 × 10 4 to 10.56 × 10 4 Da [2]. In addition, a fermented polysaccharide from notoginseng exhibited higher levels of polysaccharides, compared with that extracted by water, but further investigation is required to determine its structural characteristics [2]. Collectively, 36 polysaccharides from notoginseng have already been found and their molecular weights, composition, and structural features have been summarized in Table 3. A future research direction should be to obtain the detailed structural characteristics, such as the backbone, different branches, and glycosidic linkages, of different notoginseng polysaccharides.       To further compare the similarities and differences of the polysaccharides from three Panax species, we summarized the extraction method, purification method, molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, and structural characteristics of these polysaccharides in Table 4. Ginseng polysaccharides have been extensively studied for many years, and the polysaccharides from the other two species have been recently investigated. Hot water, alkali, enzymes, EDTA, and microwaves are commonly used methods for extracting polysaccharides, especially from ginseng samples. Recently, ultrasonication was used to extract and obtain polysaccharide fragments from three Panax species. Moreover, DEAEcellulose, Sepharose G-50 and CL-6B columns, dialysis, and ultrafiltration are used for purification to isolate different fragments of the polysaccharides from three Panax species. Importantly, the polysaccharides from American ginseng and notoginseng should be highly purified using different purification methods. The molecular weights of these polysaccharides encompass very broad ranges with different sizes, which might be related to the methods used for extraction and purification. For the monosaccharide composition, Ara, Gal, GalA, Glc, GlcA, Man, and Rha are commonly found in the polysaccharides from the three Panax species; Arab, Fru, Fuc, Rib, and Xyl were only discovered in ginseng polysaccharides. AG-I, AG-II, HG, RG-I, RG-II, and glycosidic linkages are extensively found in ginseng polysaccharides. The polysaccharides from the other two species consist of RG-II, galactan, and arabinopyranosyl residues, which should be further investigated. Collectively, the structural features of the polysaccharides from the three species, especially American ginseng and notoginseng polysaccharides, should be explored using a series of new techniques.
