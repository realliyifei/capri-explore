## (s5) BDKRB2
Number of References: 18

(p5.0) Bradykinin (BK) is a vasodilator, released from kininogens [59,60].

(p5.1) BK is involved in various biological processes and its action is mainly mediated by one of its two receptors, the bradykinin 2 receptor (BDKRB2) [61]. The receptors are located on the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells and the vascular endothelium [48]. The activation of BDKRB2 results in increased skeletal muscle glucose uptake during physical activity, increase of muscle blood flow, and as a result higher endurance performance [47].

(p5.2) BDKRB2 is encoded by the BDKRB2 gene, located on chromosome 14q32 and expressed in most human tissues. An insertion/ deletion polymorphism of 9 base pairs (bp) (-9/+9, rs5810761) in exon 1 is the most frequently investigated polymorphism in the context of relationships between genotypes and athletic status [47]. The -9bp allele is associated with higher gene transcriptional activity, higher mRNA expression, and increased receptor activity [62,63].

(p5.3) As a result, the -9 allele may be connected with higher skeletal muscle metabolic efficiency and endurance performance [47]. Indeed, The BDKRB2 -9 allele was found to be associated with endurance performance [47,48,[64][65][66]. Specifically, The BDKRB2 -9 allele was over-represented in long-distance (800-1500 m) swimmers compared to controls (72.2 vs 45.9%; P = 0.032) [64]. The +9 allele was over-represented in short-distance (50-100 m) swimmers compared to controls (67.9 vs 54.1%; P = 0.044) [64], and the +9/+9 BDKRB2 genotype was associated with a greater improvement in swimming performance in response to training [68]. However, in another study, Grenda et. al [67] statistically significant differences in BDKRB2 genotype and allele frequencies between long-distance swimmers and the total group of swimmers or controls, meaning that the BDKRB2 -9/+9 polymorphism was not associated with swimming performance at short, middle or long distance, regardless of gender among Polish swimmers.
## (s6) AMPD1
Number of References: 28

(p6.0) Adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) is a very important regulator of muscle energy metabolism during exercise [68][69][70].

(p6.1) AMPD plays a pivotal role in ATP production through converting AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP) [68][69][70][71][72] as well as in glycolytic pathway regulation [68,71,72]. AMPD expression in skeletal muscle is dependent on muscle fibre composition [68,[70][71][72]. A decrease in AMPD activity was reported concurrent with an increase in the proportion of fast-twitch (type II) fibres affecting, therefore, intense anaerobic physical activity [73][74][75].

(p6.2) The gene encoding the isoform (AMPD1) is located on chromosome 1 (1p13). AMPD1 is mainly expressed in fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibres. Differential AMPD1 gene expression may contribute to quantitative variations in enzyme activity across muscle groups with different types of fibres [71,72,75]. The nonsense mutation c.34C > T (rs17602729) in exon 2 of the AMPD1 gene converts glutamine codon (CAA) into the premature stop codon (TAA), which results in the early interruption of protein synthesis and appears to be the main cause of AMPD deficiency [76].

(p6.3) TT carriers have extremely low skeletal muscle AMPD activity compared to CT and CC carriers [71,75]. T allele prevalence is lower among elite endurance athletes compared to controls [70,77,78]. A significant deficiency of the T allele was noted among short-distance swimmers compared to controls [79] suggesting, that short-distance swimming requires endurance abilities.
## (s9) VEGFR2
Number of References: 7

(p9.0) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major growth polypeptide regulating skeletal muscle angiogenesis [121]. VEGF is associated with proportion of oxidative skeletal muscle fibres (type I) and maximal rate of oxygen consumption [122,123]. VEGF acts via two major receptors, VEGF1 and VEGFR2, localized mostly in the vascular endothelium [121].

(p9.1) The VEGFR2 gene is located on chromosome 4q11-q12. The rs1870377 T/A functional polymorphism in exon 11 results in the replacement of histidine (His) with glutamine (Gln) at the receptor within the extracellular region, which is important for ligand binding [124]. The frequency of the VEGFR2 472Gln allele was significantly higher in long, middle and short distance swimmers compared to controls [125]. In another study, Eider et. al [126] found that while the VEGFR2 gene Gln/Gln genotype was associated with endurance performance among Polish endurance athletes, including longdistance swimmers, when long-distance swimmers were separated from other endurance-type sports, no statistically significant difference between swimmers and controls was found.
## (s14) Myostatin
Number of References: 12

(p14.0) Myostatin belongs to the transforming growth factor Î² super-family of proteins that control tissue growth and differentiation [181,182].

(p14.1) The myostatin (MSTN) gene is expressed almost exclusively in skeletal-muscle cells, and functions as a negative regulator of muscle growth. [183][184][185] In contrast, gene knockout [186] and inhibition of the gene signalling [181] lead to dramatic muscle hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia. The MSTN Lys(K)-153Arg(R) polymorphism (rs1805086, 2379 A > G replacement) influences skeletal muscle phenotypes [187]. The frequency of the mutant R allele (associated with lower myostatin levels) is about 3-4% among Caucasians, with a frequency of mutant homozygote (RR) below 1% [188][189][190]. A previous study [191] assessed the frequency of the MSTN Lys(K)-153Arg(R) polymorphism among elite Israeli track and field athletes and swimmers, and found that the MSTN 153R allele frequency was significantly higher among top-compared to national-level runners. This suggests the possible importance of the MSTN K153R polymorphism for excellence in both long-distance and sprint running. Interestingly, while the frequency of the MSTN 153R allele was significantly greater among long-compared to short-distance swimmers, none of the long-distance swimmers who carried the MSTN 153RR genotype was top level. Only a single short-distance swimmer carried the MSTN 153R allele, indicating that this polymorphism may not be significant for success in swimming, particularly in sprints.
