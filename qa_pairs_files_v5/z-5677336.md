## (s3) Peptide-Toxin Structure
Number of References: 21

(p3.0) KCN scorpion toxins vary in length from 23 to 64 AAs with estimated molecular weights usually less than 4000 Da. As highly constrained polypeptides they adhere to either the inhibitor cysteine knot or disulfide-directed β-hairpin folding motif [35]. Extensive research was required in initial toxin studies to determine primary AA sequence, pharmacological target and establish three-dimensional structure. Proteolytic enzymes have been used to assist in defining critical disulfide bridging, with Edman degradation providing the location of these bonding pairs-a major undertaking with any multiple-disulfide bond-containing constituent. This was only possible once purified target materials were available, as achieved by paper and/or column chromatography [36].

(p3.1) Initially, X-Ray Crystallography was one of the few techniques available for establishing intricate details regarding molecular conformation. Results were slow, as crystallization techniques required specialized training, together with large amounts of pure sample [37,38]. Studies have shown that using racemic mixtures of L-and D-peptides has enhanced the ability to crystallize peptide toxins, improving the quality of molecular models [39]. Soon after, the power of NMR spectroscopy was realized beyond the standard small-molecule/organic analysis, and its application in peptide structure determination was embraced [40]. Using multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz) it was determined that most scorpion peptide toxins adhere to a generalized α/β (scaffold) structural conformation that includes a characteristic number and location of α-helices and β-sheets [41][42][43][44]. Interestingly, using Maurotoxin (Scorpio maurus palmatus; MTX), Faljoun et al. showed that point mutations could be made which shifted the disulfide bridge framework, without altering the overall α/β scaffold of the toxin [45]. This revealed that the conserved α/β scaffold conformation was independent of toxin chain length, primary sequence and ion channel specificity, but importantly, that disulfide bridge patterns were paramount in tertiary structure stabilization and therefore pharmacological activity [45][46][47].

(p3.2) This was followed by the first computer based modeling, which was rudimentarily effective at predicting three dimensional structures by comparing homology sequences with previously defined toxin structures. Using graphics programs (i.e., FRODO), the quality of analysis was a reflection on the power of the hardware/software of the time, and not necessarily the data [38]. Advancement in both computer systems and modeling software has significantly impacted the quality of current models [48], which can now incorporate electrostatic distribution and structural constraints (See Figure 2), characteristics of paramount importance in receptor docking [49]. The modeling of bi-molecular interactions between toxin and receptor proves invaluable in establishing peptide templates for advanced probe bioengineering [50][51][52].  [49].
## (s6) Structure Activity Relationship

(p6.0) Defining a toxin's 3-Dimensional conformation, and further, the biologically active binding interface is an important part in understanding the structure activity relationship between toxin and receptor. This information becomes paramount when considering advanced peptide modifications and toxin bioengineering. Fundamentally, peptide toxins are short, single chain proteins interconnected by multiple disulfide bonds. The specific configuration of these disulfide bridges is indicative of compact folding and extraordinary molecular stability giving rise to target isoform selectivity and potency [42,47,71,103]. Several factors influence pharmacological activity in scorpion peptide toxins, these include: (i) primary sequence (encompassing charge and hydrophobic nature of residues); (ii) number and spacing of disulfide bridges; (iii) geometrical orientation of α-helices and β-sheets, and (iv) electrostatic and dipole orientation.
## (s10) Native Chemical Ligation
Number of References: 9

(p10.0) Native chemical ligation is a powerful synthetic strategy allowing peptide synthesis to move beyond the constraints of the standard length linear SPPS (~50-60 AAs) [147]. Proven by the chemical and semi-synthesis of large functional proteins (>10 kDa), including the ion channel KcsA [148,149], this strategy has also facilitated the incorporation of small synthetic peptide fragments into larger recombinant proteins, allowing the integration of various non-native AAs and fluorophore derivatives [39,150].

(p10.1) In the past, SPPS methodology has been partially restricted by the difficulty of ensuring complete N α -deprotection and AA acylation throughout a long peptide chain, especially in syntheses over 50 residues [151]. This limitation is mostly attributed to their length, hydrophobic nature and high degree of cysteine content. Alleviating these issues, native chemical ligation employs a C-terminal thioesterified peptide that is chemically ligated to a peptide bearing a free N-terminal cysteine, this occurring sequentially using small manageable size linear peptide blocks. This process was initially performed principally using Boc-SPPS [151], however Li and co-workers described a novel approach leading to the production of a peptide thioester via Fmoc-SPPS [152]. Unfortunately difficulties remained, as this method produced significant aminolysis of the primary peptide thioester species. Methodologies have been sequentially improved, demonstrated by the synthesis of the scorpion toxin II Hexapeptide [151].
## (s11) Peptide Backbone Cyclization
Number of References: 19

(p11.0) Scorpion toxin scaffolds specific for K + channels have tremendous potential in rational drug design and development [156], see Section 14. Unfortunately, they suffer from a number of disadvantages in vivo owing to their inherent peptidic structure including proteolytic and thermal degradation, as well as poor bioavailability. Peptide backbone cyclization, or N-to C-terminal ligation, is capable of dramatically increasing this therapeutic potential by minimizing aforementioned drawbacks [157,158]. To achieve this, several factors must be considered in regard to the toxin candidate including, (i) distance between termini; (ii) relative orientation of termini; (iii) flexibility of the termini; (iv) position of disulfide bonds and (v) understanding of key residues involved in biological activity or binding [159]. This bioengineering approach has thus far proven successful exemplified by the production of in vitro fluorescent probes [129], the design of therapeutic scaffolds for epitope chimerization [160], and the re-engineering of conotoxins for the treatment of neuropathic pain [161].

(p11.1) Naturally occurring in plants, animals and bacteria, circular peptides known as cyclotides are hypothesized as a natural component in host defense systems. Displaying a diverse range of biopharmaceutical properties including anti-HIV, antimicrobial and insecticidal activities [77], cyclotides are inherently stable, surmounting many of the primary obstacles observed when bioengineering peptides as potential drug therapies [159]. Structurally, cyclotides are comprised of a circular peptide backbone, and a disulfide framework commonly referred to as a cysteine knot motif [162,163]. Using techniques developed for native chemical ligation [164], several therapeutic, acyclic toxins have been cyclized, including the scorpion peptide CTX [158], and the χ-conotoxin MrIA, the latter of which has subsequently entered clinical trials as a potential treatment for neuropathic pain [165,166].

(p11.2) As with other peptide toxins, cyclotides can be bioconjugated to fluorescent moieties, however in this form N-terminal labeling is not possible and limitations are presented by the sterics of the parent sequence backbone. Potentially, topologically accessible lysine residues can be used, or can be inserted into functionally inert region of the parent sequence, as discussed in Section 9. Akcan et al. (2011) attempted to determine if fluorophore bioconjugation and cyclization of Chlorotoxin (CTX) would improve the stability of CTX bioconjugates by eliminating the accessibility of terminal AAs to circulating peptidases. Utilizing native chemical ligation, Cyclic-CTX was synthesized by Boc chemistry. A seven-residue linker (GAGAAGG) was required for cyclization (see Figure 4) due to the proximity of the termini (11.7 ± 1.5 Å) [129]. Glycine and alanine were chosen for the linker due to their small size, and based on the premise that side chain functionality would not perturb the native three-dimensional conformation of the parent peptide backbone. Later bioconjugation of near infrared fluorophores to create fluorescent probes increased serum stability of cyclic toxins from 70% to 90% (after a 24h incubation) [129].  [129].
## (s17) Hypertension
Number of References: 15

(p17.0) The Ca 2+ -activated K + channel, K Ca 1.1, from the gene slo, functionally regulates smooth muscle tone in pulmonary airways and vascular beds [5,169]. This is accomplished by facilitating feedback regulation against the rise of intracellular Ca 2+ , membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction that in turn promotes outward K + current, initiating membrane hyperpolarization [181]. Due to this regulatory role in vascular tone, K Ca 1.1 has been identified as a molecular target for the treatment of hypertension.

(p17.1) Scorpion toxins have been classified which act on K Ca 1.1, as first demonstrated by ChTx [6]. Unfortunately ChTx displays promiscuous behavior cross reacting with other KCN isoforms, making it less than ideal as a therapeutic candidate. Interestingly, two short chain scorpion toxins, IbTx [5], and BmTx3B [182], in addition to one long chain scorpion toxin BmP09 [183] are well documented, selective inhibitors of K Ca 1.1. While most long chain scorpion toxins are known to be specific for Na + channels, the sulfoxide produce by Met 66 in BmP09 induces a drastic shift in target specificity [183]. Chimeric bioengineering could elucidate structural characteristics responsible for this shift in specificity towards K Ca 1.1, creating a highly specific, and potent toxin scaffold that could hypothetically be cyclized for therapeutic application.

(p17.2) Other human pathologies have been associated with varying KCN isoforms including links between K V 1.1/2 and episodic ataxia, partial seizures and myokymia disorders [184], K V 3.4 and Alzheimer's [185], K V 7.2-7.5 and epilepsy [186], as well as K V 7.2-7.5 and the treatment of neuropathic pain [187], but are beyond the scope of this review. The link between these diseases and KCNs remains an important area of research and treatments are being investigated. Using some of the techniques highlighted here, various scorpion toxins (BTK-2 and OdK1, Episodic Ataxia [49,188]; sBmTX3, Alzheimer's [189]) could prove invaluable as molecular scaffolds for the development and bioengineering of molecular therapeutics for the treatment of these debilitating human pathologies.
