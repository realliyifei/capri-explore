(p5.0) Protection afforded by previous Vibrio cholerae infection: a review of subsequent cholera. Clemens and colleagues found, from records collected over 42 months, the age-adjusted incidence of cholera was 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21% to 81%) lower in those who had had cholera than in those who had not [12]. Ali and colleagues reached similar conclusions but specific to the El Tor biotype. Those who had El Tor cholera had a 65% (95% CI, 37% to 81%) lower risk of subsequent El Tor cholera, irrespective of age, that was sustained over 3 years-the full study duration of the study from Ali and colleagues [10]. These findings were supported by Glass and colleagues [11], who found repeat hospitalizations were 90% lower than expected (only 3 repeats compared to 29 as expected from a life-table analysis).

(p5.1) Analyzed further by biotype, Clemens and colleagues [12] found that El Tor cholera was associated with "suggestive" protection with subsequent El Tor cholera (29% lower; 95% CI, −118% to 77%) but not with classical cholera (−6% lower; 95% CI, −182% to 60%). Classical cholera was associated with protection against clinical cholera after finding no cases of subsequent cholera following an initial clinical infection with classical V. cholerae [12]. Similarly, Ali and colleagues [10] did not detect any subsequent clinical cholera among those diagnosed with a classical V. cholerae infection, but in their study, classical cholera patients made up less than 1% of all cholera patients detected.

(p5.2) Unlike the 3 aforementioned studies that analyzed data collected at medical centers [10][11][12], Woodward analyzed 6 years of surveillance data that were maintained by daily house-to- In records of cholera cases collected in Bangladesh between 1991 and 2000, Ali and colleagues [10] found, though not statistically significant, that initial O139 cholera was associated with a 63% (95% CI, −61% to 92%) lower risk of subsequent O139 cholera but no evidence of cross-protection between O1 and O139 serogroups.
