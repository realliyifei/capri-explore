(p0.0) Increasing burden of obesity, MetS, T2DM, and CVD in developing countries has created an urgent need for more researches on the various factors responsible for increasing their prevalence [1][2][3][4]. MetS has generated much concern over the past few years because it clearly represents a high risk for developing diabetes type 2 and cardiovascular diseases. Hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and physical inactivity are the main risk factors of MetS [5][6][7], but its association with other interrelated factors is still unknown.

(p0.1) Although it's suggested that the improvement of economic situation, nutrition transition, and increased urbanization in developing countries play the important roles in increasing prevalence of obesity and the MetS [1,[8][9][10][11][12][13], more researches is needed to confirm these suggestions. Greater efforts are also needed to properly diagnose other affecting environmental and genetic factors in order to find out the basic mechanisms which lead to the susceptibility of individuals to the MetS [14][15][16][17]. It is well documented now that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increasing worldwide. However, it seems that not only its prevalence in some geographic regions and ethnic groups is higher than others but also the patterns of its related components are widely different [18].
