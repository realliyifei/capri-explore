(p2.0) The task of comparing research contributions can be reviewed in light of the more general task of comparing resources (or entities) in a knowledge graph. While this is a well-known task in multiple domains (for instance in e-commerce systems [42]), not much work has focused on comparison in knowledge graphs, speci cally. One of the few works with this focus is by Petrova et al. [28] who created a framework for comparing entities in RDF graphs using SPARQL queries. In order to compare contributions, they rst have to be found. Finding is an information retrieval problem. As a well-known technique, TF-IDF [21] can be used for this task. More sophisticated techniques can be used to determine the structural similarity between graphs (e.g., [20]) and matching semantically similar predicates. This relates to dataset interlinking [1] or more generally ontology alignment [34]. For property alignment, techniques of interest include edit distance (e.g., Jaro-Winkler [41] or Levenshtein [19]) and vector distance. Gromann and Declerck [10] found that fastText [4] performs best for ontology alignment.
