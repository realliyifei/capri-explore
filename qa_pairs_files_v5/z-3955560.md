(p0.0) Selenium (Se) is a metalloid which plays important roles in plants, animals and human growth and development. It's an essential micronutrient for animals and humans but not yet established as an essential nutrient for plants. It has been estimated that approximately 3 billion people are Se deficient which makes them susceptible to health problems such as Keshan disease, Kashin-Beck disease and cancer [1,2]. The deficiency of Se has also been associated with occurrence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS in sub Saharan Africa [3]. Selenium deficiency has been reported in countries such as Canada, China, Scotland, Japan, Finland, New Zealand, Spain, and USA [2,[4][5][6][7]. A daily Se requirement of 55µg is recommended for adults by the National Academy of Science in the United States [8]. Daily intake of Se must not be greater than 400 µg in humans because Se can be toxic at high concentrations [9].
## (s3) Parent Rocks

(p3.0) Weathering of parent rocks is one of the fundamental processes involved in soil formation. Parent rocks are composed of various trace elements, most of which exist as ores and are released into the soil by physical and chemical weathering. Trace element concentrations in the soil have been found to be related to the parent material [21]. For example, a past study has shown that the average contents of Se in soil profile increased with the Se contents in parent material [22]. Selenium concentrations in the soil vary with type of parent material from which it is formed. Jurassic siltstones and sandstones are generally low in Se, whereas high concentrations occur in areas underlain by Permian carbonaceous strata [23]. Igneous rocks usually have low concentrations of Se while Se concentrations of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks are variable [24]. Selenium tends to be lower in intrusive igneous rocks due to its volatile nature but abundant in extrusive rocks such as basalt and ash [25]. High concentrations of Se are present in clay rich sedimentary rocks such as mudstones and shales because of the affinity of Se for clay minerals [26][27].

(p3.1) It has been reported that soils overlying black shales and slates have Se concentration twice that from nearby limestone and phyllites in Korea [28]. A small amount of Se is incorporated into the lattice of pyrite (Iron sulfide, FeS 2 ) by isomorphous substitution in carbonaceous siliceous rocks and carbonaceous shales (stone coal). The weathering of Se sulfides results in the formation of native Se. There are three types of native Se in these rocks based on their origin; first type occurs in carbonaceous-siliceous rocks and the tiny Se crystals formed during tectonic activity; the second is the Se found in the weathered carbonaceous siliceous rocks and highly carbonaceous mudstones; and the third, crystalline Se within the near-surface of abandoned stone coal spoils, which was derived from natural combustion ofstone coal [29].
## (s15) Plant Uptake of Selenium

(p15.0) Plants can be classified into three main groups based on the Se concentrations in their tissues; non accumulators, accumulators and hyperaccumulators. Non Se accumulating plants rarely contain greater than 50 mg kg -1 Se and often have less than 5 mg kg -1 Se in their tissues [26]. Accumulators can be further divided into two groups; primary and secondary accumulators. Primary Se accumulators grow well on soils with high available Se concentrations and contain up to 1000 mg kg -1 Se [26,118]. Secondary Se accumulators are plant species such as Atriplex, Castilleja, Grindelia, and Gutierrezia, which do not contain more than 50 to 100 mg Se kg -1 [26]. Se hyperaccumulators contain between 1000-15000 mg kg -1 Se and examples include Astragalus bisulcatus and Stanleya pinnata [119][120].

(p15.1) Hyperaccumulating plants are commonly used for removal of contaminants from contaminated soils, sediments and water in a process referred to as 'phytoremediation'. Three different types of phytoremediation technologies have been used for Se; phytoextraction, phytovolatilization and rhizofiltration. In phytoextraction, Se is removed by plants from contaminated soils while in phytovolatilization, Se is converted to gaseous forms which are consequently removed from the soil plant system while rhizofiltration utilizes plant roots to remove Se from contaminated water. Plants such as Indian mustard (Brassica juncea Czern. L.) and canola (Brassica napus cv. Westar) have been used for the phytoextraction of contaminated soils in on farm trials. Canola removed nearly all extractable selenium from farm plots after 90 days while Indian mustard reduced the total soil Se content by almost 50% at a depth of up to 75 cm after 3 years [121][122]. Plants with high rates of Se volatilization includes rice and hybrid poplars which can be used in phytovolatilization [123][124]. Several aquatic plants have been used for the rhizofiltration of Se from wastewater in constructed wetland soils [125].
## (s16) Transport Within Plants
Number of References: 15

(p16.0) Due to similarities, selenateand sulfate anions both compete for plant uptake and are both probably taken upvia a sulfate transporter in the root plasma membrane while selenite uptake occurs via phosphate transporters [134][135]. Previously, it was believed that selenite absorption by plant roots occurs via passive transport while absorption of selenate and organic forms of Se occurs via active transport [134][135]. However, recent studies have shown that selenite transport can also occur via active transport [137][138].

(p16.1) Selenium is transported to the leaves first before accumulation in the seed or fruits in Se accumulator plants while in non Se accumulators, Se accumulation in the roots is the same as that of the seeds or grains [139]. However, Se concentration in seeds of the Se hyperaccumulator, Astragalus bisulcatus, was much higher (Table 3) than the roots and leaves while the seeds had a higher concentration than the roots in Stanley pinnata [140]. A recent study has shown that the Se contents in roots and stems of soybeans were higher than those in the fruits during the whole soybean growing period [141]. This agrees with the findings of a past study on 17 vegetables which reported that Se concentrations of edible parts were lower than non edible parts [142]. [143] explained that selenite is transported by symplastic mechanism whereas selenate is transported by the apoplastic mechanism in onions. Selenite absorbed into the cytoplasm through the apoplastic mechanism is transformed into selenide, whereas selenate movement involves an inert transport via the microcapillaries in the root peripheral tissues toward the other parts without the infiltration of selenium compounds inside the cell and without being transformed into other chemical forms. This may explain why selenate is more easily transported than other forms of Se within the plant system [144]. Selenite usually accumulates in the plant roots because it is not easily translocated within the plant and is converted easily into organic forms. Past studies have reported lower Se concentrations in leaves of onion and broccoli plants exposed to selenite compared with selenate [145][146]. A recent study has also reported that addition of selenate to the soil increased rice grain Se concentrations more than selenite [14].
## (s21) Anti-oxidative and Pro-oxidative Effects
Number of References: 10

(p21.0) Plants produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals under both biotic and abiotic stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) includes superoxide anion, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl free radical and hydrogen peroxide [158]. One major source of ROS in plants is the generation of oxygen in the chloroplast during photosynthesis. Mitochondria and peroxisomes are other sources of ROS in plants. When the production of ROS exceeds the ability of the plants to eliminate them, plants undergo oxidative stress; excess ROS can damage cellular lipids, proteins or DNA, inhibit signal transduction pathways, and disturb normal cellular function [159]. Selenium has been shown to increase tolerance of plants against oxidative stress by decreasing lipid peroxidation and increasing the activity of anti-oxidative enzymes when applied in small concentrations [160][161].

(p21.1) Plants possess both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense system which is able to protect plant cells from oxidative damage by quenching ROS. Enzymatic anti-oxidative enzymes include superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione peroxidase, (GPX), guaiacol peroxidase (GOPX) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Non-enzymatic antioxidants include ascorbic acid, glutathione, (GSH), phenolic compounds, alkaloids, non-protein amino acids and a-tocopherols [162]. SOD removes the superoxide radicals by catalyzing its dismutation while other enzymatic antioxidants such as CAT and APX are involved in the removal of hydrogen peroxide. Ascorbic acid scavenges the superoxide radicals while GSH is a potential scavenger of singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. Proline is a scavenger of singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals while carotenoids and tocopherols are involved with scavenging of singlet oxygen [162].

(p21.2) Conversely, high concentrations of Se can also lead to oxidative stress in plants in which case Se acts as a pro-oxidant [163]. [164] suggested that this may be due to an imbalance in the levels of GSH, thiols, ferredoxins and NADPH which control assimilation of Se at high concentrations. They explained that if these substances are not present in sufficient amounts to assimilate high concentrations of Se, it could lead to oxidative stress.

(p21.3) However, selenite-induced high levels of hydrogen peroxide has been observed in the leaf discs of Senecio scandens Lwhich did not happen with selenate when applied at the same dosage [165]. This implies that the pro-oxidative effects of Se may be dependent on its chemical form or speciation. Three mechanisms have been proposed for the toxic effects of Se in plants; first, generation of superoxide radicals, secondly, substitution of Se for S in proteins and thirdly, inhibition of methylation [166].
## (s24) Senescence Delay

(p24.0) Senescence, the process of aging in plants, can be either stress induced or developmental. Senescence is the final stage of leaf development which occurs in response to internal and external signals [196]. Leaf senescence plays important roles in plant development by recycling nutrients to vigorously growing organs [197][198]. The concentrations of 58 elements including major, minor and rare earth elements increased during the course of beech leaf senescence and decomposition in a Swedish beech forest [199]. The role of Se in plant senescence is very clear from numerous studies conducted on several crops. The effect of Se on lettuce senescence was studied in pot experiments at different Se concentrations [160]. At low Se concentrations, Se reduced senescence-induced lipid peroxidation and enhanced the growth of senescent lettuce by 14%. Total tocopherols (vitamin E) decreased during senescence, but Se counteracted their decrease and improved the nutritive value of lettuce. Selenium increased the activity of GPX and SOD activity in young and senescing plants [160]. Similar results were obtained with soybeans where Se delayed senescence by increasing activities of SOD and GPX [190].
## (s25) Reduced Herbivory
Number of References: 7

(p25.0) Plants employ several tactics for defending against herbivory, ranging from physical structures to chemical defenses that are produced within the plant [204]. One of the potential benefits of selenium accumulation in Se hyperaccumulators is the protection of plants from a wide variety of herbivores, including vertebrates and invertebrates based on both deterrence and toxicity [205][206]. Selenium protected Se-hyperaccumulating plants from herbivory by arthropods and arthropod species than comparable non-hyperaccumulators growing in the same seleniferous habitat [207]. Selenium also protected two Se-hyperaccumulator species, Astragalus bisulcatus and S. pinnata, from cell-disrupting herbivores such as western flower thrips and two-spotted spider mites [119]. Even Se-richneighbors of hyperaccumulators experienced less herbivory and caused higher grasshopper Se accumulation and mortality [208]. Herbivory by birds and aphids was reduced on Se-treated radish plants, indicating a potential reproductive advantage for the plant [209].
