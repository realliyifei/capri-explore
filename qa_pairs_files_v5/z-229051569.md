(p2.0) Vehicles have very distinctive features, textures in the study of salient image features. This nature makes it possible to conduct vehicle detection based on pattern recognition methods. In order to learn these features, the researchers relied on several feature extraction methods for feature extraction. Among them, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature [12], Haar feature [13], and local binary pattern (LBP) are standard extraction operators. These three features are not specifically designed for vehicle detection, but based on the vehicle's image features and statistical method learning, the study shows that these features apply to the vehicle detection algorithm.
