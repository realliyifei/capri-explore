(p3.0) Camel milk is unlike other ruminants milk, with low cholesterol, low sugar, high minerals, (sodium, potassium, iron, zinc, and magnesium), high vitamin C, low protein, and a large concentration of insulin [18]. Furthermore, the milk composition of the dromedary camel is great from a dietary perspective. Different authors are argued that composition of camel milk varies due to difference of geographical origin and year of publication of the published data's but other factors such as the physiological stage, feeding conditions, seasonal or physiological variations, genetic or health status of the camel have also paramount importance [19]. The most minimal substance of fat was recorded in the fifth month of lactation, which compared with the lactation top [20]. According to [21], It is likewise found that the normal fat% and SNF% between two age bunch are 3.35±0.07 and 4.37±0.70, 8.34±0.24 and 9.17±0.49, individually and the distinctions were found exceptionally critical. Camel milk is made out of lactose, fat, and protein is generally a similar extent as cow milk [6].

(p5.0) Camel milk is a significant segment of the human diet routine in numerous parts of the world [14]. Whereas the commitments rendered by dromedary camels are milk production and transportation [24]. However, the contribution of camel milk to family unit nourishment admission is critical during the dry season [16]. The camel milk is a profoundly nutritious item giving a perfect situation to the development of various and complex microbial populations. These bacterial populaces are principally gathered into two significant classifications: (i) advantageous and innovatively pertinent microscopic organisms and (ii) pathogenic and waste microorganisms. Nowadays, a couple of studies depend on the way of life subordinate methodologies have been led on the recognizable proof of the bacterial populaces of camel milk [15,25].
