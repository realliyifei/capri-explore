(p1.0) Although there is currently no evidence that P in commercial cat foods induces renal disease in healthy cats, high "ash" content in food might be a risk factor for developing CKD. 86 Ash refers to all the minerals in food, and this includes P but is not specifically correlated to it. In that study, higher intakes of dietary fiber, magnesium and sodium all were associated with reduced risk for CKD. Each of these nutrients can impact dietary P availability. Another small study suggests that increased P and protein intakes might be associated with CKD in cats. 81 Studies in healthy cats show an impact of dietary P, or inverse Ca : P ratios, on markers of kidney function. 19,20,87,88  phosphates. 20 The amount of phosphorus from highly soluble monosodium phosphate was approximately 0.4 g/Mcal ME or 0.17% of diet DM, in a diet with a Ca : P ratio of approximately 0.4 : 1.
