(p6.0) In creating space for autistic users, the safety aspect is crucially important since they have less awareness of danger and often show unexpected behavior [11]. Safety is mentioned as the most important concern in planning space for autistic students [11]. A room should not allow individuals with an autism spectrum disorder to harm their selves or others [10]. Physical hazards such as sharp edges and corners in a room are the example of safety consideration [23]. Considering its function to release maladaptive behavior, a quiet room should provide enough safety to prevent injuries that might happen due to aggressive behavior.
