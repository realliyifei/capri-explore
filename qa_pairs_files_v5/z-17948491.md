## (s7) Motivation for categorisation
Number of References: 7

(p7.0) Much research exists detailing the advantages and disadvantages of categorisation vs. analysing variables continuously (Appendix 2). From a statistical viewpoint, categorisation of a continuous variable can often result in a loss of statistical efficiency [4][5][6]. Some authors [10,11] advise against the practice of categorisation irrespective of the number of categories. More practical considerations, however, may favour categorisation for ease of interpretation of parameter estimates, their presentation to less statistically-minded public health professionals, and may be motivated by use of clinically relevant 'cut points' if they exist. Categorisation is often used in conjunction with a continuous analysis, for example, to check for, or model, non-linear effects. Some authors [12,13] have advocated the use of alternative, more flexible modelling approaches using the continuous variable such as spline regression modelling and generalised additive models to model non-linear outcome-exposure relationships, which avoid the need to categorise. Such modelling approaches are more statistically complex which may limit their wide-spread use, and can pose difficulties of interpretation e.g. is statistical uncertainty adequately expressed, and does the model extrapolate beyond the observed range of the data.
