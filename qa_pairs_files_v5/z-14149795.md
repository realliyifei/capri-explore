(p19.0) Several studies mainly focused on the integration of RES and how far it could provide power and energy balancing and flattening the daily load profile.Rotering and Ilic (2011) and Ma et al. (2012) used intelligent charging and discharging methods to emphasize previously discussed issues.Other researchers, such as Khodayar et al. (2012), integrated EVs and wind energy in a power system by using a specific model called Stochastic SCUC.Nevertheless, challenges and hindrance sexist when integrating V2G concept by determining benefits and other issues, such as profits.All of these aspects were revealed and elaborated by Mullan et al. (2012) and Yilmaz and Krein (2013).Some studies mainly focused on exposing the most optimal techniques for allocating power to each of PHEV that go to the charging station (Rahman et al., 2014).Shaaban and El-Saadany (2014) proposed a multi-objective planning algorithm that confers the capability of adapting scenarios of high penetration of EVs, along with the injection of renewable distributed generation.The main contributions of the study were developing a probabilistic annual model of energy consumption for a fleet of EVs based on the Monte Carlo simulation and investigation of renewable distributed interaction units along with the requirements of EV load.Another research study presented the expected impact of EVs by considering probability of occurrence (Elnozahy et al., 2014).Fazelpour et al. (2014) also proposed an optimization method to assess integrating PHEV RES by using genetic algorithms.The result indicated a noticeable alleviation in real power losses and improvement of voltage profile in the distribution lines.
