(p5.0) Three studies consisting of 426 patients were identified investigating the natural history of lumbar disk herniation with radiculopathy. Vroomen et al prospectively studied 183 patients with sciatica who were randomly assigned to bed rest or normal activities. 7 The authors found that 70% (64/92) of patients assigned to bed rest and 65% (59/91) of patients assigned to normal activities improved within 2 weeks and that 87% (80/92 patients and 79/91 patients, respectively) of both groups improved by 12 weeks. Improvements were based on subjective patient and investigator perception, and the two different nonoperative treatment techniques failed to yield statistically significant differences. Weber and colleagues prospectively studied 208 patients with acute sciatica who were treated with 1 week of bed rest and found that 70% (146/208) of patients had symptom improvement (as measured by visual analog scale and Roland's functional tests) within 4 weeks. 8 Hakelius assessed 38 patients with sciatica who were treated conservatively with bed rest, a corset, and physical therapy. 9 At 24 weeks, the author estab-lished that 88% (33/38) of the patients were symptom-free based on patient perception (â–ºTable 1).
