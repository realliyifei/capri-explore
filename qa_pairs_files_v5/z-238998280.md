(p10.0) This process involves microencapsulating the main excipient material by dissolving or dispersing it in the polymer coating solution. Further by agitation process the core material blend is distributed all over the vehicle phase to get the proper size and shape microcapsules. Then heating the above mixture results in evaporation of the solvent. On evaporation of the solvent, the liquid vehicle temperature is decreased to ambient room temperature by continuous agitation process. The core excipient materials can be either water insoluble or watersoluble materials [23]. This process is used in preparation of liquid manufacturing vehicles. The coating excipient is solubilized in a volatile solvent, which is immiscible with the liquid manufacturing vehicles [16].
