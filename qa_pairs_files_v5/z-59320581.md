## (s5) Multiphysical Properties of Hempcrete
Number of References: 75

(p5.0) Hempcrete is a mixture, in very changeable proportions, of two very different components: a plant-based granulate and a hydraulic and aerated setting binder. It exhibits multiphysical behaviour which is unusual in the domain of construction materials. Indeed, the particles of hemp wood are characterized by a high degree of porosity which results in a high capacity to deform, absorb sounds and have hygrothermal transfer ability: this is one of the essential characteristics which set hempcretes apart from tradition mineral-based concretes for which the granulates are considered non-deformable. This difference has major effects on the performances of these concretes in all areas (acoustic, thermal [66], etc.), and of course, it has a direct impact on the mechanical properties of these innovative concretes [66,67]. The aim of this part is to show why and how these concretes are distinguished from conventional concretes, and in particular to establish the properties of use and the characteristic values necessary for their use in construction.
