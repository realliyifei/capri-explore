(p13.0) In the study by Prendergast and Maggie (2013), a key finding was that because sponsors had a close knowledge of and relationship with the child, and strongly believed that the money was directly impacting the lives of the children, the sponsors expressed concern "about the impact on the children if sponsorship was withdrawn" (p. 138). In some cases, the sponsors admitted to sustaining their sponsorship because they felt guilty and did not want to damage/lose the close relationship with the child.
