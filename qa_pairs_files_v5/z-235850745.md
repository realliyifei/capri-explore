(p0.0) A smart city is an urban area that uses remote sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) enabling technologies to collect data from different locations and uses to enhance the quality of life of the people. The low power, low data rate wireless sensor networks (WSN) are used for monitoring and control applications in smart cities. The WSN nodes are used as the underlying technology infrastructure in the IoT. In the IoT, the "things" refer to the tiny embedded physical sensing devices (i.e., WSN nodes) connected to the internet to perform a specific application. Currently, a new revolutionary technique known as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is evolving as the future of fully automated IoT applications. Machine learning is a part of AI, in which, the computer algorithms learn by themselves by improving from past experiences. A detailed survey of ML algorithms was performed in [1] until the year 2013. As the ML and IoT, technologies are emerging rapidly, therefore, the authors extend their survey work also. The IoT applications in smart cities are smart traffic monitoring [2], smart grids [3], smart waste management [4], smart agriculture [5], smart medical healthcare [6], etc. Table 1 provides a full form of all important abbreviations used in this paper. The major problems in WSN based IoT (WSN-IoT) are fully autonomous operation, maximum network lifetime, energy efficiency, quality of service (QoS), cross-layer optimization, high bandwidth requirement, sensor data analysis, cloud computing, communication protocol design, etc. Currently, the industrial IoT (IIoT) or industry 4.0 is the biggest revolution for smart industries, smart manufacturing sector, automobile sector, smart cities and medical healthcare sector. Worldwide, various major companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are working on the development of AI and ML-based algorithms in advanced IoT applications for smart cities.

## (s12) Routing Layer Issues
Number of References: 4

(p12.0) The processing for sending the data packets from one node to another via intermediate nodes is called routing. In the routing process, long routing tables are maintained by the gateway nodes, which consists of the source and destination address of all the packets in the network. In WSN, the sensed data is sent towards the main gateway node by the end nodes. If the routing path is very long then unnecessary energy is wasted in a WSN network. Therefore, smart routing algorithms need to be designed carefully to find the optimal routes between end node and gateway nodes. Several machine learning techniques such as decision tree, random forest, ANN, SVM and Bayesian learning are used to find the optimal path in WSNs [33].

Number of References: 4

(p14.0) In a smart city, thousands of small sensor nodes are deployed to measure the same physical quantity, e.g., temperature, humidity, light, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) gases, etc. Several sensors may report the same information to the gateway. This large amount of data is difficult to handle by the gateway. Therefore, sensor data aggregation is important in WSNs for smart city applications. Data aggregation means collecting and summarizing useful information from multiple sources. In this process, the data redundancy and data accuracy are improved. Data aggregation saves the power consumption of WSN nodes and hence improves the network lifetime also. Machine learning is useful for data aggregation. The cluster aggregates the data from the cluster head and transmits it to the base station. ML techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and quality (Q)-learning algorithms are useful for data aggregation tasks in WSN-IoT [35].
