(p5.0) For individuals, the function of immune system will change with age.[37] Jabal et al described the trend of anti-S protein IgG levels with age in 514 Israeli medical personnel on day 21 after the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.The results showed that IgG antibodies were detected in 475 (92%) of the vaccinated population, with a geometric mean concentration of 68.6 AU/mL.However, the 39 non-responders to the first dose of vaccine were older (median, 57 years), which was significantly different from the responders (median, 45 years) (P < .001).Moreover, antibody titers were found to decrease with age in antibody responders (P < .001).This trend still existed even when excluding previously infected respondents (P < .001). [38]In addition, a similar study by Tsatsakis et al also showed that an older age was associated with the lower the antibody titers (P < .001). [39]owever, Watanabe et al conducted a multifactorial antibody titer study in 86 healthcare workers (median, 29 years) in Rome who received 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 2021.The blood samples were taken for analysis of antibodies against the S protein.Multivariate analysis of the study showed that antibody titer was independent of age (P > .05). [40]he differences in the above analysis results might be related to different research methods, the number of people included in the study, and different quantitative indicators.In addition, the subjects in Watanabe et al study were young and had a small age span, which might lead to incomplete analysis of the age factor results.
