## (s4) Botrytis cinerea
Number of References: 16

(p4.0) Under favourable conditions, Botrytis cinerea Pers. (Bc), the anamorph of Botryotinia fuckeliana (de Bary) Whetzel, causes the devastating grey mould disease on tomato. This ascomycete belongs to the cosmopolitan Botrytis genus (family Sclerotiniaceae), which infects over 200 host plants cultivated both in greenhouse and field, including ornamental and wild species [93]. Bc may cause yield losses of tomato in some countries of the Mediterranean region, both under protected cultivation and in open field, although the damages occurring inside greenhouses are more serious [94][95][96]. Tomato yield loss accounts to around 20% [20,97], but it may reach up to 40% under optimal environmental conditions (mild temperatures between 15 and 20 • C and relative humidity above 90%) [18]. Severe infections might also develop under protected conditions when combinations of high temperature (25 • C), stem wounds, and high concentration of air-borne conidia occur [20].

(p4.1) The typical symptoms caused on tomato by Bc are soft rots, water soaking of parenchyma tissues, and grey masses of conidia ( Figure 3), while stem lesions may lead to complete plant collapse [98,99].

(p4.2) The most sensitive organs, such as stems, flowers, and fruits, may be infected through cultivation and pruning practices or by direct fungus penetration [100][101][102]. Conversely, soft rots of ripe tomato fruits occur mainly in post-harvest, while "ghost spot" symptoms related to a host defence response against this pathogen can arise on unripe fruits, making them hardly marketable [99].

(p4.3) Transmission of this necrotrophic fungus occurs mainly through air-borne conidia originating from infected plants of tomato or other hosts, or through plant debris [101], while no evidence of seed-transmission has been reported. Bc may overwinter as sclerotia in the soil and in decayed plant residues that will last till the following growing season [103].
## (s14) Cucumber Mosaic Virus

(p14.0) Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is the type member of the genus Cucumovirus of the family Bromoviridae [232]. The virions are constituted of three icosahedral particles with a diameter of about 29 nm. The CMV genome is composed of three segments of positive single-stranded RNA, called RNA-1, RNA-2, and RNA-3. Another RNA molecule, called RNA-4, is generated by RNA-3. RNA1 encodes the 1a protein, which, together with the RNA-2-encoded 2a protein, forms the replicase complex; RNA-2 also encodes a second protein, 2b, which is involved with the long-distance movement. RNA-3 encodes two proteins, 3a, a cell-to-cell movement protein (MP), and 3b, the coat protein (CP), which facilitates cell-to-cell movement and virus transmission [233]. Some particular virus strains support the replication of a fifth non-genomic RNA segment called Carna 5, a satellite RNA that can modify symptom expression [234]. The presence of numerous CMV strains with a high genetic variability is thought to explain the extremely wide variety of symptoms that can make diagnosis difficult in some cases.

(p14.1) Currently, according to serological and molecular characteristics, all strains are grouped into two subgroups: Cucumber mosaic virus subgroup I-strain Fny (CMV-Fny) and subgroup II-strain Q (CMW-Q). Furthermore, subgroup I is divided into IA and IB [235]. Specifically, subgroup IA includes isolates that induce a generalized mosaic, while subgroup IB includes all the Asian isolates that induce necrotic lesions on leaves. Being a very adaptable virus with high evolutionary capacity, CMV may infect more than 1200 plant species and may be transmitted by more than 80 aphid species in a circulative, non-persistent manner [236,237]. Transmission efficiency varies according to the aphid species, virus strain, host species, and environmental conditions. In particular, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer), cotton or melon aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover), black bean aphid (A. fabae Scop.), cowpea aphid (A. craccivora Koch.), and potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae Thomas) are the most efficient vectors. Moreover, CMV can also be transmitted by seeds [238] and through ten species of dodder.
## (s17) Tomato Mosaic Virus

(p17.0) Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is the second economically important tomato infecting virus within the genus Tobamovirus (family Virgaviridae). ToMV consists of rigid and rod-shaped particles measuring approximately 300 × 15 nm. Its genome consists of a non-segmented single-stranded positive RNA (ssRNA+) molecule of approximately 6.380 nt [232]. The genome encodes four proteins, among which the 184 and 126 kDa proteins are involved in viral replication. The 184 kDa protein is the only protein required for virus replication, whereas the 126 kDa protein contains a methyltransferase and a helicase domain and increases the efficiency of replication. The ORFs positioned at the 3 -end of the genomic RNA encode the movement protein (MP), involved in the cell-to-cell movement, and the coat protein (CP) [263]. The virions can be found in all plant organs, including the pollen and seeds, probably except from the embryo.

(p17.1) ToMV is spread throughout the Mediterranean region and other areas where tomato is cultivated [281][282][283][284]. It can infect several different species, but its main hosts belong to the family Solanaceae, mainly tomato and pepper plants, where the yield can undergo reduction between 25-70% [55,56].
## (s18) Parietaria Mottle Virus
Number of References: 3

(p18.0) Parietaria mottle virus (PMoV) was identified and characterised for the first time in 1987 in the Turin area (Piedmont region of Italy) on Parietaria officinalis L. plants that showed a marked leaf mottling [292]. A variant of the virus, named TI-1 (Tomato-Ilarvirus-1), was identified in 1971 on tomato plants in the same geographical area [293]. PMoV is a member of the genus Ilarvirus within the family Bromoviridae. It has a single tripartite positive RNA genome; the RNA1 is monocistronic and encodes the protein 1a, whereas the RNA2 is bicistronic and encodes a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (protein 2a), and the protein 2b, which is expressed through a subgenomic RNA (RNA4). The RNA3 (2.700 nt) is bicistronic and encodes the movement protein (MP) and the coat protein (CP). The 1a and 2a proteins are involved in genome replication and internal transcription of the subgenomic RNA4 (1.100 nt) [294]. PMoV is constantly detected on tomatoes in some Mediterranean countries, such as Spain, France and Greece [58]. The disease incidence varies between 3 and 30%, but it is possible that up to now the real PMoV incidence has been underestimated, due to the confusion generated by similar symptoms caused by other viruses (TSWV, ToMV and CMV).
