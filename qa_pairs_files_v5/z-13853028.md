(p11.0) We suggest that a screening procedure which consists of two questionnaires, should be used in order to properly assess the second criteria of the diagnosis of DCD; the first one is addressed to the parents/caretakers, whereas the second to the teachers. Different questionnaires should be employed to cover the different motor functions of children capable at different ages. Motor items that require less of the child's attention should also be assessed in the early stages. Furthermore, as mentioned by van der Linde et al. [28][29][30][31], questionnaires and an objective measure of the activities should be administered.
