(p1.0) This review was prospectively registered in PROS-PERO (Registration Number: CRD42021209994), and reported in line with PRISMA 2020 guidance [18] and the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool [19]. For each database, a date limit of 2012-2023 was set. When available, subject headings identified from the controlled vocabulary of each database were also included in the search. On January 11 th 2023, a Google Scholar search was conducted for the search term 'Paternal preconception' , applying the filter to limit articles published since 2022 and searching through to page seven, identifying any other recently published relevant papers. Google Scholar was also used to identify relevant studies citing each included paper. Reference lists of each included paper were then checked for additional relevant studies.

(p13.0) Six papers examined alcohol as an exposure [26,42,43,[55][56][57]; three rated as good quality [42,55,56]. Excluding one, each paper used paternal self-reports of alcohol consumption with varying definitions; one article specified units/per week [43], the others assessed consumption more broadly either as intake ≥ 1/week [56], ≥ 1/month [42] or general intake [57]. A single study presented a maternal report of paternal preconception alcohol consumption, 3 months before conception, at 12-16 weeks gestation [55].

(p13.1) When examining an outcome of offspring anogenital distance (AGD), in the paternal alcohol-exposed group (> 81 g/wk), male offspring had shorter mean AGDs [56]; for AGD-AP [the centre of the anus to the cephalad insertion of the penis] at birth (β =-1.73, P = 0.04) and 12 months (β = -7.29, P = 0.05), and shorter mean AGD-AS [the centre of the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum] at 6 months (β =-4.91, P = 0.02) [56]. Female offspring had shorter mean AGD-AF [ the centre of the anus to the posterior convergence of the fourchette) (β = -0.72, P = 0.02) at birth yet longer mean AGD AC [the centre of the anus to the clitoris] (β = 2.81, P = 0.04) and AGD-AF (B = 1.91, P = 0.04) at 12 months [56]. Further, the relative risks of anxiety or depression were increased by 33% (RR = 1.33 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.61]) and 37% (RR = 1.37 [95% CI: 1.02,1.84]) among girls in the exposed group at ages 4 and 6, respectively [55]. Paternal alcohol consumption greater than once per month was not associated with offspring birthweight or gestational age [42].
