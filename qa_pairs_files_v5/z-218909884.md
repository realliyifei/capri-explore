(p0.0) Knee arthroplasty is becoming more common as the prevalence of osteoarthritis and life expectancy increases. [1]. Depending on the extent of joint disease, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) can be applied and both approaches have advantages in long-term survivorship and functional outcomes [2,3]. Orthopedic surgeons have difficulty deciding a method of treatment for young and active patients [4]. UKA has many theoretical advantages, such as the preservation of bone stock, a more rapid recovery and rehabilitation, and better functional results. Furthermore, UKA has the advantages of the conservation of anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and normal kinematics [5]. However, UKA is required to a delicate surgical method, and in some cases, malalignment of the components has caused poor post-operative functions and early revisions [6,7]. To improve the accuracy of implanted component alignment, computer-assisted surgery systems have been developed [8,9]. In addition, TKA becomes a gold-standard treatment for patients Table 1.

(p8.0) As TKA became more popular with the loss of joint function and knee OA treatment, investigating the method for accuracy, reproducibility, and the effectiveness of the procedure has become crucial in modern orthopedic studies with patient-specific TKA showing potential [68,69]. As previously mentioned, developing a custom knee arthroplasty requires advanced imaging techniques, either CT or MRI, to obtain the patient's specific anatomy of the hip, distal femur, proximal tibia, and ankle [70]. Through this process, individualized implants can be developed by matching the geometry of the patient's tibial plateau and femoral condyles. This model was designed to maintain knee stability at all movement levels while simultaneously maintaining a neutral mechanical axis and maintaining a constant relationship between joint points across the range of motion [71,72]. The implant that considers the coronal radii of the trochlear groove and condyles is designed to reduce polyethylene wear. This design can lead to the lowest possible contact stresses [73]. In addition, Buller et al. found that custom knee joint surgery needs thinner cross-sections to perform rotation and a custom-fit, allowing for bone stock preservation. This process permits the replacement (from a surface perspective) of exactly what was cut (from a shape perspective). On the tibial side, different sizes of medial and lateral inserts have the advantage of matching the femoral offset while restoring the tibial plateau angle of the normal knee [70]. This study also shows that for the facilitating of the natural femoral rollback during the knee flexion, the medial insert is more conforming [70]. To achieve this level of precision, implant systems of custom TKA are manufactured with a custom-cutting instrument for placing the components exactly. In the prior TKA approach, surgeons had limitations related to kinematics due to anatomy variations of the patient. The mechanical axis is restored by custom TKA through a method requiring perpendicular cuts. By using an anatomical implant with an asymmetric thickness, restoration of the joint line and the normal knee kinematics is possible. Fundamentally, custom TKA merges the benefits of two major strategies of condylar knee design.

(p8.1) Currently, patient-specific knee arthroplasty systems are manufactured by ConforMIS in the United States, BodyCAD in Canada, and Symbios in Switzerland. In patient-specific TKA, the design of the tibial insert is developed using the articular geometry obtained from the femoral component [33]. The complete design of patient-specific UKA is based on the variability in the femoral component's coronal curvature, which may cause point loading in specific flexion angles when using a curved tibial insert [74]. To resolve the problem, a flat polyethylene tibial component has to be considered in conjunction with a constant coronal curvature of the femoral component to ensure constant loading conditions over a large surface regardless of the flexion angle when the tibial insert is designed [74]. In other words, the tibial insert in the current patient-specific knee arthroplasty design cannot perfectly preserve the tibial plateau curvature. In the native knee, however, the medial tibial plateau has slightly dished geometry and the lateral is convex (Figure 2) [75].

In other words, the tibial insert in the current patient-specific knee arthroplasty design cannot perfectly preserve the tibial plateau curvature. In the native knee, however, the medial tibial plateau has slightly dished geometry and the lateral is convex (Figure 2) [75]. Additionally, the medial and lateral menisci are considerably different in their biomechanics [76,77]. The medial meniscus has significantly less movement than the lateral meniscus because of its attachment to the medial collateral ligament and larger insertion areas. Thus, the medial meniscus affects joint stability more than the lateral meniscus, which closely follows the AP excursion of the femur [76,77]. The dished medial plateau and the greater stability of the medial meniscus restrict the AP motion and posterior rollback of the medial femoral condyle. On the contrary, the convex lateral plateau and the lateral meniscus mobility enable a greater range of AP motion with a greater posterior rollback of the lateral femoral condyle. Therefore, in high flexion activities, such as a deep-knee-bend, the knee shows an overall medial pivot motion with a greater rollback of the lateral femoral condyle [78,79]. However, it is important to note that the medial tibia does not completely constrain the medial femoral condyle. Accordingly, during limited flexion activities, such as climbing stairs, the AP motion of the medial condyle may be similar to the motion Additionally, the medial and lateral menisci are considerably different in their biomechanics [76,77].

Accordingly, during limited flexion activities, such as climbing stairs, the AP motion of the medial condyle may be similar to the motion of the lateral condyle, although the knee shows an overall medial pivot over its full range of motion [80,81]. For the solution of the kinematic limitations of contemporary implants, a novel design process was introduced to develop anatomy-mimetic articular surfaces directly from in vivo knee joint motion [82][83][84].
