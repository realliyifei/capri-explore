(p1.0) The polymers obtained from living resources or biological origin, including plants, animals, or microorganisms, and their system biology processes are called natural polymers. Carbohydrates, i.e., arabinoxylan, chitosan and starch, proteins, e.g., gelatin and keratin, and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) such as poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)], are all known as biopolymers [8]. Biopolymeric composite materials' synthesis employs one or more biopolymers to enhance structural and functional properties in the resulting composites [9]. A biopolymer's composition influences its functional properties, whereas functional potential depends largely on the crystalline or amorphous materials' behavior. For example, cellulose is a structural polymer where its features are partly due to its crystalline nature.

(p3.0) Polymeric composites come from a wide range of sources, from common synthetic materials (petroleum-based) including polystyrene to natural biopolymers like cellulose, proteins, and microbial polyesters, which are important for biological structure and function [18,19]. A broader spectrum of these polymeric materials has been categorized as natural or synthetic according to their source's nature, as presented in Figure 2. Biopolymers or bio-based polymer composites can be classified into three main categories, depending on their source. tions [14,15]. There are many problems to be considered, such as technical and turing issues before the widespread use of bio-sustainable polymers is possible. A tial obstacle to the broader use of biopolymers in various sectors is their functio acteristics that appear to be unfavorable compared with established petroleum-b ymers. For example, their performance is lower than that of plastic materials structural nature of a part of biopolymers with single bonds leads to lower m characteristics [16,17]. These deficiencies can be resolved in various ways, such ing, mixing, blending, and reinforcing with other appropriate polymers and cer
