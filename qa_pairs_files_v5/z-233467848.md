(p1.0) MR imaging involves the optimal evaluation of masses because of its inherent soft tissue contrast and multiplanar abilities. MR imaging aspects of indeterminate masses tend to provide well distinguished morphologic information on tumors such as its location, size, and composition (2). T2-weighted sequences incorporate an integral part of MR imaging that is performed to characterize masses. A greater percentage of intra-abdominal tumors comprise cystic components that display high SI on T2-weighted images. The findings of T2-low signal tumors are not common, which requires care when they are interpreted. These interpretations should be made based on aspects such as pathologic correlates such as smooth muscle, blood products, calcification, high tumor cellularity, and fibrous tissue (2).
