## (s5) Wax patterning
Number of References: 7

(p5.0) Wax is a hydrophobic substance that can be used on the hydrophobic surface using different ways. There are many benefits of using wax printing for the patterning of devices, including ease of fabrication, nontoxicity, disposability, and lower production costs. In 2009, Lu et al. [10] created a new wax impregnation process known as wax printing. Molten wax, as opposed to ink or toner, is imprinted on the surface of the paper by solid ink printers used for wax printing [11,12].

(p5.1) Heat is applied to a piece of paper with a wax design printed on one side in order to flow the wax and permit it to reach the paper's thickness [13,14]. This creates a hydrophobic barrier that is entirely impermeable and has a hydrophilic zone enclosed inside it that is shaped like a wax printing pattern. To prevent the reverse side of paper from becoming wet and to stop the permeation-related leakage of reagents and samples to the other side, a clear tape [15,16] or laminated film is lastly applied to one side of the paper. While the wax is heated, it spreads both laterally and vertically, therefore this must be taken into consideration when drawing the designs. Channels of various sizes can be produced by printing wax in a variety of thicknesses or quantities.
## (s8) Laser treatment
Number of References: 3

(p8.0) The CO 2 laser is the most often utilized laser source for creating paper-based devices. Without support material to shield the material at the back, this can go into anything in a single pass. In order to create microfluidic devices, double-sided adhesive, PMMA, and paper are frequently sliced using a CO 2 laser while maintaining the specific value of operational parameters like the strength of the laser and the reading rate to prevent paper cutting. Mani et al. [22] reported a microchip to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in the human body, which was framed using a laser cutting procedure. This TB ELISA is a fast, low-cost, and magnetically operated platform. The test duration could be halved to about 15 min while maintaining detection efficiencies on par with those of traditional, classical ELISA. Renault et al. [23] considerably enhanced the rate of flow of liquid on the porous chip and decreased nonspecific adsorption by cutting a channel with a laser to create an intermediate hollowed-out sandwich chip sensor (hollow channel). Chitnis et al. [24] proposed a laser-treated microfluidic device with the use of a substrate made of parchment paper. With the use of computer-controlled CO 2 optical trimming and engraving machinery, the texture of the parchment paper was altered. The parchment sheet was treated after being spread open and placed on a pedestal. The intended pattern was created on the parchment paper using rapid scanning of the laser beam throughout the face. However, its usage is constrained by the need for expensive equipment and cautious processing.
## (s9) Plotting
Number of References: 6

(p9.0) In the earlier days, 2D plotter was used for the fabrication of PADs. It is a charting tool that can print or plot two-dimensional items on a plane. By altering the type of plotter head being used, one can switch between plotting and printing [25]. Fabrication of PADs often involves the employment of a spray nozzle that emits an ink stream. A 2D plotter sprays hydrophobic ink onto the paper that is within the plotter. Computing systems have the ability to predetermine or regulate the spray pattern. Depending on the density of the ink and its ability to penetrates into the paper at different temperatures, heating the paper after plotting may or may not be necessary. Bruzewicz et al. [26] modified the xy plotter to print the solution of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in hexane over the filter paper. The hydrophobic polymer entered the paper's depths and blocked aqueous solutions from entering the filter paper. This process produces inexpensive, paper-based, physically flexible gadgets. An easier approach to creating paper devices was the use of wax pens [10]. Wax was used to trace the necessary patterns across both faces of a piece of filter paper, which was then baked for a brief length of time. Because of the high temperature, the wax may melt and permeate the paper in the precise pattern of channels needed to create a hydrophobic wall. Laser plotting is another plotting technique to create microchannels by using a laser plotter [27]. In essence, the thermal deterioration action that engraves the surface of the chosen material is the basis for the microstructures produced by this technique. Ink plotting is also a commonly used plotting method in which hydrophobic barriers are created on paper using an X -Y plotter and hydrophobic inks are put into pens [26,28]. The hydrophobic ink is absorbed in the sheet of paper due to the proper selection of ink viscosity and plotter head pressure. Although this method is cheap, the resolution of the pattern is only moderate. The method takes a long time, thus it's better suited for creating small quantities of devices.  
## (s13) Plasma treatment
Number of References: 5

(p13.0) Plasma treatment was utilized to construct μPAD by initially making a hydrophobic surface, and then hydrophobic material was then precisely removed by presenting the substrate to plasma over a physical barrier with the necessary pattern. The shield stay helps in the selective itching of the porous substrate and makes the paper sheet a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Alkyl ketene dimer(AKD) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)are two chemicals that are frequently used to make paper hydrophobic. Both (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 8 Schematic illustration of designing of μPADs: a paper, b octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) coated paper, c soft pad and PMMA mask were separated by OTS-coated paper and subjected to corona discharge after assembly, d patterned μPAD a plasma cleaner [34,35] and a portable corona generator [36] have been proposed for plasma treatment.

(p13.1) Li et al. [34] patterned the paper by dipping it in an AKD-heptane solution and then putting it in a fume hood evaporate the heptane. The AKD was then treated on filter paper by heating it in an oven, making the material hydrophobic. A vacuum plasma reactor was used to process the modified paper while it was positioned between two metal masks with the necessary patterns. Following the plasma treatment, the exposed portions turned hydrophilic. As a typical industrial material, AKD is affordable and easily accessible. However, each pattern is unique to metal masks. The metal masks should be costly and difficult as a result. Fluorocarbon plasma polymerization for the creation of PADs was proven [37]. Two masks i.e., a positive mask and a negative mask were tightly positioned on either side of the filter paper. Afterward, the plasma system made the hydrophobic barrier on sandwiched by puncturing the fluorocarbon. Obeso and colleagues have reported using plasma and poly (hydroxybutyrate) for the production of PADs. The plasma procedure resembles the plasma therapy that was previously mentioned. But in this instance, the paper is dried at ambient temperature after being submerged in various solutions in succession. This method involves producing the paper beforehand, which takes time but results in a straightforward plasma procedure.
## (s14) Chemical vapor-phase deposition
Number of References: 2

(p14.0) Kwong and Gupta [38] first introduced the chemical vapor-phase deposition-based patterning technology for functional polymers, and afterward, the methodology was expanded for pure polymers. A magnet and a metal mask were positioned on either side of the filter paper. The monomer was placed in a sublimation chamber that had been emptied in order to undergo pyrolysis and create radical monomers. These were applied to the exposed area of the paper, where they were subsequently polymerized to form hydrophobic barriers. Then, a similar method for creating PADs that involved vapor-phase layering of pure polymers was published [39]. In the latter procedure, a magnet and a metal mask were placed on top of the filter paper. A suitable quantity of monomers was added to an evacuated sublimation chamber, where they were allowed to evaporate before being pyrolyzed into radical monomers.
## (s19) Flow rate control (programming and timing)
Number of References: 7

(p19.0) One of the earliest examples of fluid flow control was made by Martinez et al. [42] in 2010, who created a multi-dimensional μPAD with 'on' buttons that could be used only once to change the flow path. When pressed, fluidic channels were connected between layers of porous material and tape that were strategically spaced apart. Until it was pressed, this computerized valve could fully stop the flow. While single-use valves have their drawbacks, this work showed how programmable PADs might be useful for testing or manually regulating the sequence of reactions. Other researchers [43][44][45] published additional techniques for managing fluidic transport by changing the shape of the channel. When a channel junction changes from narrow to wide, the flow rate decreases. Another way of flow control was introduced by Toley et al. [46] by redirecting the flow through an adjustable cellulosic shunt that was put in the direction of flow and in direct contact with the paper. By wicking fluid via a bridge made of soluble sugars, Houghtaling et al. [47] used a similar idea to digital 'on/off' switches, successfully shutting off the flow. Afterward, a water-soluble pullulan film was created by Jahanshahi et al. [48] that performed a comparable function.
## (s20) Multi-step processing
Number of References: 6

(p20.0) Automating multi-step procedures is the first step in the trend toward making PAD tests more functional. By adding numerous steady portions of paper for each step of the reagent addition process, Fu et al. [49] and Lutz et al. [50] examined the successive transportation of various chemicals to a detecting zone. To build an automated sandwich ELISA experiment, Apilux et al. [51] defined numerous flow routes of variable lengths with various chemicals in each path. Li et al. [52] use of magnetically timed 'open/closed' single-use valves allowed them to show device control for multi-step tests. The facial tissue that made up each valve was essentially a porous substance attached with a cantilever. At the beginning of time, either the valve was lowered onto the stream, allowing fluid to flow through it, or it was lifted just above stream, preventing flow. The cantilever was activated by a resistor when the stream from the inlet approached the resistor. The intended delay for on-chip processes determined the length of the timing channel. Furthermore, Fridley et al. [53] showed that depending on the manner in which reagents are put in devices, compounds dried in the paper are amenable for multi-step processing. In their method, a single detection zone made by a PAD cut from nitrocellulose was downstream of channels that carried dry chemicals and each was a different size from the monitoring zone. All three reagents in the porous substance attached at the same time and were closest to the detection zone overall arrived and reached the detection zone first. In an effort  to cut the price and size of the LFAs development process, Anderson et al. [54] offered a revolutionary platform centered on the adaptability and capacity of an autonomous fluid handling system. The technology was first successfully used to create an LFA for malaria, but it was quickly expanded to allow for the development of LFAs for SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well. This automatic system increased both the number and quality of LFA assay development efforts by cutting down on hands-on time, increasing experiment size, and facilitating enhanced repeatability.
## (s23) Carbon electrodes
Number of References: 2

(p23.0) Due to ease of manufacturing, ease of chemical alteration, and large possible opening in liquids, carbon is a desirable electrode material. For these reasons, carbon was the first material to be used as a functioning electrode in ePADs [59]. Since then, other instances of carbon electrodes and related fabrication techniques have been demonstrated. The dual-based lab-on-paper device created by Apilux et al. [60] demonstrated a quick and easy way to quantify Au(III) using colorimetry as indicated in Fig. 11.
## (s24) Screen-printing
Number of References: 6

(p24.0) It is widely used method for fabricating carbon electrodes [61][62][63][64]. Polymerizing photoreactive polymercoated screens around masks is commonly accomplished through photolithography. Another technique involves printing through a silk screen-adhered solid film with a craft-or laser-cut pattern. For the electrocatalytic detection of thiols, Dossi et al. printed an electrode that was combined with cobalt phthalocyanine [65]. Graphene or nanoparticles have also been used in other examples to increase the performance of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) [66].
## (s25) Stencil-printing
Number of References: 3

(p25.0) Screen printing and stencil printing are relatively similar processes [67]. This technique uses transparency film or sticky tape to make masks instead of the usual screen materials. Using craft or laser cutters, stencils are easily made. In order to maintain pattern fidelity while stencil printing as compared to screen printing, more dense ink is required so the electrode material is dispensed via an open hole as opposed to a mesh. Viscous ink improves electrode conductivity but reduces the endurance of the electrodes and the adhesion of the paper [68,69]. The improvement of ink viscosity and composition can help either screen printing or stencil printing.
## (s26) Pencil drawing
Number of References: 2

(p26.0) For inexpensive aqueous and nonaqueous media detection, graphite pencil leads are also used to make electrodes on paper. Santhiago et al. reported using the graphite pencil concept to create electrodes for a paper-based device [70]. For precise detection, lead and graphite were first polished before being put in touch with the paper device. In early works, H-type pencils were used to create the electrodes in order to get a satisfactory electrochemical reaction. However, more recent studies have discovered that soft lead, which has a greater graphite-to-binder ratio, is the ideal material for creating conductive electrodes on paper. Dossi et al. [71] established the concept of pencil lead production after recognizing the significance of binders composition in electrodes. Different binder compositions and additives, such as decamethylferrocene or CoPC, were used Counter Electrode during the pencil lead's fabrication to enhance performance and serve as a mediator during electrochemical detection, respectively.
## (s33) Connections
Number of References: 3

(p33.0) In order to generate power, μPADs can use paper-based batteries; nevertheless, according to WHO guidelines, a flawless diagnostic device would operate without the use of additional batteries [78,79]. These fluidic batteries are constructed so that the power supply is near the test, making it simpler to connect them. The fluidic battery cannot operate until the sample is placed inside the device. As a result, the sample can be utilized to power any required assay-related components in addition to conducting an assay. Due to integrated galvanic cells, fluidic batteries may provide the appropriate voltage or current. These cells can also be changed to incorporate the smallest amount of electrolytes and electrodes required for a specific procedure [80].
## (s38) Colorimetric detection
Number of References: 12

(p38.0) It is currently one of the frequently utilized methods for detection in PADs because of the benefits of a visible interpretation, quick detection efficiency, practicality for rural field applications, simple operation, and good stability. In colorimetric detection, the analyte solution is passively transported by capillary action to the test zone of the apparatus, where it reacts with properly positioned reagents to generate a perceptible color change. Basically, the digital/CMOS cameras, scanners, or cell phones used in PAD colorimetric detection systems are used to capture the detection zone images, which are then sent to a computer or a mobile device for processing. For colorimetry-based analysis, LFAs are the most popular PADs. Because LFAs are simple to use, biodegradable, quick, and lab-free, they are beneficial for POCT and allow for the quick sensing of biomolecules like proteins in complicated samples without prior pretreatment. The majority of commercial LFAs that rely on optical sensings, such as HIV testing, pregnancy tests, and other bios studies, have been developed using aptamer-or protein-labeled gold nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugate probes. A PAD for the identification of acetylcholinesterase activity and inhibitor screening was created by Liu and Gomez [83] based on colorimetric sensing. The fabrication of the PAD used a direct wax printing procedure in which wax was applied to the paper to form the hydrophobic barrier. Cardoso et al. [84] proposed a variety of colorimetric PADs for the measurement of numerous analytes, like whiskey, BSA, tear glucose, urea, ketone bodies, nitrite, glucose, bilirubin, etc [85,86]. To detect Hg +2 ions, Meelapsom et al. [87] created an Ag nanoparticleprocessed multi-layered PAD employing thick paper and an ink-jet printing technique. The Hg +2 ions used in the detecting procedure oxidized the Ag nanoparticles, causing them to break up into smaller particles, reducing Hg +2 to Hg, and the detection zone's color is changed from deep yellow to vibrant yellow. It was demonstrated that the gadget could detect particles as small as 1 × 10 −3 ppm. A PAD was created by Yamada et al. [88] to deliver the findings of chemical analysis in the manner of "text" by combining the utilization of a conventional colorimetric indicator with an inert colorant. Protein in urine has been utilized as a proof-of-concept model analytical target. Human urine was used in user tests, and the results showed that the created device's accuracy was on a level with a conventional dipstick.

(p38.1) For the colorimetric detection of Hg +2 , Cd +2 , Zn +2 , Ni +2 +, and F e +3 ions in drinking water or effluent using chromogenic chemicals, Mujawar et al. [89] proposed a PAD for recycling waste to create low-cost analytical devices. The F e +3 ions were determined using an extremely reactive 2-hydroxy-1naphthaldehyde (HyNA) reagent in an optical assay plate with conical wells. An excellent limit of detection and limit of quantification of total F e +3 ions were achieved. The proposed approach proved successful in detecting and precisely determining F e +3 ions in tap and marine water samples. Chowdury et al. [90] proposed a μPAD added with a nanosensor made of gold and functionalized with α-lipoic acid and thioguanine for detection of arsenic in hand tubewells water. By raising the pH of the PADs to 12.1, a technique was created to prevent the influence of the alkaline metals (Ca, Mg, K, and Na) prevalent in Bangladesh groundwater.

(p38.2) This test, which evaluates if the concentration of arsenic in the water is beyond or under the WHO recommended limit of 10 g/L, was the inaugural paper-based test to be approved using water samples from Bangladesh. Liu et al. [91] demonstrated an effective framework consisting of a paper-based/PMMA chip with a colorimetric sensor to measure SO 2 concentrations. The sample in the suggested apparatus was kept on a small piece of paper that had been treated with an acid-base marker before being placed inside a PMMA microchip. It was shown that the SO 2 percentage results taken for 15 industrial food samples using the suggested methodology deviated from the values obtained using a recognized macroscale approach by a maximum of 4.29 percent [92]. Mahmoudi et al. [93] designed a colorimetric PAD for rapid and hands-free telomerase activity sensing by utilizing color shift in accordance with enzyme activity. The telomerase was extended along with a biotinylated probe and an oligonucleotide that was complementary to the telomeres. The hydroxylamine hydrochloride approach for enlarging the AuNPs allows for a signal enhancement that results in color that is apparent to the naked eye once the assembly has been joined. With a measurement range of 6 to 25,000 cells, visual telomerase activity identification was achieved down to 6 cells when the analytical performance of the enzyme extracted from breast cancer cells was assessed. The hue of the porous sheet evolved from light-red to light-red-blue to black-red with increasing telomerase content. Fu et al. [94] suggested a colorimetric assay for telomerase activity detection on functionalized cellulose paper using methylene blue (MB) as a colorimetric probe and was focused on telomeric elongation and collecting amplification. The telomerase substrate was placed onto sterile cellulose paper (TS). Telomerase will lengthen this primer, resulting in a long single DNA that will further catch more probes and raise the assay's responsiveness. When MB-labeled oligonucleotides hybridize with sDNA, the color will change. Signal strength is correlated with sDNA content and hence with telomerase activity. Oligonucleotides are unable to hybridize with sDNA when telomerase is not present in the samples. Telomerase will stretch this primer to generate a single DNA (sDNA), which will further attract more probes and improve the sensitivity of the assay. The color will change when MB-labeled oligonucleotides hybridize with sDNA. The quantity of sDNA and thus the activity of telomerase is associated with signal strength. In samples lacking telomerase, oligonucleotides are not able to hybridise with sDNA.
## (s39) Electrochemical detection
Number of References: 2

(p39.0) Dungchai et al. [59] merged the concept of electrochemical detection with μPADs. The channels in chromatography paper were created using photolithography and carbon electrodes were printed using screen-printing techniques. By sensing uric acid, lactate, and glucose in biological samples, Dungchai and coworkers further demonstrated the device's biosensory capacity. The three different electrodes in this trial are changed with lactate oxidase, glucose oxidase, and urease, respectively, by adding enzyme solution into the corresponding test region. Diabetes is a very common disease and the glucose levels of the patient must be continuously monitored in an easy way. In order to measure glucose levels, Fernando et al. [95] created an electrochemical microfluidic paper-based analysis device (PAD) that utilises sweat and saliva as a sample. The creation of a three-electrode system uses pseudo-reference stainless steel and a working electrode that has been anodized using sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate. With a limit of detection of 0.058 mmol dm-3 and a working range of 1 to 10 mmol dm-3, cyclic voltammetricbased assessment of glucose using PAD achieved a linear response.
## (s41) Chemiluminescence detection
Number of References: 5

(p41.0) Another sensitive and effective detection method for PADs is chemiluminescence sensing. The method shines in terms of its ease of use, fast response, and interoperability with micro technologies, enabling numerous applications, even for those who are not trained [111]. However, the sensing must be done in the dark, which makes it more difficult to make the device. Portable chemiluminescence readers are also required for this procedure. The chemiluminescence (CL) technique and μPADs were integrated for the first time by Yu et al. [112] to create a unique CL PAD biosensor. The oxidase enzyme reactions and the chemiluminescence reaction between a rhodanine derivative and produced H 2 O 2 in an acid medium are the foundations of this lab-onpaper biosensor. This CL PAD biosensor was skillful in quantitatively determining uric acid with accurate and satisfying results. Then, the same researcher [113] created a PCAD to sense both glucose and uric acid in fake urine simultaneously. They discovered that by varying the ranges that the samples traveled, it was feasible to simultaneously measure uric acid and glucose. Al et al. [114] invented a portable PAD for onsite screening of dangerous mercury ions (Hg +2 ) in cosmetics with a limit of detection of 0.04 g ml. It is founded on the fundamental ability of quantum dots of carbon (CQDs) to function as an excellent emitter for the bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)oxalate (TCPO)hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) CL reaction. Zangheri et al. [115] created a biosensor that uses a CL-lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) technique to detect salivary cortisol quantitatively using a smartphone app. The biosensor works by using a peroxidase-cortisol conjugate in a direct competitive immunoassay and detecting the result by incorporating the chemiluminescent substrates enhancer/H 2 O 2 /luminol. It provides quantitative analysis between 0.3 and 60 ng/ml for the therapeutically appropriate range of salivary cortisol detection.
## (s45) L-W model considering gravity force
Number of References: 2

(p45.0) In some circumstances, it can be challenging to utilize the standard L-W equation to determine the performance of device as different diagnostic tools and experimental paper strips operated vertically. The force of gravity commences existing as a result of fluid flowing vertically. The gravitational force eventually becomes a significant role in the liquid immigration process as the liquid rises, which causes a substantial difference between the theoretical and experimental liquid front. A general correlation between the liquid front and time is created to address this issue [122,123]. From Eq. (1) we obtain
## (s50) Plasma separation
Number of References: 6

(p50.0) Since most medical diagnoses require a blood test as a prerequisite or necessary step, blood is the most important clinical analyte. The accurate interpretation of blood can deliver extensive information about a candidate's physiological state, enabling effective pathological diagnosis. The examination of blood, which is a complicated mixture of red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, and other necessary components, is challenging. Because it transports all the vitamins, proteins, and minerals throughout the body, it controls all hemostatic and physiological parameters and could be used as a diagnostic analyte. First, the serum must be isolated from whole blood to be clinically diagnosed. For diagnosing either erythrocyte-related information or a routine concern of the other blood constituents excluding the erythrocytes, the separation of plasma from that of the whole blood is always the first step. Due to the presence of erythrocytes during the diagnosis, it is frequently difficult to detect a complex analyte like blood utilizing colorimetric, fluorescence, and chemiluminescence methods. These red blood cells may agglutinate and interfere with biochemical processes, as well as convert chemical signals to optical signals when used with color-based or optical-based sensing technologies. Erythrocytes influence the rheological dynamics of the blood in electrochemical detection situations. Therefore, separating the plasma from the erythrocytes is a step that must be taken while diagnosing blood. The use of RBC-specific adherent membranes, which permit plasma to pass through the paper, is the most used method for separating RBCs [138]. To separate RBCs from whole blood, electrochemical techniques [139] and agglutination reagent [140] have attracted interest as they could directly operate the whole blood sample as shown in Fig. 13. A cheap paper-based platform was created by Kar et al. [141] to extract blood plasma from a whole blood sample. They created a paper gadget based on the elegant separation method and the straightforward origami method, where the complete device is built by folding a single sheet of flat paper. This technique can be used to quickly identify sick states in blood samples without the use of experienced workers or specialized lab settings. Another device for separating plasma from whole blood and determining glucose concentration was described [142]. This device does not require a membrane to separate the plasma from the whole blood sample and will be helpful in creating POC testing equipment that can identify analytes in small sample quantities. A BPS PAD was created by Burgos et al. [143] to identify and measure the S100B biomarker in peripheral whole blood. The VF2 collecting pad, which conducts vertical and lateral plasma separation was added with the complete blood sample. As a result of the cells creating and becoming trapped in the VF2 matrix due to hypertonic circumstances, the addition of NaCl to the VF2 pad causes RBCs to aggregate and increased plasma wicking.
## (s52) Detection of hormones in non-invasive body fluids
Number of References: 6

(p52.0) Non-invasive fluids are defined as substances that exist out of the human body. These include human breast milk, saliva, perspiration, and urine. These fluids have also been used for monitoring blood sugar, diagnosing celiac disease, evaluating alteration in body fluids, measuring pH and sodium levels in saliva and sweat, determining body fluid dynamics, and more ( [150][151][152], etc.). A DNA aptamer-based sensor was developed [153] to identify dopamine in urine. Duplex aptamer dissociation served as the method's foundation, in which dopamine in the urine caused the sensor to alter conformation and become released from the capture probe. Schonhorn et al. [154] created a sandwich immunoassay for the pregnancy biomarker (human chorionic gonadotropin) hCG detection in urine. The experiment involved a three-dimensional patterned piece of paper with unaltered and hydrophobic wax-printed sections. The detection limit for this colorimetric approach was 6.7 mIU/ml, and the detection range was 0-250 mIU/ml. Within 10 min, the test's findings were ready. A unique molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) grafted PAD for the sensing of 17-E2, which are essential for female menstrual and estrous cycles, was created by Xiao et al. [155] by using 12 mL of acetonitrile as the solvent, and using the molar ratios of 12:12:1 for the crosslinker, functional monomer, and template molecule. The detection limit for 17-estradiol in samples of human milk and urine using this method was determined to be 0.25 g/l.
## (s55) Environmental monitoring
Number of References: 6

(p55.0) Environmental deterioration has recently become the top worry for environmentalists. Ample resources, such as power and water, are needed for both home and industrial activities due to the continuously growing population and progress of the human race. The side products and leftovers of industrialization are released into the ambiance at the same time in the form of hazardous gases and effluents. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to control and regulate the toxins, particularly in the ambiance fluid. Nie et a. [67] presented the first instance of a paper-based sensor designed for the sensing of heavy metal in 2010. To move the sample through the device, they used screen-printed electrodes made from paper, on which microchannels were created using patterning methods. Mensah et al. [174] developed solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs) based on a porous site to quantify Cd +2 , Ag + , and K + . To accomplish the specificity for the ions, PAD was equipped with a membrane that contains ionic sites, and traditional ionophores for Cd +2 , Ag + , and K + . Yu et al. [175] created a device based on the lamination approach to detect lead. A spatula was used to apply conductive electrodes to the paper after it had been cut out using a CO 2 laser to seep the ink into the paper. The electrode layer of PAD was then positioned between two more paper layers that had been sandwiched together and layered with the biodegradable polyester polycaprolactone (PCL). The resulting laminated electrodes were then permanently put together to provide a durable and practical device. Wang et al. [176] created a paper-based multianalyte detection system in 2018 using nitrocellulose paper (0.45 m pore size). The three-electrode cell used in the paper-based electrodes was created using the magnetron sputtering technique, which spat a thin layer of gold onto the paper. PAD's capabilities were initially tested for the purpose of detecting Cu +2 , which was then used to refine the voltammetric parameters. Studying the interference from P b +2 , Cd +2 , Zn +2 , Bi +3 , Cl, Na + , and K + revealed that the Cu +2 signal decreased by up to 10 percent, reaching a value of 15 percent in the presence of P b +2 , while still demonstrating the device's good performance. A separate methodology was proposed by Shimizu et al. [177] for quantification of phosphate over paper. The Murphy and Riley approach was used by the authors, and they took advantage of the P-Mo complex's creation in a solution before introducing the analyte and the reagents to the paper electrode. It has been demonstrated that using this method enables simultaneous increases in the active regions and unhindered redox processes. For the monitoring of paraoxon-ethyl in soil and fertilized soil samples, Cioffi et al. [178] created an electrochemical biosensor based on office paper. The sample required 100 L of aqueous solution (2 percent ethanol) for the treatment, accompanied by a vortex and filtration with an MF-Millipore Membrane Filter. The bio detector was able to detect quantities of 10 and 25 ng/mL in soil with recovery values of 84 percent and 97 percent, respectively, based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 in standard solutions.
## (s58) Fuel cells
Number of References: 4

(p58.0) It is a device that generates electricity through a chemical process. In contrast to batteries, cells do not deplete or require a recharge. The identification and application of sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supplies are required due to the rapid increase in energy consumption. Applications for wind energy, photovoltaics, and other renewable energy sources are constrained by their low efficiency. As a more efficient means of converting a fuel's chemical energy into electric power, fuel cells have emerged as a superior alternative for generating energy. These microfluidic fuel cells include chemical sensors in addition to being employed with communication and transportation systems. Zebda et al. [187] proposed an enzyme-based micro fuel cell in which electrodes were positioned along the catholyte and anolyte streams of the fuel and oxidant streams in the Y-direction. While glucose oxidase worked at the anode to oxidize glucose, laccase worked at the cathode to reduce O 2 . Noh and Shim [188] reported another enzymatic fuel cell by immobilizing enzyme (glucose oxidases) molecules to the electrode surface in order to further lower the cost and extend the life of the fuel cell up to 16 days. The power density and open circuit voltage produced by the conversion of glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide are 0.78 mW cm 2 and 0.48 V, respectively. Using graphite electrodes attached to conductive wires through silver adhesive paste on a Y-shaped filter paper strip, Arun et al. [189] created a capillarity-mediated fuel cell. Inlet channels were soaked in a solution of sulfuric acid (oxidant) and formic acid (fuel). Formic acid produced 32 mW cm 2 of electricity for more than 15 h by utilizing 1 mL of fuel. On the anode, formic acid broke down into CO 2 and electrons, which were then transmitted to the cathode by the external circuit. Based on the idea of reversed electrodialysis, Chang et al. created a multi-layered paper device for energy harvesting. This approach uses asymmetric ion transport through ionselective membranes to extract energy from two solutions with varying salt contents. A voltage differential across the membrane is caused by the concentration difference, which generates electricity. Wax was used to define the flow, and the paper was coated with Ag/AgCl ink to create the electrodes. When a potassium chloride concentration gradient (0.1 mM/100 mM) was applied across the membrane of the device, which uses an ionselective membrane placed between two layers of waxprinted paper, the device produced a power density of 275 nW cm 2 . In order to control the capillary flow on paper, Wang et al. [137] proposed coupling the microfluidic channel outputs with a photothermal module for water evaporation. As a proof of concept, prototype paper-based microfluidic fuel cells coupled to a photothermal module are created. Their peak power density can rise when exposed to simulated sunlight. The recent research opens a new avenue for controlling the functionality of PAD, a problem that has long existed in this field. It not only provides a realistic way to improve the efficiency of solar-powered paper-based microfluidic fuel cells.
