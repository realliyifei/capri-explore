## (s3) Initial Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Evaluations of Children with Elevated Blood Lead Concentrations
Number of References: 2

(p3.0) Two small studies were among the first pediatric environmental epidemiology studies investigating the effects of childhood lead exposure. Trope et al. examined the frontal cortex of lead-exposed children using high-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for evidence of metabolic differences. The initial case-control report pointed to a reduction of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) ratio within the middle frontal cortex of a 10-year-old boy with elevated blood lead concentrations (e.g., 51 µg/dL at 38 months) Diagnostics 2022, 12, 641 4 of 21 compared to his healthy 9-year-old cousin living in the same household [4]. A subsequent small cohort study with 16 children having at least one blood lead concentration exceeding 23 µg/dL before the age of 5 years replicated the case-control study finding [5].
## (s6) Neuroimaging of the Dunedin New Zealand Study Evaluating the Effects of Childhood Lead Exposure
Number of References: 2

(p6.0) Starting in 1972, the Dunedin Study setup a population representative birth cohort in New Zealand. Anatomical and diffusion MRI was acquired for participants at age 45 years who previously had blood lead concentrations assessed at 11 years of age (n = 564 members representing 57% of the original cohort, 54% male) [14]. The mean blood lead concentration at 11 years was 10.99 (SD 4.63) µg/dL. After adjusting for covariates, each 5-µg/dL higher childhood blood lead concentration was significantly associated with 1.19-cm (cm) 2 smaller cortical surface area, 0.10-cm 3 smaller hippocampal volume, lower global fractional anisotropy, and a BrainAGE index 0.77 years older than expected at age 45 years. However, the study authors found no statistically significant associations between blood lead concentration and log-transformed white matter hyperintensity volume or mean cortical thickness [14].
## (s9) Manganese Characteristics and MRI
Number of References: 3

(p9.0) Due to its paramagnetic properties, the presence of Mn in the human brain can be quantified with T1-weighted anatomical MRI [24]. Mn shortens the water proton T1 relaxation rate in brain tissue, producing hyperintense signal within sub-structures where Mn is stored.  [27]. Quantitative T1 and T2 mapping sequences were obtained from 10 children with long-term exposure to higher water Mn (median 145 µg/L) and 13 children as age-matched controls with lower water Mn concentrations (median 0.9 µg/L). Three metrics were compared between groups: (1) The signal intensity within the globus pallidus relative to subcortical frontal white matter (known as the standard pallidal index (PI)); (2) the signal intensity within the globus pallidus relative to pericranial muscles; and (3) calculated T1 relaxation time. Children exposed to higher water Mn concentrations had lower PI referenced to pericranial muscles and higher T1 relaxation time compared to those in the lower Mn water concentration group. The standard PI failed to show any differences between the higher and lower water Mn groups [27].
## (s10) Italian Adolescents, Manganese, and Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Number of References: 2

(p10.0) De Water et al. investigated the associations between prenatal, early postnatal, and childhood dentine Mn concentrations and intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) for adolescents enrolled in a longitudinal cohort from northern Italy [29]. The study team estimated prenatal, early postnatal, and childhood Mn concentrations in deciduous teeth using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Dentine Mn concentrations (Mn:Calcium ratio) were highest during the prenatal period and significantly diminished throughout childhood. Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from 14 adolescents (12-18 years; 6 girls) was post-processed with seed-based correlation analyses featuring six subcortical seeds (pallidum, putamen, left, and right caudate) and one cortical seed (bilateral middle frontal gyrus) from Harvard-Oxford atlases. With linear and quadratic correlations between log-transformed Mn concentrations and seed-based iFC (Bonferronicorrected), controlling for either socio-economic status, sex or age, the study reported postnatal Mn concentrations were associated with increased iFC between the middle frontal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex, however, decreased iFC between the right putamen and pre-and postcentral gyrus. Summarizing the preliminary work, the study found early postnatal Mn concentrations are associated with increased iFC within cognitive control brain areas, but decreased iFC between motor areas in adolescents [29].
## (s12) Pre-and Postnatal Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Morphological MRI in Urban Children
Number of References: 2

(p12.0) Peterson and colleagues evaluated 40 urban children from New York City with anatomical MRI between ages 7 and 9 years [30]. Pre-and postnatal PAH exposures were compared with morphological measures that indexed local volumes on the surface of the brain and the white matter surface upon removal of cortical gray matter. The study did not find an association between individual PAH exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy and any measure of cortical thickness. However, they reported an association between higher PAH exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy and a lower white matter surface, almost exclusively to the left hemisphere of the brain. The study authors observed prenatal exposure to PAH air pollutants contributed to slower processing speed, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, and externalizing problems in urban children and disrupted the development of left hemisphere white matter, whereas postnatal PAH exposure contributed to additional disturbances in the development of white matter in dorsal prefrontal regions [30].
## (s14) Morphological MRI of Children and Adolescents from The Netherlands Exposed to Air Pollution
Number of References: 4

(p14.0) Guxens et al. evaluated if air pollution exposures during fetal life altered brain morphology and if the alterations mediate the exposures relationships with cognitive function in school-age children [32]. Air pollution modeled by the team using land-use regression models included nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), coarse particles (difference between particles with aerodynamic diameters < 10 µm and <2.5 µm), fine particles (particles with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 µm), and absorbance of fine particles (proxy for elemental carbon). Children (n = 783, ages 6-10 years) from a population-based birth cohort in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, born between 2002 and 2006, and exposed to higher PM concentrations during fetal life demonstrated thinner cortex in several brain regions of both hemispheres, with more associations found in the right hemisphere. The team determined the cerebral cortex of the precuneus region in the right hemisphere was 0.045 mm (mm) thinner for each 5-µg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 . The reduced cerebral cortex in the precuneus and rostral middle frontal regions partially mediated the association between exposure to PM and impaired inhibitory control. However, exposures were not associated with global brain volumes [32]. Their models were adjusted for parental educational levels, monthly household income, parental countries of birth, parental ages, maternal prenatal smoking, maternal prenatal alcohol use, parental body mass indices and heights, maternal parity, family status, maternal psychological distress, maternal FSIQ, and child gender, age, and genetic ancestry. Lubczynska et al. also using participants from the Rotterdam cohort, however, imaged as pre-adolescents (n = 3133, 9-12 years old) with additional types and greater exposure details of air pollutants modeled during pregnancy and childhood, also found no associations with exposures and global brain volumes [33]. However, the study found when using single pollutant analyses, multiple associations between higher pregnancy and childhood pollutant concentrations with smaller corpus callosum, smaller hippocampus, larger amygdala (pregnancy only), and larger cerebellum (pregnancy only). Higher gestational exposure to air pollutants was associated with smaller cortical thickness in the right postcentral gyrus, right rostral middle frontal gyrus, and the left lingual gyrus, while higher childhood exposure was associated with predominantly larger cortical surface area within the right pre-and post-central gyri, the left precuneus and calcarine cortex [33]. Models were adjusted for parental educational levels, household income, parental countries of birth, parental ages, maternal prenatal smoking, maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, maternal parity, marital status, and parental psychiatric symptoms, parental heights and body mass indices, maternal intelligence quotient, child's genetic ancestry, child's gender and child's age at the scanning session. Subcortical grey matter, corpus callosum, cerebellum, and subcortical brain volumes were additionally adjusted for intracranial volume.
## (s15) Morphological MRI and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Cincinnati Children Exposed to Traffic Related Air Pollution
Number of References: 2

(p15.0) Beckwith et al. examined whether childhood TRAP exposure is associated with regional differences in brain volume and cortical thickness among children enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study based in Cincinnati, Ohio USA [34]. Anatomical T1-weighted MRI from a nested subset of 12-year-old participants (n = 135) characterized with either higher or lower levels of TRAP exposure during their first year of life was analyzed with voxel-based morphometry to examine group differences in regional brain volume, and with separate analyses, changes in cortical thickness. Smaller regional gray matter volumes were found in the left pre-and post-central gyri, the cerebellum, and inferior parietal lobe of participants in the higher TRAP exposure group relative to participants with lower exposure. Reduced cortical thickness was observed in participants with higher exposure relative to those with lower exposure, primarily in sensorimotor regions of the brain including the pre-and post-central gyri and the paracentral lobule, but also within the frontal and limbic regions [34]. These findings are shown in Figure 6. Age at MRI examination, birth weight, participant FSIQ, census tract deprivation status at birth, and race were selected for inclusion in the final model. Total intracranial volume was also included as a covariate for volumetric analyses. Figure 6. Imaging findings acquired from a 3 Tesla scanner at age 12 years from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) comparing high and low groups based upon estimated element carbon attributable to traffic (ECAT) exposure in the first year of life. Left, regions illustrated in red and yellow on brain renderings oriented with different views demonstrate regional reduced cortical thickness. Right, regional gray matter volume loss illustrated across the brain in a sagittal view (top) and axial view showing cerebellar region (bottom) associated with the high ECAT group compared to the low ECAT group. Clusters were corrected for multiple comparisons using threshold free cluster enhancement with a familywise error rate of p < 0.05. Color bar representslog (p) value from 1.4 to 2.6.
## (s17) The ABCD Study, Morphological MRI and PM 2.5 Exposure
Number of References: 2

(p17.0) Cserbik and colleagues examined the cross-sectional associations between concurrent PM 2.5 exposures, hemisphere-and regional-specific differences in brain morphometry and measures of cognition in 10,343 children (ages 9-10 years) who participated in the ABCD Study across the United States [36]. All models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, neighborhood quality, parental higher education, total family income, parental employment status, imaging device manufacturer, handedness and intracranial volume for volumetric measures, including random intercepts for ABCD site and familial relationship. Models were scaled for PM 2.5 using a fixed increment of 5 µg/m 3 . Annual residential PM 2.5 exposure was associated with hemispheric-specific differences in gray matter across cortical regions of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes as well as subcortical and cere-bellum brain regions. There were hemispheric-specific associations between PM 2.5 exposures and cortical surface area in 9/31 regions, cortical thickness in 22/27 regions; and volumes of the thalamus, pallidum, and nucleus accumbens. The analyses revealed regional specific associations between PM 2.5 exposure and cortical thickness of the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and basal ganglia as well as differences in the directionality of associations by hemisphere, some smaller, others larger. An increase of 5-µg/m 3 was associated with differences in cortical thickness on the magnitude ranging from 0.01 to 0.04 mm, suggesting that continual exposure to PM 2.5 during childhood and adolescence could substantially impact an individual's brain growth trajectories with potentially lifelong consequences. However, the team found neither significant associations between PM 2.5 and task performance on individual measures of cognition nor evidence that sex moderated the observed associations [36].

## (s20) Prenatal Chlorpyrifos Exposure and Morphometric MRI in New York Children
Number of References: 2

(p20.0) Rauh and colleagues investigated associations between prenatal chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure and brain morphology using T1-weighted anatomical MRI in 40 children (ages 5-11 years) recruited from an urban, New York City, community-based cohort [37]. Classifying exposure groups by umbilical cord blood CPF concentrations, twenty high-exposure children were compared with 20 low-exposure children for morphological features. After adjusting for age and height, brain sizes were not significantly different between the groups. However, high-exposure children showed frontal and parietal cortical thinning and revealed an inverse dose-response relationship between CPF and cortical thickness. Children in the higher exposure group demonstrated regional enlargements of the cerebral surface area in the superior temporal, posterior middle temporal, and inferior postcentral gyri bilaterally, and in the superior frontal gyrus, gyrus rectus, cuneus, and precuneus along the mesial wall of the right hemisphere [37]. These regions support cognitive and behavioral processes including attention, receptive language, social cognition, reward, emotional, and inhibitory control.
## (s21) Prenatal Organophosphate Exposure and Morphometric MRI in Generation R Study Subset
Number of References: 2

(p21.0) Mother-child pairs (n = 518) participating in the Generation R Study, a populationbased birth cohort from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were studied to determine whether maternal organophosphate (OP) pesticides were associated with child brain morphology [38]. Maternal urine concentrations of OP pesticides collected throughout pregnancy were analyzed for 6 dialkylphosphates (DAPs) including 3 dimethyl (DM) and 3 diethyl (DE) alkyl phosphate metabolites. Anatomical T1-weighted MRI and DTI were acquired when children were between the ages of 9 and 12 years. Brain volumes, surface-based cortical thickness and cortical surface area, and diffusion metrics, FA and MD, were compared with prenatal OP exposures. DM and DE metabolite concentrations were not associated with brain volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area. However, a ten-fold increase in averaged DM metabolite concentrations across pregnancy was associated with lower FA and higher MD. Similar associations were observed for DE concentrations [38]. The models were adjusted for age of child at time of imaging and sex, and maternal age, ethnicity (Dutch, other-western, and non-western), education, income, marital status, alcohol consumption during pregnancy, body mass index, parity, and smoking during pregnancy.
## (s22) Prenatal Organophosphate Exposure and Motor Inhibition Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Number of References: 2

(p22.0) Binter et al. evaluated the association of prenatal OP exposure on inhibitory control employing an fMRI motor inhibition (Go/No-Go task) paradigm [39]. Ninety-five children (ages 10-12 years) from a longitudinal birth cohort completed the fMRI and had maternal OP concentrations available for comparisons. OP exposure was assessed by measuring six DAP metabolites in the urine of women in early pregnancy (<19 weeks gestation). Concentrations were categorized into levels of exposure: low (reference), moderate, or high. Task performance was characterized by average response latency, commission rate, and composite performance score. The models were adjusted for maternal fruit/vegetable consumption and the duration of breastfeeding. Moderate levels of DAP were associated with a decreased commission rate indicating improved performance. Increasing levels of DM and DE were associated with decreased brain activity in the left inferior and bilateral superior frontal regions during successful inhibition. The investigators did not observe any differential activation related to inhibitory demands [39].
## (s24) ETS, Multimodal MRI, Cognitive Control Circuitry in Urban Children
Number of References: 2

(p24.0) To evaluate the effects of ETS exposure, Margolis et al. recruited from a prospective longitudinal urban birth cohort, selecting non-smoking mothers and their children ages 7-9 years [40]. Prenatal maternal and postnatal child urine samples were analyzed for cotinine concentrations. Those with concentrations between 0.05 and 0.99 ng/mL were regarded as non-exposed to ETS in comparison to those with concentrations between 1 and 16 ng/mL considered ETS-exposed. The children completed anatomical T1 weighted MRI (n = 41, 24 ETS-exposed) and fMRI using the Simon Spatial Incompatibility Task (n = 30, 10-exposed). Compared to non-exposed children, prenatally ETS-exposed children had smaller left and right thalamic and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) volumes, and increased activation in the IFG during the resolution of cognitive conflict measured with task fMRI. Reduced thalamic volume was associated with increased IFG activation and attention problems. Post-hoc analyses of postnatal exposure were not associated with brain measures when prenatal exposure was included in the model. Margolis et al. suggested that maternal ETS exposure during pregnancy posited deleterious effects on the structure and function of cognitive control circuitry which impacted attentional capacity in school-age children [40].
## (s25) ETS, Go-No-Go fMRI
Number of References: 2

(p25.0) Using an event-related fMRI design, Bennett et al. compared the brain function of ETS-exposed (n = 7) and unexposed (n = 11) 12-year-olds during a Go/No-Go response inhibition task [41]. Exposure grouping was derived from maternal and child self-report. ETS-exposed children showed greater activation within many regions, especially the left frontal, right occipital, and bilateral temporal and parietal lobes compared with activation patterns in unexposed children. However, children not exposed to ETS showed greater activation in the cerebellum and the occipital lobe. ETS exposure was associated with a different pattern of brain activation among children in early adolescence while controlling for potential confounding factors [41].
