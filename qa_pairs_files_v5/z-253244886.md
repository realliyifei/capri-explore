(p4.0) According to international guidelines, surgical therapy for MD is recommended only for refractory disease, and therefore represents the third (or even the fifth) line of management. Currently, the most popular surgical procedures to control vertigo attacks in MD are also the most aggressive and those that have the most negative impact on auditory function. Besides, there is a lack of evidence suggesting that surgical therapy for MD may provide a significant control of symptoms 35 . The table below shows the main surgical procedures for MD taking into account of hearing preservation, vestibular injury, surgical difficulty and long-term outcomes ( Table  1).

(p4.1) Endolymphatic sac surgery (ESS) can be considered in patients that are refractory to medical management as a nondestructive option, as the risk to damage hearing is low 36 . Xu et al 37 suggested that ESS with posterior tympanotomy and local steroid treatment could improve hearing and ensure a satisfactory vertigo control in patients with intractable MD. In Gibson et al opinion 38 , ESS can provide a vertigo control at least as well as IT gentamicin with a lower incidence of audio-vestibular complications 39 . Transmastoid labyrinthectomy alone 40  More recently, some authors suggested that tenotomy of the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles (TSTM) may be a safe surgical procedure with significant vertigo control, decreased postoperative symptoms and important hearing preservation 46 .

(p5.0) In the diagnosis and the evaluation of therapy efficacy, the audio-vestibular test battery has a primary role, and the diagnostic findings are constantly evolving.  49 . Patients with suspected MD can be examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate a possible inner ear disease. The MRI findings in patients with MD are conflicting, due to the MRI sequences used and the inclusion criteria of the patients; also, the early stage of MD and the early symptoms appear too subtle for identification using MRI, making the reproducibility of hydrops MRI scan protocols debatable 50 .
