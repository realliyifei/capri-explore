(p3.0) Cultivars originating from regions near the equator and/or higher altitudes, as the case of Andean fruit crops, may have developed a greater tolerance to UV-B radiation (Caldwell et al., 1980). A good example of the adaptation of fruit trees to higher altitudes is the study by Voronkov et al. (2019), who found that the levels of phenolic substances and polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in the skin of apples with altitudes increasing from 300 to 1,200 m a.s.l. in the Caucasus. This increase in phenols protects fruits against high UV radiation because of their powerful antioxidant effects, while unsaturated fatty acids retain the fluidity of the fruit's cell membranes within the physiological range (Voronkov et al., 2019).
