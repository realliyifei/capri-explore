Number of References: 8

(p20.0) Eight out of the 10 studies contained a process evaluation of the intervention.Table 9 summarises the process evaluation across the included studies.The process evaluation identifies the nature of delivery and adherence to the intervention to understand the effectiveness of the intervention for the target population.Four studies analysed the participants' fidelity to the intervention.Four studies analysed the acceptability and satisfaction of the intervention.Bradley et al. (2020) adopted a mixture of questionnaires and qualitative interviews to determine the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.Three studies identified training provided to interventionists (care managers and primary care physicians).No study provided an evaluation of cost-effectiveness.Seven studies provided information about the sources of funding from charities (n = 1) and research/state grants (n = 6).Nabors et al. ( 2004) evaluated acceptability and accessibility process variables using questionnaires given to children and teachers respectively [44].Gewirtz et al. (2015) identified fidelity to intervention using attrition analysis of the participant follow-ups and identified no significant differences between the intervention group and control [41].Fidelity to community, counselling or medical services was identified using a structured review in Lee et al. (2010) [42].Brown et al. (2020) reported high satisfaction rates with the implementation and planning of an intervention, but lower ratings were given for participant involvement in the intervention planning [40].Bradley et al. (2020) provided the perspectives of mothers living in hostels on the appropriateness of the adapted intervention content and feasibility within the environment [39].
