(p12.0) If rapid onset of action is desired, 6-24 µg kg -1 min -1 is administered in 10-20 minutes according to the clinical picture of the patient. In patients with systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, a loading dose should be avoided. An optimum maintenance dose of 0.05-0.2 µg kg -1 min -1 is recommended. In doses above 0.2 µg kg -1 min -1 , adverse events may be seen more frequently (Moiseyev et al 2002). Since the half-life of its metabolites is longer, it was shown that the accumulation of metabolites during prolonged infusions enhances the adverse events. Therefore, infusions longer than 24 hours are not recommended (Kivikko et al 2003).
