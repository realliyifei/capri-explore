(p0.0) The variant Omicron exhibits an unusually high volume of mutations in the Spike region and key specific mutations of Omicron includes, N440K, G446S, G339D, E484A, A76V, Q493R, Q498R, G496S, T547K, Y505H, N679K, H655Y, N764K, N856K, D796Y, Q954H, S375F, L981F, N969K, S371L, L212I, and S373P which was revealed through the analysis of its genomic sequence. 14 This change is said to enhance Omicron's severity, infectivity, immune escape, higher binding affinity, and higher transmissibility, thus making Omicron a deadly variant. 15 The viral structure of the SARS-CoV-2 promotes four protein genes that include, M-protein that binds to the host body's protein and structures the shape of the virus, N-protein/Nucleocapsid protein modulates signaling, cell replication cycle and immune response of host towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, E-protein/ Envelope protein which portraits itself as an area for the production and maturation of the virus and the S protein/S-Glycoprotein which divides itself into the region of the head (S1) and stem (S2) with a ratio of 3:2 where, the S1 region houses the N-terminal domain (NTD), two C-terminal domain (CTD), and receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is crucial for new variants in conjunction with host receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The efficiency and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the interaction of ACE2 receptor. 16,17 ACE2 acts as a mediator that facilitates the interaction between itself and SARS-CoV-2 and the other receptor being TMPRSS2 which acts as a coreceptor thereby regulating the infectivity level in living organisms. According to recent studies, genetic changes and vulnerability were found to play a crucial role in viral infections. 18 With the SARS-CoV-2 being an RNA virus, it is of no surprise regarding its capability to mutate and to evolve with greater virulence and to reform itself with hindrance towards the immune system.
