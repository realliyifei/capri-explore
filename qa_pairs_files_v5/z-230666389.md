## (s3) Breastfeeding

(p3.0) The establishment of the microbiome in childhood is important for its microbialimmune crosstalk that is thought to be involved in the pathobiology of disease later in life [37]. A longitudinal study demonstrated that after an early developmental and transitional phase in gut microbial composition, a period of microbial stability is reached by as early as 31 months [38]. The most significant factor associated with the early microbial structure is whether or not an individual was breastfed, and it also appears that this is a significant risk factor for the development of IBD. A recent meta-analysis found that breastfeeding (BF) was protective against the development of both forms of IBD, reducing the risk of developing CD (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.85) and UC (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91) [39]. This protective effect was accentuated if the duration of breastfeeding was greater than 12 months.
## (s4) Dietary Fibre

(p4.0) Dietary fibre provides a substrate for the bacteria that inhabit the distal gut, and these bacteria are integral to its handling. Humans produce approximately 17 enzymes to digest fibre. However, these bacteria produce thousands of complementary enzymes to depolymerise and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host absorbable SCFAs. These SCFAs include butyrate, propionate and acetate. Bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum that possess this capability are less abundant in the gut of IBD patients [26]. The IBD-altered microbiota composition results in lower production of anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory metabolites, in particular butyrate, a lack of which may contribute to increased intestinal inflammation [53].

(p5.0) Dietary fibre provides a substrate for the bacteria that inhabit the distal gut, and these bacteria are integral to its handling. Humans produce approximately 17 enzymes to digest fibre. However, these bacteria produce thousands of complementary enzymes to depolymerise and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host absorbable short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These SCFAs include butyrate, propionate and acetate. Bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum that possess this capability are less abundant in the gut of IBD patients [26]. The IBD-altered microbiota composition results in lower production of anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory metabolites, in particular butyrate, a lack of which may contribute to increased intestinal inflammation [53].

(p5.1) SCFAs reduce the inflammatory immune response through multiple mechanisms, including reducing the permeability of the intraepithelial barrier; interacting directly with immune cells and indirectly on the production of signaling cytokines and chemokines to collectively decrease proinflammatory mediators and increase immune-tolerant responses. The proposed mechanisms of these impacts are summarised in Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 1. Animal models of colitis have shown that dietary fibre intake is protective, particularly if given before the exposure leading to the development of colitis [54]. This may be mediated through the protection from disruption of the gut mucus layer that occurs during active disease [55]. Desai and colleagues demonstrated that fed a low-fibre diet, the gut microbiota in mice resorted to mucus layer glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a primary defence against enteric pathogens [56].

## (s19) Mediterranean Style Diet

(p19.0) A recent prospective cohort study examined the relationship between consumption of a Mediterranean diet (high in fruit, vegetables, PUFA and protein predominately from fish, legumes and nuts) and the risk of developing CD in a prospective cohort study of 83,147 Swedish adults [52]. They found a dose-effect relationship, with those most adherent to the Mediterranean diet having a lower risk of developing CD. A study examined the dietary intake of 39,511 young women during high school and subsequent development of IBD over 19 year follow up. They found that compared to women who consumed <10 g/day of fish during high school, those with an intake of â‰¥30 g/day had a 57% lower risk of CD [46]. Fish intake did not appear to modulate UC risk.
## (s22) Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN)

(p22.0) Dietary food components may contribute to the inflammatory processes during a flare of IBD. EEN is an elemental diet, which involves the provision of 100% of a person's nutritional requirement as a liquid nutrition formula delivered enterally (either orally or via nasogastric tube) over a period of 6-8 weeks [149]. The mechanism of its efficacy is still poorly understood. However, there are changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome [150]. EEN significantly decreases the gut bacterial diversity below pretreatment levels. One theory is that the bowel rest induced by EEN facilitates mucosal healing by limiting the activity of pathogenic microbes [149]. EEN has been found to be particularly beneficial in the paediatric setting and in CD rather than UC. A randomised controlled trial that looked at both clinical remission and mucosal healing at week 10 in a paediatric CD population comparing EEN and oral corticosteroids showed equivalent rates of clinical remission and superior rates of mucosal healing in the EEN group [143]. Studies looking at the utility of EEN in the adult IBD population have yielded less dramatic benefits. Meta-analyses on the topic have suggested that there is weak evidence of the benefit of EEN for the induction and maintenance of IBD remission compared to placebo in adult patients with CD, but not compared to corticosteroids [151,152]. One of the main barriers to efficacy is patient adherence to EEN therapy [144].
