## (s7) Phase Transition of Bulk SnSe
Number of References: 9

(p7.0) Chattopadhyay et al. conducted a preliminary investigation via energy dispersive Xray diffraction techniques to examine the behavior of SnSe, which revealed that the layered crystal structure exhibited stability up to a pressure of 34 GPa [59].Peters and McNeil et al. observed structural modifications in SnSe under pressures ranging from 1.4 to 3 GPa using Mossbauer measurements [57].These changes were attributed to the interlayer interactions, prompting the transition from a pseudo 2D structure to a 3D structure.Importantly, the structural characteristics of the Pnma space group were maintained during this transformation.In contrast, Alptekin et al. theoretically determined that a transition from the orthorhombic Pnma phase to the Cmcm phase occurs at 7 GPa [60].Loa et al. utilized angle-dispersive synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (ADXRD) to investigate the behavior of SnSe under pressure up to 10.5 GPa.They observed SnSe undergo a second-order phase transition from the orthorhombic Pnma structure to Bbmm, which is similar to Cmcm.This study represents the first instance of experimental evidence that supports the presence of a structural phase transition in bulk SnSe [61].Pal et al. also observed the structural phase transition in bulk SnSe through Raman scattering.As shown in Figure 3, two new modes (M8, M9) at 81.2 and 144.6 cm −1 emerged in the Raman spectra at 6.2 GPa and persisted up to 21 GPa, which is associated with the phase transition [62].observed structural modifications in SnSe under pressures ranging from 1.4 to 3 GPa using Mossbauer measurements [57].These changes were attributed to the interlayer interactions, prompting the transition from a pseudo 2D structure to a 3D structure.Importantly, the structural characteristics of the Pnma space group were maintained during this transformation.In contrast, Alptekin et al. theoretically determined that a transition from the orthorhombic Pnma phase to the Cmcm phase occurs at 7 GPa [60].Loa et al. utilized angledispersive synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (ADXRD) to investigate the behavior of SnSe under pressure up to 10.5 GPa.They observed SnSe undergo a second-order phase transition from the orthorhombic Pnma structure to Bbmm, which is similar to Cmcm.This study represents the first instance of experimental evidence that supports the presence of a structural phase transition in bulk SnSe [61].Pal et al. also observed the structural phase transition in bulk SnSe through Raman scattering.As shown in Figure 3, two new modes (M8, M9) at 81.2 and 144.6 cm −1 emerged in the Raman spectra at 6.2 GPa and persisted up to 21 GPa, which is associated with the phase transition [62].
## (s22) Anisotropic Thermoelectric Properties

(p22.0) In the early days, considerable attention was drawn to the remarkable thermoelectric properties of SnSe [58,126].Zhao et al. reported remarkably elevated ZT values for singlecrystalline SnSe at 923 K [29].It was as high as 2.6 ± 0.3 along the b-axis, 2.3 ± 0.3 along the c-axis, and 0.8 ± 0.2 along the a-axis.Carrete et al. observed the lattice thermal conductivity (κ l ) with κ l b > κ l c > κ l a at all temperatures by theoretical calculation [127].Ibrahim et al. reported that κ l presents an expressive anisotropy among the three directions (κ l c > κ l b > κ l a ) in undoped single-crystalline SnSe [128].Zhang et al. predicted the ZT values of P-type SnSe along the band c-axis can reach 2.5 and 1.7 at 6 GPa and 700 K, respectively.However, the a-axis showed N-type SnSe with ZT value of 1.7 at 6 GPa and 600 K.The improvement in thermoelectric properties can be attributed to the alteration of electronic structures under pressure [129].Gusãmo et al. investigated the impact of pressures (0-10 GPa) on the thermoelectric properties of Pnma-SnSe [130].As shown in Figure 12a-e, the Seebeck coefficient exhibited a continuous decrease along the a-axis, which attributes this rapid decrease and signal modification to the increasing thermally excited negative electrons owing to the decrease in the energy band gap with P-type SnSe [131].In Figure 12f-i, it is evident that the ZT decreases with increasing pressure, signifying that external pressure has a diminishing effect on the efficiency of the conversion of thermal energy to electrical energy.Yu et al. reported the anisotropy and thermoelectric parameters of the Pnma and Cmcm phases exhibit notable differences [132].As shown in Figure 13, the overall effect of 4 GPa pressure on the power factor is small, but it does not significantly increase the lattice thermal conductivity, which is conducive to the enhancement of ZT value.
