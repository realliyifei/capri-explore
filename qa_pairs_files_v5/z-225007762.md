## (s18) The Influence of Group Affiliation and Networks on the Intensity of CSR Implementation
Number of References: 24

(p18.0) The literature on the relation between BG affiliation and CSR intensity features mixed evidence, the majority of which, however, is positive. Compared to stand-alone firms, group affiliation normally resulted in better CSR performance overall, including environmental, social and governance ratings (ESG-a proxy for CSR but based on more precise criteria for assessment), and for its individual social and environmental components [5,6,[59][60][61]. The social score seems to yield an even stronger effect in larger groups and for such dimensions as employment, human rights, community and product responsibility, but less in terms of safety, training and diversity. Concerning the environmental aspect, remission and resource reduction, as well as product innovation/R&D are the factors responsible for raising CSR intensity in BGs [59,60].

(p18.1) Conversely, other studies suggested that publicly listed groups in particular do not aggressively invest in CSR activities [62], and that the higher cost of equity for disclosing nonfinancial information, makes CSR reporting less valuable to BGs [63].

(p18.2) As for the positive BG-CSR correlation, this depends on the intrinsic characteristics of BGs themselves. First of all, size (several companies in one group) and years of experience significantly affect corporate sustainability. Specifically, larger and older BGs have a higher availability of resources, therefore it is easier for them to invest in CSR [59,64].

(p18.3) Second, the support provided by BG promoters (families or controlling corporations) is equally important. Unlike the promoters of unaffiliated firms (individuals), which are exclusively interested in profits, promoters of BGs are genetically interlinked with society, and thus feel compelled to also nurture socio-economic wealth [61]. Family control, counter to the belief that it is only a source of opportunistic expropriation of CSR investments, proved to be an excellent leverage for increasing a BG's environmental disclosure propensity, mainly if leadership is taken by a family CEO [64]. Some authors, however, state that it is group affiliation itself that mitigates the negative effects of family ownership on CSR, and this is only true for non-individual family owners [5]. As for controlling companies, they exert significant influence on subsidiaries, both if these operate in their parent company's sector, or in a different industry but with notable direction and coordination by the holding. This leads affiliated firms to adopt their same sustainability practices and improves their individual corporate social disclosure, demonstrating that a BG is indeed a united economic entity, even when it comes to sustainability performance [65]. Peer pressure by likewise affiliated firms plays an influential role too. As a matter of fact, if some affiliates already have previously disclosed environmental information, the disclosure propensity among the other group members increases [64]. The external BG influence dynamic is also to be noted. When it comes to the promotion of socio-economic wealth, BGs can truly make a difference, as they wield considerable political power in shaping the local legal framework for their respective societal contexts, thanks to collaborations with governments [66]. Their sustainable business operations often inspire other BGs to transition towards CS too [6].

(p18.4) BGs do not primarily resort to CSR-related tools to address narrowly defined environmental issues; they instead rely on its insurance-like effect to obtain reputational gains [59,64]. Sustaining or restoring group reputation is particularly important during negative group-specific externalities (e.g., dissemination of bad news among member firms) [59], as well as when members need to be protected from inherent reputational risks emerging from embezzlement schemes potentially put in place by family owners [64]. A good reputation particularly helps BGs to convince international stakeholders during the internationalization process, when they have a tendency to communicate more CSR activities [67]. The one case mentioned in which BGs do not need to worry about recognition is when they hold the dual status of state-owned BG. These organizations are in fact naturally afforded both legitimacy and protection from negative CSR performance, making them less compelled to conduct sustainability-related activities to maintain their reputation [68].
## (s20) CSR Processes in SME Networks and Corporate Groups

(p20.0) In general, cooperative and community-based approaches to CSR (e.g., strategic alliances) between multiple SMEs, like in the case of networks/clusters and BGs, lead to major advantages for the individual firms taking part in them, not only in short-term economic terms but also from a long-term strategic perspective, by simplifying the implementation of sustainability management policies and helping to maintain the relative tools over time [94]. The following section analyzes how some of the sustainability tools from the previous section were extended to an entire group or network. For this purpose, it will be useful to understand how a BG relates to a network. Groups of companies, in fact, can be seen as having two layers of independent networks: the inter-organizational network, represented by the headquarters and branch offices (core BG), and the intra-organizational network, consisting of the core company, as well as suppliers and associated firms sharing the same goal. One of the articles used these definitions to illustrate the process of knowledge creation for the implementation of a network-wide environmental policy for "zero emissions". After the initial direction provided by top management in announcing the program for environmental management, middle management organized information flows about the new policy from branch offices to construction sites, hauliers and subcontractors in their allocated sites. This drove the arrangement of the inter-organizational network towards stronger ties (more qualitative information and cooperation, decreased opportunism) and density (shared norms and reputational monitoring), as well as effective externalization and socialization of BG's sense of CSR value. Then, middle management emphasized the centrality of corporate headquarters by serving as mediators between them, the construction managers of each branch office and the staff from the environmental improvement department. This bridging led to the sharing and combination of concrete knowledge for setting a proper path for CSR development. Next, branch office managers encouraged hauliers and subcontractors to design, test and share information on environmental management, externalizing the process to the entire intra-organizational network. Then, they helped supervise this process and provided operative training, internalizing this whole approach [100].
