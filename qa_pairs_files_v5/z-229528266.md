## (s8) Effect of Disinfectants on COVID-19 Virus
Number of References: 7

(p8.0) Detailed information about the level of resistance of COVID-19 in the environment is not available, but it seems to behave like other CoVs [72]. Recent studies have shown that the resistance of human CoVs such as SARS-CoV, MERS, and other endemic human CoV, is varied in different surfaces (from 2 h to 9 days) [72], [73]. The survival time of these viruses is affected by many factors such as surface structure, temperature, relative humidity, and type of virus species so that on inanimate surfaces such as metals, glass, and plastics can survive up to 9 days [72], [73].

(p8.1) Unfortunately, there is little information about the suitable disinfectant for confrontation to COVID-19. However, experts believe that effective disinfectants on other CoVs can also be effective to inactivate COVID-19 virus. There is a wide range of disinfectants for surface disinfection. Ethanol 62-71%, hydrogenperoxide 0.5%, and sodium hypochlorite 0.1% can effectively disable the CoVs during 1 min [74]. The WHO believes that a wide range of disinfectants is effective for enveloped viruses such as COVID-19 virus. At present, 70% ethyl alcohol recommends for disinfection of small areas between uses such as reusable equipment (e.g., thermometer). Sodium hypochlorite at 0.5% (equivalent 5000 ppm) is recommended for disinfection of surfaces [72].
