(p0.0) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of disability in young adults. Irreversible axonal damage occurs even in the earliest phases of disease evolution [1]. Although some people with relapsing√Äremitting MS (RRMS) have a 'benign' disease course with minimal disease activity and impairment, most patients experience increasing disability over time and eventually convert to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). There is still no curative treatment, but during the last 20 years eight different therapies have become available including interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, fingolimod, alemtuzumab and mitoxantrone, and several new compounds are in development. All the approved medications have mainly anti-inflammatory effects and increasing evidence indicates that all of them are more effective in the early phases of disease development [2,3]. With the development of more effective treatments, the aim of treatment has changed dramatically in the last decades, from simply reducing relapse rates and slowing of disability progression to preventing all evidence of new disease activity [4]. In the current review, the mode of action and documented effect of the current immunomodulatory MS therapies are briefly discussed.
