(p23.0) Single and sequential applications of rimsulfuron between 20 and 50 g a.i./ha significantly reduced O. ramosa shoot number and dry weight. Three applications were most effective (Haidar et al., 2005b). Best results on Orobanche control and potato selectivity were obtained with rimsulfuron (12.5 g a.i./ha) followed by sequential 3 foliar application of glyphosate at 100 g a.i./ha (Haidar et al., 2005b). Orobanche aegyptiaca and O. ramosa were controlled in potato-infested soils by split foliar applications of low rates of imazapic and rimsulfuron. Three applications of imazapic at 4.5 g/ha each, after crop emergence and reapplied at 2-week intervals, prevented Orobanche infestation (Goldwasser et al., 2001).
