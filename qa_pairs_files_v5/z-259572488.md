(p16.0) The application of Coarse-to-Fine Pseudo Supervision-guided Meta-Learning (C2FPS-ML) for unsupervised multiple-shot object classification is used to solve target tasks that have few labeled examples with additional unlabeled datasets. The method acquires prior knowledge from the additional unlabeled dataset during unsupervised meta-training. It then uses the prior knowledge to assist downstream multi-shot classification tasks. Optimization of the meta-task sampling process at the unsupervised meta-training stage using the Coarse to Fine Pseudo Supervision method in C2FPS-ML which is the dominant factor to improve the performance of meta-learning-based FSL algorithms. Learning new concepts in a progressive or hierarchical manner following the coarsest to finest way can use human behavior simulation as a development step of the C2FPS-ML method [28], [29], [30].
