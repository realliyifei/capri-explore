(p0.0) It is well known that the global climate will become warmer in the future, and many researchers have estimated that the occurrence of heat waves and their adverse effects will be exacerbated by this increase in global temperature [1,2]. Heat waves can result in high numbers of heat-related illnesses and deaths. In 1980, a heat wave killed approximately 10,000 people across the United States [3]. In July of 1995, a heat wave also killed more than 700 people in Chicago [4], and in August of 2003, a heat wave killed more than 70,000 people in Europe [5]. Furthermore, extreme heat has been found to be the deadliest weather-related hazard in some locations [6,7]. People with respiratory or cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes, chronic mental disorders or other pre-existing medical conditions are at greatest risk of being negatively affected by heat waves [8,9]. Individuals who are elderly, are socially isolated, have a low income, are uneducated, or live in low-income housing are also at greater risk [10,11].

(p0.1) The adverse health effects that result from extreme heat can be prevented. Some cities that implement hot weather response measures during heat waves have experienced decreases in the morbidity and mortality of heat-related illnesses [12,13]. A review of emergency response plans found that half of the studied cities had specific plans for extreme heat events but that few cities had interventions to reach the at-risk populations [14,15]. To more effectively prevent heat hazards, it is important to determine both the regions and those people within the regions who are at an increased risk of being negatively affected by heat waves [16][17][18].
