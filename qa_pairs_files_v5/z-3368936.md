(p0.0) Women are at risk to develop depression after childbirth, also known as the postpartum period [1]. Postpartum depression (PPD), defined as nonpsychotic depression occurring up to 1 year after childbirth, is a "crippling mood disorder that erodes away at the joy and happiness of new mothers" [2][3][4]. PPD is recognized as an international public health concern. There is an estimated prevalence of PPD of 10-20% among mothers in Western countries [5][6][7]. The few studies that have examined PPD prevalence in developing countries show similar or higher prevalence of this condition [5,6,8,9]. If undiagnosed and/or untreated, PPD can adversely affect the mother and child, as well as the mother-child relationship [3]. For the mother, PPD has a deleterious effect on all social and familial relationships, functional status (including impaired parenting behaviors), and ability to care for the infant and herself, including increasing the risk of the mother harming herself. Maternal suicides account for up to 20% of all postpartum deaths [10,11]. The infant is at increased risk for long-term health and developmental problems (including cognitive, language, and school delays) and behavioral issues [1,2,4,12].
