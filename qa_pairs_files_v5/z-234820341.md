(p4.0) In this study, only two articles were found to adopt the traditional perspective of value as a net benefit, i.e. as a "tradeoff between benefits and sacrifices" (Zeithaml, 1988). In particular, Olaru et al. (2008) focused on an R&D service and framed the sacrifices in terms of monetary expenditure and time, and the benefits in terms of relationship and service quality. Luu et al. (2016) investigated B2B relationships in a transportation and logistics service, and defined value through two different perspectives, process value and outcome value. In the process value, benefits were measured as the positive experience perceived by the customers during the service process, while in the outcome value benefits related to the positive experience the customers perceive when the service It is interesting that only two articles used the traditional definition of customer value in relation to inter-organizational relationships. This result suggests that other conceptualizations of customer value were found more appropriate by scholars to investigate the inter-organizational context, at least staring from the 1990s.
