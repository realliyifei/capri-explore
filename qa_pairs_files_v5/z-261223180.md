## (s12) Corticosteroid (CS) treatment Promotion of foetal lung maturation in threatening preterm delivery
Number of References: 92

(p12.0) Irrespective of the underlying condition, preterm delivery (< 37 weeks' gestation) carries the risk of RDS in neonates because of insufficient surfactant production in foetal lungs. The neonates can be treated with CS and surfactant. Prenatal CS treatment has been shown to accelerate foetal lung maturation through a complex interaction of hormonal and intercellular signalling that leads to differentiation of the surfactant lipid-protein pathway and through less well-defined increases in lung compliance [103]. The foetal lung must be biologically ready for a CS to "trigger" maturation. In humans this window of biological readiness of the lungs seems to occur most often between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation [103].

(p12.1) Recently, betamethasone, instead of dexamethasone, has been recommended as a drug of choice for promotion of foetal lung maturation in threatening preterm delivery [104]. In clinical trials as well as observational studies antenatal CS treatment is associated with a decreased risk of IVH and CP [105]. Betamethasone may be safer and more protective of the immature brain than dexamethasone [106].

(p12.2) In a retrospective cohort study by Baud et al. comprising 883 infants with gestational age between 24 and 31 weeks it was reported an odds ratio (OR) for cystic periventricular leucomalacia of 0.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.9) for betamethasone compared with no treatment and 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.9) for the dexamethasone treated group [107]. Treatment of severe preeclampsia with betamethasone in the time span between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of RDS, IVH and perinatal death in preterm delivery [108]. A Cochrane update from 2006 advocated a single course of antenatal CS (12 mg betamethasone twice) in gestational ages between the 26th and 35th gestational weeks [109]. Thus, a single course of CS is advocated in threatening preterm delivery, including severe preeclampsia.

(p12.3) Multiple courses are more effective, but may harm the foetus Two randomized trials of women at risk of preterm delivery showed that weekly CS caused less RDS, less severe neonatal lung disease and serious neonatal morbidity and less need for mechanical respiratory support and surfactant use [110,111]. The short-term benefits supported the use of repeated doses of CS in women who remain at risk of very preterm birth 7 or more days after an initial course. However, both studies raised serious concerns about lower neonatal birth weight in the repeat course group [110,111]. Two long-term follow-up studies have been presented [112,113]. One favours the use of repeated CS courses [112]. In the other a non-significant higher rate of CP was detected in the repeat group (6 versus 1) and it was concluded that present findings indicate no evident long-term benefit, rather a possible harm, arguing that weekly administration of antenatal CS should not be offered after an initial course [113]. Repeated CS exposure may increase mortality, restrict foetal growth and cause prolonged foetal adrenal suppression [114,115]. Both repeat maternal CS exposure and early neonatal dexamethasone treatment may cause CP in preterm neonates [113,116,117]. An increase in the prev-alence of CP among very preterm deliveries (time span 24 to 30 weeks of gestational age) has been reported. Postnatal dexamethasone treatment was associated with higher rates of CP, whereas antenatal CS treatment was associated with lower rates [117]. Early dexamethasone treatment should not be recommended for the routine prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease [118].

## (s15) High-dose dexamethasone treatment of maternal HELLP
Number of References: 52

(p15.0) Retrospective and small randomized studies suggested that the use of high-dose dexamethasone (10 mg dexamethasone every12 hours) in the HELLP syndrome reduced maternal morbidity and induced more rapid improvement of the PLT counts. Thereby the rate of regional anaesthesia could be increased, consequently allowing vaginal delivery [27,87,[123][124][125][126][127][128]. In a publication from 2006 by Martin et al. (based on retrospective analysis and referring to experience and publications and 2 small randomised studies in the antepartum period that reported less morbidity in the treatment group), aggressive use of potent GS was recommended as a cornerstone of management for women with the HELLP syndrome class 1 and 2 or for women with class 3 HELLP syndrome accompanied with epigastric pain, eclampsia, severe hypertension or evidence of major organ morbidity [7]. CS treatment was recommended only as short-term intervention. Continuation of pregnancy for more than 48 hours after CS administration for very preterm HELLP syndrome can lead to significant maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality [7,129].

(p15.1) The largest randomized double blind, placebo controlled (dexamethasone versus placebo) study so far by Fonseca et al. included 132 women with the HELLP syndrome. The study included both HELLP occurring in pregnancy (n = 60) and after delivery (n = 72) [130]. This study could not confirm favorable results of previous small studies. Dexamethasone treatment did not reduce maternal complications (such as acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema and oliguria). The rates of platelets and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were not significantly reduced, nor was the time of recovery of laboratory test shortened, or the duration of hospital stay. The results of this study did not support the routine use of high-dose dexamethasone [130].

## (s19) Timing and mode of delivery
Number of References: 8

(p19.0) We have not identified any randomized trial comparing maternal and neonatal outcome after vaginal delivery or Caesarean section for women with the HELLP syndrome. The indication of delivery, timing and method of delivery of the HELLP syndrome is more or less depending on experience and local traditions and there is no general agreement. A woman with a class 3 HELLP syndrome could await spontaneous onset of delivery at term [15]. Pregnant women with moderate (class 2), complete or severe (class 1) HELLP syndrome with completed 34 weeks' gestation should be delivered immediately after control of maternal hypertension [15]. The route of delivery should be selected on obstetric indications including cervical status, obstetric history, the maternal and the foetal condition. If the cervix is unfavourable for induction of labour, cervical ripening should be the first step [21].

(p19.1) Before 34 weeks' gestation, delivery should be chosen if the maternal condition cannot be controlled rapidly, if the maternal condition worsens or signs of intrauterine foetal distress develop. Maternal indications for immedi-ate delivery include blood pressure > 160/110 mmHg despite treatment with antihypertensive drugs, persisting or worsening clinical symptoms, deteriorating renal function, severe ascites, abruptio placentae, oliguria, pulmonary oedema or eclampsia [72]. In such cases most clinicians probably will prefer Caesarean section.
## (s20) Management of post-partum HELLP syndrome
Number of References: 88

(p20.0) In most women with a HELLP syndrome, the maternal PLT counts continue to decrease immediately post-partum with an increasing trend on the third day [6]. About 30% of the HELLP syndromes develop after birth; the majority within the first 48 hours. However, the time of onset might range from a few hours to 7 days after delivery [10]. In women with post-partum HELLP syndrome, risk of renal failure and pulmonary oedema is significantly increased compared to those with an antenatal onset [59,86]. Since early post-partum administration of highdose CS might accelerate recovery [128], its routine administration is highly advocated (10 mg of dexamethasone every 12 hours) [6,[144][145][146].

(p20.1) However, a randomized study showed that adjunctive use of intravenous dexamethasone for postpartum patients with severe preeclampsia did not reduce disease severity or duration [147]. Moreover, the benefit of dexamethasone in post-partum HELLP syndrome was not verified in a randomized placebo controlled trial on 105 women with postpartum HELLP syndrome. There was no difference in maternal morbidity, duration of hospital stay, need for rescue scheme or the use of blood products between the groups, nor was there any difference with respect to the pattern of PLT count, recovery, AST, LDH, haemoglobin or diuresis. These findings did not support the use of dexamethasone in the puerperium for recovery of women with HELLP [148].

(p20.2) Women with a HELLP syndrome who demonstrate progressive elevation of bilirubin or creatinine for more than 72 hours after delivery may benefit from plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma [149][150][151]. In the case of continuing haemolysis, persistent thrombocytopenia and hypoproteinaemia, post-partum erythrocyte and thrombocyte substitution, as well as albumin supplementation, are standard treatment regimens [5,21]. In a recent study of women with class 1 HELLP syndrome adding of platelet transfusion to standard CS administration did not increase the recovery rate [152]. Ertan et al. treated women with diuresis problems in the postpartum period with furosemide and applied prophylaxis with antithrombin or low-dose heparin for DIC [5]. A meta-analysis concluded that furosemide was not beneficial to prevent or treat acute renal failure in adults [153]. Too little fluid can exacerbate an already vasoconstricted intravascular volume and lead to renal injury in severe preeclampsia or in the HELLP syndrome. A bolus intravenous fluid of 250-500 ml is advocated if oliguria persists, and, if necessary, central monitoring of the patient [6].

(p20.3) Some patients with the HELLP syndrome, especially those with DIC, may demonstrate delayed resolution or even deterioration in the post-partum period [101]. Therefore, the use of heparin has been proposed for patients with preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome and DIC. A retrospective analysis of women with DIC in the post-partum period revealed that 6 of 9 developed post-partum bleeding including retroperitoneal haematoma. Treatment with heparin was discouraged for post-partum bleeding [84]. Thus, most authors oppose the routine use of heparin.

(p20.4) In most women with a HELLP syndrome, the maternal PLT counts continue to decrease immediately post-partum with an increasing trend on the third day [6]. About 30% of the HELLP syndromes develop after birth; the majority within the first 48 hours. However, the time of onset might range from a few hours to 7 days after delivery [10]. In women with post-partum HELLP syndrome, risk of renal failure and pulmonary oedema is significantly increased compared to those with an antenatal onset [59,86]. Since early post-partum administration of highdose CS might accelerate recovery [128], its routine administration is highly advocated (10 mg of dexamethasone every 12 hours) [6,[144][145][146].

(p20.5) However, a randomized study showed that adjunctive use of intravenous dexamethasone for postpartum patients with severe preeclampsia did not reduce disease severity or duration [147]. Moreover, the benefit of dexamethasone in post-partum HELLP syndrome was not verified in a randomized placebo controlled trial on 105 women with postpartum HELLP syndrome. There was no difference in maternal morbidity, duration of hospital stay, need for rescue scheme or the use of blood products between the groups, nor was there any difference with respect to the pattern of PLT count, recovery, AST, LDH, haemoglobin or diuresis.

(p21.0) Sibai has shown that oral contraceptives are safe in women with a prior HELLP syndrome [8]. Women with a history of the HELLP syndrome carry an increased risk of at least 20% (range 5-52%) that some form of gestational hypertension will recur in a subsequent gestation [7,11,101,142,154].

(p21.1) In a subsequent pregnancy, women with a history of HELLP syndrome at or before 28 weeks' gestation during the index pregnancy are at increased risk for several obstetric complications (preterm birth, pregnancy-induced hypertension and increased neonatal mortality) [154]. In patients with prior severe, early-onset preeclampsia thrombophilia screening has been suggested and should include search for protein S deficiency, activated protein C resistance (APC resistance), hyperhomocysteinemia and anti-phospholipid antibodies (both lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anti-cardiolipin) [155].

## (s38) Corticosteroid (CS) treatment Promotion of foetal lung maturation in threatening preterm delivery
Number of References: 92

(p38.0) Irrespective of the underlying condition, preterm delivery (< 37 weeks' gestation) carries the risk of RDS in neonates because of insufficient surfactant production in foetal lungs. The neonates can be treated with CS and surfactant. Prenatal CS treatment has been shown to accelerate foetal lung maturation through a complex interaction of hormonal and intercellular signalling that leads to differentiation of the surfactant lipid-protein pathway and through less well-defined increases in lung compliance [103]. The foetal lung must be biologically ready for a CS to "trigger" maturation. In humans this window of biological readiness of the lungs seems to occur most often between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation [103].

(p38.1) Recently, betamethasone, instead of dexamethasone, has been recommended as a drug of choice for promotion of foetal lung maturation in threatening preterm delivery [104]. In clinical trials as well as observational studies antenatal CS treatment is associated with a decreased risk of IVH and CP [105]. Betamethasone may be safer and more protective of the immature brain than dexamethasone [106].

(p38.2) In a retrospective cohort study by Baud et al. comprising 883 infants with gestational age between 24 and 31 weeks it was reported an odds ratio (OR) for cystic periventricular leucomalacia of 0.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.9) for betamethasone compared with no treatment and 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.9) for the dexamethasone treated group [107]. Treatment of severe preeclampsia with betamethasone in the time span between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of RDS, IVH and perinatal death in preterm delivery [108]. A Cochrane update from 2006 advocated a single course of antenatal CS (12 mg betamethasone twice) in gestational ages between the 26th and 35th gestational weeks [109]. Thus, a single course of CS is advocated in threatening preterm delivery, including severe preeclampsia.

(p38.3) Multiple courses are more effective, but may harm the foetus Two randomized trials of women at risk of preterm delivery showed that weekly CS caused less RDS, less severe neonatal lung disease and serious neonatal morbidity and less need for mechanical respiratory support and surfactant use [110,111]. The short-term benefits supported the use of repeated doses of CS in women who remain at risk of very preterm birth 7 or more days after an initial course. However, both studies raised serious concerns about lower neonatal birth weight in the repeat course group [110,111]. Two long-term follow-up studies have been presented [112,113]. One favours the use of repeated CS courses [112]. In the other a non-significant higher rate of CP was detected in the repeat group (6 versus 1) and it was concluded that present findings indicate no evident long-term benefit, rather a possible harm, arguing that weekly administration of antenatal CS should not be offered after an initial course [113]. Repeated CS exposure may increase mortality, restrict foetal growth and cause prolonged foetal adrenal suppression [114,115]. Both repeat maternal CS exposure and early neonatal dexamethasone treatment may cause CP in preterm neonates [113,116,117]. An increase in the prev-alence of CP among very preterm deliveries (time span 24 to 30 weeks of gestational age) has been reported. Postnatal dexamethasone treatment was associated with higher rates of CP, whereas antenatal CS treatment was associated with lower rates [117]. Early dexamethasone treatment should not be recommended for the routine prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease [118].

## (s41) High-dose dexamethasone treatment of maternal HELLP
Number of References: 52

(p41.0) Retrospective and small randomized studies suggested that the use of high-dose dexamethasone (10 mg dexamethasone every12 hours) in the HELLP syndrome reduced maternal morbidity and induced more rapid improvement of the PLT counts. Thereby the rate of regional anaesthesia could be increased, consequently allowing vaginal delivery [27,87,[123][124][125][126][127][128]. In a publication from 2006 by Martin et al. (based on retrospective analysis and referring to experience and publications and 2 small randomised studies in the antepartum period that reported less morbidity in the treatment group), aggressive use of potent GS was recommended as a cornerstone of management for women with the HELLP syndrome class 1 and 2 or for women with class 3 HELLP syndrome accompanied with epigastric pain, eclampsia, severe hypertension or evidence of major organ morbidity [7]. CS treatment was recommended only as short-term intervention. Continuation of pregnancy for more than 48 hours after CS administration for very preterm HELLP syndrome can lead to significant maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality [7,129].

(p41.1) The largest randomized double blind, placebo controlled (dexamethasone versus placebo) study so far by Fonseca et al. included 132 women with the HELLP syndrome. The study included both HELLP occurring in pregnancy (n = 60) and after delivery (n = 72) [130]. This study could not confirm favorable results of previous small studies. Dexamethasone treatment did not reduce maternal complications (such as acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema and oliguria). The rates of platelets and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were not significantly reduced, nor was the time of recovery of laboratory test shortened, or the duration of hospital stay. The results of this study did not support the routine use of high-dose dexamethasone [130].

The indication of delivery, timing and method of delivery of the HELLP syndrome is more or less depending on experience and local traditions and there is no general agreement. A woman with a class 3 HELLP syndrome could await spontaneous onset of delivery at term [15].

If the cervix is unfavourable for induction of labour, cervical ripening should be the first step [21].

(p45.1) Before 34 weeks' gestation, delivery should be chosen if the maternal condition cannot be controlled rapidly, if the maternal condition worsens or signs of intrauterine foetal distress develop. Maternal indications for immedi-ate delivery include blood pressure > 160/110 mmHg despite treatment with antihypertensive drugs, persisting or worsening clinical symptoms, deteriorating renal function, severe ascites, abruptio placentae, oliguria, pulmonary oedema or eclampsia [72]. In such cases most clinicians probably will prefer Caesarean section.
## (s46) Management of post-partum HELLP syndrome
Number of References: 88

(p46.0) In most women with a HELLP syndrome, the maternal PLT counts continue to decrease immediately post-partum with an increasing trend on the third day [6]. About 30% of the HELLP syndromes develop after birth; the majority within the first 48 hours. However, the time of onset might range from a few hours to 7 days after delivery [10]. In women with post-partum HELLP syndrome, risk of renal failure and pulmonary oedema is significantly increased compared to those with an antenatal onset [59,86]. Since early post-partum administration of highdose CS might accelerate recovery [128], its routine administration is highly advocated (10 mg of dexamethasone every 12 hours) [6,[144][145][146].

(p46.1) However, a randomized study showed that adjunctive use of intravenous dexamethasone for postpartum patients with severe preeclampsia did not reduce disease severity or duration [147]. Moreover, the benefit of dexamethasone in post-partum HELLP syndrome was not verified in a randomized placebo controlled trial on 105 women with postpartum HELLP syndrome. There was no difference in maternal morbidity, duration of hospital stay, need for rescue scheme or the use of blood products between the groups, nor was there any difference with respect to the pattern of PLT count, recovery, AST, LDH, haemoglobin or diuresis. These findings did not support the use of dexamethasone in the puerperium for recovery of women with HELLP [148].

(p46.2) Women with a HELLP syndrome who demonstrate progressive elevation of bilirubin or creatinine for more than 72 hours after delivery may benefit from plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma [149][150][151]. In the case of continuing haemolysis, persistent thrombocytopenia and hypoproteinaemia, post-partum erythrocyte and thrombocyte substitution, as well as albumin supplementation, are standard treatment regimens [5,21]. In a recent study of women with class 1 HELLP syndrome adding of platelet transfusion to standard CS administration did not increase the recovery rate [152]. Ertan et al. treated women with diuresis problems in the postpartum period with furosemide and applied prophylaxis with antithrombin or low-dose heparin for DIC [5]. A meta-analysis concluded that furosemide was not beneficial to prevent or treat acute renal failure in adults [153]. Too little fluid can exacerbate an already vasoconstricted intravascular volume and lead to renal injury in severe preeclampsia or in the HELLP syndrome. A bolus intravenous fluid of 250-500 ml is advocated if oliguria persists, and, if necessary, central monitoring of the patient [6].

(p46.3) Some patients with the HELLP syndrome, especially those with DIC, may demonstrate delayed resolution or even deterioration in the post-partum period [101]. Therefore, the use of heparin has been proposed for patients with preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome and DIC. A retrospective analysis of women with DIC in the post-partum period revealed that 6 of 9 developed post-partum bleeding including retroperitoneal haematoma. Treatment with heparin was discouraged for post-partum bleeding [84]. Thus, most authors oppose the routine use of heparin.

(p47.0) Sibai has shown that oral contraceptives are safe in women with a prior HELLP syndrome [8]. Women with a history of the HELLP syndrome carry an increased risk of at least 20% (range 5-52%) that some form of gestational hypertension will recur in a subsequent gestation [7,11,101,142,154].

(p47.1) In a subsequent pregnancy, women with a history of HELLP syndrome at or before 28 weeks' gestation during the index pregnancy are at increased risk for several obstetric complications (preterm birth, pregnancy-induced hypertension and increased neonatal mortality) [154]. In patients with prior severe, early-onset preeclampsia thrombophilia screening has been suggested and should include search for protein S deficiency, activated protein C resistance (APC resistance), hyperhomocysteinemia and anti-phospholipid antibodies (both lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anti-cardiolipin) [155].
