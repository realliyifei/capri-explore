(p7.0) Recently, numerous outbreaks have been linked to crosscontaminated, reusable, patient-ready RFBs, entailing significant cost and potentially health-related quality of life decrement (Mangen et al., 2017;Mouritsen et al., 2020). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the actual cross-contamination rate of RFBs. This study estimated the RFB cross-contamination rate based on the best available evidence via a systematic literature review. In all, eight studies were identified utilising PRISMA, and the estimated total cross-contamination rate was 8.69% via a random effect model. To our best knowledge, this is the first metaanalysis to estimate the total cross-contamination rate of RFBs, including a standardised contamination threshold based on a well-established endoscopy surveillance-testing guideline (Beilenhoff et al., 2007). This result clearly shows that despite continuous improvement in reprocessing and reprocessing guidelines, the RFB cross-contamination rate is still high. By proving this, it is evident that an infection control paradigm shift is needed to ensure patient safety.
