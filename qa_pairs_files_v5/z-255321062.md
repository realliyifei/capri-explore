(p11.0) An open-ended question was posed to respondents about their perceived major reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in their country. The responses were reviewed to extract themes using directed content analysis [21]. The codebook was created after a primary search of the literature of the concepts and causes of vaccine hesitancy. Two coders (HL and DP) were used to establish trustworthiness of the qualitative findings [22]; they met to review and consolidate coding and reconcile any differences. Coding disputes were resolved through discussion with the co-author (PSP). A visual representation of the text that appeared more frequently was generated using Python 3.9.
