## (s5) Resource theories
Number of References: 16

(p5.0) The resource theories are namely the resource-based view theory and resource dependence theory. The resource dependence theory is based on the notion that board members whose role is vested in advising and counselling the company owners (Zahra & Pearce, 1989), provide experience and expertise, facilitate better access to resources outside the company, and influence strategic decisions (Hillman & Dalziel, 2003). Resource-based view theory posit that firms stand to benefit and sustain competitive advantages by constructing and employing valuable resources and capabilities which are outside the firm's environment (Collins, 2021;Zawawi et al., 2016). The two theories are discussed below.

LLM judge: NO

The analysis reveals that the content does not meet the criteria for suitability due to the following reasons: 

1. The content lacks coherence and logical connection between multiple paragraphs (p5.0 and p5.1) since they are identical, suggesting a possible error in content extraction or duplication that does not add value or new information. 

2. The content promises further discussion ("The two theories are discussed below.") that is not provided, making it not self-contained and violating the requirement for providing clarity and understanding without the need for the full paper's context.

3. It includes a superficial overview without delving into specific details or examples that illustrate the application or implications of the theories mentioned, making it less effective for crafting a comprehensive question based on summary information.

These issues prevent the creation of a question that would encapsively summarize the content while adhering to the established criteria for a scientific question-answering dataset.

## (s8) Legitimacy theory
Number of References: 4

(p8.0) Suchman (1995) defines legitimacy as "a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions". Legitimacy theory proposes the concept of a "social contract" existing between organisations and society at large, which further helps in the environmental and social disclosures (Choi, Lee, & Psaros, 2013). Firms convince stakeholders that their activities are in line with stakeholders' expectations concerning carbon emissions to legitimise themselves and to keep the social contract (Kılıç & Kuzey, 2019; Yunus, Evangeline, & Abhayawansa, 2016). By doing so, the company asserts itself in the community as a responsible and legitimate company that is doing well for society.

LLM judge: NO

The content is repetitive, with paragraphs p8.0 and p8.1 being identical. This duplication suggests an error in content extraction or presentation, failing criteria 1 for having cohesive, uninterrupted text and criteria 6 for maintaining coherence and logical connection between multiple paragraphs, as there is no logical progression but rather a repetition of the same content. Additionally, this repetition could confuse readers or users of a dataset, making it inappropriate for inclusion without clarification or correction.

## (s21) Topics discussed
Number of References: 4

(p21.0) Several topics are discussed in corporate governance and organisational performance. These range from internal corporate governance, which includes board activities, number of board members, gender diversity, racial diversity, CEO duality, board meetings, board committees, board compensation, board qualifications, board experience, board independence, and board leadership (Abdullah, 2004 Sengupta, Ruj, & Bit, 2020), however, beneficiaries are those that enjoy early adoption. They lead change and others follow. The Fourth Industrial Revolution promises fundamental changes in the economy and business with enormous profits to be made. Companies that adopt these gradual changes will become learning organisations of the future which will change the manner we see the world very shortly. It will change all aspects of life and how business is conducted. Firm performance and corporate governance must therefore evolve to accept these fundamental changes in the structure of the economy.

LLM judge: NO

The content does not meet criteria 1, as it appears to be a repeated paragraph with identical text, suggesting an error in extraction or formatting. This repetition does not aid in establishing a cohesive narrative or providing new information in the second instance, which impacts the overall coherence and self-contained nature required by criteria 5 and 6. Additionally, while the text is relatively clear and free of non-textual elements, the repetition undermines its utility for inclusion in a question-answering dataset, as it fails to expand or provide depth on the topic discussed.

## (s38) Resource theories

(p38.0) The resource theories are namely the resource-based view theory and resource dependence theory. The resource dependence theory is based on the notion that board members whose role is vested in advising and counselling the company owners (Zahra & Pearce, 1989), provide experience and expertise, facilitate better access to resources outside the company, and influence strategic decisions (Hillman & Dalziel, 2003). Resource-based view theory posit that firms stand to benefit and sustain competitive advantages by constructing and employing valuable resources and capabilities which are outside the firm's environment (Collins, 2021;Zawawi et al., 2016). The two theories are discussed below.

LLM judge: NO

The analysis shows that the content appears as a repetition of the same paragraph twice, which fails the criteria for being cohesive and logical in progression. It does not provide a self-contained explanation or discussion of the two theories as mentioned but merely introduces them, failing the criterion for providing comprehensive context and clarity without the full paper. The reference to discussions "below" suggests it relies on further text not provided, which violates the requirement for self-contained information. Additionally, the presence of in-text citations disrupts the flow and could confuse readers unfamiliar with academic referencing styles, although this point does not directly violate the listed criteria.

LLM judge: NO

The content is a direct repetition of the same paragraph, thus violating the criteria for coherence and logical connection in a multi-paragraph text. Additionally, it does not present a progressive argument or additional information in subsequent paragraphs, which compromises its self-contained nature and its ability to offer comprehensive context.

## (s54) Topics discussed

(p54.0) Several topics are discussed in corporate governance and organisational performance. These range from internal corporate governance, which includes board activities, number of board members, gender diversity, racial diversity, CEO duality, board meetings, board committees, board compensation, board qualifications, board experience, board independence, and board leadership (Abdullah, 2004 Sengupta, Ruj, & Bit, 2020), however, beneficiaries are those that enjoy early adoption.

LLM judge: NO

The analysis reveals that the provided content repetitiously presents identical paragraphs, violating the requirement for cohesion and logical progression between multiple paragraphs if present. This repetition suggests a potential extraction or formatting error that impacts the integrity and coherence of the content, thereby undermining its suitability for integration into a question-answering dataset. Moreover, while the content is relatively comprehensive and contextually rich, its duplication indicates a failure in ensuring a logically structured and diverse discussion within the body of text provided.
