(p3.0) Gemcitabine monotherapy has been used for several years in locally advanced and metastatic BTC until the publication of the ABC-02 phase III trial in 2010. This trial has shown that gemcitabine plus cisplatin is associated with longer progression-free survival (median: 8.0 versus 5.0 months; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.77) and OS (median: 11.7 versus 8.7 months; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.80) compared to gemcitabine monotherapy. (Valle et al., 2010) Gemcitabine monotherapy was recently also evaluated in two phase II and one phase III trials in the adjuvant setting. It was initially hypothesized that the gemcitabine schedule as used in locally advanced and metastatic BTC may result in increased adverse events following hepatectomy, because gemcitabine is mainly metabolized in the liver. (Kainuma et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2011) For this purpose, one of the first randomized phase II studies in the adjuvant setting evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of two gemcitabine schedules in BTC patients after extensive surgical operations, such as major hepatectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy. (Kobayashi et al., 2011) A total of 27 patients with BTC were enrolled in this study and randomized between three-weekly gemcitabine for nine cycles and fourweekly gemcitabine for six cycles. The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate without any dose modification, which was 23% versus 14% (P = 0.81) in the three-weekly gemcitabine versus four-weekly gemcitabine arm, respectively. Neutropenia was the most All studies are RFS except otherwise indicated.

(p4.0) Two phase II trials have studied the efficacy and safety of adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin in BTC. The first study (NCT01073839) evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin in 30 patients with BTC. (Siebenhuner et al., 2018) A total of nine patients received gemcitabine every four weeks for six cycles and the remaining 21 patients received after a protocol amendment gemcitabine plus cisplatin every 3 weeks for a total eight cycles. The analysis of the primary endpoint (the frequency of adverse events) found the study treatment to be feasible with neutropenia (33% versus 57%), leucocytopenia (0% versus 38%), thrombocytopenia (11% versus 19%) and fatigue (33% versus 19%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients treated with gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin. After a median follow-up of 31.0 months, median DFS and OS in all patients were 14.9 and 40.6 months, respectively. In patients treated with gemcitabine monotherapy versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin, median DFS (14.4 versus 28.8 months, P = 0.22) and OS (46.9 versus 36.9 months, P = 0.67) were not statistically significantly different. Another single-arm phase II study (UMIN000001294) has assessed the feasibility and efficacy of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in 29 patients with BTC (n = 27) or ampullary carcinoma (n = 2). (Kainuma et al., 2015) Patients received gemcitabine and cisplatin every three weeks for a total of eight cycles. A total of 72% of these patients have completed the planned adjuvant treatment. The primary endpoint of this study was the feasibility and adverse events of this treatment. The study treatment was found feasible with neutropenia (27%), anemia (17%) and leucocytopenia (14%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events. After a median follow-up of 38.1 months, median OS was not reached and median RFS was 37.4 months. The four-year OS rate was 60%.

(p5.0) The PRODIGE 12/ACCORD 18 phase III trial randomized 196 patients with BTC to receive gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin for 12 cycles or surveillance. (Edeline et al., 2019) A minority of enrolled patients had pT3-4 tumors (35.6%), positive regional lymph nodes (36.6%) or microscopic positive resection margin (12.9%). After a median follow-up of 46.5 months, median RFS (the primary endpoint of the study) was 30.4 versus 18.5 months in the treatment versus observation arm (P = 0.47). Median OS was not significantly different between gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin and the observation arm (75.8 versus 50.8 months, P = 0.74). The treatment completion rate was 74%. In the subgroup analyses, no statistical difference in RFS or OS was observed between both arms when stratified by resection margin (R0 versus R1) or lymph node status (N0 versus N1 versus Nx). In the subgroup of patients with gallbladder cancer, patients treated with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin had shorter RFS (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.04-6.32) and OS (HR 3.39, 95% CI 1.17-9.83) compared to those in the observation arm. The treatment was found feasible with peripheral neuropathy (18.0%), and neutropenia (14.0%) as the most common grade 3 adverse events in the treatment arm in the first six months of the trial. Grade 4 adverse events were observed in 11% of the patients in the treatment arm including neutropenia (3%).

## (s7) Fluorouracil plus mitomycin C
Number of References: 9

(p7.0) In one of the early clinical adjuvant phase III trials in BTC 508 patients with BTC (n = 279), ampullary carcinoma (n = 56), or pancreatic cancer (n = 173) were randomized between adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C and observation following surgical resection. (Takada et al., 2002) Of note, this clinical trial included patients who had undergone curative resections, defined in this study as a microscopically radical resection (R0) of the primary tumor with removal of regional lymph node, as well as patients who had undergone surgical resections in the presence of peritoneal (4.3%), liver (5.7%), and other metastasis (0.9%). The majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma (86.4%) and gallbladder cancer (93.8%) had positive regional lymph nodes. In the subgroup of patients in whom a microscopically radical resection was achieved (n = 123), the five-year OS (primary endpoint of the study) in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (n = 72) treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C was not significantly different compared to those in the observation arm (41.0% versus 28.3%, P = 0.48). The five-year DFS rate was 32.4% and 15.8% in the treatment versus observation arm (P = 0.29). In patients with completely resected gallbladder cancer (n = 51), the five-year OS in patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C compared to observation was not statistically significant (46.4% versus 30.9%, P = 0.15). The difference in five-year DFS was not statistically significant between both arms (35.5% versus 25.0%, P = 0.12). In the subgroup analysis of all patients with gallbladder cancer, except those with liver and/or peritoneal metastasis, adjuvant chemotherapy was correlated with significantly longer RFS (HR 0.57, P = 0.05) and OS (HR 0.55, P = 0.03) in the multivariate analysis compared to observation. The completion rates of fluorouracil treatment were 79.3% and 94.2% in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, respectively. Patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C had higher rates of adverse events, including leucocytopenia (12.9%), anorexia (22.4%) and nausea/vomiting (12.9%, compared to observation).

## (s15) Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy
Number of References: 12

(p15.0) The feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was recently evaluated by two prospective studies. The first phase II study was initiated in 2003 and has enrolled patients with BTC (n = 12), ampullary carcinomas (n = 9), and pancreatic cancer (n = 29). (Cho et al., 2015) The majority of patients had pT3-4 tumors (61.9%) or positive regional lymph nodes (71.4%). Patients were treated with 2 cycles of gemcitabine plus docetaxel every three weeks before and after fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy (50.4-54.0 Gy). The addition of a taxane to gemcitabine was based on the promising results from phase II studies in locally advanced and metastatic BTC and pancreatic cancer. (Kuhn et al., 2002;Lutz et al., 2005) The primary endpoint of the study was the frequency of adverse events. The study treatment was found feasible with neutropenia (23%), diarrhea (15%), and infection (15%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events. After a mean followup of 24 months, median DFS and OS in the 12 patients with BTC were 16.3 months (95% CI 5.8-57.1) and 27.6 months (95% CI 9.5-57.1), respectively.

(p15.1) The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG S0809) is a phase II study that included 79 patients with perihilar or distal cholangiocarcinoma (n = 54) or gallbladder cancer (n = 25) with positive lymph nodes, positive resection margin or pT2-4 after a complete resection. (Ben-Josef et al., 2015) A minority of patients had a microscopic positive resection margin (31.6%), and the proportion of patients with pT3-4 tumors or positive regional lymph nodes was not reported. These patients were treated with four cycles of gemcitabine plus capecitabine every three weeks followed by capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy (54.0-59.4 Gy). Approximately 86% of patients completed the planned treatment. The two-year DFS and OS rates were 52% (95% CI 40%-62%) and 65% (95% CI 53%-74%), respectively. The DFS and OS were not significantly different between patients with R0 and R1 resection margins. About 52% and 11% of patients had grade 3 or 4 adverse events, respectively. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (44%) and hand-foot syndrome (11%).
## (s17) Combined neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy
Number of References: 6

(p17.0) Some retrospective studies have suggested a possible increase in complete resection rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in BTC. (Benjamin et al., 2017;Kobayashi et al., 2016) Recently, two randomized phase III trials were initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of perioperative chemotherapy. The phase III GAIN trial (NCT03673072) was initiated in Germany and plans to randomize 300 patients between neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by resection of cholangiocarcinoma or re-resection of incidental gallbladder cancer and adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin, or (re-)resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy based on the investigator's choice. Patients will receive gemcitabine plus cisplatin every three weeks. In case of incidental gallbladder cancer, patients are only eligible if they have a pT2-3 tumor. The primary endpoint is OS and the estimated date of completion of accrual is November 2024.
## (s18) Recommendations from international guidelines
Number of References: 27

(p18.0) The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2019) clinical practice guideline recommends adjuvant capecitabine for a duration of six months based on the results of the BILCAP trial. (Shroff et al., 2019) This guideline suggests also that patients with perihilar, distal cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder cancer and positive surgical resection margin may be candidates for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

(p18.1) In the European Association for Medical Oncology (ESMO, 2016) guideline and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline (version 3.0, 2019) for BTC, the results of the BILCAP trial were not yet adopted. The ESMO guideline does not recommend adjuvant therapy due to the absence of positive results from randomized phase III trials. (Valle et al., 2016) The ESMO guideline indicates that patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials and that outside the scope of clinical trials a multidisciplinary team may choose to offer adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone) to patients based on the best available evidence and only after considering the adverse events against the expected benefit from this treatment. (Valle et al., 2016) The NCCN guideline (version 3.0, august 2019) suggest various adjuvant treatment options mainly based on data from phase II trials.(National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), 2019) The NCCN guideline does not define a standard regimen or the definitive benefit from each suggested treatment because of limited available data. Possible adjuvant treatment options in patients with a negative microscopic resection margin and tumor-positive regional lymph nodes include: observation, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, or fluoropyrimidine-based chemo(radio) therapy. In case of positive microscopic resection margin or tumor involvement of regional lymph nodes, adjuvant therapy options include among others: gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or fluoropyrimidine chemo(radio)therapy. Participation in clinical trials is recommend for all patients regardless of the status of resection margin and regional lymph nodes.

(Valle et al., 2016) The ESMO guideline indicates that patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials and that outside the scope of clinical trials a multidisciplinary team may choose to offer adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone) to patients based on the best available evidence and only after considering the adverse events against the expected benefit from this treatment.

Possible adjuvant treatment options in patients with a negative microscopic resection margin and tumor-positive regional lymph nodes include: observation, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, or fluoropyrimidine-based chemo(radio) therapy. In case of positive microscopic resection margin or tumor involvement of regional lymph nodes, adjuvant therapy options include among others: gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or fluoropyrimidine chemo(radio)therapy. Participation in clinical trials is recommend for all patients regardless of the status of resection margin and regional lymph nodes.

(p18.4) The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2019) clinical practice guideline recommends adjuvant capecitabine for a duration of six months based on the results of the BILCAP trial. (Shroff et al., 2019) This guideline suggests also that patients with perihilar, distal cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder cancer and positive surgical resection margin may be candidates for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

(p28.0) Gemcitabine monotherapy has been used for several years in locally advanced and metastatic BTC until the publication of the ABC-02 phase III trial in 2010. This trial has shown that gemcitabine plus cisplatin is associated with longer progression-free survival (median: 8.0 versus 5.0 months; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.77) and OS (median: 11.7 versus 8.7 months; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.80) compared to gemcitabine monotherapy. (Valle et al., 2010) Gemcitabine monotherapy was recently also evaluated in two phase II and one phase III trials in the adjuvant setting. It was initially hypothesized that the gemcitabine schedule as used in locally advanced and metastatic BTC may result in increased adverse events following hepatectomy, because gemcitabine is mainly metabolized in the liver. (Kainuma et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2011) For this purpose, one of the first randomized phase II studies in the adjuvant setting evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of two gemcitabine schedules in BTC patients after extensive surgical operations, such as major hepatectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy. (Kobayashi et al., 2011) A total of 27 patients with BTC were enrolled in this study and randomized between three-weekly gemcitabine for nine cycles and fourweekly gemcitabine for six cycles. The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate without any dose modification, which was 23% versus 14% (P = 0.81) in the three-weekly gemcitabine versus four-weekly gemcitabine arm, respectively. Neutropenia was the most All studies are RFS except otherwise indicated.

(p29.0) Two phase II trials have studied the efficacy and safety of adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin in BTC. The first study (NCT01073839) evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin in 30 patients with BTC. (Siebenhuner et al., 2018) A total of nine patients received gemcitabine every four weeks for six cycles and the remaining 21 patients received after a protocol amendment gemcitabine plus cisplatin every 3 weeks for a total eight cycles. The analysis of the primary endpoint (the frequency of adverse events) found the study treatment to be feasible with neutropenia (33% versus 57%), leucocytopenia (0% versus 38%), thrombocytopenia (11% versus 19%) and fatigue (33% versus 19%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients treated with gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin. After a median follow-up of 31.0 months, median DFS and OS in all patients were 14.9 and 40.6 months, respectively. In patients treated with gemcitabine monotherapy versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin, median DFS (14.4 versus 28.8 months, P = 0.22) and OS (46.9 versus 36.9 months, P = 0.67) were not statistically significantly different. Another single-arm phase II study (UMIN000001294) has assessed the feasibility and efficacy of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in 29 patients with BTC (n = 27) or ampullary carcinoma (n = 2). (Kainuma et al., 2015) Patients received gemcitabine and cisplatin every three weeks for a total of eight cycles. A total of 72% of these patients have completed the planned adjuvant treatment. The primary endpoint of this study was the feasibility and adverse events of this treatment. The study treatment was found feasible with neutropenia (27%), anemia (17%) and leucocytopenia (14%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events. After a median follow-up of 38.1 months, median OS was not reached and median RFS was 37.4 months. The four-year OS rate was 60%.

(p30.0) The PRODIGE 12/ACCORD 18 phase III trial randomized 196 patients with BTC to receive gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin for 12 cycles or surveillance. (Edeline et al., 2019) A minority of enrolled patients had pT3-4 tumors (35.6%), positive regional lymph nodes (36.6%) or microscopic positive resection margin (12.9%). After a median follow-up of 46.5 months, median RFS (the primary endpoint of the study) was 30.4 versus 18.5 months in the treatment versus observation arm (P = 0.47). Median OS was not significantly different between gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin and the observation arm (75.8 versus 50.8 months, P = 0.74). The treatment completion rate was 74%. In the subgroup analyses, no statistical difference in RFS or OS was observed between both arms when stratified by resection margin (R0 versus R1) or lymph node status (N0 versus N1 versus Nx). In the subgroup of patients with gallbladder cancer, patients treated with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin had shorter RFS (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.04-6.32) and OS (HR 3.39, 95% CI 1.17-9.83) compared to those in the observation arm. The treatment was found feasible with peripheral neuropathy (18.0%), and neutropenia (14.0%) as the most common grade 3 adverse events in the treatment arm in the first six months of the trial. Grade 4 adverse events were observed in 11% of the patients in the treatment arm including neutropenia (3%).

(p32.0) In one of the early clinical adjuvant phase III trials in BTC 508 patients with BTC (n = 279), ampullary carcinoma (n = 56), or pancreatic cancer (n = 173) were randomized between adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C and observation following surgical resection. (Takada et al., 2002) Of note, this clinical trial included patients who had undergone curative resections, defined in this study as a microscopically radical resection (R0) of the primary tumor with removal of regional lymph node, as well as patients who had undergone surgical resections in the presence of peritoneal (4.3%), liver (5.7%), and other metastasis (0.9%). The majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma (86.4%) and gallbladder cancer (93.8%) had positive regional lymph nodes. In the subgroup of patients in whom a microscopically radical resection was achieved (n = 123), the five-year OS (primary endpoint of the study) in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (n = 72) treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C was not significantly different compared to those in the observation arm (41.0% versus 28.3%, P = 0.48). The five-year DFS rate was 32.4% and 15.8% in the treatment versus observation arm (P = 0.29). In patients with completely resected gallbladder cancer (n = 51), the five-year OS in patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C compared to observation was not statistically significant (46.4% versus 30.9%, P = 0.15). The difference in five-year DFS was not statistically significant between both arms (35.5% versus 25.0%, P = 0.12). In the subgroup analysis of all patients with gallbladder cancer, except those with liver and/or peritoneal metastasis, adjuvant chemotherapy was correlated with significantly longer RFS (HR 0.57, P = 0.05) and OS (HR 0.55, P = 0.03) in the multivariate analysis compared to observation. The completion rates of fluorouracil treatment were 79.3% and 94.2% in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, respectively. Patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C had higher rates of adverse events, including leucocytopenia (12.9%), anorexia (22.4%) and nausea/vomiting (12.9%, compared to observation).

(p40.0) The feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was recently evaluated by two prospective studies. The first phase II study was initiated in 2003 and has enrolled patients with BTC (n = 12), ampullary carcinomas (n = 9), and pancreatic cancer (n = 29). (Cho et al., 2015) The majority of patients had pT3-4 tumors (61.9%) or positive regional lymph nodes (71.4%). Patients were treated with 2 cycles of gemcitabine plus docetaxel every three weeks before and after fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy (50.4-54.0 Gy). The addition of a taxane to gemcitabine was based on the promising results from phase II studies in locally advanced and metastatic BTC and pancreatic cancer. (Kuhn et al., 2002;Lutz et al., 2005) The primary endpoint of the study was the frequency of adverse events. The study treatment was found feasible with neutropenia (23%), diarrhea (15%), and infection (15%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events. After a mean followup of 24 months, median DFS and OS in the 12 patients with BTC were 16.3 months (95% CI 5.8-57.1) and 27.6 months (95% CI 9.5-57.1), respectively.

(p40.1) The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG S0809) is a phase II study that included 79 patients with perihilar or distal cholangiocarcinoma (n = 54) or gallbladder cancer (n = 25) with positive lymph nodes, positive resection margin or pT2-4 after a complete resection. (Ben-Josef et al., 2015) A minority of patients had a microscopic positive resection margin (31.6%), and the proportion of patients with pT3-4 tumors or positive regional lymph nodes was not reported. These patients were treated with four cycles of gemcitabine plus capecitabine every three weeks followed by capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy (54.0-59.4 Gy). Approximately 86% of patients completed the planned treatment. The two-year DFS and OS rates were 52% (95% CI 40%-62%) and 65% (95% CI 53%-74%), respectively. The DFS and OS were not significantly different between patients with R0 and R1 resection margins. About 52% and 11% of patients had grade 3 or 4 adverse events, respectively. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (44%) and hand-foot syndrome (11%).

Number of References: 6

(p42.0) Some retrospective studies have suggested a possible increase in complete resection rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in BTC. (Benjamin et al., 2017;Kobayashi et al., 2016) Recently, two randomized phase III trials were initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of perioperative chemotherapy. The phase III GAIN trial (NCT03673072) was initiated in Germany and plans to randomize 300 patients between neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by resection of cholangiocarcinoma or re-resection of incidental gallbladder cancer and adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin, or (re-)resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy based on the investigator's choice. Patients will receive gemcitabine plus cisplatin every three weeks. In case of incidental gallbladder cancer, patients are only eligible if they have a pT2-3 tumor. The primary endpoint is OS and the estimated date of completion of accrual is November 2024.

(p43.0) The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2019) clinical practice guideline recommends adjuvant capecitabine for a duration of six months based on the results of the BILCAP trial. (Shroff et al., 2019) This guideline suggests also that patients with perihilar, distal cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder cancer and positive surgical resection margin may be candidates for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

(p43.1) In the European Association for Medical Oncology (ESMO, 2016) guideline and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline (version 3.0, 2019) for BTC, the results of the BILCAP trial were not yet adopted. The ESMO guideline does not recommend adjuvant therapy due to the absence of positive results from randomized phase III trials. (Valle et al., 2016) The ESMO guideline indicates that patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials and that outside the scope of clinical trials a multidisciplinary team may choose to offer adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone) to patients based on the best available evidence and only after considering the adverse events against the expected benefit from this treatment. (Valle et al., 2016) The NCCN guideline (version 3.0, august 2019) suggest various adjuvant treatment options mainly based on data from phase II trials.(National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), 2019) The NCCN guideline does not define a standard regimen or the definitive benefit from each suggested treatment because of limited available data. Possible adjuvant treatment options in patients with a negative microscopic resection margin and tumor-positive regional lymph nodes include: observation, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, or fluoropyrimidine-based chemo(radio) therapy. In case of positive microscopic resection margin or tumor involvement of regional lymph nodes, adjuvant therapy options include among others: gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or fluoropyrimidine chemo(radio)therapy. Participation in clinical trials is recommend for all patients regardless of the status of resection margin and regional lymph nodes.

## (s53) Gemcitabine
Number of References: 12

(p53.0) Gemcitabine monotherapy has been used for several years in locally advanced and metastatic BTC until the publication of the ABC-02 phase III trial in 2010. This trial has shown that gemcitabine plus cisplatin is associated with longer progression-free survival (median: 8.0 versus 5.0 months; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.77) and OS (median: 11.7 versus 8.7 months; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.80) compared to gemcitabine monotherapy. (Valle et al., 2010) Gemcitabine monotherapy was recently also evaluated in two phase II and one phase III trials in the adjuvant setting. It was initially hypothesized that the gemcitabine schedule as used in locally advanced and metastatic BTC may result in increased adverse events following hepatectomy, because gemcitabine is mainly metabolized in the liver. (Kainuma et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2011) For this purpose, one of the first randomized phase II studies in the adjuvant setting evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of two gemcitabine schedules in BTC patients after extensive surgical operations, such as major hepatectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy. (Kobayashi et al., 2011) A total of 27 patients with BTC were enrolled in this study and randomized between three-weekly gemcitabine for nine cycles and fourweekly gemcitabine for six cycles. The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate without any dose modification, which was 23% versus 14% (P = 0.81) in the three-weekly gemcitabine versus four-weekly gemcitabine arm, respectively. Neutropenia was the most All studies are RFS except otherwise indicated.

(p54.0) Two phase II trials have studied the efficacy and safety of adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin in BTC. The first study (NCT01073839) evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin in 30 patients with BTC. (Siebenhuner et al., 2018) A total of nine patients received gemcitabine every four weeks for six cycles and the remaining 21 patients received after a protocol amendment gemcitabine plus cisplatin every 3 weeks for a total eight cycles. The analysis of the primary endpoint (the frequency of adverse events) found the study treatment to be feasible with neutropenia (33% versus 57%), leucocytopenia (0% versus 38%), thrombocytopenia (11% versus 19%) and fatigue (33% versus 19%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients treated with gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin. After a median follow-up of 31.0 months, median DFS and OS in all patients were 14.9 and 40.6 months, respectively. In patients treated with gemcitabine monotherapy versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin, median DFS (14.4 versus 28.8 months, P = 0.22) and OS (46.9 versus 36.9 months, P = 0.67) were not statistically significantly different. Another single-arm phase II study (UMIN000001294) has assessed the feasibility and efficacy of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in 29 patients with BTC (n = 27) or ampullary carcinoma (n = 2). (Kainuma et al., 2015) Patients received gemcitabine and cisplatin every three weeks for a total of eight cycles. A total of 72% of these patients have completed the planned adjuvant treatment. The primary endpoint of this study was the feasibility and adverse events of this treatment. The study treatment was found feasible with neutropenia (27%), anemia (17%) and leucocytopenia (14%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events. After a median follow-up of 38.1 months, median OS was not reached and median RFS was 37.4 months. The four-year OS rate was 60%.

(p55.0) The PRODIGE 12/ACCORD 18 phase III trial randomized 196 patients with BTC to receive gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin for 12 cycles or surveillance. (Edeline et al., 2019) A minority of enrolled patients had pT3-4 tumors (35.6%), positive regional lymph nodes (36.6%) or microscopic positive resection margin (12.9%). After a median follow-up of 46.5 months, median RFS (the primary endpoint of the study) was 30.4 versus 18.5 months in the treatment versus observation arm (P = 0.47). Median OS was not significantly different between gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin and the observation arm (75.8 versus 50.8 months, P = 0.74). The treatment completion rate was 74%. In the subgroup analyses, no statistical difference in RFS or OS was observed between both arms when stratified by resection margin (R0 versus R1) or lymph node status (N0 versus N1 versus Nx). In the subgroup of patients with gallbladder cancer, patients treated with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin had shorter RFS (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.04-6.32) and OS (HR 3.39, 95% CI 1.17-9.83) compared to those in the observation arm. The treatment was found feasible with peripheral neuropathy (18.0%), and neutropenia (14.0%) as the most common grade 3 adverse events in the treatment arm in the first six months of the trial. Grade 4 adverse events were observed in 11% of the patients in the treatment arm including neutropenia (3%).

## (s57) Fluorouracil plus mitomycin C
Number of References: 9

(p57.0) In one of the early clinical adjuvant phase III trials in BTC 508 patients with BTC (n = 279), ampullary carcinoma (n = 56), or pancreatic cancer (n = 173) were randomized between adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C and observation following surgical resection. (Takada et al., 2002) Of note, this clinical trial included patients who had undergone curative resections, defined in this study as a microscopically radical resection (R0) of the primary tumor with removal of regional lymph node, as well as patients who had undergone surgical resections in the presence of peritoneal (4.3%), liver (5.7%), and other metastasis (0.9%). The majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma (86.4%) and gallbladder cancer (93.8%) had positive regional lymph nodes. In the subgroup of patients in whom a microscopically radical resection was achieved (n = 123), the five-year OS (primary endpoint of the study) in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (n = 72) treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C was not significantly different compared to those in the observation arm (41.0% versus 28.3%, P = 0.48). The five-year DFS rate was 32.4% and 15.8% in the treatment versus observation arm (P = 0.29). In patients with completely resected gallbladder cancer (n = 51), the five-year OS in patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C compared to observation was not statistically significant (46.4% versus 30.9%, P = 0.15). The difference in five-year DFS was not statistically significant between both arms (35.5% versus 25.0%, P = 0.12). In the subgroup analysis of all patients with gallbladder cancer, except those with liver and/or peritoneal metastasis, adjuvant chemotherapy was correlated with significantly longer RFS (HR 0.57, P = 0.05) and OS (HR 0.55, P = 0.03) in the multivariate analysis compared to observation. The completion rates of fluorouracil treatment were 79.3% and 94.2% in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, respectively. Patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C had higher rates of adverse events, including leucocytopenia (12.9%), anorexia (22.4%) and nausea/vomiting (12.9%, compared to observation).

(Stein et al., 2015) After the presentation of the BILCAP trial results in 2017 at the ASCO meeting, the protocol has been amended to compare gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus capecitabine every three weeksinstead of observation. Patients stratification is based on lymph node status (N0 versus N1) and the localization of the tumor. A total of 781 patients will be included from various centers in Europe and Australia. The primary endpoint is RFS and the secondary endpoints are OS, adverse events, and quality of life.

## (s65) Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy
Number of References: 12

(p65.0) The feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was recently evaluated by two prospective studies. The first phase II study was initiated in 2003 and has enrolled patients with BTC (n = 12), ampullary carcinomas (n = 9), and pancreatic cancer (n = 29). (Cho et al., 2015) The majority of patients had pT3-4 tumors (61.9%) or positive regional lymph nodes (71.4%). Patients were treated with 2 cycles of gemcitabine plus docetaxel every three weeks before and after fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy (50.4-54.0 Gy). The addition of a taxane to gemcitabine was based on the promising results from phase II studies in locally advanced and metastatic BTC and pancreatic cancer. (Kuhn et al., 2002;Lutz et al., 2005) The primary endpoint of the study was the frequency of adverse events. The study treatment was found feasible with neutropenia (23%), diarrhea (15%), and infection (15%) as the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events. After a mean followup of 24 months, median DFS and OS in the 12 patients with BTC were 16.3 months (95% CI 5.8-57.1) and 27.6 months (95% CI 9.5-57.1), respectively.

(p65.1) The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG S0809) is a phase II study that included 79 patients with perihilar or distal cholangiocarcinoma (n = 54) or gallbladder cancer (n = 25) with positive lymph nodes, positive resection margin or pT2-4 after a complete resection. (Ben-Josef et al., 2015) A minority of patients had a microscopic positive resection margin (31.6%), and the proportion of patients with pT3-4 tumors or positive regional lymph nodes was not reported. These patients were treated with four cycles of gemcitabine plus capecitabine every three weeks followed by capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy (54.0-59.4 Gy). Approximately 86% of patients completed the planned treatment. The two-year DFS and OS rates were 52% (95% CI 40%-62%) and 65% (95% CI 53%-74%), respectively. The DFS and OS were not significantly different between patients with R0 and R1 resection margins. About 52% and 11% of patients had grade 3 or 4 adverse events, respectively. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (44%) and hand-foot syndrome (11%).

(p67.0) Some retrospective studies have suggested a possible increase in complete resection rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in BTC. (Benjamin et al., 2017;Kobayashi et al., 2016) Recently, two randomized phase III trials were initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of perioperative chemotherapy. The phase III GAIN trial (NCT03673072) was initiated in Germany and plans to randomize 300 patients between neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by resection of cholangiocarcinoma or re-resection of incidental gallbladder cancer and adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin, or (re-)resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy based on the investigator's choice. Patients will receive gemcitabine plus cisplatin every three weeks. In case of incidental gallbladder cancer, patients are only eligible if they have a pT2-3 tumor. The primary endpoint is OS and the estimated date of completion of accrual is November 2024.

(p68.0) The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2019) clinical practice guideline recommends adjuvant capecitabine for a duration of six months based on the results of the BILCAP trial. (Shroff et al., 2019) This guideline suggests also that patients with perihilar, distal cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder cancer and positive surgical resection margin may be candidates for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

(p68.1) In the European Association for Medical Oncology (ESMO, 2016) guideline and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline (version 3.0, 2019) for BTC, the results of the BILCAP trial were not yet adopted. The ESMO guideline does not recommend adjuvant therapy due to the absence of positive results from randomized phase III trials. (Valle et al., 2016) The ESMO guideline indicates that patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials and that outside the scope of clinical trials a multidisciplinary team may choose to offer adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone) to patients based on the best available evidence and only after considering the adverse events against the expected benefit from this treatment. (Valle et al., 2016) The NCCN guideline (version 3.0, august 2019) suggest various adjuvant treatment options mainly based on data from phase II trials.(National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), 2019) The NCCN guideline does not define a standard regimen or the definitive benefit from each suggested treatment because of limited available data. Possible adjuvant treatment options in patients with a negative microscopic resection margin and tumor-positive regional lymph nodes include: observation, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, or fluoropyrimidine-based chemo(radio) therapy. In case of positive microscopic resection margin or tumor involvement of regional lymph nodes, adjuvant therapy options include among others: gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or fluoropyrimidine chemo(radio)therapy. Participation in clinical trials is recommend for all patients regardless of the status of resection margin and regional lymph nodes.
