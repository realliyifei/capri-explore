(p6.0) The Iraqi BW program was launched, in the early 1980s, by Saddam Hussein. Throughout the Gulf War, the Iraqi Biological Research Centre for Military defense, located at Salman Pak, studied the use of several bacteria (e.g., B. anthracis, B. melitensis, C. botulinum, and C. perfringens), toxins (e.g., aflatoxin, trichothecene), and viruses (e.g., camelpox virus, influenza virus, rotavirus, and West Nile virus) as bioweapons. This research culminated in the mass production of bioweapons either loaded into munitions (200 bombs and 25 ballistic missiles) or stored in spray tanks for later dissemination as aerosols. As a result, both troops on the battlefield and civilian populations in the region of conflict were threatened by the possible use of these weapons [35,36].

(p6.1) The United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), mandated to eliminate and prevent the revitalization of the Iraqi BW program, was expelled from Iraq, after seven years of work. As a consequence, Operation Desert Fox began. During its duration, the United States and Great Britain bombarded and destroyed three locations associated with the BW program [35,36].
