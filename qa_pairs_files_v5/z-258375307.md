(p9.0) TiO 2 is an insoluble compound, stable at high temperatures, cataloged with low toxicity, and inert at a physiological level (Iavicoli et al. 2011). However, in 2006, IARC (Shi et al. 2013) classified it as possibly carcinogenic in humans (Group 2B) because it has been observed to induce different toxicological effects in several organs and tissues. In the nervous system, it also can induce reactive oxygen species as well as inflammation and apoptosis in mice Shin et al. 2010); the internalization of the particles in the cell facilitates all of this. However, Rossi et al. (2010) mentioned that the evaluation of health risks cannot be solely based on pure nanoparticles; it is essential to consider modifying the nanoparticle's characteristics.
