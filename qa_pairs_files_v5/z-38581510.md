(p8.0) Three studies reported the impact of the intervention on actual database usage. One study logged clickthroughs from the electronic medical record system to determine how often students were accessing electronic resources to make evidence-based notes in the patient chart [27]. The use of electronic resources increased significantly, from an average of 0.12 clickthroughs per week to 0.66 click-throughs per week. Also, prior to the intervention, only 13% of the clickthroughs were to critically appraised resources. Following the intervention the percentage increased to 59%. In another study, Ovid search logs were examined to determine how many searches were conducted by students in intervention and control groups over the course of a 6-week clerkship [23]. Logs revealed that students participating in an online EBM course conducted an average of 12.4 MEDLINE and 1.6 Cochrane searches during the clerkship, compared to 2.6 MEDLINE and 0.2 Cochrane searches in the control group. The differences in searching rates of both databases were statistically significant.
