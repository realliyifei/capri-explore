## (s3) Alkaline Materials Used in REPs
Number of References: 8

(p3.0) A recent systematic review of the clinical protocols applied in REPs identified several alkaline materials used [18]. Sodium hypochlorite was employed as an irrigant in 97% of clinical studies. Calcium hydroxide was used in 28% of cases as intracanal medicament as an intracanal barrier, and mineral trioxide aggregate was used in 85% of clinical studies employing REPs [18]. The most recent study also identified other bioactive endodontic cements used [19]. Three studies used Biodentine [20][21][22], one used calcium-enriched material (CEM; BioniqueDent, Tehran, Iran) [23], and another used either MTA (Dentsply, York, PA, USA) or EndoSequence Bioceramic putty (Brasseler, Savannah, GA, USA) [24].
## (s6) Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA)

(p6.0) Major components of MTA powder are tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, bismuth oxide, calcium sulfate dehydrate or gypsum and tricalcium aluminate. For clinical applications, MTA is mixed with saline or distilled water [38]. This aqueous mixture results in the release of calcium hydroxide and subsequent calcium silicate hydrate formation, which eventuates into a poorly crystalized and porous solid gel [39]. The precipitated calcium produces calcium hydroxide that confers alkaline properties to MTA after hydration [40]. MTA is a bioactive material, as calcium hydroxide is, and associated calcium ions allow for cell attachment and proliferation [41,42]. The high pH confers antibacterial properties [43,44]. Hard tissue-producing cells differentiate and migrate onto the MTA surface, forming a biological seal [45][46][47].
## (s7) Biodentine

(p7.0) Biodentine is a bioceramic cement in the same family of compounds as MTA. The material is composed of tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, zirconium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium oxide and iron oxide. It is mixed with a hydrosoluble polymer and calcium chloride to decrease the setting time [38]. Biodentine is an alkaline cement with a pH range of 11.7-12.3 [60]. This material has also been shown not to be cytotoxic to pulp fibroblasts [61]. The dentine bridge formation formed by MTA and Biodentine was found to be comparable [62]. Biodentine can also be used as an intracanal barrier over the blood clot [20,63] and has been shown to stain teeth less than MTA [64][65][66]. Further studies on Biodentine effectiveness in REPs are needed prior to its recommendation for widespread use. It has been used in three studies that employed REPs [19].
