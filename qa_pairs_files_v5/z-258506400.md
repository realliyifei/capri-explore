## (s3) Immune (dys)regulation during sepsis: activation and suppression
Number of References: 16

(p3.0) Activation of the immune system by PAMPs and DAMPs aims to neutralise the pathogen yet excessive activation can result in tissue injury and can paradoxically render the host more vulnerable to subsequent infection, especially if the inflammatory state is both severe and prolonged [4,24,25].

(p3.1) As the pro-inflammatory response is mounted, the body simultaneously initiates a counterbalancing anti-inflammatory response, with the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist and IL-10 [26,27]. Combined with immune cell anergy and exhaustion, decreased chemotaxis, and increased apoptosis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and splenocytes [28], the net result is immunosuppression affecting both innate and adaptive immune systems and a failure to return to normal homeostasis. Consequently, the risk of secondary infection is enhanced by gut-derived Gram-negative organisms, opportunistic pathogens such as fungi, and reactivation of viruses such as cytomegalovirus that would rarely compromise a healthy host.

(p3.2) Anergy and exhaustion are produced by different mechanisms. Neutrophils show delayed apoptosis and a deficit in anti-microbial effector function, including oxidative burst capacity and chemotactic activity, while both neutrophils and PBMCs have a diminished cytokine and phagocytic response to ex vivo stimulation [29,30]. There is marked depletion of natural killer (NK) cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, and B-cells secondary to accelerated apoptosis [25,28], suppressed CD4 + T-helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 cell function [25], lower pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increased expression of checkpoint regulators such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). The density of cell surface receptors on circulating monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells such as HLA-DR that present peptide antigens to the immune system are depleted. Dendritic cells also show increased apoptosis and IL-10 production [31]. Expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells contributes to decreased monocyte function, while the proportion of circulating immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells (Treg) also increases [32,33]. In the adaptive immune system B-lymphocytes are also depleted with reduced production of immunoglobulins [28,34].
## (s6) Impact of hormonal changes on mitochondrial function
Number of References: 5

(p6.0) Glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones regulate metabolism through modifying mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Their receptors interact with mitochondrial and nuclear response elements affecting transcription factors and thus expression of nuclear-and mitochondrial-encoded genes [82]. These hormones also have rapid non-genomic effects on mitochondria involving cytoplasmic kinase signaling pathways [83]. These pathways result in alterations in the structure and function of key mitochondrial components including those of the electron transport chain ( Table  1).

(p6.1) The combination of early rises in cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon during sepsis in conjunction with an initial decrease in insulin rapidly impacts upon bioenergetics and metabolic activity. This initially includes increased oxygen and energy substrate availability as well as accelerated aerobic glycolysis to support increased tissue bioenergetic demands [70,84]. Insulin resistance and hyporesponsiveness to glucocorticoids during the prolonged phase of sepsis may, however, result in an inability to meet metabolic requirements. Although the classic thyroid hormones (T 4 and T 3 ) have been widely studied, little is known about the effects on mitochondria of rT 3 . In chickens rT 3 suppressed levels of free fatty acids in response to stressors [85]. The conversion switch from free T 3 to metabolically inactive or even suppressive rT 3 may serve as an adaptive coping mechanism to conserve energy.
## (s11) Mitochondrial biogenesis
Number of References: 14

(p11.0) Turnover of new mitochondria (biogenesis) is also influenced by hormonal changes. Low and/or short-term exposure to corticosteroids increased mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial DNA content [113]. Similar effects are reported with thyroid hormones, catecholamines, and insulin [87,92,110]. Corticosteroids and thyroid hormones have direct and indirect effects on co-activators and transcription factors of biogenesis, affecting nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded genes. Thyroid hormones also modulate chromatin structure of genes, thereby affecting gene expression. However, the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by thyroid hormones appears to be tissue-specific as no or opposing effects were observed in heart tissue [114]. Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors by adrenaline and noradrenaline promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and increased mitochondrial content non-genomically [115]. As with thyroid hormones, catecholamine-driven stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis via the transcription coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) also appears to be tissue specific [116]. The insulin-mediated increase in mitochondrial function, with mTOR and FOXO acting as downstream effectors, may be due to increased expression of electron transport chain complexes; insulin deficiency and resistance both decrease mitochondrial biogenesis [110]. The subsequent increase in mitochondrial mass may be responsible for elevations in resting metabolic rate [117].

(p11.1) By contrast, long-term or high dose exposure to corticosteroids results in abnormal regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, especially in skeletal muscle in vivo and in vitro [86]. In addition to its rapid-onset effects on mitochondria, T 3 is also a long-term regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α, increasing mitochondrial mass [118]. Lower circulating levels of this hormone during sepsis could act as a counterbalance. Long-term glucagon exposure also suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis via FOXO1 and regulation of sirtuins [107,119]. The effects of leptin on mitochondrial biogenesis are conflicting, but stimulation via PGC-1α may occur in brown adipose tissue [120].
## (s12) (Un)coupling and ROS
Number of References: 15

(p12.0) Glucocorticoids inhibited the activity of the uncoupling proteins UCP-1 and UCP-3 in brown adipose tissue [121] thereby increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, but up-regulated UCP-2 in microvascular endothelial cells [122]. No effects were seen in skeletal muscle [117]. Induction of uncoupling is regulated by both glucocorticoid-and mineralocorticoid receptors, to which these hormones bind with varying affinity. Although uncoupling increases oxygen consumption while decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and energy substrate availability, it could also be an adaptive mechanism to limit harmful production of mitochondrial ROS [122]. Chronic exposure to corticosteroids is, however, related to an increase in ROS production [86].

(p12.1) Despite increased respiration and ATP generation, T 3 reduces the efficiency of these processes while hypothyroid states reduce proton leak [89]. In brown adipose tissue, UCP-1 up-regulation appears responsible but lower basal proton leak in mitochondria from hypothyroid rats in other tissues is not yet fully understood. Possible mechanisms include induction of UCP-2 or UCP-3, or changes in phospholipid composition of the mitochondrial membrane [87]. Overall, thyroid hormones are associated with increased ROS production and potential damage due to augmented oxidative metabolism and decreased antioxidant protection; hypothyroid states on the other hand decrease ROS [123].

(p12.2) Catecholamines also increase ROS production and are associated with oxidative damage to liver [92,124], and skeletal muscle [115]. Surprisingly, the increase in ROS in skeletal muscle occurred in conjunction with a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. The respiratory control ratio (RCR) increased with noradrenaline and adrenaline use in endotoxaemic models [93,101], yet respiratory efficiency was impaired [125]. Although mitochondria are not the only source of ROS in phagocytic cells, noradrenaline reduced ROS production in stimulated primary monocytes as well as in endotoxin-stimulated neutrophils but suppressed the respiratory burst in non-LPS challenged neutrophils [97].
## (s14) Other mitochondrial changes

(p14.0) Other long-term glucocorticoid effects on mitochondria include structural abnormalities with mitochondrial damage due to induced hyperglycaemia [147]. Strict glycaemic control with insulin therapy prevented ultrastructural and functional abnormalities of liver mitochondria [131]. The increased cellular energy demands during stress with associated increases in mitochondrial ROS production can damage mitochondria when antioxidant defences are overwhelmed. Mitophagy is a quality control mechanism that can be induced by T 3 to limit ROS-induced damage [148]. Insulin deprivation increases markers of mitophagy [149]. In rats, isoprenaline, a synthetic catecholamine, promoted cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction by opening the mPTP and increasing mitochondrial membrane swelling, while noradrenaline protected skeletal muscle mitochondria from propofol-induced dysfunction [150]. This may be especially relevant to septic patients who are sedated. Mitochondria are protected by glucagon by changes in the disposition of the inner mitochondrial membrane [151]. Mice lacking both insulin and IGF-1 receptors showed morphological changes in cardiac tissue preceded by down-regulation of genes encoding for electron transport chain and fatty acid β-oxidation pathways within mitochondria and altered expression of contractile proteins [152].
## (s16) The innate immune system
Number of References: 5

(p16.0) Despite their generally anti-inflammatory effects, glucocorticoids appear to act in a biphasic manner. Low doses of endogenous glucocorticoids, or exposure to this hormone without an additional inflammatory stimulus, can enhance pathways involved in the innate immune response by up-regulating PRRs, cytokine receptors and complement factors. This includes aiding differentiation of macrophages, promoting phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and debris by monocytes and macrophages, and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion [155]. Expression of pro-and anti-inflammatory genes are regulated via NF-κB and AP-1 or by post-translational protein modification [155]. In contrast, glucocorticoids exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, impairing phagocytosis in macrophages, increasing apoptosis of neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils, and decreasing antigen presentation and co-stimulation by dendritic cells which will ultimately affect the adaptive immune system [155][156][157].
## (s17) The adaptive immune system
Number of References: 10

(p17.0) Glucocorticoids regulate adaptive immunity by inhibiting lymphocyte activation and promoting lymphocyte apoptosis, events also observed in sepsis [156,157]. At high concentrations, B-and T-cell production is also inhibited [157]. Glucocorticoids inhibit pro-inflammatory genes involved in adaptive immunity and also dampen signals downstream of PRRs, cytokine receptors and Fcε receptors. They inhibit expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules that curtail inflammation and reduce leukocyte recruitment [179][180][181][182], directly suppress CD4 + T-cell activation and favour differentiation of T-cells into Th2 and Treg cells over Th1 and Th17 cells.

(p17.1) Similar to the abovementioned anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, β 2 -adrenergic receptor activation by catecholamines also affects the adaptive immune response by suppressing T-cell proliferation and shifting differentiation of Th cells towards Th2 polarisation. This subsequently reduces the production of IFN-γ by Th1 cells and the ability to fight intracellular bacterial infections [158]. As with their effects on innate immune cells, α-adrenergic receptor activation increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while β 2 -adrenergic receptor activation favours production of anti-inflammatory cytokines [158]. Of note, elevated levels of catecholamines have been reported up to two years after critical illness [183]; this is associated with immunosuppressive effects that persist long after hospital admission and increase susceptibility to secondary infection and risk of hospital re-admission.
## (s18) Conclusion
Number of References: 4

(p18.0) Sepsis is a complicated syndrome with various interlinked bodily systems that are affected in a time-dependent manner, making it difficult to translate findings to a clinical setting. We do appreciate that the current review focuses on a simplified selection of stress and metabolic hormones, making that the overall picture is even more complicated. Despite this, it is evident that immune cell function depends on mitochondrial function, and that the hormones discussed affect both immune cell and mitochondrial function which could significantly contribute to mortality in sepsis [59,60,193]. Supplementing endogenous changes with exogenous administration of, e.g., insulin, catecholamines, and hydrocortisone [193] could therefore be detrimental for patients in the long run. However, other improved treatment strategies are currently lacking. Additionally, there is still some controversy to be found in the literature and limited knowledge on underlying mechanisms. Variations might be largely due to differences in study methodologies. This includes differences in tissues and cells studied, exposure duration and timing, septic source or stimulus, dose and formulation of hormones used. Further studies are required to fully elucidate how each of these hormones may affect the immune system and mitochondria, especially studies with clinically relevant concentrations in those cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, and more importantly how these hormones work in unison to mediate some of the commonly seen changes in sepsis.
