## (s0) INTRODUCTION
Number of References: 2

(p0.0) Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by predominant involvement of the spine and/or sacroiliac joints. It consists of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and undifferentiated type [1] . Axial (SpA) comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases which predominantly involve the axial skeleton and have many overlapping clinical features. The axial SpA spectrum ranges from non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA) at one end to AS at the other. Nr-axSpA comprises SpA patients without definite sacroiliitis on pelvic X-ray [2] . The most important clinical and laboratory features of this group are inflammatory back pain, enthesitis, dactylitis, extra-articular manifestations (acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease) and association with HLA-B27.
## (s7) Techniques used to detect BMD
Number of References: 24

(p7.0) We included studies which used DXA as the technique of BMD assessment in patients with axSpA. Eleven of the 55 studies were comparative studies in which DXA techniques were compared with QUS [7,13,14] , single energy QCT [8] , QCT [9,[15][16][17][18][19] , dual-energy QCT [20] , peripheral QCT [20] and HRpQCT [9] . Regarding the comparative studies, one study demonstrated that QUS correlated with DXA [13] but this result was not confirmed in any other study [7] . On the other hand, Jansen et al [14] demonstrated similar performance with QUS compared to DXA in detecting OP-associated fracture risk. Numerous QCT studies demonstrated higher prevalence of OP compared to those studies which used DXA as the assessment tool [8,9,18] , whereas only one study revealed no difference between QCT and DXA [20] . Two studies revealed a good correlation between QCT and DXA [9,15] , however lumbar spine DXA was shown to be less useful than QCT to detect the degree of osteopenia in late stage AS [15,17] . The change in bone formation and resorption markers including bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), osteocalcin (OC), C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type Ⅰ collagen (CTX), and deoxypyridinoline is presented in Table 4. There are conflicting results regarding the levels of bone formation and resorption markers in patients with AS and other forms of SpA.

(p9.0) Patients with active disease (BASDAI > 4) had significantly lower proximal femur BMD compared to patients with inactive disease, whereas spinal BMD was similar in the study by Kaya et al [31] . After 24-mo of follow-up lumbar spinal BMD increased in both groups; however hip BMD decreased in the inactive group [31] .

(p9.1) On the other hand, Gratacós et al [6] reported that BMD at the lumbar spine and at the femoral neck decreased in patients with active disease but no change was observed in patients with inactive disease after 19 mo of follow-up. There are conflicting results in followup studies. For examples, Maillefert et al [32] reported unchanged lumbar BMD but decreased femoral neck after 12 mo of follow-up, whereas Haugeberg et al [33] failed to demonstrate significant reduction in hip, spine or hand BMD. C-reactive proteine (CRP) levels have been suggested as an independent predictor of BMD change in patients with AS [6] . Additionally, femoral neck BMD has been found to be associated with persistent systemic inflammation which was defined by elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [32] .

## (s10) Change in bone mass after anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy
Number of References: 21

(p10.0) In all interventional studies BMD at the lumbar spine [34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41] increased in patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Additionally, hip BMD also increased [34][35][36][37][39][40][41] except for one study in which hip BMD remained unchanged [38] . Baseline bALP, OC and CTX levels significantly correlated with the increase in spinal BMD at weeks 24 and 102 after anti-TNF therapy [40] . Changes in acute phase reactants as well as disease activity scores have been demonstrated to correlate with the changes in BMD measurements [36,39,41] . Spinal BMD changes were shown to be associated with changes in ESR and newly formed syndesmophytes under anti-TNF therapy [36] .
## (s11) DISCUSSION
Number of References: 51

(p11.0) OP is a well-known problem in patients with AS which begins in the early stages of the disease and inevitably causes vertebral fractures [42][43][44] . The reported prevalence of OP in AS varies from 3% to 47% according to the measurement techniques and patient selection criteria used. Osteopenia has been reported in up to 88% of patients with SpA. An increased prevalence of spinal bone loss may occur even in early and mild forms of SpA [8,[42][43][44][45][46] . Systemic inflammation may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of OP in patients with systemic inflammatory disorders including SpA. This notion is supported with data from studies revealing reduced spinal BMD in patients with early or mild disease without advanced structural damage at the spine [20,21,30,43,47] . In advanced cases, spinal ossifications may mislead normal or artificially increased BMD at the lumbar spine. In such cases DXA measurements of the spine with lateral projections have been suggested to improve sensitivity [27,48] . On the other hand, the precision of DXA measurements on the lateral spine is reasonably lower than on the AP spine or proximal femur [27,48] .

(p11.1) As an alternative method QCT, which selectively measures trabecular and cortical bone density, can be used to determine spinal BMD in cases with advanced structural changes [8,9,19,20] . Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is known as the reference method to measure BMD. It is an accurate, reproducible, and non-invasive method with good short or long-term precision. Multiple skeletal sites can be safely and precisely assessed by DXA [49] .

(p11.2) Direct radiography is still a valid method for assessing structural damage in patients with axial SpA; however it gives little information about bone density since demineralization needs to reach 50% in order to confirm a reliable bone loss on radiographs. Higher incidence of bone loss at the hip compared to the lumbar spine has been suggested in various studies conducted in patients with AS [7,14,15,20,24,44,[46][47][48]50] . There are inconclusive results regarding the association between DXA measurements with clinical and laboratory findings. Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip has been shown to correlate with BASDAI [16,[24][25][26] , ESR [16,[24][25][26]28] and CRP [16,[24][25][26]28] . However conflicting results have also been reported [7,13,20,29] .
