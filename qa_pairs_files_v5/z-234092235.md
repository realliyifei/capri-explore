## (s11) Formulation of FOR Determination as Sequential Linear Constrained Quadratic Programming
Number of References: 3

(p11.0) Linear constrained linear programming is identified in Section 1.2 as one of the main optimization methods for the determination of the FOR. This approach achieves a fast solution by solving a linearized model of the power system under consideration of linear constraints. By approximating non-linear equations with a linear approach, inaccuracies result, which need to be taken into account, especially for a small apparent power flow within the system [38]. Considering these inaccuracies of linear constrained approaches the optimization problem is formulated as quadratically constrained linear program (see [38,39]). This optimization problem will be addressed sequentially to counteract remaining inaccuracies.
