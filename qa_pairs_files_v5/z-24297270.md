(p3.0) MR spectroscopy enables noninvasive monitoring of changes in metabolism from brain damage in a specified region. Although most previous studies regarding findings of MR spectroscopy in patients with CO poisoning were only case reports and differences existed in the regions used for placement of the voxel of interest in the brain, these reports have consistently shown increased levels of Cho indicating active membrane metabolism associated with pathologic conditions such as degeneration and gliosis, decreased NAA reflecting loss or degeneration of axons and/or neurons, and the presence of lactate representing anaerobic glycolysis under ischemic and/or hypoxic conditions. 56,61-67 These metabolites are usually evaluated by using the relative ratio to Cr as an indication of stored energy, which reportedly remains relatively stable even in the presence of rapid fluctuations in energy metabolism. When attention is focused on the period in which each metabolite appears, these studies reported that the Cho/Cr ratio increased earliest in metabolites and decreased in the late period of the chronic phase, the NAA/Cr ratio began to decrease at the earliest from 3 to 4 weeks, and lactate began to appear at the earliest from 1 to 2 months after CO poisoning in patients with chronic symptoms. 56,[61][62][63][64][65][66][67] It is noteworthy that declines in NAA levels have been proposed as a good prognostic factor, as the NAA/Cr ratio correlates with symptom development, and the presence of lactate acts as a marker of irreversible brain damage because it has been observed in patients with severe chronic symptoms such as akinetic mutism and apallic state. MR spectroscopy findings by 3T MR imaging in the subacute phase in 29 patients with CO poisoning found that the Cho/Cr ratio in the centrum semiovale was slightly but significantly higher in patients with subsequent chronic-phase symptoms than in patients with transient symptoms in the acute phase. 68 Increased Cho level in the subacute phase demonstrates inflammation accompanied with progressive demyelination in CWM and may enable prediction of the patient's condition in the chronic phase.
