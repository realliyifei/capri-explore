(p1.0) An important challenge for environmental policy makers is choosing a suitable mitigation strategy. Put simply, policy makers need to decide how much GHG emissions should be allowed to avoid the climate system to reach damaging temperature levels. Reducing GHG emissions is costly but helps to limit the damages of global temperature increases. The cumulative level of GHG emissions that an economy can reach over a given period (e.g., the twenty-first century) is called the "carbon budget". It is a variable that is supposed to be directly under the control of the policy maker and is strictly related to global warming and climate targets (Meinshausen et al. 2009;Drouet et al. 2015). So, this decision (or control) variable-an action in the decision theory terminology-represents a policy that the policy maker can perform.
