(p0.0) Salmonine fishes are experiencing many anthropogenic disturbances and may need to adapt if they are to persist. In their native range, for instance, many populations are extinct or threatened with extinction, typically due to human activities (e.g., Gustafson et al. 2007). Consequently, there is considerable interest in predicting whether and how populations (or more specifically, traits within populations) will evolve in response to these perturbations (e.g., Crozier et al. 2008). Understanding the adaptive potential of these fishes requires information on quantitative genetic parameters, which is the goal of this paper. Specifically, we reviewed estimates of two quantitative genetic parameters, heritability (h 2 ) and genetic correlation (r G ), for fitness traits for Pacific salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus spp.), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus), and the circumpolar charr (Salvelinus spp.).

## (s18) Environmental variation and heritability
Number of References: 5

(p18.0) Estimates of genetic parameters are influenced by the environment in which parents and offspring are reared. Heritability estimates as ratios of genotypic variance over phenotypic variance are directly affected by the influence of the environment on total phenotypic variance in a trait. Heritability and genetic correlation estimates may also be influenced by the quality of the environment (i.e., whether or not it is 'favorable' to the trait; Hoffman and Merilä 1999). For both parameters, the value (and in the case of correlations, the sign) of the estimate may change under the influence of varying environmental quality (Hoffman and Merilä 1999;Sgrò and Hoffman 2004). Moreover, the class of traits (e.g., life history, morphological) may not be equally affected (Charmantier and Garant 2005). This becomes important when evaluating the results of this review both because the majority of published estimates were generated from experiments conducted under farmed or hatchery conditions ('treatment', Fig. S1E) and because, contrary to a previously published review (Weigensberg and Roff 1996), we found direct effects of treatment and more complex effects of the source population on estimates of genetic parameters. Each of the potential treatment settings (hatchery, farmed, sea-ranched, wild) is associated with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages in terms of estimating quantitative genetic parameters and on the traits mea-sured themselves. For instance, highly controlled operations such as hatcheries or fish farms, allow maximum control over many aspects of the rearing conditions (e.g., temperature, density): a highly domesticated stock may find the hatchery conditions favorable, while a wild stock would find them stressful. Thus, the quantitative genetic parameters estimated may not have relevance for wild populations.

How do environmental qualities and rearing conditions affect the estimates of genetic parameters like heritability and genetic correlation?
