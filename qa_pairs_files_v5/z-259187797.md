(p0.0) The fast expansion of research articles hinders researchers from keeping track of the emerging findings in their areas of expertise [13]. While systematic literature reviews are labor-intensive, the median time for them to go outdated is 5.5 years [22]. Given the current pace of publishing, it is increasingly challenging to cover the escalating pool of articles and to monitor the latest developments in a particular field. Automated content analysis [18] and extractive text summarization systems [5] have been argued as key tools to support literature synthesis and to keep track of research trends.

(p0.1) Automated content analysis for literature reviews commonly aims to map text into topics using the articles' abstracts. [18] show how automated content analysis can synthesize big volumes of literature's abstracts from ecology and evolutionary biology. In the Climate Change domain, [7] use machine learning and experts evaluations to map key messages relevant to climate change mitigation using around 100,000 articles' abstracts related to demand-side mitigation. Regarding climate change adaptation, [14] use the abstracts and metadata from around 7000 articles to map the evolution of climate change adaptation science across time.
