(p12.0) Office blood pressure was measured in five studies [32,33,41,43,44] (Table 3).Argiana and colleagues [32] observed a tendency for decreasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both groups.In the study by Li et al. [43], systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure all increased (p < 0.05) in the control group, but the effect of the intervention was not significant (p > 0.05).On the contrary, Mateo-Gallego et al. [44] found a trend for decreased systolic blood pressure in controls (p < 0.05) compared with the intervention group (p > 0.05).Jenkins [41] and Pavithran et al. [33] did not find significant effects of their interventions on systolic or diastolic blood pressure.However, heart rate increased in the control group in the study by Jenkins et al. [41], with the effect of the control diet (high fiber) being significantly different from that of the low-GI diet.
