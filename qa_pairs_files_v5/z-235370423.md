(p0.0) The liver is critically important for the metabolism and excretion of many anticancer drugs 1,2 and liver disease and/ or liver impairment in patients with cancer can alter drug pharmacokinetics, necessitating dose modification. Depending on the drug administered, impairment may slow the breakdown of active or toxic metabolites (i.e. increasing drug toxicity) or the activation of prodrugs (i.e. decreasing drug effectiveness). 3 Additionally, varying etiologies of liver impairment, such as liver metastases, previous anticancer treatments, cirrhosis, or hepatitis, may differently impact the pharmacokinetics of drugs. 3,4 The narrow therapeutic index of many anticancer drugs, 5 the possible toxicities from incorrect dosing, and the potential loss of efficacy from underdosing, all demonstrate the importance of determining the correct starting dose of drugs in patients with cancer and liver impairment.
