## (s8) Sudden death
Number of References: 5

(p8.0) Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is an important clinical manifestation of ARVD. Although an uncommon cause of SCD, in the U.S., ARVD accounts for an estimated 5% of SCD in patients aged 65 years or below [30] and between 3% and 4% in exercise-related SCDs in young athletes [31]. In Veneto region Italy, ARVD is the most frequently encountered cause of death in clinical practice in individuals aged 35 years or below usually associated with intense exercise [6,32]. Estimated annual mortality rate of ARVD ranges from 1% with pharmacotherapy to 3% if left untreated. The suspected mechanism of ARVD-related SCD is acceleration of ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation or the degradation in functional and structural RV performance [29].
## (s9) Heart failure
Number of References: 6

(p9.0) Patients with ARVD may develop isolated right heart failure or biventricular heart failure, which usually manifest in the third and fourth decades of life [13]. ARVD is one of very few myocardial disorders in the absence of pulmonary hypertension that causes right heart failure. The mechanism of right ventricular failure is dilation, thinning of wall and continued loss of contractile function due to myocardial atrophy [29]. In ARVD, right heart failure manifests four to eight years after the occurrence of an ECG-indicated right bundle branch block (RBBB) [30]. Whereas left heart failure is uncommon in ARVD, the disorder can involve LV and induce mild changes in LV function. If ARVD causes heart failure, there is a likelihood of misdiagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy of idiopathic or viral origin [13]. In most cases, LV dysfunction in ARVD represents biventricular dysplasia, which should be distinguished from biventricular fibrotic myocarditis [33]. Distinction is important since ARVD patients a more likely to present with drug-resistance arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death and thus require other therapeutic options [29].
## (s20) Mechanism of genetic etiology

(p20.0) Inherited genetic mutation has been frequently cited as the dominant etiology of ARVD indicated in many studies that define ARVD as a heterogeneous hereditary myocardial disorder usually with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance [34,[44][45][46]. The suspected genetic etiopathogenesis of ARVD may be explained by a purely structural theory illustrated in Figure 4. Abnormalities in the myocardial cell-to-cell connection through contacts referred to as intercalated discs. Portion of the discs could also have abnormalities referred to as the desmosome. The desmosome disrupts the normal structure and function of desmosomal proteins leading to intercalated discs pulling apart [34,38]. Figure 3 illustrates mutations in various cardiac desmosomal genes with important roles in the etiopathogenesis of ARVD. The desmosomal cardiac genes play four important roles in the normal structure and function of myocardium. They support structural stability (cell-to-cell adhesion) (A), regulate transcription in genes involved in adipogenesis, apoptosis and in the maintenance of normal electrical conductivity (B), regulate gap junction (C) and regulation of calcium ion (Ca + ) in the extracellular fluid (D) [38]. The most affected myocardial cells are in the RV but as ARVD progress, RV becomes involved, and in rare cases, the LV might be an early or predominant site of ARVD [43]. The disruption of the normal structure of the myocardium may lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, RV dysfunction and sudden cardiac death [38].

(p20.1) Recent studies on electron microscopy have supported the purely structural theory postulating the loss of myocyte adhesion causes necrosis and fibrosis to explain genetic pathogenesis of ARVD [47,48]. The two studies report ultrastructural abnormalities of the desmosome (focal scar) linked with desmosomal gene mutations. Focal scar would lead to the characteristic ARVD-related RV arrhythmias with environmental factors such as intense exercise or inflammation cause by viral infection could stimulate the pulling apart of the desmosome and   [1] exacerbate disease progression [38]. The RV is at a higher risk of the loss of myocyte adhesion due to thinner wall and normal dilatory response to exercise. However, the structural theory fails to explain preserved LV myocardium and late onset of the disorder in some individuals having desmosomal gene mutation [38].
## (s25) Differential diagnosis Diagnosis criteria
Number of References: 6

(p25.0) Morphological and functional abnormalities of the RV myocardium in ARVD became apparent after the publication of the first clinical profile in 1982 based on 24 patient cases with advanced disease [6]. However, since then, ARVD has proved difficult to diagnose especially if the patient has mild or no discernible structural or functional changes to the RV myocardium. Bomma et al. [65] re-evaluated 65 patients diagnosed with ARVD based on MRI findings of intramyocardial fat or RV wall thinning from an outside institution and found none of the patients had ARVD, suggesting a high frequency of misdiagnosis especially diagnosis based purely on MRI wall thinning and fibrofatty replacement.

(p25.1) Diagnosis challenges and the lack of a gold standard or single test to diagnose ARVD informed the formation of the Task Force of the Working Group Myocardial and Pericardial Disease of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and of the Scientific Council on Cardiomyopathies of the International Society and Federation of Cardiology (ISFC). The ESC/ISFC Task Force developed the initial standardized guidelines for the diagnosis of ARVD in 1994 [66] and later revised them in 1996 [9]. Table 3 summarizes the revised Task Force criteria for the diagnosis of ARVD. The standardized criteria streamlines and simplifies diagnosis but uncertainty persists because of the lack of quantified guidelines in many criteria and the lack of reports on outcomes of evaluation of large series of newly diagnosed ARVD patients using task force criteria [67,68].
## (s30) Challenges of genetic testing
Number of References: 12

(p30.0) The complexity of genetic etiology of ARVD complicates the efficacy of genetic testing. Although the most common ARVD gene leading to clinical manifestation of ARVD is the plakophilin-2 gene,  many ARVD patients have compound heterozygosity (more than one mutation in the same gene) or digenic heterozygosity (more than one mutation in a complementary gene) [38]. The plakophilin-2 gene thus may require compound or digenic heterozygosity to manifest clinical symptoms of ARVD, which challenges the accurate determination of the causative gene defect by genetic testing [37]. Defective ARVD causative desmosomal gene has only been identified in 1 in 400 individuals yet in a Finish population-prevalence study for ARVD desmosomal mutation, 1 in 200 health individuals have desmosomal gene mutations for ARVD [73] and 6% of healthy individuals of Asian descent have an abnormal plakophilin-2 gene [50,74].

(p30.1) Genetic testing for ARVD also has challenges in result interpretation due to multiple reports of 48% of individuals diagnosed with familial ARVD having multiple mutations in the same gene [49,[75][76][77][78]. These individuals usually present with more severe signs and symptoms. Since not all ARVD-associated genes have not been identified, determination of the causative defective gene may be problematic. Family members with an unknown defective mutation in many cases may have genenegative findings. They should be considered for intermittent examinations to determine that they are not at-risk of ARVD [37]. Finally, the cost of genetic testing is high and prohibitive for many patients and/or families. An average cost of US$5,400 in the U.S. is high, which is exacerbated by some laboratories not accepting commercial insurance including Medicare or Medicaid [37].
## (s34) Cardiac MRI
Number of References: 6

(p34.0) Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important noninvasive imaging tool capable of characterizing tissue and distinguishing fat from muscle tissue. Fast spin or turbo spin echo are recommended for black blood imaging, which best assesses the RV free wall and outflow tract. Stack of axial images should image the entire RV by using 6-8 slices at 1 cm intervals [79]. Table 6 summarizes the recommended cardiac MRI protocol for ARVD The main challenge of cardiac MRI in imaging ARVD patients is the lack of well-defined sensitivity and specificity such that the quality of images is operator dependent and findings subject to individual interpretation (inter-observer variability) [20,79]. Marcus et al. [68] analyzed findings of American Multidisciplinary study on clinical presentation and diagnosis of ARVD and reports variation between MRI diagnosis of referral center and core laboratory. Core laboratory did not confirm 29% of diagnosis confirmed by the referral center [68]. Cine-MRI promises better detection by the ability to estimate RV volume and wall motion abnormalities due to akinesia, dyskinesia and aneurysms [1]. Figure 7 shows cardiac MRI four-chamber and short-axis imaging planes of ARVD patient with predominant RV abnormalities. The left panels show end-diastolic and right panel end-systolic. The arrow in the 4-chamber end-diastolic image shows subtricuspid dyskinesia while arrows in the short axis images show RV free wall aneurysm -systolic and diastolic bulging.

(p40.0) The findings reveal diagnosis of ARVD depends on a combination of methods assessing functional and structural alterations in the myocardium. The most common method was electrocardiography abnormalities adopted by 50% (half) of the studies, followed by cardiac MRI by 33.3% echocardiography by 16.7%, endomyocardial biopsy by 11% and finally cardiac computed tomography by 5.5%. the ECG method measured conduction (depolarization or repolarization) abnormalities such as Prolonged S-wave upstroke in V1-V3; Epsilon wave; prolonged QRS duration; T-wave inversion in V1-V3 [83], localized right precordial QRS prolongation (98%); Epsilon waves; T wave inversions [84], QRS fragmentation Epsilon potential [84,86]. Echocardiography assessed both functional and morphological myocardial alterations: RV diastolic dimension [6], RV dimensions and fractional area changes [89] and RV enlargement [90]. Cardiac MRI assessed morphological changes: myocardial fibrofatty changes [94,95], intramyocardial wall thinning [65] and RV enlargement/size and location of fibrofatty depositions [92]. Endomyocardial biopsy assessed fatty tissues but was more accurate for differential diagnosis to detect and exclude myocarditis, which mimics ARVD.
## (s43) Genetic counselling
Number of References: 2

(p43.0) Genetic counselling is considered for patients diagnosed or suspected to have familial (inherited) ARVD. A genetic counsellor should be trained in medical genetics and counselling to assist physicians and patients in the genetic testing process. Counselling usually involves a review of diagnosis, detailed family history and cost, and discussion of tests carried out. Genetic testing assists patients to understand the underlying reasons causing the disease, prognosis and any risk the condition poses to close family members [34]. Genetic testing informs the consideration of prevention of triggers such as intense exercise activities [1].

(p50.0) The seven studies on ICD therapy demonstrate ARVD patients have good toleration and the therapy provides long-term life-saving protection by preventing lethal ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation or flutter. Further, ICD with non-thoracotomy leads is safe and efficacious in ARVD patients by reducing cases of perforation [101]. Whereas radiofrequency ablation has favorable short-term outcomes by preventing ventricular tachycardia (VT), there is significance recurrence of VT in the longterm because of diffuse nature of ARVD and evolving electrical substrate [104][105][106]. Finally, pharmacotherapy involving β-blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs offer favorable prognosis in the short-term [107-109]. Amiodarone has been shown to have superior protective effect against VT compared to β-blockers and Sotalol [107]. β-blockers taken with amiodarone and programmed electrical stimulation offer better protection against VT [109]. Finally, ICD together with pharmacotherapy provides long-term life-saving protection against VT [104].
