(p4.0) We provided a narrative synthesis of the findings of the included reviews and if multiple reviews existed for the same intervention. However, in the case of ARBs, we updated the evidence and meta-analysed the data using random effects and fixed effects model with Mantel-Haenszel methods 13 and reported random effects model to account for heterogeneity. Meanwhile, we evaluated each intervention against our outcomes of interest and synthesised the evidence taking into account heterogeneity and inconsistencies between reviews. As a rule of thumb, I 2 (I-square) values of 25%, 50% and 75% correspond to low, moderate and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively. 14 For the purpose of our overview, we categorised the evidence of the included interventions into three categories: (1) effective interventions; (2) ineffective interventions; and (3) uncertain evidence (conflicting or inconclusive evidence). We used odds ratios (OR) and relative effect or risk ratio (RR) as a summary statistic from the most recent or largest published systematic reviews, and confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% with a significance level determined at two-sided alpha less than 5%.
