(p3.0) The main objective of the mobile Data Gathering technique is to reduce the overall travel time of the mobile node and also reduce the packet delay. Mobile Collectors are called as SenCars [6]. To achieve the uniform energy consumption, we combine the SDMA technique along with SenCar. This technique adopts a joint approach of Space Division Multiple Access and mobility [4]. The SDMA technique contains multiple antennas that help for concurrent data uploading to a SenCar. There are two cases namely single SenCar and multiple SenCar [8].
