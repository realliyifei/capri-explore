(p2.0) Main Findings. All the articles found the diode laser to be effective in the extirpation of lesions in the oral soft tissues. A total of four studies (9-12) compared the effectiveness of the diode laser with respect to the conventional scalpel, concluding in a clear superiority of the laser. Four articles (13)(14)(15)(16) compared the CO2 laser with the diode laser in the treatment of exophytic lesions in oral soft tissues. In relation to the Erbium family lasers, four articles (12,14,15,17) discussed their use in oral surgery for the elimination of exophytic lesions. One study (15) compared the efficacy of Nd:Yag laser compared to other lasers in the removal of oral lesions and also, only one study compared the diode laser with the electric scalpel (18). The indications found for the use of these lasers are summarized in table 1.
