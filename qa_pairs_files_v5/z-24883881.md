(p2.0) Flavonoid derivatives -were obtained as major components from either D. odorifera or other species of the genus Dalbergia [12]. In general, phytochemical studies on D. odorifera species phytochemistry showed that most of the naturally occurring mono-and bisflavonoids occurred as free forms, and their glycosyl derivatives were seldom found. As shown in Table 1 and Figures 1-4, flavonoids -can be divided into six different groups: flavones -, and isoflavones -; flavanones -, flavans -, isoflavanones -, and isoflavans -; neoflavones -; chalcones -; pterocarpans -; bisflavonoids -. The chemical index showed that most of the isolated flavonoids were isolated from heartwood. In addition, an isoflavone formononetin ( ), two flavanones (2S)-liquiritigenin ( ) and (2S)-pinocembrin ( ), an isoflavanone (3R)-sativanone ( ), a chalcone isoliquiritigenin ( ), and a pterocarpan medicarpin ( ) were found more often in the heartwood of D. odorifera species (Table 1). Of these bisflavonoids, chromatographic isolation of heartwood methanol extract provided nine new compounds -, which belonged to dimeric isoflavanones and isoflavanones [20,40]. In contrast to the conclusion of Saha et al. (2013), dimeric flavonoids were found only from D. nitidula and D. monetaria species [12].

(p7.0) A few quinones in the heartwood could have been observed with the biotransformation of phenyl units in compounds -into quinonyl units in compounds -7 (Table 1 and Figure 8) [18,28,36]. This phenomenon was also detected in flavonoids, for instance, compound . Finally, minor components -, including 2-methoxy-3-hydroxyxanthone ( ), hexanoic acid, 2-propenyl ester ( ), hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester ( ), and 3,8-nonadien-2-one ( ), were reported to exist in the heartwood and root so far [19,24].  [29,[50][51][52][53]. By far, utilizing HPLC-UV/HPLC-MS techniques, eighteen flavonoids appeared in a rat serum sample collected at 30 min after oral administration of 75% heartwood ethanol extract, comprising compounds -, , , , , -, , -, , , , and butin [54]. In other cases, the traditional Chinese medicine "Jiangxiang" was simultaneously analyzed by an offline 2D RPLC/RPLC 10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine     system incorporating a -CD based column and an Acuity UPLC BEH C18 column, in which 19 compounds were tentatively identified, comprising compounds , , , , , luteolin, melilotocarpan, 7,5,3 ,4 -tetrahydroxyflavanone, three unknown trihydroxy-trimethoxyisoflavanones [the same molecular formula C 16 [55]. Meanwhile, ten flavonoids , , , -, -, , and were isolated and identified after optimizing the separation and collection parameters from D. odorifera species using 2D Prep HPLC method with Click Oligo (ethylene glycol) and C18 column [27]. In the qualitative UPLC analysis for D. odorifera species in Hai'an, China, formononetin ( ), genistein ( ), and their glycosides (genistin and formononetin-8-C-apiosyl(1-6)-glucoside) were detected, and the authors suggested that matrix solid-phase dispersion using titania column (MSPD) was used to elute high concentration flavonoid aglycones first with 90% acetonitrile and 10% water containing 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer, followed by eluting trace flavonoid glycosides with 20% acetonitrile and 80% water containing 1% trifluoroacetate [30]. On the one hand, using HPLC-UV for qualitative analysis and deep eutectic solvent-based negative pressure cavitation assisted extraction (DES-NPCE) followed by macroporous resin column chromatography for quantitative analysis, the maximum extraction yields of four main isoflavonoids and -accounted for 1.204, 1.057, 0.911, and 2.448 mg/g dry weight D. odorifera leaves, respectively, on which three effective factors for extraction were negative pressure −0.07 MPa, temperature 45 ∘ C, and concentration of water 26% [31]. On the other hand, following the efficient microwave-assisted aqueous two-phase extraction (MA-ATPE) technique and optimized conditions, for instance, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate salt concentration 20%, absolute alcohol concentration 25%, and extraction temperature 45.5 ∘ C, the extraction yields of genistein ( ) and biochanin A ( ) reached 1.023 and 2.012 mg/g dry material (DM), and the content in extracts possessed 12.966 and 25.526 mg/g extract, respectively, in which the MA-ATPE method exhibited about 2-3-fold higher value than those of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) [the extraction yields of 0.899 and 1.915 mg/g DM; content in extracts of 5.212 and 11.101 mg/g extract, resp.] and heat reflux extraction (HRE) [the extraction yields of 0.924 and 1.715 mg/g DM; content in extracts of 4.897 and 9.086 mg/g extract, resp.] [14]. Similarly, based on optimal conditions including three extraction cycles, time 20 min, negative pressure −0.05 MPa, ethanol concentration 66%, and liquid/solid ratio 24 : 1 mL/g, NPCE extraction method showed that the extraction yields of compoundswere 1.579 and 0.935 mg/g, respectively, when compared with 1.212 and 0.941 mg/g for HRE and 1.402 and 0.914 mg/g for ultrasound-assisted extraction (USE) methods, respectively [56]. Furthermore, using the combination of AL-2 macroporous resin and flash chromatography conditions [silica gel; n-hexane : ethyl acetate; sample : silica gel ratio 1.3 : 40; and flow rate: 50 mL/min], the content of compoundsin the enriched product of leaves reached 27.20% and 6.79% [32].
## (s10) Antioxidant Activities.
Number of References: 17

(p10.0) Frequently, naturally occurring phenols and flavonoids not only were shown to be major components in the genus Dalbergia but also have been the focus of biological assays [12]. The several therapeutic uses of medicinal plant D. odorifera species might be related to mostly flavonoids, especially in terms of the possible role of flavonoids in the prevention of oxidative stress. Admittedly, the potential antioxidant activity of flavonoids was figured out by chelating with metal ions, which therefore prevented their participation in free radical generation reactions [25,59]. In an extensive research to identify the antioxidant bioassay of isolated flavonoids from heartwood of D. odorifera species, a flavanone eriodictyol ( ) and a neoflavone 3 -hydroxymelanettin ( ) exhibited stronger activity than commonly used synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), as far as compounds -, -, and in all three methods: oil stability index (OSI), potassium ferricyanide reducing power, and 2,2-azinobis(3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radical (ABTS •+ ) scavenging [33]. To take the concentration 0.012% and OSI method as an example, compounds and established the antioxidant protection factor (Pf) values of 6.48 and 4.20, respectively, whereas compounds -, -, and ranged from 1.09 to 1.13 (if Pf < 1, the sample had prooxidant activity; if Pf = 1, the sample had no antioxidant activity; if 1 < Pf < 2, the sample had antioxidant activity; if Pf > 3, the sample had strong antioxidant activity), as compared to this one of 3.61 of positive control BHT. As a result, the most striking feature in relation to structural characterization was the strong activity of compounds and due to ortho-hydroxyl unit in ring B, along with internal hydrogen bond between 5-hydroxyl group and carbonyl group C(4)=O which might eliminate catalytic oxidation performance of the trace amounts of metal ions [33]. Similarly, among nine tested components , , , , , , and -, at the concentration of 0.02% or with 0.04% and 100 ∘ C, the Pf values of six of them , , , , , and were more than 3, while three unsaturated fatty acids -had Pf values lower than 2 in the OSI method [19]. Particularly, a chemical component was found in heartwood and root; namely, (3R)-2 ,3 ,7-trihydroxy-4 -methoxyisoflavanone ( ) displayed a Pf value 3-fold higher than positive control BHT andtocopherol in both concentrations 0.02% and 0.04%, which might be reasonable from three adjacent, two hydroxyl, and one methoxy groups [19,20,34].

(p10.1) In the third case of OSI model, at the concentration 0.1 mM, compounds , , , , BHT, and -tocopherol had Pf of 2.79, 2.70, 3.31, 2.32, 4.21, and 3.72, respectively [25]. Meantime, at the concentration 0.2 mM and 100 ∘ C, the Pf values of 4.67, 3.30, 4.81, 3.50, 5.82, and 4.21 were nominated for the above compounds, respectively, or, with the concentration 0.1 mM adding Fe 3+ (4 M) and at 100 ∘ C, all tested compounds , , , and were found to have Pf values of 0.9, 1.25, 1.96, and 1.79, respectively. Furthermore, compounds , , , and also showed inhibitory effects on the antioxidant systematic glutathione (GSH) level decrease of rat lens induced by UV irradiation comparable with positive control -tocopherol [at the concentration 0.43 mM, a range of 27.1-29.7 for tested compounds and 26.2 g GSH/g tissue for positive control; at the concentration 0.86 mM, a range of 38.8-39.4 for tested compounds and 39.5 g GSH/g tissue for positive control] [25].

(p10.2) A poorly aqueous soluble chalcone butein ( ) was precipitated out of methanol extract of D. odorifera species heartwood [18,24,46], which was chelated with metal ions Fe 2+ (UV max : 286 and 422 nm) and Cu 2+ (286 and 454 nm) and shown as a potential antioxidant agent with iron-induced lipid peroxidation inhibition in rat brain homogenate in a concentration-dependent manner with the IC 50 value of 3.3± 0.4 M, IC 0.002 value of 9.2±1.8 M in DPPH reducing experiment (which was more significant than reference compound -tocopherol 11.9 ± 0.2 M and BHT 14.5 ± 2.5 M), and IC 50 value of 5.9 ± 0.3 M in xanthine oxidase-induced uric acid formation inhibitory activity [46]. Besides that, each molecule of compound scavenged the peroxyl radical derived from 1.4 molecules of 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane dihydrochloride) (AAPH) in aqueous phase, but not that from 2,2-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (100 mM) in hexane, adding that this compound, which has been used as an inhibitor against Cu 2+ -induced thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) of human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) with an IC 50 value of 6.3 ± 0.2 M and 30 M butein ( ), could reduce the electrophoretic change of oxidatively modified LDL [46]. However, at the concentration 100 M, this compound did not react with H 2 O 2 (0.5-1.0 mM) and inhibited the hydroxyl radical-induced deoxyribose degradation [46].
## (s11) Anti-Inflammatory
Number of References: 59

(p11.0) Activities. Inflammation can be seen as a part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as irradiation, physical damage, metabolic overload, or infection [60]. Nuclear factor-B (NF-B) activation has been playing a central role in inflammatory reactions [4,37], while macrophages played an important role in regulating inflammatory responses via production of various proinflammatory cytokines and proinflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-), and interleukin-1 (IL-1 ) [4,37,43]. Additionally, nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expressions also conducted production levels of NO and prostaglandin PGE2 [61]. Normally, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as an inflammatory stimulant in the anti-inflammatory experiments as it induces NF-B activation through phosphorylation of I B inhibitor [4,37,61]. Hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) was an enzyme that catalyzed the degradation of heme to generate carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and free iron, and it also has been involved in the reduction of proneuroinflammatory mediators and inflammatory expressions [4,5,37,43]. Therefore, HO-1 and its related by-products can be seen as the critical regulators of inflammation with macrophages acting as the critical targets [44]. Diseases related to inflammation include arthritis, hepatitis, septic shock syndrome, neuronal disorders caused by extensive and uncontrolled injuries, or irregular inflammatory responses [37,61]. Among them, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or Huntington's disease have been increasing in recent decades, which was closely related to the activity of proinflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) in microglia [61]. Consequently, anti-inflammatory drugs of medicinal plants have been receiving much more attention from researchers. For instance, more recently, the phytoconstituent plumericin from the Amazonian plant Himatanthus sucuuba improved as a new potential agent of NF-kB pathway in both anti-inflammatory in vitro and in vivo experiments [60].

(p11.1) We now present notes on several isolated compounds from D. odorifera species. First of all, a neoflavone derivative gave cell viability with the concentration range of 10-80 M, in which the amounts of NO, PGE2, TNF-, and IL-1 production, iNOS and COX-2 expressions, IkBphosphorylation and degradation, NF-kB (p65) translocation, and NF-kB DNA-binding activity were reduced with increasing concentration of compound from 10 to 80 M in LPS (1 g/mL) stimulated primary murine peritoneal macrophages, whereas the same results were found in the concentration range of 5-40 M for 4,2 ,5 -trihydroxy-4methoxychalcone ( ) [37,45] [37,45]. In addition, 80 M latifolin ( ) gave increased nuclear Nrf2 levels and decreased cytoplasmic Nrf2 levels in 15-120 min treatment, as compared to 40 M 4,2 ,5 -trihydroxy-4 -methoxychalcone ( ) in 0.5-1.5 h treatment. Furthermore, compound gradually increased ARE luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner from 10 to 80 M and stabilized at 120 min [37]. In addition, the role of Nrf2 in HO-1 expression was also studied using Nrf2 siRNA against Nrf2, in which transient transfection with Nrf2 siRNA completely suppressed HO-1 protein expression by compound (40 M) [45]. Second, isoliquiritigenin ( ) did not show cytotoxicity for RAW 264.7 macrophages event at concentration 20 M, and at the concentration 10 M, compound displayed the results in inhibitory percentage of 86 and 79% for NO and IL-1 production when LPS (200 ng/mL) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, respectively, and absolutely inhibited iNOS mRNA and protein and TNF-mRNA expression [44]. In addition, the inhibition of LPS (200 ng/ml) induced NO and TNF-production by compound (10 M) was related to its ability to induce HO-1 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence or absence of 20 M SnPP [44]. Besides, we observed an increase in the levels of HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in RAW264.7 macrophages when examined with compound (1-10 M), while mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) signal inhibitory experiment confirmed that the induction of HO-1 by compound (10 or 20 M) was inhibited by ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 but failed in selective JNK inhibitor SP600125 or p38 inhibitor SB203580 in a dose-dependent manner [44]. In the third case, a neoflavone 9-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxydalbergiquinol ( ) and two arylbenzofuran derivatives, (2R,3R)-obtusafuran ( ) and isoparvifuran ( ), were derived from D. odorifera heartwood; the viability of cells incubated with various concentrations of neoflavone (5-50 M) and two arylbenzofurans and (1-20 M) was not affected significantly in BV2 microglia; compounds and inhibited the levels of proinflammatory mediators NO, PGE 2 , TNF-, and IL-1 , with the results of decreased iNOS and COX-2 appearing when BV2 microglia were stimulated by LPS at the doses of 500 ng/mL and 1 g/mL, respectively; however, compound did not show any decreased levels of the above proinflammatory agents and iNOS and COX-2 expressions event at concentration of 20 M [4,5]. Hence, we paid further attention to compounds and , in which two compounds (5-40 M) and

(p11.2) (1-20 M) also revealed reduction in the levels of IkB-phosphorylation and degradation, NF-kB (p65 and p50) translocation, and NF-kB DNA-binding activity in LPS at the doses of 500 ng/mL and 1 g/mL, respectively, stimulating BV2 microglia [4,5]. As the same way of 4,2 ,5 -trihydroxy-4 -methoxychalcone ( ) in primary murine peritoneal macrophages, 9-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxydalbergiquinol ( ) and (2R,3R)-obtusafuran ( ) possessed the highest HO-1 expression at the concentrations of 40 and 20 M, respectively, and also indicated increased nuclear Nrf2 levels and decreased cytoplasmic Nrf2 levels in 0.5-1.5 h treatment, and transient transfection with Nrf2 siRNA absolutely inhibited HO-1 protein expression in BV2 microglia [4,5]. Followed by using an inhibitor of HO-1, SnPP (50 M) partially reversed the inhibitory effects of compound (40 M) on LPS (1 g/mL) induced NO, PGE2, TNF-, and IL-1 levels and resembled the procedures of compound (20 M) when LPS (500 ng/mL) stimulated BV2 microglia [4,5]. By far, utilizing 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide salt (MTT) in the assay of cell viability, activated microgliamediated cell death of mouse hippocampal HT22 cells was significantly repressed by compound (1-20 M) after 24 h incubation [4]. In a continued case, at the noncytotoxic concentrations (10-80 M), phytoconstituent reduced the amounts of NO, PGE2, TNF-, IL-1 , iNOS, and COX-2 protein inmunocontents using LPS (0.5 g/mL) stimulated BV2 microglia, which were identical to the procedures of compounds and [43]. At the highest nontoxic concentration 80 M of compound , HO-1 expression reached the highest level in either HT22 cells or BV2 microglia, and the time course of HO-1 induction evidently revealed that protein was first detectable 6 h after treatment, peaked around 18 h, and reduced after 12 h in both cells [43]. Possibly, this was similar to cases of compounds and ; SnPP (50 M) has been playing as an inhibitor for reversing the inhibitory effects of compound (80 M) on HO-1 induction in two cells, as well as proinflammatory mediators NO, PGE 2 , TNF-, and IL-1 production in the experiment of using LPS (0.5 g/mL) stimulated BV2 microglia [4,5,43]. Twentysix flavonoids -, -, , -, -, , -, -, -, , and -and one xanthone derivative were isolated from ethyl acetate soluble fraction of D. odorifera heartwood by following their potential to inhibit the LPS-induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 cells Leukotrienes (LTs) C 4 , D 4 , and E 4 , are members of lipid mediators formed by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism; in addition, leukotrienes were involved in bronchoconstriction, inflammation, microvascular permeability, and mucus secretion in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [62]. Inflammatory aspects, neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages usually possessed production of leukotrienes to promote inflammatory diseases [39]. In current surveys of potential leukotriene inhibitors from medicinal plant D. odorifera species, methylene chloride and chloroform extracts exhibited inhibitory ability of LTC 4 production in AB-CXBG Mct-1 mastocytoma cells with IC 50 values of 0.52 (80%) and 3.0 g/ml, respectively, while two compounds and were obtained from chloroform extracts that displayed LTC 4 inhibitory activity with the IC 50s values of 0.5 and 0.05 M [39]. Besides, arylbenzofuran derivative acted as a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase with an IC 50 value of 0.08 M against the soluble rat enzyme; however, it was inactive against cyclooxygenase [39].

(p11.3) Regarding cytoprotection of HT22 cells by antioxidative agents, glutamate cytotoxicity was responsible for the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and was closely related to neuronal degeneration in central nervous system diseases, for instance, epilepsy and ischemia [28,43]. Glutamate toxicity induced neuronal cell death via both receptor-initiated excitotoxicity and non-receptor-mediated oxidative stress [28,43]. As far as we know, the immortalized mouse hippocampal HT22 cells have shown good advances for studying oxidative glutamate toxicity due to the fact that they were similar to neuronal precursor cells but lacked functional ionotropic glutamate receptors, hence excluding excitotoxicity as a cause for glutamate triggered cell death [43]. The glutamate-induced oxidative injury in HT22 cells model was also applied in these researches of isolated compounds from D. odorifera heartwood, including  [43].

(p11.4) Activated neutrophils release lysosomal enzymes and generate highly reactive oxygen species [18]. The number of lysozymes secreted by stimulated rat neutrophils tended to exceed the amount of -glucuronidase [63]. The uncontrolled release of -glucuronidase and lysozymes may deleteriously injure adjacent cells [18].  [18]. In the mast cell degranulation experiment, the order of IC 50 values of 17.6, 17.9, 22.3, 53.7, and 71.6 M was assignable to compounds , , positive control mepacrine, , and , respectively, against the release of -glucuronidase [18]. Additionally, these compounds also provided evidence on antiallergic activity, with IC 50 values of 16.3, 20.0, 37.1, 51.1, and 14.7 M for compounds , , , , and positive control mepacrine, respectively [18]. It was therefore assumed that cearoin and (S)-4-methoxydalbergione ( ) could be antiallergic agents [18].
## (s14) Vasorelaxant Activities.
Number of References: 6

(p14.0) As far as we know, secondary messengers such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) are currently the most well documented cyclic nucleotides which were used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms. In most cases, the elevation of cAMP and cGMP concentrations possessed independent inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [47,66]. The intracellular concentrations of cAMP and cGMP were identified by their rate of formation through agonist induced stimulation of adenylate and guanylate cyclases [47]. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes that break phosphodiesterase bonds and hence play a central role in regulating intracellular levels of the second messengers cAMP and cGMP [67]. PDEs I, II, and III can utilize both cAMP and cGMP as a substrate, while numerous cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isoenzymes PDEs I, III, IV, and V act as degradable agents of cGMP by hydrolysis [47]. It is therefore suggested that selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been playing roles in relaxing smooth muscles. In the current review paper, butein ( ) also participated in investigating the phenylephrine precontracted rat aorta by measuring tension, cAMP and cGMP levels, adenylate and guanylate cyclases, and phosphodiesterase isoenzyme activities [47]. First, in the results, latent relaxation of compound on rat aortic rings precontracted with various vasoconstrictors, phenylephrine (3 M), KCl (60 mM), U-46619 (1 M), endothelin-1 (1 nM), and angiotensin II (3 M), received EC 50 values of 7.4 ± 1.6, 10.5 ± 2.3, 14.3 ± 3.3, 11.8 ± 2.0, and 13.6 ± 3.7 M, respectively. Second, this isolated compound with the concentration range of 1-100 M caused endothelium-dependent relaxation of rat aorta precontracted with phenylephrine, but it was abolished in endothelium denuded aorta and in endothelium in the presence of 300 M N G -monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, an inhibitor of larginine nitric oxide), 10 M oxyhemoglobin (bound to nitric oxide), and 50 M methylene blue (a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor); however, this effect was unchanged by 10 M indomethacin or 100 nM charybdotoxin. It was clearly shown that the vasorelaxant effect of compound is dependent on endothelium and was mediated by endothelium derived relaxing factor. Third, compound (1-100 M) increased both cAMP and cGMP in the state of incubation between this compound and endothelium intact aorta; for example, butein (100 M) caused a 4.1 ± 0.3and 2.9 ± 0.3-fold increase in rat aorta, respectively. Fourth, using diethylaminoethyl-(DEAE-) Sephacel chromatography, four phosphodiesterase forms were isolated from rat aorta, in which cAMP-specific PDE-IV was potently inhibited by butein ( ) and rolipram with IC 50 values of 10.4 ± 0.4 and 3.2 ± 0.2 M, respectively; typical PDEs I, III, and IV were controlled by compound with an IC 50 value of more than 100 M. Fifth, adenylate and guanylate cyclases levels did not change by 30 or with 100 M butein ( ). Last but not least, in the absence of endothelium, coadministration of 0.01 M cAMP-isoprenaline (a -adrenoceptor agonist) or with 0.01 M cAMP-forskolin (an adenylate cyclase activator) did not significantly modify the effects elicited by butein ( ), but 1 nM cGMP-sodium nitroprusside (a soluble guanylate cyclase activator) or 0.01 M cGMP-trequinsin (a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor) still enhanced the relaxant effects of butein ( ), and 0.1 M of isoprenaline and forskolin still weakly but significantly enhanced the relaxant effect of butein ( ) in endothelium denuded aorta; however, in the presence of endothelium, all tested components gave potent effects on the relaxant activities of butein ( ).
