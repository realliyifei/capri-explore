## (s0) Background
Number of References: 4

(p0.0) Infective endocarditis (IE) is caused by infection of the heart valve blood by fungi and bacteria (this bacteremia can cause septic symptoms) and their vegetative growth, which consists mainly of platelets, microorganisms and fibrins. The superficial growth can cause embolism in many organs such as the kidneys, lungs, skin, brain, and central nervous system, leading to signs of divergence. If the patient with infective endocarditis does not receive adequate treatment, the disease can be lethal [1]. Diagnosis of IE is still difficult, although blood culturing methods, accurate diagnostic criteria and echocardiography have improved [2,3]. Clinician may also notice possible illnesses such as stroke, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, meningitis, nephritis, collagenosis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections due to the variety of symptoms in this disease [1].
## (s3) IE In children

(p3.0) Infectious endocarditis is a life-threatening disease in children's communities. The disease is associated with high mortality [15]. According to some studies, the prevalence of infectious endocarditis in children was lower than in adults, and the rate of hospitalization in children was lower. The prevalence of infective endocarditis is higher in children with CHD and underlying rheumatic disease [16].

(p3.1) Approximately 35-60% of IE infections have CHD, which is a risk factor for IE in children. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common causes of IE in highincome countries. The clinical features of the disease in children vary, which can include weight loss, fever, heart damage, or septic embolization [17,18].
## (s4) Molecular genetic methods and histology in valvular culture

(p4.0) Examination of the heart valve is the gold standard for diagnosing the IE [1,3,24]. If positive, we can identify pathogens in biopsy of the valves from an IE patient by using culture including Gram stain [25]. Histological methods include histochemistry [26] or molecular genetic methods such as PCR [27][28][29] (Fig. 1). Due to the high concentration of microorganisms in plants, these methods can be used and most of them can be successfully identified [1] by the ways, valvular culture has low negative predictive value for detecting the microorganisms (56%) [28] because of its low sensitivity (15%) [30], (13%) [28]], and it is not high specified [31]. However, due to the contamination of the heart valve, we may also see a false positive result in the sample cut from the heart valve during surgery [31]. Sometimes microorganisms detected by methods such as histopathology or PCR from the heart valve may remain there for months after the IE patient has recovered; Therefore, in addition to the experimental methods used, we must ensure the clinical diagnosis of the presence or absence of IE in the patient [25,[32][33][34].
## (s6) Infective Endocarditis caused by hacek microorganisms Endocarditis caused by HACEK organisms

(p6.0) HACEK endocarditis mostly affects most patients with heart disease or artificial valves, and is characterized by an insidious course, with a mean diagnosis delay of 1 month (Haemophilus spp.) to 3 months (Aggregatibacter and Cardiobacterium spp.) [39]. In Olmsted County, Minnesota, about 0.14 of every 100,000 people develop  [39].

(p6.1) Bacteria of the HACEK group are grouped together in infectious endocarditis due to similar characteristics such as: presence in the pharyngeal microbiota, low virulence, similar infections and most importantly (IE) [41]. Hardgrowing Gram-negative organisms of primary oral origin are the main cause of infectious endocarditis [39]. Common features of HACEK microorganisms are that they grow slowly and often colonize the oropharynx, and if we add CO 2 in their medium culture, their growth will be enhanced [40].
## (s9) Treatments

(p9.0) Delay in diagnosis and its complications can be fatal for humans. Ampicillin in combination with gentamicin [62] is standard treatment for 4 weeks for normal valve infection and for 6 weeks for synthetic valve infection. Surgical procedures follow the recommendations of the Endocarditis Working Group of the International Society of Chemotherapy [72]. The guidelines recommend that ampicillin-resistant organisms be considered because of the difficulty in detecting susceptibility and the potential for resistance among HACEK microorganisms. Therefore, broad-spectrum cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones are considered the first line of treatment for HE (HACEK endocarditis) [73,74].
