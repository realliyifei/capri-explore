(p17.0) Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) methods were first proposed in 2D space [138] and then gradually extended to point cloud data registration in the fields of robotics and photogrammetry [139][140][141].

(p17.1) Applications of NDT are common in mobile robotics, mainly because the robot can obtain the positional relation between two points through the rangefinder when measuring data. With direct initial transformation, the NDT algorithm can be used to quickly and simply achieve fine registration of point clouds. The main idea of this method is to convert point cloud data in a 3D grid into a continuously differentiable probability distribution function. The probability distribution of the samples of each 3D point position measurement in the grid cell is represented by a normal distribution. Subsequently, the probability of normal distribution of two point cloud data sets is optimized using the Hessian Matrix method to achieve point cloud registration [139]. A key process in the NDT algorithm is to build grids for point clouds, but grid size is difficult to determine. The use of different grid sizes to organize point clouds therefore becomes an effective way to establish grids for 3D point clouds [142][143][144].
