## (s5) Immunological interlinks of malignancy and SARS-CoV2 infection
Number of References: 18

(p5.0) 'Cytokine Release Syndrome', a distinct feature of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer refers to the unimpeded overabundance of cytokines which can lead to vascular leakage, coagulopathy, organ dysfunction, and death [56]. IL-6 (Interleukin-6) is a vital component of the unrestricted cytokine storm seen in COVID-19 and is also deemed as a mediator in the transition of malignancy of lungs [56,57]. Inflammation and carcinogen exposure (example: tobacco smoking) expedites NF-kB signaling pathway which induces KRAS mutations to trigger direct expression of IL-6 on lung epithelial cells [58]. Overexpressed IL-6 espouses lung cancer proliferation and migration through STAT3 signaling [59]. With SARS-CoV-2 infection, Escalated amounts of IL-6 has been found to be associated with disease severity, increased viral load and a contributing factor to complications such as 'Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome' (ARDS) [60].

(p7.0) Tremendous progress in sequencing-based technologies has made it possible to detect neoplasm specific epigenetic signatures and epigenetic heterogeneity which are mostly observed in solid tumors [72]. Using suitable controls and genome-wide profiling, cancer-associated changes of DNA methylation, global hypomethylation, and focal hypermethylation were determined as early marks in tumorigenesis. Alterations accumulating in the epigenome can therefore be used to predict cancer risks. [73,74].

## (s8) Epigenetics of the pan-cancer analyses
Number of References: 108

(p8.0) Some recent studies are trying to explain SARS-CoV-2 disease severity from an epigenetic perspective. According to data derived from several studies, epigenetic modifications indeed have been found to contribute significantly in the severity progression of COVID-19 [51,56,57] via altering the overall process from the initial viral interaction with host ACE2, to the subsequent viral pathophysiology [75][76][77].

(p8.1) Some pan-cancer analyses also tried to investigate epigenetic changes associated with the pivotal host genes to comprehend more about their differential expressions. To explore the influence of epigenetic modification on the mRNA levels for CTSL and ACE2 in PAAD and STAD, CpG probes targeted the promoters of the CTSL and ACE2 genes, respectively [32]. With a combination of Methylation450k profiles and the DiseaseMeth database [78]; the results demonstrated that DNA methylation of CTSL is significantly decreased in PAAD but not in STAD when compared with normal tissues. DNMIVD (DNA Methylation Interactive Visualization Database) analyses showed negative correlation of ACE2 methylation with PAAD and STAD [79]. Using the Ualcan database, expression of ACE2 from GEPIA were correlated with the methylation status. For most of the cancers there was a strong correlation of the gene expression with its promoter methylation status in agreement with the findings for ACE-2 [35] [80]. CTSL in COAD and READ has a higher beta value and resultant lower expression of the gene. In case of STAD, the lower methylation of the promoter, leads to higher expression. In LUSC and BRCA, the very high methylation rate of the TMPRSS2 gene leads to a very low expression level, while the very low methylation rate of the same gene in PRAD and READ lead to very high numbers of gene transcripts [35]. In terms of different cancer types, the same epigenetic mark can be associated with diverse expression levels. Without incorporation of large-scale wet lab experimentations with such in-silico analyses, a comprehensive picture about the significance of epigenetic changes to link up malignancy and COVID-19 is harder to manifest.

## (s9) Consequences of epigenetic changes in IL-6 and ACE2 associated with COVID-19
Number of References: 30

(p9.0) Yao et al. conducted a study to elucidate the regulatory effect of chromosome 3p21.31 (genetic susceptibility locus for COVID-19) [81] in immune cell lines (THP-1, HL-60, Jurkat, and K562 resembling human monocytes, promyelocyte, T lymphocytes, and erythroid respectively) [18]. With CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genomic deletion, CCR9 and SLC6A20 were found to be target genes in the locus. Their investigation revealed six fine-mapped variants (rs34326463, rs76374459, rs73064425, rs13081482, rs35652899, and rs35044562) overlapping human T-cell specific primed enhancers. These findings insinuate of an epigenetic regulatory mechanism that can influence the T cell functions towards SARS-Cov-2 infection [18].

(p9.1) IL-6 can regulate the expression and functions of multiple genes by inhibiting methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3B [19,20]. In inflammation-induced ARDS, [82] IL-6 is activated in dendritic cells by the acetylation of transcription factor KLF4 [83]. A combination of epigenetic phosphorylation and acetylation marks on Herpes virus encoded viral IL-6 can induce STAT3 activity [84]. All these prior studies strengthen the assumption that IL-6 may be epigenetically altered in case of COVID-19 infection. To test such assumption, using Chip-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets from 839 and 157 cell/tissue types of humans and mice through ENCODE respectively (https://www.encodeproject.org/) [85]; Sang et al. discovered significant comparative existence of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac markers between IL-6 and ACE2 gene promoters in various humans and mouse samples. Interestingly, such epigenetic enrichment were found in greater quantity in these human genes compared to their mouse orthologs. In both distal and proximal regions of the hACE2 (Human ACE2) gene promoters, 2-3-fold more positive histone modifications marking insinuate of higher ACE2 activation and transcription compared to their mouse counterparts. According to their findings, elevated expression of non-ISGs (Interferon Stimulated Genes) such as IL-6 and ACE2 could be biomarkers for the exacerbation of inflammation underlying some viral infections, especially those similar to SARS-CoV-2, which dysregulate the physiological function of ACE2 in the RAAS-centric body system [76].
## (s10) Epigenetic changes associated with vaccination

(p10.0) Another mentionable epigenetic findings relevant to COVID-19 infection is associated with vaccination. Exposure to live Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is found to boost pathogen-agnostic antimicrobial resistance in myeloid cells via changes in chromatin conformations. Resultant conformational modifications in innate immune cells can confer epigenetic change in form of a pattern of exposed enhancers and promoters of host-defense genes. Such epigenetic changes may plausibly show accelerated responsiveness in its ability to influence gene expression which may show resistance against infectious diseases, including Covid-19. [96,97].

## (s13) Reports from COVID-19 and cancer taskforce
Number of References: 27

(p13.0) After ensuring the cancer patient group as a priority group for vaccination, an inequitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines should also be maintained, especially in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). A global system like COVAX is trying to ensure unbiased vaccine distribution in LMICs but only can cover 20% of the populations of recipient countries [108]. To understand more about the implication of COVID-19 on the vulnerable malignancy patients, COVID-19 and Cancer Taskforce commenced the investigation into the current global availability of COVID-19 vaccines and the variety of national strategies for covering cancer patients and health-care workers till March 31, 2021 [109]. A diversified global picture ranging from well-advanced vaccination programs for patients with cancer (UK) to countries without any vaccine supplies (Iraq and Guatemala) came into being by the Taskforce's reports. Another mentionable finding is the variability seen among countries on the mass vaccination campaigns in terms of planning, procurement, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Of the 29 countries with access to any type of COVID-19 vaccine, patients with cancer are prioritized only in 9 (26%). Regrettably, with mentionable exception as the VOICE, a multi-center, multi-cohort study based in Netherland which consist of patients with solid malignancies receiving active anticancer treatment who have been vaccinated against COVID-19; very few national systemic data collection from patients with cancer receiving COVID-19 vaccines exist [110]. The inability to access vaccines is the single most cataclysmic obstacle to receive vaccines for many patients with cancer in some of the most vulnerable settings. But lack of proper management and failure in inclusiveness of cancer patients in mass vaccination campaigns are found to exist in well-resourced health systems too. Prioritized, fast COVID-19 vaccination of health-care workers and cancer patients is indispensable to alleviate the existing delay in providing proper cancer treatment.

## (s15) Consequences of EPR effect on liposome carried based vaccines
Number of References: 54

(p15.0) A very interesting problem of vaccination can be the EPR [Enhanced Permeation and Retention] effect, a phenomenon where lipid based nanoparticles easily leave the blood flow and reach cancer cells provided that their size is less than 200 nm. Reduced lymphatic drainage also contribute to the accumulation of such nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment after leaking out of the blood vessels [117,118]. Two of the advanced, successful vaccine candidates (Moderna mRNA-1273 and Pfizer BNT162b2) are both delivered enclosed in liposomes (<200 nm particles) which theoretically make them vulnerable to the EPR effect resulting in a possible misplaced accumulation of the target therapeutics in tumor surroundings [98,99]. The possibility of this occurrence taking place in solid tumor patients is a concerning issue regarding COVID-19 vaccination which unfortunately has limited clinical data about active cancer patients; mostly because their lesser participation in the clinical trials. If this EPR effect actually materializes; COVID-19 vaccines, especially the carrier liposomes should be modified. But an assuring fact is that COVID-19 vaccines are administered by the intramuscular (IM) route, and the preclinical data suggest that encapsulated proteins in liposomes administered intramuscularly do not amass at a neoplastic site and systemically is distributed across the body [119]. Nonetheless, the efficacy of the promising mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered enclosed in nano-lipid carriers should be assessed cautiously among solid tumor patients and associated clinical data should be rigorously listed and monitored [120].

Interestingly, such epigenetic enrichment were found in greater quantity in these human genes compared to their mouse orthologs. In both distal and proximal regions of the hACE2 (Human ACE2) gene promoters, 2-3-fold more positive histone modifications marking insinuate of higher ACE2 activation and transcription compared to their mouse counterparts. According to their findings, elevated expression of non-ISGs (Interferon Stimulated Genes) such as IL-6 and ACE2 could be biomarkers for the exacerbation of inflammation underlying some viral infections, especially those similar to SARS-CoV-2, which dysregulate the physiological function of ACE2 in the RAAS-centric body system [76].

(p36.0) Another mentionable epigenetic findings relevant to COVID-19 infection is associated with vaccination. Exposure to live Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is found to boost pathogen-agnostic antimicrobial resistance in myeloid cells via changes in chromatin conformations. Resultant conformational modifications in innate immune cells can confer epigenetic change in form of a pattern of exposed enhancers and promoters of host-defense genes. Such epigenetic changes may plausibly show accelerated responsiveness in its ability to influence gene expression which may show resistance against infectious diseases, including Covid-19. [96,97].

(p39.0) After ensuring the cancer patient group as a priority group for vaccination, an inequitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines should also be maintained, especially in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). A global system like COVAX is trying to ensure unbiased vaccine distribution in LMICs but only can cover 20% of the populations of recipient countries [108]. To understand more about the implication of COVID-19 on the vulnerable malignancy patients, COVID-19 and Cancer Taskforce commenced the investigation into the current global availability of COVID-19 vaccines and the variety of national strategies for covering cancer patients and health-care workers till March 31, 2021 [109]. A diversified global picture ranging from well-advanced vaccination programs for patients with cancer (UK) to countries without any vaccine supplies (Iraq and Guatemala) came into being by the Taskforce's reports. Another mentionable finding is the variability seen among countries on the mass vaccination campaigns in terms of planning, procurement, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Of the 29 countries with access to any type of COVID-19 vaccine, patients with cancer are prioritized only in 9 (26%). Regrettably, with mentionable exception as the VOICE, a multi-center, multi-cohort study based in Netherland which consist of patients with solid malignancies receiving active anticancer treatment who have been vaccinated against COVID-19; very few national systemic data collection from patients with cancer receiving COVID-19 vaccines exist [110]. The inability to access vaccines is the single most cataclysmic obstacle to receive vaccines for many patients with cancer in some of the most vulnerable settings. But lack of proper management and failure in inclusiveness of cancer patients in mass vaccination campaigns are found to exist in well-resourced health systems too. Prioritized, fast COVID-19 vaccination of health-care workers and cancer patients is indispensable to alleviate the existing delay in providing proper cancer treatment.

## (s41) Consequences of EPR effect on liposome carried based vaccines
Number of References: 54

(p41.0) A very interesting problem of vaccination can be the EPR [Enhanced Permeation and Retention] effect, a phenomenon where lipid based nanoparticles easily leave the blood flow and reach cancer cells provided that their size is less than 200 nm. Reduced lymphatic drainage also contribute to the accumulation of such nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment after leaking out of the blood vessels [117,118]. Two of the advanced, successful vaccine candidates (Moderna mRNA-1273 and Pfizer BNT162b2) are both delivered enclosed in liposomes (<200 nm particles) which theoretically make them vulnerable to the EPR effect resulting in a possible misplaced accumulation of the target therapeutics in tumor surroundings [98,99]. The possibility of this occurrence taking place in solid tumor patients is a concerning issue regarding COVID-19 vaccination which unfortunately has limited clinical data about active cancer patients; mostly because their lesser participation in the clinical trials. If this EPR effect actually materializes; COVID-19 vaccines, especially the carrier liposomes should be modified. But an assuring fact is that COVID-19 vaccines are administered by the intramuscular (IM) route, and the preclinical data suggest that encapsulated proteins in liposomes administered intramuscularly do not amass at a neoplastic site and systemically is distributed across the body [119]. Nonetheless, the efficacy of the promising mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered enclosed in nano-lipid carriers should be assessed cautiously among solid tumor patients and associated clinical data should be rigorously listed and monitored [120].

## (s57) Immunological interlinks of malignancy and SARS-CoV2 infection

(p57.0) 'Cytokine Release Syndrome', a distinct feature of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer refers to the unimpeded overabundance of cytokines which can lead to vascular leakage, coagulopathy, organ dysfunction, and death [56]. IL-6 (Interleukin-6) is a vital component of the unrestricted cytokine storm seen in COVID-19 and is also deemed as a mediator in the transition of malignancy of lungs [56,57]. Inflammation and carcinogen exposure (example: tobacco smoking) expedites NF-kB signaling pathway which induces KRAS mutations to trigger direct expression of IL-6 on lung epithelial cells [58]. Overexpressed IL-6 espouses lung cancer proliferation and migration through STAT3 signaling [59]. With SARS-CoV-2 infection, Escalated amounts of IL-6 has been found to be associated with disease severity, increased viral load and a contributing factor to complications such as 'Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome' (ARDS) [60].

(p59.0) Tremendous progress in sequencing-based technologies has made it possible to detect neoplasm specific epigenetic signatures and epigenetic heterogeneity which are mostly observed in solid tumors [72]. Using suitable controls and genome-wide profiling, cancer-associated changes of DNA methylation, global hypomethylation, and focal hypermethylation were determined as early marks in tumorigenesis. Alterations accumulating in the epigenome can therefore be used to predict cancer risks. [73,74].

## (s60) Epigenetics of the pan-cancer analyses
Number of References: 108

(p60.0) Some recent studies are trying to explain SARS-CoV-2 disease severity from an epigenetic perspective. According to data derived from several studies, epigenetic modifications indeed have been found to contribute significantly in the severity progression of COVID-19 [51,56,57] via altering the overall process from the initial viral interaction with host ACE2, to the subsequent viral pathophysiology [75][76][77].

(p60.1) Some pan-cancer analyses also tried to investigate epigenetic changes associated with the pivotal host genes to comprehend more about their differential expressions. To explore the influence of epigenetic modification on the mRNA levels for CTSL and ACE2 in PAAD and STAD, CpG probes targeted the promoters of the CTSL and ACE2 genes, respectively [32]. With a combination of Methylation450k profiles and the DiseaseMeth database [78]; the results demonstrated that DNA methylation of CTSL is significantly decreased in PAAD but not in STAD when compared with normal tissues. DNMIVD (DNA Methylation Interactive Visualization Database) analyses showed negative correlation of ACE2 methylation with PAAD and STAD [79]. Using the Ualcan database, expression of ACE2 from GEPIA were correlated with the methylation status. For most of the cancers there was a strong correlation of the gene expression with its promoter methylation status in agreement with the findings for ACE-2 [35] [80]. CTSL in COAD and READ has a higher beta value and resultant lower expression of the gene. In case of STAD, the lower methylation of the promoter, leads to higher expression. In LUSC and BRCA, the very high methylation rate of the TMPRSS2 gene leads to a very low expression level, while the very low methylation rate of the same gene in PRAD and READ lead to very high numbers of gene transcripts [35]. In terms of different cancer types, the same epigenetic mark can be associated with diverse expression levels. Without incorporation of large-scale wet lab experimentations with such in-silico analyses, a comprehensive picture about the significance of epigenetic changes to link up malignancy and COVID-19 is harder to manifest.

(p61.0) Yao et al. conducted a study to elucidate the regulatory effect of chromosome 3p21.31 (genetic susceptibility locus for COVID-19) [81] in immune cell lines (THP-1, HL-60, Jurkat, and K562 resembling human monocytes, promyelocyte, T lymphocytes, and erythroid respectively) [18]. With CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genomic deletion, CCR9 and SLC6A20 were found to be target genes in the locus. Their investigation revealed six fine-mapped variants (rs34326463, rs76374459, rs73064425, rs13081482, rs35652899, and rs35044562) overlapping human T-cell specific primed enhancers. These findings insinuate of an epigenetic regulatory mechanism that can influence the T cell functions towards SARS-Cov-2 infection [18].

(p61.1) IL-6 can regulate the expression and functions of multiple genes by inhibiting methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3B [19,20]. In inflammation-induced ARDS, [82] IL-6 is activated in dendritic cells by the acetylation of transcription factor KLF4 [83]. A combination of epigenetic phosphorylation and acetylation marks on Herpes virus encoded viral IL-6 can induce STAT3 activity [84]. All these prior studies strengthen the assumption that IL-6 may be epigenetically altered in case of COVID-19 infection. To test such assumption, using Chip-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets from 839 and 157 cell/tissue types of humans and mice through ENCODE respectively (https://www.encodeproject.org/) [85]; Sang et al. discovered significant comparative existence of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac markers between IL-6 and ACE2 gene promoters in various humans and mouse samples.

A diversified global picture ranging from well-advanced vaccination programs for patients with cancer (UK) to countries without any vaccine supplies (Iraq and Guatemala) came into being by the Taskforce's reports. Another mentionable finding is the variability seen among countries on the mass vaccination campaigns in terms of planning, procurement, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Of the 29 countries with access to any type of COVID-19 vaccine, patients with cancer are prioritized only in 9 (26%). Regrettably, with mentionable exception as the VOICE, a multi-center, multi-cohort study based in Netherland which consist of patients with solid malignancies receiving active anticancer treatment who have been vaccinated against COVID-19; very few national systemic data collection from patients with cancer receiving COVID-19 vaccines exist [110]. The inability to access vaccines is the single most cataclysmic obstacle to receive vaccines for many patients with cancer in some of the most vulnerable settings. But lack of proper management and failure in inclusiveness of cancer patients in mass vaccination campaigns are found to exist in well-resourced health systems too.

Nonetheless, the efficacy of the promising mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered enclosed in nano-lipid carriers should be assessed cautiously among solid tumor patients and associated clinical data should be rigorously listed and monitored [120].

(p67.2) A very interesting problem of vaccination can be the EPR [Enhanced Permeation and Retention] effect, a phenomenon where lipid based nanoparticles easily leave the blood flow and reach cancer cells provided that their size is less than 200 nm. Reduced lymphatic drainage also contribute to the accumulation of such nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment after leaking out of the blood vessels [117,118]. Two of the advanced, successful vaccine candidates (Moderna mRNA-1273 and Pfizer BNT162b2) are both delivered enclosed in liposomes (<200 nm particles) which theoretically make them vulnerable to the EPR effect resulting in a possible misplaced accumulation of the target therapeutics in tumor surroundings [98,99]. The possibility of this occurrence taking place in solid tumor patients is a concerning issue regarding COVID-19 vaccination which unfortunately has limited clinical data about active cancer patients; mostly because their lesser participation in the clinical trials. If this EPR effect actually materializes; COVID-19 vaccines, especially the carrier liposomes should be modified. But an assuring fact is that COVID-19 vaccines are administered by the intramuscular (IM) route, and the preclinical data suggest that encapsulated proteins in liposomes administered intramuscularly do not amass at a neoplastic site and systemically is distributed across the body [119].
