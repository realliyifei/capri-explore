## (s3) Crop
Number of References: 2

(p3.0) Residue Process residues, including agro-industrial residues or secondary residues, are created when the plants are processed from the primary resource. Husks, hulls, peels, coir, bagasse, and skins are produced during the processing of the main product. The terms husk, shell, and hull can be used interchangeably [32] or with different meanings [33]. Since there is no standard terminology, all main crop's protective surrounding materials are named husks in this work. Husk material is first produced in the field during the harvest and can also be collected during mechanical cleaning in industrial processing. Different products are obtained during the processing of cereal grain, for instance, husks, flour, and bran.

LLM judge: YES

What are agro-industrial residues, and how are protective materials of main crops, such as husks, produced and collected during processing?

## (s10) Material Processing and Pretreatment
Number of References: 5

(p10.0) In addition to the type of raw materials and manufacturing parameters, the processing and pretreatment affect the properties of the final panel. The raw materials from non-wood lignocellulosic and agricultural sources have been mainly processed mechanically and some were chemically pretreated to create evenly sized particles or to improve their performance in final panels [72,126,139]. The mechanical processing of NWLMs and ARs, such as canola stalks, with a hammermill, has often been used to prepare the raw material [122]. Ndazi et al. [179] produced single-layer particleboards with ground (8 mm sieve) and untreated rice husks and 15% of PF. The results showed that the mechanical properties of the panels decreased by grinding.

LLM judge: NO

The content appears to meet most of the criteria set for suitability, but it fails in a few key areas. 
1. It includes several references within the text ([72,126,139], [122], [179]), suggesting it might not provide comprehensive context without accessing those sources. 
2. The use of abbreviations (e.g., PF) without explanation could confuse readers lacking specific background knowledge. 
3. The text is somewhat fragmented in presenting examples of research and findings, which could hinder its self-contained clarity and understanding.
