## (s11) Symptomatic Relief: Salivary Substitutes
Number of References: 9

(p11.0) The symptomatic relief or control of oral dryness includes hydration (frequent sipping of water), discontinuation or reduction in xerogenic medications, and elimination of common dry mouth offenders, such as tobacco and alcohol [76]. Moreover, artificial salivary substitutes (i.e., commercial products containing specific ingredients, whose properties resemble those of the natural saliva) are frequently used as symptomatic treatments for patients with decreased salivary flow rate [77,78]. In fact, they act as oral lubricants that maintain the lubrication of the mucosa and, hence, relieve the sensation of dryness, without stimulating the salivary flow. However, it should be pointed out that saliva substitutes' action present limited duration and, therefore, a frequent re-application is required, which creates issues around patient adherence and increases the cost of therapy.

(p11.1) An ideal salivary substitute should resemble the properties of human saliva and, simultaneously, provide a pleasant taste aiming to a convenient self-administration and increased patient compliance [79,80]. The development of artificial saliva requires in-depth understanding of both biological and rheological (e.g., viscosity and film-forming wettability) properties of human saliva, which is composed of a mixture of macromolecules. Specifically, human saliva is regarded as a non-Newtonian fluid, because of the salivary glycoproteins' presence. This characterization means, in essence, that saliva's viscosity varies, depending on the shear rate [81]. Thus, the efficacy of artificial saliva as a lubricant is partially dependent on its viscosity and how this changes with shear rates [82]. Since different shear rates may be present in the oral cavity-from 60 to 160 s âˆ’1 during processes such as swallowing and speaking-the high importance of the aforementioned phenomenon is apparently highlighted [83]. So, salivary substitutes are expected to have a viscoelastic pattern similar to normal human saliva in order to provide similar viscosity and film-forming properties. Taking into consideration that the principal aim of saliva substitutes is to ensure the lubrication of oral tissues, it is obvious that apart from the viscosity, lubrication is considered as another important factor for the clinical acceptance of saliva substitutes. Concerning the biological properties of artificial saliva, substances of natural origin, including enzymes such as lysozyme and peroxidase or proteins such as lactoferrin and mucin, may be utilized in order to provide high biocompatibility [84].
