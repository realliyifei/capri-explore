## (s0) Introduction

(p0.0) Dosage disequilibrium introduced by the heteromorphic nature of the X and Y sex chromosomes is compensated by mechanisms that specifically target the X chromosome and modulate its transcriptional competency. The first hint of male/female chromatin difference in mammals was cytological evidence of a nuclear body specific to female somatic cells, referred to as the Barr body [1], and identified as a condensed X chromosome [2]. The formation of this sex chromatin was proposed by Mary Lyon to arise early during development and to result in the transcriptional silencing of one the two Xs, in females only [3]. Balancing X-linked gene products in females through X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is essential for proper development, and failure to do so blocks embryogenesis shortly after implantation [4,5]. In adults, presence of two active X (Xa) chromosomes in somatic cells has been observed mainly in deleterious cell states such as cancer cells [6,7], and loss of X-linked gene dosage compensation is believed to cause aggressive hematological cancers [8].
## (s2) X chromosome inactivation may be altered in pathological contexts

(p2.0) While XCI is extremely stable in normal differentiated cells, abnormal XCI patterns are a hallmark of some pathological contexts, including aging and cancers. For example, female cells without a Barr body have been observed in breast and ovarian tumors [7], and X chromosome aneuploidies were reported in several tumor types [48]. Although genetic instability due to mitotic segregation errors commonly accounts for the loss of the Xi and duplication of the Xa, recent work has identified major epigenomic remodeling of the Xi in some cancer cells associated with abnormal dosage of some X-linked genes ( Fig. 1C) [49]. Impairing Xist expression in the hematopoietic lineage results in the development of aggressive hematological cancers in females only [8], further suggesting that loss of XCI could play a causative role in tumorigenesis. In cancers also, the presence of more than one Xa is linked to the differentiation status of the tumor cells, because the loss of the Xi has been observed in aggressive, poorly differentiated, tumor cells [7,50,51]. The instability of X chromosome activity in cancer cells might be related to the fact that the X chromosome harbors many genes (tumor suppressors, chromatin remodelers) that are related to cancer progression. Abnormal X-linked gene dosage might thus, confer a selective advantage to the cell, a situation that is reminiscent of human pluripotent stem cells in which erosion of XCI spontaneously occurs in culture.

(p2.1) X chromosome activity is thus, connected to the differentiation status of the cell, and only undifferentiated or poorly differentiated cells in physiological, or pathological contexts cope with the presence of two active X chromosomes. A recent study proposed that XCI is required for differentiation to proceed, because double dosage of X-linked genes prevents the cells from exiting pluripotency [52]. This study, conducted in mouse, identified signaling pathways critical for differentiation that are blocked by the presence of two Xa. This would ensure that differentiation would progress only after XCI has been achieved. A tight coordination between dosage compensation and early developmental transition is further secured by direct control of XCI regulators by the pluripotency network. Whether X-linked gene dosage also controls differentiation in human is currently unknown. There is, however, no evidence so far that XCI profiles of female hESCs influence their differentiation potential; cells with eroded XCI, in which X-linked genes reactivation is irreversible [30], appear to differentiate properly. In that case, however, X chromosome dosage compensation might be achieved through a different mechanism, as recently reported in human preimplantation embryos [53].
## (s5) Heterochromatin signature of the Xi varies across cellular states

(p5.0) Pioneer immunofluorescence (IF) studies on human metaphase chromosomes have defined two major subtypes of facultative heterochromatin on the human Xi: one resembling constitutive heterochromatin, characterized by H3K9me3, HP1 [105][106][107][108], and H4K20me3 enrichment [105] and a second distinguished by H3K27me3, macroH2A, and XIST RNA accumulation [105]. These signatures were shown to be mutually exclusive, each being associated with different cytogenetic bands on the Xi in hTERT-RPE1 cells [105]. Further analysis of these epigenomic marks on metaphase spreads from additional cell lines; however, highlighted a variability in this organization, with substantial cell-to-cell, and line-toline differences in H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 distribution on the Xi [109]. The banding pattern of H3K27me3 appears to be a consistent feature of all cell lines examined; however, only one region, Xq22-23, remained commonly enriched in H3K27me3 in all cells and across all cell lines. In contrast, H3K9me3 was rather found restricted to Xi centromeres and telomeres. Although confined to the organization of metaphase chromosomes, these initial observations already suggested the existence of an epigenetic plasticity of the Xi in somatic cells, and implied that the X chromosome inactive state might not be propagated with a single epigenetic signature.
