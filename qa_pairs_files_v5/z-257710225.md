## (s6) Driving Force of Elastic Recoil
Number of References: 3

(p6.0) To understand the origin of the mechanical efficiency of tissues both in a healthy and diseased or/and aging organism, we must remember that the basis for elasticity and resilience of tissues is an exceptional capability of cross-linked elastin fibers to extreme deformation under small loads and next spontaneous recoil back to the original shape with minimal energy loss. In all materials, also in living tissues, elastic recoil after deformation results from the sum of two different physical driving forces. One of them appears as a reaction to internal energy changes when the applied deforming force distorts the molecular structure of the material and results from the tendency of each molecular system to a spontaneous regain of the state of the lowest potential energy. The other one results from a thermodynamic principle stating that isolated systems spontaneously arrive at a state where entropy is the highest in given circumstances. The first process dominates in stiff materials with ordered molecular structure, while the other one is in elastomers, elastically deformable polymers characterized by a high degree of conformational disorder which makes the elastomers in a relaxed state have high entropy [6,96]. There are two essential molecular attributes of material with entropic elasticity: flexible polymer chains and the presence of cross-links between them. Elastin structure is characterized by a high degree of conformational disorder, which makes it flexible and easily stretched, and by a high degree of cross-linking, resulting in a network capable of distributing the deformation-related stresses and strains throughout the polymer. The entropic component of elastin elasticity is more than 70% [96]. Thus a passive, entropy-driven mechanism allowing the recoil of elastic fibers after stretching endows the extracellular matrix of connective tissues with their elasticity and resilience.
