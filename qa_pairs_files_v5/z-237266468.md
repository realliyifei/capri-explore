## (s4) Software Supply-Chain Attacks
Number of References: 2

(p4.0) The goal of supply-chain attacks is to inject malicious code into software or library externally. These attacks modify the targeted program so that it is still validly signed by its owner. The attacker simply injects his code into one of the software's dependencies [21]. Theoretically, an attacker can do this injection in any given node in the software's dependency tree. The ultimate goal is to alter the behavior of the root or a specific node, which is the targeted software product, using a child node, which in this case is a dependency node in the tree [21].
## (s6) Machine Learning

(p6.0) Learning is considered the hallmark of human intelligence, and researchers have worked on making machines intelligent, giving birth to ML [36]. It is the study of methods to allow computers to gain new knowledge and constantly improve themselves [36]. The definition can also be the process that allows computers to convert data to knowledge through certain techniques [36]. The applications of the ML techniques have been quite popular in recent years, and one of these applications is the area of information security. We will incorporate some ML techniques into our proposed security remedies to provide a more reliable method of identifying and preventing malicious actors.
## (s10) Technical Lag
Number of References: 14

(p10.0) Packages relying on vulnerable libraries is not the only issue, as Gonzalez-Barahona et al. introduced the concept of technical lag, which is "the increasing lag between upstream development and the deployed system if no corrective actions are taken" [14,40]. It is essentially the phenomenon where a package lags behind its most recent release [6]. Code reuse only seems to be contributing to the issue as most recent packages can still be outdated if they rely on unpatched components [40].

(p10.1) One may reasonably want the package updates to be automated to solve the issue. Package updates may introduce incompatibility issues with the existing project [40]. Developers should not ignore patches as well due to known vulnerabilities. Patches also introduce new functionalities that a project misses by avoiding incompatibility risks, causing a concept named "technical debt" to arise [14]. However, the issue mainly seems to be a trade-off between security and functionality.

(p10.2) The perspective against technical lag also seems to vary as the literature contains data implying that clients can be safe from technical lag. It has been concluded that one in four dependencies and two in five releases suffer technical lag in the npm environment [6]. After 2015, it has also been observed that the average duration of technical lag in npm was 7 to 9 months, meaning that a specific dependency would be updated 7 to 9 months after a library's new release [6].

(p10.3) Furthermore, benign users might not be the ones to discover a vulnerability first. Most vulnerabilities take a long time to be discovered, especially lowseverity ones [7]. Although project contributors fix most vulnerabilities discovered in the source code in a short amount of time, a non-negligent portion takes longer [7].

(p10.4) To counter the dangers of the technical lag argument, we found one report stating that 73.3% of outdated clients were safe from threats as these clients did not use the specific vulnerable code [38]. A vulnerability tends to be in a specific function, and not every client will have to use that particular function. However, the risk of a client using the vulnerable function persists. Developers who realize the functions they are using are not particularly affected by the stated issue take longer to update their dependencies, increasing the technical lag [38].

(p10.5) In addition, One may reasonably conclude that the older the package is, the less vulnerability it will have. Thus, a possible solution may be to use old packages. However, a study in the literature has found that this claim is wrong as they found that most vulnerabilities are in packages older than 28 months [7]. Older packages tend to have more severe vulnerabilities [7]. We could not establish a relationship between security and the package's age in this study.
## (s11) Squatting Attacks
Number of References: 3

(p11.0) We found that attackers mainly use two methods to spread malicious code in these environments: stealing the credentials of accounts that maintain certain packages to inject their code into the project and tricking users into downloading their packages by methods such as squatting attacks [35]. The term squatting attack is an umbrella concept used in this paper to represent typosquatting and combosquatting. We will discuss other types of attack methods against the public registries in this paper, but we focus on these two scenarios in this section. In the first scenario, the "ssh-decorate" package was affected as the attackers took control of the maintainer account and injected code into the package. The injected code would send users' ssh credentials to an attacker-controlled remote server [35]. Some popular maintainers can contribute to hundreds of packages, making their accounts critical to a potential compromise [41].
## (s14) Trivial Packages or Micropackages
Number of References: 19

(p14.0) Trivial packages are small libraries, which a study in the literature found to be less than 35 lines of code, according to 79% of their participants who attempted to classify libraries as trivial [2]. Developers have considered trivial packages good until recent trends pushed code reuse to an extreme [2]. The breakdown of popular web services, such as Facebook, Airbnb, and Netflix in 2016 from a Node.js 11-line trivial package named left-pad, only made the concept be questioned further [1,5].

(p14.1) The incident has been referred to as the case that "almost broke the Internet," which led to many discussions over code reuse sparked by David Haney's blog post "Have We Forgotten How to Program?" [1]. Node.js used to allow developers to unpublish projects that lead to the left-pad incident emerge [1]. Although the origin of the incident is not related to a vulnerability in the package itself, it has raised awareness about trivial packages [1]. Numerous developers agreed with Haney's opinion that developers should implement trivial tasks themselves rather than adding an extra dependency to the project [1]. Since then, people have been working to investigate this issue.

(p14.2) A study has researched the developers' perspectives of trivial packages or micropackages, and the interviewed developers stated that their definition of micropackage is the same across PyPi and npm [2]. It has been found that 16% of packages in the npm and 10.5% of packages in PyPi are trivial packages [2]. The same study also questioned developers to understand the reasons for using such packages. It has been found that developers use these packages due to their belief that the packages are well tested and maintained [2]. Developers stated that they use these packages to increase their productivity [1]. The surveyed software developers also stated that they use trivial packages as they do not want to be concerned with extra indirect dependencies. However, it has also been found that trivial packages do use dependencies in some cases [2]. A study has found that 43.7% of trivial packages have at least one dependency, and 11.5% have more than 20 dependencies [1]. The surveyed developers also thought that trivial packages create a dependency mess, which is hard to update and maintain [1]. The perspective against trivial packages seems to be controversial, as it has been found that 23.9% of the JavaScript developers consider them bad. In comparison, 57.9% of the developers do not consider them to be a bad practice [1]. 70.3% of the Python developers consider trivial packages as bad practice [2].

(p14.3) Zimmermann's paper coins this issue as "micropackages" instead of using the term "trivial package." Still, the concepts are the same: packages with fewer lines of source code than a threshold, although this threshold seems ambiguous across the literature [41]. The specific study explicitly stated that micropackages are insecure as it increases the attack surface and the number of dependencies a project has [41].
## (s15) PyPi Overview
Number of References: 4

(p15.0) PyPi has limited automated review tools for the uploading process as the npm environment does, making it vulnerable to different kinds of attacks, such as squatting [35]. Furthermore, the moderator and administrator team, who has permission to remove packages from the registry, seems to be less than ten people, limiting the maximum number of code reviews they can conduct [35]. Considering the 400K package owner, each administrator seems to be responsible for 40K people, assuming every administrator performs code review for malicious content, thus providing a lower bound for the number of package owners per moderator ratio. PyPi allows end-users to report malicious packages. Nevertheless, considering each moderator being responsible for at least 40K developers, it would be only reasonable to question the efficiency of the code reviews. When users download packages using the pip, there is no available system that reviews the code to determine its safety aside from a user's antivirus. So, we can outline the process of publishing packages with figure 7 that illustrates a high-level view of the schematics of the PyPi ecosystem. Fig. 7: An overview of the roles in the PyPi ecosystem [35] Spreading malicious code in the wild PyPi is fairly similar to the process we illustrated in the npm environment. Mainly, an attacker can either steal the credentials of an existing account to exploit the current reputation of the project or create a new package by forking the targeted package and modifying the content, or simply creating a brand new package [35]. The latter method can still trick users into downloading the attacker's library by a squatting method.
