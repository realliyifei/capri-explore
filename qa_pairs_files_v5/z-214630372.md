## (s1) RAGE
Number of References: 8

(p1.0) RAGE, a multiligand receptor, belongs to the immunoglobulin receptor superfamily that plays a critical role in innate immune response regulation [14]. It is a 50 kDa protein consisting of an extracellular N-terminal V-type (variable) and two C-type (constant) domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The receptor ligand-binding portion is the extracellular V-type domain, while the cytoplasmic tail is necessary for signal transduction as well as adaptor protein association. RAGE has been identified in two extracellular secreted forms: an endogenous secretory (es) form and a soluble (s) form [15]. Even if the sRAGE isoforms are missing transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, they maintain their ligand-binding ability, acting as decoy receptors and inhibiting the binding between RAGE with their ligands or with other receptors [16]; consequently, sRAGE treatment causes a downregulation of RAGE signaling, thus decreasing inflammation [17].

(p1.1) Nevertheless, sRAGE administration can cause a stimulation of signal transduction, thus inducing an inflammatory response [18]. The diagnostic role of sRAGE as a biomarker has been debated due to conflicting results. A correlation between circulating sRAGE levels and osteoporosis has been described [19], but low serum esRAGE levels may also be indicative of high bone resorption and vertebral fracture risk [20] because of the lack of inhibitory sRAGE decoy effects. It has been proposed that increased levels of circulating AGE and esRAGE are related to an increase in bone turnover and hip fracture frequency in elderly men, correlating with osteopenia and osteoporosis [21]. sRAGE levels are also negatively correlated to BMI and leptin level, suggesting sRAGE as a good biomarker of lipid metabolism and bone fragility.
## (s4) S100 Calgranulin Proteins
Number of References: 19

(p4.0) The S100 proteins are small molecules (10-12 kD) belonging to a highly conserved family of proteins consisting of 24 members distinguished by their different functions. It has been proposed that some of them exert intracellular regulatory effects, others possess both intracellular and extracellular functions, and others mainly have extracellular regulatory effects [64]. The involvement of S100 proteins in the regulation of differentiation, energy metabolism, proliferation, inflammation, apoptosis, migration/invasion, and Ca 2+ homeostasis processes has been proposed. This action has been correlated to interactions with several targets such as receptors, cytoskeletal subunits, enzymes, transcription factors, and nucleic acids. The ability of S100 proteins to control cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and survival in normal or pathological conditions, or in tissue repair has been proposed [64]. S100 proteins are linked to several human pathologies, such as cancer [58,65], neurodegenerative diseases [66,67], autoimmune diseases, and arthritis [68]. Moreover, a role of S100 protein in the cartilage repair process and osteoarthritis has been proposed [64,69,70]. S100 proteins are released by leukocytes during inflammation, and they act through RAGE (S100A12 and S100B) and/or TLR4 (S100A8, S100A9), requiring Ca2+ [71,72]. S100 family members can activate or inhibit receptors in a tissue-and context-specific manner. It has been proposed that RAGE-S100 protein signaling can promote the release of cytokines in endothelial cells and leukocytes through stimulation of NF-kB, thus causing a proinflammatory condition and contributing to inflammation-related diseases [73]. S100 proteins regulate skeletal metabolism in bone via direct and indirect action on bone cells [65,74].

(p4.1) It has been proposed that extracellular S100A4 can inhibit by NF-ÎºB activation, osteoblasts mineralization function causing an imbalance in bone homeostasis by inhibiting new bone formation [66,75].

(p4.2) Further, S100A8 activates osteoclasts by interacting with the toll-like receptor 4 mediating osteoclastic bone destruction in experimental arthritis [76], and it has been proposed that S100A9 treatment in osteoblasts stimulates RAGE expression and promotes cytokine release. Additionally, S100A9-treated osteoblast CM increased osteoclast differentiation/activity, whereas directly in osteoclasts S100A9 inhibited osteoclastogenesis [77].
