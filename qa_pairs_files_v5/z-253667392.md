## (s0) Introduction

(p0.0) Innervation regulates craniofacial development and homeostasis while being reciprocally affected by target tissues. For example, the absence of innervation causes target organ deformation, as in individuals with Moebius syndrome, a disease caused by the absence or underdevelopment of VI and VII cranial nerves, a series of craniofacial deformations is present [1]. Rabbit submandibular glands undergo atrophy upon denervation, which can be reversed by redistribution of autonomic nerves [2].

(p0.1) The tooth-periodontium complex, including teeth, gingiva, periodontal ligament (PDL), and alveolar bone, is one of the densely innervated cranial structures containing trigeminal sensory nerves and autonomic nerves. An array of evidence has demonstrated the mutual regulation of tooth and dental nerves in development [3]. The mutual regulation also exists in tooth and periodontal homeostasis. For instance, innervation orchestrates inflammation [4], promotes periodontal healing [5], and regulates the physiological reparation and regeneration of dental tissue [6]. These interactions in development and diseases are mediated by a variety of nerve-or tooth-derived molecules and will probably inspire advances in tooth regeneration.

(p0.2) Currently, researchers have employed various strategies for tooth regeneration using fetal tissue [7,8] and tooth germ cells [9] or using adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [10]. They imitate tooth development and physiological reparation, respectively. However, the innervation of bio-engineered teeth does not fully replicate the highly asymmetric and organized pattern of the natural tooth-periodontium complex [7]. Better restoring tooth innervation requires deeper understanding of the mutual regulation between tooth and dental nerves in development and homeostasis. Understanding this will also benefit dental tissue engineering, as some neurogenic molecules are effective in promoting dental tissue formation [11]. In recent years, extensive studies have suggested the significance of local sensory and sympathetic nerves in maintaining dental and periodontal health and promoting the recovery of local diseases. This not only is because of their anatomical localization but also is demonstrated through inferior alveolar nerve resection (IANr), which not only reduces incisor dentin/enamel formation and injury repair, but also suppresses alveolar bone remodeling and periodontal defect repair [12][13][14]. In addition, sympathetic innervation also appears to take a regulatory role in osteoclast infiltration in rat periapical lesions [15], and alveolar bone remodeling in oral challenge with P. gingivalis [16]. Reversely, carotid sinus nerve stimulation plays a protective role in rat periodontitis, attenuating alveolar bone loss and inflammation [17]. Altogether, these studies agree that normal sensory and sympathetic innervation are critical for tooth-periodontium complex.
## (s2) Neurotrophins
Number of References: 2

(p2.0) Neurotrophins are identified as a family of growth factors important for neuronal survival, development, and function, as well as for the immune and reproductive systems. NGF as a prototypic neurotrophin is a significant target-derived promotive factor for peripheral sensory and sympathetic innervation. NGF immunoreactivity is mainly located in the dental mesenchyme in the bud stage, while in the cap and bell stages, it is mainly expressed in the dental epithelium and adjacent odontoblast layer. Its gene expression pattern correlates with pulpal neurite growth in postnatal mouse molars, suggesting that NGF is involved in the local sprouting, guidance, and arrangement of trigeminal axons in developing teeth [26]. This can explain why neonatal exposure to anti-NGF reduces the number of trigeminal neurons projecting to rat molar dental pulp [27].
## (s10) Morphological Changes in Local Dental Nerves
Number of References: 7

(p10.0) Myelinated nerves in the apical pulp of human teeth with irreversible pulpitis undergo various kinds of degenerative changes. The sprouting and degeneration of nerves are initial events occurring in carious or pulpitis teeth, and the exact mechanisms are still under investigation. However, the nerves do not just passively wait to be damaged by inflammation. In carious teeth, overexpression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a protein that promotes extensive sprouting of nerve endings into the reparative dentin matrix, is observed [75]. As shown in Figure 2, caries-induced pulp inflammation activates the complement system resulting in the production of C5a [76]. In addition, all pulp fibroblasts beneath the carious site express the C5a receptor (C5aR), which activates the production of BDNF upon binding to C5a. In turn, BDNF guides the outgrowing neurites towards the carious site [76]. However, C5a/C5aR binding seems to downregulate pulp fibroblasts' production of NGF, another neurite outgrowth inducer that mainly promotes neurite length rather than quantity. Nevertheless, pulp fibroblasts' C5aR activation is still essential for augmented neurite outgrowth in carious conditions [77]. Contrastingly, DPSCs are shown to overexpress both BDNF and NGF in response to C5a [78]. The NGF overexpression is shown to increase nerve density, which will subside once healing occurs but continue if inflammation persists, suggesting neural regulation in dental disease progression [79]. NGF is also shown to elicit the neuronal differentiation of DPSCs, which might also contribute to the regeneration of injured nerve fibers [80]. These simultaneous actions of immune, pulp, and neural cells suggest a coordinated neuroimmune response in host defense and healing. Accordingly, molecules mentioned here may be applied to better regenerate pulp innervation.
## (s11) Molecular Changes in Neural Cells
Number of References: 6

(p11.0) Molecular changes in dental innervation are also observed in various aspects. Voltagegated sodium channels (NaVs) are transmembrane ion channels on sensory neurons whose expression is altered in caries and pulpitis. In particular, NaV1.7, NaV1.8, and NaV1.9 are associated with aggravated pain or inflammation [81,82]. In contrast, Kv1.4, a voltage-gated potassium channel suppressing the generation of action potential, is downregulated on sensory neurons during pulpitis [83]. In addition, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), nonselective cation channels on sensory nerves, activated by inflammatory agents or bacterial products are also involved in the generation of pain in pulpitis, as their activation causes the release of CGRP, a pain mediator [84,85]. Interestingly, in spite of local neural changes, distant neurons in the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion of inflamed pulp also display pathological changes [86].

Interestingly, in spite of local neural changes, distant neurons in the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion of inflamed pulp also display pathological changes [86].

(p12.1) Neurosecretion also changes in pathological conditions. A variety of neuropeptides, including neurokinin A, substance P (SP), NPY, and CGRP, are shown to be upregulated in the pulp in conditions of caries, pulpitis, or occlusal trauma [87][88][89]. These neuropeptides still have other physiological functions contributing to the regulation of tooth and periodontal homeostasis, which reflect the mutual regulation between nerves and target oral tissues ( Figure 2) and will be described in detail in Section 6.

## (s15) SP
Number of References: 14

(p15.0) SP is an 11 amino acid neuropeptide, a well-known member of the tachykinin family, produced by a variety of cells including sensory neurons, macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, and lymphocytes [91]. The production of SP is upregulated in many pathological conditions and dental treatments. There is evidence in orthodontic movement showing an increase in SP resulting from the NGF/TrkA-PDL-associated sensory neuron body [88,92].

(p15.1) Dental pulp fibroblasts express both SP and its receptor, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1), and SP expression is significantly upregulated in carious teeth and irreversible pulpitis [87,93], suggesting its regulation in pulpal neurogenic inflammation, and it acts at least in part in an autocrine fashion [93]. Mechanistically, SP induces IL-8 and MIP-1 production in dental pulp [94,95] and TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-2, and IL-6 production in rat cutaneous wounds [95] and therefore is involved in the orchestration of pulpal inflammatory response. SP/NK-1 signaling is also significant in pulpal pain generation [96], as SP is a pain mediator, and NK-1 expression in inflamed dental pulp is tightly correlated with the degree of pain. Furthermore, SP is a vasodilator in pulp, activating NO synthase for NO production from vascular endothelial cells [97]. It also increases blood flow via the release of histamine [98]. This partially accounts for the hyperemia observed in inflamed pulp.

(p15.2) In the periodontium, SP is conducive to gingival inflammation and periodontal bone destruction. SP in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is reduced as the periodontal inflammation is relieved [99], meaning SP may be used as a predictor for disease progression. SP also promotes osteoclast differentiation by upregulating the RANKL/OPG ratio in gingival fibroblasts, and it upregulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in macrophages and gingival fibroblasts, leading to inflammation and angiogenesis [100]. These findings together reveal SP's action in periodontitis.
## (s16) VIP
Number of References: 6

(p16.0) VIP is a potent anti-inflammatory parasympathetic neuropeptide distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems (PNSs). The biological actions of VIP are mediated by two high-affinity receptor subtypes, VPAC1 and VPAC2, on target cell membranes. VIP and VPAC1 expressions are elevated in moderately carious teeth to protect the pulp [101]. In periapical granulomas, VIP is a therapeutic target whose expression is associated positively with immunoregulatory factors and inversely with proinflammatory mediators [102]. The similar functions of VIP are also shown to alleviate inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis through regulating immune responses via monocyte differentiation, Treg migration, or TNF-α production and in osteoclastogenic response via the RANKL/OPG ratio [102][103][104][105]. These data suggest VIP may help eliminate local inflammation to create better conditions for tooth and periodontium regeneration.
## (s17) ACh and Cholinergic System
Number of References: 5

(p17.0) The cholinergic system, including ACh, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), is involved in periodontal disease. Ach, an important neurotransmitter, is mainly expressed by the vagus nerve. Although little evidence shows that the vagus nerve directly affects the periodontium, the components of a functional non-neuronal cholinergic system have been found in oral mucosa [106]. ACh can modulate innate immune responses within the oral mucosa in both an autocrine and a paracrine manner and subsequently participate in the pathological process of periodontal disease [107]. A clinical study showed that the Ach level increases significantly in saliva and GCF with higher levels of IL-17A and IL-17F, which are correlated positively with the severity of periodontal diseases [108], meaning the nonneuronal cholinergic system may influence the etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease.

(p17.1) Nicotine also plays an important role in periodontal diseases. The use of tobacco products is closely associated with an increased incidence of periodontal disease and unsatisfactory periodontal treatment. It is well established that a variety of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) and rat periodontal tissues. Nicotine activation of nAChRs induces IL-8 release as the gingival epithelial innate immune response [109]. Recently, nicotine/α7 nAChR signaling has been shown to regulate autophagy of hPDLCs, and subsequently promote the release of inflammatory factors including IL-1β and IL-8 [110]. These findings, therefore, suggest a direct proinflammatory action of nicotine/nAChR on the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Intercepting nicotine/nAChR signals with topical drug delivery may improve the periodontal regeneration outcome of conventional periodontal treatment.
## (s20) CGRP
Number of References: 12

(p20.0) CGRP is a neuropeptide associated with neurogenic inflammation and painful orofacial conditions. During pulpitis, the expression levels of CGRP and CGRP receptors are upregulated, relating to dental pain and other histopathological phenomena [121]. CGRP receptors are expressed on a large portion of M2 macrophages in irreversible pulpitis or healthy pulp, indicating the immunomodulatory function of CGRP [122]. Consistently, LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), a pathogen commonly associated with symptomatic pulpitis, can directly excite trigeminal ganglion neurons via transient receptor potentials (TRPs) sensitized by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), resulting in CGRP production [123]. Axonal CGRP is commonly elevated in peripheral nerve injury and is involved in the regeneration of local nerve fibers by promoting Schwann cell proliferation, meaning the increased CGRP production might also promote pulpal nerve regeneration in pulpitis, where pulpal nerves are damaged by inflammation and bacterial products [124]. In addition, in vitro studies reveal it antagonistically but coordinately regulates the formation of reparative dentin with Shh, as they are secreted from sensory afferents in combination upon stimuli [125]. However, CGRP regulation is variable across individuals, explaining the variable levels of pain and disease severity among patients with caries or pulpitis [89]. In apical periodontitis, capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibers exert a protective effect against the progression of periodontal lesions, possibly relating to the release of CGRP and other neuropeptides [126]. Overall, CGRP holds the potential for tooth regeneration, but its efficacy may depend on individuals.

(p20.1) CGRP protects against the progression of periodontitis. Most neurons in TG that innervate the rat gingival mucosa contain CGRP and SP. CGRP inhibits the apoptosis of osteoblasts induced by LPS [127] and inhibits osteoclastogenesis in vitro, both contributing to the alleviation of bone loss [128]. However, CGRP content is significantly reduced in GCF in the inflamed periodontium, where the defense and regenerative capacity is debilitated [129]. Supplementing CGRP may help recover this regenerative capacity. CGRP regulation is also implicated in other periodontal conditions, such as in occlusal trauma combined with moderate orthodontic forces [88], and the mutual interaction of CGRP and Shh promotes socket healing after tooth extraction [130]. In summary, CGRP has a substantial influence on various periodontal conditions that may be helpful in regenerative therapy.
