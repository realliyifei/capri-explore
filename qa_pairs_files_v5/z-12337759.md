(p13.0) Prognostic evaluation of idiopathic dilatation of pulmonary artery is limited by the number of clinically studied cases and lack of adequate follow up but it is believed to be a benign anomaly. Most of the reported cases have survived into sixth or seventh decade. The increase in size of the main pulmonary artery can be progressive. The appearance of exertional dyspnea and a restrictive impairment of ventilatory capacity may be due to left ventricular strain and space-occupying compressive effect of the expanding pulmonary arteries. Periodical follow up is advisable to check for formation of aneurysm or regurgitation. Fang and Tsai suggested that prognosis of IDPA is better than other causes of pulmonary artery dilatation. 31 Ring et al., 32 stressed upon the fact that a long period of observation should be considered to be a further criterion for diagnosis, as in some patients who appear to have this condition, an underlying pathology will become apparent.
