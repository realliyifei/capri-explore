(p8.0) Our initial database search yielded 420 citations. A review of titles and abstracts excluded 405 citations that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. Fifteen publications were extracted for full review. Nine articles contained relevant information and were included in the final evaluation. Eight studies described transition from parenteral to oral therapies (14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)23), and two described transition to subcutaneous therapies (25,26) (Table 3). A 10th study (24) revisited outcomes from a subset of patients in one of the original studies (18) but was not included in the analysis (Table 3 legend).

(p8.1) Reasons for transition to oral agents included sepsis, line infections (14,15,26), side effects of epoprostenol (14,17), difficult venous access (15) and patient preference (14,16,18). For transition from subcutaneous treprostinil, injection site pain was also cited (14,23). Time for transition from parenteral to oral agents ranged from four weeks (23) to one year (16).
