## (s0) Introduction
Number of References: 5

(p0.0) Solanum lyratum Thunb. is a herbaceous vine of the family Solanaceae, with white villous hairs on violinshaped leaves and stems, distributed throughout China, Japan, Korea, etc. [1]. S. lyratum prefers a warm and humid environment and is distributed widely in valley grass, roadside and field. S. lyratum is commonly known as "Bai-Mao-Teng" in traditional Chinese medicine and "Back-Mo-Deung" in traditional Korean medicine [2]. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), S. lyratum has the functions of clearing heat and removing toxicity ("Qingre Jiedu" in Chinese), dispelling wind and eliminating dampness ("Qufeng Lishi" in Chinese). Therefore, S. lyratum has been traditionally prescribed mainly for healing jaundice, edema, gonorrhea, cholecystitis, phlogosis, and rheumatoid arthritis [3]. Modern phytochemistry and pharmacological studies revealed that S. lyratum consists of a variety of active ingredients, including steroidal saponins, steroidal alkaloids, terpenoids, lignans, and flavonoids [4]. And steroidal saponins and steroidal alkaloids have been used in the modern clinic to treat various cancers, especially lung cancer, cervical cancer, and liver cancer [3].

(p22.0) Modern pharmacological studies have revealed that cancer or other diseases are primarily associated with the production and accumulation of excessive free radicals [87], which are commonly produced by the continuous contact between our body and the outside world. Thus, antioxidants can effectively relieve the harmful effects of free radicals. It has been confirmed that S. lyratum extracts and compounds possess significant antioxidant activities. 50% Ethanol extract of S. lyratum (10 μg/mL) could protect against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL)-induced injury in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by direct antioxidative action [88]. In the DPPH radical-scavenging tests in vitro using the spectrophotometric method with vitamin C as the positive control, the ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts from S. lyratum showed antioxidative potential with IC 50 of 0.230 mg/mL and 1.010 mg/mL, respectively [89]. Five flavones 236, 248, 249, 251, and 258 from the ethanol extracts of S. lyratum possessed the capability of scavenging DPPH free radicals with IC 50 values of 2.56-21.33 μg/mL [70]. It seems that the glycosidation of the flavone C-3 and C-5 is essential for the scavenging of DPPH free radicals.
## (s28) Toxicology

(p28.0) Up to now, the toxicity studies of the isolated compounds and extracts of S. lyratum may have been overlooked by researchers, while few studies have found the toxic potential of Solanum glycoalkaloid [125]. The toxic properties of Glycoalkaloids including solamargine (8) have been reviewed by Sinani AI S.S.S. et al. are due to (1) their ability to disrupt cell-membrane function by complexation with membrane 3β-hydroxysterols to form aggregates and damage the membrane integrity [126], (2) their anti-acetylcholinesterase activity on the central nervous system [126,127], and (3) changes caused by them in active transport of ions through membranes, resulting in disorders in general body metabolism [126]. Additionally, in the acute toxicity experiment with rats, neither mortality nor clinical alterations were shown, except for the mild transient diarrhea with 70% ethanol extract of S. lyratum at 5000 mg/kg [31]. In future, more pharmacological evidences should be sought on the possible adverse effects and the toxicities of S. lyratum extracts and their bioactive constituents when
