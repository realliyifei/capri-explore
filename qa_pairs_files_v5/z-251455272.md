Number of References: 15

(p13.0) As mentioned in the previous section, company strategy is one of the key factors that influences IFDI investment in the host country as well as OFDI from the home country.Table 6 presents eight studies that focus on the company location decision strategy to engage in foreign investment (Barnard 2008;Erdilek 2008;Filippov 2010;Galan et al. 2007;Ramírez-Alesón and Fleta-Asín 2016;Sim 2006;Sim and Pandian 2007;Yeoh 2011).

(p13.1) These studies identify influential factors that companies consider in the location decision process of foreign investment by MNCs from developed and developing countries.In the case of developed countries, managers consider strategic asset-investment factors as their motivation to engage in OFDI in European Union countries (Galan et al. 2007).They also consider cultural distance, historical respect, and social factors as the main determinants of investment in Latin American countries (Galan et al. 2007).Meanwhile, in the case of developing countries, the characteristics of the location choices for OFDI are: the size of MNCs and their focus on globalisation, provision of markets and competitive cost, and the advantages and disadvantages of their proposed strategies (i.e., adaptation to markets and relative cost of investment, entry mode strategy e.g., joint venture, and cultural and historical distance) (Sim 2006).The internationalisation strategies considered by firms in the case of TWMNCs are as follows: (a) In the case of Malaysian and Taiwanese companies, the drivers and motivations for OFDI are competitive cost and other L-advantages that are supported by the aspects of ethnic distance (Sim and Pandian 2007); (b) In the case of Turkish MNCs, the drivers and motivations for OFDI are liberalisation in both the home country's regulations in relation to its investment climate to push OFDI, and the host country's regulations to pull OFDI in terms of fiscal benefits, and access to natural resources, markets, technologies, and brands (Erdilek 2008); (c) MNCs with established O-advantages in the home country tend to seek investment in low-to-medium research industries (Barnard 2008); (d) In the case of Russian MNCs, the motives and drivers for OFDI are resourceseeking investments to acquire the host country's resources, market-seeking investments for entering new markets or developing existing markets, and efficiency-seeking investments to increase MNCs' efficiency by taking advantage of the host country's economies of scale (Filippov 2010); (e) In the case of Indian pharmaceutical companies, the motives and drivers for OFDI are to absorb and to acquire knowledge from the potential host country locations for OFDI, i.e., economic conditions, institutional factors related to knowledge association, and social networks (Yeoh 2011).
