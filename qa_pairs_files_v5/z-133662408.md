(p0.0) It has been known since the era of the Earth Radiation Budget Satellites in the 1980s [1] that clouds tend to cool the Earth by approximately 20 W m −2 . In other words, the cloud radiative effect or forcing is R cld = R − R 0 ≈ − 20 W m −2 where R is the temporally and globally averaged net radiation at the top of the atmosphere and superscript 0 denotes clear sky. This tendency to cool the Earth system is about five times the magnitude and of opposite sign to the external radiative perturbation (dR ext ) due to a doubling of CO 2 . Assuming that the climate system is represented by changes to the globally averaged surface temperature (δT sfc ), the change in top of atmosphere net radiative flux (dR), associated with changes in the climate system, is defined as a feedback [λ, W m −2 K −1 ]. A thorough discussion of the primary feedbacks in the climate system is given in [2], and a review of cloud feedbacks (λ cld ) is given in [3]. Uncertainty in the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) defined as δT sfc due to CO 2 doubling has been persistently large due primarily to uncertainties in λ cld [4,5].
