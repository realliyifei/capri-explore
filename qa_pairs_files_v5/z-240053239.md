(p14.0) Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties and plays a crucial role in immunity [199][200][201]. Li et al. [202,203] presented that 1,25(OH) 2 D3, the active form of vitamin D, also called calcitriol, was a negative regulator of RAS and inhibited renin synthesis. Xu et al. [204] confirmed that vitamin D could block ACE and Ang II expression and the increase of the ACE2 level in LPS-induced ALI. Mendonca et al. [205] found that activation of Nrf2 by vitamin D could reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, enhance innate immunity, and downregulate ACE2 to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
