(p3.0) Adherence to a variety of health behaviors is an integral part of successful long-term asthma management, which frequently requires adherence to daily medication. Nonetheless, adherence rates to asthma medications are often found to be very poor [40]. Depending on children's ages, asthma management can involve considerable involvement on the part of other family members, who help oversee daily behaviors such as proper medication adherence. In addition, certain health behaviors youth may engage in, for example smoking, can have especially detrimental consequences among youth with asthma [41,42] who are frequently found to be more likely to smoke compared to their healthy peers [43,44].

(p3.1) Again, maltreated youth may lack caregivers who can support successful disease management. They may reside in single-parent households where caregivers are overburdened, juggling multiple responsibilities, and financially stretched [45,46], and as a result, unable to seek appropriate medical care, pay for prescribed treatments, and facilitate children's medication adherence [38]. Parents of children with maltreatment histories are also more likely to be struggling with mental health and substance abuse problems themselves [47][48][49], both of which may further signal an inability on the part of parents to be actively involved in their children's disease management process.

(p3.2) Youth's own behaviors may also contribute to worse asthma outcomes. Several studies have linked experiences of child maltreatment to greater smoking rates and more persistent smoking [19,50]. This has the potential to negatively affect both the onset of asthma as well as exaggerate existing asthma [51]. A history of child maltreatment has also been associated with increased obesity rates among children and adolescents [17]. This is of interest as obesity is increasingly being identified as a risk factor for pediatric asthma, especially nonatopic asthma, even though the underlying causes are not yet clearly understood [22,52]. Consequently, obesity following child maltreatment may represent another pathway to increased asthma risk. So might other health practices, including drug use, sleep habits, or dietary intake, but these pathways require further investigation.
