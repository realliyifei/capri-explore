(p19.0) The health workforce available to provide services can be increased by engaging the private sector. This was described in two case studies. Dreesch et al. [23] showed that in Botswana comprehensive partnerships across the board greatly improved the effectiveness of service delivery. Partnerships with the private sector, and the mechanisms that allow it, were key, maximizing use of the available human resources for health in the country for the treatment of and attention to HIV/AIDS. In Tanzania, there is a potential of a similar private sector partnership in contributing to the MDG target of increasing skilled attendance at delivery by allowing 'retired' midwifery workforce in Tanzania to open private practices in rural areas [30].
