## (s1) Machine learning models' biases and fairness
Number of References: 8

(p1.0) By and large, a procedure or judgment is deemed to be fair if it does not discriminate against individuals on the basis of their inclusion in a protected group, such as gender or race. Discrimination is the product of bias. Bias is a deliberate departure from an objective reality. A statistical estimator is biased when it encounters a systemic error that prevents it from convergeing to the true value it is attempting to estimate [8]. Bias can manifest in humans as distorted vision, reasoning, remembering, or judgment, resulting in decisions and results that vary for individ ua ls based on their membership in a protected community. There are various types of bias, includ ing subjective bias on the part of individuals, data bias, developer bias, and institutionalized prejudices that are rooted in the decision's underlying social context. If not addressed, bias will result in unfairness in automated decision-making systems [9].

## (s4) c) Sample bias
Number of References: 4

(p4.0) Another issue is sample bias, which happens when the data sample used to train the algorithm is not representative of the entire population due to systemic data collection errors. Any decisionmaking system based on this sample will be biased in either direction, favoring or opposing the over-or underrepresented party [12]. There are numerous explanations for a group's over-or underrepresentation in the results.

## (s5) d) Algorithm development bias
Number of References: 2

(p5.0) Apart from data bias as a source of unfairness, there are prejudices introduced during the algorithm's preparation. Throughout the process of developing an algorithm, researchers are confronted with a plethora of decisions that can steer the outcome in a variety of directions, including the selection of the dataset, the selection and encoding of features extracted from the dataset, the selection and encoding of the outcome variable, the rigor in which sources of bias in the data are identified, and the selection and specification of specific auxiliary variables [13]. Each decision is based on an implicit assumption. These assumptions are silent because they appear to be concealed behind an emphasis on mathematical precision and procedural rigor during the algorithm's development. Additionally, in many situations, the underlying assumptions are normative in nature.
## (s11) d) Approaches to Binary Classification
Number of References: 2

(p11.0) The majority of strategies for mitigating unfairness, bias, or discrimination are focused on the concept of protected or sensitive variables (we will use the words interchangeably) and (un)privileged classes: groups (often identified by one or more sensitive variables) that are statistically (less) more likely to be rated positively. Before delving into the critical components of the fairness system, it is necessary to address the essence of protected variables. Protected variables identify the characteristics of data that are socio-culturally precarious for machine learning applications. Sex, ethnic origin, and age are often used examples (as well as their synonyms) [17]. However, the term "protected variable" may refer to any aspect of data that includes or concerns humans.
## (s13) e) Modification/transformation
Number of References: 2

(p13.0) Transformation approaches learn a new representation of the data, frequently as a mapping or projection function, that ensures fairness while maintaining the fidelity of the machine learning task. Currently available transformation techniques are limited to numeric data, which is a major limitation [20]. There are several approaches to data transformation: operating on the dependent variable, operating on non-sensitive numeric variables, mapping individuals to an input space that is independent of safe subgroupings, and transforming the distribution of model predictions to meet unique fairness objectives. There are connections between blinding (in the immunity sense) and independence mappings, since both methods aim to achieve the same goal: independence from one or more unique sensitive variables. Other types of transformation include re-labelling and perturbation, which we classify separately. To illustrate the concept of transformation, we will turn the distribution of SAT scores toward the median in order to "degender" the original distributio n into one that preserves only the rank order of individuals regardless of gender. This is equivale nt to obfuscating knowledge about protected variables from a set of covariates. To mainta in predictive ability, transformation approaches often aim to preserve rank orders within transformed variables.
## (s16) g) Regularization and Optimization of Constraints
Number of References: 2

(p16.0) Regularization has traditionally been used in machine learning to penalize the difficulty of the learned hypothesis in order to prevent over-fitting [22]. Regularization techniques, when applied to fairness, apply one or more penalty words that penalize the classifier for discriminator y practices. Thus, it is not hypothesis-driven (or learned model-driven), but data-driven and founded on the considered notion(s) of justice. Most of the literature extends or augments the classifier's (convex) loss function with fairness terms, usually in an attempt to strike a balance between fairness and accuracy. Frequently, approaches to fair machine learning are not stable, i.e., small changes in the training data have a major effect on results (comparatively high standard deviatio n). During model training, constraint optimization approaches often incorporate notions of fairness into the classifier loss function operating on the confusion matrix.
