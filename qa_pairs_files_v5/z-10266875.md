(p4.0) Airway hyperresponsiveness to cholinergic stimulation is a hallmark of asthma, and thus the blockade of muscarinic receptor should be a potential therapeutic option. However, it has been just recently that this drug started to be considered as clinically important in asthma. Despite a long history of using plant alkaloids in relieving asthma attack [43], previous shortacting anticholinergics, including ipratropium bromide, failed to show significant efficacy. This lack of efficacy is supposed to be due to their lack of selectivity in antagonism, as simultaneous stimulation of different muscarinic subtypes could result in the decrease in bronchodilator effects [44]. However, now anticholinergics finally started to show promise, along with recent advances in characterization of muscarinic receptor subtypes, particularly M3 [44] and development of M3 selective antagonists [45]. M3 receptor has been identified as to have more important roles in the cholinergic bronchoconstriction pathway than other subtypes, and is considered to be the main target for bronchodilation in the asthmatic airways [46].

(p8.0) Choosing inhaler device Inhalation is the major route of drug administration for asthma, including corticosteroids, beta2-agonists or anticholinergics. However, cognitive dysfunction and decreased dexterity pose difficult problems with using inhalers in the elderly. As reported in an earlier study by Allen and Ragab [93], the competence of using asthma inhaler, metered dose inhaler (MDI) here, is significantly related to intellectual function in the elderly. MDI requires multiple stages for inhalation, and thus the technique learning is also hindered by dementia, cognitive impairment or dyspraxia [94]. Dry powder inhaler (DPI) has less steps (less requiring coordination) and may be easier to use; however, it requires sufficient inspiratory flow to aerosolize the power [95].

(p8.1) In an elderly asthma cohort study in US, 52.6% had correct DPI technique, whereas 37.6% had proper MDI technique [96]. Thus jet nebulizer may need to be considered as an alternative route of delivery in cases necessary, although it is not portable [95]. Using MDI with spacer could also be an alternative way [95]. Whether using a single type of inhaler for both of controller and relieve could bring better clinical outcomes [97], compared to using mixed types of devices, needs to be examined in the elderly. Collectively, physicians should always discuss with elderly patients on difficulties in using inhalers, and also prescribe the device that individual patients can use effectively.
