(p25.0) During the last decade, there have been an increasing number of randomized controlled trials of the efficacy and safety of the FGAs and secondary-generation antipsychotics in children and adolescents with schizophrenia, involving double-blind, placebo-controlled, or open-labeled design and short-to medium-term follow-up (ie, 4-8 weeks). 97-103 Those aged 12-17 years were usually included in the controlled trials, and a wide variety of second-generation antipsychotics such as quetapine, 97 risperidone, 98 paliperidone, 99 and olanzapine 100 were tested. A few main patient outcomes were commonly used, including global functioning, symptom severity, and quality-of-life assessment; however, few of the studies involved any long-term follow-up (ie, .8 weeks). [97][98][99][100][101][102][103] In addition, a few types of treatment-emergent adverse events specifically for the second-generation antipsychotic used were observed (eg, metabolic and endocrine abnormalities for olanzapine and somnolence, agitation and electrocardiogram (ECG) and ophthalmic abnormalities for quetiapine). Similar to other age groups, most of the antipsychotics have had positive benefits for adolescents on reducing psychotic symptoms and global functioning, and the treatment was well-tolerated with acceptable levels of adverse events in low and medium dosages. None of the FGAs or second-generation antipsychotics has shown its superiority over the others, and the benefits of polypharmacy to any psychotic symptoms and comorbidities such as mood disorders for adolescents are also inconclusive. 102,103 Nonetheless, it is suggested that antipsychotics are generally better tolerated and more effective in early psychosis.
