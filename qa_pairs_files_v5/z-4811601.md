## (s1) Modulating Tau Phosphorylation

(p1.0) The robust correlation existing between tau phosphorylation and pathology has provided the groundwork for the search for tau protein kinase inhibitors as potentially useful therapeutic agents. Considering that in vivo tau hyperphosphorylation is most likely the result of multiple protein kinase activities [15][16][17], whether the more effective target for reducing pathological tau phosphorylation is a specific kinase or distinct groups of protein kinases has remained an open question [18]. Several protein kinases, including GSK-3β, MARK, and CDK5, have all been proposed as potential therapeutic targets [19]. Notwithstanding the challenges faced by such approaches, especially concerning the issues of toxicity and specificity, developing protein kinase inhibitors has continued to be an area of intense preclinical efforts in recent years. The most advanced protein kinase inhibition strategy in the clinic so far has been aimed at GSK-3β [20,21].

(p1.1) It has been generally presumed that a meaningful proportion of the therapeutic effects observed with the mood stabilizing drug lithium is due to the inhibition of GSK-3, although the compound has other effects that cannot be disregarded, in particular on the inositol pathway. Thus, a handful of observational pilot studies have made an effort to address the clinical effect of lithium in patients with either AD or mild cognitive impairment, with inconsistent results partially attributable to low number of subjects recruited, low compliance, and narrow therapeutic window [22,23].

(p1.2) Tideglusib (NP031112, NP-12) is an orally available GSK-3β inhibitor [24] that in preclinical studies reduced tau phosphorylation, neuronal loss, and gliosis, and reversed a spatial memory deficit in transgenic mice [25]. Thirty patients with mild to moderate AD were treated for 20 weeks with tideglusib in a placebo-controlled, escalating-dose phase IIa clinical trial (NCT00948259), showing positive trends on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog tests [26]. A subsequent 6-month, phase IIb trial in 308 patients with mild to moderate AD was conducted in 55 centers across several European countries (NCT01350362). Tideglusib proved safe in the trial but missed its primary endpoint and some of the secondary endpoints, thus showing no significant clinical benefit [27]. The compound received U.S. food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) orphan drug status and was also evaluated in a 1-year study in 146 patients with PSP (NCT01049399). Again, this study did not meet the primary endpoint [28], although signs of decreased brain atrophy were reported in a subgroup analysis [29].

(p1.3) Another protein kinase that has received increasing attention as a potential therapeutic target is the tyrosine kinase Fyn, which phosphorylates tau in the N-terminal domain in dendrites and also has a role in the amyloid signaling pathway [30]. The repurposed small molecule saracatinib (AZD0530) is a Fyn inhibitor shown to reduce memory deficits in transgenic mice and reported to be safe and well tolerated in a phase I clinical trial (NCT01864655) [31]. A phase IIa multicenter study in 159 mild AD patients treated with saracatinib is still ongoing (NCT02167256).

(p1.4) On the other side of the phosphorylation coin are the phosphatases. Hence, activation of protein phosphatases has also been suggested as an additional strategy to reduce tau phosphorylation, especially in the instance of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the main brain phosphatase involved in tau phosphorylation [32]. Activation of PP2A is particularly challenging though, as it has broad substrate specificity and several regulatory subunits, which makes it difficult to identify the right pool of PP2A to be targeted to the right extent in the right place and time [33].
## (s2) Targeting Other Tau Post-Translational Modifications

(p2.0) Apart from phosphorylation, tau is also extensively post-translationally modified by lysine acetylation, which leads to impaired tau function and promotes pathological aggregation, which in turn has prompted proposing the use of tau acetylation inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD and other tauopathies [6]. Thus, salsalate-a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) approved by the FDA to treat arthritis and other conditions that cause swelling-has been shown to inhibit acetyltransferase p300-induced tau acetylation and improve tau-mediated behavioral impairments and neurodegeneration in an frontotemporal dementia (FTD) mouse model [34]. This compound is about to complete a 6-month multicenter, open label, pilot futility phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of orally administered salsalate in 10 patients with PSP (NCT02422485). More recently, a phase 1b clinical trial has been launched with the aim of evaluating its safety and tolerability in patients with prodromal to mild AD (NCT03277573). Forty participants will be randomized to receive either a placebo or salsalate twice daily for 1 year. Outcomes include changes in cerebrospìnal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRI, and cognitive function. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
