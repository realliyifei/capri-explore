(p13.0) One RCT was identified [8]. This trial compared the effectiveness of perforator-based interposition flaps versus full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) for the treatment of burn scar contractures (this paper was "in press" at the moment that the manuscript was prepared but it was not excluded from the analysis). The other ten papers were cohort studies with a pre-postoperative design: patients were measured before surgery and at a defined time period postoperatively. Most studies described a single procedure [9][10][11][12][13][14][15], one study described the outcomes of different adaptations of one flap [16], and one study compared the outcome of different flaps [17]. The range of follow-up periods varied from 2 months [18] to 8 years [11]. Overall, the sample size studied in the different papers was small ranging from 15 to 42.
## (s14) Outcome measures
Number of References: 19

(p14.0) The two most used outcome measures in the included studies were ROM [15,17,19] and surface area measurements of the flaps [8,12,14]. Range of motion was measured in degrees in the area of interest, which was either the neck or shoulder in most studies. Some authors measured the ROM preoperatively and compared this to the ROM postoperatively [8,9]. Others compared the postoperative ROM to the normal or "ideal" ROM [10,17]. Four studies only provided a narrative description of the long-term outcome, without presenting data [11,13,16,18]. Flap area measurement was performed by measuring the width of the flaps [8,12,14] or the surface area [8,14].
