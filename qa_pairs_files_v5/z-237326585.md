(p6.0) Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (fMRI-NF), despite its lower temporal resolution relative to EEG-NF (seconds compared to milliseconds), has superior spatial resolution (millimetre rather than centimetre) and has the advantage that it can target the key cortical and subcortical brain function deficits that have been established in ADHD over the past 25 years of fMRI research [51] (Rubia, 2018). fMRI-NF enables participants to self-regulate the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response of a targeted brain region or network through real-time feedback of their brain activity and has shown some promise in improving clinical symptoms and cognition in psychiatric disorders [109] (Thibault, MacPherson et al., 2018). To date, however, there are only two published fMRI-NF studies in ADHD.

(p6.1) The first fMRI-NF study was a small underpowered randomised controlled trial in seven adults with ADHD who underwent four weekly 1-h fMRI-NF of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), combined with a mental calculation task, while six ADHD patients completed the same task in the scanner but were presented with visual cues indicating level of task difficulty instead of fMRI-NF [110] (Zilverstand et al., 2017). Both groups significantly increased dACC activation over the NF runs, including the transfer runs, and improved in an interference inhibition task. Both groups showed trend-level improvements in ADHD symptoms but did not differ from each other. However, only the neurofeedback group showed significantly stronger performance improvement in sustained attention and working memory tasks after treatment, but not the ADHD group that received no fMRI-NF, indicative of some positive effects of fMRI-NF of dACC on cognition in adults with ADHD [110] (Zilverstand et al., 2017).
## (s10) Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)

(p10.0) tDCS applies a weak continuous direct electric current to underlying brain regions via scalp electrodes with the electrical current passing between a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode. In general, currents induce plasticity by causing subthreshold polarity-dependent increases (anodal stimulation) or decreases (cathodal stimulation) in membrane potentials that modify spontaneous discharge rates and cortical excitability, thus increasing/decreasing cortical function and synaptic strength [72] (Ashkan et al., 2013). tDCS is much easier to apply and has lower financial costs than TMS. Furthermore, tDCS has the advantage of being less painful than TMS and hence is more suitable for paediatric applications. Side effects are minimal in children (and adults), typically involving transient itching and reddening of the scalp site of stimulation in some participants (Krishnan et al., 2015; Zewdie et al., 2020) [148,149].

(p10.1) Combining cognitive training with tDCS over a cortical area that mediates the cognitive function being trained [134] (Kuo & Nitsche, 2012) has been shown to yield larger and long-lasting functional improvements that modify the impaired system [136]  Unlike with rTMS, the majority of tDCS studies (12 out of 18) (see Table 2) have been conducted in children with ADHD, presumably due to the high tolerability and relatively low side effect profile of tDCS, which would make it a good treatment option if efficacious. The majority of studies used very small session numbers and tested cognitive effects only (see Table 2).

(p10.2) Two double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover studies applied single session stimulation over the DLPFC. In 15 adolescents with ADHD, anode-left/cathode-right tDCS over bilateral DLPFC improved WCST completion time, n-back reaction times and Stroop reaction times and commission errors to incongruent trials but had no effect on n-back accuracy or Go/No-Go task performance [155]  . In 10 ADHD adolescents, anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC improved n-back accuracy and reaction times compared to both sham and cathodal tDCS; anodal and cathodal tDCS also improved WCST performance, but anodal tDCS led to greater improvement; cathodal tDCS also improved No-Go accuracy, potentially via interhemispheric inhibition increasing right prefrontal activation [155]  . This last finding is in line with a single-blind, crossover study in 21 adolescents with ADHD, which found in a subsample of seven participants that, compared to sham, one session of anodal, but not cathodal, tDCS over the right IFC reduced commission errors (trend-level) and reaction time variability in an interference inhibition task (Breitling et al., 2016) [159].

(p10.3) Two single-blind, sham-controlled crossover studies stimulated left DLPFC or right IFC in 20 high school students with ADHD symptoms that were above cut-off on validated ADHD questionnaires. Single session anodal relative to cathodal tDCS over the left DLPFC improved Go accuracy while cathodal tDCS relative to anodal tDCS and sham improved No-Go accuracy in the Go/No-Go task, but there was no change in Stroop task performance [160] (Soltaninejad et al., 2019). Anodal tDCS over the rIFC relative to sham improved Go accuracy, but there were no changes in other Go/No-Go or Stroop task measures (Soltaninejad et al., 2015) [161].
