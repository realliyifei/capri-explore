## (s1) Placenta and fetal fluid compartments
Number of References: 15

(p1.0) Amniotic fluid surrounds the developing fetus and is essential for normal morphological development. Inputs into amniotic fluid include the dilute fetal urine and the isotonic lung liquid, and pathways of exit of fluid include fetal swallowing, and transmembrane fluxes [12,13]. Thus abnormalities of amniotic fluid volume (oligo-and polyhydramnios) can result from abnormalities in fetal renal function, and oligohydramnios can be corrected, to some extent, by increase in maternal hydration [14,15]. Under normal circumstances the fetal fluid osmolality follows that of the mother, and fluid exchange occurs across the placenta, as well as across the amnion/chorion [16].

(p1.1) Before implantation the conceptus develops into a blastocyst, composed of the inner cell mass, and a fluid filled cavity surrounded by trophoectoderm epithelium. In the mouse aquaporins 3, 8, and 9 have been found to be expressed at this time, AQP3 and AQP8 being predominantly in the basolateral membranes of the trophoectoderm, and AQP9 in the apical membrane [17]. The trophoectoderm gives rise to the placenta and chorion; aquaporins 1, 3, 8 and 9 are water channel genes previously reported to be in the placenta and/or chorion of the human and sheep [18][19][20][21]. AQP1 has also been reported to be in the chick chorioallantoic membrane [22]. AQP1 is in the vasculature and AQP3 and 9 are in the apical membranes of human and ovine term placenta and chorion. The polarity of the AQP 8 has not yet been determined [18][19][20]. Recently we reported that AQP8 mRNA was also found in the ovine placenta [23].

(p3.0) In the adult kidney the bulk of the filtrate (81%) is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and descending limb of the loop of Henle, where AQP 1 is expressed. AQP1 is also expressed in the nonfenestrated descending vasa recta which are thought to be important for the establishment of the hypertonic environment of the medulla. In the mouse with the AQP1 gene deleted there is a lowered capacity to maximally concentrate urine [28]. However, the major concentration of urine depends on the presence of aquaporin 2 in the apical membranes of the principal cells of the collecting duct. This water channel protein resides in sub -membraneous vesicles in the absence of action of circulating vasopressin. Under the stimulus of increased vasopressin second messenger systems are activated which result in the phosphorylation of the vesicular AQP2 and transport and insertion into the apical membranes. Without this water channel it is impossible to reabsorb water in the medulla, even when an adequate osmotic gradient exists [2]. In many situations in which polyuria/concentrating defect occurs (potassium deficiency, lithium levels greater than 0.3 mmol/l, hypercalcemia, low protein diet among others) it can be linked to low levels of AQP2 [2]. The water absorbed via AQP2 in the apical membrane leaves the cell via aquaporins 3 and 4 which are constitutively expressed in the basolateral membranes of these cells [2]. In mice lacking expression of the AQP1 gene there is polyuria, and failure to be able to concentrate urine normally [28], and a similar urinary concentrating defect is seen in the rare humans who lack AQP1 [29]. A milder urinary concentrating defect is seen in transgenic mice lacking AQP4 [30]. This maybe because AQP3 is colocalised with AQP4 on the basolateral membrames of collecting duct principal cells, but when AQP3 is deleted a poyuria with a severe concentrating defect occurs [31]. AQP3 levels are regulated to some extent by vasopressin, as are those of AQP2, but are also regulated by aldosterone and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conducting factor (CFTR) [2,[32][33][34].

(p3.1) Metanephric kidney development varies in different species, being complete before birth in human and sheep, but not until substantially after birth in pigs, mice and rats. The ontogeny of some renal aquaporins has been examined in rats, sheep and humans. In the rat there is very little mRNA for AQP1 detected by Northern blotting or RNase protection, in the kidney, until a few days before birth [35,36]. However, there is some protein detected, by immunohistochemistry in the capillaries at the nephrogenic zone-medullary border by day 16. From day 17 the arcuate arteries are labeled, and, indeed the descending vasa recta are strongly labeled as they develop fully until 21 days post partum [37]. In contrast, in the sheep and human kidneys, AQP 1 mRNA, and protein are detected before mid-gestation (12 /40 weeks, human; 41/150 days, sheep) though the levels are just below 50% of adult levels even at term [38,39]. Levels of expression can be increased by both glucocorticoid and angiotensin II treatment of the fetus, both probably due to maturation of the kidney and longer proximal tubules which develop with treatment [39]. Adult levels are achieved after 15 months in the human, or 6 weeks in the sheep.

(p3.2) Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) is low at birth in the rat, but plateaus by 4 weeks post-partum [40]. Later studies showed it was present by Day 18 of fetal life and started increasing by day 3 post-natally [41]. In the sheep, at the beginning of the last third of gestation (100/150 d) the level of AQP2 mRNA is 17% of the adult, and near term it is still onlỹ 40% of the adult [42]. This correlates with reduced sensitivity of the fetal kidney to infused arginine vasopressin -at 100 days the plasma AVP concentration has to be raised to 16 pg/ml to achieve negative free water clearance, whereas close to term a level of 2 pg.ml is effective [43]. This is still a much higher level than required in the adult sheep, and so the fetal kidney resembles that of a subject with nephrogenic diabetes insidipus, due to inadequate expression of AQP2. The human fetal kidney also has a low level of AQP2 during the last half of gestation, and premature neonates produce dilute urine for many weeks [38,44]. AQP2 protein does appear in the urine [45], and there is a low level in the urine of premature neonates [46]. However the concentration of AQP2 protein in the urine of premature neonates did not correlate well with changes in urine osmolality, suggesting that it did not serve as a good marker of AVP function in the human premature neonate [47]. Fetal renal AQP2 levels can be increased by angiotensin II infusion, which is a real up-regulation of gene expression, and similar to the upregulation of vasopressin V2 receptor seen with angiotensin II infusion in adult rats [48].

(p3.3) There has been one study of AQP3, in fetal kidneys, suggesting it is there by day 18 in the rat [41]. The level of AQP4 protein labeling is very weak in the rat kidney 3 days after birth [36].
## (s5) Aquaporins in development -lung

(p5.0) At least four AQPs (AQP 1, 3, 4 and 5) are expressed in the lungs of various species, including humans, rats, mice and rabbits, although some discrepancies exist in the specific sites of distribution of these proteins. (Table 1 near here) In all species described so far (human, rat, mouse), AQP1 is expressed in the apical and basolateral membrane of the microvascular endothelium and decreased pulmonary vascular permeability has been shown in AQP1-null humans [3]. AQP3 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of basal cells of the tracheal epithelium and in submucosal gland cell membranes in rodents, but is also found in bronchioles (apical membrane) and type-II alveolar epithelial cells of adult humans [51]. AQP4 is present in the basolateral membrane of columnar cells in bronchi and trachea of rats but is also found in type-I AECs in humans. AQP5 is expressed in the apical membrane of type-I AECs and the apical plasma membranes of the secretory epithelium in upper airway and salivary glands [3]; it has also been detected in type-II AECs in mice [52]. These data are summarized in Table 2.
## (s6) Ontogeny of lung AQPs
Number of References: 13

(p6.0) In mice very low levels of AQP5 mRNA were detected before birth [53,54]. The ontogeny of the AQPs has also been described throughout development in rats, but only AQP1 and a small amount of AQP4 were detected before birth [55][56][57][58]. Furthermore, little is known of the physio-logical factors controlling AQP1 mRNA expression before birth, although its expression (and protein levels) is increased in the lungs of fetal and neonatal rats following treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids [55,58]. In one study [58], but not in another [55], AQP4 was increased by corticosteroids. In the same study [58], β-adrenergic agents also increased AQP4. Although AQP5 protein was almost undetectable in lung tissue homogenates at E21 and PN1, a strong signal was detected at PN2 [55], indicating that the accumulation of AQP5 protein in the rat lung is predominantly postnatal. Indeed, AQP5 protein levels in lung tissue increased twenty-fold to PN14 and then increased a further ten-fold from PN14 to adult. In contrast to AQP1, AQP5 is not influenced by corticosteroids in rats, which is consistent with the finding that AQP5 protein predominantly accumulates in the lung postnatally. Similarly, AQP3 protein levels were undetectable in fetal lung tissue and then were only detected in the trachea of postnatal animals well after the time of birth. AQP4 protein seemed to be present transiently at PN2 in peripheral lung membranes and only appeared by PN12 in the trachea of rats In a recent study we have shown that the mRNAs for at least four AQPs (1, 3, 4 and 5), as well as their respective proteins, are present in the ovine fetal lung well before birth [11]. For AQP1 and AQP5, the level of mRNA expression in the fetal lung exceeded that of the adult lung. Furthermore, we have shown that cortisol infusions significantly up-regulated the expression of AQPs 1 and 5, whereas increases in fetal lung expansion, induced by tracheal obstruction (TO), significantly decreased AQP5 mRNA levels in fetal lung tissue. Although AQP5 protein levels did not appear to decrease with TO, measurable changes in AQP5 levels in whole lung tissue is likely to be complicated by the localisation of this protein to multiple cell types within the lung. These findings indicate that factors known to regulate fetal lung growth and maturation as well as fluid secretion, also regulate the expression of AQPs 1 and 5. This suggests that there are physiological roles for some lung aquaporins before birth.
## (s7) Skin
Number of References: 8

(p7.0) The skin of the adult 70 kg man normally contains about 7 l of fluid, about 50% of which is interstitial [59]. The fluid is stored in the dermis associated with hyaluronic acid, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans, and helps to determine the turgor, distensibility and elasticity of the skin. The major barrier to water loss from the skin is the superficial stratum corneum -flattened dead corneocytes [60]. Below this are the keratinocytes, which express the gene for aquaporin 3, particularly in the basal and intermediate layers [61][62][63]. Aquaporin 3 is a membrane protein which increases the permeability to water, urea and glycerol. When the gene is deleted in the mouse the skin has decreased hydration but grossly normal morphology [62]. The reduction in skin elasticity, as well as the delay in recovery of barrier function after tape stripping, were thought to be related to the deficiency in glycerol transport which occurred in the AQP3 deficient mice [64]. This was further supported by the reversal of these deficits by glycerol replacement [65].

(p8.0) In the human fetus there is a double layer of epidermal cells by 4 weeks; the stratum corneum begins to develop by 24 weeks, and is generally well developed by 34 weeks. [60]. Barrier function, which is conferred by the stratum corneum, of cornified cells and extracellular lipid, can be measured by transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and generally forms late in gestation in mice, rats, rabbits and humans [66,67]. Amniotic fluid, particularly early in pregnancy, is very similar in composition to fetal extracellular fluid, and it is quite likely that here is fairly free exchange across the fetal skin, particularly in the first half of gestation [68]. Even in species such as the sheep, which develop substantial wool covering in the last third of gestation, there is substantial exchange of fluid and electrolyte across the skin until relatively late in development [69]. There is also substantial expression of AQP3 in midgestation ovine fetal skin. Preterm infants are at risk of dehydration because of very large TEWL [70]. In fetal rats the TEWL is high at day E18, and there are higher levels of AQP3 mRNA in the fetal than in the adult skin [71].
