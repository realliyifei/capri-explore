(p0.0) High-altitude environments present additional ocular risks to the unwary traveller and these have been comprehensively reviewed by Izadi and colleagues. 18Common high-altitude eye problems include high altitude retinopathy, 19 optic disc swelling and dry eyes.High altitude retinopathy is manifest by engorged and tortuous retinal vessels secondary to hyperviscosity due to polycythaemia, 20 and may present with retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots and papilloedema.The traveller's visual acuity may be preserved or it may be threatened if a macular haemorrhage occurs.The increased prevalence of dry eyes at altitude has been associated with both a decrease in tear production, as well as accelerated tear evaporation due to the dry and windy environment. 21Dry eyes are often merely an irritation to the traveller; however, severe episodes increase susceptibility to eye infection, and can be distressing, especially when accompanied by deteriorating vision.Travellers with comorbidities are more vulnerable to the effects of hypoxia at altitude and may be advised to avoid such environments. 22For individuals who are susceptible to dry eyes, minimal contact lens usage should be recommended.Additionally, lubricating eye drops should be provided for symptomatic relief of dry eyes.More viscous ointments provide prolonged relief at the expense of visual acuity. 16The use of goggles and wraparound sunglasses should be advised as they can also limit the evaporation of tears.

(p2.0) Pre-existing ocular conditions increase susceptibility to several travel-related eye problems.Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the optic nerve associated with excessive intraocular pressure.The presence of glaucoma exacerbates insults to the optic nerve when exposed to a hypoxic environment such as high altitude. 21There is evidence of exacerbation of angle-closure glaucoma on long-haul flights as the dimly lit environment causes mydriasis, precipitating a pupil block. 7This principle could be applied to a wide range of travel-related activities in low ambient light environments and warrants additional precautions.Oral acetazolamide has been suggested as a viable alternative to the use of beta-blockers and is used in some trekkers to prevent acute mountain sickness. 21Medical gases such as perfluoropropane or sulphur hexafluoride are often used in vitreoretinal surgery.This presents risks to air travellers due to Boyle's law, which ordains that, as the cabin pressure at flight altitudes is lower than the sea level, any intraocular gas bubbles will expand and increase the intraocular pressure.Patients with recent vitreoretinal surgery involving intraocular gas should be strongly advised not to undertake air travel, regardless of the volume of gas applied. 25
