(p7.0) The sediments of the Precambrian could be different from those found in today's environments. In particular, a substantial number of BIFs with alternating layers of iron minerals and silica were formed in the Precambrian (e.g., Konhauser et al., 2017), in contrast to the lack of such deposits during the Phanerozoic. Both abiotic and biotic models of BIF formation have been proposed and intensely investigated. Many microbial experiments have been performed to investigate the mechanism of BIF formation, which has been reviewed in Posth et al. (2013Posth et al. ( , 2014 and will only be briefly discussed here.
