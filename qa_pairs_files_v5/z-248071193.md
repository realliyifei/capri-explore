## (s1) Epidemiology of Obesity and Weight Gain in those who Habitually Eat at Night or Later in the Day
Number of References: 6

(p1.0) As a population, there has been a shift in the timing of when we eat with observational data reporting consumption of a greater proportion of energy towards the latter half of the day [12]. Data from the 2011-2015 NHANES survey indicated that up to 45% of daily energy intake comprises evening meals and snacks [13]. These changes to our lifestyle may have implications for weight maintenance. A number of observational studies have explored the association between meal timing and weight status drawing associations between long-term weight gain and the time at which the majority of energy is consumed even when total energy intake is adjusted for. The evidence is more compelling when we examine findings from populations who have little choice but to eat at night such as shift-workers.

(p1.1) In a cohort of 1245 individuals, participants who consumed ≥ 48% of their daily energy intake at dinner were twice as likely to be obese at 6-year follow-up, even after adjustment for variations in energy intake, physical activity and BMI at baseline. (OR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.17; 4.65) [14]. In a separate study of 239 participants, Wang et al. determined that those who consumed ≥ 33% of total energy in the evening (compared to < 33%) were twice as likely to be overweight or obese (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.03; 3.89). with these findings being adjusted for variations in total energy intake and physical activity [15]. In a review, Fong et al. [16] summarised nine cross-sectional and one prospective cohort studies, and found that four of the ten studies observed a positive association between increased evening intake and increased body weight. Of the remaining studies, five found no association and one a negative association between increased evening food consumption and increased body weight. Important to note, is the high degree of heterogeneity noted by the authors observed in both the assessment of exposure and outcome variables which may have contributed to the inconsistency in findings. Conversely, consuming a greater proportion of energy at lunch, i.e. earlier during the day, appeared to reduce the risk of weight gain at 3.5-year follow-up (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.47; 0.80) [17].
## (s2) Metabolic Processes are Governed by the Circadian Clock and Mis-timed Meals can cause Circadian Disruption

(p2.0) Humans are diurnal animals, with activity periods typically occurring during the daytime hours. Correct alignment of active versus rest periods with the constant cycling of light and dark from the Earth's rotation is achieved through an adaptable endogenous timekeeping mechanism, the master clock. This resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and is entrained by the perception of light in the retina [26]. In turn, this master clock synchronises molecular peripheral clocks, oscillations in negative and positive arms of core clock gene transcripts found in every cell [27]. These oscillations of the peripheral clock regulate output genes which coordinate many physiological processes, including hormone secretion and metabolism, thus ensuring they are timed to occur in the correct phase of activity or rest [28]. Approximately 15% of the metabolome oscillates across the day [29]. The regulation of metabolic responses has also shown to be different across the day, with eating at night eliciting a different postmeal regulatory response in gene expression compared to eating during the day, with less genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways activated at night [30]. Notably, homeostasis of glucose and lipid blood concentrations are under circadian regulation, with decreased glucose [31] and lipid clearance [32] during the night-time hours.

(p2.1) Mistimed eating in relation to body clocks causes circadian disruption. This disruption can occur on both an external level i.e. a misalignment of feed/fast cycles with the body clocks, and an internal level, by food acting as an entraining cue for peripheral clocks, causing an uncoupling of the peripheral clocks in metabolic tissue with the master clock rhythm set to daylight [33]. Animal models of circadian disruption i.e. active and eating at night, in inversion to the internal rhythms set by the master clock, have produced increases in body weight after meals were timed in the usual rest phase compared to the active phase, even in isoenergetic conditions [34]. Although experimental evidence in humans is lacking, circadian disruption has been linked to metabolic disturbances; 8 days of a circadian disruption protocol in ten adults caused a 22% increase in insulin levels (p = 0.006) and 6% increase in glucose (p < 0.001) [35]. Additionally, in dietary weight loss interventions that compared differences in the temporal patterns of meals found lower success with achieving weight loss in those people who had late meal timings [36]. The internal body clock broadly impacts many aspects of metabolic regulation which are involved in the development of obesity (Fig. 1), it is important therefore to further explore the potential mechanisms which may facilitate this.
## (s4) Variation Across the Day in Hunger and Satiety Hormones may Impact Weight Regulation

(p4.0) Appetite regulating hormones ghrelin and leptin exhibit daily rhythms of synthesis and secretion [39]. Leptin, secreted from white adipocytes, is implicated in the regulation of hunger, food intake and energy balance, while ghrelin stimulates appetite, fat production, and body growth-leading to increased food intake and body weight. The circulating level of ghrelin is mainly regulated by nutritional status, rising by fasting and decreasing after food ingestion [40]. The circadian peak in ratings of hunger occurs in the biological evening, and the circadian trough in hunger ratings occurs in the biological morning [41] corresponding with ghrelin levels being elevated at night.

(p4.1) Obesity is associated with impairments in circadian rhythms of appetite regulating hormones including leptin where the nocturnal peak (close to midnight) is delayed by ~ 3 h compared with normal-weight, sex-matched control participants [42]. Weight loss can restore this deregulation [43]. Participants in a 12-week hypocaloric intervention who achieved a mean weight loss of 10%, had partially restored daily rhythms of leptin and a modified ghrelin rhythm, but appetite sensations were barely modified which is indicative of leptin resistance. Despite some improvements in hormonal regulation associated with weight loss, when excessive adipose tissue remains, these hormones still do not display normal physiological functionality [44].
## (s5) Contribution of Diurnal Changes in the Gut Microbiome to Weight Gain and Obesity
Number of References: 10

(p5.0) The gut microbiota (e.g. the community of different microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract), and the microbiome (e.g. these microorganisms and their genes), influence the health of their human hosts including the development of obesity, and its further complications [11]. Metabolites produced by the gut microbiota act as a link between gut microbiota and its host and the composition of the gut microbiota is dynamic and undergoes daily cyclic fluctuations [49]; with this rhythm being affected by light/dark cycles, sleep/wake cycles, dietary composition and eating patterns.

(p5.1) There are complex relationships between circadian rhythms, gut microbes, and energy metabolism. Several changes in gut function are observed with circadian disruption including enhanced gut permeability, resulting in the dysfunction of gut barrier and alteration of gut microbiome [50,51]. Changes to both the abundance and diversity of the microbiota alter dietary metabolism and the extent to which humans are able to derive energy from foods [52]. Studies in mice indicate peaks in the abundance of the bacterial phylum, Firmicutes, immediately after meals, with the more beneficial phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria only able to bloom during periods of fasting [51]. The balance between these phyla also changes in humans; a 20% increase in Firmicutes with a corresponding decrease in Bacteroides was associated with an increased energy harvest from the host diet of 630 kJ per day, potentially resulting in a body weight gain of 5 kg over 1 year [52]. Furthermore, obese populations (both human and rodent) have been found to have a shift in their gut microbiome compared with lean population towards an imbalance such that the Bacteroidetes phylum is lower and the Firmicutes phylum is higher which would in turn, lead to greater energy being obtained from the host diet of obese people [53].

(p5.2) If circadian rhythms are constantly disrupted, as occurs with frequent late or night-time eating, this has been shown to uncouple peripheral circadian clocks in intestinal epithelial cells [54] which can then reduce fuel utilisation and lead to fuel storage in adipose tissue. Thus, the alteration in fuel utilisation has been proposed as a contributor to weight gain in shift workers who routinely face circadian misalignment. Time restricted feeding in rodent models partially restores this misalignment and in turn has been shown to influence the improve host metabolic efficiency [55]. Thus, time restricted eating (TRE) has potential as a strategy to help not only with weight management through reduced energy intake but also through regulation of the circadian rhythms of microbiota.
