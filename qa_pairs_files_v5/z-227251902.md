(p5.0) Most of the published reports about Karwinskia toxicity are focused on the PNS. Oral administration of crude homogenate of K. humboldtiana fruit, or toxins isolated from it, produces distal segmental demyelinization and degenerative changes of peripheral nerves in several animal species [14,[55][56][57][58][59]. In turn, these changes produce a conduction block of nerve impulses [60,61] and a depression of fast axonal transport [62][63][64]. Furthermore, it has been observed that distal hind limb muscles of treated animals are partially denervated [60,65].

(p5.1) Axonal degeneration is more extensive at the ends of long nerves [55][56][57]. Regeneration may occur in nerve fibers which have undergone degeneration [55,59].
