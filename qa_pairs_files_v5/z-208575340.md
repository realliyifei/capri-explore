(p10.0) Derivative of quinine, chloroquine, 8aminoquinoline and known antimalarial M18AAP inhibitors (AID743024) (Kumari et al., 2016) More recently, Upadhyay et al. (2014) reported antimalarial potential of extracts and compounds from the chloroform and n-butanol fractions of Ammannia baccifera roots and methanol extract of Ammannia coccinea (AC).These extracts are commonly used in Chinese and Indian medicine as a therapy for diseases.The compounds were isolated from the extracted and fractionated dried and powdered samples, followed by repeated chromatographic separations of the fractions.The compounds effectiveness was demonstrated in vitro through antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum NF-5.Extracts from AC showed potency in antiplasmodial activity and nontoxic to Vero cells.The authors thus concluded that the selective antiplasmodial activity from these plants will be advantageous in antimalarial drug development and discovery of safer therapeutics (Upadhyay et al., 2014).

(p10.1) Thiengsusuk & Chaijaroenkul (2013) performed an evaluation of antimalarial activities of Thai traditional medicine which consist of 27 medicinal plants and 5 herbal formulations used against chloroquine-resistant (K1) and chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) P. falciparum clones.Their results indicate that that ethanolic extracts from 19 investigated plants/herbal formulations exhibited promising activity against both K1 and 3D7 clones of P. falciparum, with < 50% survival at the concentration of 50 μg/ml.In addition, eight medicinal plants and two herbal formulations that were included in this investigation showed potent antimalarial activity with median range IC50 values < 10 μg/ml against K1 or 3D7 P. falciparum clone or both (Thiengsusuk & Chaijaroenkul 2013).Sethiya et al. (2014) screened methanol extract of Evolvulus alsinoides for P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase enzyme inhibitory activity, reporting that E. alsinoides possesses a compound known as scopoletin that potentially inhibits the PfLDH.E. alsinoides is generally recognized as Shankhpushpi and is used in traditional remedy for malarial treatment by some ethnic populations of India (Sethiya et al., 2014).
