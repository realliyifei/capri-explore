(p4.0) Measurement of IAP was recommended after recognition of severe effects of increased IAP and due to a low sensitivity of the whole series of clinical examinations tests [20]. The main variants of IAP measurement are presented in Table II [21].

(p4.1) The direct method is the most sensitive in determining PIA values. It is an invasive one, not without complications [22]. Laparoscopy allows the direct recording of IAP throughout the surgical procedure and allows the pneumoperitoneum pressure to be controlled. Studies related to the negative impact of intra-abdominal hypertension on body systems have been correlated with establishing the standard value of pneumoperitoneum pressure commonly used in laparoscopic interventions at 12 mmHg -capillary perfusion pressure [23].
