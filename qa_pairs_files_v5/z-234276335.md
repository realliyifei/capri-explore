(p16.0) Zinc is one of the important elements for humans and problems may occur due to not eating this element. Excessive exposure to this ingredient causes toxic effects through the mouth or the skin and causes gastrointestinal pain. So far, there is no evidence proving that zinc is a carcinogen, but it is known that the high density of this mineral is toxic to living cells [42]. Moreover, it was found that toothpaste contains high levels of zinc (1842 and 2417 ppm). These ratios were higher than reported by Odukudu et al. [43] for toothpaste formulations (0.743 ppm). On the other hand, children's toothpaste does not contain the element zinc. Meanwhile, zinc is found in plaque, saliva, and tooth enamel. However, zinc has been incorporated into toothpaste to keep the teeth clean. Furthermore, a study by Lynch [20], it was observed that elevated zinc levels persist for hours after using toothpaste for oral hygiene.
