## (s2) SYMPTOMS OF FOLLICULAR CONTACT DERMATITIS
Number of References: 5

(p2.0) Follicular contact dermatitis is usually characterized by individual papules that include a central hair follicle. However, prominent hairs within the papules may not be readily visible when the lesions surround vellus hairs [1] . The papular lesions are frequently pruritic and occasionally painful or burning. The individual lesions have also been described as poral [2,3] or acneiform [1] . In addition, the clinical spectrum of follicular contact dermatitis also includes follicular-based pustules [3] .

(p7.0) Neomycin-drug characteristics: Neomycin is produced by the growth of Streptomyces fradiae. It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial is based upon the drug's ability to irreversibly bind to the 30S ribosomal RNA subunits and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis [13,[30][31][32] .

(p7.1) Neomycin can be used as a topical antibiotic and has activity against many aerobic Gram-negative organisms (except Pseudomonas aeruginosa). It is also effective against some aerobic Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococci. However it is not effective against Streptococci [13,[30][31][32] .

(p7.2) Neomycin is usually formulated commercially as 20% neomycin sulfate in a petrolatum vehicle. However, it is often combined with other topical antibiotics such as bacitracin zinc and polymyxin B sulfate. This is done to expand the antimicrobial coverage [13,[30][31][32] .

(p9.0) Allergic contact dermatitis to neomycin was initially reported in 1952 [36] . Six years later, in 1958, Epstein [9] described contact dermatitis to neomycin as "…an aggravation or "irritation" of a preexisting dermatitis…" and not the obvious picture of an acute contact dermatitis. He considered it to represent a dermal contact sensitivity reaction [9] . The lesions elicited by patch testing clinically presented as papules and histologically demonstrated an intact epidermis with pathologic changes in the dermis [9] .

(p9.1) Subsequently, Jillson et al [7] reported contact dermatitis to neomycin in 10 patients with atopic dermatitis. One of the patients, a 50-year-old woman had an eczematous dermatitis of her left flexor arm for which prior treatment with neomycin ointment had irritated the dermati-Cohen PR. Follicular contact dermatitis tis [7] . Patch testing to neomycin ointment "…was characterized by multiple small (papules of) eczematous areas rather than a confluent eczematous plaque [7] ".

(p19.0) infundibular folliculitis-even though they were Caucasian [6,10] . In contrast to follicular contact dermatitis which was characterized by severe itching or areas of erythema and oozing or both in some of the patients, infundibular folliculitis is typically observed in black patients as mild to moderately pruritic or burning, flesh colored, widely distributed, non-inflammatory follicular papules; the papules are typically refractory to treatment and the recurrent episodes persist for weeks to months before spontaneously resolving [43,44] . An individual in whom infundibulofolliculitis was suspected presented with recurrent 2-mm erythematous follicular papules. She was a 24-year-old nurse whose skin eruption partially improved with topical corticosteroids and resolved when her boyfriend moved to another city. However, it recurred when he returned and they went to the beach. Subsequently, the diagnosis of consort follicular contact dermatitis to the homomenthyl salicylate in her boy friend's Coppertone sunscreen lotion was considered and confirmed by positive patch testing to the lotion; additional patch testing to each component of the lotion was only positive for homomenthyl salicylate [6] .

(p19.1) The other patients had been exposed to a chemical used in colored permanent-pressed sheets [10] . Not only the distribution and duration of the follicular contact dermatitis, but also the histopathology of the chemical-associated lesions were similar to those observed in individuals with infundibulofolliculitis. However several features permitted the patients with follicular contact dermatitis to be differentiated from those with infundibulofolliculitis: severe itching (as compared to mild or moderate pruritus), the presence of erythematous and even oozing areas (as compared to nonflammatory lesions) and a white patient population (as compared to occurring in African American individuals) [10] .
