(p23.0) The characteristic clinical feature is painful necrosis of the interdental papillae and the gingival margins, and the formation of craters covered with a gray pseudo membrane. [31]The clinical presentation of ANUG reflects its histopathology. [31]From the surface to the deeper levels of the lesion, four distinct layers have been described by (Listgarten et al. 1965). [32]They include 1.A bacterial area of fibrous mesh made up of epithelial cells, leukocytes, and a variety of bacterial cells, such as rods, fusiform bacteria, and spirochetes, are the most superficial.2. There is a neutrophil-rich zone that is deeper and contains more leukocytes, spirochetes, and bacterial cells.3. Necrotic zone with spirochetes, fusiform bacteria, and fragmented cells.4. Spirochetes have infiltrated the deepest layer. [32].Wegener's granulomatosis Wegener's granulomatosis appears as a pattern of mixed inflammation centered around the blood vessels.Transmural inflammation is seen in involved vessels, and there are frequent areas of strong neutrophil infiltration, necrosis, and nuclear dust as well (leukocytoclastic vasculitis). [33]A variable mixture of histiocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and multinucleated giant cells make up the inflammatory cellular infiltrate in the connective tissue adjacent to the vessel. [33]
