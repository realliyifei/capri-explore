(p0.0) Pain along the shinbone (tibia) is termed "shin splints," which occurs due to the inflammation of the tissue in the area. It is also known as medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). Military recruits, runners, and dancers are all at risk of shin splint. Athletes who have recently increased or modified their training programs are prone to this, as well as athletes who have not properly warmed up, increased their training mileage suddenly, or have hyperpronated their feet. Muscles, tendons, and bone tissues are overworked as a result of increased exercise. For an athlete, this kind of injury can disturb their performance and all their activities [1]. A stress fracture of the tibia, which is represented by focused discomfort in the front tibia, is the most frequent complication of medial tibial stress syndrome [2]. The discomfort gradually lasts longer into the run as a patient's injury gets worse; eventually, it lasts through the cooldown and into daily activities and can localize to become point soreness [3]. People with a higher body mass index (BMI) and those who had previously used orthotic devices for a long time were shown to be more likely to develop diabetes. This condition affects the lower leg [4].
