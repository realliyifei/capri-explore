Number of References: 2

(p16.0) As explained above, Raman spectroscopy requires high laser power and long exposure times. With precisely focused and installed Raman probe-heads ( Figure 9) 2D Raman scanning is possible [24]. Even 3D Raman scanning seems to be achievable. Figure 9.

In the measurements conducted so far, this method has made it possible to visualize 2D Raman scans in fluids for the molecular quantification of the concentration profiles in microchannels and to perform the fundamental investigation of the mixing processes of different accessible fluids, as shown in Figure 10 [24].
