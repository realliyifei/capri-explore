(p0.0) In the pharmaceutical industry, computational techniques to screen for bioactive molecules have become an established complement to classical experimental high-throughput screening methods. Previous success stories have shown that using virtual screening approaches can help to reduce the required time and costs for drug development projects and mitigate the risk for latestage failures (e.g. in silico techniques were instrumental in the development of the HIV integrase inhibitor Raltegravir [1], the anticoagulant Tirofiban [2] and the influenza drug compound Zanamivir [3]). In recent years, the combination of increasing computing power, improved algorithms and a wider availability of relevant software tools and data repositories has made preclinical drug research using virtual screening more feasible for academic laboratories. However, setting up an efficient and effective screening pipeline is still a major challenge, and a greater awareness about freely available screening, quality control and workflow management software published in recent years would help to more fully exploit the potential of in silico screening.
## (s4) Protein-ligand interaction and binding affinity databases

(p4.0) For most proteins, only few or no small-molecule binders with high affinity (in the nanomolar or low micromolar range) and selectivity are already known from previous studies. Moreover, the reported affinities often vary significantly depending on the used measurement technique [18]. Proteins with multiple known and well-characterized binders for the same binding pocket, however, cover several targets of biomedical interest, and the existing data can provide opportunities for identifying new structurally similar molecules with improved selectivity and affinity via ligand-based screening (see dedicated section below). Moreover, existing interaction and binding affinity data are a useful resource for identifying or predicting off-target effects [19]. To collect information on the known protein-ligand interactions for a receptor or small molecule of interest, Table 2 lists the main relevant databases, most of which are publicly accessible. Drug2Gene [29], the currently most comprehensive meta-database, may provide a first point of reference for most types of queries. Other repositories have a more specific scope, e.g. PDBbind [30] focuses exclusively on binding affinity data from protein-ligand complexes in the PDB. As the databases in Table 2 are updated at different intervals and contain many non-overlapping entries, a study requiring a comprehensive coverage of known interactions for a target molecule should collect current data from all accessible repositories. Importantly, issues in data heterogeneity, redundancies and biases in the database curation process can result in biased in silico models of drug effects, and strategies proposed to address or alleviate these problems include the use of model-based integration approaches (e.g. KIBA [31]) and sophisticated data curation and filtering processes (e.g. the procedure proposed by Kramer et al. [32], which includes the calculation of several objective quality measures from differences between reported measurements).
