(p7.0) Recently, an Indian research group analyzed the activity of the probiotic L. fermentum MCC2759 and MCC2760 on intestinal markers of inflammation using a high-fat diet model associated with the STZ-induced diabetic model [48]. Both L. fermentum strains were administered in a concentration of 1 × 10 9 CFU/mL for 4 wk. The main findings of the study revealed that diabetic female rats treated with L. fermentum MCC2759 and MCC2760 reduced blood glucose levels, increased insulin levels, and improved the lipid profile [48]. Coupled with biochemical changes, L. fermentum administration downregulated TNF-α mRNA and up-regulated mRNA IL-10 in the intestine, liver, mesenteric adipose tissue, and muscle, suggesting that the anti-diabetic effect promoted by L. fermentum MCC2759 and MCC2760 can be associated with a decrease in inflammatory markers [48]. In addition, L. fermentum MCC2759 and MCC2760 administration modulated other gene expressions, such as reduced expression of Toll-like receptor 4, enhanced expression of tight junction protein ZO-1, endocannabinoid receptor CB2 and GLP1, glucose transporter type 4 in mesenteric adipose tissue and muscle tissue. The results demonstrated that L. fermentum MCC2759 and MCC2760 might be a potential probiotic in treating type 2 DM.

(p8.0) L. fermentum MF423 is a strain isolated from Chinese rice noodle wastewater [31]. The authors analyzed adverse effects triggered by an experimental model of type 2 DM induced by STZ and tested the effectiveness of different therapies, including supplementation with unfermented extracts of defatted rice bran, high and low doses of defatted rice bran fermented by L. fermentum MF423, and drug intervention (pioglitazone) [31]. Mice receiving a high dose (1 g/kg) of defatted rice bran fermentation extracts containing L. fermentum MF423 for 8 wk evidenced weight loss and reduced fasting blood glucose, lipid accumulation, and liver cells damage [31]. Moreover, probiotic groups intensified antioxidant activity in diabetic mice through up-regulation levels of SOD, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and reversed elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver [31]. It is important to mention that no effects were found in animals treated only by unfermented extracts of rice bran, highlighting the antioxidant activity of L. fermentum MF423.
