(p7.0) Diagnosis of BVD and MD requires laboratory support in the form of virus isolation, virus antigen detection and serum antibody determination. Skin biopsies are the tissues of choice for the diagnosis of BVDV, using immunohistological techniques and are always positive in persistently infected animals (Braun et al., 1999). This method should also be applied in the diagnosis of this disease in camelids (Evermann et al., 1993). Goyal et al. (2002) stressed multiple test systems should be applied for arriving a proper diagnosis because their immunhistochemical examination of Science Publications AJV various tissues were negative although a ncp type 1b was isolated from the tissues.
