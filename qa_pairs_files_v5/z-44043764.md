(p26.0) Meskell et al. [33] and Walsh et al. [7] both examined OSCE.Meskell et al. [33] evaluated the benefits of using an electronic OSCE assessment system in undergraduate students (n = 203).The electronic software facilitated the storage and analysis of results, thus offering significant time savings.Walsh et al. [7] were focused on the development of a Novice OSCE that included the following competencies: safety, asepsis, knowledge, organization, and caring.An instrument-testing design on a sample of nursing students (n = 565) was used.The MMAT score of both papers was 50%.Some psychometric analysis, reliability, and stability of OSCE tool should be done.OSCE is shown as a formative assessing tool, and it is argued that students should also be assessed in critical thinking and problem-solving skills in addition to clinical skills performance [1,35].
