(p4.0) The field procedures play a crucial role in the isolation of diatoms, microalgae, or other species. In a riverine environment, small boulders (rocks) and cobbles are the most favored substratum for diatoms screening. Almost all diatom indexed to the eplithion community found here where epilithion`s ecology is recognized better than any other group [63]. Bricks, concrete, bridge supports, canal walls, etc. may be used as an alternative substratum, whereas simulated substrate can be set up into the stream if pebbles, cobbles, boulders, or macrophytes do not exist from the site though sampling should be done if they have been plunged for several weeks [47]. Sampling is an important step towards the collection of diatoms as the whole isolation process depends on it. The collected water sample may contain dead cells or damaged cells, which is not considered good, so it becomes very crucial to ideally collect the sample and isolate the most viable cells at the earliest. Keeping the water sample for longer times is not recommended because environmental conditions change very frequently, which leads to cell death. Some species multiply quickly and suddenly die, in that case, isolation should be done rapidly. Sometimes, a planktonic net can be used to concentrate the sample as it removes other unwanted algal species, microorganisms, or debris but should be avoided as more concentrated sample leads to more damaged cells [47,63].

(p5.0) The identification of a suitable substrate is a pivotal step to recognize the diatom communities in the natural environment. Diatom communities form a slimy layer or thin golden-brown layer on the substratum. It can be more noticeable by feel or touch and can be identified at a specific time depending on species. The substratum can be differentiated into a preferred substrate and an alternative substrate. Diatom attaches to different substrata or facilitates locomotion by releasing mucilage from various structures of the cell wall [65]. Diatom community composition is mainly influenced by chemicals present in water, water turbulence, temperature and light present in water, being eaten by large microorganisms, etc. The most preferred substratum is the solid substratum. It mainly includes cobbles/pebbles and small rocks (Epilithon). Fig. 2 depicts various substrates intended for diatoms sampling. They are widely available in almost every aquatic habitat and throughout the year. In the absence of a solid substrate, submerged or emerging macrophytic plants (epiphyte) should be sampled as it also provides a suitable habitat for diatom communities. It is ideal to note the microhabitat of diatoms species [35].
## (s20) Micromanipulation

(p20.0) Diatoms are valuable for the aquatic food chain and give significant bioactive compounds to human prosperity. Segregating unadulterated species or getting axenic culture from a polluted water source is a complicated and tedious procedure with the current strategies. Hence, it becomes necessary to search for other advanced isolation techniques. Micromanipulation is one such method permitting refined, confining single species in a more cleansed manner. Prior fine capillary tubes were used focusing on target cells under microscopic observation, which is a laborious task and threat to contamination [83]. With the arrival of a modern, sophisticated micromanipulator exploiting micromanipulator and stereomicroscope, a high level of precision can be achieved for screening and isolation of species of interest [80]. A cell of interest can be captured utilizing a focused laser and transferred to a sterile media of interest. This system is still in its early stages because of the high state of expertise and time required [84].

(p21.0) The requirement for cutting edge new methods push researcher to redesign the flow cytometer coupling FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting). The premise of this procedure is light scattering and fluorescence [84]. Cells absorb the laser beam transmit fluorescence and give information on cell size, pigments, and reliability of species, which is identified with the morphology and other characteristics of the species accordingly, thus allowing characterization of up to 10,000 cells in a fraction of second [85]. This technique can be employed to build up an axenic culture and get rid of any bacterial contamination. In some cases, mixed culture or aggregation of cells may make issues in the precise identification of cells, which can be overcome by cell disruption through appropriate sonication under controlled conditions. This technique is generally excellent for quick screening of organisms overproduces metabolites of interest in conjunction with fluorescent dyes. For example, Bodipy or Nile red facilitates the selection of desired mutants from a mixed population [86]. An overview of the main techniques used to establish axenic diatom cultures is presented in Table 3.
## (s24) Preparation of culture media

(p24.0) Although there are several culture media are available, but the most recommended culture media for isolation and growth of diatoms are f/2-Si, PM, and WC media. The composition of each culture media is prescribed according to the selection of diatoms for culturing for the desired application. f/2-Si culture media is widely used as the most effective media, whereas PM media is utilized for culturing diatoms in an acidic environment. WC media is generally used for culturing diatoms existing in an alkaline environment [6]. All these culture media differ in their composition of major and minor nutrients and provide proper nourishment to diatom culture. f/2-Si media is required for marine species while PM and WC media supports the cultivation of freshwater species. For marine, it is advised to prepare both media with seawater and for freshwater prepare media with distilled water [103]. The chemical composition of different culture media for diatoms cultivation are presented in Table 4.
## (s28) Future perspectives and commercial value of diatoms

(p28.0) Diatoms are very young as compared to other phytoplanktons but have evolved rapidly over some time. A decline return on investment in research and development (R&D) and slow-growing companies accelerating the demand for diatoms cultivation serving as a superfood. The term nutraceutical refers to nutrition that provides physiological benefits coupled with the protection and prevention of disease. These functional foods promote health by adding novel ingredients that are similar to conventional foods but with rich nutrition or bioactive compounds that may target the physiological mechanism of our body as characterized by the US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service [107]. On account of large content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., PUFAs n3 and n6), essential amino acids (e.g., leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and pigments (e.g., lutein and Î²-carotene) and vitamins (e.g., B12), the diatoms biomass have gained much popularity across the globe [6].
