(p2.0) As mentioned by Rashidi and Mihailidis [9] in their article, the majority of older adults prefer to stay in their homes instead of transferring to a home care facility, and therefore it is essential to create and develop new technologies that support graceful aging in place. However, vulnerable populations have unique needs and limitations. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the differences and challenges in designing and developing technologies as well as collecting data for this specific user group. Standards, guidelines, and policies play an important role, ensuring better quality and safety of new technologies. In addition, standards enable knowledge sharing and act as a mechanism to make appropriately protected knowledge public and widely accessible [10].

(p2.1) The AAL technology landscape may seem relatively new and can sometimes be confused with the Internet of Things (IoT) as both involve data acquisition from the environment using wireless technologies [11]. IoT is the extension of the internet into physical technologies and everyday objects, which enables the creation of systems that operate over a network, collecting and exchanging data, and acting upon objects in our lives [12].
