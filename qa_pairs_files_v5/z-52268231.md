(p9.0) Eight studies [4,[15][16][17][18][19][20][21] comprising 12,041 breast cancer cases investigated the association between ever-breastfeeding and breast cancer risk. The obtained results from the researches do not lead us to a unique fact. For example, some works proved that breastfeeding has a positive result on BC [4,15,17,18,20,21]. They also suggested that the duration of breastfeeding should be greater than 13 months. On contrary, some researchers found that there is not an association between the reduction of BC and breastfeeding [16,[19][20][21][22][23]]. An inverse result was reported in the studies for the association of parity and BC. Among our studies, six papers suggested that at least one parity could reduce the risk of BC while on the rest papers there is no evidence for this risk.
