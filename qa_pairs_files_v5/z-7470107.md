(p1.0) Unsupervised approaches for opinion targets identification: The unsupervised techniques has been popularly used for opinion target identification (Ben-David et al., 2007;Blitzer et al., 2007;Bloom et al., 2007;Carenini et al., 2005;Ferreira et al., 2008;Holzinger et al., 2006;Hu and Liu, 2004;Popescu et al., 2005;Wei et al., 2010;Wong and Lam, 2009;Yi et al., 2003;Zhai et al., 2011).Popescu et al. (2005) used an unsupervised technique to extract product features and opinions from unstructured reviews.This study introduces the OPINE system based on the unsupervised information extraction approach to mine product features from reviews.OPINE uses syntactic patterns for semantic orientation of words for identification of opinion phrases and their polarity.Carenini et al. (2005) developed a model based on user defined knowledge to create taxonomy of product features.This study introduces an improved unsupervised method for feature extraction that uses the taxonomy of the product features.The results of the combined approach are higher than the existing unsupervised technique; however, the pre-knowledge base mechanism makes the approach domain dependent.Holzinger et al. (2006) use domain ontologies based on tabular data from web content to bootstrap a knowledge acquisition process for extraction of product features.This method creates a wrapper for data extraction from Web tables and ontology building.The model uses logical rules and data integration to reason about product specific properties and the higher-order knowledge of product features.Bloom et al. (2007) describe an unsupervised technique for features and appraisal extraction.The authors believe that appraisal expression is a fundamental task in sentiment analysis.The appraisal expression is a textual unit expressing an evaluative attitude towards some target.Their study proposed evaluative expressions to extract opinion targets.The system effectively exploited the adjectival appraisal expressions for target identification.Ben-David et al. (2007) proposed a Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) algorithm for domain classification.The idea depends on perception to get a prediction of new domain features based on training domain features; in other words, the author describes under what conditions a classifier trained on the source domain can be adapted for use in the target domain?This model is inspired by feature based domain classification.Blitzer et al. (2007) extended the structural SCL algorithm for opinion target identification.Lu and Zhai (2008) proposed automatic integration of opinions expressed in a well-written expert review with opinions scattered in various sources such as blogs and forums.The study proposes a semi-supervised topic model to solve the problem in a principled way.The author performed experiments on integrating opinions about two quite different topics, i.e., a product and political reviews.The focus of this study is to develop a generalized model that should be effective on multiple domains for extraction of opinion targets.Ferreira et al. (2008) describe an extended pattern based feature extraction using a modified Log Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT), which was initially employed by Yi et al. (2003) for target identification.This study also presented an extended annotated scheme for product features, which was initially presented by Hu and Liu (2004) and a comparative analysis between feature extraction through Association Mining and LRT techniques.

(p1.1) The association rule mining for target extraction is initially implemented by Hu and Liu (2004) for target extraction and extended by Wei et al. (2010) using semantic based patterns for frequent feature refinement and identification of infrequent features.

(p1.2) One of the latest works on feature level analysis of opinion is reported by Zhai et al. (2011).This study describes a semi-supervised technique for feature grouping.Feature grouping is an important task for summarization of opinion.Same features can be expressed by different synonyms, words or phrases.To produce a useful summary, these words and phrases are grouped.For feature grouping the process generate an initial list to bootstrap the process using lexical characteristics of terms.This method empirically showed good results.Goujon (2011) presents a text mining approach based on linguistic knowledge to automatically detect opinion targets in relation to topic elements.This study focuses on identification of opinion targets related to the specific topic.This approach exploits linguistic patterns for target identification.

(p1.3) The two most frequently reported unsupervised approaches for target and opinion identification are Association Mining (AM) (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994) and Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) approach (Dunning, 1993).The following sub sections provide a detail overview these two approaches.

(p10.0) The other potentially employed unsupervised classification technique is the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT).The LRT was introduced by Dunning (1993) and has been reported in different NLP tasks.The LRT was employed by Yi et al. (2003) for product feature extraction and sentiment analysis.One of the latest approaches for product feature identification using the LRT technique is described by Ferreira et al. (2008).The LRT technique assumes that a feature related to the topic is explicitly presented by a noun phrase in the document using syntactic patterns associated with subjective adjectives.The overall process is explained in the Fig. 3. Yi et al. (2003) described different linguistic patterns termed as base noun phrases for candidate selection and then employs relevance scoring to refine the candidate features.The overall process of the likelihood ratio test based target extraction is defined as below.
