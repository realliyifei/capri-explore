(p1.0) Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been identified as a promising avenue to bridge the gap between seeking help and accessing mental health resources for the youth [16][17][18]. The youth are well acquainted with the use of technology [18], and mobile phone use is deeply embedded in their daily lives [19]. In addition, qualitative interviews with youth show positive perceptions of mHealth interventions for mental health needs [20]. Reviews on digital mHealth interventions for youth in general [21] and college students as a group [22] have suggested that mHealth interventions can be powerful platforms for improving the overall well-being or enhancing mental health treatments among this population. The promising effectiveness of mHealth as a means of delivering mental health interventions among the youth has led to the proliferation of digital technologies.

(p1.1) Despite these advances, the proliferation of and interest in youth-oriented mental health apps do not always directly translate to real-world outcomes. Numerous explanations exist, and a major barrier identified by Torous et al [23] is the low engagement or uptake of these digital interventions. Since engagement is often considered a prelude to the effectiveness of digital interventions, this warrants a closer examination of how end user engagement is being measured across evaluations of youth-targeted mHealth interventions. [24]. As highlighted in a recent review of this area by Pham et al [25], the unique challenges in measuring and evaluating engagement are not limited to the heterogeneous terms used in reporting engagement levels (ie, adherence, usage, feasibility, adoption, and activity) but extend to the depth and breadth of analytics metrics being selected for measurement. This creates difficulty in selecting, interpreting, comparing, and aggregating data on engagement metrics related to these youth-targeted mHealth interventions.

(p1.2) To determine the current state of engagement reporting and inform future efforts, we performed a scoping review of analytic metrics that were measured, reported, and used to inform the evaluation of youth-targeted digital mental health interventions. This study was used to inform the development of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate Thought Spot [26][27][28][29], a mobile app designed to foster mental health and wellness help-seeking in transition-aged youth across the Greater Toronto Area.
## (s8) Summarizing the Data
Number of References: 2

(p8.0) Quantitative and qualitative analyses of data were conducted. Descriptive statistics (eg, means, medians) were collected and used to characterize and describe each included paper. We identified the metrics of our included papers using a similar approach to that of another recently published review [25]. The themes were reviewed and extracted using a content analysis approach [37] to address the second research question. Two members of the research team (BL and JS) reviewed the data and ensured comprehensiveness and accuracy.
## (s14) Principal Findings

(p14.0) This scoping review explores how usage data are characterized and analyzed in evaluations of digital mental health innovations for transition-aged youth. There is an unprecedented demand to address current concerns and gaps in adolescent mental health [89,90], and the increasing ubiquity of mobile apps provides a unique opportunity to do so [91]. The recent nature of the 49 papers included in this review suggests a growing movement toward integrating analytics into mHealth evaluations [25]. In fact, the observed diversity in objectives, sample size, and duration of exposure suggests that analytics can bring value in evaluations of efficacy, effectiveness, and feasibility studies. Analytics is also of particular interest in the mental health domain because of its potential role in digital phenotyping, which is a growing area of study that explores the intersection of behavior and passively collected data [92][93][94]. As a result, understanding the value and significance of analytics can help to enhance our understanding and applications in digital psychiatry [95]. However, despite the increasing ubiquity of analytics in evaluations, the overall findings of the current review highlight several gaps in evidence [84].

(p14.1) Foremost, there was significant heterogeneity in the construct that analytics was ascribed to. For example, Bidargaddi et al [56] used the term engagement, whereas Rickhi et al [54] used the term program use, even though both studies used the number of log-ins as their usage metric. Similar variability was also found in a recent review of analytic indicators by Pham et al [25] who suggest that distinctions between certain constructs such as acceptance and engagement are emerging. Likewise, although engagement was found to be the most common construct used to describe analytics, it is not surprising because there is a significant body of literature on conceptualizing this term [25,96,97]. As such, the emerging demarcation of these terminologies will likely foster guidance on the role of analytics in measuring these constructs.
## (s15) Limitations
Number of References: 5

(p15.0) Several limitations should be noted when interpreting the findings of this scoping review. Because consumer health informatics has become popularized only over the last decade [31], we focused our review on the literature from 2008 onward. Although our findings suggest that most papers have been published within the last 6 years, it is possible that we might have missed papers outside of this window in our search strategy. In addition, due to our scope of work on Thought Spot [26,27,29], our search was limited to examining interventions designed exclusively for transition-aged youth. Because we excluded papers evaluating interventions for other populations (eg, adults) and disease sites (eg, cardiology), there may have been evidence and guidance on the use of analytics in other areas of health care [25]. Evaluating how analytics is applied in other domains of health care may provide more comprehensive insight into the role of analytics in consumer health informatics. It is also interesting to note that most of the papers included in this review were published in North America and Europe, and there was a lack of studies from other countries, including those in Asia and Africa. An evaluation of how adoption and engagement are measured in studies conducted in other countries is warranted.
