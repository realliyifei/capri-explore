(p12.0) a. Phytosome vesicles were made by thin layer rotary evaporator vacuum method. The phytosomal complex was mixed in anhydrous ethanol in 250 ml round bottom flask. The flask was attached to a rotary evaporator. The solvent will evaporate at a temperature about 60Â°C forming thin layer film around the flask. The film is hydrated by phosphate buffer having pH 7.4, and the lipid layer will peel off in phosphate buffer forming vesicle suspension. The phytosomal suspension was subjected to probe sonication with 60% amplitude. Phytosomal suspension will be stored in the refrigerator for 24 hrs, before characterization [51]. b. Phospholipid, i.e., soya lecithin was reacted with polyphenolic extract in an equal ratio with 5 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) with stirring until evaporate. Once the DCM was evaporated 5 mL of n-hexane, was added to the thin film with stirring and left in a fume hood for complete removal of the solvent. After complete removal of n-hexane, the thin film was hydrated and sonicated for desired phytosomal complex [52]. c. Weigh accurate amount of phospholipid and polyphenolic extract.
