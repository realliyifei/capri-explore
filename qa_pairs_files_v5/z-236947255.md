## (s6) H. canalicatum

(p6.0) The methanolic extract of H. canalicatum from Iran exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against several cancer cell lines, e.g., HepG-2, MCF-7, MDBK, WEHI, and A-549, with IC 50 values higher than 50 µg/mL [126]. This effect has been observed to be mainly due to the quinolinone alkaloids reported in this species. In fact, 7-isopentenyloxy-γfagarine, atanine, skimmianine, flindersine, and perfamine were singularly tested for their cytotoxic properties against several cancer cell lines, i.e., HepG-2, MCF, KG-1a, RAJI, and JURKAT, and showed good results. In this context, 7-isopentenyloxy-γ-fagarine was found to be the most active, with IC 50 values against JURKAT, RAJI, and MCF-7 of 3.6, 1.5, and 15.5 µg/mL, respectively. These values are below the positive control of doxorubicin. In addition, the other compounds have proved to be active even if with a moderate effect. Atanine was found to be more powerful than doxorubicin only against JURKAT (IC 50 = 9.3 µg/mL). Instead, skimmianine, flindersine, and perfamine were always less potent than doxorubicin against each tested cancer cell line [125]. In addition to this, two other alkaloids isolated from this species, namely acutine and hapacutine E, showed moderate in vitro antiplasmodial activity against chloroquine-sensitive Pfc (3D7 strain), with IC 50 values of 2.17 and 3.79 µM, respectively [43].
