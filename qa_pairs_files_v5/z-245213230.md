## (s6) Non-Ribosomal Synthesized Peptides (NRPs) and Polyketides (PKs)
Number of References: 7

(p6.0) NRPs and PKs include a range of cyclic, linear, and branched compounds, synthesized by composite enzymes viz. non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), polyketide synthetases (PKS), and hybrid of NRPS/PKS, respectively [22,54]. Lipopeptides (LPs) are NRPs produced by Bacillales; LPs have significant antimicrobial activity [55]. LAB is considered the primary producer of ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, as reviewed by Alvarez-Sieiro et al. [53] and Pircalabioru et al. [30]. However, the classification scheme for antimicrobial compounds produced by Bacillus is not explored in comparison to LAB. Caulier et al. [22] reviewed and updated the antimicrobial metabolites classification from the B. subtilis group based on biosynthetic pathway and chemical nature. Zhao et al. [21] acknowledged 31 types of PKs, NRPs, and NRPS/PKS hybrid synthesized antimicrobials using antiSMASH.

(p12.0) Archaeocins, is a proteinaceous antibiotic produced from archaea which mark the chronicled beginning in the series of antimicrobial compounds. The term "archaeocin" was used to differentiate the archaeal peptide and protein-based antibiotics from those produced by bacteria [95]. Only two phylogenetic groups have produced archaeocins (Table 4); one is euryarchaeal producing "halocins", whereas the other group is crenarchaeal genus Sulfolobus producing "sulfolobicin" [96]. Valera et al. [97] reported halocins, the first proteinaceous antimicrobial compound from halophilic members of the archaeal domain. Archaeal protein VLL-28, from Sulfolobus islandicus, is the first archaeal antimicrobial peptide, possessing a broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activity [98]. Until recently, very few reports were available on the characterization of antimicrobial compounds from archaea. Besse et al. [99] comprehensively reviewed the archaeocins and sul-Antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activity [90] Streptomyces sp. YIM66017

(p17.0) In 1929, Alexander Fleming discovered the mold juice 'Penicillin' from Penicillium notatum fungus with an antibacterial activity [120]. Afterwards, several researchers started to search for a better strain to attain higher yields in easier growth conditions. After extensive research, Penicillium chrysogenum strains were considered for the commercial production of penicillin [121]. Revilla reported in 1986 the formation of the intermediate isopenicillin N in the course of penicillin G production in P. chrysogenum cultures [122], thereafter the formation of isopenicillin N/penicillin N and its late transformation to cephalosporin C in Acremonium chrysogenum [123]. Cephalosporins, a known antimicrobial agent, were purified from a marine fungus, Cephalosporium acremonium [124]. Recently, Li et al. [125] reported that pneumocandins, a lipohexapeptides of the echinocandin family, were produced by wild-type fungi Glarea lozoyensis and Pezicula (Cryptosporiopsis) species. Pneumocandins non-competitively bind to a catalytic unit of β-1,3-glucan synthase, resulting in osmotic uncertainty and cell lysis.

(p18.0) Huang et al. [126] discovered ten-membered lactones from endophytic fungus Phomopsis sp. YM 311483, with antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Fusarium, and Botrytis cinere. Endophytic Fusarium sp. from Selaginella pollescens collected from the Guanacaste conservation area of Costa Rica inhibit C. albicans [127]. The number of antimicrobial compounds were reported from the endophytic fungi, some of which are listed in Table 5. produced by other domains. Nowadays, when archaea gain more attention, it becomes necessary to explore their metabolites', biosynthetic pathways, mode of action, etc., using the latest available technology.

(p23.0) In 2015 Meng et al. [133] discovered pyranonigrin F from fungus Penicillium brocae MA-231 allied with the Avicennia marina, a marine mangrove plant. Pyranonigrin F inhibits S. aureus (Gram-positive), Vibrio harveyi, and Vibrio parahemolyticus (Gram-negative bacteria), with considerably lower MIC values in comparison to the positive control (chloromycetin). Likewise, it is active against plant fungal pathogens Alternaria brassicae and Colletotrichum gloeosprioides, with improved MIC values compared to the positive control (bleomycin). Wu et al. [134] discovered Lindgomycin from Lindgomyces strains LF327 and KF970, reported from a sponge in the Baltic Sea, Germany, and Antarctica, respectively. Lindgomycin displayed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE). However, the inhibiting potential was two times less than the positive control chloramphenicol. It also constrains plant pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. There is a never-ending list of antimicrobial compounds from marine fungi; a few of which are listed in Table 6, which displays their host, producer species, and bioactivity.

(p28.0) Marine sponge Callyspongia sp. [154] Peniciadametizine A and Peniciadametizine B derivative of thiolated diketopiperazine was isolated from sponges-associated Penicillium sp. viz. Penicillium adametzioides AS-53 and Penicillium sp. LS54, respectively. Both derivatives inhibit A. brassicae (pathogenic fungus) with a MIC of 4.0 µg/mL and 32.0 µg/mL, respectively [138]. Communol A, G, and F extracted from P. commune 518 displayed antibacterial activities against E. coli with MIC values of 4.1, 23.8, and 6.4µM, respectively, and also against E. aerogenes [136]. Pyrrospirones were produced by marine-derived fungus Penicillium sp. ZZ380, isolated from Pachygrapsus crassipes which is a wild crab found on the seaside rocks of Putuo Mountain (Zhoushan, China). Pyrrospirones C-F, H, and I inhibit MRSA and E. coli having MIC values of 2.0-19.0 µg/mL [155]. Song et al. [156], following the previous lead, separated penicipyrrodiether A from a cultured marine fungal strain Penicillium sp. ZZ380 which inhibits E. coli and S. aureus with MIC of 34.0 and 5.0 µg/mL, respectively. These laboratory studies need to be directed toward developing the efficiency and effectiveness of isolated compounds that could benefit society in the long-term.

(p30.0) Yeasts mainly occur in milk, meat, food, and products such as fruit, yogurt, jams, sausage, and cheeses. Generally, antimicrobial compounds produced from yeasts inhibit the evolution/growth of pathogenic organisms (bacteria or molds) in food products. Some classes of yeasts secrete toxins, thereby naming them killer yeasts. Killer yeasts naturally occur in rotten vegetables and fruits and constrain the growth of other yeast strains and also inhibit microbial growth [167]. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), unicellular yeast, is the most widely studied microorganisms involved in many biotechnological practices because of its good fermentation capacity [168]. The inhibitory mechanism of S. cerevisiae killer strains was discovered in 1963 by Bevan and co-worker's, and the phenomenon is related to the secretion of a protein toxin, k1, and k28 from the host that kills sensitive target pathogenic cells in a receptor-mediated approach without direct cell-to-cell contact [169]. Other genera producing killer toxins include Cryptococcus, Candida, Kluyveromyces, Williopsis, Pichia, Debaromyces, and Zygosaccharomyces [170]. The anti-bacterial capability of S. cerevisiae is attributed to: Sequential re-pitching of Saccharomyces biomass is a common process during brewing. Therefore, yeast is reused many times before its final dumping [171]. Hence, yeast develops an adaptive response against oxidative stress like that of human cells, leading to the accumulation of vitamins (B6 and B12) and minerals (enzyme co-factors including zinc, manganese, and copper) in the yeast cell. Phenolic compounds are also adsorbed by Saccharomyces from the exterior medium, which increases the phenolic content and antioxidant activity within yeast cells [172]. Efficient means are required to disrupt yeast cell walls and separate the products of interest, which are further used for food applications. However, increasing consumer' fears regarding the toxicity of killer yeast strains present in food and milk products constitutes a direct risk to public health.
