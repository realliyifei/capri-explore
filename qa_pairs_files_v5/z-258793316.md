## (s5) Colostrum Analysis
Number of References: 5

(p5.0) The bovine colostrum quality can be estimated by the colostrometer, a device that measures the specific gravity related to the total gamma-globulin concentration and enables an estimation of quantity on the basis of a statistical correlation. In the buffalo, a nonsignificant correlation between the specific gravity and total gamma-globulin was seen [72]. The reason lies in the different colostrum composition between cow and buffalo colostrum, with higher concentrations of fat and proteins in buffalo colostrum that may affect the colostrometer readings. Within all parameters evaluated as possible markers for buffalo colostral quality, the enzyme GGT appeared with the highest correlation observed between its activity and the concentrations of gamma globulins [73,74].

(p5.1) The enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase is a cell membrane-bound enzyme located on the outer surface of cell membranes. It transports and uses glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide with antioxidant action, as a source of amino acids for cell metabolism [74]. Results of Pero et al. [74], showed that glutathione is secreted in buffalo colostrum and that the enzyme GGT uses it as a substrate for its activity.
## (s6) Passive Immunity Transfer (PIT)

(p6.0) The calf must acquire passive immunity via colostrum [47]. The timing of colostrum intake, the method, and volume of colostrum administration, the presence of the mother, as well as respiratory acidosis of the newly born, are linked to its absorption in calves [93]. Colostrum antibodies can protect the calf for up to six weeks. During this period, in the environment, the animal contacts infectious agents, which gradually stimulate the development of its immune system [28]. If the calf does not receive colostral immunoglobulins, is highly exposed to diseases, and this can even cause a high mortality rate of calves on the farm [94,95]. The onset of immunocompetence (active immunity) occurs after three weeks of age, when the passive coverage of the antibodies taken up via colostrum begins to decrease [96].
