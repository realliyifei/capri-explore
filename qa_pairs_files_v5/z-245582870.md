Number of References: 7

(p3.0) Bupleurum chinense is a perennial herb belonging to the Umbelliferae family (9). Bupleurum chinense is widely used in TCM because of its multiple pharmacological effects. In TCM, Radix Bupleuri, the dried root of Bupleurum chinense, has been employed for more than two thousand years in China (10). According to modern pharmacological studies, Radix Bupleuri possesses a wide range of bioactive properties, including antipyretic, antiinflammatory, hepatoprotective, antibacterial, antiviral, immune regulation, and antiplatelet agglutination functions (11). Among the complex constituents of Radix Bupleuri, saikosaponins have been identified as the major biologically active constituents using modern techniques (12).  pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antioxidant, antiulcer, hepatoprogenic, and neuroprotective activities (25)(26)(27).
## (s5) Isatis indigotica
Number of References: 5

(p5.0) Isatis indigotica is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cruciferae family (28). Isatis indigotica is distributed across China, and Radix Isatidis, the dried roots of Isatis indigotica, are widely employed in the prevention and treatment of a wide range of viral infections, including fever, influenza, epidemic hepatitis, and bacterial infection for thousands of years (29). Based on recent clinical data, Radix Isatidis has clinical effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1-influenza (30,31). Numerous phytochemical studies have led to the isolation of valuable bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, glucosinolates, carotenoids, volatile constituents, and fatty acids, among which alkaloids are the dominant compounds (29). Owing to numerous studies, these ingredients have been identified to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects (32-34).
## (s6) Patrinia scabiosaefolia
Number of References: 4

(p6.0) Patrinia scabiosaefolia is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Valerianaceae family. Patrinia scabiosaefolia is a Chinese herbal medicine with high nutritional and medicinal value, and is mainly distributed in mainland China (35). Modern pharmacological studies have shown that Patrinia scabiosaefolia has various effects, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-pathogenic, anti-oxidation, sedation, and hypnosis (36). According to previous phytochemical investigations, this genus contains a variety of components, including triterpenes, iridoids, saponins, sesquiterpenes, flavonoids, coumarins, and lignans (37). Among them, triterpenoid aglycones and triterpenoid saponins are considered the main active constituents of Patrinia scabiosaefolia (36). Typical representatives of triterpenoid aglycones in Patrinia scabiosaefolia include ursolic acid, hederagenin, and oleanolic acid.
## (s8) Fallopia japonica
Number of References: 6

(p8.0) Fallopia japonica is a perennial herb belonging to the Polygonaceae family (13). Fallopia japonica, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is widely distributed in southern China and Japan. According to numerous studies, the root of Fallopia japonica has a wide range of pharmacological activities, including lipidregulating, anti-shock, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects (14)(15)(16). More than 67 chemical compounds have been isolated from Fallopia japonica, and its major components have been determined to be quinones, stilbenes, flavonoids, counmarins, and ligans (13). Among the chemical compounds, resveratrol, piceid, and emodin have been found to exhibit various biological activities. Resveratrol and piceid have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-aging, and cardioprotective properties (17). Emodin has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antineoplastic activities (18-20).
## (s9) Forsythia suspensa
Number of References: 4

(p9.0) Forsythia suspensa is a flowering plant belonging to the Oleaceae family (21). Forsythia suspensa is widely distributed in China, Southeast Asia, and many European countries (22). Fructus Forsythiae, the seeds of Forsythia suspensa, exhibits high pharmacological activity and is documented in every edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. In fact, a total of 114 Chinese medicinal preparations containing Fructus Forsythiae are listed in the 2015 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Based on modern pharmacological studies, Fructus Forsythiae exerts anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-allergy, and neuroprotective effects (23). To date, approximately 210 compounds have been identified from Forsythia suspensa, including phenylethanoid glycosides, lignans, flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenoids, cyclohexylethanol derivatives, and others (23). Among them, lignans and phenylethanoid glycosides, such as forsythiaside, phillyrin, rutin, and phillygenin, are considered the characteristic and active constituents of this herb (23).
## (s16) Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities of SFJDC
Number of References: 5

(p16.0) The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of SFJDC have been demonstrated in several studies. Some active compounds of SFJDC, including forsythiaside (61), vitexin (62), and emodin (63), have been reported to possess anti-inflammatory effects. Tao et al. used an LPS-induced ALI rat model to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of SFJDC (64). Based on the results, SFJDC can alleviate LPS-induced stress injury and inhibit inflammation in lung tissue by suppressing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway (64). Recently, target prediction and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) based on transcriptome analysis have been used to clarify the inflammation-eliminating mechanism of SFJDC (65). According to the results, various ingredients of SFJDC, especially verbenalin, phillyrin, and emodin, could ameliorate Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced acute lung injury, among which the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway was identified as a key pathway related to its anti-inflammatory effect (65). Similarly, airway inflammation and lung injury in IAV-infected rats could be controlled by the combination of SFJDC and oseltamivir by modulating the nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and subsequently downregulating interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 levels (54).
