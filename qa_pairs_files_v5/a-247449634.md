## (s6) Arterial fibrillation (AF)
Number of References: 4

(p6.0) AF is the most typical cardiac arrhythmia worldwide. 77 Inflammation is known to have a potential role in AF development. 78 About AF and periodontal disease, there are limited studies which found out this relationship. Chen et al. conducted a cohort study and concluded that there was an increased risk of AF or flutter in the periodontal disease group compared with the patients without the periodontal disease. 79 Chang et al. conducted another study among 161286 subjects from the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) which had no medical history of AF, HF, or cardiac valvular diseases. To assess oral hygiene, they evaluated the presence of periodontal disease, any dental visit, number of missing teeth, etc. They concluded that oral hygiene enhancement resulted in decreasing the risk of AF. They also suggested that subjects with good oral hygiene might have a reduced risk of AF. 80 About the other types of arrhythmia, there are not enough studies that assess this association with periodontal disease.

LLM judge: YES

How does periodontal disease affect the risk of atrial fibrillation, and what evidence supports this relationship?
