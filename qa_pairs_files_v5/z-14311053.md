(p3.0) Categorical and dose-response meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models to account for between-study heterogeneity [18]. Summary relative risks (RRs) were estimated using the average of the natural logarithm of the RRs of each study weighted by the inverse of the variance and then unweighted by applying a random-effects variance component which is derived from the extent of variability of the effect sizes of the studies. The maximally adjusted RR estimates were used for the meta-analysis except for the follow-up of randomised, controlled trials [19,20] where unadjusted results were also included, as these studies mostly involved a more homogeneous study population. BMI or Quetelet's Index (QI) measured in units of kg/m 2 was used.

(p3.1) We conducted categorical meta-analyses by pooling the categorical results reported in the studies. The studies used different BMI categories. In some studies, underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m 2 according to WHO international classification) and normal weight women (BMI 18.5-<25.0 kg/m 2 ) were classified together but, in some studies, they were classified separately. Similarly, most studies classified overweight (BMI 25.0-<30.0 kg/m 2 ) and obese (BMI â‰¥30.0 kg/m 2 ) women separately but, in some studies, overweight and obese women were combined. The reference category was normal weight or underweight together with normal weight, depending on the studies. For convenience, the BMI categories are referred to as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese in the present review. We derived the RRs for overweight and obese women compared with normal weight women in two studies [19,21] that had more than four BMI categories using the method of Hamling et al. [22]. Studies that reported results for obese compared with nonobese women were analysed separately.

(p3.2) The non-linear dose-response relationship between BMI and mortality was examined using the best-fitting second-order fractional polynomial regression model [23], defined as the one with the lowest deviance. Nonlinearity was tested using the likelihood ratio test [24]. In the non-linear meta-analysis, the reference category was the lowest BMI category in each study and RRs were recalculated using the method of Hamling et al. [22] when the reference category was not the lowest BMI category in the study.

(p3.3) We also conducted linear dose-response meta-analyses, excluding the category underweight when reported separately in the studies, by pooling estimates of RR per unit increase (with its standard error) provided by the studies, or derived by us from categorical data using generalised least-squares for trend estimation [25]. To estimate the trend, the numbers of outcomes and population at-risk for at least three BMI categories, or the information required to derive them using standard methods [26], and means or medians of the BMI categories, or if not reported in the studies, the estimated midpoints of the categories had to be available. When the extreme BMI categories were open-ended, we used the width of the adjacent close-ended category to estimate the midpoints. Where the RRs were presented by subgroups (age group [27], menopausal status [28,29], stage [30] or subtype [31] of breast cancer, or others [32][33][34]), an overall estimate for the study was obtained by a fixedeffect model before pooling in the meta-analysis. We estimated the risk increase of death for an increment of 5 kg/m 2 of BMI.
