(p1.0) Activation of irrigants is one of the key stages in the medication-based treatment of root canals, which involves achieving the solution's penetration into all areas of the root canal and enhancing its antimicrobial activity. Therefore, various methods of irrigant activation have been developed to improve their effectiveness. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is the most commonly used irrigant, which possesses proteolytic properties towards pulp tissue, exhibits excellent antimicrobial properties, and affects biofilm. However, it poorly removes any accumulated remnants of hard tissues. Therefore, it is used in combination with demineralizing/chelating solutions to remove the smearing layer and dentin debris, typically using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) [1][2][3].
