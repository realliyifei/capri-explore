(p29.0) This method, which is a kind of secondary triage, has four stages and a numerical system ( Figure 19). In this method of triage, patients are tagged according to the score obtained. If the number is 10 or less, the injured individual is placed at the red class, and if the number is equal to 11, he will be placed in the yellow class. A patient with 12 scores will be categorised in the green class [15].  (Smith, 2012) [15] Hospital Triage
