(p13.0) In data-intensive computing, it is crucial to generate an efficient execution plan based on properties of code, data and platform. It may lead to a poor performance by using a fixed priori experience about these properties to determine execution plans, as most current platforms do. Moreover, it is difficult to extract and estimate these properties according to the highly distributed nature of data-intensive computing frameworks and the freedom that allows users to use UDF to represent a series of data operations. In [1], a framework, namely RoPE (Reoptimizer for Parallel Executions), is proposed to collect code and data properties by piggybacking on job execution. Then it determines execution plans by feeding these properties to a query optimizer component. In [27], a framework called MANIMAl automatically analyzes MapReduce programs and applies appropriate data-aware optimizations to the programs.
