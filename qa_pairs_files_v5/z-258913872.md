## (s3) PI3K/AKT
Number of References: 4

(p3.0) The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway is a significant signaling pathway in cell signaling. mTOR is a common downstream protein of AKT, which can integrate various extracellular signals such as nutrients, energy, and growth factors, and participates in gene transcription, protein translation, ribosome synthesis, and other biological processes [37]. It also plays an important role in cell growth, apoptosis, autophagy, and metabolism [38]. In OS of GCs, the regulation of cell survival by AKT also involves the direct inhibition of FOXO phosphorylation [39]. Meanwhile, the PI3K/AKT pathway can regulate the expression of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2), which in turn regulates GC proliferation [40].
## (s4) MAPK

(p4.0) The MAPK signaling pathway is one of the crucial pathways in the eukaryotic signaling network. It is a critical signaling pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress response under normal and pathological conditions [56]. MAPK can be divided into four subfamilies: ERK, p38, JNK, and BMK1 (ERK5), representing the four classical MAPK pathways. Under normal conditions, mTOR inhibits phosphorylates Atg13 after being activated in the AKT and MAPK signaling pathway, preventing it from interacting with ULK1 and ULK2, and the autophagic response is suppressed [57]. In OS, ROS activates the ASK1 signalosome in the MAPK pathway, which activates its downstream JNK and p38-MAPK pathways, further activating p53 and FOXO, and thereby activating and inhibiting its downstream proapoptotic and antiapoptotic molecules and their regulators [58][59][60].
## (s5) FOXO Axis
Number of References: 6

(p5.0) The forkhead box transcription factors class O (FOXO) is an essential regulator of various intracellular processes. FOXO1, FOXO3a, and other family members are involved in regulating important processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle, stress resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammation [65]. ROS and other stress stimuli capable of producing ROS can regulate FOXO activation and gene expression at multiple levels [66]. On the one hand, FOXO expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, such as by acting on the upstream regulatory protein of FOXO-like p53 and affecting the regulation of its mRNA by miRNA and HuR. On the other hand, it can also affect the activity, stability, and binding of FOXO to DNA through phosphorylation and acetylation. In addition, ROS can also regulate the activation of FOXO proteins by affecting FOXO transcriptional co-activators. In some pathological conditions related to OS, FOXO overactivation and overexpression can lead to the development of various diseases, such as cancer and diabetes [67]. In the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway, AMPK enhances the expression level of SIRT1 by increasing NAD+ concentration, while SIRT1 regulates apoptosis and autophagy by increasing its transcriptional activity through catalyzing the deacetylation of FOXO1 [68]. mTOR can also be inhibited by the AMPK signaling pathway, leading to the activation of the autophagic response. It has been shown that grape seed proanthocyanidins can activate SIRT1 signaling, leading to the deacetylation of the FOXO1 gene, thus counteracting OS in human GCs and alleviating their autophagy [69,70].
## (s12) Sulforaphane
Number of References: 7

(p12.0) Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate derived from glucoraphanin, is mainly found in cruciferous plants such as radishes, cabbage, broccoli, and other vegetables [124]. Sulforaphane is a common antioxidant that has been found to affect NFE2L2 and to regulate phase II enzymes, and its potential therapeutic effects on cancer have led to a great deal of research interest [125]. It has been suggested that sulforaphane may protect GCs of patients with PCOS from OS by activating the AMPK/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway and reducing the levels of ROS and apoptosis [97]. Sohel et al. [126] used bovine GCs treated with varying concentrations of sulforaphane and found that the expression of Nrf2 was markedly elevated in sulforaphane-treated GCs. The antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects, however, were dependent on the concentration of sulforaphane used, and it was observed that high concentrations of sulforaphane (20 ÂµM) may increase apoptosis under oxidative stress; in a follow-up study, Sohel et al. [127] also found that sulforaphane pretreatment could activate the Nrf2-ARE pathway and thus effectively protect bovine GCs from oxidative damage. Recently, Zhang et al. [106] showed that sulforaphane could activate the transcription factor of NFE2L2 within the nucleus, which increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes and induced mitophagy, demonstrating that sulforaphane could attenuate hypoxia-induced apoptosis in GCs through the study of a sulforaphane-treated porcine GCs hypoxia model; in other experiments, sulforaphane was also seen to protect human GCs from OS by increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and CAT through Nrf2 and reducing ROS production and apoptosis [80].
