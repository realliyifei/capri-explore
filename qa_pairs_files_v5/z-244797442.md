## (s3) Hydrogel-Based Cell Encapsulation, Protoplast Regeneration as Use Case for Plant Cells
Number of References: 4

(p3.0) A key motivation behind the utilization of hydrogel encapsulation methods in plant sciences are aimed at fundamental studies on processes associated with cell and tissue regeneration, which include the recovery of cell walls, reentry of cell cycles, formation of calli, acquisition of pluripotency, and de novo tissue regeneration [26]. Specifically, cells do not have high proliferation in liquid suspension cultures and are also not an adequate platform for studying the molecular mechanisms that influence the regeneration of cells [27]. Hydrogel encapsulation within thin alginate layers and thin alginate films (thickness < 10 μm) have been utilized for the immobilization of Daucus carota protoplasts. This allowed for the study of the effects of various culture conditions on the embryogenesis of these protoplasts [28]. Sinha and Caligari have shown the enhanced rate of protoplast division of recalcitrant lupin protoplasts when encapsulated within hydrogel droplets when compared to suspension cultures [22]. Specifically, protoplasts were isolated from cotyledons of two-week-old Lupinus albus 2

(p5.0) While the aforementioned studies show the potential of utilizing hydrogel encapsulation as a tool for plant cell culture, there are some critical disadvantages associated with the technique that need to be considered. For instance, hydrogel encapsulation may potentially hinder downstream processes such as transcriptomic profiling due to the need to release encapsulated cells. This may require additional enzymatic degradation of the bulk matrix, such as agarases on agarose-derived hydrogels [35], or collagenases on collagen-derived hydrogels [36]. The release of encapsulated cells may also be facilitated by utilizing reversible crosslinking methods, which may allow for relatively simple liquefaction of crosslinked hydrogels. For instance, alginates are crosslinked using ionic crosslinking strategies, which are reversible by using calcium chelators such as sodium citrate [37]. Similarly, thermally crosslinked gelatin, and other related hydrogels, can be liquefied by simply varying the external temperature to the liquefaction temperature [38]. However, changes in temperature outside of an optimal window is known to cause changes in gene expression in protoplasts [39], and this must be considered before utilizing temperature-based liquefaction methods. One of the key motivations behind using hydrogel encapsulation is being able to achieve high rates of cell division in encapsulated protoplasts and cells. However, the presence of a solid matrix may also hinder the rate of division and proliferation of some protoplasts of some species. For instance, Chrysanthemum indicum protoplasts have been documented to have significantly higher rates of proliferation in liquid culture when compared to hydrogel encapsulation. This may also be potentially due to accumulation of cellular waste within the hydrogel matrices [40]. Similarly, regeneration of plants from Populus×beijingensis was also found to be significantly higher in liquid culture, due to the ability to easily replenish fresh media. This allows for the reduction of medium osmolarity while also supplying new nutrients for the cells, which in turn can enhance division frequency [41]. Similar results were observed in the cultivation of Kalanchoe blossfeldiana protoplasts for plant regeneration, with the liquid culture offering a more direct approach to replenishing nutrients [42], and in the culture of leaf-and calli-derived protoplasts of Albizia julibrissin which showed improved division and regeneration in liquid suspension as opposed to hydrogel encapsulation in agar [43]. Thus, cases such as these may require the utilization of additional media supplantation around hydrogel constructs in order to dilute such molecules.
