(p8.0) Heavy metal pollution perturbs the environment, inhibits plant growth and development, and seriously threatens human health. SNPs have an important role in reducing the toxic effects of heavy metals, such as chromium [23], cadmium [103][104][105], mercury [106], lead [107], and aluminum [17] on plants. Chen et al. (2018) found that 5-25 mM SNPs (60-100 nm) decreased the cadmium content of rice by 31.6-64.9% at the flowering stage [108]. SNPs could reduce aluminum toxicity in Cicer arietinum plants by promoting seed germination and plant growth [109].

(p8.1) SNPs enhance plant resistance to heavy metals by reducing the accumulation of heavy metals and oxidative stress and activating plant defense systems [17,23,109]. Heavy metal stress induces oxidative stress, leading to the accumulation of ROS, such as superoxide (O −2 ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and hydroxyl radical (OH − ), which severely damage the structure, organelles, and functions of plant cells [110,111]. SNPs could activate the antioxidant defense system in roots and leaves, thereby decreasing ROS accumulation in the plant [104,105]. Tripathi et al. (2016) found that SNPs application significantly increases the activity of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and dehydro-ascorbate reductase in maize leaves under arsenic stress [112]. Moreover, glutathione (GSH) is an antioxidant and is crucial for detoxification of heavy metals, which could remove ROS and is a substrate for phytochelatin synthesis [113]. SNPs treatment increases GSH levels to alleviate cadmium toxicity in rice [104]. Under Cd stress, the combination of Si and NO activates the antioxidant defense system of plants by regulating the ascorbic acid-GSH pathway and markers related to oxidative stress in wheat [114]. Tripathi et al. (2016) demonstrated that SNPs application decreases the toxic effects of arsenate on the growth and development of maize by enhancing the components of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle [112]. Furthermore, some specific compounds (e.g., organic acids and phenolic) could chelate metal and scavenge active oxygen under heavy metal stress [115,116]. SNPs enhance maize's resistance to aluminum toxicity by increasing the accumulation of organic acids (e.g., citrate, lactate, malate, and succinate) and phenols in the roots [17]. Besides, SNPs decrease heavy metal accumulation in plants and restrict the heavy metal stress by promoting photosynthesis, plant growth, and silicon absorbing [117]. Similar results were found in wheat [105]. Moreover, SNPs inhibit the expression of some heavy metal transport and accumulation genes such as OsLCT1 and OsNramp5, which reduce the absorption and accumulation of the heavy metal in the plant [24].
