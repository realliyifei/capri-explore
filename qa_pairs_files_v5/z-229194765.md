## (s2) Method of in vivo absorption: single-pass intestinal perfusion model and absorption calculations
Number of References: 8

(p2.0) This review discusses mainly data from the rat and pig single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) models in relation to other relevant in vivo data [50][51][52][53]. The SPIP model has been extensively used in preclinical studies to investigate and determine epithelial effective intestinal permeability (P eff ), as well as other absorption parameters for drugs and drug delivery systems, such as suspensions and lipid-based ones ( Figure 2). Intestinal P eff , absorption flux (J app ), and fraction dose absorbed (f abs ) are the three key biopharmaceutical variables that describe the absorption and transport properties of a drug across the intestinal barrier in the SPIP model [3,54]. This model is used to investigate oral drug delivery and characterize pre-formulations, as part of the development process of a pharmaceutical product. The SPIP model is also useful for investigating regional intestinal permeability and transport mechanisms involved during in vivo-relevant conditions, and for determining the BCS classification of any API [54]. This model is also used to investigate the interplay between in vivo dissolution of various dosage forms, such as nanoformulations and various pharmaceutical excipients, and intestinal permeability, during both fed and fasted conditions [55]. 2) a syringe pump allows coadministration of e.g., enzymes; 3) perfusate is collected after passing through an intestinal segment; 4) blood sampling from the femoral artery; 5) body temperature is monitored using a rectal probe, connected to a heating pad; 6) blood pressure and heart rate are monitored in the femoral artery.
## (s6) Danazol and cyclosporine

(p6.0) Intestinal absorption mechanisms have been investigated in fed and fasted states in a pig SPIP model for low solubility APIs as monomers or nanoparticles. Nanoparticle suspensions of two BCS class II model drugs, danazol and cyclosporine (CyA), were single-pass perfused through the pig jejunum in isotonic buffer alone (control) and isotonic buffer with verapamil, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, or in isotonic buffer containing dietary and intestinal lipids. Co-administration of CyA and verapamil increased the jejunal P eff of CyA from 0.63 ± 0.05 · 10 -4 cm/s to 1.01 ± 0.09 · 10 -4 cm/s [55]. The human jejunal P eff for CyA was 1.65 ± 0.53 · 10 -4 cm/s, when determined with the perfusion method, which classifies CyA as a low solubility-high permeability Class II BCS drug. CyA is well-recognized to have highly variable absorption from approved oral formulations because of poor dissolution [54,79,80]. When dietary lipids were introduced to the perfused segment in the SPIP model, they reduced the jejunal absorption of a CyA as a saturated solution and nanosuspension by approximately 50 % and 83 %, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, dietary lipids increased the jejunal absorption of danazol nanosuspensions more than two-fold. However, f abs was reduced by 60 % when danazol was administered as a solution in the same media (Table 4). This difference for nanosuspensions and monomer solutions of danazol is most likely due to increased dissolution and/or a more efficient transport of the danazol nanoparticles (150 nm) than the CyA (650 nm) through the particle ABL. The difference in the effect of intraluminal lipids may also be explained by different distribution of any of the study drugs to the colloidal structures present in the media. These structures affect the convective and diffusion rates of the drugs differently in the perfused segment. CyA has a higher partitioning (2.5 times) to the colloidal structures than danazol. Based on previous observations, danazol probably partitions primarily to the mixed intraluminal micelles, and to a lesser extent to the lipid vesicles [55].
## (s8) Fenofibrate and other drugs

(p8.0) In contrast to these absorption-promoting results for nanoparticles aprepitant and danazol in both fasted and fed conditions in the SPIP model, only the fed state reduces the intestinal absorption of nanosized drugs such as fenofibrate, CsA, pafenolol [37,55,83,84]. In a regional absorption study in humans with a site-specific delivery system (Enterion capsule), fenofibrate were given as single, equimolar doses into the stomach, proximal small bowel, distal small bowel, and colon. The bioavailability (related to an intravenous dose of fenofibric acid) in the stomach, proximal small bowel, distal small bowel, and colon was 69 %, 73 [85]. This clearly shows that fenofibrate is absorbed from the small intestine. However, the solubility and dissolution conditions in the colon-less fluid and limited amounts of bile acids and colloidal structures-prevent efficient fenofibrate absorption from this region.
