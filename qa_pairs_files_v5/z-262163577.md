(p21.0) The distinction between preprogramming and real-time programming of the common planning algorithms depends on whether the environment map is known or unknown. Many studies based on structured environments have been conducted in the past, which suggests that CMIM might accomplish localization and navigation by preprogramming. Industry 4.0's trend has evolved into a more adaptable mechanism, allowing the system to update the map concurrently and therefore improve efficiency. SLAM, or simultaneous localization and mapping, is a popular method for structuring the world at the same time. In tandem with SLAM's real-time mapping, vision-based line tracking, an element of the "Guided" driving approach, offers an intermediate degree of autonomy. This technique allows mobile robots to follow predetermined paths using visual cues, especially in environments with set structures [47]. Campbell et al. [48] detailed several robot localization methods, including GPS (satellite-based), odometry (wheel rotation measurement), inertial navigation systems (INS, without initial reference but prone to errors), and map-based location.
