(p11.0) Prior to the discovery of antibiotics, efforts were made to treat patients using bacteriophages. Bacteriophages have two life cycles, lysogenic and lytic, which may be used in therapeutics. Bacteriophages are characterized by their specificity, which allows them to selectively work against certain bacteria while having no negative effects on the surrounding flora, which is crucial for the advancement of human health. On the other hand, this uniqueness causes certain issues with phage therapy's immunity problem and also necessitates very specialized techniques (Bragg et al., 2014;Hashempour-Baltork et al., 2019;Lin et al., 2017). The potential to decrease Campylobacter adulteration of numerous foods has been investigated for some of the Campylobacter bacteriophages that have been inaccessible from chickens, counting their feces and the surface and internal tissues of their livers (Hammerl et al., 2014). For instance, Hammerl and colleagues discovered a significant reduction (3 logs) in Campylobacter fecal levels when two phages were delivered consecutively to 20-day-old chicks (a Group III phage, then a Group II phage). It's noteworthy to note that the Group III phage was unsuccessful when given unaided or in combination through additional Group III phage, signifying that a mix of Group II and III phages was obligatory for maximal efficiency. Campylobacter-specific phages have previously been isolated from a small number of Campylobacter isolates, with many investigations using the single isolate of C. jejuni NCTC 12662
