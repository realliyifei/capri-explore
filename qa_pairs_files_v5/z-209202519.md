(p15.0) In multiple-instance learning (MIL), data is grouped in clusters, called as bags, and each bag is labeled as positive if there is at least one positive instance in it and negative otherwise. Network is fed with group of data and produces a single prediction for each bag by learning inner discriminative representation of data. Since group of images are used and one prediction is produced, existence of noisy labels along with true labels in a bag has less impact on learning. In [114] authors propose to effectively choose training samples from each bag by minimizing the total bag level loss to train noise robust classifiers. Extra model is trained in [115] as attention model, which chooses parts of the images to be focused on. Aim is to focus on few regions on correctly labeled image and not focus on any region for mislabeled images.
