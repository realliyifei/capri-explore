(p6.0) The tabu search (TS) algorithm proposed in [8] adapts the tabu algorithm designed for the classic vertex coloring problem [13,20]. It starts with a random coloring and visits both proper and improper colorings with the neighborhood N Oneâˆ’move induced by the One-move operator. If there exist conflicting vertices, TS chooses a best move (according to its evaluation function f p ) to change the color of a conflicting vertex. Otherwise, TS picks a (non-conflicting) vertex and change its color at random. The above steps are repeated until a stopping criterion is satisfied. This algorithm relies simply on the tabu list for its diversification and does not call for other perturbation mechanism. This algorithm only showed limited computational results.
