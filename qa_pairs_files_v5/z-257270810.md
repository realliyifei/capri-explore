(p9.0) Several studies have shown the effectiveness of paraphrasing as a strategy for improving reading and writing skills in the ESL/EFL classroom. For example, Khoshsima & Rezaeian 2014(2011 found that paraphrasing activities helped students to better understand the main ideas and supporting details of a text, and to use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures in their writing. Similarly, (Choy & Lee, 2012). found that paraphrasing activities helped students to improve their comprehension and writing skills, and to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the content of the texts they read.

(p9.1) Paraphrasing is a useful skill that can help students improve both their reading and writing abilities in the ESL/EFL classroom. Paraphrasing involves restating a text in one's own words, while retaining the original meaning and intention of the text (Choy & Lee, 2012). It is a valuable technique for developing reading comprehension skills, as students must identify and understand the key ideas and supporting details of the text in order to rephrase them in their own words. Paraphrasing also enhances students' writing skills, as they must use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures to convey the meaning of the original text (Na & Nhat, 2017;Flores & Lopez, 2019;Yahia & Egbert, 2023).

(p9.2) One effective way for teachers to incorporate paraphrasing into their ESL/EFL lessons is to provide short reading texts for students to practice with. These texts can be selected based on the students' proficiency level, and can range from simple news articles to more complex academic papers (Hirvela & Du, 2013;Chen, et al., 2015;Ruslan, et al., 2020). Students can then be asked to paraphrase the text in their own words, using appropriate vocabulary and grammar. This activity can help students develop their ability to identify the main idea and important supporting sentences in each paragraph of the text, which is essential for effective paraphrasing.

(p9.3) After several short text practices, the teacher can gradually increase the length and complexity of the reading texts to be paraphrased. This allows students to gradually build their skills and confidence in paraphrasing longer and more complex texts. Additionally, this activity helps students to expand their vocabulary and improve their writing style, as they must use appropriate synonyms and sentence structures to rephrase the original text (Escudero, et al., 2019;Hagaman & Reid, 2008).

(p9.4) Paraphrasing short texts is an effective strategy for improving both reading and writing skills in the ESL/EFL classroom. This activity provides students with the opportunity to practice their reading comprehension and writing skills in a structured and supportive environment. By gradually increasing the complexity of the texts to be paraphrased, students can build their skills and confidence in this important technique, and become more proficient readers and writers (Hagaman & Reid, 2008;Hirvela & Du, 2013;Chen, et al., 2015;Escudero, et al., 2019;Ruslan, et al., 2020).
