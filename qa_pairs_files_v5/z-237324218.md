(p0.0) Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the eighth most common cancer worldwide, with more than 835,000 new cases and 431,000 deaths due to the disease per year [1]. HNC comprises tumors in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx, and nearly 95% of them are squamous cell carcinoma histological type tumors [2]. The classical risk factors for developing HNC are smoking habits and alcohol consumption [3]. The human papillomavirus (HPV), in particular HPV16, is detected in approximately 25% of HNC cases, especially in tumors located at the oropharynx, and serves as a favorable prognostic factor for these patients [4]. Most HNC patients are diagnosed with measurable locally advanced disease, and only about half of these patients achieve complete or partial responses after treatment [5]. Besides surgery, cisplatin (CDDP), combined or not with radiotherapy (RT), has been used in HNC patients' treatment [6], but therapy resistance has been reported [7].

(p1.0) The transcription of pseudogenes depends on their genomic location, and it could be processed mainly into antisense RNAs, endogenous small interfering (endo-si)RNAs, or micro (mi)RNA sponges [18], acting as negative or positive gene regulators [19]. Pseudogene antisense RNAs can bind directly into sense RNA from the parental gene and inhibit its translation and protein production [20]. Pseudogene-derived endo-siRNAs are produced by cleaved pseudogene sense or antisense transcripts of double-stranded RNA or by the inverted repeat region of pseudogenes transcribed into hairpin-shaped RNA and sliced by the ribonuclease Dicer [20]. They are then separated into single strands and incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex to bind and degrade target mRNAs, inhibiting protein production [20]. Pseudogene transcripts can also act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) [21]. They may share miRNA response elements with other genes, especially parental ones, and positively regulate their expression by competing for the same pool of miRNAs, acting as miRNAs sponges [20]. In this process, pseudogene transcripts inhibit miRNA-target gene binding, allowing gene expression and modulating biological processes and tumor progression [22,23]. In addition, pseudogene transcripts in sense orientation may compete for miRNAs, RNA-binding proteins, and translational machinery with the parental gene [18].
