## (s5) Outdated and overlapping publications
Number of References: 10

(p5.0) SRoMAs are continually updated by incorporating relevant evidence from new studies to maintain validity and applicability. Otherwise, there would be a risk of inaccurate evidence or even a situation where erroneous evidence misleads decision-makers or researchers [39][40][41][42]. Moreover, different investigators or research institutions perform SRoMAs of the same exposure and population. Therefore, there can be two or more overlapping SRoMAs on the same research topics [43,44]. Some studies have reported that up to 2/3 of published SRoMAs overlap at least partially or completely [45]. Inclusion of data from overlapping SRoMAs would lead to a risk of bias, resulting in inaccurate results and estimates [46,47]. In addition, considering that up to 50% of published systematic reviews become outdated after 5.5 years [42], we used 2015 as the cutoff year. We referred to overlapping SRoMAs published before 2015 as outdated overlapping SRoMAs and overlapping SRoMAs published after 2015 as contemporary overlapping SRoMAs. If a contemporary SRoMA overlapped with an outdated SRoMA, the outdated SRoMA was excluded.

(p6.0) As in previous umbrella reviews [23,24,27,29,30], we classified evidence associating diet and RCC incidence into 5 categories. Evidence was judged to be convincing (class I) if the following criteria were met: statistically significant results were observed for both the association and the largest study (p<10 -6 and p<0.05, respectively), the number of cases exceeded 1000 or the number of participants for consecutive outcomes exceeded 20,000, there was low heterogeneity (I 2 <50%), the 95% prediction interval (PI) did not include a null value, there was no excess significance bias, and there were no small study effects ("p<0.10 of Egger's regression" plus "the random-effects summary estimate being larger than the point estimate of the largest study in the meta-analysis" can be considered as small study effects). Evidence was judged to be highly suggestive (class II) if the following criteria were met: statistically significant results were observed for both the association and the largest study (p<10 -6 and p<0.05, respectively); and the number of cases exceeded 1000 or the number of participants for consecutive outcomes exceeded 20,000. Evidence was judged to be suggestive (class III) if the following criteria were met: associations with statistical significance were observed for the association (p<10 -3 ); the number of cases exceeded 1000 or the number of participants for consecutive outcomes exceeded 20,000. Evidence was judged to be weak (class IV) if it met the criterion of a statistically significant association (p<0.05). The evidence was judged to be nonsignificant (class V) if no statistically significant association was observed (p≥0.05)
## (s8) Assessment of heterogeneity

(p8.0) We used I 2 to assess the heterogeneity of each published SRoMA. I 2 values range from 0 to 100% and are used as a measure of the magnitude of heterogeneity among individual studies and can be used to present the percentage of the total variance caused by heterogeneity [54]. I 2 <50% can be considered nonsignificant heterogeneity. τ 2 was also calculated, which can explain the betweenstudy variance associated with risk estimates because I 2 is affected by study size [55]. In addition, we calculated a 95% PI for the SHR, which further explains the heterogeneity among studies. This interval with 95% certainty provides a prediction range for the potential true effect size of future studies [55]. The I 2 , τ 2 , and 95% PI for each published SRoMA were calculated with the meta package in R [53].
## (s9) Assessment of publication bias and small study effects
Number of References: 10

(p9.0) For published SRoMAs, contour-enhanced funnel plots were used to assess whether indications of publication bias existed [56]. The presence of missing studies in areas of the plot without significant differences suggests that the funnel plot asymmetry may be due to publication bias; the presence of missing studies in areas with significant differences suggests that the asymmetry may be due to other causes, such as heterogeneity [57], rather than publication bias [56].

(p9.1) Egger's regression asymmetry test was employed to see if indications of small study effects existed (i.e., small studies provide greater effect size estimates than large studies) [57]. As in prior umbrella reviews [23][24][25], a p value<0.10 with a more conservative effect in the largest study (the study with the smallest standard error) than in the random-effects meta-analysis was deemed to be indicative of small study effects. To estimate true effects, the "trim-and-fill" approach was applied when Egger's test was statistically significant [58]. The contourenhanced funnel plots, Egger's test, and the trim-and-fill method were conducted with the meta and metafor packages in R [53,59].
