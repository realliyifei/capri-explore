Number of References: 12

(p1.0) The overall difficulty of early detection, early diagnosis, and the subsequent optimum treatment for patients with OC is exacerbated by the social disparities that exist in underserved communities. These disparities, in turn, lead to differences in survival rates and treatment. The existing literature supports the hypothesis that the risk of all-cause mortality in African American OC patients is roughly 1.3 times higher when compared to Caucasian women with OC, even when the access to care is equal [15] . The mortality rates have increased specifically for African American populations over time [15,16] . A study conducted by Srivastava et al. [16] demonstrated that from 1992 to 2008 the 5-year survival rates for Caucasian women rose from 40.7% to 45%, yet 5-year survival rates for African American women declined over that same time period from 47.9% to 40.3%. A similar study found that the 5-year survival rate for African American women had fallen to 36% from 2006 to 2012, while all races combined had a 45% 5-year survival rate, with Caucasian women having the highest 5-year survival rate at 46% [16] . This variation in survival rates appears to be due to a decreased likelihood of receiving guideline-recommended care [17] . Other studies have suggested that after controlling for factors like socioeconomic status (SES), patients with the same stage of OC have similar survival rates [3,18] . Studies suggest that patients of a lower SES are receiving care less in line with NCCN guidelines and have decreased access to preventative medicine and genetic testing, which could contribute to delayed presentation. However, most studies are limited by their inability to detect if a patient's SES and a delay of presentation to the clinic are correlated, which could, in turn, affect 5-year survival rates [3,18] . The current literature on the different survival rates of OC between diverse populations and the frightening statistics facing our underserved communities introduces a series of compelling questions. Why are patients with low SES presenting to the clinics with a more advanced disease? What preventative factors (i.e., the difference in the fund of knowledge, access, communication and financial resources) impact these differences in survival? Are there certain factors that are creating more disadvantages for patients who are underserved than other factors? What can be done to effectively mitigate these disparities? Studies have tried to control for such factors, with little success in large part because a multitude of critical contributing confounding variables is at work, not just one sole factor that is key in precluding underserved communities from attaining equal outcomes [18,19] . Currently there is a need for increased randomized control studies and interventional studies that could shed more light on the impact of these social determinants of health, however the challenge is to isolate certain variables in these studies and have a sample size large enough to draw impactful conclusions.
## (s2) GENOMIC DISPARITIES AMONG OC PATIENTS

(p2.0) The lifetime risk of developing OC is low, at 1.5%, and the vast majority of patients who develop OC comprise sporadic cases with no significant family history of the disease [1] . In contrast, the remaining group of patients with deleterious genomic germline mutations (i.e., BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes) carry a much greater lifetime risk for breast cancer and OC (i.e., 50%−85% and 20%−40%, respectively) [1,[20][21][22][23] . Patients with a known genetic susceptibility to OC are typically followed closely with a combination of pelvic examination, ultrasound imaging, and CA-125 testing in order to detect abnormalities at early curable stages. These patients are also typically offered risk-reducing surgery, which consists of removal or the fallopian tubes and ovaries at the completion of childbearing in order to prevent the onset of disease. Patients in underserved communities may have lack of access to this type of preventive medical care. Among these OC patients with deleterious germline mutations, a significantly decreased overall survival and the worse prognosis is reported in OC patients from underserved populations [24][25][26] . Bandera et al. [27] reported an increased OC risk, associated with a worse survival rate, in underserved communities after controlling for confounding variable. Factors, such as medical comorbidity risk, and prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation, pointing instead to other contributing etiologic factors, such as quality of care and delay in care, to explain the significantly poorer outcome. Although a higher incidence of unmanaged medical comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes) may be associated with an increased OC risk, these medical comorbidities alone cannot explain the poor outcomes in underserved populations [16,[27][28][29] .

(p4.0) High adiposity and inflammatory diets consisting of high sugar intake are associated with an increased risk of developing OC [16,[27][28][29][30] . A systematic review of 28 studies reported a statistically significant, association between obesity [body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2 or more] and OC [31] . Another large prospective study found that the risk of death from OC was higher in women with the greatest BMI (35-40 kg/m 2 ) compared with those of normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ) [32] . African American and Hispanic women have a disproportionately higher rate of obesity and have higher BMI (> 40) which may correlate with a higher incidence mortality of OC [16,27,28,33] . A correlation also exists between obesity and socioeconomic position, suggesting that more overweight and obese people are from underserved populations with poorer access to healthcare [34] . In addition to limited access to quality healthcare, obese patients may be more difficult to diagnose with OC due to greater difficulty in assessing vague symptoms and limited utility of current diagnostic approaches in these patients. Studies indicate that women who were considered overweight and obese had symptoms such as abdominal swelling and discomfort months before the diagnosis of OC [35] . Healthcare providers can impact meaningful change through education to patients of the positive impact of a low inflammation diet. Similarly, patient education regarding weight loss through healthy diet and exercise can meaningfully impact patient's health and reduce risk factors for OC.
## (s5) DIFFERENT OC PATIENTS RECEIVE DIFFERENT TREATMENT

(p5.0) Patients from different socioeconomic backgrounds and cultures experience a difference in quality treatment. African American women from underserved communities overall have lower 5-year survival rates from OC than their Caucasian counterparts, attributed to treatment delays [16] . Bristow et al. [44] reported that despite equitable access to healthcare, patients who hailed from lower SES status were less likely to receive treatment adhering to the NCCN guidelines [29] . Furthermore, a clear difference exists between populations regarding access to quality of healthcare, impacting the outcome of an OC patient. To understand the source of healthcare disparities is the key in order to pursue strategies to correct these disparities and eventually create initiatives to eliminate them.

(p5.1) An increasing body of literature suggests that patients from a lower SES receive substandard care, in large part from a general lack of proper facilities and equipment to carry out standard procedures [1,16,29,44] . Unfortunately, patients from underserved communities, have poorer access than affluent communities to high-quality healthcare [19,29] . African American and Hispanic patients were less likely to receive accurate staging for OC than Caucasian patients [29] . African American patients with OC also tend to receive less proactive treatment plans than Caucasian patients [16,19] . A study conducted at a large, high volume medical center showed that African American OC patients were less likely to undergo surgery than Caucasian OC patients overall, 61% and 77% respectively, and less likely to undergo chemotherapy [16,19,29] . Furthermore, underserved patients are much less likely to enroll in clinical trials and experimental treatments. In a study that analyzed over 400 clinical trials from The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) from 1985 to 2013, 83% of participants were Caucasian, and only 8% African American, and 2.2% Hispanic [29,42,45] . As compared with the expected Centers for Disease Control projections for minority participation in clinical trials, actual African American participation was 15 times lower than expected for ovarian GOG trials [45] . The GOG also reported that the rate of participation for African American patients has been decreasing over time, demonstrating that participation from African American communities has decreased 2.8 times from 1994-2002 to 2009-2013 [45] . There are many possible explanations for poor participation by minority groups in clinical trials include lack of access to centers, which offer these trials, lack of understanding regarding the purpose and potential benefits of these trials, and lack of means such as transportation to effectively participate in these trials. Due to decreased levels of education, patients may have diminished understanding of how the treatment works and therefore cannot understand how these treatments are different from previous ones and might have decreased efficacy. Additionally, cultural and spiritual differences in these communities could also contribute to the disparity. Members of these communities have been spurned by healthcare institutions and other institutions in the past, which could result in an overall distrust in providers or healthcare institutions. All of these aspects stack the odds against minority communities from receiving proper treatment.

(p5.2) Armstrong et al. [46] reported that only 37% of patients received genetic counseling prior to testing for the BRCA1/2 gene, and of those that did receive counseling, most were Caucasian women (69%) who were married (76%), with high income (55%) and with a college degree (81.4%) [1,46] . African American women have a much lower rate of testing particularly in limited-resource settings, which is important because they have a similar or higher incidence of BRCA mutation than their Caucasian counterparts [1,[20][21][22][23] . It is estimated that roughly 12.4% of African American patients with breast cancer under 50 carry the mutation [1] . Limited resource settings are less likely to have a genetic counselor, and therefore patients are less likely to receive counseling support. All patients with OC should receive genetic counseling according to the NCCN guidelines. By undergoing genetic testing and genetic counseling, care providers can have a better understanding of the type of tumor that a patient is presenting with [21,38] . If the patient has a known BRCA1 or 2 mutation, then a provider has increased indications of what targeted therapies may work [1,[20][21][22][23]26] . A BRCA1 or 2 mutation may result in errors with homologous recombination mechanisms in the DNA repair system, consequently there are downstream genes that are more likely to be mutated as well. These downstream genes have been studied extensively and as a result, target-therapies have been developed targeting these mutations. Additionally, patients who receive genetic counseling and genetic testing have increased understanding of their cancer, which can help make more informed decisions when it comes to their care [21,38] . They have increased understanding about the progression of disease, their risks of developing cancer and their risks of passing this mutation onto their offspring. By providing this information, the decision-making model is shifting from one of paternalism to a shared-decision model, and allows for patients to be much more cognizant of early signs of developing cancer to begin treatment earlier, engage in more preventative treatment measures, and make care decisions in a timely manner that are in line with their values [1,38] . However, in this case patients with decreased SES and therefore decreased access to genetic testing and counseling providing care teams have less information on base treatment, which essentially limits patient involvement in their own care [1,19] . Proper genetic counseling prior to testing is a critical component of delivering this test and understanding the results.
