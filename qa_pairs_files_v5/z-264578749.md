(p13.0) Seven studies evaluated two DIY food-based fortification strategies with either different energy/protein loads (36,49,59), different fortificants (46,61,65) or different portion sizes (43).Four studies compared DIY food-based fortification with another alternative such as ONS ( 76), (74), adding high-energy and/or high-protein food items to the menu (55), or increased staff assistance to older people during mealtime (50) (Table 5).However, very few studies have produced statistics to compare the different options.Not surprisingly, higher energy/protein loads are associated with higher energy/protein intake (36,49).However, there was no significant difference between the 1.2 and the 1.5 g of protein / kg of body weight / day in the evolution of nutritional status and muscle mass over the 12-week intervention (49).In Ziylan et al. (43), the reduced-size enriched chicken meal led to a significantly higher energy intake than the normal-size meal.However, the difference in intake was rather small and no impact of portion size was observed for the enriched beef meals.In Evans et al. (46), a combination of three amino acids significantly improved muscle mass over 2 months while no change was observed when a single amino acid was used to fortify the orange juice.Stow et al. (76) observed no difference between food-based fortification and ONS while Sossen et al. (74) observed a slight advantage for DIY food-based fortification compared to ONS.Energy and protein intakes were higher with DIY fortification than with ONS, and body weight was stable with DIY fortification whereas it decreased with ONS during the 6 months of follow-up.Finally, providing DIY fortified food led to higher energy and protein intake when compared with improving staff assistance to older people during mealtime (50).A survey of the literature allowed the identification of five systematic literature reviews close to the topic of the present review (21-24, 30).Firstly, the systematic review of Trabal and Farran-Codina (23) investigated whether, compared to a standard diet, DIY food-based fortification with regular ingredients and/or powdered modules could improve energy and protein intake in older adults in hospital settings, long-care facilities or home settings.This review included 9 articles.The authors concluded that DIY fortification is a valid intervention for improving energy intake in older adults yet there was insufficient evidence for protein intake, nutritional status and body weight.Secondly, Morilla-Herrera et al. ( 21) targeted all studies related to DIY food-based fortification with macronutrients to prevent the risk of malnutrition in older patients receiving hospital services for acute or chronic disease, in older people living in nursing homes and in older people with home-care.This review encompassed 7 articles, and the meta-analysis highlighted that DIY food-based   The present review retrieved 44 articles that tested DIY foodbased fortification in people over the age of 65.This review differs from previous reviews in the following respects.Firstly, we focused the review on DIY food-based fortification, i.e., the addition of regular food ingredients or macronutrient extracts into conventional food matrices to increase energy and protein content in the final dishes. .Thirdly, we considered not only nutritional outcomes but also acceptability outcomes.In addition, we used a wide range of keywords to account for the lack of consensual terminology regarding the concept of DIY food-based fortification (Supplementary material).This allowed us to identify a much larger number of articles than in previous reviews.
