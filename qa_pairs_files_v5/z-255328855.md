## (s1) Dysbiosis and Immunity
Number of References: 9

(p1.0) The human gut microbiota formation begins immediately after birth and is shaped during the first few years of life [3,9]. Some research suggests that it starts even earlier, and the transition of maternal bacteria to the fetus may take place during pregnancy [10]. It is presumed that gut microbiota stabilizes and becomes similar to that of adults at the age of 3 years [11,12]; however, recent findings indicate that its development in some children may take longer [9].

(p1.1) Three phases of gut microbiota development have been proposed: the developmental phase with a gradual shift in phyla detected and alpha-diversity, during which Bifidobacterium spp. dominates, the transitional phase in which alpha-diversity continues to change Figure 1. Gut microbiota impact on host immunity and immunological changes observed in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome [15,17,18].
## (s5) Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome
Number of References: 15

(p5.0) Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a common childhood disease with an estimated incidence of 1.15 to 16.9 per 100,000 children, depending on the geographical region [19]. In children, the most common histological type of INS is minimal change disease accounting for 70-90% of cases [20]. Its pathogenesis remains elusive; however, it is attributed mainly to dysfunction or dysregulation of T cells, the presence of a circulating glomerular permeability factor, and according to recent studies, possibly also the dysfunction of B cells [18,21]. Growing evidence indicates a link between the gut microbiome and immune-mediated diseases, including the impact of dysbiosis on INS onset or recurrence. The suggested mechanism is connected with the observation that changes in the gut microbiome composition resulting in decreased SCFAs production may cause Treg abnormalities [22]. Butyric acid, by strong inhibition of histone deacetylase, enhances histone acetylation in the promoter and enhancer regions of the Foxp3 [23], a transcription factor specially expressed in Treg cells, that controls the expression of crucial immune-regulatory genes [24]. This hypothesis is supported by Tsuji et al. who observed a reduced proportion of butyric acid bacteria and lower fecal butyric acid quantities in pediatric patients with relapsing INS concomitantly with decreased circulatory Treg cells. They reported a lower amount of butyric acid-producing bacteria, such as Clostridium clusters IV, XIVa, Eubacterium spp, and Butyrivibruio spp., in fecal samples in children with relapsing INS compared to healthy controls, but not in the non-relapsing group. The comparison of fecal butyric acid quantities in feces confirmed that it was significantly lower only in patients with relapsing INS. There were no differences in other fecal organic acid quantities between groups [25].

(p5.1) A possible association between Treg cells, gut microbiota, and INS during the disease's onset and frequent relapses in the follow-up was investigated in another study by Tsuji et al. [26]. A significant reduction in the proportion of butyrate-producing bacteria genera in fecal samples of children with frequent relapses compared to healthy controls was shown, but not between non-relapsing patients and healthy controls. In addition, the rate of increase in Tregs response to glucocorticosteroid therapy was higher in the non-relapsing group than in the frequently relapsing group [26].

(p5.2) According to Yamaguchi et al., there was no difference in the diversity of the gut microbiota in the Shannon index or the number of species between healthy controls and children with INS before treatment [27]. However, the percentage of butyrate-producing bacteria species in children with INS at the onset of the diseases was significantly lower than in healthy controls (2.2% vs. 6.7%) [27]. The Shannon index is a quantitative indicator of the number of different bacteria present in a fecal sample, taking into account the uniformity in the distribution of these bacteria in these species [28].

(p5.3) Kang et al. assessed the alterations of gut microbiota in a group of 20 children with nephrotic syndrome before and after 4-week initial therapy with glucocorticosteroids and did not show changes in richness or diversity of intestinal microbiota [29]. However, the analysis of fecal samples after initial therapy showed an increase in the relative abundance of Deinococcus-Thermus and Acidobacteria at the phylum level. The compositional changes at the genus level also were observed, with an increase in the amount of Romboustia, Stomatobaculum, Cloacibacillus, Howardella, Mobilitalea, Deinococcus, Paracoccus, Stenotrophomonas, Gp1, Kocuria, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Brevundimonas, and Lactobacillusbacteria, and decrease in the abundance of Finegoldia and Corynebacterium. The significant increase in the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Romboustia, Stomatobaculum, and Cloacibacillus after initial therapy, supports the hypothesis of gut microbiota impact on Treg induction and differentiation and its link with the onset or exacerbation of glomerulonephritis mediated by SCFAs. Moreover, specific structural changes of microbiota result in functional profile change, in particular by weakening the selenocompound metabolism, isoflavonoid biosynthesis, and phosphatidylinositol signaling system, the pathways that are important in antioxidant defense. The diminished selenocompuund metabolism might help maintain the appropriate level of selenoproteins, which are the key enzymes in redox homeostasis and therefore might contribute to the remission of proteinuria after initial therapy. In contrast, decreased isoflavonoid biosynthesis and phosphatidylinositol signaling may be associated with higher relapse occurrence in children with INS [29].
## (s6) Membranous Nephropathy
Number of References: 6

(p6.0) Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults [33]. In children, membranous nephropathy more frequently is secondary to systemic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or hepatitis B [34]. The etiology of primary membranous nephropathy is associated with the production of autoantibodies directed against podocyte antigens, primarily M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) or thrombospondin type-I domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) [34]. In some cases, when the disease is not presumed to be linked with systemic diseases or secondary causes, the target antigen may remain unknown.

(p6.1) It hypothesized that gut dysbiosis may be related to idiopathic membranous nephropathy due to autoantibody production induced by clonal expansion of B cells promoted by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [4], decreased SCFAs production [35], or increased generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway by lipopolysaccharide produced by Escherichia-Shigella and Bacteroides [4].
## (s10) Dietary Interventions
Number of References: 8

(p10.0) Diet is one of the key elements that modulate gut microbiota composition and function [44,45]. Some research suggests that specific diets may alleviate the imbalance in intestinal microbiota [46]. In search of therapeutic options for patients with nephrotic syndrome, especially those with steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, the possible impact of dietary modifications on a disease course has been studied [46]. Among elimination diets, gluten and dairy restrictions have been linked with a significant reduction of proteinuria in patients with steroid-sensitive, steroid-dependent, or steroidresistant nephrotic syndrome [46,47]. Although most of these observations were based upon clinical cases of patients with food sensitivities [46], the proposed mechanisms are alterations in the intestinal microbiota resulting in changes in the production of inflammatory mediators that may act as glomerular permeability factors, or direct effect of gluten-free diet on podocyte structure [48].
## (s11) Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
Number of References: 14

(p11.0) Another treatment option aiming to reshape the composition of gut microbiota is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) [49] Its effectiveness has been observed in the treatment of recurrent and refractory Clostridium difficile infection, both in pediatric and adult patients [49][50][51]. It is presumed a promising therapy not only in gastrointestinal tract diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome, but also in several autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, and neurological disorders [49][50][51][52]. Only a few clinical cases reported the usage of FMT in the treatment of adult patients with primary glomerulopahties [53,54]. Partial clinical remission was observed in two female patients with refractory IgAN after FMT [53]. FMT application in a male patient suffering from chronic diarrhea and membranous nephropathy alleviated gastrointestinal symptoms and improved renal function [54]. Additional studies are needed to assess the safety, effectiveness, and short-and long-term effects of FMT in non-gastrointestinal diseases, including glomerular diseases [50,51].
