(p0.0) Artificial insemination (AI) is a powerful and unique technique for fertilizing the females of most mammals. The first animal was conceived using AI in 1784, and the first trial to produce straw for AI was at the beginning of the 20 th century [1]. AI was intended to increase the number of insemination doses from a single ejaculate but was unsuccessful because of the absence of sperm-washing procedures for both chilled or frozen-thawed semen of the male donor. These techniques are considered the foundation stone in the history of AI [1]. Moreover, AI is widely applied in cattle [2] and humans [3] but less in sheep [4], buffalos [5], horses [6], deer [7], and other mammals [8].
## (s1) Preservation of Semen

(p1.0) The two primary techniques for semen storage are chilling and cryopreservation. For the chilling technique, semen is stored at 4-5°C for 3 days for maximum and best results. In the cryopreservation technique, semen is exposed to freezing for 3 h at 4°C. Meanwhile, it is filled into 0.25-mL straws and finally preserved and stored in liquid nitrogen for years [14]. Therefore, the crucial factors for long-term semen preservation to retain its quality include cooling for 2-3 h, adding a cryoprotectant, and freezing in liquid nitrogen [15].
## (s20) Source of Energy

(p20.0) Energy intake is responsible for the continuation of development and the function of all living cells, and gametes are no exception. Two metabolic pathways are producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), that supplies energy for the main functions of sperm, which are oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis [123]. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of sperm cells and provides energy for sperm metabolism [123]. Sugar, such as fructose and glucose, is considered the primary energy source in sperm cells [124]. However, fructose is the best sugar for maintaining functional membrane integrity, adequate sperm motility, andtonic after thawing [125].
## (s36) Sperm morphology

(p36.0) Sperm morphology depends on spermiogenesis [188] or events that occur after spermiation [175]. Improper handling of semen samples because of lack of experience can cause challenges during the cooling and freezing processes. Furthermore, these challenges may lead to acrosomal damage and abnormality of sperm tails [189]. Sperm shape abnormality includes head defects, such as microcephaly and macrocephaly. Midpiece defects, such as proximal cytoplasmic droplets, distal midpiece reflexes, and segmental aplasia of the mitochondrial sheath, are common [190].
## (s37) Acrosomal Reaction

(p37.0) The study of acrosomal integrity in mammalian species is a valuable tool in evaluating male subfertility and infertility. With advancements in microscopic visualization and cell-staining technology, methods for determining acrosomal integrity have been developed. The acrosome reaction is an exocytotic event initiated when sperm binds to the zona pellucida of an ovum. Once sperm binding occurs, the outer acrosomal membrane fuses with the overlying plasma membrane of the ovum [194]. The fusion of these membranes triggers vesiculation, a process where many small vesicles are created that allows for the dispersal of acrosomal enzymes [195,196]. The release of acrosomal enzymes enables the sperm cell to digest its way through the zona pellucida and begin the process of fertilization [197,198].
## (s40) In vivo Fertility Evaluation

(p40.0) It is crucial to examine the in vivo fertility test to provide comprehensive and perfect data. This test is considered the most important one for evaluating semen quality and provides information on the capability of sperm and pollination capacity of the ova after access to the female reproductive tract. Potential fertility depends on multiple parameters that require a multi-parametric analysis of sperm morphology, sperm motility, membrane status of sperm, sperm acrosome reaction, and genome integrity of sperm to provide a complete picture of a male's fertility potential. Moreover, the reliability of fertility prediction is reported to increase by combining several in vitro sperm quality parameters [180,181,203]. The difficulty of this assay is that it is a time-consuming and costly procedure as hundreds of successful inseminations are required.
