(p0.0) Placebo and nocebo effects are the effects of patients' positive and negative expectations, respectively, about their health status and they can occur during treatment with a placebo or an active agent, either in clinical practice or in clinical trials.][3][4][5] Over the past 30 years, there has been a surge of research on the placebo and nocebo effects in the fields of neuroscience, medicine, psychology and genetics.What has emerged is that there are many placebo and nocebo effects, not just one.They occur through specific mechanisms in many clinical conditions and in the domain of physical and cognitive performance. 6Furthermore, it has been shown that many biological mechanisms triggered by placebos and nocebos resemble those modulated by drugs, suggesting a possible interaction between psychological factors and drug action. 6n 2018, a consensus of experts emphasised the importance of distinguishing placebo effects from placebo responses. 7This need
