(p3.0) The business insight is obtained from the raw data which is heterogeneous in nature. The heterogeneity in the data may be as a result of difference in data sources, the content of data format, type of data or as a result of diversity in data extraction process. Depending on the content of study data source can be human generated, machine generated, internal data sources, web and social media, transaction data, biometric data etc. Further, the context data format may vary from being structured, unstructured, semi-structured, images, text, videos, audio etc [23], [24]. Considering the data type, there is heterogeneity as meta data, master data, historical and transactional data. In the business intelligence study the heterogeneity in data is also contributed by the data extraction method that may depend on the on-demand feeds, continuous feed, real time feeds or time series.
