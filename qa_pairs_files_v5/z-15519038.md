## (s1) Localization and functions of CS protein
Number of References: 10

(p1.0) What is known about the role of the CS protein in malaria parasite biology and pathogenesis has been reviewed previously [9,10]. Initially identified as a Plasmodium berghei ortholog antigen Pb44, the CS protein [11] was shown to be the target of protective antibodies to the sporozoite surface in murine models over 25 years ago [12][13][14]. CS covers the entire surface of sporozoites [15], the form of the malaria parasite inoculated into humans by female anopheline mosquitoes, and is found on the plasma membrane of liver-stage parasites, which develop after sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes. CS has been detected in the cytoplasm of infected hepatocytes and a recent report indicated that CS plays a role in suppression of liver-stage inflammatory responses in a P. berghei model [16]. CS is secreted at the apex of sporozoites, becomes an integral component of the plasma membrane and is continuously released in large amounts at the distal tip of the sporozoite during gliding motility [17,18].
## (s3) CS-specific CMI and vaccine efficacy

(p3.0) RTS,S-induced CS-specific CD4+ T cell frequency, as enumerated by both ex vivo ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining, is associated with protection against infection [31]. However the available data indicates that IgG plays a more important role in RTS,S-mediated protection than CMI. The potential contribution of CD8+ T cells in killing of intracellular hepatocyte infection is unquestioned. This evidence stems from adoptive transfers and pre-clinical models of whole organism and subunit vaccine immunity [56][57][58] with some indirect evidence from clinical studies [59,60]. CD8 T cells are thought to be the critical determinant of irradiated sporozoite immunity, at least in mouse models where immune mechanisms can be dissected in detail [58]. There is, therefore, good reason to believe that induction of robust liver-stage specific CD8+ T cell responses in addition to RTS,Sinduced IgG and CD4+ T cells, could add to currently achieved levels of clinical protection. There is also evidence for the important role of CD4+ Th1 responses from both pre-clinical adoptive transfer experiments [61] and field trials [62]. Furthermore protective CD8+ responses may be CD4+ T cell dependent [58]. Thus further improving upon currently attained CD4+ T cell magnitude may augment RTS,S-induced protection [63]. It is worth noting that modest CD4+ T cell ex vivo Î³-interferon responses alone at an arithmetic mean of 129 spot forming cells/ million PBMCs induced by DNA/modified vaccinia virus Ankara prime-boost delivery of P. falciparum CS were not associated with efficacy in a sporozoite challenge trial in the UK [64].
