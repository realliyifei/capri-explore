(p0.0) Over the past few years, the inclination towards industrial robots has increased tremendously. Traditional industrial robotic systems require heavy fence guarding and peripheral safety equipment, reducing flexibility while increasing costs and necessary space. Due to this, the requirement for flexible solutions has escalated. Hence, the introduction of collaborative robots has played an important role. Collaborative robots (cobots) are a type of robots that engage with humans closely, sharing the same workspace [1], [2]. The current market demands reduced lead time and operating costs. Cobots represent a natural evolution that can solve existing challenges in manufacturing and assembly tasks, as they allow for physical interaction with humans in a shared workspace; moreover, they are designed to be easily reprogrammed even by non-experts to be repurposed for different roles in a continuously evolving workflow [3]. They can solve complex manufacturing challenges and are seen as a promising way to achieve an increase in productivity [4]. The importance of cobots to today's robotics society has been discussed by many researchers. For example, Lloyd argued that conventional robots tended to be evolved into cobots; the market share of cobots would be increased from 3 % in 2018 to 34 % in 2025. The total market value of cobots would increase from $9 to 12 billion at an annual growth rate of 57 % [5].
