(p0.0) Treelines, which indicate the boundary between trees and other types of vegetation, exist as vegetational transition zones in high mountain regions and at high latitudes. Treelines indicate a threshold of which above trees are no longer capable of growing and are dependent on local climate characteristics (Körner and Paulsen, 2004). Naturally occurring treelines primarily exist in cold areas and are often limited by low temperatures (Paulsen and Körner, 2014). The regions in which climate-restricted treelines are primarily located, such as high mountains and the Arctic, have experienced more rapid rates of warming compared to the global average (Nogué s-Bravo et al., 2007;IPCC, 2014). For example, the Arctic has experienced a 24% increase in days with temperatures above freezing (Bhatt et al., 2010), while temperatures in the Swiss mountain regions has increased at approximately twice the magnitude compared to the mean trend of the Northern Hemisphere (Rebetez and Reinhard, 2008). The increase in temperature has led to an expansion of suitable habitat for trees in many regions. As a result, many of the world's studied treelines have migrated to higher elevations and latitudes (Harsch et al., 2009).
