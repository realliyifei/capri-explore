(p1.0) The primary throat structures affected by trauma are (in descending anatomical order) the hyoid bone and thyroid and cricoid cartilage. Note however, that varying degrees of ossification of the thyroid and cricoid cartilage can occur. Although there is some debate about the embryologic development of the hyoid [4,5], most recognize considerable age variation in the union of its anatomical components. Throat structures demonstrate some anatomical variation that must be considered in evaluation [6]. A small triticeous cartilage structure also can occur [7].

(p4.0) As noted above, throat trauma can result in fracture of the hyoid bone, and thyroid and cricoid cartilage and/or bone [69,70]. Of these three structures, the hyoid and thyroid are most commonly affected. Sharma et al. [71] studied deaths due to constriction of the neck, finding hyoid fracture in 21% of cases and thyroid cartilage fracture in 17%. Fracture was also more likely in individuals of advanced age, also noted by Cl ement et al. [72].
