## (s8) Type of NET

(p8.0) NETs can be either NG when they terminate in the stomach or nasoduodenal (ND) or nasojejunal (NJ) when they terminate in the duodenum or the jejunum, respectively.Both NG and ND/NJ tubes are available in different lengths and sizes, but NG tubes are generally stiffer and have larger diameters.Both can be used for ETF and medication delivery, but only NG tubes can be used for gastric decompression and lavage (â–ºTable 1).Some clinicians prefer small-bore NET in patients with a history of EVs assuming they are associated with less risk of GIB when compared with large bore ones. 28However, there is no evidence to support this practice.In fact, there is some evidence that the risk of GIB is not different between NG and ND/NJ tubes when there is a history of EVs.Al Obaid et al's study found there was no significant difference in the incidence of GIB between NJ/ND tubes and NG tubes. 20A similar finding was noted by a smaller study by Charlton et al. 29 Lastly, Ritter et al found no episodes of GIB in 75 patients with known EVs and all had 16Fr NG tubes. 21herefore, the choice of the tube type should be based on the clinical indication, availability, need for gastric emptying, risk of aspiration, and patient comfort.
