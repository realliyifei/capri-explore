## (s12) Altered Neural Viability and Neurodegeneration
(p12.0) Neuronal network morphogenesis is based on an effective equilibrium between neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration, as well as the formation of new cells through proliferation/survival signalling and cytoskeletal structures [120]. ADHD seems to present a morphogenesis dysregulation [92,121], with a high number of neurophysiological difficulties caused by neuronal network dysfunctions in the brain. It has been observed that the inability to modulate neural connections can promote a reduction of brain volumes and inefficient neural networks [92]. These impairments might be the result of neurodegeneration, neurogenesis problems, altered proliferation-differentiation balance, deficient neurotrophic factors and, thereby, loss of neuronal viability [92]. Besides, oxidative stress results in a notable problem in terms of neuronal damage which can lead to all of the defects mentioned above [92].
## (s28) LDX
(p28.0) It is important to remark that the inflammatory profile of LDX has not been evaluated in an ADHD context. It has been assessed in ADHD comorbid disease, such as bipolar disorder in animal models [160], in which LDX increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-6, and also the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in the frontal cortex, striatum and serum [160,198]. However, a recent study did not show LDX having an effect on IL-10 (antiinflammatory cytokine, upregulated to control the inflammatory response duration and intensity) neither on TNFa nor on IL-1b (proinflammatory cytokines) [199]. On the other hand, MAOA inhibition and TAAR1 activation by LDX (both direct targets of LDX) might influence MAPK3 activation, which is crucial for the downstream modulation of a large number of proteins involved in many biological processes, such as neuroinflammation [200]. MAPK3 can induce the expression of some antiinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-2, IL-10), downregulated in patients with ADHD, via NFjB (NFKB1) activation [200][201][202].

(p28.1) Recent evidence suggests the involvement of the immune system in several psychiatric conditions [203][204][205]; one of the most studied in this respect is depression [206][207][208]. Given the role of LDX in modulating inflammatory and immunomodulatory molecules in psychiatric condition settings, a possible role of LDX in modulating the immune system in other psychiatric conditions, such as depression or ADHD, could be expected. Thus, more studies are required to understand the inflammatory profile of LDX in ADHD.
