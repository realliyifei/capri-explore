## (s1) Conventional Vaccines
(p1.0) As stated by the WHO, vaccines are pharmaceutical formulations that generate protective immunity against a disease by activating the production of specific antibodies by the immune system against a pathogen [12]. Vaccines are considered the most effective method to control epidemics, such as measles, diphtheria, and, eventually, SARS-CoV-2. The first vaccine used in the Western world was discovered by E. Jenner at the end of the eighteenth century against smallpox, a terrible cause of mortality at the time [13]. This vaccine was based on the cowpox virus. E. Jenner was a rural physician who realized that cattle workers who recovered from cowpox disease were protected against smallpox. However, he did not know that the disease was caused by a virus; an infectious agent that was not discovered and described until the twentieth century.
## (s6) Lipid Nanoparticles
(p6.0) Due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, two mRNA-based vaccines developed using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) received emergency use authorization from the US FDA for clinical use (Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech) ( Figure 3) [40][41][42]. This overcame initial skepticism about the use of biotechnological approaches based on nanoparticles. Especially when nanoparticles have unique advantages such as protection of cargo from degradation (very important for mRNA, as stated above), increased surface area and modulation of drug pharmacokinetics. In this regard, early data revealed that BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 have an efficacy of 95% and 94.5% against SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The Moderna vaccine is based on a stabilized mRNA of the viral spike protein, and BNT162b2 on a nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [40]. Although in the case of SARS-CoV-2, other vaccines were developed based on other approaches, mRNA-based vaccines received priority clinical approval, as the technology ensures the mRNA stability, along with greater mRNA transport and delivery efficiency into the host cell. As non-infectious vaccines, In this regard, early data revealed that BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 have an efficacy of 95% and 94.5% against SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The Moderna vaccine is based on a stabilized mRNA of the viral spike protein, and BNT162b2 on a nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [40]. Although in the case of SARS-CoV-2, other vaccines were developed based on other approaches, mRNA-based vaccines received priority clinical approval, as the technology ensures the mRNA stability, along with greater mRNA transport and delivery efficiency into the host cell. As non-infectious vaccines, they are safer and do not require penetration of the cell nucleus and can be produced rapidly. On the other hand, mRNA transport, conservation, and cellular internalization are complicated by the enzymes that can degrade it and the negative charge of the cell membrane. These two facts were neutralized by the design of LNP-based carrier molecules to preserve the integrity of the mRNA and favor its internalization within the cell [40]. LNPs are an FDAapproved carriers that are widely used to carry mRNA encoding antigens, encapsulating viral antigens against cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza and rabies, among others [43].

(p6.1) Liposomes were employed as drug delivery systems since the 1960s-70s and were sophisticated over time for disease-targeted delivery [39,40,44]. Liposomes are small spherical vesicles formed by one lipid bilayer (unilamellar liposomes) or several lipid bilayers (multilamellar liposomes). Lipid nanoparticles, unlike classical liposomes, form micellar structures within the nucleus. The structure of LNPs consists of a central solid lipid core, which is composed of triglycerides or glycerides. As can be observed in Figure 3, LNPs consist of four parts (a) an ionizable lipid portion that allows self-assembly, increases the speed of mRNA encapsulation, and aids endosomal escape, (b) cholesterol or a sphingolipid as a stabilizing agent for membrane stability and fusion, (c) a phospholipid that stabilizes the bilayer, encapsulating the lipid structure, and (d) a lipid-based stabilizing agent (polyethylene glycol-conjugated lipids), which increases the half-life, increases circulation time, and reduces non-specific binding to proteins [39,40,44]. Possessing rigid morphology, kinetic stability, low cytotoxicity, and immunogenicity make LNPs effective transporters of a diverse group of drugs, including nucleic acids, since ionizable lipids have a near-neutral charge at physiological pH, but in acidic endosomes, they ionize, favoring the endosomal escape and, therefore, mRNA release inside cells [45].
## (s8) Extracellular Vesicles
(p8.0) Another approach currently being studied is the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as vehicles [46]. Evs are a heterogeneous group of extracellular bilayers produced by almost all cell types, including exosomes (50-150 nm), which are processed by the endosome as well as LNPs. These Evs also have good biocompatibility and immunogenicity and are being used in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics of different diseases. In this regard, the cellular source from which these EVs are derived is crucial, as it was shown that EVs can reproduce the properties of the cells from which they originate and could also work for their specific delivery, in combination to their transport function. The limitations associated with this approach focus on the characterization, isolation, and purification of homogeneous EVs as well as the loading and release of the drugs that they carry [46].
