## (s1) Elasticity of Soft Tissues
(p1.0) The description of the mechanical behavior of tissues requires certain physical parameters that can be used to assess the response of tissues to applied loads. As with other materials, the parameters that quantify the mechanical properties of the tissue are based on the relationship between the forces acting and the result of these forces expressed in terms of shape changes, resistance to deformation, and the energy involved in this process. Extensibility, modulus of elasticity, elastic-strain energy, and ultimate strength can be derived from the relationship between the force applied to the material being stretched and the resulting extension, which is expressed in the form of stress-strain curve. The resistance of the material against deformation when subjected to a given stress, that is, its stiffness is expressed as Young's modulus (modulus of elasticity) and is calculated as the slope of the stress-strain curve within the linear region where the material deforms fully reversibly. The higher Young's modulus, the stiffer material and the greater its ability to transmit forces and resist deformation [1,5,38]. Thus, a more deformable compliant tissue will exhibit a lower elastic modulus than a less deformable "stiffer" one. As concerns the energy absorbed by the material during deformation, elasticity implies that it will be recovered during recoil [1,5,39]. The efficiency of energy recovery in a deformation: the recoil cycle is expressed as resilience, which should be 100% in a fully elastic deformation.

One of the richest sources of elastin is the nuchal ligament, where elastin forms a filamentous network that orients itself parallel to the direction of stretching, along the spinal cord, providing head support to large mammals [5]. In the elastic arteries, particularly in the aortic wall where elastin is the major component, elastin fibers surrounded by circumferentially oriented smooth muscle cells and collagen fibers form highly organized and thick concentric lamellae. Such an arrangement lets the artery diameter follow changes in blood pressure and hemodynamic stresses during the cardiac cycle [20,64]. Moreover, physical connections and synergy between elastic fibers and muscle cells ensure the proper response of the cells to mechanical strain [65]. In the muscular arteries, where elastin fibers are also abundant, they do not form such regular lamellar units as in elastic ones [66]. Elastin in small resistance arteries forms a thin layer of longitudinally aligned fibers in media, while in the adventitia, the fibers are more abundant and create a more complex network [2]. Longitudinally aligned adventitial elastin fibers were found in arterioles subjected to longitudinal stretch [67].
