## (s1) Methods/design
(p1.0) The study protocol is summarized in the PRISMA-Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist [30] (Additional file 1). Scoping literature reviews are intended to be comprehensive and systematically identify the breadth and depth of a body of literature [31], rather than focus on a narrow and specific research question that is typical of a systematic review for meta-analysis [32]. To ensure methodological rigor, we draw upon the scoping review framework and five-stage approach specified by Arksey and O'Malley [33] and additional steps specified by Levac [34], recommendations for consistency in approach [35]. The additional recommendations include clarifying and linking the purpose and research question in stage 1, balancing feasibility with breadth and comprehensiveness of the scoping process in stage 2, using an iterative team approach to selecting studies in stage 3 and extracting data in stage 4, incorporating a numerical summary and qualitative thematic analysis for reporting results, and considering the implications of study findings to policy, practice, or research in stage 5 [35]. A sixth stage of consultation, meeting with stakeholders for translating knowledge, is also recommended [34] but will not be incorporated in this phase of the work. We plan to conduct a mixed-review, which is defined as reviews that include quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method data sources and a parallel narrative synthesis approach with separate analysis of quantitative and qualitative data to interpret study results and map patterns in the data [36]. Qualitative studies will only be included if they are linked to a primary quantitative or mixed-method study of implementation of SMS and further elaborate on the implementation approach or strategies used. The five stages of this scoping literature review to be followed are described below:
## (s14) Stage 3: Study selection Search criteria
(p14.0) Scoping studies are iterative; thus, proposed search terms may need to be refined as the extent of literature in the field becomes evident [33]. The literature search strategy will be initially developed for MEDLINE in consultation with an information specialist who has expertise in cancer reviews (RH). The MEDLINE strategy can be found in Additional file 3: Figure S1. An initial test of the search terms will be conducted in MEDLINE to refine the terms, and the search strategy will be modified for all other databases. A second information specialist at the University Health Network (Toronto, ON) has conducted a peer review of the search strategy using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist, which is common practice for scoping reviews [56,57]. Specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free text terms for self-management, self-efficacy, self-management support and related terms, i.e., "self-care" or "educat" or "activate," will be combined with terms for "cancer". These terms will be combined with implementation study terms, for example "real world," "routine clinical care," primary care, "Phase IV," "knowledge translation," "adoption," "integration," "dissemination" and "implementation" using Boolean logic operators (and, or).
