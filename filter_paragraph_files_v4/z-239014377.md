## (s1) METHOD 2.1. The review protocol-ROSES
(p1.0) The ROSES review protocol lead the current research. The ROSES protocol is developed for systematic review and environment management field maps [34]- [45]. Additionally, the ROSES protocol also encourages researchers to guarantee that they offer the correct information with explicit details. The researchers began the SLR by formulating research questions according to the review's protocol [46]- [48]. Subsequently, the researchers were required to describe the systematic searching strategy that consists of three processes, such as identification, screening and eligibility. the researchers were also required to perform a quality appraisal of the selected articles. Lastly, the authors elaborated on the outcomes generated from the chosen principal articles.
