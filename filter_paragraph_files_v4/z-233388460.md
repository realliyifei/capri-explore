## (s9) Respiration-Based Indicators
(p9.0) Respiration-based indicators (i.e., RR, panting score (PS)) are considered to be relevant indicators for assessing heat strain in dairy cows just like RT. Indeed, panting, along with sweating, contributes to increased evaporative heat losses that are used to maintain homeothermy in cattle. More importantly, the respiratory system starts to help dissipate heat before CBTs measured rectally or vaginally begin to rise [8,61,114,115]. Respirationbased indicators may be the most appropriate indicators to early monitor heat strain in dairy cows due to high sensitivity to stressors and cost-effective measurement [115]. The latest measurement methods and thresholds of respiration-based indicators are listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
