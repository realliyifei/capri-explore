## (s15) F. POWER ASSIGNMENT
(p15.0) The PA scheme affects the error rate performance, and hence, it is a crucial aspect to discuss. Generally speaking, there are two main PA schemes, which are fixed PA and adaptive PA. The former ensures minimum signaling overhead and low complexity owing to its non-optimality, whereas the latter can ensure optimality or sub-optimality but with higher signaling overhead and complexity [34]. A number of issues should be considered when designing both schemes. First, ambiguity at the receivers. For example, ambiguity can be caused at the receivers for two NOMA users with binary phase shift keying (BPSK) if equal power coefficients are given when x 1 = −x 2 . Hence, two NOMA symbols will coincide on the same constellation point.
## (s37) 2) SYNCHRONOUS UL COMMUNICATIONS
(p37.0) To mitigate the error propagation problem caused by SIC, [147] propose an improved detector to allow much smaller range of power differences between the UL-NOMA users, as compared with SIC. The proposed detector is based on hard decision JMLD to find decisions on the weak user signal, then using them to cancel the interference from the strong user. Hence, computing the LLRs to find the strong user signal, which is then used to cancel the interference from the weak user signal. Assuming co-phased signals transmitted from the users, the uncoded BER of the SIC and the proposed detector are derived considering QPSK for both users.

## (s38) 3) DL COMMUNICATIONS
(p38.0) The authors of [148] propose a low-complexity threshold based detector to detect the signals of two NOMA users in the DL, where the BS is equipped with a single antenna while the users are equipped with multiple antennas and use M n -QAM with M n ∈ (4, 16). The exponential bound of the Q(·) function is used to derive the SER expressions for Rayleigh fading channels. Al-Dweik et al. [149] study phase-independent NOMA using unipolar amplitude shift keying (ASK) which allows amplitude-coherent detection. Considering two and multiuser systems in ordered SISO Rayleigh fading channels, closed-form BER expressions are derived for three types of detectors, namely JMLD, conventional SIC and improved SIC. The improved SIC cancels interference more effectively than conventional SIC and has identical performance to the JMLD but with lower complexity. Reference [150] introduces a modified SIC detector for an UL-NOMA system. The proposed modified detector incorporates adaptable decision regions and enhance the decoding performance. Exact closed-form SER expressions and approximations are derived for the three-user case over AWGN channels while considering a single antenna at all nodes and QPSK. Furthermore, the study identifies specific scenarios in which the proposed SIC detector demonstrates superior performance compared to the conventional SIC detector.

## (s46) 1) COOPERATIVE NOMA WITH DEDICATED RELAYING
(p46.0) Kara and Kaya [174], [175], consider a diamond-shaped CRS based on NOMA, with two HD-DF relays and a single destination. It is assumed that one relay is located at a far distance from the source, while the other relay is located closer. The transmission is accomplished in two time slots. During the first time slot, the source transmits a NOMA symbol of two BPSK modulated signals to both relays. The far relay employs single-user MLD, whereas the near relay uses SIC. In the second time slot, both relays use the UL-NOMA concept to forward the detected information to the destination. Finally, the signal received from the near relay is detected by the destination, while the signal received from the far relay is detected using SIC. For both time slots, the authors derive the BER over a SISO Rayleigh fading channel. Moreover, Kara and Kaya [176] consider a two-user DL-CRS with a single HD-DF relay located closer to the near-user, where no direct link exists between the users and BS. In the first time slot, the PA is applied in a reversed order, i.e., the power allocated to the near-user is larger than the power allocated to the far-user. However, the PA in the second time slot follows the conventional approach. It is worth noting that the SIC decoding order depends on the PA. Exact closedform BER expression is derived for identical QPSK with imperfect CSI over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p46.1) Kara et al. [177] propose using NOMA for a single-user CRS to overcome the SER degradation inherent to HD mode. In the proposed model, the source multiplexes two consecutive symbols as a NOMA symbol, where the first symbol x 1 is treated as the near-user, and thus it is allocated less power than the second symbol x 2 , the NOMA symbol is then transmitted to a HD-DF relay and to the destination. During the first time slot, the destination detects only x 2 while treating x 1 to be in the noise floor. The relay detects x 1 using SIC and forwards it to the destination in the second time slot. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived for BPSK over Nakagami-m fading channels. Further, the authors propose a machine learning PA algorithm to minimize the BER.
## (s50) 5) VLC-BASED COOPERATIVE RELAYING SYSTEM
(p50.0) The authors of [202] study a multiuser cooperative VLC-NOMA. The LED broadcasts the OOK modulated NOMA signal through non-fading channels to N users. The users perform SIC to detect the individual signals. Therefore, the nearest user has to detect the signals of all other users, while the farthest user detects only its own signal. The second round is composed of N−1 time slots during which each user forwards the detected signals of other users. The cooperation ensures the link reliability for the far-users. Furthermore, the far-users use MRC and SIC to detect their desired signals. The exact BER of the proposed model is derived under the assumptions of perfect CSI and imperfect SIC.
## (s53) 2) IM-OFDM/TDMA/CDMA/PD
(p53.0) State-of-the-Art NOMA-based IM-OFDM: Chen et al. [212] study a two-user cooperative NOMA-based IM-OFDM system. During the first time slot, the BS transmits the IM-OFDM information in a NOMA fashion to both users. The near-user performs SIC to detect its signal, while the faruser retains the received signal till the next slot. During the second time slot, the near-user acts as a relay and forwards the far-users signal. The far-user uses MRC-MLD to combine the signals received in the two time slots and detect its desired signal. Tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions are derived for both users over Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, Chen et al. [213] extend the work presented in [212] by proposing a low-complexity greedy detector, where they present tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions.

Hence, novel channel estimation methods should be considered for IRS, such as estimating the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels, or by considering semi-passive IRS models which have sensing capabilities [252].

## (s60) C. MMWAVE AND THZ COMMUNICATIONS
(p60.0) Higher frequency bands such as mmWave bands are currently used in the 5G standard to satisfy the growth in higher data requirements, since wider bandwidths are available at such frequencies. However, current trends indicate that THz bands, which are wider than millimeter bands, are considered a key technology for future wireless networks [25]. Nonetheless, the propagation limitations become more challenging and the communications would be directional and take place mostly in LoS environments. Therefore, the nearfar problem would exist even if the users are relatively in close proximity. Consequently, studying the best conditions for pairing the NOMA users under certain error rate performance requirements can provide a better understanding of the practical scenarios in which NOMA performance would be maximized. Furthermore, including technologies such as cooperative communications and IRS can be used to improve the network coverage.

## (s161) C. MMWAVE AND THZ COMMUNICATIONS
(p161.0) Higher frequency bands such as mmWave bands are currently used in the 5G standard to satisfy the growth in higher data requirements, since wider bandwidths are available at such frequencies. However, current trends indicate that THz bands, which are wider than millimeter bands, are considered a key technology for future wireless networks [25]. Nonetheless, the propagation limitations become more challenging and the communications would be directional and take place mostly in LoS environments. Therefore, the nearfar problem would exist even if the users are relatively in close proximity. Consequently, studying the best conditions for pairing the NOMA users under certain error rate performance requirements can provide a better understanding of the practical scenarios in which NOMA performance would be maximized. Furthermore, including technologies such as cooperative communications and IRS can be used to improve the network coverage.

## (s217) F. POWER ASSIGNMENT
(p217.0) The PA scheme affects the error rate performance, and hence, it is a crucial aspect to discuss. Generally speaking, there are two main PA schemes, which are fixed PA and adaptive PA. The former ensures minimum signaling overhead and low complexity owing to its non-optimality, whereas the latter can ensure optimality or sub-optimality but with higher signaling overhead and complexity [34]. A number of issues should be considered when designing both schemes. First, ambiguity at the receivers. For example, ambiguity can be caused at the receivers for two NOMA users with binary phase shift keying (BPSK) if equal power coefficients are given when x 1 = −x 2 . Hence, two NOMA symbols will coincide on the same constellation point.
## (s239) 2) SYNCHRONOUS UL COMMUNICATIONS
(p239.0) To mitigate the error propagation problem caused by SIC, [147] propose an improved detector to allow much smaller range of power differences between the UL-NOMA users, as compared with SIC. The proposed detector is based on hard decision JMLD to find decisions on the weak user signal, then using them to cancel the interference from the strong user. Hence, computing the LLRs to find the strong user signal, which is then used to cancel the interference from the weak user signal. Assuming co-phased signals transmitted from the users, the uncoded BER of the SIC and the proposed detector are derived considering QPSK for both users.

## (s240) 3) DL COMMUNICATIONS
(p240.0) The authors of [148] propose a low-complexity threshold based detector to detect the signals of two NOMA users in the DL, where the BS is equipped with a single antenna while the users are equipped with multiple antennas and use M n -QAM with M n ∈ (4, 16). The exponential bound of the Q(·) function is used to derive the SER expressions for Rayleigh fading channels. Al-Dweik et al. [149] study phase-independent NOMA using unipolar amplitude shift keying (ASK) which allows amplitude-coherent detection. Considering two and multiuser systems in ordered SISO Rayleigh fading channels, closed-form BER expressions are derived for three types of detectors, namely JMLD, conventional SIC and improved SIC. The improved SIC cancels interference more effectively than conventional SIC and has identical performance to the JMLD but with lower complexity. Reference [150] introduces a modified SIC detector for an UL-NOMA system. The proposed modified detector incorporates adaptable decision regions and enhance the decoding performance. Exact closed-form SER expressions and approximations are derived for the three-user case over AWGN channels while considering a single antenna at all nodes and QPSK. Furthermore, the study identifies specific scenarios in which the proposed SIC detector demonstrates superior performance compared to the conventional SIC detector.

## (s248) 1) COOPERATIVE NOMA WITH DEDICATED RELAYING
(p248.0) Kara and Kaya [174], [175], consider a diamond-shaped CRS based on NOMA, with two HD-DF relays and a single destination. It is assumed that one relay is located at a far distance from the source, while the other relay is located closer. The transmission is accomplished in two time slots. During the first time slot, the source transmits a NOMA symbol of two BPSK modulated signals to both relays. The far relay employs single-user MLD, whereas the near relay uses SIC. In the second time slot, both relays use the UL-NOMA concept to forward the detected information to the destination. Finally, the signal received from the near relay is detected by the destination, while the signal received from the far relay is detected using SIC. For both time slots, the authors derive the BER over a SISO Rayleigh fading channel. Moreover, Kara and Kaya [176] consider a two-user DL-CRS with a single HD-DF relay located closer to the near-user, where no direct link exists between the users and BS. In the first time slot, the PA is applied in a reversed order, i.e., the power allocated to the near-user is larger than the power allocated to the far-user. However, the PA in the second time slot follows the conventional approach. It is worth noting that the SIC decoding order depends on the PA. Exact closedform BER expression is derived for identical QPSK with imperfect CSI over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p248.1) Kara et al. [177] propose using NOMA for a single-user CRS to overcome the SER degradation inherent to HD mode. In the proposed model, the source multiplexes two consecutive symbols as a NOMA symbol, where the first symbol x 1 is treated as the near-user, and thus it is allocated less power than the second symbol x 2 , the NOMA symbol is then transmitted to a HD-DF relay and to the destination. During the first time slot, the destination detects only x 2 while treating x 1 to be in the noise floor. The relay detects x 1 using SIC and forwards it to the destination in the second time slot. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived for BPSK over Nakagami-m fading channels. Further, the authors propose a machine learning PA algorithm to minimize the BER.
## (s252) 5) VLC-BASED COOPERATIVE RELAYING SYSTEM
(p252.0) The authors of [202] study a multiuser cooperative VLC-NOMA. The LED broadcasts the OOK modulated NOMA signal through non-fading channels to N users. The users perform SIC to detect the individual signals. Therefore, the nearest user has to detect the signals of all other users, while the farthest user detects only its own signal. The second round is composed of N−1 time slots during which each user forwards the detected signals of other users. The cooperation ensures the link reliability for the far-users. Furthermore, the far-users use MRC and SIC to detect their desired signals. The exact BER of the proposed model is derived under the assumptions of perfect CSI and imperfect SIC.
## (s255) 2) IM-OFDM/TDMA/CDMA/PD
(p255.0) State-of-the-Art NOMA-based IM-OFDM: Chen et al. [212] study a two-user cooperative NOMA-based IM-OFDM system. During the first time slot, the BS transmits the IM-OFDM information in a NOMA fashion to both users. The near-user performs SIC to detect its signal, while the faruser retains the received signal till the next slot. During the second time slot, the near-user acts as a relay and forwards the far-users signal. The far-user uses MRC-MLD to combine the signals received in the two time slots and detect its desired signal. Tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions are derived for both users over Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, Chen et al. [213] extend the work presented in [212] by proposing a low-complexity greedy detector, where they present tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions.
## (s260) A. HYBRID IRS
(p260.0) As discussed in Section II, IRS can enhance the system performance by controlling the propagation of signals in the environment via passive smart metasurface elements. However, there are several challenges, such as acquiring channel estimates between all metasurface elements and users. Since the IRS is passive, it cannot transmit pilot/training signals to facilitate channel estimation. Hence, novel channel estimation methods should be considered for IRS, such as estimating the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels, or by considering semi-passive IRS models which have sensing capabilities [252]. Also, the phase cannot be controlled continuously in practice. Therefore, it is crucial to consider quantized phase control.

(p260.1) The error rate performance of IRS-assisted NOMA has been investigated for the DL direction only, where the assumptions of continuous and perfect phase are assumed [165], [166]. Hence, analyzing the error rate performance under imperfect and quantized phase is worth studying to get better practical insights. Moreover, the design and analysis for the UL direction is a promising direction as well. Furthermore, studying the system performance while considering the direct link between the users and the BS is still an open research question. Hence, the design and analysis of the dual function IRS in DL and UL-NOMA systems is attractive.
