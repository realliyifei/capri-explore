## (s10) Dietary Interventions
(p10.0) Diet is one of the key elements that modulate gut microbiota composition and function [44,45]. Some research suggests that specific diets may alleviate the imbalance in intestinal microbiota [46]. In search of therapeutic options for patients with nephrotic syndrome, especially those with steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, the possible impact of dietary modifications on a disease course has been studied [46]. Among elimination diets, gluten and dairy restrictions have been linked with a significant reduction of proteinuria in patients with steroid-sensitive, steroid-dependent, or steroidresistant nephrotic syndrome [46,47]. Although most of these observations were based upon clinical cases of patients with food sensitivities [46], the proposed mechanisms are alterations in the intestinal microbiota resulting in changes in the production of inflammatory mediators that may act as glomerular permeability factors, or direct effect of gluten-free diet on podocyte structure [48].
