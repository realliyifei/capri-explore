## (s12) Cost implications
(p12.0) Generally, individuals with cancer need to pay a greater percentage of their treatment costs through coinsurance and deductibles [93]. In most of the cancer patients out-of-pocket cost is a main barrier in starting and adhering to suggested advanced treatments [94]. PARP inhibitors are expensive compared with other available therapies. The out-of-pocket charges may differ depending on the insurance coverage of the patient and the local reimbursement policies. Although most insurance companies arrange for some coverage for PARP inhibitors, the patient's co-payment may remain unaffordable. The cost of coverage and the size of copayment may vary geographically. The cost-effective analyses study conducted by Gonzalez et al., reported that universal PARP inhibitor maintenance treatment is cost-effective compared with a biomarker-directed PARP inhibitor strategy [95]. The economic analyses conducted by Tan et al., demonstrated that olaparib has a high potential (87% probability) of being a cost-effective maintenance treatment in Singapore than routine surveillance among patients with advanced OC with BRCA mutations after response to first-line chemotherapy at a willingness-to-pay of Singapore dollar 60,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained [96].
