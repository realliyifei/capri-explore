## (s15) Barriers and facilitators to influenza and pertussis vaccination
(p15.0) Contextual influences. Black [65,75] and ethnic minority ethnicities [38] were amongst the most commonly cited barriers of vaccination, with only one review finding no effect of ethnicity [65]. Evidence for education as a predictor of vaccination was mixed, with one review citing low education as a barrier [64], supported by one primary study, and another finding no association [65]. Older age, employment, and being married were found to predict vaccination, whilst no effect was found for income or socioeconomic status in general [65]. Concerning wider influences, awareness of a national policy to support vaccination resulted in a threetimes higher probability of vaccination [40], with access and convenience another frequently cited facilitator [40]. One review each cited lack of convenience [38], and conspiracy theories [64] as barriers to vaccination.
