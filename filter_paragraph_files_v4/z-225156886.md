## (s8) Selection of PM
(p8.0) The selection of PM to place migrating VMs is done to complete the consolidation process to maintain the SLA and power consumption cost. In a cloud datacenter, VMs are required to place in appropriate PM for the best service delivery and minimum power cost. Migrating VMs from overloaded PMs were placed using various techniques, in this survey we found that the RL technique was applied for the selection of PM. The algorithm, based on Best RAM and bandwidth (BRB) was developed in which,PMs with enough resources for VM was assigned a mark (as a ratio of the required VMs random access memory (RAM) and available BW of PM) and the lowest mark PM was opted for placement of migrating VM [27]. In order to achieve the optimum cost of EC and SLA, the process of VM scheduling and placement optimization (Algorithm 1) is started from the prediction of resource utilization to detect overloaded (Algorithm 2) and underutilized PMs. All VMs are migrated from the underutilized PM and PM has to be made switched off or in sleep mode for maintaining the power consumption cost. VM is selected (Algorithm 3) from overloaded PM for the migration to maintain the load and finally, a PM is selected to place the migrated VM (Algorithm 4) [14].
