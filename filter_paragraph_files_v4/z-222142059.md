## (s1) Wearable Sensors
(p1.0) Wearable sensors are portable and movable accessories that can be worn on the body or embedded in clothes. ese devices include smart glasses, smart watches, smart clothes, or pressure shoes, among others. ey contain both special hardware and software technology, with unique functions of collecting spatiotemporal kinematic parameters, data processing, storage, and transmission. With the rapid development of the Internet technology and the advent of machine learning, wearable technology has been widely used in various fields. Currently, most of the wearable devices used in the field of PD are gyroscopes, accelerometers, or magnetometers [22,35,[43][44][45][46][47].
## (s7) Myotonia
(p7.0) Myotonia is an impairment of muscle relaxation, similar to bending soft lead tube, so called "lead tube" rigidity. Myotonia often presents gear-like rigidity that affects many joints of the body and presents special buckling posture. At the clinical level, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is often used to evaluate the neck, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, or other joints of patients [10]. To date, research has focused on quantification of muscle strength through biomechanics. Other methods have also been developed to quantitatively assess myotonia based on the parameters extracted from the passive motion of the joints [81].
