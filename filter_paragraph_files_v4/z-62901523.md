## (s1) II. BIOMETRIC SYSTEM
(p1.0) All the biometric systems have four basic modules which are sensor module, feature extractor module, matcher module and decision module [2]. These four modules are necessary in any biometric system to acquire and process raw biometric data and convert it into some useful information The block diagram of biometric system is shown in fig. 3.

## (s29) B. Biometric Cryptosystems
(p29.0) Biometric cryptosystems combines biometrics and cryptography to take advantages from the strengths of both the fields [9]. Cryptography provides higher degree of security and biometrics eliminates the need to remember any passwords or to carry any tokens. In traditional Cryptographic systems, one or more keys are used to convert a plain text into cipher text and key is known as encrypting key(s). Cipher text can be mapped back to plain text only with the help of decrypting key. If imposter obtains the cipher text he/she cannot extract useful information from it without the help of decrypting key. We use cryptographic systems to avoid dictionary attacks that can easily breaks the security of simple password based authentication systems. Biometric cryptosystems are subdivided into key generation and key binding.
