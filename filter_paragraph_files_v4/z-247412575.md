## (s1) INTRODUCTION
(p1.0) Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which affects several spheres of normal mental development with an onset in the first few years of life, usually prior to age 3 (1)(2)(3). Children with ASD are characterized by deficits in social interaction and social communication, together with the presence of repetitive, restricted patterns of behavior, interests, or activities present during early periods of development (4). Otherwise, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are a common comorbidity in patients with ASD. American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 1 in 54 children has been identified with ASD (or 18.5 per 1,000 8-year-olds), with a male-to-female ratio of 4-to-1 (5). It is challenging and costly work to care for children with ASD, with an estimated lifetime cost per affected child of $2.4 million in the US (6). Hence, the growing incidence of people classed on the ASD brings a great challenge to families, schools, medical systems, and society.
