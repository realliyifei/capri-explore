## (s7) | Key topic areas
(p7.0) Among the 272 included publications, 1067 unique keywords were identified. Of these, 69 were used at least five times. Co-occurrence of keywords (ie, keywords used together on a publication) is visually depicted in the network of co-occurring keywords (Figure 2). In this network, each circle represents a keyword and each line indicates co- Oncology's CancerLinQ initiative. 22 CancerLinQ is a large database that collects information from electronic health records of cancer patients to foster an oncology learning community across the United States; it has been described as a rapid LHS. 23 This example demonstrates the inherent need for integrated data platforms to support the adoption of LHSs and the importance of rapid implementation and implementation science in this sphere. 24 As to strengths and limitations, this study highlighted key topic reviews. There is a need to capture research written in languages other than English to obtain a more widespread view of the LHS concept and its potential. This is particularly important given the divide between high-, middle-, and low-income countries when it comes to big data and personalised medicine, 25 which are key components of LHSs.
