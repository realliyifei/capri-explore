## (s21) Detecting ALF in Clinical Practice
(p21.0) The prevalence of ALF is uncertain, but memory complaints in epilepsy are frequent [102]. The benefits of searching for ALF routinely in patients with reported forgetfulness is questionable-it remains unclear, how such a finding would change the patient's care strategy. It could nonetheless be important in substantiating the patient's concerns by providing objective evidence of an existing memory disorder. Such validation of subjective complaints may relieve the patient's distress by reassuring that ALF is not a functional disorder, but likely a consequence of epilepsy. However, ALF detection for both clinical and research purposes is not straightforward. The material employed to expose ALF varies in the type of information tested (verbal, story, picture, visuospatial design, route, real-life events etc.) while the paradigm employed during evaluation (recall, cued recall, and recognition) probably allows detection of distinct memory processes [10]. There are methodological recommendations to prevent bias during ALF testing and improve the patient experience [10,103]. These include testing for both verbal and visuospatial items, evaluating both recall and recognition, avoiding short-term memory influence (by prolonging the first testing interval) and ceiling, floor, and rehearsal effects. Further, new tests of both verbal and visuospatial memory are being explored for their potential use in ALF experiments [103]. Incidental memory tests may also be a practical solution as they would detect ALF for real-life events and be easy to effectuate in the clinical setting [45].
