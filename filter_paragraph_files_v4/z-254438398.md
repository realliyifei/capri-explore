## (s16) 2) NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION
(p16.0) A display installed on the robot, an interactive GUI, robot gaze, robot hand gesture, and robot body gesture are other ways of building RTH communication [9], [23]. The hand gesture is not limited to being used by the human user; robots could use this approach as a way of communication alongside other techniques such as gaze. The gaze of the robot could be an indicator of its readiness to execute a task [42] or to signal planned actions followed by an action [43]. The robot's gaze could help to accomplish two primary purposes, establishing mutual belief (that is, the user is indicated about the action to be taken) and indicating readiness for the next instruction. In this specific case, whenever a robot decides to close or open its hand or reach out to an object, it could look at its hand or look at the object in the task [23]. Robot gestures are an appropriate and informative communication medium in HRC, so more innovative methods, such as zoomorphic gestures, are introduced in the field [44].
