## (s5) Isatis indigotica
(p5.0) Isatis indigotica is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cruciferae family (28). Isatis indigotica is distributed across China, and Radix Isatidis, the dried roots of Isatis indigotica, are widely employed in the prevention and treatment of a wide range of viral infections, including fever, influenza, epidemic hepatitis, and bacterial infection for thousands of years (29). Based on recent clinical data, Radix Isatidis has clinical effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1-influenza (30,31). Numerous phytochemical studies have led to the isolation of valuable bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, glucosinolates, carotenoids, volatile constituents, and fatty acids, among which alkaloids are the dominant compounds (29). Owing to numerous studies, these ingredients have been identified to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects (32-34).
