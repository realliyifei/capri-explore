## (s9) Gene Transcription and mRNA Translation
(p9.0) Very few studies have investigated the functions of S1R at the NE. An original study on this subject showed that upon agonist exposure, i.e., (+)-pentazocine and cocaine, S1R was able to translocate from ER-LD to NE in NG108 cells [79]. S1R localization at the NE was further supported by an electron microscopy study showing S1R mainly located at the NE in mouse retinal neurons (including photoreceptor, bipolar, and ganglion cells) [88]. Later, it was established that upon cocaine stimulation, S1R translocation to NE enabled it to recruit chromatin-remodeling components, including Emerin, Lamin A/C, BAF (barrier-to-autointegration factor), and HDAC (histone deacetylase). Recruitment of these components was found to repress MAOB (monoamine oxidase B) gene expression through association with the transcription factor Sp3 (specific protein 3), in NG108 and Neuro2a cells ( Figure 6) [80]. Interestingly, S1R modulation of gene transcription and mRNA translation was also described in neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a spare nerve injury model of neuropathic pain [89]. In this study, the authors proposed that S1R translocation from ER to NE is supported by Sec61Î², a transport protein mainly residing at the ER ( Figure 6). Once at the nucleus, S1R was shown to interact with c-Fos and to bind 4E-BP1's promoter, thereby enhancing its expression and indirectly reducing Cav2.2 mRNA translation through inhibition of eIF4E [89]. Taken together, these studies demonstrated S1R localization at the NE and shed some light on the role of S1R within this organelle. Indeed, S1R scaffolding and chaperoning abilities not only promote and stabilize the NPC assembly, but also facilitate the nucleocytoplasmic transport, and recruitment of chromatin-remodeling components.
