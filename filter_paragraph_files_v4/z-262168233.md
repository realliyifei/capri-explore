## (s8) Fertility quantum First births and childlessness
(p8.0) There is a widely observed positive relationship between educational attainment and ultimate childlessness (Cygan-Rehm/Maeder 2013; Guzzo/Hayford 2020; Kalwij 2010; Requena/Salazar 2014; Wood et al. 2014).Postponement for higher educational attainment not only in uences fertility timing but is also associated with childlessness and is negatively linked to the realisation of fertility intentions (Berrington/Pattaro 2014; Morgan/Rackin 2010).Prolonged postponement is associated with increased chances of sterility and subfecundity (Te Velde et al. 2012).The decline in fertility rates during the last decades of the 20 th century in Europe was associated with persistent educational differences in childlessness (Wood et al. 2014).In some countries, such as Norway and Belgium, the educational gradient remained fairly constant across cohorts born 1940-1961, whereas, in others such as Spain, the Netherlands, and the UK, the educational gradient strengthened over time (Wood et al. 2014).Among the 1958 British cohort, one-quarter of women with a university degree remained childless compared to 12 percent of those without any quali cations (Berrington/Pattaro 2014).Over 20 percent of highly educated women forgo having children in Switzerland (Sobotka et al. 2011), whilst every additional year of education increases the odds of childlessness by at least two percentage points and decreases births by more than 0.1 children for women in Germany (Cygan-Rehm/Maeder 2013), usually explained by dif culties for highly educated women in combining motherhood with a career.The divergence in educational gradients is largely prevalent in countries characterised by the persistence of traditional gender roles, lack of affordable childcare services, or conservative welfare regimes that place higher motherhood penalties on highly educated women (Hanappi et al. 2017;Gangl/Zie e 2009).
