## (s4) Software Supply-Chain Attacks
(p4.0) The goal of supply-chain attacks is to inject malicious code into software or library externally. These attacks modify the targeted program so that it is still validly signed by its owner. The attacker simply injects his code into one of the software's dependencies [21]. Theoretically, an attacker can do this injection in any given node in the software's dependency tree. The ultimate goal is to alter the behavior of the root or a specific node, which is the targeted software product, using a child node, which in this case is a dependency node in the tree [21].
