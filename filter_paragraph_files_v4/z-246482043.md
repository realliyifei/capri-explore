## (s6) Credibility assessment
(p6.0) As in previous umbrella reviews [23,24,27,29,30], we classified evidence associating diet and RCC incidence into 5 categories. Evidence was judged to be convincing (class I) if the following criteria were met: statistically significant results were observed for both the association and the largest study (p<10 -6 and p<0.05, respectively), the number of cases exceeded 1000 or the number of participants for consecutive outcomes exceeded 20,000, there was low heterogeneity (I 2 <50%), the 95% prediction interval (PI) did not include a null value, there was no excess significance bias, and there were no small study effects ("p<0.10 of Egger's regression" plus "the random-effects summary estimate being larger than the point estimate of the largest study in the meta-analysis" can be considered as small study effects). Evidence was judged to be highly suggestive (class II) if the following criteria were met: statistically significant results were observed for both the association and the largest study (p<10 -6 and p<0.05, respectively); and the number of cases exceeded 1000 or the number of participants for consecutive outcomes exceeded 20,000. Evidence was judged to be suggestive (class III) if the following criteria were met: associations with statistical significance were observed for the association (p<10 -3 ); the number of cases exceeded 1000 or the number of participants for consecutive outcomes exceeded 20,000. Evidence was judged to be weak (class IV) if it met the criterion of a statistically significant association (p<0.05). The evidence was judged to be nonsignificant (class V) if no statistically significant association was observed (pâ‰¥0.05)
## (s25) Possible explanations and comparison with other studies
(p25.0) Increasing vegetable consumption was found to be inversely related to RCC risk in our study. A meta-analysis conducted by Zhang et al. found that the protective effect of vegetables was diminished after adjustment for body mass index [80], implying that obesity might be an important intermediate mechanism between vegetable consumption and the incidence of RCC. Obesity has been acknowledged by the guidelines of the European Association of Urology as a risk factor for RCC [146], which might be related to the inverse association between vegetables and obesity [147][148][149][150][151]. A randomized double-blind controlled trial in Japan showed that increasing the consumption of vegetables rich in carotenoids reduced visceral obesity in Japanese men [151]. Dreher et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial and prospective trial on the effect of vegetable consumption on weight loss in females and concluded that increased vegetable intake was a major factor in weight loss in women [150]. Moreover, a diet low in vegetables contributes to obesity and a pro-inflammatory adipokine profile [149]. A healthy pattern consisting of vegetables, fruits, juices, and exercise was found to be inversely associated with abdominal obesity [148].
