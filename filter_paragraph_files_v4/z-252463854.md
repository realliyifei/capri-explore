## (s3) How the intervention will work
(p3.0) Exercise is a planned, structured, and repetitive physical activity for body conditioning [8] that has greater positive effect on severity of LBP than usual care [16]. Exercises for pregnancy-related LBP are similar to those for non-specific LBP [17]. For example, walking, lowimpact aerobic exercise, and adapted yoga and pilates are safe physical activities for pregnancy [13].

(p3.1) Regular physical activity during pregnancy promotes health benefits, such as decreased frequency of gestational diabetes mellitus, prevention of preeclampsia, and improved recovery time during postpartum [13]. Exercise may also reduce pain intensity and disability and improve global functioning [14,18].
