## (s3) Clinical trials of Mg-based stents
(p3.0) In terms of clinical trials of Mg-based stents, Biotronik Company implanted 123 "DREAMS 2G ′′ stents into 123 patients with coronary heart disease to assess the availability and safety of the stents. The clinical results demonstrated that complete degradation of "DREAMS 2G ′′ stents occurred 9 months after implantation. The 12-month followup results showed that "DREAMS 2G ′′ stent had good safety and that the late lumen loss (LLL) of the lesion was about 0.39 ± 0.27 mm, implying that "DREAMS 2G ′′ stent owned many advantages such as better radial support, higher vascular compliance, lower acute rebound rate, and no cardiac death or stent thrombosis after implantation [79]. "DREAMS 2G ′′ stents obtained the certification of CE and, in June 2016, became the first biodegradable Mg alloy stent marketed in Europe under the trade name Magmaris [79]. Moreover, Biotronik Company carried out a clinical trial (code-named "BIOSOLVE-III") to further evaluate the efficacy of Magmaris. The follow-up results confirmed that Magmaris was safe and effective [84]. Although the studies mentioned above have fully demonstrated the safety of Mg alloy stents, the problems of excessive degradation rate and insufficient endothelialization need to be further resolved to meet the radial support required for the gradual reconstruction of blood vessels.
