## (s21) A closer look at applications of Deep Learning in solving memory forensics challenges 9.1 Introduction
(p21.0) In the field of computer security, memory forensics is security-oriented forensic analysis of a computer's memory dump. Memory forensics can be conducted against OS kernels, user-level applications, as well as mobile devices. Memory forensics outperforms traditional disk-based forensics because although secrecy attacks can erase their footprints on disk, they would have to appear in memory [45]. The memory dump can be considered as a sequence of bytes, thus memory forensics usually needs to extract security semantic information from raw memory dump to find attack traces. Several challenges exist in memory forensics such as lack of adequate domain knowledge, lack of robustness and low efficiency. Researchers have been using Deep Learning to address these challenges [45][46][47][48].
