## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a family of enveloped viruses with a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome. CoVs cause illness ranging from upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) resembling the common cold to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with most serious disease outcomes in the elderly, immunocompromised patients, and infants [1,2]. HCoV-OC43 (OC43), HCoV-229E (229E), HCoV-NL63 (NL63), and HCoV-HKU1 (HKU1) were the first documented human CoVs (HCoVs), which usually cause URTIs and less frequently are associated with LTRI diseases [3]. In the last decades, two human coronaviruses created great concern for the world medical community due to significant disease and mortality [4,5]. In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was characterized by acute atypical pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in roughly 8000 patients and with almost 800 deaths, representing a nearly 10% mortality rate [6]. More recently, in 2012, a new human coronavirus, designated as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified, and the global ongoing outbreak of MERS with over 2519 official cases and 866 deaths represented approximately 34% case fatality rate to date in humans [7].
## (s2) Pathogenic Mechanism of Coronavirus-Induced Cell Damage
(p2.0) The high mortality rate associated with the three pathogenic HCoVs has been mainly attributed to the development of digestive and respiratory tract injuries observed following infection. Acute atypical pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage that progress to deposition of fibrous tissue, denuded airways, haemorrhage, and elevated macrophage infiltration are sometimes accompanied by watery diarrhoea, dehydration, and vomiting [2,12,13]. Despite the molecular mechanisms of coronavirusinduced intestine and lung pathogenesis not fully elucidated and still unclear, studies have suggested that late-term disease progression is unrelated to viremia. It is now believed more likely to be associated with the immunopathological mechanism [14,15]. Viral clearance and subsequent recovery from infection require activation of an effective host immune response; however, many immune effector cells may also cause injury to host tissues [16]. Together with inflammatory and immune response signaling, the presence of oxidative compounds, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays important roles in the pathogenic mechanism of cell damage induced by CoVs through oxidative stress [17].
## (s4) Effect of Natural Antioxidants in Coronavirus Infections
(p4.0) This review focused on studies reporting on the anticoronavirus activity of natural antioxidants. Based on exclusion criteria, data from nineteen compounds were discussed. The oxidative stress pathway could potentially be a key element in coronavirus-induced apoptosis and pathogenesis [104]. For this reason, it is interesting to investigate the use of antioxidants as potential therapeutic tools-either as an alternative or as an adjuvant to conventional therapies-in the treatment of coronavirus infections. Among the antioxidant compounds evaluated as for coronavirus infections are the flavonoids, which are compounds widely found in fruits, vegetables, and certain beverages. In fact, research groups have reported that antioxidant flavonoids, including (+)-catechin, luteolin, apigenin, quercetin, and quercetin 7rhamnoside, inhibit ROS accumulation and apoptosis of cells infected with different coronavirus, including porcine epidemic diarrhoea coronavirus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) [105][106][107].
