## (s12) (Un)coupling and ROS
(p12.0) Glucocorticoids inhibited the activity of the uncoupling proteins UCP-1 and UCP-3 in brown adipose tissue [121] thereby increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, but up-regulated UCP-2 in microvascular endothelial cells [122]. No effects were seen in skeletal muscle [117]. Induction of uncoupling is regulated by both glucocorticoid-and mineralocorticoid receptors, to which these hormones bind with varying affinity. Although uncoupling increases oxygen consumption while decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and energy substrate availability, it could also be an adaptive mechanism to limit harmful production of mitochondrial ROS [122]. Chronic exposure to corticosteroids is, however, related to an increase in ROS production [86].
## (s16) The innate immune system
(p16.0) Despite their generally anti-inflammatory effects, glucocorticoids appear to act in a biphasic manner. Low doses of endogenous glucocorticoids, or exposure to this hormone without an additional inflammatory stimulus, can enhance pathways involved in the innate immune response by up-regulating PRRs, cytokine receptors and complement factors. This includes aiding differentiation of macrophages, promoting phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and debris by monocytes and macrophages, and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion [155]. Expression of pro-and anti-inflammatory genes are regulated via NF-ÎºB and AP-1 or by post-translational protein modification [155]. In contrast, glucocorticoids exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, impairing phagocytosis in macrophages, increasing apoptosis of neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils, and decreasing antigen presentation and co-stimulation by dendritic cells which will ultimately affect the adaptive immune system [155][156][157].
