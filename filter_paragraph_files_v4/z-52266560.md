## (s17) 1-D ionospheric currents and FAC determination from low-orbiting satellite magnetic data
(p17.0) Magnetic data of a low-orbiting satellite can be used to determine both ionospheric currents and FAC if the situation can well be approximated as 1-D (see above), by expanding the magnetic disturbance recorded by the satellite into 1-D SECS.Similar to the techniques presented in Sects.3.3 and 7.1, the data is used to calculate optimum scaling factors of the 1-D SECS, which in turn determine both the ionospheric currents and FAC.This approach has first been presented by Juusola et al. (2006), and shown to be superior to previously used techniques to calculate ionospheric currents from satellite data (e.g.Olsen, 1996).One major advantage of using 1-D SECS for this type of analysis is that by placing SECS poles at certain distances, a spatial scale is selected naturally, which is the same for both components of the resulting ionospheric currents and for the FAC.Therefore, it makes sense to combine the results for the different current components for further analysis, even though the magnetic field caused by the FAC is local to the satellite while the one caused by the ionospheric currents is remote.It should be noted that the 1-D SECS technique also makes it possible to analyze low-orbiting satellite and ground-based magnetometer data simultaneously, by combining the techniques of Sect.7.1 and of this section into a single 1-D SECS expansion.This technique has been extensively used with data of the CHAMP satellite (e.g.Ritter et al., 2004), which passes over the auroral ionosphere at about 400 km altitude.Juusola et al. (2007) have analyzed more than 6000 passes between 55 • and 76.5 • northern geomagnetic latitude during 2001 and 2002 which satisfy their 1-D condition.In order to crosscheck the resulting ionospheric currents with results from ground-based magnetometer analysis, the authors selected passes of CHAMP over the MIRACLE network (Fig. 1), and used the technique presented in Sect.3.3 to determine the 2-D ionospheric equivalent currents from the MIRACLE data.They then compared 1-D profiles of these results along each CHAMP overpass with the results of ionospheric currents from the 1-D SECS analysis of the CHAMP data.As can be seen from Fig. 9, the correspondence between the two is very good with a correlation coefficient of 0.9, especially when taking into account that the ground-based technique provides equivalent currents and the satellite-based technique real ones.In practice, the results of Juusola et al. (2007) show that the ground-based and satellite results are interchangeable when the satellite passes over a ground magnetometer array.Juusola et al. (2007) combined the results of all CHAMP passes into a statistical study of the dependence of ionospheric currents and FAC of the general geomagnetic activity level, of season, and of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).As an example, Fig. 10 shows the dependence of J r (FAC), J θ and J φ of the IMF, in addition to the data coverage for each IMF bin, as a function of geomagnetic latitude and MLT.Further, in a 1-D case it is possible to calculate the value of the Hall-to-Pedersen conductance ratio α from the magnetic data alone, simply as
