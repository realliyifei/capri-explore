## (s4) Screening and diagnosis
(p4.0) As substance use among older adults continues to rise, effective screening and diagnosis will become increasingly critical. The benefits of early detection and treatment of SUDs can have dramatic implications for overall physical and mental wellbeing in older adults. When examining SUD treatment admissions, patients were mostly referred by an individual (patient or other non-provider) or the criminal justice system. Healthcare providers accounted for only 12.8% of referrals for older adults to substance abuse treatment programs, perhaps suggesting that there is room for improvement in the screening and discussion of SUDs in older adults [6]. While office assessment through history taking might elicit discussion of substance use, this is limited by patient discomfort with reporting stigmatized behavior; however, barriers to more formal screening include lack of time and challenges integrating screening into clinic workflow [7].
## (s10) Epidemiology
(p10.0) Although it has become increasingly legalized in the U.S., cannabis remains a federally illegal drug and is classified as illicit in substance use literature. As such, it is considered the most prevalent form of illicit substance use by older adults in the U.S. 4 Over recent years, cannabis has become less stigmatized and more accepted by the general public. Among older adults, the perceived risk of regular cannabis use has significantly decreased from 52.0% to 42.7% from 2015 to 2019 [31]. The demographic subgroups with the largest reductions in perceived risk were those never married, men, and those who lived in states where medical cannabis was legal [31]. Importantly, those with chronic disease and high-risk behaviors, including tobacco and binge alcohol use, also had significant decreases in perceived risk [31]. Older adults with high-risk behaviors are already at particular risk for harm, and the changing perceptions of cannabis use in this group can potentially lead to more consequences [31].

(p10.1) The prevalence of past-year cannabis use among adults 65 years and older increased significantly, from 3.3% to 6.0%, between 2016 and 2020 [3]. Han et al. evaluated which demographic characteristics were associated with significant relative increase in cannabis use from 2015 to 2018 and found that the characteristics associated with significant relative change included women (93.3% change), individuals of white and nonwhite races/ethnicities (42.9% and 336.4%, respectively), individuals with a college education (113.8%), those with total family incomes of $20,000 to $49,000 and $75,000 or greater (138.5% and 129.2%, respectively), and married individuals (100%) [32]. Individuals who received mental health treatment in the past year had a 157.1% relative increase in cannabis use during this time [32]. Interestingly enough, the increase in cannabis use appeared to be driven largely by older adults who did not have multiple chronic medical conditions [32]. In addition to this, there was a 117.2% relative increase in cannabis use among older adults who use alcohol [32]. One qualitative study showed that older adults mainly used cannabis for medicinal reasons, but none received cannabis prescriptions from their family physicians and the main sources of information regarding cannabis use were from friends, cannabis store staff, and the media [33].
## (s16) Epidemiology
(p16.0) The prevalence of opioid prescriptions in older adults continues to increase [54]. As the population ages, there are increasing indications-whether appropriate or not-for opioids in older adults. Older adults have higher rates of chronic pain, and opioid prescription fill rates were disproportionately higher among adults aged 65 years or older from 2008-2018 [55]. Han et al. found that, among adults 65 years and older, an estimated 1.2% reported past-year prescription opioid misuse in 2015-2016 [56].
## (s20) Special considerations in older adults
(p20.0) Benzodiazepines should be carefully monitored in older adults. Studies have shown conflicting results on whether benzodiazepines are associated with cognitive decline or dementia [68,69], and if so, whether there is a dosedependent response pattern [70]. Conflicting results are likely due to large heterogeneity in demographics across and within different studies. More research must be conducted to clarify the relationship between benzodiazepine use and cognitive function in older adults; although this relationship remains unclear, there are many other well studied reasons to avoid benzodiazepine use in older adults, including sedation, drowsiness, ataxia, and dizziness [71]. In addition to this, long-term benzodiazepine use is well known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal-induced delirium, seizures, and death [72].
## (s22) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
(p22.0) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13% of Americans reported increasing or starting substance use to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020 [75]. The existing literature suggests that there was an overall trend towards increased alcohol consumption and a clear trend towards increased use of other substances use in the general population during COVID-19 [76]. While the COVID-19 pandemic has caused psychosocial stressors and economic strain for all adults with SUDs, older adults are disproportionately affected, as they are already at increased risk for social isolation, which can be detrimental when patients rely on interactions with both formal and informal supports to maintain sobriety [77]. To counteract this, there has been a dramatic increase in telehealth availability, particularly in the treatment of SUDs [78]. Studies have shown virtual outpatient care for the treatment of SUD to be a feasible alternative to in-person-only programming [79]. However, access to these virtual programs can be limited by advanced age as older adults might have limited computer literacy, limited access to internet and technology, or hearing loss. Older adults also might prefer inperson visits, as suggested in a qualitative study of older adults in treatment for AUD during COVID-19, where they considered face-to-face provision to be essential [80]. As the popularity of telehealth continues to increase, it will be of utmost importance to address the structural barriers for accessing telehealth treatment for older adults and to adapt such services to increase engagement in older people, their caregivers, and healthcare providers.
## (s24) Barriers to treatment in the older population
(p24.0) Despite increasing rates of substance use in older adults, the number of referrals made by healthcare providers for substance use treatment has been declining [6]. In addition to this, only 18% of substance abuse treatment programs are specifically designed for the geriatric population. Older adults face unique barriers to treatment such as social isolation, limited mobility, financial problems, transportation issues, and shame regarding substance use [5]. Choi et al. found that lack of readiness and cost/limited insurance were the most frequently mentioned barriers to treatment among older adults [85]. The abundance of missed opportunities for screening and treating older adults with substance use problems will have devastating consequences if they are not appropriately addressed moving forward.
