## (s22) Electrical conductivity
(p22.0) Silk by itself is a relatively poor conductor for electricity and can only provide scaffold fibers for other conductors (Steven et al. 2013). The conductivity of such an hybrid structure however depends on the relative humidity of the context, from 40% of humidity, the conductivity of the fiber will increase linearly (Steven et al. 2011). Conductivity also depends on the coating of the thread, studies so far describe threads coated with iodine, carbon nanotubes or gold, giving possibilities for the hybrids material to ally spider silk mechanic characteristics and conductivity of well-known superconductors (Steven et al. 2011). Both spider and Bombyx silk have been hybridized with other materials, respectively, carbon nanotubes and BEDT-TTF (based organic molecular conductor) and shown the unique properties of the silks topping the conductivity of these materials (supercontraction, elasticity, resistance, thermic properties) (Steven et al. 2014). Spider silk's fibroin has also been used in the conception of electronical devices (memristor) for its biodegradable features and ease of preparation (Sun et al. 2015).
