## (s1) Role of DNA repair in carcinogenesis and therapy
(p1.0) Unfortunately, the current treatment does not provide sufficient results compared to the resulting side effects, which have a negative impact on patient's quality of life (QOL). Nowadays, cancer therapeutics can be a major challenge, when it comes to seeking personalized targeted medicine that is both effective and selective to the malignancy [26]. Characteristic feature of a cancer cells is genomic instability which is associated with a greater tendency to accumulation of a DNA damage. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy leads to the DNA lesions of a cancer cells, thus causing their death [27]. However, a part of them is able to survive in genotoxic stress afforded by therapy due to increased DNA repair [28]. They have an impaired DDR pathway so they can only depend on a sole backup pathway for their survival. The use of inhibitors directed against the essential components of this process could be a promising strategy to eradicate cancer cells. Aberrant epigenetic changes in DNA damage repair genes may also serve as therapeutic targets [29,30]. Numerous studies are currently performed in order to relate the activation of a DNA repair genes in cancer cells to the low effectiveness of therapy.
