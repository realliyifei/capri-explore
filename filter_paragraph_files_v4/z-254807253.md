## (s6) REOPERATION, DESPITE ITS HIGH MORTALITY AND RISK, IS SOMETIMES THE LAST SALVAGE TREATMENT
(p6.0) Considering the complicated conditions and high risks, most scholars do not choose reoperation for the patients with anastomotic leaks. However, some scholars insist on the applicability, in some special cases, such as a large defect caused by massive gastric tissue necrosis which is difficult to heal in a short time or serious clinical symptoms, unless patients cannot tolerate the second operation. The operation methods mainly include simply defect repair, anastomotic reconstruction and esophageal exclusion. 31,32 With the application of new technologies such as interventional therapy, endoscopy and negative pressure therapy in the treatment of anastomotic leak, conservative treatment of a "minimally invasive" nature has more prominent advantages than the "trauma" of reoperation. In fact, at present, a nonsurgical treatment strategy is generally adopted in patients with simple anastomotic leak, and reoperation is usually only suitable for patients with complex and serious cases.
