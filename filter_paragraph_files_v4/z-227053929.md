## (s10) Hyper-parameter selection
(p10.0) In addition to parameters that are learned during the training process, many ML models also require hyper-parameters. Examples of such hyper-parameters are the depth of a decision tree, the number of hidden layers in a neural network or the number of neighbors in k-Nearest Neighbors classifier. Hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) is the process of choosing the optimal setting of these hyper-parameters. Most HPO techniques involve multiple training cycles of the ML model. This is computationally challenging because in the worst case the size of the HPO task grows exponentially: each new hyper-parameter adds a new dimension to the search space. As discussed by Yang and Shami [57], these considerations make HPO techniques very expensive and resourceheavy in practice, especially for applications of deep learning. Even approaches like Hyperband [58] or Bayesian optimization [59], that are specifically designed to minimize the number of training cycles needed, are not yet able to deal with the high dimensional searches that emerge when many hyper-parameters are involved. Large datasets complicate matters by leading to long training times for each search.
