## (s10) Antitumor Activity
(p10.0) Many studies have shown that polysaccharides from the Araliaceae family, especially ginseng polysaccharides, exhibit anti-tumor activity in cell and animal models. In peritoneal macrophage and leukemia cell models, ginseng polysaccharide (GPS) stimulated macrophages to increase the levels of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and nitric oxide (NO) production against leukemia [88]. In malondialdehyde (MDA)-MB-231 breast cancer cells, GPS activated p65-IKZF1 signaling and apoptosis to inhibit cell proliferation [89]. In HCT-116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells, ginseng berry polysaccharide extract (GBPE) and its purified fragment, GBPP, significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion and Th1 and Treg cell differentiation to suppress cell growth [90]. In B16-BL6 melanoma, GBPP exhibited a function similar to that observed in colon cancer [18]. Similarly, NFP, which is a polysaccharide from Korean red ginseng, inhibited melanoma cell metastasis to the lung, which may have resulted due to its immunity-enhancing effect [91]. Furthermore, a polysaccharide from ginseng leaves, GS-P, promoted macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells to exhibit anti-metastatic activity against colon cancer [92].
