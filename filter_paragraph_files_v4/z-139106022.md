## (s42) BOHB
(p42.0) BOHB  is a composed solver for the CASH problem. It is a combination of Bayesian optimization and hyperband (Li et al., 2018). A limitation of hyperband is the random generation of the tested configurations. BOHB replaces this random selection by a SMBO procedure. All function evaluations are stored in and modeled by a TPE. New configurations are drawn from l(Î») in Equation (8)   candidate configurations is sampled at random to comply with the theoretical guarantees of hyperband (Li et al., 2018). For each function evaluation, BOHB passes the current budget and a configuration instance to the objective function. The interpretation of the budget is conferred to the user, meaning it can represent basically anything, e.g., the fraction of training data to use, available runtime or number of iterations.
