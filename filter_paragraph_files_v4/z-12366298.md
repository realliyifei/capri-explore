## (s10) Considerations for Treating the Hypertensive Hispanic Patient
(p10.0) For most patients, regardless of ethnicity, multiple antihypertensive agents are needed to attain BP goal. [59] For example, current guidelines from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure [10] state that two or more antihypertensive medications are usually required to achieve BP goals in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease, and for patients whose BP is more than 20 mmHg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mmHg above the diastolic BP goal. For these patients, current guidelines recommend initiation of therapy with two agents, one of which is usually a thiazide diuretic. The choice of a thiazide diuretic as part of an initial treatment regimen is based on the well established observations that drugs in this class are generally well tolerated, can prevent cardiovascular complications associated with hypertension, and are usually cost effective. [10] The combination of a diuretic with a RAAS inhibitor is often recommended as first-line therapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension, given that the RAAS is the central mediator of the majority of hypertension-related complications and that the RAAS is activated in response to pressure-related target-organ damage. [10,11] Compelling indications for RAAS-inhibitorbased combination treatment regimens in the general population include co-morbid cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke prevention, heart failure, and coronary artery disease risk. [10] Although data evaluating the efficacy of RAAS-inhibitor-based therapy in Hispanics are limited, the high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in this population provides rationale for the use of this class of antihypertensive drugs.
