## (s5) Future directions and challenges
(p5.0) Peripheral vascular disease provides a promising target for adipose-derived cell therapies. Pioneering preclinical studies simultaneously published independently by groups in Indianapolis, Toulouse, and Frankfurt -and later confi rmed by others in Japan and Korea -have demonstrated the protective eff ects of both SVF cells and ASCs against acute vascular injuries [35][36][37][38][39][40][41]. Using rodent hind-limb ischemia models, these investigators unequivocally demonstrated that intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection of adipose-derived cells accelerated recovery of blood supply to the damaged tissues and prevented necrosis over a 1-week period. Th e investigators concluded that production of the angiogenic/ vasculogenic cytokines hepatocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor accounted, in part, for the mechanism underlying the ASC and/or SVF cell actions [37,40]. Th ese preclinical studies suggest that ASCs and SVF cells could be used to treat claudication and chronic vascular insuffi ciency in the lower extremities, such as that seen in patients with diabetes and related small-vessel diseases. Consequently, doctors at academic medical centers have begun to submit protocols to their national regulatory authorities for translational clinical trials; however, to date, no phase I safety or effi cacy results have been published.
