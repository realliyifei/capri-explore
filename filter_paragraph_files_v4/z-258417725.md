## (s2) Sources of Selective Pressure: The Environment and Humans
(p2.0) Regardless of the initial process, domestication took place for about 15,000-30,000 years [18,19]. Dogs firstly associated with hunter-gatherers, then humans organized themselves into small settlements, and finally, into larger villages. The analysis of the domestication process, which produced marked differences between wolves and dogs, individuated three types of selective pressures (natural and sexual, human-mediated and improved selection), as depicted by Range and Marshall-Pescini in 2022 (Figure 1) [20].  [20]. The figure summarizes the wolf domestication process and the respective selective pressures that are likely to have been active during the process. Abbreviation: FRD, free-ranging dogs.
## (s5) Wolves vs. Dogs: A Socio-Ecological Clash
(p5.0) Wolves are cursorial predators capable of hunting in groups (pack-hunting specialists) that base their diet mainly on ungulates. Their social organization involves a monogamous pair, accompanied by their offspring, composed of adults, subadults and puppies (nuclear family organization), and sometimes, unrelated individuals join the pack [20]. The size of the pack has a fundamental role in the success rates of hunting and in the defense of the territory, and very often clashes between schools result in lethal aggressions. Overall, it seems that wolves are heavily dependent on their social structure as a cohesive and functional pack, which allows them to get enough food, breed their cubs, and defend the territory [23]. As for dogs, free-ranging dogs show a feeding ecology closely related to the occupied niche in the human environment. Their diet consists mainly of human food waste, and in many populations, hunting (including pack hunting) plays a minor role. They have been considered "optionally social", since the size of the group depends on the abundance of food. In contrast to wolves, they have a much more flexible pack structure, as members of one pack often join another. Regarding the care of the offspring, dogs differ much from wolves. The cubs of free-ranging dogs are bred mainly by mothers [20], while among wolves, the occurrence of cooperative breeding of cubs by the pack with alloparental care is now well known [70].
