## (s38) Imprinting/Soft Molding
(p38.0) A technique of transferring imprinting pattern is called soft molding [35,36]. Figure 20 presents the process of through-hole pattern on a flat PDMS membrane via imprinting/soft molding. Firstly, the PDMS solution was spin-coated to a specific thickness on a substrate with an adhesion reduction layer. Then, a selected mold was carefully placed on the PDMS membrane with an appropriate pressure to displace and penetrate through the uncured PDMS membrane to form the desired patterns. Susquently, the membrane with the mold was fully cured while maintaining the load, hence a desired perforated membrane was sucessfully produced [131]. It is worth mentioning that the volume shrinkage of the photopolymerizable polymer used for imprinting during the photopolymerization was different, resulting in the mold being easily released after imprinting, hence a polymeric membrane with the desired through-holes was obtained [119,136].
