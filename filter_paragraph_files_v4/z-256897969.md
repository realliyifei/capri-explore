## (s2) Drug descriptors used for side effects prediction
(p2.0) In this section, drug descriptors are presented, which have been utilized as an input feature of a supervised computational approach to predict the potential side effects of drugs. A variety of drug descriptors are available for side effects prediction. Some are clinical data (clinical trial data, health surveys, Electronic Health Records (EHR), administrative data, claim data, and disease-patient registries), and some are non-clinical information about drugs (pharmacokinetics, chemical, toxicological, safety, biological, pharmaceutical, pharmacological, and other pre-clinical data) (Lee et al. 2008;Andrade et al. 2016). Both clinical and non-clinical data are widely used for side effects prediction using computational approaches. Further, this drug information can be categorized into chemical (Che), Phenotypic (Phe), Biological(Bio), and other drug descriptors, illustrated in Fig. 1.
