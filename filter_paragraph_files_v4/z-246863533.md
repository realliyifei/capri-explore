## (s1) EFX for restricted valuations:
(p1.0) In [Plaut and Roughgarden, 2020], it was also shown that EFX allocations exist and can be computed in polynomial time when all agents agree on the ordering of the goods with respect to their values. For instances where there are only two distinct possible values that an agent may have for each good, Amanatidis et al. [2021a] showed that EFX allocations exist and can be efficiently computed for any number of agents; later, Garg and Murhekar [2021] showed that this is possible even in conjunction with PO. In fact, Amanatidis et al. [2021a] also demonstrated an interesting connection between EFX and MNW allocations for bi-valued instances, by showing that MNW implies EFX. A similar result was later shown by Babaioff et al. [2021b] for general valuations with binary (i.e., 0 or 1) marginals.

(p1.1) Here, it is instructive to mention that in the related literature, the requirement that the inequality must hold only for positively-valued goods in the definition of Caragiannis et al. [2019b] stated above is o en dropped. is stronger version of EFX is usually called EFX 0 [Kyropoulou et al., 2020]. In the case of binary valuations, a special case of bi-valued instances, the distinction makes a difference but in more general se ings, the existence and computation of EFX 0 allocations can be reduced to the existence and computation of EFX allocations; see [Amanatidis et al., 2021a] for a related discussion. It is easy to see that envy-freeness implies EFX 0 , which implies EFX, which in turn implies EF1.
## (s6) Open Problem 7. Does an EFR allocation always exist?
(p6.0) PMMS and GMMS: Several variations of MMS have also been considered. Caragiannis et al. [2019b] defined the notion of pairwise maximin share fairness (PMMS) according to which, for every pair of agents i and j, i's value for A i must be at least as much as the maximum she could obtain by redistributing the set of goods in A i âˆª A j into two bundles and picking the worst of them. In other words, instead of requiring the maximin share guarantee to be achieved for the set of all agents, PMMS requires that it is achieved for any pair of agents. Despite the apparent similarities in the definitions of PMMS and MMS, Caragiannis et al. [2019b] showed that their exact versions are actually incomparable. e main open problem here is the following.
## (s12) Group Fairness
(p12.0) In the model we discussed in the main part of the survey, each agent is assumed to be unrelated to other agents. However, there are applications where it makes more sense for agents to be grouped together (e.g., each group might correspond to a family). Several models capturing scenarios along these lines have been considered in the literature. Suksompong [2018] focused on a se ing where each agent derives full value from all the goods allocated to the group she belongs to, and showed bounds on the best possible approximation of MMS. Kyropoulou et al. [2020] considered EF1 and EFX allocations in the same se ing, as well as in se ings with dynamic group formation; some of these results were later improved by Manurangsi and Suksompong [2021] using ideas from discrepancy theory. Segal-Halevi and Suksompong [2019] focused on the case of democratic fairness, where the goal is to compute allocations that are considered fair (e.g., satisfying EF1) by a high fraction of the agents in each group. A different model was studied by Conitzer et al. [2019], where goods given to a group are then distributed among its members, and thus the agents derive value only from the goods allocated personally to them.
## (s13) Online Fair Division
(p13.0) Our model here is static, as all items, agents, and their valuation functions do not change over time. Online fair division considers se ings where the agents or the goods arrive in an online manner. In the most common model there is a fixed set of agents, items arrive one by one, and they need to be allocated to the agents immediately and irrevocably [Aleksandrov et al., 2015, Aleksandrov andWalsh, 2020]. Usually, in order to bypass strong negative results and show that it is possible for envy to vanish over time or the allocations to always remain EF1, the values of the goods are assumed to be bounded [Benade et al., 2018, Zeng and or a limited number of reallocations is allowed [He et al., 2019]. e alternative model which considers a fixed set of resources and agents who arrive or depart over time has not been considered for indivisible resources, partially because it is very challenging to achieve positive results [Kash et al., 2014].
## (s14) Randomness in Fair Division
(p14.0) Until very recently there were barely any works on randomized algorithms for discrete fair division. is is partially due to the strong general preference for deterministic algorithms / mechanisms within the Computational Social Choice community (which is well-justified in many se ings, yet such a discussion is beyond the scope of this survey), but also due to the nature of the problem itself. On one hand, randomness cannot help with achieving ex-post fairness, i.e., fairness in each resulting allocation, for any of the deterministic notions mentioned herein. On the other hand, achieving ex-ante envy-freeness, i.e., envy freeness with respect to the expected utilities, is trivial; just allocate all the goods to a single agent uniformly at random. Freeman et al. [2020] proposed an algorithm that achieves ex-ante envy-freeness but is also ex-post EF1, i.e., all the possible allocations it outputs are deterministically EF1. Aziz [2020] gave a simpler algorithm with the same fairness guarantees that also satisfies a weak efficiency property. Finally, in a somewhat different direction,  studied interim envy-freeness, a notion which lies between ex-ante and ex-post envy-freeness.
