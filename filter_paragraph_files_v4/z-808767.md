## (s9) B Cells
(p9.0) Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates appear to be pivotal regulators of antibody response both locally in the gut and systemically as mice fed on an MAC-deficient diet have defective homeostatic and pathogen-specific antibody responses (31). In contrast, mice fed on a high-MAC diet had significantly enhanced IgA production compared to mice fed a no-MAC diet (22,31). High-MAC feeding increased T follicular helper response marked by increased germinal center activities in the Peyer's patches, as well as IgA + B cells in the small intestine (22). These effects on B cells are both linked to MAC-induced changes in the gut microbiota composition (22) and to the production of SCFAs as they support B cell antibody production by promoting plasma cell differentiation (31). Kim et al. also demonstrated that MAC deficiency increased C. rodentium disease burden due to reduced antibody production and diminished clearance of C. rodentium. Deficiency in dietary MACs may therefore alter B cell response and predispose to bacterial infection burden.
