## (s24) II. Necrosis may act as an indicator of aggressive behavior in tumors
(p24.0) In addition to this, necrosis has a significant role in indicating aggressive behavior as well as prognosis in some tumors.Solid tumors can grow to a particular size before developing poor vascularization in their core parts, which leads to tumor necrosis.Due to poor vascularization and accompanying metabolic stresses such as hypoxia and food starvation, foci of cell death are frequently seen in the core regions of solid tumors.Since the morphology of dead tumor cells appears to be necrotic, these foci of cell death are referred to as tumor necrosis.Tumor hypoxia, an important hallmark of aggressive cancers, is related to a more stimulatory microenvironment with increased angiogenesis and inflammation as co-existing responses.Tumor necrosis is commonly associated with aggressive tumor development and metastasis. [6]Tumor necrosis has been repeatedly associated with larger, higher grade tumors, and tumors with higher proliferative activity and it is believed that tumor necrosis represents an indirect indicator of biologically aggressive tumor behavior. [6] Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) A high-grade malignant salivary gland tumor is nearly often accompanied by aggressive clinical behavior.Both the tubular and cribriform types of AdCC have a less aggressive clinical behavior than the solid variant.[34] Histopathologically, regions of necrosis as well as cellular pleomorphism and mitoses were shown in Figure 2, [35] which are typically absent in other forms of AdCC and may be observed in the center of solid tumor islands.[36] 2. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) Tumor necrosis is a common occurrence in aggressive cancers when tumor development exceeds the rhythm of neovascularization.Tumor necrosis is frequently accompanied by a chronic inflammatory state, which may lead to aggressive tumor activity.[37] Extended histological analyses that include tumor/stroma ratio, immune infiltration at the front of invasion, tumor budding, and tumor necrosis can be a straightforward, approachable strategy to gather more data on tumor aggressiveness in the skin and mucosal SCC affecting the head and neck regions.[37]
