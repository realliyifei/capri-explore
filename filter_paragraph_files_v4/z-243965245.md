## (s1) METHODOLOGY
(p1.0) This study filtered articles through several stages, from determining search terms, the database to be used for searching, and criteria for selecting papers that would be excluded/included (Snyder 2019). In the first stage, we determined the search terms/keywords being searched on the specified database. According to Snyder (2019), search terms should be based on words and concepts that are directly related to the research question. Therefore, to find articles relevant to the research questions, we employed the following keyword: "key audit matters" and "communicative value". The search databases used were Google Scholar and Web of Science. Google Scholar was used due to its capacity to identify highly-cited documents effectively (Martin-Martin et al. 2017). Furthermore, Martin-Martin et al. (2017) stated that it has a broad search scope without limiting the type and source of search results documents. Moreover, Google Scholar can also be used as the first choice and is sufficient to serve as the sole source for conducting systematic review (Jean-Francois et al. 2013). Ginieis et al. (2012) also use Google Scholar, which is open access, as one of the databases in his systematic literature review research.
