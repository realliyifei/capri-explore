## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in female cancer sufferers in both developed and developing countries [1]. The exact cause(s) of the majority of breast cancers still remains unknown [2]. By far the most effective way to tackle the disease is through early detection, precise identification of women at risk, and applying preventative measures. Within screening mammography, both mammographic density and parenchymal pattern have been established as image-based risk factors [2]. Current studies suggest that mammographic density is a major risk factor, even though it adds only little to the Gail model [3], and it is still not clear how to incorporate the factors as biomarkers into the risk prediction models [4].
## (s6) Screen Mammography
(p6.0) Early detection through breast screening programmes is by far the most effective way to improve survival rate [98]. There are multiple breast imaging modalities; mammography, ultrasound, thermography, PET (positron emission tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computed tomography), scintimammography, optical imaging, and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) based imaging have all been used for different purposes. The clinical role for nonmammographic modalities is often to provide additional information when the results of mammograms are indeterminate or of limited utility [99]. This review focuses on evaluation of density using (X-ray related) mammographic modalities, and other modalities are outside the current scope. The reader is referred to [98] for a detailed overview and [100] for a comparison of breast imaging modalities, and the associated biomarkers used for early detection can be found in [101].
