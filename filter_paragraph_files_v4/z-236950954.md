## (s6) RFB-Net
(p6.0) Currently, existing state-of-the-art detection algorithms use pre-trained backbones based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to extract low-level and high-level features. Instead of relying on a pre-trained backbone, RFB-Net is inspired by the Receptive Fields (RFs) structure in the human visual system. RFB-Net considers the relationship between size and eccentricity of RFs to enhance features. Figure 10 illustrates the main building block of RFB-Net. Figure 10. The explained architecture of RFB [56]. RFB is inspired by Receptive Fields (RFs) in human visual system. RFB considers the relationship between the size and eccentricity of receptive fields into account to enhance the features. (a) RFB is identical to Inception, responsible for simulating the RFs of multiple sizes, and (b) part reproduces the relation between the RF size and eccentricity in the human visual system by using smaller kernels.

## (s18) Deep Saliency Networks
(p18.0) In 2019, Ghose et al. [65] proposed the combination of saliency maps with thermal images to detect pedestrians in poor lighting conditions. This work suggested that instead of relying on thermal and RGB images, the addition of saliency map information to thermal images facilitates the network to identify the objects. At first, the method augments the thermal images by replacing one duplicate channel with a corresponding saliency map. This combination helps illuminate salient parts of the image while preserving textural information. To extract saliency maps, the authors experimented with two state-of-the-art deep saliency networks (PiCA-Net [85] and R3Net [86]).
## (s48) Evaluations for Object Detection in a Challenging Environment
(p48.0) Object detection in a challenging environment is used to distinguish objects from the background and regress their boundaries. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the performance comparison of various methodologies that are explained in Section 3. Different approaches have reported results on specific evaluation metrics. Therefore, we have placed a "-" on the unused metric. By looking at Table 2, apart from [54,65], all the methods have reported results on separate datasets and utilized distinctive evaluation metrics. Therefore, the results summarized in these tables are not directly comparable to each other. Nonetheless, it is evident that there is still much room for improvement in all employed datasets. For instance, the method presented in [63] achieves the AP of 0.49 on SKU-110K dataset. Owing to the challenges present in the dataset (see Section 4.4), the method could only detect objects present in front of the camera or classify multiple objects with a single class. The approach introduced in [57] obtain the AP of 0.34 on the ExDark dataset, which contains dark indoor scenes make object detection even more challenging. Similarly, methods in [54,65] report mAPs of 0.35 and 0.68 on the KAIST dataset, which includes pair of thermal and RGB images taken at night-time or in harsh weather conditions (See Section 4.6). Table 3. Object detection performance analysis in challenging environments. IOU represents intersection over union threshold, whereas mAP and AP denote mean average precision and average precision, respectively. FPS represents frames per second calculated at inference time.
## (s52) Conclusions
(p52.0) With the rapid computational advances, noticeable improvements have been observed by employing deep learning-based object detection algorithms in challenging environments. This paper comprehensively reviews the relevant approaches that have attempted to identify objects under challenging scenarios through deep neural networks and provides an empirical performance analysis of currently employed object detection algorithms. Moreover, the advantages and limitations of all explained techniques are provided. Furthermore, this work describes all the relevant datasets currently exploited to resolve the problem of object detection under challenging environments. This work discusses the well-known evaluation criteria and presents a performance analysis of explained methodologies and object detection algorithms by benchmarking recent object detection algorithms on challenging datasets of ExDark [97], CURE-TSD [92], and Reside [98]. In the end, we highlight the current open issues and present future direction that can enhance the research of object detection under challenging environments.
