## (s10) Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs)
(p10.0) Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) are now widely used in food, cosmetics, agriculture, medical devices and building engineering related processes. Their effects on human health have recently been reviewed. Liver disorders caused by TiO 2 NP were reported to increase the level of serum trans-aminases, LPO and oxidative stress in Wistar rats treated with 300 mg/kg of TiO 2 NP for 14 days by gavage [83]. These researchers showed that glycyrrhizic acid (GA) protected the rats against hepatic injury caused by TiO 2 NP. In vitro and in vivo toxicity of TiO 2 NP enhanced under oxidative stress conditions. A study made on BRL-3A liver cells and in the liver of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat suggested a synergy between oxidative stress and TiO 2 NP induced hepato-toxicity [84]. Further cell death ratio was significantly enhanced (up to 2.62 fold) in BRL-3A cells exposed to OS and TiO 2 NP. A comparative study on the hepatotoxicity of TiO 2 NPs and sodium oleate coated iron oxide nanoparticles (OC-Fe 3 O 4 NPs) was made in Wistar rat [85]. Based on results on redox defences, these researchers concluded that OC-Fe 3 O 4 NPs do affect redox results on serum transaminases and histopathological findings [70]. Coating of AuNPs with citrate and chitosan also affected the hepatotoxicity of AuNPs. Chitosan capped NPs were less toxic than citrate capped ones in Swiss mice. This observation was made by after analysing the inflammation related genes using RT-PCR [71].
