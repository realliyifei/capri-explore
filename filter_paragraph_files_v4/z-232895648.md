## (s26) Domain Transformation
(p26.0) Text to image is an input sentence to generate an image. Due to GAN's excellent performance in graphic image processing, many new models have been created on the result of this kind of domain transformation. Scott et al. proposed GAN-INT-CLS [99], which generates a network that inputs text features to obtain images. Then, GAWWN [100] was proposed by this team to improve the accuracy of the generated images. In terms of image to text, Liu et al. proposed the method of generating poetry through images, which for the first-time incorporated image processing and poetry generation into a framework, making the cognition of machines have the ability to approach human beings [101].
