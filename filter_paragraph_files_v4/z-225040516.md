## (s10) K-NN classifier
(p10.0) The K-NN is a simple machine learning algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies data or case based on a similarity context of the aggregated data. The classification is accomplished by a majority vote of the most common of the predominant class known among its k nearest neighbors. It is also characterized as a lazy algorithm, defined as having less ability and is labor intensive when dealing with large datasets [22,23]. The operation of this algorithm is based on comparing a newly received record with the training records and finding training records identical to it. All training records are stored in an n-dimensional space, and each record with n attributes represents a point in the n-dimensional space.
