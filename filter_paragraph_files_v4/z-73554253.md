## (s37) RV angiography
(p37.0) Many experts still consider right ventricular (RV) angiography as a diagnostic method of choice for assessing RV function [29]. The imaging technique provides angiographic evidence of akinesia or dyskinesia bulging in the triangle of dysplasia ( Figure 1): infundibular, apical, and sub-tricuspid regions, with a high diagnostic specificity > 90% [14,69]. Prominent dilation akinesia accompanied by irregular aspect usually involving inferior RV wall have a significant association with ARVD diagnosis. Recommended RV angiography best evaluates by bi-plane angiography obtaining views in the 450 right anterior oblique and 450 left anterior oblique during sinus rhythm [29]. However, same to cardiac MRI, RV angiography suffers from significant inter-observer variability [12].
## (s50) Study outcomes
(p50.0) The seven studies on ICD therapy demonstrate ARVD patients have good toleration and the therapy provides long-term life-saving protection by preventing lethal ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation or flutter. Further, ICD with non-thoracotomy leads is safe and efficacious in ARVD patients by reducing cases of perforation [101]. Whereas radiofrequency ablation has favorable short-term outcomes by preventing ventricular tachycardia (VT), there is significance recurrence of VT in the longterm because of diffuse nature of ARVD and evolving electrical substrate [104][105][106]. Finally, pharmacotherapy involving β-blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs offer favorable prognosis in the short-term [107-109]. Amiodarone has been shown to have superior protective effect against VT compared to β-blockers and Sotalol [107]. β-blockers taken with amiodarone and programmed electrical stimulation offer better protection against VT [109]. Finally, ICD together with pharmacotherapy provides long-term life-saving protection against VT [104].
