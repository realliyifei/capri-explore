## (s4) Selection of drug, dose, length of treatment
(p4.0) The standard treatment for EC is a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without lymph node dissection with pelvic washing, sometimes combine with adjuvant chemoterapy or radiotherapy is necessary. Although this is a highly effective approach, carrying a 5-year survival rate of 93%, it also results in a permanent loss of reproductive potential which is often unacceptable to younger women who wish to preserve their fertility. Therefore, selected patients with EC, are candidates for a conservative approach (2). Hence, fertility-sparing treatment with progestin is a good compromise for these women. Recently, hysteroscopic resection in addition to hormonal therapy followed by pregnancies in young women have been reported (17,18).
