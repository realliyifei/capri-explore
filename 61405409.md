Challenges and Opportunities: A Report of the 1998 Library Survey of Internet Users at Seton Hall University
November 1998272ADB74F67586114C5B5D0C02F20DE3
This survey aims to collect data to enable Seton Hall University librarian faculty and administration to analyze user satisfaction with information services provided through the Internet's World Wide Web.Seton Hall faculty and students completed 786 questionnaires.About 80 percent of the respondents reported that they used the Web on a daily or weekly basis.The results reveal valuable information about the Internet users' search strategies and their levels of satisfaction in using the Web.Analysis of the data suggests three challenges for academic librarians and five opportunities in providing Internet information services.

he Internet has become an im portant component of elec tronic services in academic li braries.In an ALA survey, Mary J. Lynch reported that 87 percent of aca demic libraries of doctorate-granting in stitutions included in the survey provided information access through home pages on the Web; 84 percent provided formal Internet training for faculty; and 90 per cent provided student training. 1In a na tional survey sponsored by the U.S. Na tional Commission on Libraries and Information Science, researchers John C. Bertot, Charles R. McClure, and Douglas L. Zweizig reported that the top three most important benefits of connecting to the Internet were the ability of libraries to: (1) access electronic Internet-based in formation; (2) communicate with other professionals, libraries, and the public; and (3) enhance reference service capabilities. 2ton Hall University Library created its home pages in 1995. 3 The initial focus of the site was to provide information access to library services and resources.These resources include the library's on line catalog (SetonCat), periodical title database, CD-ROM listing, and descrip tions of various library services.The 1995 pages also included a limited number of online resources including Encyclopaedia Britannica and Project Muse.

In October 1997, the library's home pages were restructured and redesigned under the leadership of Arthur W. Häfner, dean of university libraries.The URL for the library Web site is <www.shu.edu/library>.The new structure and design strategically focus on gateway access to worldwide academic resources.In addi tion, the site strengthens the base of local information featured in the earlier home pages.The revitalized site extends be


## Purpose

The purpose of this survey is to collect data that will enable the university librar ian faculty and administration to analyze student and faculty satisfaction with gate way global information services provided through the Web.This study is a descrip tive survey. 4It is concerned primarily with certain aspects of student and fac ulty use of the Internet's Web.The objec tive of the study, in general terms, is to serve as "an aid . . . in planning, improv ing public relations, and even marketing." 5


## Survey Instrument

The survey instrument described in this re search was pilot-tested by eight persons: four students, two faculty members, and two out side readers.It was modified based on their responses and suggestions.The in strument attempts to elicit answers to the fol lowing questions:

1. Who is using the Internet and the library's home pages?


## Data Collection

In Applied Statistics, John Neter, William Wasserman, and G. A. Whitemore state that a census of a finite population is a study that includes every element of the population, and a census is appropriate when it is easy to reach everyone included in the study. 6In Descriptive Statistical Tech niques for Librarians, Arthur W. Häfner  Each faculty member was asked for his or her cooperation for the fol lowing activities:

1. completing the ques tionnaire;

2. selecting one or more classes of students randomly from their teaching assign ment;

3. distributing the cop ies of the cover letter and questionnaire to stu dents;

4. allowing students five to ten min utes to complete the questionnaire; 5. collecting the completed question naires and returning them to the re searcher through the campus mail.

Survey instruments were distributed the week after the university's spring re cess (March 16, 1998).Between March 19 and May 7, 1998, seventy-seven faculty members, or 17 percent of the 450 in cluded in the study, returned 786 com pleted questionnaires.In situations where a student received the questionnaire in more than one class, he or she was in structed to complete only one survey.Twenty-eight (6% of the 450) of the re turns were invalid because of undeliverable campus mail.A possible cause may have been a mismatch between the names of the faculty and their department addresses.The author inferred what department a faculty member might be in according to the descriptions in the registration handbook of the courses that he or she teaches.

In Survey Research Methods, Floyd J. Fowler Jr. remarked that a 5 to 20 percent  With this caution in mind, the author qualifies the survey projection to the fac ulty and students who are interested in using the Internet only, rather than the entire population of the university.

To analyze the data, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was employed.Data from the survey instru ments were coded and subjected to SPSS.Frequency tabulations were applied to ob tain descriptive measures of the responses.


## Results


## Reer lemographice

Table 1 shows that of the 786 survey instru ments, 596 (75.8%) were completed and re turned to the author from undergraduate students, 160 (20.4%) from graduate students, and 30 (3.8%) from fac ulty members.

Table 2 shows that most responses (677, or 86.2%) were from three academic majors: arts & sciences (351, or 44.7%), business (183, or 23.3%), and education (143, or 18.2%).Other responses (87, or 11%) were from academic majors including nursing (41, or 5.2%), medical education (32, or 4.1%), theology (13, or 1.7%), and diplo macy (1, or 0.1%).


## Internet Use Frequency and Satisfaction Levels

Table 3 shows that most respondents used the Web on a daily (316, or 40.2%), weekly (301, or 38.3%), and monthly (84, or 10.7%) basis.Seventy-seven respondents (about 10%) said they seldom or never used the Internet.

Table 4 shows that students and fac ulty searched the Internet for information related to both their academic (654, or 83.2%) and nonacademic studies (581, or 73.8%).

On a scale of five levels of satisfaction, one is used to indicate the highest level and five the lowest.In table 5, most re spondents placed their levels of satisfac tion for Internet search results at level two (284, or 36.1%) and level three (291, or


## Internet Search Results and Problems

Table 6 shows that 185 (23.6%) of respon dents spent 11 to 20 minutes on search ing to obtain satisfactory results, 241 (30.7 %) spent 21 to 30 minutes, and 264 (33.5%) spent 30+ minutes.Only 39 (5%) of the respondents achieved satisfactory results in less than 10 minutes.Table 7 identifies three major problems encountered by users when searching the Internet:

1. do not find information needed (387, or 49.2%); 2. no full-text information can be cited for academic study and/or research (344, or 43.7%);

3. too many hits (302, or 38.5%).


## Use of University Library Home Pages

Table 8 shows that less than half of the respondents (325, or 41.4%) visited the library's home pages when conducting their research.


## Internet Search Strategies

Table 10 shows that students and faculty (657, or 83.6%) regard using Internet search engines as a preferred way to search the Internet, followed by directly entering a URL or Web address (502, or 63.9%).Using categorized gateway Inter net resource listings (140, or 17.8%) and subscription databases (95, or 12.1%) were alternate ways of searching the Internet.An explanation for the relatively low use of the subscription databases is that they had only been available on the library's home pages for less than two months be fore the survey was conducted.

Table 11


## Internet Search Training

Table 12 shows the opinions of respondents concerning A significant number of respondents who marked "other" commented that they felt it a personal responsibility to learn to search the Internet effectively.More faculty members in the survey iden tified the responsibility as belonging to the librarian faculty (10 out of 30, or 33.3%) than to the academic college (3 out of 30, or 10%).Undergraduate students identified the responsibility as belonging to academic colleges (271 out of 596, or 45.5%) rather than the librarian faculty (92 out of 596, or 15.4%).

Table 13 identifies which Internet train ing courses the respondents would likely attend if the courses were offered by the librarian faculty.Respondents indicated that they were most interested in learn ing advanced Internet searching skills (434, or 55.2%), followed by basic Inter net searching (347, or 44.2%), gateway In ternet resource listings (240, or 30.6%), and subscription databases (192, or 24.4%).


## Discussion


## Diallussuo

The main challenge for Seton Hall Uni versity librarians appears to be how to raise the users' level of satisfaction when providing information services through the Internet.The Internet has become an important source of information for aca demic studies as demonstrated in the sur vey that 617 (78.5%) of the 786 student and faculty respondents used it on a daily or weekly basis.Although the Internet has great potential as a delivery system for both information and instruction, 77 (about 10%) students and faculty indi cated they had seldom or never used the Internet.The study also showed that only  People's expectations have risen along with the improvement of information technology.

The results the users obtained within 30 min utes on the Internet might have taken them a few hours or days before this type of search ing was available to researchers.Another challenge for academic librar ians is to find ways to assist students and faculty in their use of the Internet.The three major problems that respondents encounter when searching the Internet are: (1) do not find information needed, (2) no full-text information can be cited for academic study and/or research, and (3) too many hits.An easy solution to the problem of too many hits is to teach us ers better (narrower) search strategies.

The third challenge for academic li brarians is to find ways to provide effec tive Internet search training.This issue is important because the students tend to believe that the responsibility of teaching them Internet searching belongs to uni versity computing services and/or indi vidual academic colleges.Of course, li brary faculty must continue discussions within the academic community to make sure that this area of teaching is their re sponsibility.


## Conclusions Cooortusitins

The three challenges identified above present five additional opportunities for academic librarians:

1.The high percentage of students and faculty who use the Web on a daily or weekly basis for their academic stud ies affirms that information access deliv ered through the Internet is becoming an important component of library services in tomorrow's library.

2. Academic librarians will find that they need to reallocate budget resources to expand the availability of electronic resources for students and faculty.This will likely take the form of Internet de livery of commercial full-text databases.Internet access will be seen as an advan tage for eliminating or reducing the need for CD-ROM towers, for receiving more timely updates from the database provid ers, and for providing 24-hour access to academic resources for students and fac ulty both on campus and in homes and offices.

3. In providing Internet training, aca demic librarians need to initiate and strengthen their relationships with their institution's computing services and also


## Suggestionsf orfFurtherfInvestigations

A number of further investigations can be suggested as a result of this survey:

## �A

Seton Hall University Library In ternet User Survey should be conducted on a regular basis to compare possible changes in users' Internet search strate gies and levels of satisfaction.�Theimpact of Internet search train ing offered by academic librarians on user satisfaction should be studied.�Experimentswith providing Webbased bibliographic instructions through the library's home pages should be performed.

## TABLE 12 Student and Faculty Opinions on Who Should Be Responsible for Teaching Them How to Search the Internet Effectively (question 12)

Academic librarians need to effec tively integrate the use of Internet search engines into instruction programs and at the reference desk because 657 (83.6%) of the 786 respondents reported that using search engines is a preferred way to search the Internet.Also, librarians need to view Yahoo as a database of signifi cance because 633 (80.5%) of the 786 re spondents identified it as a key resource.5.Academic librarians who have de veloped home pages need to find ways to publicize them because only 325 (41.4%) of the 786 respondents reported that they visited the library's home pages.Academic librarians may wish to use the library's home pages to expand instruc tional programs for traditional biblio graphic instruction by developing Webbased, self-paced teaching courses that allow students to learn and use academic library resources, online databases, and general Internet search.

An instruc tional strength for academic librarianswould be to work in academic partnership with classroom faculty to teach students how to effectively locate scholarlyinformation and how to evaluate siteswhere information is found. A measure of success can be realized by helping students learn how to reduce the number ofunrelated hits. Academic librarians maycombine Internet search training withteaching about traditional library resources of books and journals. Not every thing can be found on the Internet, andoften it is quicker to find the informationby looking at print materials.4.
