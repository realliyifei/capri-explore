## INTRODUCTION

Competition in the food industry is increasingly rife, requiring business actors in this field to always use relevant strategies to the developments in the conditions of their business environment.Hence, they can maintain a sustainable competitive advantage against similar companies and continue to exist in their business environment.To survive among many competitors, the sellers need to do online and offline marketing.Along with the development of the times, the digital era that offers many conveniences can be utilized by online promotions.Online promotions have the advantage of widely reaching the desired target market and saving expenses from offline promotions.

As technology develops, communicating or exchanging messages with other people has a specific purpose.One way to reach this target is with persuasion techniques that try to influence and convince the person receiving the message.This type of communication is commonly used in marketing communications.It cannot be denied that the development of information technology can make it easier for sellers to communicate with buyers regardless of distance.Promotional activities carried out through social media can strengthen relationships that are established initially due to buying and selling activities to become emotional relationships such as friendship.For this reason, social media marketing provides significant opportunities to build correlations
I N P R E S S
between customers and brands (Utami & Saputri, 2020).Communication between humans can occur in the form of symbols, images, or writing, either directly or indirectly, to get a response in the form of feedback, which is expected to become a change in thinking and behavior (Koesomowidjojo, 2021).According to Nguyen (2020), social media marketing has a positive impact on consumer engagement and purchase intention.However, further research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of consumer behavior related to social media marketing.

The utilization of social media platforms like Instagram as an online promotional platform holds immense potential in shaping customer engagement relationships and driving customer interest.The previous research suggests that businesspeople who use Instagram are still not optimal in using existing features, leading researchers to consider the effect of customer engagement by using social media Instagram in promoting, which can change customer decisions to buy products (Sholihah, 2018).

In the ever-evolving digital era, social media has emerged as a powerful tool for reaching and engaging a broad target market.Particularly in Indonesia, Instagram boasts a substantial user base.It offers features that enable culinary businesses like Bandeng Isi MRB to effectively communicate promotional messages, provide educational content, and captivate the attention of prospective customers.The name of Bandeng Isi MRB comes from the abbreviation of "Masakan Rumah Bunda" (mother's home cooking).It has characteristics related to the manual process of deboning milkfish.Furthermore, the distinctive characteristic of Bandeng Isi MRB lies in its target market segmentation, which is the age group of 35 to 44.Table 1 shows the data insight of its Instagram account.One way to increase the purchase of Bandeng Isi MRB is by marketing activities with Instagram.This marketing activity is carried out to establish a good relationship with customers of Bandeng Isi MRB.Customer engagement, which includes physical, cognitive, and emotional involvement, builds a correlation between customers and companies, resulting in an interest in buying a product or service (Adenia, 2019).

The research has a primary focus on exploring how the utilization of Instagram as an online promotional tool influences both customer engagement and the purchasing intention of customers in relation to Bandeng Isi MRB products.The main aim is to determine whether the effective use of Instagram can establish a strong connection between Bandeng Isi MRB as the seller and potential customers, ultimately influencing their inclination to make purchases.To achieve this objective, the researchers set out to investigate the impact of customer engagement on customer purchase intention, specifically within the context of Bandeng Isi MRB, a culinary product, and its online promotion via Instagram.The research delves into some various online marketing strategies and engagement techniques employed to capture and maintain customer interest, encouraging them to purchase the product.

Previous research findings emphasize the significant impact of various factors on consumer behavior and marketing strategies.For example, Bushara et al. (2023) highlighted that perceived value, engagement, and loyalty positively influenced purchase intention, willingness to pay more, and electronic Word-of-Mouth (e-WoM).They suggested the importance of creating a positive e-WoM environment for restaurants.Next, Cuong (2020) underscored the connection between customer satisfaction, brand loyalty, and brand love, with a positive brand image enhancing customer satisfaction.Furthermore, Hasaballah et al. (2019) emphasized the mediating role of trust and commitment in the relationship between relational contextual variables and export performance.They focused on the significance of relational variables in strategic decisions.Lastly, Hur et al. (2018) revealed that customer engagement in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives led to customer citizenship behavior, mediated by customer-company identification and affective commitment.They highlighted the implications for building strong customer relationships in the service industry.These findings collectively shed light on the complex dynamics influencing consumer behavior and marketing strategies.

Moreover, in studies conducted by Oswald and Mascarenhas (2019), Pan et al. (2021), Ram andSun (2020), andTilaar et al. (2023), various aspects of business and consumer behavior are explored.For example, Oswald and Mascarenhas (2019) emphasized the critical role of trust in corporate relationships, highlighting its impact on communication, teamwork, and overall business success.Moreover, Pan et al. (2021) showcased the positive influence of green packaging on consumer behavior, emphasizing its role in enhancing perceived value, satisfaction, loyalty, and purchase intention in the Online-to-Offline (O2O) takeout food industry.Meanwhile, Ram and Sun (2020) highlighted the advantages of
I N P R E S S
O2O e-commerce, including cost reduction, improved customer management, expanded sales opportunities, and data-driven decision-making.Finally, Tilaar et al. (2023) focused on variables like storytelling, product innovation, value co-creation, and farmer empowerment, revealing their significant effects on customer purchase intention and the mediating role of value co-creation in brand communities on the platform.These studies collectively underscore the importance of trust, green packaging, O2O strategies, and customer-centric variables in contemporary business contexts.Previous research highlights that e-WOM significantly affects purchase decisions, emphasizing the importance of consumer product knowledge.Then, customer engagement positively impacts satisfaction, brand trust, and loyalty, with satisfaction building trust and influencing loyalty.Additionally, e-service quality and trust indicators reveal that customer trust, perceived value, and brand positively influence loyalty, while switching costs and perceived risks have negative effects (Tjhin & Nurul Aini, 2019;Tuti & Sulistia, 2022;Wilis & Nurwulandari, 2020).

Customer engagement is crucial for companies because it will build strong relationships between consumers and companies.Then, the impact affects purchasing decisions.According to Sashi (2019), attachment between sellers and buyers can be formed through seven stages: connection, interaction, satisfaction, retention, commitment, advocacy, and engagement.Connection means building connections in customer engagement relationships.Connection provides a bond between consumers and sellers that can foster a sense of mutual trust and openness.Then, interaction shows that customers can interact with sellers.Next, satisfaction occurs if the interaction between consumers and sellers goes well.In retention, companies retain consumers by establishing good relationships so that consumers recommend products to other people and relatives, and they can buy again.Commitment is related to customer loyalty, reciprocity, emotionality, and trust between sellers and buyers.Then, advocacy refers to disseminating product information by providing services in the form of discounts and free purchases.Lastly, engagement is to create a response from customers, which leads to consumer loyalty to a brand.

Customer satisfaction measures how content and pleased customers are with their experiences, interactions, or purchases from a business.It reflects the extent to which a company meets or exceeds the expectations of its customers, leading to positive feelings and a greater likelihood of repeat business and loyalty.High customer satisfaction is vital for fostering customer loyalty and ultimately driving business success.Based on Mandlik (2023), there is a relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty in the hospitality industry.The findings underscore the crucial role played by factors like positive experiences and loyalty programs in shaping customers' hotel preferences.It highlights the importance of catering to customers' preferences and offering enticing amenities as strategies to boost customer retention and drive overall profitability within the sector.

Referring to the problem of using Instagram as a marketing medium, research on customer engagement relationships through social media Instagram has been carried out.Customer engagement has a significant and positive effect on purchase intention, which means that the greater the customer engagement, the greater the purchase intention (Qorib et al., 2021;Sashi, 2012;Utami & Saputri, 2020).Social media marketing affects brand loyalty through customer engagement (Utami & Saputri, 2020).Instagram is considered an effective social media for disseminating information as well as attracting customers (Sholihah, 2018;Kusuma & Sugandi, 2018).

By comprehending the intricate relationship between customer engagement and purchase intention, the research seeks to provide valuable insights for businesses to harness Instagram as a powerful marketing tool.In anticipation of the research outcomes, the research also aims to elucidate the expected results and benefits.It strives to explore how the relationship between customer engagement and purchase intention plays out in the realm of online marketing through Instagram, particularly with regard to Bandeng Isi MRB products.The research expects to shed light on the significance of interactions between business owners and social media users in shaping customer purchase intentions.

Furthermore, the research aims to elevate the effectiveness of online marketing by identifying strategies that maximize customer engagement through Instagram.The envisaged findings aim to contribute to the evolution of more potent marketing approaches.These approaches empower business owners to optimize Instagram's features and create compelling and relevant content that can capture customers' attention.In addition, the research seeks to pinpoint critical factors that underpin the development of a robust customer engagement relationship.These include effective content types, communication strategies, and techniques to bolster customer engagement.By scrutinizing the data derived from the Instagram account followers @bandengisimrb, the research aspires to gain profound insights into the preferences and characteristics of the target market interested in Bandeng Isi MRB products.This knowledge will lays a solid foundation for devising targeted and effective marketing strategies.Ultimately, the research aims to contribute current knowledge to the existing literature by harmonizing the concepts of customer engagement relationships, Instagram as a social media platform, and customer purchase intention.The anticipation is that the research findings will offer valuable insights and recommendations to enhance online marketing strategies, particularly in the culinary industry, with a specific focus on promoting Bandeng Isi MRB products through Instagram.

## METHODS

The research applies a quantitative approach.An associative approach is used in the survey method, namely by using an online closed questionnaire instrument to collect data from respondents.A closed questionnaire provides alternative answers to the statements or questions so that respondents do not have the freedom to answer questions or statements beyond the alternative answers provided in the questionnaire.The dimensions consist of five indicators ranging from strongly agree, agree, neutral, and disagree to strongly disagree.These indicators are used to measure respondents' answers.The target population consists of 763 customers of Bandeng Isi MRB who follow the Instagram account of @bandengisimrb.The Slovin Formula determines that 161 individuals are required to achieve an adequate sample size.

The use of statistics includes validity, reliability, and multiple linear analysis to determine the effect of various independent variables on one variable.The validity test measures whether a questionnaire is legal or valid.A questionnaire can be said to be valid if the questions in the questionnaire can reveal something that the questionnaire will measure (Ghozali, 2018).Reliability is when a questionnaire is reliable if a person's answers are consistent or stable over time.Meanwhile, multiple linear analysis is used to analyze the impact of various independent variables on one dependent variable (Ferdinand, 2006).The formula for multiple linear analysis includes purchase intention (Y), connection (X1), interaction (X2), satisfaction (X3), retention (X4), commitment (X5), advocacy (X6), and involvement (X7).

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The research results are divided into two sections.First, it is the respondents' profile.Second, it shows the results of calculations with SPSS.Based on Table 2, the age of the respondents consists of 25−34 years (48,4%), 35−44 years (14,9%), 45−54 years (31,1%), and > 55 years (5,6%).Respondents' domiciles include 58,4% in Bandung City, 14,9% in Bandung Regency, 5,6% in DKI Jakarta, and 21,1% in other cities.It can be seen that most of the respondents come from Bandung City.Next, respondents' occupations comprise 11,2% as civil servants, 19,9% as private employees, 14,3% as entrepreneurs, 38,5% as housewives, and 16,1% as others.Therefore, most of the respondents are housewives.The respondents' income distribution can be grouped into several categories.Respondents with income less than Rp3.000.000,00 have 46,6% of the total respondents.The result is followed by income between Rp4.000.000-Rp5.000.000 with 9,3% and Rp5.000.000-Rp6.000.000 with 11.8%.Therefore, most respondents have an income of less than Rp 3.000.000from the total respondents.
I N P R E S S
Validity testing measures the validity or invalidity of a questionnaire statement distributed to respondents.The questionnaire can be valid if the questionnaire statement reveals something that will be measured by the questionnaire (Ferdinand, 2006).Validity measurement in the research uses SPSS ver.20.00.Based on Table 3, according to Hair et al. (2010), the calculated r-value for each question item is greater than the r-table.Hence, all variables are valid and worthy of being used as a research tool.

Next, the calculation of the reliability of the questions uses the SPSS 20.00 software tool.The research also measures the reliability of each variable using the Cronbach's alpha test.According to Ghozali (2018), a variable can be said to be reliable if it has a bigger Cronbach's alpha value than 0,60.Based on Table 4, the results of the reliability show that Cronbach's alpha values for each variable are more than 0,60.Therefore, all the variables used are reliable.Next, the effect of connection (X1), interaction (X2), satisfaction (X3), retention (X4), commitment (X5), advocacy (X6), and engagement (X7) on purchase intention (Y) is tested using multiple linear regression.Multiple linear analysis is a linear relationship between two or more independent variables and the dependent variable.It is said to be a multiple linear analysis because the independent variables studied are more than one.The analysis is carried out to see whether these variables influence the variables studied (Sugiyono, 2017).Based on Table 5, it has a value of 0,670, b1 value of 0,243, b2 value of 0,278, b3 value of 0,178, b4 value of 0,290, b5 value of 0,554, b6 value of 0,152, and b7 value of 0,163.

The regression coefficient value on the independent variables illustrates that if the independent variable increases by one, it is estimated that the other independent variables will be constant or the same as the sign of the regression coefficient of the independent variable.When all factors like connection (X1), interaction (X2), satisfaction (X3), retention (X4), commitment (X5), advocacy (X6), and engagement (X7) have no influence, the purchase intention (Y) remains at a constant value of 0,670.If the regression coefficient for the connection (X1) is observed, it indicates a positive relationship of 0,243.It means that a one-unit increase in connection leads to a corresponding increase in purchase intention (Y) by 0,243.The regression coefficient for the interaction (X2) demonstrates a positive association of 0,278.Thus, when interaction increases, a rise in purchase intention (Y) can be expected.Similarly, the regression coefficients for satisfaction (X3), retention variable (X4), commitment (X5), advocacy (X6), and engagement (X7) exhibit a positive correlation of 0,178, 0,290, 0,554, 0,152, and 0,163, respectively.Consequently, as these factor levels increase, there is an expected increase in purchase intention (Y).

A simultaneous test or F-test is used to determine the effect of all independent variables (connection (X1), interaction (X2), satisfaction (X3), retention (X4), commitment (X5), advocacy (X6), engagement (X7)) on purchase intention (Y) by looking at its significance value.It is significant if the significance value is less than 0,05.It also compares the calculated F-value with the F-table.It is significant if the calculated F is greater than the F-table .The following are the criteria or basis for simultaneous decisionmaking.If the probability is bigger than 0,05, H0 is accepted.Meanwhile, if the probability is smaller than 0,05, H0 is rejected (Table 6).
I N P R E S S
The test uses the help of the IBM SPSS Statistics 20 program.Based on Table 5, the significance value is 0,000, which is less than 0,05, and the calculated F-value is 120,970.It is greater than the F-table, which is 2,16.It shows that H0 is rejected, meaning that connection (X1), interaction (X2), satisfaction (X3), retention (X4), commitment (X5), advocacy (X6), and engagement (X7) simultaneously (together) have an effective positive and significant purchase intention (Y).Thus, it can form a multiple linear regression equation with Y= 0,670 + 0,243 X1 + 0,278X2 + 0,178X3 + 0,290X4 + 0,554X5 + 0,152X6 + 0,163X7.

Connection is how to maintain the relationship that has been fostered.Connection on Instagram will significantly affect the customers' purchase intention as a tool to find the product (Brian in Ratnasari, 2017).Referring to the results of SPSS calculations, connection affects purchase intention.Research on Bandeng Isi MRB shows that connection has a large contribution to purchase intention.This result is in line with Zarella in Ratnasari (2017) that a connection is a sustainable relationship between the sender and recipient of the message.The result also aligns with Adenia (2019).It shows that connections made through Instagram are very good in terms of awareness and interest.The connections can maintain good relationships so customers feel closer to the company.Figure 1 shows the connection dimension that influences purchase intention.

The SPSS calculation results show that interaction significantly influences purchase intention.From the significance level, interaction has an important role in increasing customer purchase intention in Bandeng Isi MRB.The exchange of information between customers and companies is also called interaction.According to Haliyani (2019), in terms of providing added value to companies, the stages are carried out using social media to foster two-way communication, which allows customers to interact further online.

The research concludes that interaction has a significant effect on purchase intention.The results are in line with Haliyani (2019) and Hati and Daningsih (2022) that interaction affects purchase intention.

Customers easily interact so that information about a company's products can reach a wider audience.Then, it can create interest in buying a product.Figure 2 shows the interaction dimension that influences purchase intention.

Based on the results of the SPSS calculation, satisfaction significantly influences purchase intention.The significance level shows that satisfaction has an important role in increasing customer purchase intention in Bandeng Isi MRB.Satisfaction is the feeling and mindset of customers after purchasing goods or services from a company.According to Saidani and Arifin (2012), there are three dimensions in measuring customer satisfaction universally.First, it is the attributes related to the product, such as determining value generated by price, product capability to determine satisfaction, and benefits from the product.Second, there are attributes related to service, such as promised guarantee, process of fulfilling the service or delivery, and process of solving the problem given.Third, the attributes are related to purchase, namely the ease of obtaining information, the courtesy of employees, and the influence of the company's reputation.The result is in accordance with research by Saidani and Arifin (2012) that satisfaction has a positive relationship with purchase intention.

The satisfaction in the customer engagement relationship correlates with respondents' most selected job descriptions, namely housewives, as much as 38,5%.It suggests that housewives as controllers of the family's food needs, are satisfied with Bandeng Isi MRB's products.It is in line with the target market for Bandeng Isi MRB, who are housewives.Figure 3 shows the dimensions of satisfaction that influence purchase intention.

Based on the SPSS calculation results, it shows that retention has a significant influence on purchase intention.The level of significance shows that retention has an important role in increasing customer purchase intention in Bandeng Isi MRB.According to Yustiani et al. (2022), customer retention is a form of mental attraction between customers and a company, which is characterized by repeated and long-term purchases.Bandeng Isi MRB provides a pleasant experience for its customers in terms of clear information, ease of interaction, and service to customers.It is related to customer loyalty to Bandeng Isi MRB products in the form of repeat purchases, recommendations, and product priorities.The research result follows Wardani (2021), showing that electronic customer relationship management has a significant positive relationship with customer retention.This statement is proven by customers who repurchase products and do not switch to other brands.Figure 4 shows the retention dimensions that influence purchase intention.

Bandeng Isi MRB provides a pleasant experience for consumers regarding clear information, ease of interaction, and service to consumers.These factors are related to consumer loyalty toward the products in the form of repeat purchases, recommendations, and product priorities.The research result is in line with Wardani (2021), showing that electronic customer relationship management has a significant positive relationship with customer retention.This statement is proven by consumers who repurchase products and do not switch to other brands.Figure 5 shows commitment dimensions that influence purchase intention.

Based on the SPSS calculation results, advocacy has a positive effect or is directly proportional to purchase intention.It means that the better the advocacy is, the higher the customer's interest in buying Bandeng Isi MRB will be.The level of significance indicates that advocacy has an important role in increasing purchase intention in Bandeng Isi MRB.

The result is in line with research conducted by Miranda (2020) and Sugianto (2020) that advocacy has an effect on purchase intention.The efforts to retain customers using social media communications also increase advocacy (Sashi et al., 2019).Figure 6 shows advocacy dimensions that influence purchase intention.

Based on the results of the SPSS calculation, engagement has a positive or directly proportional effect on purchase intention.The level of significance implies that engagement has an important role in increasing purchase intention in Bandeng Isi MRB.The result follows research by Putri and Zuhra (2023) that customer engagement has a significant effect on purchase intention.It is because customer engagement has interaction as well as communication about products and services to increase customer involvement.Then, it leads to purchase intention.Figure 7 shows the dimensions of engagement that influence purchase intention.


## CONCLUSIONS

A key element in the research is the role of services and features in cultivating customer satisfaction.These factors have the potential to enhance consumer engagement with businesses.Bandeng Isi MRB has succeeded in providing a delightful experience to its consumers by offering transparent information, facilitating easy interactions, and delivering exceptional customer service.This commitment to customer satisfaction fosters loyalty, leading to repeat purchases, word-of-mouth recommendations, and a higher priority placed on Bandeng Isi MRB products.Consumers' positive impression of a company is instrumental in garnering their commitment.It is evident in their willingness to recommend products to others.By ensuring these positive interactions and relationships, businesses can offer high-quality products and bolster customer engagement, ultimately influencing purchasing decisions.The analysis underscores the profound impact of customer engagement on consumer buying interests, making it a crucial aspect of modern business strategies.

Based on the research results, there are several suggestions for the management of Bandeng Isi MRB.Specifically, regarding the advocacy for customer evaluation, it is clear that the lack of discounted prices on nationally celebrated holidays is a concern.Therefore, it is advisable for the company to consider participating in offering price discounts or purchase packages on holidays or customer shopping days that coincide with twin dates.Additionally, in terms of purchase intention, customers lack interest in finding out more about Bandeng Isi MRB on Instagram @ bandengisimrb.It is unfortunate since the company markets its products online.Hence, it is recommended to attract customers to open an @bandengisimrb account before making a purchase.For example, customers can earn points by following, liking, and sharing posts on @bandengisimrb.Then, these points can be exchanged for discount coupons or the opportunity to receive Bandeng Isi MRB products for free.

While conducting the research, the researcher acknowledges several limitations.These limitations encompass the limited number of samples that meet the requirements, as well as the small number of variables.In turn, it restricts the scope of research findings.Consequently, future research can enhance its approach by employing purchasing interest measurements with indicators linked to various dependent variables, potentially yielding a broader range of findings.

In future research, it is recommended to explore further and expand connection, interaction, satisfaction, retention, commitment, advocacy, and engagement to purchase intention.These investigations will enrich references for tertiary institutions.Future research can also apply longitudinal research to track changes over time to understand the long-term effects of these variables on customer behavior.Additionally, cross-cultural analysis is important to determine the generalizability of the findings across different cultural contexts.Then, investigating mediating and moderating factors can enhance the understanding of underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions.Exploring different product categories can also provide insights into specific factors driving purchase intention.Given the online marketing of Bandeng Isi MRB, studying the variables in the online environment is crucial.Hence, comparative research can shed light on the competitive landscape, and replication research can validate and strengthen the research findings.Addressing these areas will deepen understanding and provide practical recommendations for marketers.
