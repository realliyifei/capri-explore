## (s4) Results
### Question: What are the results of applying vom Brocke et al.'s framework to persuasive NLG research?

#Reference=1

(p4.0) The following paragraph shows the results of previous research (literature analysis and synthesis) and therefore is the next step (4) of the vom Brocke et al. (2009) literature review framework. Here, we focus on the four identified categories of persuasive natural language generation that underlie the business framework introduced in step (2) conceptualization. We ordered the identified categories alphabetically, hence, we do not imply a differentiation in degrees of persuasiveness. Additionally, we provide relevant tools and datasets required for implementation of a persuasive NLG.
## (s7) Synopsis Example Source
### Question: What is the role of analogy and causal cohesion in framing issues?

#Reference=2

(p7.0) Analogy Reframes issues through the usage of analogy or metaphor.

(p7.1) In the bible Moses saved all animals. Why don't you save those people? Walton et al. 2008, Olguin et al. 2017 Causal Cohesion

(p7.2) Related to causal relationships of actions and events that help to form relations between sentence clauses.

(p7.3) The ratio of causal verbs (e.g., break) to particles (e.g., because, due to).

### Question: How do connectives and consistency contribute to cohesion and persuasion in text?

#Reference=2

(p8.0) Connectives Create explicit between clauses and sentences, and thus create cohesion between ideas.

(p8.1) E.g., 'moreover' or 'on the other hand'. Longo 1994, Graesser et al. 2011 Consistency When references to previous commitments are made in order to persuade. As I did this, you'll do that.
## (s9) Cialdini & Goldstein 2002
### Question: What are strategies for establishing trade-off ranges in negotiations?

#Reference=2

(p9.0) Establishing Ranges Referencing to similar deals to establish the best possible trade-off range.

(p9.1) In the other deal, they agreed to pay only 5k but got a small car. Does that work for you? Williams, 1983, Hyder et al. 2000 Favors/Debts

(p9.2) When persuader implies that persuadee is indebted to him or her, e.g., coming from previous solicited or unsolicited favors. or decrease of trustworthiness (column one, sorted alphabetically). The following columns provide a synopsis (column two), a corresponding example (column three) and the source in which the determinant was identified (column four). 
## (s10) Tools & Datasets
### Question: What tools and datasets are used in NLP for analyzing persuasion techniques?

#Reference=10

(p10.0) In the analyzed academic studies, we found that the authors use different datasets and tools to computationally process data for technical analyses of persuasion in NLP or NLG (e.g., in Guerini et al 2008a/b, Li et al. 2020, Iyer/Sycara 2019. Logically, the implementation of a persuasive NLG AI also depends on a variety of relevant tools and datasets which we identified and consolidated in Table 6. This table classifies our findings in types which are either tool or datasets (column one). We identified six tools and seventeen persuasion or message datasets. A software tool that is used in the context of persuasion and NLP, and datasets were chosen if they were used in the context of persuasion, textual exchange/debate and NLP. We further added a synopsis (column three) explaining every tool and Authority Appealing or making reference to higher authority or experts to persuade.

(p10.1) We called your mom Mariam and she says please put the gun down and come outside. Cialdini & Goldstein 2002, Catellani et al. 2020 Seeking Comprehension

(p10.2) Instead of prioritizing own arguments, it is wise to focus on understanding the persuadee.

(p10.3) What do you mean by that ? Fisher Uri 1981, Kouzehgar et al. 2015 Construal Learning involves the generalization and abstraction from one's repeated experiences which is a high-construal mental process.

(p10.4) A short-term investor as opposed to long-term investor may rely more on a financial artificial intelligence. Kim & Duhachek 2020, Abdallah et al. 2009 Emotionality The elicitation of positive or negative emotions to impose more weight on words.

(p10.5) Inclusion of words or expressions such as "amazing" or "excellent". Rocklage et al. 2018 Empathy This is a very good positive book that will make you very happy. Guerini et al. 2008b, Zarouali et al. 2020 dataset, providing a link (column four, if applicable) and the respective citation of the tool or dataset (column five). The tools and datasets are sorted alphabetically.
