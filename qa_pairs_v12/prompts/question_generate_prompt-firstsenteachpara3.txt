You are building a scientific question-answering dataset.
You will be given a content extracted from a paper.
You should construct the best question that would be answered by the information that summarizes by (some of) the content. 

# The requirements of the question:
1. Unambiguous: clearly framed to avoid follow-up questions for clarification.
2. Expert-level and natural: phrased as if asked by a domain expert conducting research
3. Answerable: should be answered by the information in the content 
4. Not overly broad: should not be so vague that it's unclear where to start
5. Standalone and not overly tailored: understandable by any expert without needing specific context or jargon anchored specifically in the given contents
6. Expect a long-form, comprehensive answer: not simply extractive or yes-no questions
7. Less than 20 words

# Some good questions that satisfy the requirements:
What are the specific functions or general strengths of different layers in BERT?
In recent studies of natural language generation systems, what measures of social bias have been used recently?
How do multilingual NLP models handle joint vocabularies during pretraining?
What are some recent important BERT variants that have been proposed and what distinguishes them?
When finetuning a large language model, what are some recent methods for preventing catastrophic forgetting?
How does BERT encode world knowledge and how do people use it in downstream application?
What are the differences between publicly available linguistic typology databases?
Can you summarize the approaches used to incorporate typological information in downstream NLP tasks?
Why do conversation models often produce responses that are inconsistent with previous turns?

Only return the question ifself, without anything else.

Paper Title: A Primer in BERTology: What we know about how BERT works
Section Title: BERT layers
Extracted first sentences of each paragraph from the section that contain the answer to the question: The first layer of BERT receives as input a combina- tion of token, segment, and positional embeddings.

It stands to reason that the lower layers have the most information about linear word order.

There is a wide consensus in studies with different tasks, datasets and methodologies that syntactic information is most prominent in the middle layers of BERT.

There is conflicting evidence about syntactic chunks.

The final layers of BERT are the most task- specific.

Tenney et al. (2019a) suggest that while syntactic information appears early in the model and can be localized, semantics is spread across the entire model, which explains why certain non-trivial ex- amples get solved incorrectly at first but correctly at the later layers.

Note that Tenney et al. (2019a)’s experiments concern sentence-level semantic relations; Cui et al. (2020) report that the encoding of ConceptNet se- mantic relations is the worst in the early layers and increases towards the top.

Paper Title: A Survey on Contextual Embeddings
Section Title: Cross-lingual Polyglot Pre-training for Contextual Embeddings
Extracted first sentences of each paragraph from the section that contain the answer to the question: Cross-lingual polyglot pre-training aims to learn joint multi-lingual representations, enabling knowledge transfer from data-rich languages like English to data-scarce languages like Romanian. Based on whether joint training and a shared vocabulary are used, we divide previous work into three categories.

Joint training & shared vocabulary. Artetxe and Schwenk (2019) use a BiLSTM encoder- decoder framework with a shared BPE vocabulary for 93 languages.

Rosita (Mulcaire et al., 2019) pre-trains a lan- guage model using text from different languages, showing the benefits of polyglot learning on low- resource languages.

Recently, the authors of BERT developed a multi-lingual BERT2 which is pre-trained using the Wikipedia dump with more than 100 languages.

XLM (Lample and Conneau, 2019) uses three pre-training methods for learning cross-lingual language models: (1) Causal language mod- elling, where the model is trained to predict p(ti|t1, t2, ..., ti−1),

Joint training & separate vocabularies. Wu et al. (2019) study the emergence of cross-lingual structures in pre-trained multi-lingual language models.

Separate training & separate vocabularies. Artetxe et al. (2019) use a four-step method for obtaining multi-lingual embeddings.

Paper Title: Modeling Language Variation and Universals: A Survey on Typological Linguistics for Natural Language Processing
Section Title: Uses of Typological Information in NLP Models
Extracted first sentences of each paragraph from the section that contain the answer to the question: The typological features developed as discussed in § 4 are of significant importance for NLP algorithms. 

An interesting example of a rule-based system in our context is the Grammar Matrix kit, presented by Bender (2016), where rule-based grammars can be generated from typological features. 

The most common usage of typological features in NLP is in feature engineering and constraint design for machine learning algorithms. 

5.2.1 Selective sharing. This framework was introduced by Naseem, Barzilay, and Globerson (2012) and was subsequently adopted by Täckström, McDonald, and Nivre (2013) and Zhang and Barzilay (2015).

Selective sharing was originally implemented in a generative framework, factor- izing the recursive generation of dependency tree fragments into two steps (Naseem, Barzilay, and Globerson 2012).

In Equation (1), the first step is expressed as two factors: the estimation of the number n of modifiers, parametrized by θ1, and the actual selection of modifiers, parametrized by θ2, with the softmax function σ converting the n values into probabilities.

Täckström, McDonald, and Nivre (2013) proposed a discriminative version of the model, in order to amend the alleged limitations of the original generative variant.

This approach was further extended to tensor-based models by Zhang and Barzilay (2015), in order to avoid the shortcomings of manual feature selection.

The different approaches to selective sharing presented here explicitly deal with cases where the typological features do not match any of the source languages, which may lead learning astray.
Question: Can you summarize the approaches used to incorporate typological information in downstream NLP tasks?
