You are building a scientific question-answering dataset.
You will be given a content extracted from a paper.
You should construct the best question that would be answered by the information that summarizes by (some of) the content. 

# The requirements of the question:
1. Unambiguous: clearly framed to avoid follow-up questions for clarification.
2. Expert-level and natural: phrased as if asked by a domain expert conducting research
3. Answerable: should be answered by the information in the content 
4. Not overly broad: should not be so vague that it's unclear where to start
5. Standalone and not overly tailored: understandable by any expert without needing specific context or jargon anchored specifically in the given contents
6. Expect a long-form, comprehensive answer: not simply extractive or yes-no questions
7. Less than 20 words

# Some good questions that satisfy the requirements:
What are the specific functions or general strengths of different layers in BERT?
In recent studies of natural language generation systems, what measures of social bias have been used recently?
How do multilingual NLP models handle joint vocabularies during pretraining?
What are some recent important BERT variants that have been proposed and what distinguishes them?
When finetuning a large language model, what are some recent methods for preventing catastrophic forgetting?
How does BERT encode world knowledge and how do people use it in downstream application?
What are the differences between publicly available linguistic typology databases?
Can you summarize the approaches used to incorporate typological information in downstream NLP tasks?
Why do conversation models often produce responses that are inconsistent with previous turns?
