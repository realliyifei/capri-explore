Summary of 2007 test beam 
Summary of 2007 test beam 

• The 2007 test beam has been a huge success ! 

All active elements of calorimeters completed 
Movable mechanics commissioned 

• The test beam programme has been completely 
fulfilled, thanks to the hard work of everyone involved 
and to the extra weeks given to us by CERN 
• The participation in the test beam has been 
incredible and full of enthusiasm from everyone in the 
collaboration 
• We have ~14 TB of data available on the grid ready 
to be analyzed 
• Successful tests of SciWECAL and DHCAL prototypes 
also performed
