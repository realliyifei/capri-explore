## (s15) MRI diagnosis in ID
(p15.0) MRI has good discrimination of soft tissue and no ionizing radiation damage to the human body, so it is good at imaging tumors in the brain, bladder, rectum, reproductive system, and other parts.

(p15.1) In segmentation, we have to introduce the work written by Drozdzal et al. [66], which combines Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) with Fully Convolutional Residual Networks (FC-ResNets [93]) to segment medical images, such as electron microscopy (EM) image, CT of the liver, and MRI of the prostate. The results reveal that this model is working well in both 2D and 3D medical images, which means that it could achieve accurate segmentations on a variety of image modalities and different anatomical regions. Details are shown in Figure 10, which uses the FCN to obtain pre-normalized images, and then iteratively refined employing the FC-ResNet to generate a segmentation prediction.
