## (s3) DAG-based Blockchain
(p3.0) The blockchain architecture of a DAG-based blockchain system is based on Tangle [77]. Within Tangle, a DAG-based blockchain organizes all transactions in a DAG rather than packing transactions into blocks like in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Due to the non-block based structure, DAG-based blockchains are not limited by block generation. Therefore, DAG-based blockchains have great potential to provide higher throughput and lower latency than block-based blockchains.

(p3.1) For the data structure, in Tangle [23,78], each transaction is represented by a node. All the transactions are issued by clients through a selective proof-of-work (PoW) process. Leaf nodes (i.e., transactions that have not been approved by latter transactions) are called tips. For a transaction to be added, the system must select and approve two tips. During the tip selection and approval process, a random walking algorithm is used to choose tips for approval, and a transaction validation algorithm is performed to verify the transactions along the validation path to avoid double-spending.
