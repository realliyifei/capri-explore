## (s2) A. Aphasia
(p2.0) Aphasia is a disorder that affects the comprehension and formulation of language and is caused by damage to the areas of the brain involved in language [49]. People with aphasia have difficulties with understanding, speaking, reading or writing, but their intelligence is normally unaffected. For instance, aphasic patients struggle in retrieving the words they want to say, a condition known as anomia. The opposite mental process, i.e., the transformation of messages heard or read into an internal message, is also affected in aphasia. Aphasia affects not only spoken but also written communication (reading/writing) and visual language (e.g., sign languages) [49].
