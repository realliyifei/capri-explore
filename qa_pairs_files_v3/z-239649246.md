## (s12) Limitations
(p12.0) The purpose of this study was to qualitatively review the literature; therefore, no quantitative comparisons can be drawn from this study. We noted the limited information or absence of reporting by trial authors on patient characteristics and outcomes of interest, particularly when the primary study involved a clinical trial registry entry or conference abstract with minimal information. For example, mRECIST criteria are considered to be more sensitive than RECIST criteria in assessing tumor response and predicting survival [104]; however, as noted in the Results, mRECIST criteria were used less frequently than RECIST and would therefore be more difficult to assess for similarity in a quantitative analysis. Similarly, the reporting of TEAEs and TRAEs differed for specific safety events. We also did not assess the comparability of patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life. However, we found that very few trials reported quality of life; therefore a robust assessment of similarity would not be possible.

(p12.1) There are several treatments being assessed as monotherapies or in novel combinations in patients with HCC [105,106]. This review is inherently limited by the rapidly evolving trial landscape in this field. However, our review demonstrates the need for treatments with improved efficacy and safety profiles, as we found that the typical overall survival for patients using recommended treatments in the RCT settings was approximately 12 months, and approximately one in seven patients discontinued trial participation (based on mOS median values of 13.4 months and 10.2 months in 1L and 2L settings, respectively, and median discontinuation due to TEAEs of 13%).
