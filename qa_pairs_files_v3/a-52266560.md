## (s23) New versions of the method of characteristics
(p23.0) In the presently used formulations of the method of characteristics discussed in Sect.6, it was assumed that the conductance ratio α is a known input parameter.However, from a technical point of view it is equally possible to use either the Hall or Pedersen conductance as an input parameter, instead of α.If P is known, we can start with relation

(p23.1) where the right side is known from the input data.This can be written out as

(p23.2) which is completely analogous to Eq. ( 43).This thus far overlooked approach may have some applications, as Senior et al. (2008) showed that P can be estimated quite accurately from all-sky camera images taken at 557.7 nm.Another extension of the present analysis methods was mentioned in Sect. 4. If we obtain the total current J from FAC and ground magnetic field, and further estimate α (e.g. from the current itself, see Juusola et al., 2007), we can formulate a new "J -based" method of characteristics.The central equation is obtained from the curl of inverted Ohm's law,

(p23.3) This can be written as

(p23.4) where R H = H /( 2 P + 2 H ). Also this equation has the same form as Eq. ( 43) and can be solved in a similar way for R H .The curl of E may either be approximated as zero, or calculated from the known current system.

(p23.5) However, these variants of the method of characteristics have not yet been thoroughly tested nor applied with real data.
