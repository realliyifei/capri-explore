## (s18) CHALLENGES
(p18.0) Despite the great potential of AI technology in agrifood systems, challenges still exist. In this context, we summarize five challenges related to agricultural characteristics, external factors, data acquisition and processing, model design and maintenance, and ethical risks.

(p18.1) Agricultural characteristics Agricultural production has unique characteristics such as regionality and seasonality. These characteristics pose new challenges for the application of AI in agriculture. For example, AI models should consider the wide range of agrifood products produced in different regions, while the long growth cycle of crops can limit the real-time performance of technologies. Therefore, it is essential to consider the characteristics of agricultural activities when designing AI solutions.

(p18.2) External factors Agricultural activities are affected by multiple natural conditions, such as water resources, soil nutrients, terrains, and climates. Climate factors, including light and precipitation, are considered major impact factors on agrifood industries. However, developing AI models that are robust across different climates, especially in regions with extreme or unpredictable weather, can be challenging. Furthermore, some adverse conditions, such as weak network infrastructure in rural areas of developing countries, can limit the integration of AI, IoT, and agriculture.

(p18.3) Data acquisition and processing Agricultural practices are long and complex processes, and relying solely on a single data resource may not lead to effective judgments and expected outcomes. In the agrifood system, data is often heterogeneous as it is obtained from various sources and stored in multiple databases with diverse formats, following a series of preprocessing procedures. Attaining high efficiency in the acquisition, integration, and collaboration of multimodal data has emerged as a major challenge in the implementation of agricultural AI.

(p18.4) Model design and maintenance Designing algorithms with a large amount of data for complex agrifood systems is typically a time-consuming process. Additionally, the resulting AI models can be sophisticated and have high computational complexity, making deployment difficult for farmers. Furthermore, maintaining and updating these models is crucial to meet continuous new demands throughout the long growth cycle. This poses a new challenge for AI service providers.

(p18.5) Ethical risks In addition to accuracy, efficiency, and practicality, it is important to consider the ethical risks associated with adopting AI models. AI solutions are frequently employed in critical decision-making scenarios that involve access to private data. Improper use of such data can result in various legal issues, such as privacy breaches and malicious attacks. Lack of transparency can undermine the trust of farmers and consumers, leading to their reluctance to adopt AI solutions and hindering the development of AI technologies. Therefore, constructing trustworthy AI systems is an urgent and significant issue that demands immediate attention and resolution. Fig. 12. AI models enable reading agrifood product information.
