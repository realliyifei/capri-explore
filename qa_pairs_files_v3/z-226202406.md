## (s2) Results and Discussion
(p2.0) Characteristics of the Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

(p2.1) When analyzing the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (the main antigenic component that is responsible for inducing host immune responses), it was found to be extremely similar to that of SARS. However, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) for the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, found on the surface of human cells, is approximately 20 times higher than that of the SARS' S protein [6,7].

(p2.2) The SARS-CoV-2 S protein component is a trimeric glycoprotein that consists of two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 is responsible for receptor binding, whilst the S2 subunit is responsible for membrane fusion. Additionally, the S1 subunit, which has two independent domains, the N-and C-terminals, shows much higher variability than S2 [8].
