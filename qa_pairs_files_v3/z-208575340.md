## (s8) Approaches employed in the discovery of new antimalarial drugs 3.1 Computational approach
(p8.0) Drug design and discovery pipeline comprises all the drug development stages, from identifying a target to clinical trials for testing the drug on human subjects.Hence, drug discovery is typically considered a time-consuming and costly process.However, computer aided drug design (CADD), a computational technology aimed at assisting the antimalarial drug discovery process, has become indispensable in recent years.It makes use of the structural knowledge of either the target (structure-based) or known ligands with bioactivity (ligand-based) to facilitate the identification of likely candidate drugs (Macalino et al., 2015).

(p8.1) A study benefiting from this approach was performed by Granchi et al. (2015) with the aim of finding new human lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5) inhibitors.As a part of this investigation, an automated docking-based virtual screening platform was developed by considering different protein conformations and the consensus docking strategy.The authors discovered that two of the ten of the selected compounds efficiently inhibit the enzyme activity via enzymatic assays (Granchi et al., 2015).Given that it avoids carrying out enzymatic assays of thousands of compounds, CADD is highly cost-and time-efficient, as it helps optimizing the work in the laboratory.Several studies have been performed using both structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligandbased drug design (LBDD) approaches in finding new inhibitors for the enzymes in Plasmodium spp. as the target, as summarized in Table 3. Huthmacher et al. (2010) conducted their study with the goal of elucidating the capability of computational methods to foresee the metabolic activities during different stages of P. falciparum life cycle, which later led to the identification of new drug targets.Their findings suggested that the set of significant enzymes projected by flux balance approach signifies a reliable beginning for further drug development (Huthmacher et al., 2010).
