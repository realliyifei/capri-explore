(p9.0) In addition to the classical mechanisms described above, alterations in other mechanisms may also affect OS in GCs, which in turn may lead to impaired ovarian function. For example, lower antioxidants levels reduced SOD2, which leads to elevated OS, resulting in an imbalance between ROS production and antioxidant capacity in mitochondria, ultimately leading to oxidative mitochondrial damage, reduced mitochondrial function, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis [116].

(p9.1) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, siRNA-like molecules encoded by higher eukaryotic genomes. miRNAs degrade mRNAs or block their translation by base pairing with target gene mRNAs to guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). They play a huge role in cell differentiation, biological development, and disease progression, and they are increasingly attracting the attention of researchers. Further research on the mechanism of miRNA action and using the latest high-throughput technologies, such as miRNA microarrays, to investigate the relationship between miRNAs and diseases will lead to greater understanding of the network of gene expression regulation in higher eukaryotes. This will also enable miRNAs to become new biological markers for disease diagnosis. It may also allow this molecule to become a target for new drugs or to be copied for drug development, providing a new means of treatment for human diseases. miR-196b-5p significantly increases the expression of CYP19A1 and GLUT4 and decreases the levels of radixin and leucine-rich repeat-containing 17 in ovarian GCs, thereby regulating their OS, glucose uptake, and steroidogenic pathways, and then promoting follicle development and maturation [117]. miR-183-96-182, on the other hand, can be affected by NORHA and thus promote apoptosis in porcine GCs [77]. In contrast, MiRNA-146b-5p overexpression alleviated POF in mice by inhibiting the Dab2ip/Ask1/p38-Mapk pathway and Î³H2A.X phosphorylation [63]. Additionally, miR-30a-5p inhibits GC death by targeting Beclin1 [118].
