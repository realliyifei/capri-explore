## (s10) Vaccination
(p10.0) Vaccination is not considered here as a natural factor impacting carry-over but rather an intervention step to help reduce the carry-over experienced in regular circumstances.

(p10.1) Polonelli et al. (2011) [19] presented an interesting solution to the public hazard caused by milk products contaminated with aflatoxins. They reported that a vaccine based on a non-toxic modification of AFB1, anaflatoxin B1 (AnAFB1), conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), together with Freund's adjuvant, could be effective in inducing a long-lasting titer of anti-AFB1 IgG antibodies in cows, which were cross-reactive with toxic aflatoxins including AFB1. Vaccination of lactating cows reduced the secretion of AFM1 into their milk [19].

(p10.2) In an attempt to achieve a more effective formulation, Giovati et al. (2014) [34] further studied the application injected together with various adjuvants. According to their findings, the pre-calving vaccination of heifers was potentially the most effective means of preventing aflatoxin transfer. Carry-over was reduced to 0.77% in vaccinated heifers, resulting in a 74% decrease in AFM1 concentration in milk [34].
