## (s31) Supporting Relatives by Development of Support Plans
(p31.0) The Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool (CSNAT) approach aims to expand the focus of discharge planning on caregivers' support needs, to strengthen the carers' role in end-of-life care and to prevent patients from hospital readmission due to decompensation of home care, which was deemed feasible by carers and health care professionals [41]. In addition, the CSNAT intervention seems to reduce early grief, improve psychological and physical health as well as the perception that the "place of death was the right" in family carers compared to the control group, and to increase the rate of patients dying at home [41]. Thomsen et al. evaluated a four-step process evaluation of systematic risk and needs assessment for caregivers in specialized palliative care. They were able to include 46% of their family caregivers in the intervention. The first steps, an interdisciplinary risk assessment and documentation of a support plan could be performed in 75%, whilst the final step, a separate medical record according to the intervention blueprint, could be completed in 62% of caregivers. The palliative care staff perceived that this intervention was useful and acceptable, but efficacy data are pending [35].
