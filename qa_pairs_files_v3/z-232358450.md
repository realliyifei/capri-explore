## (s9) THE STRUCTURE DESIGN OF POROUS METAL SCAFFOLDS
(p9.0) The ideal scaffold should be a porous structure in space that provides space for cells to adhere, grow and proliferate, and have mechanical properties similar to the bone tissue (Cheng et al., 2014). Pore size and porosity are very important structural parameters, which have a direct impact on mechanical properties and biocompatibility of bone scaffolds. Proper pore size can provide growth space for cells, and proper porosity can ensure transportation of nutrients and metabolites in bone tissue (Cheng et al., 2014). Besides, the shape of the porous scaffold structure is also related to the biocompatibility and mechanical properties. The continuous and smooth porous structure can avoid stress concentration and facilitate the attachment of cells to the scaffold surface.
