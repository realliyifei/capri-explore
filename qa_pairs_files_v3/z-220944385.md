## (s17) Atrial fibrillation
(p17.0) A meta-analysis by Gong M et al. explored the relationship of galectin-3 with risk of atrial fibrillation [28]. They found a significantly higher galectin-3 concentration in patients with atrial fibrillation than those without (MD=-0.268ng/mL) and a significantly higher galectin-3 concentration in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation than those with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (MD=-0.94ng/mL).

(p17.1) Three different study groups performed similar meta-analyses to evaluate the relationship of galectin-3 with recurrence of atrial fibrillation [28][29][30]. Two of them found that patients with recurrence of atrial fibrillation had a significantly higher galectin-3 concentration than those without [28,29], but another did not find such a statistically significant difference in galectin-3 concentration between patients with and without recurrence of atrial fibrillation [30]. By comparison, all of them showed that a higher galectin-3 concentration was significantly related to recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
## (s21) Pregnancy
(p21.0) Three meta-analyses evaluated the diagnostic value of galectins alone or in combination with pulsatility index for preeclampsia (Table 3) [34][35][36].

(p21.1) Two different study groups published similar meta-analyses in 2015 to explore the diagnostic accuracy of galectin-13 alone for preeclampsia [34,35]. Wu P et al. identified nine studies exploring the role of galectin-13, also known as placental protein 13, for diagnosis of preeclampsia [34]. The AUC was 0.882, sensitivity 37%, and specificity 88%. In another meta-analysis by Zhong Y et al., the sensitivity and specificity of galectin-13 were 47% and 89% for early preeclampsia, 60% and 78% for early preeclampsia, 36% and 90% for small for gestational age, and 51% and 88% for preterm delivery, respectively [35]. LGALS2 -C3279T gene polymorphism and ischemic stroke * Studies included heart failure patients and general population.
