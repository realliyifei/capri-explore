## (s11) confidently (mean score 4 .5 on a 5 -
(p11.0) point scale) arrived at a diagnostic result that aligned with the previous in-person examination of children by other specialists.Smith et al. [31] showed a diagnostic agreement between NODA and in-person diagnosis of 88.2%, sensitivity was 84.9%, and specificity was 94.4%.At Florida State University, Dow et al. [32] investigated the psychometric properties of their proposed SORF technique in 228 children aged 18 to 24 months with ASD, CP12496 Consortium Psychiatricum | 2023 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 with developmental delay and with typical development.Specificity and sensitivity were 63% and 73% for social communication and interaction disorders and 54% and 70% for manifestations of stereotypical forms of behavior.The most informative parameters were limited eye contact, looking into an adult's face, pointing gesture, predominance of interest in non-living objects, adherence to certain nonfunctional objects, and actions.Pileggi et al. [33] tested SORF as a screening tool for early detection of ASD risk in 122 one-year-old younger siblings of children with confirmed autism.ASD was confirmed in younger siblings at the age of 24 months.With an optimal Composite threshold of 18, sensitivity was 0.77 and specificity was 0.76.NIDA, Italy's largest network of interdisciplinary services for observational research and early screening of ASD, has developed the TeleNIDA telemedicine tool for children aged 18-30 months.Parents provide 5-minute videos of their child's behavior during free play, organized play with parents, eating, and book activities.The tool also has good psychometric properties compared to the "gold standard"

(p11.1) investigated the possibility of remote detection of ASD risk in 41 infants (mean age 10.51 months) using the Telehealth Evaluation of Development for Infants (TEDI).

(p11.2) of a project comparing the use of TAP and TELE-STAT with in-person assessment presents the results of a survey of 144 children aged 17 to 36 months, showing diagnostic agreement in 92% of cases.Diagnostic discrepancies were more often associated with a lesser severity of autistic symptoms or younger age of the children.A large study by McNally Keehn et al. [41] investigated the relationship between the clinical characteristics of 335 children aged 14 to 78 months and the effectiveness of remote diagnosis of ASD using TAP.For 85% of the examined children, including those with speech underdevelopment, the TMC format was sufficient to detect the symptoms of ASD; the presence of specific stereotypical behavior predicted the diagnosis to a greater extent.

(p11.3) the Child Behavior Checklist to a novel mobile-health screening tool developed by Cognoa.Data for machine learning was collected from several repositories of the ADI-R and ADOS protocols; in an automatic mode and in a short time, the program evaluates the behavioral characteristics of children according to separate questionnaires for parents, CP12496 Consortium Psychiatricum | 2023 | Volume 4 | Issue 3

(p11.4) videoconferencing without the need to travel long distances for in-person psychiatric visits.In the Russian-speaking segment, we found only a description of a pilot comparative ASD diagnosis study within the framework of TMC and in-person consultations, which was conducted at the Moscow State Budgetary Healthcare Institution "Scientific and Practical Center for Mental Health of Children and Adolescents named after G.E. Sukhareva of the Moscow Department of Health" [54].There were 84 patients in the TMC group and 310 patients in the in-person consultations group.All consultations were conducted by one specialist and had a stable clear structure and duration.

(p11.5) consumers of diagnostic services coincides to the maximum extent with the tasks of ASD screening.Online screening CP12496 Consortium Psychiatricum | 2023 | Volume 4 | Issue 3allows one to conduct a primary examination in a much larger group of children aged 16-30 months thanks to the fact that it is easily accessible when placing simple tools with high sensitivity on various web resources; it does not require special training on the part of its users (parents, teachers, or specialists of the primary medical network).Studies conducted in different countries suggest the possibility and expediency of using the telemedicine format instead of the time-consuming and expensive routine offline screening procedure with limited productivity[20][21][22].The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated and scaled up the development of special tools for remote diagnosis of ASD.The analysis of the publications presented in this review convincingly indicates a sufficient equivalence between assessment scales and structured procedures for the remote diagnosis of ASD and in-person examination with a high level of specificity, from 60.0 to 94.4%, sensitivity from 75 to 98.4%, and satisfaction of patients and their legal representatives.Most diagnostic tools are for children over 18 months of age, but tools are also available for the remote diagnosis of ASD in infants 6-12 months of age [34, 35].Synchronous variants of clinical and psychopathological and remote diagnosis of ASD based on standardized tools are as close as possible to the in-person interaction between specialists and consumers of medical care; however, they require coordinated schedules of care recipients and specialists.There was an almost 100% consistency level between the online and offline formats of the socalled "gold standard for autism diagnosis" ADI-R and ADOS [25].Asynchronous models of remote assessment of ASD symptoms use video recordings of the child's behavior in their usual home settings, are free from organizational difficulties in coordinating the schedule of consultations, and provide video recording of the most characteristic manifestations at a convenient time for the required period of time.Typically, recommended video recording scenarios include focusing on the child's spontaneous and directed play both alone and with parents and siblings, eating together, making requests, imitating actions, and problematic behavior.A number of studies have noted some difficulties in the remote assessment of a pointing gesture and eye contact in the videoconferencing mode, which requires additional clarification of the details of the corresponding manifestations by the persons accompanying the child

(p11.6) These authors reviewed publications comparing a remote format for diagnosing autistic disorders in childhood as part of ASD risk screening and clinical diagnosis including the use of standardized rating scales and procedures.We analyzed various structured tools for a qualitative and quantitative assessment of ASD symptoms developed and validated in different countries for use in the TMC format.A large number of studies have confirmed their acceptable equivalence to in-person diagnosis and sufficient applicability in young children, including infants in their first year of life.At the same time, the availability of these tools in Russian pediatric psychiatry practice is limited; one of the reasons is the need to purchase expensive licenses from copyright holders, which increases the relevance of developing domestic analogues.The introduction and widespread use of validated telemedicine diagnostic systems in clinical practice will contribute to the early detection of ASD and increase the timeliness and effectiveness of medical, corrective psychological, pedagogical, and habilitation interventions.The active use of the remote diagnostic format can mitigate the limitations in the availability and timeliness of specialized care for children with ASD, which are among the most difficult problems of modern pediatric psychiatry.In Russia, the "patient-doctor" format of TMC in the case of remote interaction between healthcare professionals and patients and/or their legal representatives has yet to take root, and, therefore, the various organizational, legal, clinical, and methodological aspects of remote care for ASD require further development.One of the relevant issues is the selection of valid diagnostic tools for remote symptom assessment with an evaluation of their agreement with the traditional face-to-face assessment procedures.Article history:Submitted: 07.07.2023Accepted: 31.08.2023Published Online: 15.09.2023
