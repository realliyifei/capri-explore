## (s24) Causal Effect for Uplift. Uplift, in terms of the causal effect of recommendations, refers to the increase in user
(p24.0) interactions purely caused by recommendations. Typical evaluations of recommender systems regard the positive user interactions as a success, such as clicks, purchases, and high rates. However, these interactions may have remained even without recommendations, which can be illustrated by the conclusion of [124] that more than 75% of click-throughs would still occur in the absence of recommendations. Therefore, the industry looks favorably on the uplift as the recommendation metric in expectation of higher reward.

(p24.1) It is a natural application to introduce the causality concepts such as ATE and CATE for uplift modeling since the definition of uplift is a counterfactual problem and consistent with the objective of causal effect estimation [161,173].
