## (s7) Inflammation
(p7.0) Nanoemulsions could also be employed in anti-inflammatory functions. Free radicals are released by enzymes, toxic metabolites of pathogens, and inflammation mediators such as polymorphonuclear lymphocytes, leading to chronic inflammation. These same enzymes and metabolites deprive host cells of their required nutrients for growth. However, the mix of emulsifiers and oils was reportedly significant in phytochemicals absorption and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), i.e., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Yen et al. 2018) and periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease that erodes teeth's supporting structures (Aithal et al. 2018).
