(p20.0) Orthogonal Mapping where , is the ground truth rating andˆ, is predicted rating computing by Θ. The 1 -norm offers enhanced robustness against outliers or anomalous data in comparison to the Euclidean distance (i.e., 2 -norm). By integrating the 1 -norm regularization, the model prioritizes essential features over noise, leading to more refined recommendations. In recent times, researchers continue to innovate regularization strategies to improve the robustness of recommender systems in the presence of natural noise. As an illustration, Chen et al. [23] meld Jacobian regularization [68] with the transformer block in sequential recommender systems. This regularization enables a significant reduction in the model's susceptibility to noisy sequences, consequently delivering more consistent and trustworthy recommendations amidst noise.

(p20.1) While regularization offers a versatile means to enhance noise robustness across diverse recommender systems, its broad scope might dilute its efficacy against specific noise types. While instrumental in countering overfitting and amplifying generalization, regularization does not directly target the genesis of noise. Consequently, it's necessary to couple regularization with other noise-mitigation approaches for superior outcomes.
