## (s8) Conclusion
(p8.0) In this work, we have provided a comprehensive study of the different important variants of SARS-CoV-2 and their corresponding unique mutation points in Spike glycoprotein. This is especially important to understand the effect of the mutations on the vaccines. In this regard, there are 12 important variants of SARS-CoV-2 which are identified; they being Alpha, Beta, Eta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Gamma, Zeta, Theta and lately, Omicron and they have 84 unique mutations in the Spike glycoprotein. These 84 include such mutations like S371L, N440K, G446S, Q493R, N501Y etc. which are   Near furin cleavage site, may affect transmissibility of the virus [2] known to resist antibodies. With the current surge of Omicron variant throughout the world and it being highly resistant to neutralisation by the existing vaccines, booster shots are being recommended worldwide and new phases of partial lockdowns are also coming into effect. In this current scenario, the existing vaccines are getting modified and new vaccines are also being manufactured. We hope that this work provides the readers a comprehensive review of the emerging variants and the characteristics of the corresponding mutation points along with the effects of vaccine and therapeutics on the variants.
