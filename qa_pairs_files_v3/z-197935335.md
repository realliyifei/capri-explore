## (s15) A. Optimization of DL Models in Edge
(p15.0) DL tasks are usually computationally intensive and requires large memory footprints. But in the edge, there are not enough resources to support raw large-scale DL models. Optimizing DL models and quantize their weights can reduce resource costs. In fact, model redundancies are common in DNNs [109], [110] and can be utilized to make model optimization possible. The most important challenge is how to ensure that there is no significant loss in model accuracy after being optimized. In other words, the optimization approach should transform or re-design DL models and make them fit in edge devices, with as little loss of model performance as possible. In this section, optimization methods for different scenarios are discussed: 1) general optimization methods for edge nodes with relatively sufficient resources; 2) fine-grained optimization methods for end devices with tight resource budgets.
