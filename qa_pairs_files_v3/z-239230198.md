## (s9) Feature screening
(p9.0) Massive datasets often involve ultrahigh dimensional data, for which feature screening is critically important (Fan and Lv, 2008). To fix the idea, consider a standard linear regression model as Y i = X i θ * + i , i ∈ S, where X i ∈ R p is the covariate vector, Y i is the corresponding response, θ * ∈ R p is the true parameter, and ε i is the random noise.

(p9.1) To screen for the most promising features, the seminal method of sure independence screening (SIS) has been proposed by Fan and Lv (2008). Specifically, let A * = {1 ≤ j ≤ p : θ * j = 0} be the true sparse model. Let ω j be the Pearson correlation between jth feature and response Y . Then, SIS screens features by a hard threshold procedure asÂ γ = {1 ≤ j ≤ p : |ω j | > γ}, where γ is a prespecified threshold andω j is the whole sample estimator of ω j . Under some specific conditions, Fan and Lv (2008) showed the sure screening property for SIS, that is,

(p9.2) However, the estimatorω j is usually biased for many correlation measures. This
