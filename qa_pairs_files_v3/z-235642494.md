## (s10) Clonorchis sinensis
(p10.0) Clonorchis sinensis, the Chinese liver fluke, is mainly found in East Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, Korea, and Northern Vietnam [108]. Like O. viverrini, the parasite is digenetic, with snails and cyprinid fish as intermediate hosts. It shares a similar mechanism of infection and carcinogenesis as O. viverrini-by causing mechanical damage and chemical irritation to its host.

(p10.1) In addition to mechanical damage, feeding of the frequently propagating parasites at the bile ducts serves as mechanical obstruction, leading to metaplasia of the biliary epithelial cells. These cells will transform into mucin-producing cells that produce excretorysecretory products (ESPs) and mucus in the bile [109]. At the same time, the presence of the parasite at the biliary tree is recognized by host TLR-2 and -4, resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These peptides were originally intended for fluke elimination, however, they now contribute towards disease progression, causing toxicity towards the host, and cholangiocyte damage [110].
