## (s6) Critical appraisal
(p6.0) EF and FP independently appraised the captured systematic reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool, which has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and construct validity. 17In assessing the overall quality of individual studies, more weight was given to the AMSTAR 2 critical domains (ie, 7 out 16 items). 17About the protocol domain, an explicit statement was required that the methods had been established prior to conducting the systematic review and/or that PRISMA guidelines 16 or those for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies 18 had been adhered to, and/or that any deviations from protocol had been reported.

(p6.1) In online supplemental appendix 2, the full assessment according to AMSTAR 2 tool was provided for each of the examined systematic reviews, including the seven critical domains marked in yellow and the final positive or negative rating.

(p6.2) Because of the real heterogeneity in the examined conditions and in studies design included in each systematic review, we did not use funnel plots and we choose to summarise the umbrella review results mainly through narrative synthesis and tables.
