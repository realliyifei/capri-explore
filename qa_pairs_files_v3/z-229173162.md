## (s9) Partial hepatectomy
(p9.0) In hepatectomy-induced LR, resected volume is closely correlated with the pattern of regeneration. In 90% hepatectomy models, the limited remained resources first meet the liver metabolic function to maintain the homeostasis of the body, resulting in the delay of LR [81]. For 70% hepatectomy models, traditional opinion suggests that almost all residual hepatocytes re-enter the cell cycle for mitosis. However, this is not the case. The adult human liver is comprised of more than 20% polyploid cells, while the number of polyploid cells is as high as 70% in rodents. After PH, polyploid hepatocytes achieve the increase in liver mass through hypertrophy [82].

(p9.1) Many studies have suggested that the volume of LR is significantly negatively correlated with future remnant liver volume (FRLV). However, the removal of a larger volume of liver may cause an increase in the release of mitogens such as TNF-a and IL-6 [83]. Pagano et al. reported that the imbalance between the remaining liver's function and the body's metabolic requirement became the most important factor in the regulation of LR. After determining the safe boundary of FRLV to avoid "small liver syndrome" and other related complications, a lower FRLV can promote LR [84].
