## (s3) Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine:
(p3.0) Anti-malarial drugs with satisfactory antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. First time in February, Wang et. al.

(p3.1) showed the activity of Chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro with an EC50 of 1.13 µM in Vero E6 cell-line (4). Previously these drugs also showed demonstrated good activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in various cell lines (5). On the same line, several clinical trials were conducted in China during this outbreak with 500 mg of Chloroquine. As per the data collected, during mid-February it was came out as published research that, "thus far, results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course according to the news briefing. Severe adverse reactions to chloroquine phosphate were not noted in the aforementioned patients."-Per Gao et.al. But due to the associated cardiovascular toxicity with chloroquine, a substitute compound which is structurally similar to chloroquine except a single difference of -OH group namely hydroxychloroquine paved the way to show efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. It showed an improved tolerability as compared to chloroquine. It acts via inhibition of CME (Clathrin mediated endocytosis) which consequently inhibit TF/TFR1 (Tissue factor; Transferrin receptors 1) complex uptake; along with it the endosomal pH raises and inhibition of iron removal from TF (Tissue Factor) within endosomes takes place. The raised endosomal pH also paves the way for inhibition of iron release in the cytosol through DMT1 (Divalent metal-ion transporter 1) and TRPML1/MCOLN1 (Mucolipin 1). The lysosomal autophagy pathway impairment result in inhibited iron release from FT (Ferritinophagy) all these possible processes ultimately cause the cellular iron starvation and inhibits the viral life cycle. Simultaneously, Macrophagic polarization and immune-adaptive response also get modulated and help the body's immunity to boosted up (6).

## (s4) Lopinavir/ritonavir:
(p4.0) During this COVID-19 outbreak a combination of Protease inhibitors i.e. Lopinavir/Ritonavir was frequently proposed and prescribed. It is the same drug which is used in the treatment of HIV-AIDS. It is readily available at a economic price point as it one of the HIV medication under the WHO essential list of medicines (7). The off-label use of this combination was considered because it inhibits one of the crucial enzyme3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) which is essential for processing of viral RNA leads to disruption of viral replication process. However, the SARS-CoV-2 is devoid of C2-symmetric pocket which is the major target of HIV protease inhibitors. Hence, raised several questions on the potency and efficacy of this combination (8).

## (s12) Effectiveness of herbal drugs
(p12.0) In the recent past due to the awareness towards the scientific evidence-based medicines the fields like clinical research, quality assurance and pharmacovigilance boosted up which demands a clinically proven and effective medicine for the use of masses without substantial adverse or side effects. Fortunately, at both international and national level various natural products have undergone stringent scientific pre-clinical and clinical studies as medical agents and concluded to be efficacious for treating the illness and promoting the health. As In the below section we tried to review a number of plants derived molecules based on the targeted drug approach for their action against the COVID-19.

(p12.1) Plant based Molecules having activity against SARS-CoV-2

(p12.2) As the matter of fact, SARS-CoV-2 has positive-sense single-stranded RNA with the largest RNA genome and as its genomic sequence noteworthy similarity to that of SARS-CoV. Hence antiviral drugs used to treat SARS and MERS are now being utilized for COVID-19 treatment. The efficacy of repositioned synthetic drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/umifenovir, oseltamivir, favipirapir, remdesivir as well as some other drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, interferon-β, hydroxychloroquine is still under evaluation and severe side effects is a cause of concern. Scientists are struggling to discover new curefor this deadly novel-coronavirus. This accentuated natural products as a treatment option for COVID-19 which could be both safe and effective and having immense medicinal properties such aspotent antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity. Natural compounds as well as with their synthetic or semisynthetic analogues may have benefit as therapeutic agents against coronavirus infection as they provide a wealth of chemical diversity displaying antiviral properties and can be utilized not only for strengthening our immune system but also killing the pathogens at the same time.As well as their natural amiability either in the form of standardized extract or as a pure compound based on ethnopharmacological assets plays a significant role in new drug development. Various drugs contribution from natural origin is significant as they have shown antiviral activity against number of viruses such as Influenza virus, Zika virus, Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Herpes simplex virus, Hepatitis B and C virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, and HIV including various coronaviruses. Secondary active metabolites of natural origin that show promise for the inhibition of coronavirus in humans are majorly polar compounds contained a conjugated fused ring structure mostly are polyphenols (39). Let us discuss in a bit detail about these molecules from natural origin and on what basis are they going to be use against the battle of coronavirus?

(p12.3) In-silico approaches Plant extract and plant derived active constituents exhibit distinct antiviral mechanism towards different viruses. Some of the phytochemicals target the viral envelope or the membrane proteins while other prevent the viral attachment to host cell as well as some phytochemicals denature the crucial viral enzymes required for viral genome replication and assembly. Recent advancement in computational approaches are playing an important role in the screening of drug and their design. To facilitate the speedy development of biologically active drug-like molecules that target multiple viral enzymes of the viral replication cycle for SARS-CoV-2. It is vital to employ in silico approaches in response to the global pandemic situation. These computational models determine the free binding of energy between a receptor and a ligand and with a lower free binding energy showing a stronger bond between Are herbal drugs effective in COVID management? A review to demystify the current facts and claims Page 14 of 31 the ligand and receptor. It is also beneficial for reducing the high costs and length of time required with physically screening large library of compounds or plant extracts for bioactivity. Further, these potential compounds can be assessed preliminarily through appropriate in vitro and in vivo models for their safety and therapeutic efficacy in lab. . The following are some of the relevant targets on which natural compounds can mark their actions:

(p12.4) Mpro Mpro (molecular weight 34 kDa) also called as the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is the main CoV protease, which plays an essential role in virus replication and controlling host cell response. The COVID-19 virus genome consists of ~30,000 nucleotides and its replicase gene encodes pp1a and pp1ab overlapping polyproteins necessary for viral replication and transcription. Mpro has highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket and responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein at no less than 11 conserved sites to release functional polypeptides. Therefore, Mpro stand as an attractive target for developing antiviral drugs against coronavirus.

(p12.5) Two compounds named Robustone and Schizolaenone B showed binding affinity value of − 7.8 kcal/ mol (Ki = 1.889 μM) and minimum band energy gaps exhibited strong potential as inhibitors of Mpro activity.The properties such as drug likeness, binding interaction with ligand, reactivity carried out by computational based approaches through ADMET, molecular docking and DFT-based computations. Robustone is a flavonoid compound having antioxidant property which was used as inhibitor against the protease of dengue virus and according to computer aided study exhibited great binding affinity against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.Schizolaenone B is a tetrahydroxy flavanone isolated from Schizolaena hystrix has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. In addition to this Osajin, IsosilybinA, Silybin A, Silydianin and Isopomiferin also showed the highest reactivity with the Mpro of 2019-nCoV in correlation with binding affinity (40).

(p12.6) The phytochemicals such as hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and aketoamide-11r exhibited the highest binding affinity and strong interactions with both or at least one of the catalytic residues (Cys145 and His41) of the main protease (41).Hypericin is an anthraquinone derivative and naturally occur in the yellow flower of Hyperium perforatum and has shown antiviral property by preventing the replication of encapsulated viruses. Along with this it has antidepressant, antineoplastic and immunostimulating activities. β-Sitosterol is well known for its multiple biological actions and is isolated from n-hexane extract of the M. calabura bark for phytochemical analysis. β-Sitosterol has stronger binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than favipirapir as it interacts with greater number of amino acids and forms more Van-der-waal forces with target molecule (42). In silico analysis demonstrated that the terpenoids bonducellpin D, caesalmin B and the flavonoid 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-40 -O-beta-d-glucopyranoside have promising binding affinity with Mpro of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV with potential values compared with repurposed drugs (43).Other natural metabolites capable of inhibiting the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in molecular docking are kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin-7-glucoside, demethoxycurcumin, naringenin, apigenin,7-glucoside, oleuropein, catechin, curcumin, and epigallocatechin. The antiviral activity of these flavonoids is beneficial as they can be easily available as they are welldistributed in the angiosperm families, such as Lauraceae, Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, and Leguminosae.
## (s15) TMPRSS2
(p15.0) After receptor interaction, different host proteases can activate the virus-host cell membrane fusion for subsequent viral genome delivery. The host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) activates spike protein present in the SARS-CoV-2.Cleavage of spike protein by TMPRSS2 is favoured in coronavirus infection over other proteases.SARS-CoV-2 entry is facilitated by TMPRSS2 and using the protease inhibition viral infection is decreased.TMPRSS2 is expressed in different cell types of lung tissue increasing their liability for SARSCoV-2 infections. Therefore,TMPRSS2 has emerged as a potential drug target for COVID-19.

(p15.1) Despite the fact that molecular docking indicates it as a strategy in COVID-19 treatment TMPRSS2 inhibitions search is the lowest within the major replication proteins.TMPRSS2 natural inhibitors includes terpenes, flavonoids, and peptides (49). Flavonoids baicalein and baicalin were reported as a down-regulators of the TMPRSS-2 expression, Lignans iridoids and diterpenes were also evaluated by in silico studies as potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors.

(p15.2) Other Potential Targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) facilitates the transcription and replication of RNA genome during infection and with its importance for the virus life cycle makes it as a drug target for antiviral development. The replication-transcription complex in coronavirus is formed after cleavage of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab into non-structural proteins. SARS-CoV RdRp need nsp7 and nsp8 as cofactors to stimulate polymerase activity. The association with exoribonuclease lead to the formation of a macromolecular assembly for systematic nucleotide polymerization, proofreading and cap-modifying. This multifunctional protein assembly and the 2-O-methyltransferase coordinate the replication-transcription machinery of SARS-CoV. The non-structural protein 15 have endoribonuclease activity that cleaves preferably at uridine residues. Helicase is an important protein in the replication-transcription complex of coronavirus that catalyses the processive separation of double -stranded DNA and RNA in a 5ꞌ -to -3ꞌ direction. As this protein is essential for the RNA viral synthesis therefore, it is considered as an emerging target for COVID-19.

(p15.3) Natural ligands from NPASS (natural product activity and species source) database were screened against six potential therapeutic targets such as helicase, endoribonuclease, exoribonuclease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, N-methyltransferase and Mpro by molecular docking experiment. Compound 2,3,4-trihydroxy benzoic acid, an anti-oxidant showed encouraging dockings scores compared to controls against endoribonuclease, exoribonuclease, RdRp, Methyltransferase and Mpro. Compounds such as astilbin and neostilbin also showed better docking scores against the aforementioned targets. (50). Astilbin is a flavanonol and neostilbin is enantiomer of astilbin. Astilbin have role as a radical scavenger, an anti-inflammatory agent.

## (s39) Effectiveness of herbal drugs
(p39.0) In the recent past due to the awareness towards the scientific evidence-based medicines the fields like clinical research, quality assurance and pharmacovigilance boosted up which demands a clinically proven and effective medicine for the use of masses without substantial adverse or side effects. Fortunately, at both international and national level various natural products have undergone stringent scientific pre-clinical and clinical studies as medical agents and concluded to be efficacious for treating the illness and promoting the health. As In the below section we tried to review a number of plants derived molecules based on the targeted drug approach for their action against the COVID-19.

(p39.1) Plant based Molecules having activity against SARS-CoV-2

(p39.2) As the matter of fact, SARS-CoV-2 has positive-sense single-stranded RNA with the largest RNA genome and as its genomic sequence noteworthy similarity to that of SARS-CoV. Hence antiviral drugs used to treat SARS and MERS are now being utilized for COVID-19 treatment. The efficacy of repositioned synthetic drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/umifenovir, oseltamivir, favipirapir, remdesivir as well as some other drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, interferon-β, hydroxychloroquine is still under evaluation and severe side effects is a cause of concern. Scientists are struggling to discover new curefor this deadly novel-coronavirus. This accentuated natural products as a treatment option for COVID-19 which could be both safe and effective and having immense medicinal properties such aspotent antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity. Natural compounds as well as with their synthetic or semisynthetic analogues may have benefit as therapeutic agents against coronavirus infection as they provide a wealth of chemical diversity displaying antiviral properties and can be utilized not only for strengthening our immune system but also killing the pathogens at the same time.As well as their natural amiability either in the form of standardized extract or as a pure compound based on ethnopharmacological assets plays a significant role in new drug development. Various drugs contribution from natural origin is significant as they have shown antiviral activity against number of viruses such as Influenza virus, Zika virus, Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Herpes simplex virus, Hepatitis B and C virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, and HIV including various coronaviruses. Secondary active metabolites of natural origin that show promise for the inhibition of coronavirus in humans are majorly polar compounds contained a conjugated fused ring structure mostly are polyphenols (39). Let us discuss in a bit detail about these molecules from natural origin and on what basis are they going to be use against the battle of coronavirus?

(p39.3) In-silico approaches Plant extract and plant derived active constituents exhibit distinct antiviral mechanism towards different viruses. Some of the phytochemicals target the viral envelope or the membrane proteins while other prevent the viral attachment to host cell as well as some phytochemicals denature the crucial viral enzymes required for viral genome replication and assembly. Recent advancement in computational approaches are playing an important role in the screening of drug and their design. To facilitate the speedy development of biologically active drug-like molecules that target multiple viral enzymes of the viral replication cycle for SARS-CoV-2. It is vital to employ in silico approaches in response to the global pandemic situation. These computational models determine the free binding of energy between a receptor and a ligand and with a lower free binding energy showing a stronger bond between Are herbal drugs effective in COVID management? A review to demystify the current facts and claims Page 14 of 31 the ligand and receptor. It is also beneficial for reducing the high costs and length of time required with physically screening large library of compounds or plant extracts for bioactivity. Further, these potential compounds can be assessed preliminarily through appropriate in vitro and in vivo models for their safety and therapeutic efficacy in lab. . The following are some of the relevant targets on which natural compounds can mark their actions:

(p39.4) Mpro Mpro (molecular weight 34 kDa) also called as the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is the main CoV protease, which plays an essential role in virus replication and controlling host cell response. The COVID-19 virus genome consists of ~30,000 nucleotides and its replicase gene encodes pp1a and pp1ab overlapping polyproteins necessary for viral replication and transcription. Mpro has highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket and responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein at no less than 11 conserved sites to release functional polypeptides. Therefore, Mpro stand as an attractive target for developing antiviral drugs against coronavirus.

(p39.5) Two compounds named Robustone and Schizolaenone B showed binding affinity value of − 7.8 kcal/ mol (Ki = 1.889 μM) and minimum band energy gaps exhibited strong potential as inhibitors of Mpro activity.The properties such as drug likeness, binding interaction with ligand, reactivity carried out by computational based approaches through ADMET, molecular docking and DFT-based computations. Robustone is a flavonoid compound having antioxidant property which was used as inhibitor against the protease of dengue virus and according to computer aided study exhibited great binding affinity against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.Schizolaenone B is a tetrahydroxy flavanone isolated from Schizolaena hystrix has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. In addition to this Osajin, IsosilybinA, Silybin A, Silydianin and Isopomiferin also showed the highest reactivity with the Mpro of 2019-nCoV in correlation with binding affinity (40).

(p39.6) The phytochemicals such as hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and aketoamide-11r exhibited the highest binding affinity and strong interactions with both or at least one of the catalytic residues (Cys145 and His41) of the main protease (41).Hypericin is an anthraquinone derivative and naturally occur in the yellow flower of Hyperium perforatum and has shown antiviral property by preventing the replication of encapsulated viruses. Along with this it has antidepressant, antineoplastic and immunostimulating activities. β-Sitosterol is well known for its multiple biological actions and is isolated from n-hexane extract of the M. calabura bark for phytochemical analysis. β-Sitosterol has stronger binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than favipirapir as it interacts with greater number of amino acids and forms more Van-der-waal forces with target molecule (42). In silico analysis demonstrated that the terpenoids bonducellpin D, caesalmin B and the flavonoid 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-40 -O-beta-d-glucopyranoside have promising binding affinity with Mpro of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV with potential values compared with repurposed drugs (43).Other natural metabolites capable of inhibiting the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in molecular docking are kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin-7-glucoside, demethoxycurcumin, naringenin, apigenin,7-glucoside, oleuropein, catechin, curcumin, and epigallocatechin. The antiviral activity of these flavonoids is beneficial as they can be easily available as they are welldistributed in the angiosperm families, such as Lauraceae, Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, and Leguminosae.
## (s42) TMPRSS2
(p42.0) After receptor interaction, different host proteases can activate the virus-host cell membrane fusion for subsequent viral genome delivery. The host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) activates spike protein present in the SARS-CoV-2.Cleavage of spike protein by TMPRSS2 is favoured in coronavirus infection over other proteases.SARS-CoV-2 entry is facilitated by TMPRSS2 and using the protease inhibition viral infection is decreased.TMPRSS2 is expressed in different cell types of lung tissue increasing their liability for SARSCoV-2 infections. Therefore,TMPRSS2 has emerged as a potential drug target for COVID-19.

(p42.1) Despite the fact that molecular docking indicates it as a strategy in COVID-19 treatment TMPRSS2 inhibitions search is the lowest within the major replication proteins.TMPRSS2 natural inhibitors includes terpenes, flavonoids, and peptides (49). Flavonoids baicalein and baicalin were reported as a down-regulators of the TMPRSS-2 expression, Lignans iridoids and diterpenes were also evaluated by in silico studies as potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors.

(p42.2) Other Potential Targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) facilitates the transcription and replication of RNA genome during infection and with its importance for the virus life cycle makes it as a drug target for antiviral development. The replication-transcription complex in coronavirus is formed after cleavage of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab into non-structural proteins. SARS-CoV RdRp need nsp7 and nsp8 as cofactors to stimulate polymerase activity. The association with exoribonuclease lead to the formation of a macromolecular assembly for systematic nucleotide polymerization, proofreading and cap-modifying. This multifunctional protein assembly and the 2-O-methyltransferase coordinate the replication-transcription machinery of SARS-CoV. The non-structural protein 15 have endoribonuclease activity that cleaves preferably at uridine residues. Helicase is an important protein in the replication-transcription complex of coronavirus that catalyses the processive separation of double -stranded DNA and RNA in a 5ꞌ -to -3ꞌ direction. As this protein is essential for the RNA viral synthesis therefore, it is considered as an emerging target for COVID-19.

(p42.3) Natural ligands from NPASS (natural product activity and species source) database were screened against six potential therapeutic targets such as helicase, endoribonuclease, exoribonuclease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, N-methyltransferase and Mpro by molecular docking experiment. Compound 2,3,4-trihydroxy benzoic acid, an anti-oxidant showed encouraging dockings scores compared to controls against endoribonuclease, exoribonuclease, RdRp, Methyltransferase and Mpro. Compounds such as astilbin and neostilbin also showed better docking scores against the aforementioned targets. (50). Astilbin is a flavanonol and neostilbin is enantiomer of astilbin. Astilbin have role as a radical scavenger, an anti-inflammatory agent.

## (s57) Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine:
(p57.0) Anti-malarial drugs with satisfactory antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. First time in February, Wang et. al.

(p57.1) showed the activity of Chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro with an EC50 of 1.13 µM in Vero E6 cell-line (4). Previously these drugs also showed demonstrated good activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in various cell lines (5). On the same line, several clinical trials were conducted in China during this outbreak with 500 mg of Chloroquine. As per the data collected, during mid-February it was came out as published research that, "thus far, results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course according to the news briefing. Severe adverse reactions to chloroquine phosphate were not noted in the aforementioned patients."-Per Gao et.al. But due to the associated cardiovascular toxicity with chloroquine, a substitute compound which is structurally similar to chloroquine except a single difference of -OH group namely hydroxychloroquine paved the way to show efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. It showed an improved tolerability as compared to chloroquine. It acts via inhibition of CME (Clathrin mediated endocytosis) which consequently inhibit TF/TFR1 (Tissue factor; Transferrin receptors 1) complex uptake; along with it the endosomal pH raises and inhibition of iron removal from TF (Tissue Factor) within endosomes takes place. The raised endosomal pH also paves the way for inhibition of iron release in the cytosol through DMT1 (Divalent metal-ion transporter 1) and TRPML1/MCOLN1 (Mucolipin 1). The lysosomal autophagy pathway impairment result in inhibited iron release from FT (Ferritinophagy) all these possible processes ultimately cause the cellular iron starvation and inhibits the viral life cycle. Simultaneously, Macrophagic polarization and immune-adaptive response also get modulated and help the body's immunity to boosted up (6).

(p66.3) In-silico approaches Plant extract and plant derived active constituents exhibit distinct antiviral mechanism towards different viruses. Some of the phytochemicals target the viral envelope or the membrane proteins while other prevent the viral attachment to host cell as well as some phytochemicals denature the crucial viral enzymes required for viral genome replication and assembly. Recent advancement in computational approaches are playing an important role in the screening of drug and their design. To facilitate the speedy development of biologically active drug-like molecules that target multiple viral enzymes of the viral replication cycle for SARS-CoV-2. It is vital to employ in silico approaches in response to the global pandemic situation. These computational models determine the free binding of energy between a receptor and a ligand and with a lower free binding energy showing a stronger bond between Are herbal drugs effective in COVID management? A review to demystify the current facts and claims Page 14 of 31 the ligand and receptor. It is also beneficial for reducing the high costs and length of time required with physically screening large library of compounds or plant extracts for bioactivity. Further, these potential compounds can be assessed preliminarily through appropriate in vitro and in vivo models for their safety and therapeutic efficacy in lab. . The following are some of the relevant targets on which natural compounds can mark their actions:

(p66.4) Mpro Mpro (molecular weight 34 kDa) also called as the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is the main CoV protease, which plays an essential role in virus replication and controlling host cell response. The COVID-19 virus genome consists of ~30,000 nucleotides and its replicase gene encodes pp1a and pp1ab overlapping polyproteins necessary for viral replication and transcription. Mpro has highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket and responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein at no less than 11 conserved sites to release functional polypeptides. Therefore, Mpro stand as an attractive target for developing antiviral drugs against coronavirus.

(p66.5) Two compounds named Robustone and Schizolaenone B showed binding affinity value of − 7.8 kcal/ mol (Ki = 1.889 μM) and minimum band energy gaps exhibited strong potential as inhibitors of Mpro activity.The properties such as drug likeness, binding interaction with ligand, reactivity carried out by computational based approaches through ADMET, molecular docking and DFT-based computations. Robustone is a flavonoid compound having antioxidant property which was used as inhibitor against the protease of dengue virus and according to computer aided study exhibited great binding affinity against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.Schizolaenone B is a tetrahydroxy flavanone isolated from Schizolaena hystrix has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. In addition to this Osajin, IsosilybinA, Silybin A, Silydianin and Isopomiferin also showed the highest reactivity with the Mpro of 2019-nCoV in correlation with binding affinity (40).

(p66.6) The phytochemicals such as hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and aketoamide-11r exhibited the highest binding affinity and strong interactions with both or at least one of the catalytic residues (Cys145 and His41) of the main protease (41).Hypericin is an anthraquinone derivative and naturally occur in the yellow flower of Hyperium perforatum and has shown antiviral property by preventing the replication of encapsulated viruses. Along with this it has antidepressant, antineoplastic and immunostimulating activities. β-Sitosterol is well known for its multiple biological actions and is isolated from n-hexane extract of the M. calabura bark for phytochemical analysis. β-Sitosterol has stronger binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than favipirapir as it interacts with greater number of amino acids and forms more Van-der-waal forces with target molecule (42). In silico analysis demonstrated that the terpenoids bonducellpin D, caesalmin B and the flavonoid 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-40 -O-beta-d-glucopyranoside have promising binding affinity with Mpro of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV with potential values compared with repurposed drugs (43).Other natural metabolites capable of inhibiting the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in molecular docking are kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin-7-glucoside, demethoxycurcumin, naringenin, apigenin,7-glucoside, oleuropein, catechin, curcumin, and epigallocatechin. The antiviral activity of these flavonoids is beneficial as they can be easily available as they are welldistributed in the angiosperm families, such as Lauraceae, Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, and Leguminosae.
## (s69) TMPRSS2
(p69.0) After receptor interaction, different host proteases can activate the virus-host cell membrane fusion for subsequent viral genome delivery. The host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) activates spike protein present in the SARS-CoV-2.Cleavage of spike protein by TMPRSS2 is favoured in coronavirus infection over other proteases.SARS-CoV-2 entry is facilitated by TMPRSS2 and using the protease inhibition viral infection is decreased.TMPRSS2 is expressed in different cell types of lung tissue increasing their liability for SARSCoV-2 infections. Therefore,TMPRSS2 has emerged as a potential drug target for COVID-19.

(p69.1) Despite the fact that molecular docking indicates it as a strategy in COVID-19 treatment TMPRSS2 inhibitions search is the lowest within the major replication proteins.TMPRSS2 natural inhibitors includes terpenes, flavonoids, and peptides (49). Flavonoids baicalein and baicalin were reported as a down-regulators of the TMPRSS-2 expression, Lignans iridoids and diterpenes were also evaluated by in silico studies as potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors.

(p69.2) Other Potential Targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) facilitates the transcription and replication of RNA genome during infection and with its importance for the virus life cycle makes it as a drug target for antiviral development. The replication-transcription complex in coronavirus is formed after cleavage of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab into non-structural proteins. SARS-CoV RdRp need nsp7 and nsp8 as cofactors to stimulate polymerase activity. The association with exoribonuclease lead to the formation of a macromolecular assembly for systematic nucleotide polymerization, proofreading and cap-modifying. This multifunctional protein assembly and the 2-O-methyltransferase coordinate the replication-transcription machinery of SARS-CoV. The non-structural protein 15 have endoribonuclease activity that cleaves preferably at uridine residues. Helicase is an important protein in the replication-transcription complex of coronavirus that catalyses the processive separation of double -stranded DNA and RNA in a 5ꞌ -to -3ꞌ direction. As this protein is essential for the RNA viral synthesis therefore, it is considered as an emerging target for COVID-19.

(p69.3) Natural ligands from NPASS (natural product activity and species source) database were screened against six potential therapeutic targets such as helicase, endoribonuclease, exoribonuclease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, N-methyltransferase and Mpro by molecular docking experiment. Compound 2,3,4-trihydroxy benzoic acid, an anti-oxidant showed encouraging dockings scores compared to controls against endoribonuclease, exoribonuclease, RdRp, Methyltransferase and Mpro. Compounds such as astilbin and neostilbin also showed better docking scores against the aforementioned targets. (50). Astilbin is a flavanonol and neostilbin is enantiomer of astilbin. Astilbin have role as a radical scavenger, an anti-inflammatory agent.
