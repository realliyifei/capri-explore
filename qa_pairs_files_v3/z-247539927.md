## (s2) ÔÅ∂ The Gut-Brain Axis and Ghrelin
(p2.0) The aquaphobic octanoyl moiety Esterhuysen to the 3rd serine remnant makes hunger hormone a twenty eight -aminoalkanoic -acid polypeptide autacoid. "Reverse pharmacology" was utilized to uncover ghrelin, which was previously thought to be an foundling G protein-linked enteroreceptor but is now recognized as the major ghrelin receptor, using the endogenous growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R).Following initiation of the GHS-R, it revealed that hunger hormone is a potent stimulant of GH production from mammalian somatotroph cells. It was discovered a fresh element of the somatotrophin for the first time. Phospholipase C, cAMP, and the nitric oxide/cGMP system are all involved in this activity.

(p2.1) The octanoylated mature hormone is released into the general body flow via the capillary networks of the gastric lamina propria. The stomach mucosa has the highest levels of ghrelin expression and secretion, whereas the pituitary and hypothalamus nuclei have the highest levels of GHS-R, leading to the theory that ghrelin and its receptor evolved to establish a connection.

(p2.2) The processes behind ghrelin's co-and posttranslational alterations are only now beginning to be unraveled. The hydrophobicity imparted by acylation may allow ghrelin to pass the bloodbrain barrier in both directions. This change also makes it easier for ghrelin to bind to the GHS-R, which is necessary for GHS-R-mediated ghrelin action. while the pancreatic may be the most prominent locus of expression in human tissues.

(p2.3) Moreover , it's tempting to think that paracrine GOAT expressing cells could acylate unacylated ghrelin produced from the stomach [17,18].
