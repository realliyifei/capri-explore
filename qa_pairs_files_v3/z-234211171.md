(p6.0) first author's name, time of the study, publication year, settings, sample size, prevalence of UTI, Genus, and mean age.


Statistical analysis

Comprehensive meta-analysis software was used for data analysis.The prevalence of UTI, antibiotic resistance, and bacterial agents was calculated by 95% confidence intervals.Due to the existence of heterogeneity among studies, a random effects model was used.I 2 and the Q-statistic tests were used for the assessment

(p6.1) f heterogeneity among studies included in the present review.P < 0.05 of Q-test and I 2 test >50% was considered statistically significant.

In this study, we evaluated the publication bias visually through the Funnel plot.If the distribution of articles is evenly placed inside the funnel, it indicates that there is no publication bias, and if they placed outside the funnel or there is a heterogeneous and unbalanced distribution inside the funnel, it indicates the presence of bias in the study publication.In addition to the Funnel plot, the statistical Egger's linear regression test was used to further investigate publication bias.According to this test, if the P < 0.05, it indicates the existence of publication bias; otherwise, if it is greater than this value, it indicates the abse
