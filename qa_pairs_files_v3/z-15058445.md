(p4.0) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium has used exome sequencing to evolve the decades -long strategy of analyzing melanoma somatic mutation at the at the single gene level. In general, melanomas are of neurologic concern and the related melanocytes arise neural crest cells, which also give rise to neural structures such as the iris, choroid and substantia nigra. The exome -based technique developed by TCGA has generated the largest database to date while elucidating the structure of 333 cutaneous melanomas [55].

(p4.1) As mentioned above, one of the strengths of WES is that is can identify overlapping genes between multiple diseases. Conversely, and equally instructive, WES can highlight diseases that do not share common genes. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia are two such examples [56]. Classification of disease subtypes is also useful as it can identify patient-specific genomic rearrangements such as those found in glioblastoma tumors [57].
