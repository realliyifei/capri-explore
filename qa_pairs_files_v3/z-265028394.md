## (s11) Country analyses
(p11.0) This study used VOSViewer software to analyze 54 studies to comprehend relations between countries and authors through a scientific map and recognize countries that contribute the most to the application of ML in health.Forty-eight counties participated in the analysis.The data were extracted from the Scopus database and used to create the bibliometric network.The type of analysis is co-authorship, and the unit is the country.The threshold for the minimum number of documents for a country is one.The network graph was generated based on the set parameters, with the previously determined total strength of co-authorship links with countries.

(p11.1) The Fig. 7 is the bibliometric map describing network among 48 countries of international co-authorship.In this visualization, the unit is the country, and they are specified as labels and circles.The more important a country, the larger its label and its circle relatively.The size of the circle is proportional to the significance of the country and the larger number of articles published by the authors from that country.The lines connecting circles represent collaborations between organizations in these countries [13].The thickness of the lines describes the number of publications, and an extended distance can show a weak similarity of works.Each circle has its own color and a set of similar color circles close to each other built cluster.Consistent with the clustering technique, VOSViewer splits into 10 clusters of different colors (yellow, purple, green, blue, orange, etc.), and there are large and small clusters [12].

(p11.2) It is clear from the map, that two clusters (yellow and purple) with spread connections and grander than the others.The yellow cluster represents countries with works linked to the United States (28,82%), and the next purple cluster illustrates works with the United Kingdom (25,88%).After the last two countries, one more European country might be mentioned, such as the Netherlands (14,12%) with 24 international collaborations, whereas Germany has 12 total links strengths and Portugal has two international collaborations.The leader among Asian countries is China (13,53%) with 23 total link strengths, followed by Hong Kong (22 links), and South Korea (12 links).
