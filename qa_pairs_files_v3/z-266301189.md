(p4.0) Note: RA, rheumatoid arthritis; OA, osteoarthritis; LN, lupus nephritis; erythematosus; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pDM, primary dermatomyositis; SSc, systemic sclerosis; FLSs, fibroblast-like synoviocytes; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; MH7A, a kind of synovial cell; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; BMSC, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; HSkMC, human skeletal muscle myoblasts cell.

(p4.1) accelerated the degradation of chondrocyte matrix in joints, and inhibited cartilage to play a joint-protective role.The exosomal lncRNA NEAT1 has been implicated in the abnormal proliferation of FLSs and the inflammation of the synovium by different pathway mechanisms (Rao et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2021).The NF-κB signaling pathway is known as an important role in the pathogenesis of RA, and p-p65 is a common indicator of the NF-κB signaling pathway activity (Duan & Li, 2018).Rao et al. (2020) found that the exosomal NEAT1 derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is involved in the pathogenesis of RA through the NF-κB signaling pathway.By searching for differential lncRNAs, they found that the NEAT1 expression was significantly higher the healthy control group.Therefore, this lncRNA may be involved in the abnormal activation of FLSs.To further explore the role of NEAT1 in FLSs, they used bioinformatics software to analyze miR-23a and SIRT6.As downstream genes of NEAT1, these two had a synergistic effect on the pathogenesis of RA through the NF-κB signaling pathway.Meanwhile, they assessed the cell viability of FLSs and the content of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-a) and p-p65 in serum and found that the levels of the above indexes in the plasma of patients were all increased compared with those of the control group.In addition to human fibroblasts, they injected NEAT1-loaded exosomes in a mice model of RA and found the same result.This further supported their conclusion that the exosomal NEAT1 derived from PBMC may participate in the pathogenesis of RA and could potentially serve as a diagnostic marker in the future.

(p4.2) Exosomal lncRNA Hotair has been implicated in the process of bone destruction in RA (Song et al., 2015).Its high expression could be detected in the peripheral blood of patients with RA.Experiments revealed that it could promote the activity of osteoclasts and activate MMP-2 and MMP-13 in synovial cells.The combined effects of Hotair on osteoclast activity and MMP activation synergistically contribute to joint damage and irreversible bone destruction.Thus, Hotair may also become a marker for disease diagnosis in the coming times.

(p4.3) In addition to causing inflammation and bone destruction in diseases, exosomal lncRNAs can exert a protective role.Exosomal lncRNA HAND2-AS1 has been found to inhibit the excessive proliferation of fibroblasts in RA patients through the NF-κB pathway and reduce the release of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-a, thereby preventing the progression of synovitis (Su et al., 2021).Further investigation into downstream regulatory genes and target genes revealed that HAND2-AS1 promotes the expression of TNFAIP3 and inhibits the regulation of miR-143-3p leading to the excessive proliferation and migration of FLSs through the miR-143-3p/TNFAIP3 axis.Moreover, HAND2-AS1 promotes the apoptosis of hyperproliferative cells, which reduces the release of inflammatory factors and allows the synovial environment to regain homeostasis.These findings open new possibilities for targeted management of the disease, offering potential therapeutic avenues for treatment.

(p4.4) The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network serves as a connection between coding RNA and non-coding RNA (such as microRNA, lncRNA, and siRNA, etc.) and this network enables the interaction and communication between these RNAs, leading to the enrichment of biological pathways, providing a possibility to explore the biological signaling pathways involving these genes (Qi et al., 2015).To note, it is common that a single gene in a disease can be involved in different signaling pathways.Through bioinformatics analysis, it has been discovered that the collaboration of these pathways often contributes to the occurrence of diseases.This coordination among pathways contributes to the complexity of disease pathogenesis.NEAT1, a special non-coding RNA, not only plays a role in the enrichment of the NF-κB signaling pathway, but also affects the proliferation and differentiation of T cells through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to the RA pathogenesis.
