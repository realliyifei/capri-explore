(p22.0) Exciting advances have been made over the past 20 years in many aspects of the role of waterbirds as dispersal vectors, and key priorities for more research have been identified. New technologies, particularly through bird tracking and eDNA analysis, have opened excellent opportunities for future work. Disparities in the geographical and taxonomic distribution of research effort need to be addressed.

(p22.1) Terrestrial and global change ecologists should pay more attention to the major influence of waterbirds, particularly given their fundamental role in allowing plants to shift their distribution to keep pace with climate change (mainly plant species assigned to classical dispersal syndromes that imply no LDD capacity), thus maintaining ecosystem functionality. We particularly highlight the involvement of waterbirds in the dispersal of organisms within and across terrestrial and aquatic landscapes. The importance of waterbirds as dispersal vectors makes it vital to take measures to increase the resilience of waterbird populations against human impacts (Amano et al., 2020;Breiner et al., 2021).
