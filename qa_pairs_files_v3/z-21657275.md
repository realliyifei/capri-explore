## (s1) CHAPTER 2 DEROUICH MODEL OF DENGUE FEVER
(p1.0) We first study the model of Dengue fever developed by Derouich et al in [3]. Their model is based on the compartmental diagram shown in Figure 2 For the human population, the model developed by Derouich et al., [3], takes the

(p1.1) The parameter values are described in Table 2.1. One of the key features of the model is the fraction, p, that represents a (random) fraction of the human population that can be permanently immunized against the four serotypes that cause Dengue fever.

(p1.2) For the vector population,

(p1.3) equations (2.1) and (2.2) can be combined into the single system

(p1.6) The main result of Derouich et al in [3] is that system (2.3) has two equilibrium

(p1.7) Î², M , and R are given by

(p1.8) . Analysis of the Jacobian at E 1 and E 2 shows that E 1 is globally asymptoti-

(p1.9) To develop a deeper understanding of the model we conduct several simulations.   [3].
