## (s20) Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator
(p20.0) In nutritional epidemiology, multicollinearity may be strong between nutrients, as well as between food groups.In observational studies, several confounding factors potentially measure slightly different variants of the same lifestyle characteristics (e.g., physical activity or alcohol drinking consumption).Interactions may also exist between dietary exposures and confounding factors (e.g., between dietary patterns and alcohol consumption or education).This makes fitting a standard regression model for assessing disease risk challenging.

(p20.1) Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a regression-based methodology that allows a large number of covariates to be included in the model and penalizes the absolute value of the regression coefficients, thus, regulating the impact a coefficient may have on the overall regression.The greater the penalization, the greater the shrinkage of coefficients (some reaching 0), thus automatically removing unnecessary/uninfluential covariates.Thus the LASSO minimizes regression coefficients in order to reduce the likelihood of overfitting.The algorithm shrinks the sum of the absolute value of regression coefficients, producing coefficients that are exactly 0, and thus selecting the nonzero variables to remain in the model.The shrinkage amount is controlled by the shrinkage parameter λ.

(p20.2) A critical choice in the LASSO method is selecting the appropriate amount of shrinkage, as controlled by λ.

(p20.3) We identified two papers [134,80] applying LASSO in nutritional epidemiology.The former paper [80] adopts the logistic LASSO in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2010 to estimate the association between a composite risk pattern, including diet and other risk factors, and self-reported breast cancer (binary variable, no/yes), in females ≥ 50 years.Based on 29 variables, including 21 macro-(density method) and micronutrients, alcohol, and coffee, the following variables: age, parity, vitamin B12, caffeine, and alcohol remain in the model, as far as the penalty parameter λ increases in the LASSO.This paper adopts the cross-validation technique to choose the optimal λ value.

(p20.4) In the latter paper, LASSO is not directly used to identify a disease-related risk profile, but as an alternative approach for assessing disease risk.Based on FFQ data from the NHANES 2005-2006, including healthy US adults (n = 2609), ten PCA-based dietary patterns (65% of the total variation) are associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors via the LASSO method.It is shown that the LASSO method outperforms the traditional linear regression model, by better predicting the levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol (LASSO adjusted R 2 = 0.861, versus traditional linear model adjusted R 2 = 0.163).The study adjusts for confounding factors such as age and body mass index.The authors also test the prediction accuracy of the model performance using an independent test set.
