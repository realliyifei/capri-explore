## (s19) Chiral Pool Methodology
(p19.0) Another approach to achieve highly enantiomerically pure forms of chiral derivatives of flavonoids is through the chiral pool strategy. This method was employed As a consequence of the medicinal relevance of chiral flavanones, Zhu et al. [101] were inspired by a biomimetic asymmetric reduction in NAD(P)H-dependent to synthesise the enantiomeric forms of these flavonoids. They proceeded to elaborate on the chiral [2.2]paracyclophane-based NAD(P)H models (CYNAMs), in which, after reaction conditions' optimisation, one of the models was applied to obtain enantiomeric tetrasubstituted alkene flavanones (Figure 29), culminating in the formation of most chiral forms in an enantiomeric excess array between 90% and 99% [101]. With this methodology, they were able to reinforce the importance of biocatalysis and the respective cofactors to enable the stereoselective synthesis of flavonoids with higher enantiomeric purity.
