Profitable Fischer Tropsch realization via CO 2 -CH 4 reforming; an overview of nickel-promoter- support interactions

Environmental pollution, climate change, and fossil fuel extinction have aroused serious global interest in the search for alternative energy sources. The dry reforming of methane (DRM) could be a good technique to harness syngas, a starting material for the FT energy process from greenhouse gases. Noble metal DRM catalysts are effective for the syngas generation but costly. Therefore, they inevitably, must be replaced by their Ni-based contemporaries for economic reasons. However, coking remains a strong challenge that impedes the industrialization of the FT process. This article explains the secondary reactions that lead to the production of detrimental graphitic coke deposition on the surface of active nickel catalyst. The influence of nickel particle size, impact of extra surface oxygen species, interaction of Ni catalysts with metal oxide supports/promoters, and larger fraction of exposed nickel active sites were addressed in this review. Size of active metal determines the conversion, surface area, metal dispersion, surface reactions, interior diffusion effects, activity, and yield. The influence of oxygen vacancy and coke deposition on highly reported metal oxide supports/promoters (Al 2 O 3 , MgO and La 2 O 3 ) was postulated after studying CIFs (crystallographic information files) obtained from the Crystallography open database (COD) on VESTA software. Thus, overcoming excessive coking by La 2 O 3 promotion is strongly advised in light of the orientation of the crystal lattice characteristics and the metal-support interaction can be used to enhance activity and stability in hydrogen reforming systems.a The least ratios obtained for both O/C and H/C are for dry reforming of methane hence, it has the highest susceptibility to coking than other reforming reactions but, the best for FT process.

## Introduction

The depletion of fossil fuel stocks, including coal and petroleum products, has spurred extensive study into hydrogen (H 2 ) as an environmentally benecial energy carrier for the postfossil fuel regime. At present, there seems to be a consensus that H 2 could be the most effective strategy for combating the trifecta of resource depletion, pollution, and climate change. [1][2][3][4] H 2 as an energy carrier and clean fuel might be a viable replacement for fossil fuels due to its great energy efficiency and absence of greenhouse gas emissions. 5,6 (i) Low-carbon pathways using fossil fuels, such as natural gas conversion and coal gasication, combined with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); (ii) biomass through biological processes such as anaerobic digestion, which used organic matter transformation and waste to energy; and (iii) the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using nuclear energy are some technologies for H 2 production. Over 90% of hydrogen is created from fossil fuels including coal, natural gas, and petroleum. However, hydrocarbon reforming, notably methane, and recent discoveries are the most signicant. 7,8 Interstellar methane incorporated in oil reservoirs along with landll a School of Chemical and Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310, UTM Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia.

DRM (1) has gained much interest since it uses two carboncontaining hazardous feedstocks (CH 4 and CO 2 ) to produce syngas with a 1 : 1 H 2 /CO ratio appropriate for use in chemical processes that could harness syngas such as FT energy process for liquid fuel and chemical manufacture. As well, the reaction can store and transmit energy. Despite its signicance in energy and material applications, it has not been fully deployed in the industry. The design of a DRM catalyst that is industrially acceptable and affordable is an ongoing challenge. Precious metals are obviously ideal as active catalysts for the DRM, but they are outrageously costly and scarce; therefore, substituting them with more economically affordable ones is unavoidable. [9][10][11][12] Nickel is the most commonly used active metal in CO 2 -CH 4 reforming catalysts due to its high intrinsic activity, availability, and inexpensive cost compared to precious metals and fairly notable catalytic behaviour. However, they suffer severe coking and subsequently deactivation due to harsh tuning operating conditions, catalyst preparation techniques, poor homogenous metal-support interface interactions, inaccurate metal oxide promotion, and a low surface carbon oxidation rate among others. [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] CH 4 + CO 2 = 2CO + 2H 2 , DH 0 298 K = 247 kJ mol −1 (1) Clear records in the literature [21][22][23][24][25][26][27] have addressed key issues regarding impediments to FT industrialization via DRM. Table  1 gives a summary of key ndings in some similar articles strategizing protable DRM processes. Major topics addressed in the current review centred on nickel crystal size, oxygen vacancy, pore size distribution, support acidity-basicity, nature of support-promoter interactions and reducibility effects. Additionally, the interaction between the support/promoter, with active metal (Ni) was studied aer analysing the crystallographic information les on VESTA, which is the novelty of the present review along with other problems impeding the coke formation in Ni catalysts.

Compared to steam reforming of CH 4 (SRM) (2), where coke deposition can be reduced by excessive amounts of steam, coke formation becomes more problematic in DRM since the coreactant (CO 2 ) also contributes to coke deposition. 37 

Although the kinetics and mechanism of reactions (1) and (2) are identical; however, the CO : H 2 ratio produced by DRM (1) is more valuable (near unity) for the Fischer Tropsch's (FT) energy process [39][40][41][42][43][44] although it has peculiar challenges.


## Vulnerability of Ni catalysts to coking

Susceptibility for coke deposition is predicted based on O/C and H/C ratios of the feed gas. Coke production is more likely in DRM with low O/C and H/C ratios of 1 and 2 respectively, in comparison to other CH 4 reforming techniques. Table 2 compares potential for coke formation in DRM, SRM and partial CH 4 oxidation (POM). 25,45,46 Side and main reactions encountered while dealing with the feed gases in DRM processes are given in (3) to (10) in addition to those discussed elsewhere. 47

Nucleation, predominantly occurs due to reactions (3), (6), (7) and (9) in undercoordinated spots of the Ni surface by producing carbon islands, which expand spontaneously. Coke formation and gasication are dynamically essential in both DRM and SRM reactions, and coke-free operations can only be attained when coke deposition does not overrate gasication. 48 However, coking phenomenon could give rise to catalytic coke, which is usually lamentous and proceeds via the metal carbide intermediate, non-catalytic coke which exhibits a spherical morphology usually formed under dehydrogenation atmosphere with a high degree of coalescence or bridging spheres, solid coke which forms via polynuclear aromatic intermediates or via the reaction of olens, acetylenes, dienes and free radicals. Coke deposits on DRM catalysts have been classied as graphitic, lamentous, amorphous or crystalline. Unlike the second, the rst is differentiated through its H/C ratio contents, where, the coke is predominantly, carbon rich with less hydrogen. Amorphous and crystalline cokes are identied with a high d-spacing broad and low d-spacing sharp XRD peaks respectively.

Reactions (4) and (5) represent the partial oxidation of methane (POM) under limited (4) and excess (5) oxygen supply; while, eqn (7) and (8) connote respectively, CO and CO 2 reduction. Consequently, thermodynamic investigations 15,39,49-54 of the reforming reaction have revealed that side reactions (3) and (6) are the primary drivers of carbon deposition, which occurs signicantly between 633 and 700°C; while the coke formation due to reactions (7) and (9) is affected by reactants molar ratio, and that of reaction (10) is the water gas shi reaction which is favoured at temperatures lower than 800°C. 55 


## Particle size-dependent effects of Ni catalysts

It has recently become possible to lessen the quantity of coke that is deposited on Ni catalysts by using a variety of methods.

According to earlier literature, 56-58 a high aggregate size of metal atoms favours CO and CH 4 dissociation on metal surfaces. Subsequently, one common practice is to make the Ni particles smaller. Generating Ni clusters is required for carbon deposition on a Ni surface, and it is widely reported that larger Ni particles result in severe coke deposition. 28 However, the endothermic nature of the dry reforming reaction causes the incredibly small Ni particles to get compressed and the size of the Ni domains to eventually grow quite large due to heavy coke deposition. Employing strong metal-support interactions as reported by 28,32 when working at high reaction temperatures maintains particle size of the Ni. Table 3 provides a summary of Ni particle size effects on some parameters of reaction. The turnover frequency (TOF) of Ni catalysts with varying particle sizes of 2.6, 5.2, 9.0, and 17.3 nm, as well as CO 2 and CH 4 initial and nal conversions for each particle size, and CO nal and initial uptake, were calculated to better understand the coking nature of Ni catalysts and the role of particle size-effect. Despite its relatively high Ni concentration, the 2.9 nm Ni-catalyst demonstrated the highest CO uptake levels at the reaction's beginning and end. Although it was assumed that the initial and nal TOFs for CH 4 and CO 2 would be superior in all catalysts, it became apparent that the smaller size cannot be disregarded.

During synthesis, the size of Ni particles might be reduced if there are powerful interactions between the Ni particles and their support (for example, Al 2 O 3 ). Also, the interaction could help reduce clumping since the support tends to keep Ni particles in place even when the temperature is high. At a long  
CH 4 þ 1 2 O 2 ¼ CO þ 2H 2 −22.6 2/2 = 1 8/2 = 4 CH 4 + 2O 2 = CO 2 + 2H 2 O −806 8/2 = 4 8/2 = 4 2CO = C + CO 2 −172 4/4 = 1 0 CO + H 2 = C + H 2 O −131 2/2 = 1 4/2 = 2 CO 2 + H 2 = CO + H 2 O 41.1 4/2 = 2 4/2 = 2
response time, however, particle size preservation becomes weak and most Ni particles will end up getting bigger. 59 


## Coke accumulation (build-up) effects

Thermodynamically, Ni catalysts have a high potential for carbon deposition. 60 Coke formation principally due to methane decomposition (3) and Boudouward reaction or CO disproportionation (6) is responsible for several issues; including the induction of a high-pressure drop and crushing of catalyst pellets, the clogging of the reactor, and the accelerated degradation of the catalyst. 31,32 Another mechanism for catalyst deactivation at high temperatures (>700°C) is the aggregation of active Ni species. 33,34 The ability to eradicate or limit carbon deposition to a minimal level is likewise consistent with the ndings of previous investigations. 61 Finely disseminated, small particle Ni size can rescue excessive sintering and agglomeration, regulate the acidity 62,63 and produce a catalytically active Ni size 1,27 that withstands carbon deposition. Several studies showed a Ni nanoparticle size threshold (2 nm or 7-10 nm) below which carbon deposition is reduced. 64 67,68 reported the activity and properties of Ni/ Al 2 O 3 and Ni-Si ME catalysts (whose SEM images are shown in Fig. 1). Aer DRM evaluation, a variation in morphology between fresh and expended Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was noticed; minute nickel particles and carbon deposits emerged. Aer 16 and 66 h time on stream (TOS), the silica-coated Ni and, impregnated Ni supported on mesoporous alumina catalysts had the best conversions and long-term stability. The high activity of the Ni-Si-ME was attributed to its small Ni particles, strong metal-support interaction, and homogeneous metal dispersion on silica.

Studies on coke gasication kinetics reported by Tingting et al. 48 implied the promotional impacts of Fe in MgO supported Ni-Fe alloy catalysts in CO 2 reforming of methane (depicted in Fig. 2(a)) and ascribed the delayed coke deposition and quicker surface-coke gasication to the Fe promotion without changing the pristine Ni catalyst's basic reaction mechanism or kinetic properties. The stimulating effect of Fe was found to be highly dependent on CO 2 levels in the contracting environment and Fe/Ni alloy ratios. Similarly, Zahra et al. 69 synthesized a series of Ni/SBA-16-MgO catalysts with various promoters (3 wt% of Y, Ce, and La) using a double-solvent technique and tested them in the CO 2 reforming of CH 4 . The graphical representation is shown in Fig. 2(b). Compared to the other catalysts, the Y-Ni/ SBA-16-MgO catalyst showed better activity due to ner and more dispersed nanoparticles size. The stability experiments revealed that further promotion with yttrium, lanthanum, and cerium made the catalyst more resistant to coking. Cerium promotion aided coke removal and prevented from forming on all catalysts. The Y-promoted catalyst had the highest NiO, which prevented the formation and spread of carbonaceous deposits.

The exceptional surface features of TiO 2 , aided its resistance to carbon deposition and great dispersion of nickel nanoparticles in Ni/TiO 2 catalysts, as reported by. 70 Additionally, the cluster (Fig. 3) depicts stressing signicance of particle size to the support, and its relation to surface area of Ni-catalysts during the CO 2 -CH 4 reforming to valueadded compounds in FT synthesis. The cluster was generated from plain text le of author keywords screening from 1000 articles on web of science. The central keywords in the construction of an appropriate DRM catalyst in Fig. 3 include coke resistance, catalyst surface area, alumina-supported Ni, MgO, and ZrO 2 support or promoters. The appearance of "coke resistance" close to "Ni" implies that coke resistance is critical to Ni DRM catalysts as reported by. 47 A comprehensive look into the 3 cluster shows the need for a coke-resistant Ni catalyst. The yellow centers on catalytic activity, resistance to coking, hydrogen production, silica, ceria and mixed oxides; while the blue cluster stresses on hydrogen production which is achieved through CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, as well as relationship between Ni-particle size, coke resistance and surface area of DRM catalysts supports.

Another appealing catalyst support, silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) is an amorphous substance utilized in microsystems as a dielectric in capacitors and transistors, as an insulator in various electronic devices, which is chemically inert and stable even at high temperatures. Loaiza-Gil et al. 71 employed an ammoniasynthesized Ni/SiO 2 catalyst to achieve a 60% methane conversion (at 700°C). At the same temperature, Guo and coresearchers 72 reported a methane conversion of 50 per cent using catalysts produced by impregnation and plasma breakdown (CH 4 : H 2 O of 1 : 1). At a lower reaction temperature (500°C ), Matsumura and Nakamori 73 evaluated a high-loaded methane steam reforming catalyst prepared by impregnating 20 wt% Ni/SiO 2 with a methane conversion of just 20%, with the catalyst deactivating completely aer 4 hours. The trend testies that methane reforming displays poorer activity at lower temperatures and high active metal loadings. Fig. 4(a) is based on the reports of Wenming et al. 8 according to which, a novel core-shell Ni-ZrO 2 catalyst small nickel nanoparticles as cores and microporous silica as shell (denoted as Ni-ZrO 2 @-SiO 2 ) was successfully developed for CO 2 /CH 4 dry reforming to produce syngas utilizing a one-pot simple approach. Under challenging reaction circumstances (800°C), the Ni-ZrO 2 @SiO 2 catalyst displayed excellent stability aer 240 h TOS compared to previously reported core-shell structured catalysts, with no coking aer 240 h TOS.

A complementary method for generating starting materials for the DRM, CO 2 methanation reported by Run-Ping and colleagues 74 utilized a Ni/SiO 2 catalyst by ammonia-evaporation method ( Fig. 4(b)). The ammonia-evaporation method (AEM) had a particle size of around 4.2 nm, substantially Ni/SiO 2 smaller than Ni-based catalysts made through impregnation. The specic surface area of the Ni/SiO 2 -AEM (446.3 m 2 g −1 ) was signicantly larger than that of hydrotalcite or perovskites. In comparison to Ni/SiO 2 -impregnation method (IM), the Ni/SiO 2 -AEM had a longer lifespan and a higher methane output. For 100 h at 370°C, there was no observed deactivation in the Ni/ SiO 2 -AEM, which is better than most previously reported Ni/ SiO 2 -IM catalysts, which deactivated aer 20 h TOS. Therefore, the AEM is a useful technique that can be employed for preparing coke-recalcitrant Ni-Si-based catalysts with high nickel loading and great stability. La 2 O 3 has been extensively explored due to its superior catalytic qualities, such as low methane ignition temperature and long-term stability. SEM images of La 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. 5(a)-(d) for example, superior activity in gradient temperature DRM was reported by Grabchenko et al. 75 for modied Ni/ La 2 O 3 catalysts Fig. 5(e). The greater activity of the Ni La CA-NH 3 sample was attributed to the production of carbonoxidizing La 2 O 2 CO 3 species and the interaction of small Ni particles with the support, which allowed for high dispersion during the reaction.


## Metal-support-promoter interaction and reducible metal-oxides

Active metal interaction with support or promoter materials is critical and remains a challenge in numerous important catalytic reactions including DRM. The metal-support interaction is usually signicant for a good reforming catalyst. Strong metal-support contact keeps active metal dispersion minimal at high DRM temperatures. 77 The greater the metal-support contact, the higher the temperature needed to break away and unite with a neighbouring metal particle, limiting agglomeration. Weaker active metal-inert support contact makes it more suitable for bimetallic catalysts because it improves metalmetal contact. 78 By starting the adsorption and activation stage, the support features specically for Ni-based catalysts control the DRM reaction route. A typical bi-functional DRM reaction pathway involves CH 4 activation on the active metal surface and CO 2 activation on a mildly acidic (Al 2 O 3 ) or basic (CeO 2 , La 2 O 3 ) support, whereas catalyst supported on inert silica-based materials follows a mono-functional pathway where both CH 4 and CO 2 activation are on the active metal surface. A semiempirical indication of the temperature at which sintering begins is the development of thermal resistance to Hüttig and Tamman temperature constraints in catalysts with signicant metal-support interaction. 21 The MSPI was suggested in the literature at optimum La 2 O 3 loading (near to monolayer) since excessive La-addition stimulates Ni migration from the surface to the bulk of the catalyst, resulting in a lower Ni surface area. The strength of metalsupport interaction (MSI) determines the build-up of particle sizes. A stronger interaction inhibits both CO and CH 4 disproportionation and other possibilities favouring product yield and stability. Although the impact of the support is multidimensional, CO 2 adsorption and decomposition on the support could have the most inuence. 5,77,[79][80][81] Increased catalytic activity in DRM, depends not only on the particle size of the active metal, rather literature [82][83][84][85][86] claims that support characteristics (textural qualities, redox attributes, surface basicity, reducibility, oxygen storage capacity and metal-support). Active metals localization in the support skeletal structures is controlled by catalysts synthesis methods. Notable ones reported to have excellent recalcitrance to coking and sintering by immobilization of Ni particles include mesosilica shell structure connement, immobilization in channels of polyolassisted mesoporous silica, alloy formation with a promoter, aerogel, sublimation-deposition connement 21 and solutioncombustion synthesis (SCS).

Yahia and co-authors 87 adopted SCS for the synthesis of K, Na, Cs, Li, and Mg-promoted Ni/La 2 O 3 catalysts for the DRM. At 700°C, all the samples showed substantial catalytic activity, with excellent CO 2 and CH 4 conversions above the equilibrium values. Unlike the unpromoted samples, boosted catalysts showed improved catalytic activity and durability, attributed to the high metal support interaction due to increased Lewis basicity. The Mg-Ni-La 2 O 3 exhibited outstanding anti-coking qualities. There are two main causes for this: rst, it has more surface area and porosity than its competitors, giving it the benet of more active DRM sites; and second, Mg was added, increasing the number of basic sites while maintaining high MSI and MSPI. This boosted CO 2 adsorption and the availability of oxygen species on the surface, so reducing coke formation and prolonging catalyst deactivation due to high-temperature sintering.


## VESTA analysis strategy and justication

Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis (VESTA) is a 3D (three dimensional) visualization tool that provides structural models for volumetric data, nuclear densities, and crystal morphologies for COD evaluation. It also provides information on the crystal phase, atom labels, bond sites, symmetry operations that supports around 47 data input structures format and 31 output formats. The selection of the package is inuenced by the necessity to nd the correlation between surface and bulk atoms of the chosen (Al 2 O 3 , MgO, and La 2 O 3 ) support/promoters for Ni DRM catalysts. The choice of these oxides is based on the work of by Guojie et al. 88 who reviewed supports and promoters of DRM catalyst from 2010 to 2017 and reported them as the most proven, most recommended and most utilized oxides amongst others.

To propose the nature of coke formation, seizure in the activity of DRM catalyst, the potency of oxygen vacancy and interaction between active metal, support and promoter, the CIF les of Al 2 O 3 -supported, MgO, and La 2 O 3 -promoted Ni catalysts were analyzed using Vesta soware; the orientation of the crystal shape, crystal structures and oxygen vacancies are presented in Fig. 6(a)-(c). A detailed examination of the crystal structures in Fig. 6 revealed a proposal on how the MSI and MSPI occur. The Ni particle size is in the order Ni/La 2 O 3 < Ni/ MgO < Ni/Al 2 O 3 ; therefore, it is highly anticipated that agglomeration at high DRM reaction temperatures will be dominant in the Ni/Al 2 O 3 and there will be a high susceptibility to metal sintering which corresponds to the reports of Tahir and colleagues. 89 Accordingly, scientic research soware have made easier, the exploration and analysis of complicated models. 81,90-95 A careful study the structural parameters, skeletal orientation, binding sites, and interaction between the support and active metal conrms that the oxygen atoms are more noticeable in the Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 6(c)) connoting a high possible rate of reducibility. Abdulrasheed et al. 21 reported that oxygen vacancies on support materials aid the oxidation of deposited coke to CO thereby reducing the coking potential and increase product yield. However, the possibility that metal-oxide overlayer effects may expose Ni particles to size shoot up at high DRM temperatures in Al 2 O 3 being more pronounced than the other two cannot be ruled out here. In contrast, the oxidation of Ni surface in Al 2 O 3 could inhibit the formation of coke, so for lowtemperature processes, Al 2 O 3 support may be the best alternative. However, under high DRM heating settings, it is anticipated that La 2 O 3 will exhibit greater stability and fundamental qualities that will promote CO 2 chemisorption.

At present, the de supports like, ZrO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , CeO 2 , TiO 2 , Co 3 O 4 , etc. are mainly utilized in dry methane reforming since they materials possess high oxygen vacancies, which could store a vast amount of oxygen under oxidizing conditions before releasing it under reducing requirements for CO 2 activation. 96 This capability dramatically controls CO 2 adsorption and activation and directly inuences the selection of the intermediate's reaction, thus improving the reforming activity. Indeed, the high release of oxygen or mobile oxygen by this reducible metal oxide support will further assist the suppression of coke during dry methane reforming, hence inhibiting the occurrence of catalyst deactivation and leading to stable reforming activity. 22 Besides the intense interaction between active metal and reducible metal oxides, supports also facilitate the suppression of metal growth, hence hindering the sintering phenomenon.

Steinhauer et al. 97 compared the reforming activity of Ni-Pd (5 wt%) catalysts supported over irreducible (g-Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 ) and reducible (La 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 , La 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 , TiO 2 ) metal oxides support. The authors noticed that most reducible supports employed in reforming exhibited a superior activity than irreducible supports in the order of ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 > La 2 O 3 > ZrO 2 > SiO 2 > Al 2 O 3 > TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). The observed trend was accredited to the strength of metal-support interaction created along with the excellent distribution of active Ni-Pd over the employed support. The authors also claimed the blockage of active sites was responsible for the inferior reforming activity recorded for TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 . The superior activity resulting from La 2 O 3 employment as support for Ni-based catalysts in dry methane reforming agreed with the ndings of Fatesh et al. 98 In a different study, Naeem et al. 99 investigated the role of support g-Al 2 O 3 , CeO 2 , and ZrO 2 toward the dry methane reforming activity of Ni (5 wt%) catalysts, synthesized through a polyol approach. By carrying out the dry methane reforming at 973 K, Ni-supported reducible ZrO 2 demonstrated the highest catalytic performance (CH 4 conversion = 87.2%), followed by Ni-supported g-Al 2 O 3 (CH 4 conversion = 87.2%), and Ni supported CeO 2 (CH 4 conversion = 83.2%). It was justied that the superior activity by Ni/ZrO 2 corresponded to unique features of ZrO 2 , including high surface acidity, reducibility, redox potential and thermal stability.

On the contrary, Zhang et al. 32 found that the Ni supported by reducible metal oxides like ZrO 2 and TiO 2 demonstrated lower catalytic activity as compared to irreducible metal oxide (SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 and MgO). The authors justied that Ni/ZrO 2 and Ni/TiO 2 suffered poor performance due to weak MSI associated with the low Ni distribution on the small surface area of reducible metal oxides (TiO 2 = 9 m 2 g −1 , ZrO 2 = 25 m 2 g −1 ). Moreover, Ni/ZrO 2 and Ni/TiO 2 exhibited the highest accumulation of coke, about 21.0 and 24.7 mg g cat −1 h −1 , respectively.

A similar agreement was reported by Naeem et al. 98 where the inferior activity of Ni supported with reducible CeO 2 support has resulted from low Ni active metal distribution on the CeO 2 surface, thus leading to an increment in Ni crystallite size. Consequently, this condition favoured the high coke accumulation (0.025 g g cat −1 h −1 ) on the low surface area of CeO 2 compared to Ni/ZrO 2 (0.02 g g cat −1 h −1 ) and Ni/g-Al 2 O 3 (0.015 g g cat −1 h −1 ). On the contrary, the high surface area of irreducible  metal oxides such as SiO 2 (239 m 2 g −1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (167 m 2 g −1 ) caused excellent Ni distribution, providing a more accessible active site, hence leading to high catalytic performance. Wang and Ruckenstein 100 assessed the reducibility of metal oxide supports, including Ta 2 O 5 , ZrO 2 , Nb 2 O 5 , TiO 2 , and CeO 2 , through temperature-programmed reduction analysis. A signicant reduction peak assigned to TiO 2 , CeO 2 , and Nb 2 O 5 appeared around 1023 K, 1123 K, and 1163 K respectively; while there was no noticeable reduction peak revealed by Ta 2 O 5 and ZrO 2 (Fig. 8(a)). The reducibility strength of the tested metal oxide support declined in the order of CeO 2 > Nb 2 O 5 > TiO 2 > ZrO 2 > Ta 2 O 5 , which agrees with ndings reported by Tauster and Fung. 77 However, the authors highlighted that these metal oxide supports are inappropriate for dry methane reforming, which is ascribed to low conversion and yield. They reported that irreducible metal oxides, namely MgO and Al 2 O 3 , provide superior and stable performance with time compared to those tested with reducible metal oxide support.

Furthermore, Li and Veen 5 evaluated the impact of reduction temperature on reducible CeO 2 -supported Ni nanoparticles and reported that the reduction of CeO 2 support in H 2 within 773-973 K led to an intense bonding between the CeO 2 support and Ni, thus suppressing Ni particle sintering. However, when the reduction is conducted at a higher temperature, it was found that Ni nanoparticles were encapsulated by the migration of CeO 2 from reduced support. Consequently, this phenomenon caused the decline in the catalyst capability for both CH 4 and CO 2 adsorption/activation, leading to lower catalytic performance, although low coke accumulation was recorded.

Since the reducible metal oxides mainly contributed to coke suppression compared to increased performance, some modi-cations towards the reducible metal oxide have been extensively reported in the literature. For instance, Bellido et al. 101 successfully modied ZrO 2 support on nickel catalyst by introducing CaO (8 mol%) and evaluating its activity in dry reforming methane at 800°C for about 6 h. It was noticed that the incorporation of CaO led to the increment in oxygen vacancies in the reducible support, which facilitated the reduction of NiO to active Ni. This improvement effectively caused the increment in the number of the accessible Ni active sites on the support, thus enhancing the catalytic activity up to CH 4 conversion = 66.5% and CO 2 conversion = 76.3% in dry methane reforming. Nevertheless, the authors highlighted that the increment of CaO addition towards ZrO 2 support (>8 mol%) caused a considerable drop-in reforming activity (reactant conversion lower than 50.0%). This negative trend has resulted from the excessive presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface, which hinders the CO 2 activation. A similar trend was reported by Roh and Jun 102 during the modication of support with different loading of CaO (0.04-0.06) for dry methane reforming. Furthermore, they also emphasized that the modication by CaO enhanced the basicity of the catalyst, leading to effective suppression of coke, hence improving the stability performance of the catalyst.

In other efforts, Pietraszek et al. 84 studied the effect of reducible support modication over 5 wt% Ni-based catalysts for dry methane reforming. The authors modied Ce 2 Zr 2 O 8 by incorporating 0.5 wt% noble metal, Rh and Ru via a pseudo-solgel strategy. It was found that the modication of Ce 2 Zr 2 O 8 support by Rh and Ru effectively boosted the catalytic activity up to 87% compared to unmodied support (76%). The studies revealed the growing reection peak related to Ni species in XRD analysis, which prompted the increase in the number of Ni active sites. Furthermore, they observed better catalytic stability following the change due to both noble metals' superior coke suppression capabilities.


## Dispersion, pore distribution, oxygen vacancy and acidity-basicity effects

The evenness of active metal dispersion over the support inuences performance of catalysts 85,103 and properties such as agglomeration, activity and stability are dependent on the active metal dispersion. Excellent dispersion in Ni catalysts is essential for anti-carbon ability, high cross-sectional area and turn over frequencies for DRM reactions.  Highly-loaded active metal catalysts experience blockage of the pores, and this defect is overcome with a moderate Ni loading. Contrary to type I hysteresis mostly reported for microporous materials, the BET adsorption-desorption isotherm for mesoporous materials (typically, type IV), implies a multilayer adsorption, followed by capillary condensation. The amount of unlled pore space (p/p 0 ) represents the empty pores identied aer multilayer covering has been lled with condensate and isolated from the gas phase. A hierarchical or multi-modal pore structure may be inferred from the BJH based on the pore size distribution that is displayed. The occurrence of metastable states linked with the capillary condensation of probe molecules on mesopores causes hysteresis loops to occur oen at high relative pressures. However, low pressure hysteresis phenomena have been reported for porous solids such as ordered mesoporous SiO 2 , zeolites and activated carbons. 79,104 The oxygen vacancy increases the electron density of metal, stimulating a weakening of the carbonyl group (C]O) bond on CO 2 over the metal sites. These imply that oxygen vacancies preserves the metal in the active metallic phase and hinder coke accumulation. In bifunctional catalysts, it provides labile electrons that improve the electrostatic interactions between metal and support, stabilize metal phases, and produce labile oxygen ions for carbon gasication both of which are mobilised to the nearby unpaired electron-decient metal cations, resulting in electrostatic interactions. By using this property, the difference in relative intensities can be used to gure out how strongly the oxygen vacancies and active metal particles interact with the support. 64 Similarly, acidity or basicity of the support that affects the coke deposition and, the catalysts life. 9 For example, it has been found that increasing the Lewis basicity of the support can increase the chemisorption of CO 2 , in particular when using alkaline earth metals (MgO, CaO, and BaO), which are predominantly studied as promoters, modiers, and supports. The generation of coke is reduced to an absolute bare minimum as a result of the CO 2 activation, which also enhances catalyst deactivation. 18,45 At excessive surface acidity, the catalyst deactivation fast occurs due to the CO 2 disproportionation, which favours coking over syngas conversion, followed by metal oxide formation. RWGS reaction is usually favoured at higher CO 2 than CH 4 conversions and conrmed by the presence of water droplets at the reactor outlet. 21 At moderate acidity and basicity, however, DRM occurs without appreciable deactivation because CO 2 and CH 4 show comparable activation energy. In practice, the alkalinity of La 2 O 3 coupled with the connement strategy of the mesoporous shell improves the overall catalytic performance of the catalyst.

Promoters play the role of improving the properties of the active phase. For example, the addition of CaO and MgO increases CO 2 conversion, by forming strongly ionic oxides that attract CO on the catalyst surface; 11,105-107 potassium addition improves the reducibility of metal particles; decrease the concentration of nickel ensembles leading to carbon formation by behaving as a coke gasication additive. 6,108 Table 4  summarizes the properties of some common metal oxide supports and promoters.


## Future and prospects

The success stories that have been documented in the laboratory and the pilot scales of the plant suggest that the FT is closer than ever, to being realized commercially. However, efforts can focus on important perspectives thus: (i) Given the signicance of the CO 2 conversion in the preceding discussion of the RWGS reaction, it is necessary to strategize such that the CH 4 conversion can outweigh that of CO 2 , since a higher CO 2 conversion indicates the occurrence of the RWGS reaction, which impedes the formation of syngas.

(ii) Smaller Ni particles are reduced at low temperatures while agglomeration of Ni particles happens at high temperatures. However, stability of catalysts can be improved by loading optimum amount of Ni, increasing the Lewis basicity of DRM catalysts supports and careful selection of good promoter and preparation method.

(iii) Low and high-temperature DRM reactions have advantages and disadvantages each, and the FT requirement prefers the DRM over the other possibilities due to its less O/H and C/H ratios. Establishing MSI and MSPI of other transition metal and inner transition metal oxides is highly encouraged.

(iv) To complement the claim raised by researchers based on data available in the literature, VESTA can be utilized for proposing the possibilities of other emerging metal oxides supports and promoters.


## Conclusion

The induced impact of Ni surface-decoration by metal oxide supports such as MgO, La 2 O 3 , or CeO 2 in suppressing coke formation in DRM is described in the current review article. The role of Ni-particle sizes; supports morphology and promoters' interactions with emphasis on critical observation of synergistic interplay among these properties for performance enhancement.

Interactions between Ni catalyst and metal oxide supports, nickel particle size, and surface oxygen species is shown to provide an enhanced coke suppression. Selecting the appropriate reducible support can increase reforming activity and stability while minimizing coke accumulation.
