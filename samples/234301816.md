In this review paper to analysis of the structural wood -I joist section also determine the bearing capacity of I -Joist section. In a circular holes in the webs of wood I -Joists for the remediation techniques used for evaluation. In this review study also investigation of elastic tensional Buckling capacity of wood I -Joists.I.

## INTRODUCTION

Wood composite I-joists represent a sizeable portion of new residential construction floor systems. I-joists are created from solid sawn, or more commonly, structural composite lumber (SCL) flanges connected with an oriented strand board. As the complexity of residential housing increases, wood I-joists are being used in various configurations, including longer span distances and continuous and cantilevered beams. The OSB web element constitutes a thin walled structure.      Abhishek Shrivastava et al. 


## III. CONCLUSION

In these review studies of structural wood I-joists section to analyze the behaviour of Wood -I Joist Member and also the properties of Wood I-Joists Section.


Rémi St-Amour, Ghasan Doudak (2017):-In this paper the elastic lateral torsional buckling capacity of wood I-joists. A sensitivity analysis determined that the orthotropic material properties that affect the critical buckling load of wood I-joists are the longitudinal modulus of elasticity, The transverse shear modulus of the flanges and the elastic modulus of the web.

Amjad Islam, Tatek Debebe, Stephen U. Nwokoli (2011):-In this research study the bearing capacity of wood based I-joists was analyzed. To determine the bearing capacity of I-joists by using the finite element software.

Rémi St-Amour (2016):-In this study on experimental investigation on material properties and critical buckling load of 42 wood I -Joist. FE model is used to reproduce the nonlinear buckling behaviour of the wood I-joist and provide an accurate estimate of the lateral torsional buckling capacity using the linear buckling analysis.

Miller, and Rakesh Gupta (2013):-In this paper was to Evaluate of Remediation techniques for circular holes in the webs of wood -I Joists. Seven remediation techniques was investigated initially and remediation effectiveness was evaluated on the basis of Strength, Stiffness and ease of installations cost.

Benoît Pelletier (2017):-To investigate the lateral torsional buckling of wooden I-joists.In a numerical 3D model was also developed using commercially available finite element program ABAQUS to determine the buckling loads and associated mode shapes of joists similar to those tested. In a FEM model was capable of Abhishek Shrivastava et al. Wood Orthotropic Principal Axes, Benoît Pelletier, 2017 6. Joseph A. Yura (2001):-In this paper is to be provide a fairly comprehensive view of the subject of beam stability bracing. The following factors that are affect bracing requirements will be discussed and Proposed design method.
