Supplementary Table 1. Lianhuaqingwen, a traditional Chinese Medicine formulation. Supplementary Table 2: Functions of Vitamin-C and Vitamin-D. Supplementary Table 3: Source of Various Vitamins from Animal, Vegetables and Fruits (141, 142). Supplementary Table 4. Recommended Daily Allowance of Mg (198).


## Supplementary

Calcitriol improves the phagocytic activity of macrophages and promotes their movement.

It can regulate the expression of the antimicrobial proteins defensin and cathelicidin responsible for direct killing of pathogenic bacteria and inhibits the production of IFN (38-40)

It enhances antibody levels (78,83-85) It enhances the monocyte differentiation into macrophages (33) Vitamin-C increases cytokine production (75,77,86-94) and decreases histamine levels (56,61,95-101)

Vitamin-D Promotes the processing of antigen.

Helps in the down regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) (30-33).

## Table 2 :
2Functions of Vitamin-C and Vitamin-DFunctions of Vitamin-C 
Functions of Vitamin-D 

Increase collagen synthesis,fibroblast proliferation,keratinocyte 
differentiation, motility/chemotaxis,phagocytosis,ROS generation 
and lipid synthesis (30-35) 

It could protect lungs from infection, maintain the 
normal function of renal epithelial barriers, and 
improve the functions of corneal epithelial barriers 
function (32-35) 

It works as an antioxidant/electron donor (50-53),enhances 
microbial killing (54,55,57,58,70,72),helps apoptosis and 
clearance (71,73,74),decreases necrosis/NETosis(73,75)
