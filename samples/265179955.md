Professionalism in medicine is a trust based social contract between professionals and public wherein professionals are expected to subordinate all their interests to the larger interests of patients and public.Recent commercialization trends have eroded ethical as well as scientific underpinnings of this sacred profession.This situation calls for immediate and planned resuscitative measures to reverse it.Healthcare professionals particularly dual job holding doctors are the key persons in this regards.To systematically examine literature on perceptions of doctors about dual jobs and its effects on professionalism in resource limited settings, through systematic searches of Medline, Ovid, ERIC and Science Direct combined with grey search from Google Scholar and hand search from reference lists and selected journals, eighteen articles were found appropriate to be included in this review.Six themes were identified: dual job and motives behind private practice; monetary gains and non-professional behavior; threats to professionalism and professionals; medical education's role in building up professionalism; economic principles, law & medical professionalism and governance in healthcare development.The results suggest a clear paucity of qualitative studies on perceptions of doctors with dual jobs about the practices of professionalism in both public and private sectors and their views about remedial measures in low income settings.The review highlighted the need to explore the perceptions of the key elements i.e. doctors; particularly those with dual jobs about the practices of professionalism in public and private sectors along with their proposals about remedial measures in resource limited settings.

## INTRODUCTION

Respectability conferred upon doctors is because of the care they provide to the finest creature on the face of earth -"We create man in the finest state" (Qur'an 95:4, Oxford World's Classic edition).It is, therefore, morally expected that those engaged in this noble profession will continue to prove to be trustworthy and the authority granted to them through licensing and credentialing shall consistently be reciprocated with high standards of competence and accomplishment of moral responsibilities.As such, they will subordinate all their interests, monetary and others, to the higher values of responsibility to patients and public interests. [1]adual intrusion of commercialism in healthcare throughout the world [2][3][4] has transformed the mutually trusting and rewarding [5][6][7] traditional doctor-patient relationship of care and trust into questions of cost and benefit. [8][11][12][13][14] The question, "what are the perceptions of such doctors themselves about the  practices of professionalism in the two sectors" forms the basis of present review.


## METHODOLOGY

We followed the protocols and methods of Haig and Dozier [15,16] in our systematic search through Medline, Ovid, ERIC, Science Direct and grey search from Google Scholar (Figures 1 and 2) conducted between Jan to March 2016.To enhance search sensitivity, selected medical education journals (Medical Education AND Medical Teacher) and the reference list of the studies so selected were hand searched.A total of eighteen articles were found appropriate for inclusion in review process.

Key search terms relating to "Professionalism", "Dual jobs", "Doctor" and "Perceptions" were identified and piloted to enhance scope for the search (Table 1).Similar search terms were employed through all databases.Boolean commands (OR and AND) were used as required to combine search terms to form appropriate strings for search topics.

Peer-reviewed journal publications written in English focusing on Professionalism, Attitude, Medical Education, Public sector, Dual job, Healthcare Economic Policies and Ethics were included in the review.There were no restrictions on study designs, or  Gadit 2011 [14]   Corruption in medical practice: How far have we gone

## RESULTS

Flow chart in Figure 3 below shows application of inclusion and exclusion criteria as per guidelines for presenting results of systematic reviews. [17]Key features of the review articles/opinion and debates/critical commentary are summarized in Table 2 while those of quantitative/qualitative and mixed method studies in Table 3.


## SYNTHESIS

Six Dominant Themes were identified in the selected articles: dual job and motives behind private practice; monetary gains and non-professional behavior; threats to professionalism and professionals; medical education's role in professionalism; economic principles, law & medical professionalism and governance in healthcare development.They are presented in Table 4 and discussed separately.


## DISCUSSION

Themes identified through meta-synthesis:


## Dual job and motives behind private practice in healthcare

Monetary gains remain the most important source of power and a means of living in the minds and hearts of mankind ever since its birth.There is no doubt that time in one's life & properly earned and genuinely spent wealth are the only two assets which can make his/her life in this world and in hereafter (for those who believe in it) either an ultimate success or a permanent total failure.A qualitative study [12] identifies monetary motives behind dual jobs and that dual job holding doctors are a net benefit so long as they handle conflicts of interests properly.A review [11] examines the policy options for regulating dual job and its potential as a possible solution system in resource limited settings.Authors support a public recognition of dual job holding and introduce a strategy of professional self-regulation through this.


## Non-professional behavior in healthcare for monetary gains

True to the proverbial mirage, "Money makes the mare go" one is naturally inclined towards monetary gains and doctors are no exception to it.It is only when monetary benefits become the sole objective of one's life that nonprofessional attitudes come up.30][31][32][33][34] Threats to healthcare professionalism and professionals "Financial motives are incompatible to promoting altruism" [20]  The presence of private sector and dual job holding doctors is a net benefit, not only to doctors as financial gain but also to their private patients and public sector, so long as they properly handle conflicts of interests in the larger interests of patients and the nation Schlesinger 2002 [27] A loss of faith:

Bhatti 2011 [28]   Administrative professionals and the diffusion of innovations: the case of citizen service centers


## Mixed methods research 271

Importance of the role of administrators and executives in implementing the policies and innovations in all fields of the society is a basic principle.So with commercialism, the profession is transforming from mutually rewarding and trusting [5][6][7] philanthropic services delivered with dedication, compassion and concern, to the sale of a commodity in a commercial market.This has led to the transformation of traditional doctor-patient relationship of care and trust in to questions of cost and benefit.The public is losing faith in medical professionals and rightly perceive that attitude of the doctors working in both sectors is better with their private clients. [27]This has posed threats to laissez faire pattern, security of career and socioeconomic mobility of the professionals. [1,19]


## Medical education's role in healthcare professionalism

Whenever in the history of mankind, materialism would come up as a killer of humanity and the moral values deteriorated, prophets from within the same people with divine guidance would be deputed by Almighty to educate the people in faith and moralities.This golden strategy holds true even today and the prophetly activity of education still has and shall continue to have the full potential to reverse the deteriorating moralities.Hence medical education is of paramount importance [23] to inculcate deep rooted professionalism which is central to sustaining the public's trust in the medical professionals.

Certain key precepts [24] in this regards are helpful to guide both faculty staff and students for successful professional identity formation.


## Economic principles, law & medical professionalism

Legalities guide internally motivated ones and penalties are only for minority of people.No law can gear up non motivated, disgruntled lot and no society can afford to disable majority of its people through penalties.For the motivated ones too, society needs to have a code of ethical [8] and professional norms which standardize the attitudes and interpersonal relations yet not compromising upon the scientific and moral underpinnings of professionalism to meet the financial crisis. [9,21]vernance and healthcare development No matter how excellent a code and /or reforms thereof may be; they need strong yet flexible governance and its mechanics for implementation.Internal motivation, however, remains the most important driving force.Role of the public health sector in the face of overall inequity and disparity in providing healthcare to rural and urban areas needs to be redefined. [35]Policy measures to regulate dual jobs have their own pros and cons [26] and need to be analyzed in a broader context.Role of regulatory measures and political stability [22] in improving healthcare system, however, is important as is the role of administrators and executives in Humphrey and Russell 2004 [12]   Dual jobs and motives behind private practice Self-regulated Dual job holding can be a possible solution system to problems such as limited public sector resources and incomes as well as low regulatory capacity of government.Private sector and the dual job holding are beneficial, for doctors, private patients and public sector, as long as conflicts of interests are properly handled in the larger interests of the patients and the nation Gadit 2011 [14]   Bansal and Das 2005 [10]   Mahajan 2010 [18]   Monetary gains and corruption When financial gains become the sole objective of one's life, corruption is bound to occur

Benatar 1998 [19]   Sullivan 2000 [1]   Schlesinger 2002 [27]   Voo 2015 [20]   Threats to professionalism Deteriorating professionalism results in inequities and disparities in healthcare nationally and globally giving rise to loss of faith in medical professionals among public and elites.This in turn results in threats to laissez faire pattern, security of career and socioeconomic mobility of the professionals.Financial motives are incompatible to promoting altruism and professionalism has to be inculcated as a virtue

Cohen 2006 [23]   Brody and Doukas 2014 [24]   Medical education's role in professionalism Professionalism has central role in resuscitating the public's trust in healthcare professionals and is of paramount importance in inculcating the deep rooted professionalism Some assessment tools assess only observable behavior but not the moral values and attitudes.Certain key precepts help students to avoid common and unreflective misunderstandings about professionalism guiding both faculty and students to address the deeper issues required for formation of successful professional identity Donohoe 2004 [9]   Franz Porzsolt [21]   Perry 2012 [8]   Economic principles, law & medical professionalism Ethics should have its chair on the table while making any reforms in health care policies.Temptations to erode scientific and moral underpinnings of the professionalism in order to meet financial crisis even at institutional level have negative impact on training of the future doctors.One can manage to economize the patient care yet respecting the patients' requirements and their preferences while avoiding un-necessary risks and expanses De Costa 2007 [26]   Garc´ıa-Prado and Gonz´alez 2007 [22]   Pappas et al.

[

Bhatti 2011 [28]   Governance and healthcare development On the face of dominant & heterogeneous private healthcare sector and disparity in healthcare provision in rural and urban areas, public sector can assume a new role i.e. a constructive oversight on entire healthcare system (both private and public) balanced with provision of services where necessary.Such a public-private partnership will ensure equity of access to healthcare facilities for all Private healthcare setup and strong institutional arrangements are both crucial for the design and implementation of strategies to undermine the adverse consequences of dual practice.Political stability and administrators/executives are all important in implementing the policies and innovations implementing the policies and innovations in all fields of the social life. [25]


## CONCLUSION

All studies have adequately portrayed the overall state of professionalism in healthcare; public's concern about it and suggested appropriate measures for its reversal.Since the practitioners, particularly the dual job holders, are the key persons in this regards, their involvement as study participants in all such studies seems essential.None but only one study [12] identifies dual job holding healthcare practitioners as its study participants wherein main focus of interview has been on their motivation for dual job and NOT on attitude, role of education and internal motivation in attitude building and their perspective on making policies to regulate such practices.Same is true where policy measures regulating dual job [8,9,18,21,26,35] and public-private partnership or coalition [35] are discussed.

Moreover, educational aspects of professionalism [23,24] and lack of a holistic view of the picture because it is the combined perspectives of practitioners, educators, administrators & executives, politicians and the society that is required to address the issues of declining professionalism and its corrective measures appear to be the significant gaps in the studies reviewed.Most of the reviews originate from and the studies have been conducted in USA/Canada and Europe [1,8,9,11,12,[19][20][21]23,24,26,35] which do not represent the low income and resource limited contexts. [10,18,22] Hnce they are limited in their scope.

Synthesis and interpretation of the results in this review is likely to have been influenced by the researcher's own experience of being a dual job practitioner, his regular interaction with the public about moralities and his knowledge of divine teachings of Holy Qur'an.


## RECOMMENDATIONS

Foregoing in view, it is suggested that qualitative studies exploring perceptions of doctors with dual jobs as health care professionals about the practices of professionalism in both public and private sector along with their views about factors leading to such a state and their proposals for improvement in a low income and resource limited settings should be done and continued.
