SURVEY OF RECENT LITERATURE 377 SURVEY OF RECENT LITERATURE The Old Testament



The two volumes in memory of President Harper contain twenty-six papers contributed by American scholars and covering a considerable part of the Old Testament field-a fitting tribute to President Harper's activity as a teacher of the Old Testament.

Gilbert's popular sketch of the history of interpretation contains some good observations on the limitations which an uncritical treatment of the Old Testament puts upon exegesis itself.-The Italian reply to the Encyclical of Pius X, translated into English by Father Tyrrell, and published under the title, The Programme of Modernism, has a short but lucid sketch of the recent results of Old Testament criticism.-A calm and well-considered view of the critical situation is given in Knight's "Criticism and the Old Testament."-The three Gould Prize Essays furnish facts about Roman Catholic translation work not generally known to Protestant readers. The comparison made between the versions is intelligent and fair. The arrangement of the material is not so clear as it might be, and the attitude toward the Apocrypha is to be regretted. An excellent bibliography is appended.

The fifth edition of Professor ComiU's "Einleitung" has been translated into English in part and published thus under the title "Introduction to the Canonical Books of the Old Testament." The English edition, as the title indicates, omits the part of the German work relating to the Apocrypha; this was done at the author's request-the Apocrypha is to be treated in a separate (German) volume by Professor Gunkel. CornilPs work agrees in general in method and results with Driver's well-known Introduction, differing from it partly in being less statistical in form, and partly in taking a more advanced position in regard to the date and origin of certain portions of the Old Testament. It may be recommended as an excellent guide in the study of the Old Hebrew literary history.

Canon Cheyne, in his "Traditions and Beliefs," cites a large mass of suggestive material from Babylonian and other records and from folk-lore; but the value of his construction of this material is diminished by the nature of the theories to which he has lately committed himself.-Alongside of this work may be mentioned Oordon's "Early Traditions of Genesis," a conservative survey of the field.

A convenient edition of the Bible is Taylor's " Ancient Hebrew Literature," which in four volumes gives the Old Testament, the Apocrypha, and the New Testament, the matter being arranged by topics. The second volume of Professor Briggs's " Psalms" completes his work on the Psalter. This volume, like the first (which has been widely noticed in critical journals), contains a wealth of exegetical and critical material with much helpful reflection. Dr. Briggs here reaffirms his position respecting the dates of the psalms, the methods of the editors, and the nature of the metrical forms; the subject is a difficult one, and there is room for difference of opinion on many of the points involved.

In the Introduction to his " Ecclesiastes " Professor Barton gives a thoughtful criticism of the various views of this somewhat enigmatical book that have lately been expressed. In general he has avoided the extreme positions of some recent scholars; his own position may be described as liberal conservative. In agreement with Noldeke and McNeile he assigns the book to about the year 200 B.C., on the ground that it is quoted in Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus), the date of which is about 180 B.C. He recognizes interpolations by only two editors, the one orthodox, who corrects the author's heresies, the other a sage who is devoted to wisdom. He rejects the view that the book is affected by Greek thought and that it is metrical in form; the alleged Epicureanism of 9 7-9 he finds in a Babylonian fragment of about 2000 B.C. These positions, all of them debatable, are defended with marked ability. The commentary is clear and helpful. It is satisfactory to see that he retains the Masoretic text of the first clause of chap. 12 ("Remember thy creator in the days of thy youth"), which, however, he properly regards as an editorial interpolation. Dr. A. W. Stream's "Esther" has useful annotations; its critical position is unduly conservative. In Anthropological Essays, a collection of papers presented to Dr. E. B. Tylor in honor of his seventy-fifth birthday, Dr. J. G. Frazer, in a paper entitled "Folk-lore in the Old Testament," discusses a number of passages with great learning and freshness, though his conclusions are not in all cases satisfactory.-Customs and ideas in the Orient are persistent, and the description of manners given by Grant in his "Peasantry of Palestine" helps to reconstruct the old Hebrew life.

Professor Montgomery's "Samaritans" gives the best account of the history and religious opinions of this people that has yet been published. The part of the book relating to Old Testament times deals with the facts in accordance with sound methods of historical investigation. The Samaritans are said to have been substantially a Jewish sect; Sanballat is regarded (against Josephus) as a contemporary of Nehemiah; and Isaiah 66 is not interpreted as a reference to the Samaritan temple.

Dr. M. A. Meyer's "Gaza" is a valuable contribution to our historical material. It substantially reproduces Stark, and adds the results of recent investigations.-Rev. David Gregg's popular sketch of the interbiblical history is useful, though critically vague.

It cannot be said that Professor Toffteen has advanced our knowledge of the early Hebrew history by the discussions in his "Chronology"; his bold conjectures are without historical support. The treatment of Old Testament chronology, however, occupies only a small part of the volume. An instructive comparison of the Old Testament religion with other religions is given in Professor Bousset's " What is Religion ? " an attractively written book.-"The Religion of the Old Testament" is the translation of Professor K. Marti's well-known work on the subject; he is sometimes over-conservative, but always full and suggestive.-Professor Workman's "Servant of Jehovah" is a scholarly and helpful study of a question that has perpetual interest for students of the Old Testament.-An admirable guide in the study of Hebrew law is Kent's "Israel's Laws and Legal Precedents." The material is arranged in general chronological order, with foot-notes and a critical introduction.

In his "Biblical Dogmatics" Professor Terry treats the Old Testament as an independent book and lets it speak for itself, not attempting to import into it New Testament ideas. He dis-cards the terms "inerrancy" and "infallibility" (for the Bible teaching) as contrary to fact, but maintains the " sufficiency" of the Scriptures as a guide to the knowledge of God. The Old Testament he regards as standing in general on a lower ethical and religious plane than that of the New Testament; it is to be regarded, he holds, as an incomplete revelation, a preparation for the full truth of the Christian Scriptures. He frankly adopts modern critical principles and results in the treatment of the Old Testament. The volume is characterized by a clear arrangement of the material and a refreshing directness in the statement and interpretation of the Biblical texts.

C. H. TOT. Hastings's Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels is intended as an aid to preachers, and besides the usual archaeological, critical, and theological articles on subjects connected with the Gospels, " every aspect of modern life, in so far as it touches or is touched by Christ, is described under its proper title," in an enormous number of brief articles, such as " Abiding," " Above and Below," "Accommodation," "Poet," "Fact and Theory." Many of the articles are good and suggestive, and such short discussions of fragmentary topics may prove valuable to many persons. Some of the longer articles also are excellent, but for purposes of serious
