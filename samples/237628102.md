## Results


Barrier: Injecting insulin means my diabetes has become much worse; diabetes has progressed; my diabetes is at an end stage Insulin therapy represents personal failure as a result of inadequate self-management; injecting insulin is punishment Fear/anxiety of injecting with a needle and/or fear of the pain associated with injecting Injecting insulin is overwhelming; not capable of handling the daily demands of injecting insulin; (low self-efficacy concerning the skills needed for IT) Adults with T2D; receiving a new electronic prescription for insulin; participating in the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Injecting insulin will have a negative impact on my day-to-day activities; IT is inconvenient; loss of personal freedom; makes life less flexible; will restrict my life Fearful/worried/ concerned/ anxious about low blood glucose levels associated with injecting insulin (hypoglycaemia)Worried/ concerned/ anxious/fearful that insulin therapy causes weight gain(% of participants who
