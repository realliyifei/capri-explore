ANTICOAGULANTS AND ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY : A REVIEW



The treatment of thromboembolic disease with anticoagulant drugs is based on modern conceptions of the process of coagulation and thrombosis, and is made possible by the availability of certain substances suitable for clinical use which interfere with this process. Much has been done to lnvestigate the effect of these substances 011 experimentally induced thromboembolic states in animals, and numerous reports of clinical trials of anticoagulants in medical and surgical thromboembolic states are now available.

Control of this treatment depends 011 laboratory Assessment of the effect of the drug on the coagulation mechanism, and the closest cooperation between the clinic and the laboratory is essential t? avoid complications and to ensure that the full benefits of the treatment ^5 available to the patient. Present address: Department of Clinical Pathology, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. It is the purpose here to review these various aspects of anticoagulant therapy and to discuss the various factors which we consider to be of importance in the practical management of this form of treatment.

Coagulation and thrombosis. The state of the blood within a blood vessel is influenced by the health of the vessel wall, the state of the circulation, and the coagulability of the blood. Alteration in the' vascular endothelium is the primary cause of thrombosis. How this alteration in the vascular endothelium precipitates the process of intravascular coagulation is uncertain. It is believed by some that the adhesion of platelets resulting from the abnormal vascular endothelium sets in motion an interaction of these platelets with a factor in the plasma (thromboplastinogen? Quick, 1951) resulting in the formation of thromboplastin (Fig. I). As a result of this local reaction, a cycle of events, autocatalytic in nature, leads to a rapidly cumulative, almost explosive, reaction which causes spread oi the thrombosis. This chain reaction is catalyzed by thrombin (Stefanini, Fig. 1. An outline of the coagulation mechanism. The method by which thrombin hastens the production of thromboplastin is uncertain. 1951). Thus the appearance of a small amount of thrombin by the mechanism outlined in Fig. 1 results in the rapid formation of a large amount of thrombin. If the circulation is brisk the thrombotic process will be limited by dilution and rapid removal of thrombin, which is swept away in the blood stream and neutralized by antithrombin. If circulatory stasis allows the autocatalytic action of thrombin to proceed unimpeded, thrombosis will occur.

The available anticoagulant drugs are important in relation to the inhibition of the autocatalytic action of thrombin, some by direct antagonism to thrombin and others by quantitative reduction of the precursors of thrombin formation. Their administration in circumstances conducive to the development of thrombosis must be regarded only as an attempt to influence the balance of power between coagulant and anticoagulant factors, as far as possible in favour of the latter. Since it is usually impossible to influence the degree of vascular damage and circulatory stasis, the maximum effect of anticoagulant therapy consistent with the avoidance of serious therapeutic hazard must always be produced.

Available anticoagulants. There are two main groups of anticoagulant drugs, (1) the heparin group?heparin, paritol, dextran sulphates, and (-) the group of those drugs which reduce prothrombin activity? dicoumarol, tromexan, phenylindanedione, Link compound ' 63 ' and ethvlidene dicoumarin. Only three of these are readily available and require detailed consideration?heparin, dicoumarol and tromexan.

HEPARIN GROUP OF DRUGS.

Heparin. Heparin is a naturally occurring anticoagulant which is exceedingly active in vivo. The physiological function of heparin is uncertain, for it ls seldom found naturally in the blood stream, the natural antithronibin activity of plasma being a different entity. It is uncertain how heparin interferes with the normal coagulation mechanism. In the presence of a plasma co-factor heparin and thrombin form a reversible combination 111 which thrombin is inactivated. Probably heparin also interferes with j-he conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (Jorpes,11)4(5). A reduction 111 platelet adhesiveness is also reported (Moolten ct al., 1949). In virtue its action on thrombin, heparin will break the autocatalvtic cycle. It is probable that heparin, in the purest form available, consists net a single chemical entity, but of a mixture of mueoitin polysulphuric esters. Heparin is prepared usually from lung or liver. It is strongly acidic and its great affinity for proteins adds to the difficulties in its Preparation and purification. Heparin suitable for clinical use is therefore expensive.

Dosage and methods of administration. Heparin is inactive when given orally. The most important disadvantage of heparin is that it must be given intravenously or intramuscularly. A recent report that satisfactory results can be obtained by sublingual administration (Litwins et al., 1951) has not been confirmed (Kennedy & Brown, 1952). In this country heparin is available for parenteral administration in concentrations of 500-25,000 units per ml. Concentrated aqueous heparin (25,000 units per ml.) is intended for intramuscular injection. A preparation of heparin in Pitkin's menstruum (gelatin, glucose, acetic acid, water) intended to prolong the action of the drug is also available for intramuscular use.

In Britain heparin concentration and dosage are usually expressed ui units whereas in American and Scandinavian literature dosage has frequently been expressed in milligrammes. It must be appreciated that heparin is not a pure, homogeneous substance, and that there is no constant relationship between weight and activity. The latter has to be assayed by biological methods. In this country and in America I mg. is usually approximately equal to 100 International units, whereas in Scandinavian countries less potent preparations (80 I.U./mg.) have been in general use.

The recent inclusion of heparin sodium in the U.S.

Pharmacopoeia requires that the potency of any preparation be expressed in units, and that a minimum activity of 100 units per mg. be guaranteed.

In the administration of heparin the aim is to prolong the coagulation time to approximately twice or three times normal. A single dose of 10,000 units given intravenously will show an almost immediate effect, and a response of therapeutic value may persist for 3-4 hours. Larger single doses cannot be employed to prolong the effect, and for a sustained action frequent venepuncture is required. This difficulty can be met to some extent by administration by continuous infusion and it is possible, by means of polythene tubing, to provide uninterrupted heparin administration for several days with little disturbance to the patient.

The effect of intramuscular administration of heparin is unpredictable, and this method of administration should be adopted only when it is not possible to give the drug intravenously. The usual dose of concentrated aqueous heparin intramuscularly is 25,000 units. Under favourable conditions a satisfactory response may last 8-12 hours, and thus at best, the dose must be repeated twice daily. The dose of heparin in Pitkin s menstruum is usually 20,000 to 40,000 units. A satisfactory effect may last 12-18 hours, and the injection has to be repeated at least once daily-

The reports by earlier workers of very prolonged effects were undulv optimistic and have not been confirmed. Intramuscular administration of heparin frequently produces pain at the site of injection. When the pain is immediate the addition of a local anaesthetic may be helpful and this does not interfere with the action of the heparin. Unfortunately repeated administration may cause bleeding into the tissues at the site I'lMt of injection. In such cases the only remedy is to abandon intramuscular treatment.

It would seem that heparin is only of limited use in the treatment of thromboembolic disease. It may be difficult to maintain an adequate effect by intramuscular administration even if the patient can tolerate the frequent injections. The more troublesome and yet more reliable method of administration, by the intravenous route, is obviously unsuitable for maintaining a prolonged coagulation time more or less consistently throughout a period which may extend to several weeks. It must be admitted, however, that there are clinicians who believe that satisfactory therapeutic results can be achieved by heparin administration which falls short of the ideal. This aspect of treatment will be dealt with when clinical evidence of the value of anticoagulant therapy is considered.

Dextran sulphates. Heparin consists of glucuronic acid and glucosamine, some of the hydroxyl groups of which are esterified with sulphuric acid. A feature which has long been recognized is the relationship between the presence ?f the acidic sulphate groups and anticoagulant activity. Numerous examples of sulphuric esters of polysaccharides with heparin-like activity have been described in the literature, but the activity has been too slight or the toxicity too great for therapeutic purposes. Thus ' Paritol,' a polysulphuric ester of alginic acid, was found to have an anticoagulant activity about one tenth that of heparin. Repeated intravenous doses of Paritol ' have been given for periods up to eight days with a satisfactory effect on coagulation. Unfortunately, alarming side effects were reported (Sorenson & Wright, 1949.

Complex polysaccharides or dextrans are produced by microbiological activity, and, in particular, great interest has been recently shown in the dextrans produced from sucrose by Leuconosotoc mesenteroicies. During Jts growth this organism produces an exoeellular enzyme which polyuieri/.es the glucose portion of sucrose to form dextran. 1 )extran has been widely used as a substitute for blood plasma in transfusions. The natural dextran molecules are enormous and quite unsuitable for this Purpose. Reduction of their size is effected by partial hydrolysis. Thereafter, a fractionation process allows graduation of molecular sizes and niakes possible the selection of a sample containing the desired distribution ?f molecular size (Ricketts et al., 1950 ;Rieketts, 1951).

In common with other polysaccharide sulphuric esters, dextran sulphates have a heparin-like activity. Investigations by Walton (1951) showed that the toxicity of these substances is related to their molecular Weight, and that when the starting material (dextran) is below a certain molecular weight, the sulphuric ester prepared from it is no more toxic than heparin itself in experimental animals. Thus as the molecular weight increases above about 20,000 so does the toxicity increase, due to precipitation of fibrin and to platelet agglutination. On the other hand the small molecular weight dextran sulphates were found, like heparin, to be free from these undesirable effects and, on assay, one batch of dextran sulphate was found to possess a heparin-like activity of 17-20 units/mg. This material was found to be effective by parenteral injection only. Dextran sulphate further resembles heparin in giving a marked metachromatic reaction with toluidine blue in vitro, in probably acting in virtue of a strong electro negative charge on its acidic groups (it is opposed by strongly basic substances such as protamine) and in requiring the presence of a plasma co-factor. In the presence of this co-factor its action is that of an antithrombin (Walton, 1951). Ricketts (1952) confirms the relation of toxicity of molecular size and reports that maximum anticoagulant activity is attained when the number of sulphate groups exceeds an average of 1.3 per glucose unit.

Although the fundamental importance of these recent advances can scarcely be over-rated, the practical importance in anticoagulant therapy remains to be assessed. The preparation of a safe synthetic analogue of heparin appears to have been achieved, but no report of clinical trial of suitable dextran sulphates is yet available, and so far there is no indication of the maximum potency which can be expected of the new preparation.


## DRUGS INFLUENCING THE PROTHROMBIN ACTIVITY OF THE BLOOD.

The identification of the causative agent of ' sweet clover disease ' in cattle with dicouumarol in 1940 by Link and his associates (Link, 1943-44) led to the clinical test of dicoumarol in thromboembolic states in man.

Since the preliminary report by Butt et al. (1941) there has been a widespread interest in the pharmacology of the coumarin derivatives. Dicoumarol has been more extensively used for therapeutic purposes than any other related substance but its several disadvantages have led more recently to a search for more rapidly acting and more rapidly excreted substances with a similar effect 011 prothrombin activity. From the search have emerged the Link compound 03, phenylindanedioiie, tromexan and ethvlidene dicoumarin.

At present dicoumarol and tromexan are the only anticoagulants of the coumarin group which are available for general use in this country and therefore they alone will be considered in detail.

Dicoumarol and tromexan.

Given by mouth dicoumarol,methylenebis?(4-hydroxycoumarin), is slowly and erratically absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and thereafter the drug is slowly metabolized to unknown transformation products (Weiner ct al., 1950). For each subject there is a threshold plasma level which must be reached before a detectable prothrombin response is elicited. This is generally between 0.5 and 1.0 mg. per cent.

There is considerably lag between maximal plasma level and maximal prothrombin response and no close relationship exists between the plasma dicoumarol level and the effect on prothrombin activity in different subjects. Troniexan, or 13,3' carboxylenebis (4-hydroxycoumarinyl) ethyl acetate is a coumarin derivative. The acid of this compound was first described by Overman ct al. (1944) and the ethyl ester (troniexan) prepared by Rosicky (1944). Subsequently Reinis and Kubik (1948), von Kaulla and Pulver (1948), Burt ct al. (1941)), Burke and Wright (1950), and Stirling and Hunter (1951), reported on clinical tests with tromexan.

From this evidence tromexan appears to have about one sixth the potency of dicoumarin and a very favourable potency/toxicity ratio.

Hypoprothrombinaemia is induced more rapidly than with dicoumarol and more rapid catabolism reduces the tendency to cumulative effect and allows more rapid recovery when treatment is discontinued.

The action of dicoumarol has been investigated a great deal more thoroughly than that of the other coumarin derivatives. Thus, although the effects of all these derivatives may be fundamentally similar, it would unjustified to assume that this is so on the inadequate evidence which ls at present available.

the site of action. The characteristic feature of ' sweet clover disease ' is haemorrhage resulting from reduced prothrombin activity of the blood (Roderick, 19131). Dicoumarol has been shown to be the substance ^sponsible for this change (Link, 1943-44). The exact nature of its action ls unknown. The experiments of Lupton (1947) have shown that after dicourmarol is administered to rats, the prothrombin activity of blood Perfused through the liver is not increased, whereas similar perfusion of file liver of untreated rats is associated with a rise in the prothrombin activity of the perfusion fluid. It may therefore be assumed that the action oi dicoumarin on prothrombin is secondary to its action on the li\ er. There is a considerable amount of less direct evidence that this is so. dicoumarin is active whether given orally or intravenously : its effect is enhanced in the presence of any factor which might be expected to reduce hepatic efficiency particularly as regards prothrombin formation.

A species and individual variation in the effect of dicoumarol may be Referable to the amount of the drug and its duration of stay, in the liver, -'-his has emerged from the experiments of Lee et al. (1950) using dicoumarol labelled with radioactive carbon. The drug was given intravenously to mice and rabbits. Activity disappeared rapidly from the blood and was identified in the liver, bile, intestinal contents, and later 111 the urine. It was demonstrated that about 10 per cent of the activity became fixed in the liver, and that this activity was due to unchanged dicoumarol. This dicoumarol remained fixed in the mouse liver for 1G hours, and in the rabbit liver for !) days. The corresponding duration of hypoprothrombinaemia was 4 days and 9 days. It was suggested that the period of time that dicoumarol remains in the liver is related to its effectiveness in interfering with the formation of prothrombin.

Mechanism of action. The structural resemblance of dicoumarol to vitamin K led to the suggestion (Woolley, 1947) that dicoumarol acts by competitive interference with the action of vitamin K ; that because of some structural similarity to vitamin K, dicoumarol might replace this substance in some enzyme system involved in the formation of prothrombin. Direct proof of the hypothesis has not been presented but some indirect support is available. There is some similarity between the effects of vitamin K deprivation and the dicoumarol effect: animals already deprived of vitamin K even although they do not already exhibit hypoprothronibinaemia are unduly sensitive to the action of dicoumarol. Administration of certain vitamin K preparations, notably vitamin Ki or its oxide, is able to prevent or reverse the effect of dicoumarol. On the other hand, the similarity between the effects of vitamin K deprivation and the dicoumarol effect is not complete (Dam & Sondergaard, 1948 ;Mann et al., 1950). There is evidence that the activity of coumarin derivatives is not strictly related to their chemical similarity to vitamin K (Jensen & Jensen, 1942). It appears also that small amounts of dicoumarol are biologically antagonistic to disproportionately large increases in vitamin K intake (Overman et al., 1942 ;Glavind & Jensen, 1944).

Furthermore, although both vitamin K deprivation and dicoumarol administration may be associated with impaired prothrombin production, it appears from recent work that dicoumarol plasma lacks also a factor which accelerates the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (Hurn et al., 1947 ;Owen & Bollman, 1948 ;MacMillan, 1948 ;Mawson, 1949 ;Alexander et al., 1949 ;Owen et al., 1951 ;Koller et al., 1951 ; Owren & Aas, 1951).

Compound 63. Link compound 63, chemically related to dicoumarol, was fir6*synthesized in 1942 (Ikawa et al., 1944). Initial clinical observations on this compound were made by Battle et al. (1950) who demonstrated that a single dose of 2 mg. per kg. body weight was capable of producing adequate reduction in prothrombin activity within 24 to 48 hours. '1 he results of more extensive trials have been described by Brambel d al- (1950), by Allen and Hill (1951), by Hanson et al. (1951), by Rotter and Meyer (1951), and by Barker et al. (1952). Compound 63 appears to have an advantage over dicoumarol in the earlier appearance of therapeutic ' prothrombin levels ' and in the ease of maintenance of these values with a relatively fixed dose of the anticoagulant. It is more potent than dicoumarol and does not appear to be any more toxic, or less effective in clinical use.

Phenylindanedione. In 1947 Meunier et al. drew attention to the drug phenylindanedione which showed a transitory effect on the prothrombin time. This effect is associated with a more rapid return of the prothrombin time to normal than occurs after dicoumarol (Meunier et al., 1947 ;Gueguen & Soulier, 1948 ;Jacques et al., 1950). Furthermore, although single doses of phenylindanedione had only a slight effect on the prothrombin time, administration of this drug at frequent intervals resulted in an activity against the prothrombin time as great as that of dicoumarol . Trials of phenylindanedione in the human subject suggest that the effect is more uniform, the response more rapid, and the recovery more immediate than when dicoumarol is used (Bjerkelund, 1950 ;Blaustein, 1950 ;Blaustein et al., 1950). Although phenylindanedione has certain advantages over dicoumarol, it has not been subjected to extensive clinical trial and its place in anticoagulant therapy remains to be explored.


## Ethylidcne diconmarin.

This substance is a coumarin derivative?!3,3'-ethylidene-bis (4 hydroxycoumarin)?which has a slow onset in depression of prothrombin activity, being similar in this respect to dicoumarol itself; there is thereafter a more rapid return to normal. A favourable clinical trial of this drug is reported by Rose and Kriger (1951). experimental use of anticoagulants in thromboembolic STATES. Best et al. (1938) showed that administration of a large dose of purified heparin prevents or delays the formation of white thrombus in glass cells 0r cellophane tubes interposed between the carotid artery and the jugular yein. Adequate heparinization prevents the rapid occlusion of glass eannulae interposed between the cut ends of a large artery (Murray & Janes, 1940). Observations on small peripheral arteries in exposed dog mesentery showed that the blood cells began to form sludge 10-20 minutes after the portal or superior mesenteric vein was clamped. Heparin administered in clinically safe but effective doses did not prevent sludge formation, but it did prevent thrombosis and adhesion of sludged masses ot cells to the vessel wall (Lauffman et al., 11)48). Administration of heparin will permit resolution of the obstruction at least in the early sludge stage (Loewe et al., 1948). This is probably the explanation for the of the thrombus and stimulates collateral bypassing of a thrombotic obstruction, and also the view that recanalization of thrombus may be aided by such anticoagulant treatment . Investigations have shown that administration of heparin will prevent the formation of coronary arterial and cardiac mural thrombi when sodium ricinoleate is injected or infiltrated into the coronary arteries or into the myocardium (Solandt & Best, 1938 ;Solandt et al., 1939). Venous damage, produced by physical or chemical means produced thrombosis in 80-85 per cent of experiments ; administration of heparin reduced the incidence of thrombosis to about 20 per cent (Murray et al., 1937).

Experimental work with dicoumarol has shown that this substance also can be used effectively against thrombosis, which is markedly inhibited in the presence of full dicoumarol effect (Allen et al., 1942 ;Thill et al., 1943). The patency of glass cannulae inserted in the course of an artery is maintained by the dicoumarol effect as by heparin (Bollman & Preston, 1942). Similar conclusions regarding the effectiveness of dicoumarol have been reached by various other experimental trials (Richards & Cortell, 1942 ;Dale & Jaques, 1942 ;Kieswetter & Shumacker, 1948). The only criticism of the significance of these experiments comes from a surgical unit by Rogers et al. (1949) who regarded the dosage of dicoumarol as excessive, and report that prothrombin levels of 10-30 per cent of normal were insufficient to reduce the incidence of thrombosis in traumatized veins in their experiments. It is perhaps true that the experimental anticoagulant therapy was sometimes more intensive than would be used clinically, but it is also true that the trauma applied to the veins by Rogers et al. (1949) was greater than that used by most other workers. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that previous reports showed only that under certain circumstances anticoagulant therapy had some inhibitory effect on a tendency to thrombosis and thereby justified extension of the anticoagulant trials to human thromboembolic disease. Important from the therapeutic aspect is the evidence that administration of dicoumarol does not retard the healing process or the development of collateral circulation in dogs with experimentally induced myocardial infarction (Blumgart ct al., 1948 ;LeRoy & Nalefski, 1948). This has been confirmed in human studies (Wright,194(5). Kubik and  concluded that adequate therapy with coumarin compounds is beneficial in promoting recanalization of arteries and veins occluded by thrombi produced experimentally in rabbits.


## CIJNICAL, USE OF ANTICOAGULANTS.

Surgical thromboembolic states. Available information compiled from large scale surveys in many centres (Wright, 1949) indicates clearly that among post-operative patients who develop venous thrombosis and are treated by conventional methods, there is a minimal risk, amounting to about 50 per cent, of pulmonary embolism. This complication carries an average mortality of 20 per cent. It appears also that after hysterectomy the anticipated risk of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is about 0.0 per cent and the risk of fatal pulmonary embolism is about 0.06 per cent (Allen et at., 1947). The risk of fatal pulmonary embolism in general surgical cases has been estimated at the same level (Allen & Donaldson, 1948). Furthermore among 809 selected surgical cases (chiefly abdominal) 68 (8.5%) had definite signs, and 54 (6.8%) uncertain but suggestive evidence, of thrombosis (Crafoord, 1941).

It has been shown that anticoagulant therapy can reduce the incidence, m cases of thrombophlebitis, of subsequent embolism from the anticipated 25 per cent to 2.8 per cent and of fatal pulmonary embolism from 5.7 per cent to zero . Complete absence of thromboembolic complications was reported by Crafoord (1941) in a series of 325 surgical patients to whom heparin was administered prophylacticallv. The majority of the patients had undergone an abdominal operation, and Were over 40 years of age. In a control series of 302 patients, the majority in a younger age group, there occurred 33 certain instances of thrombosis.

In 125 patients with venous thromboembolic disease, of whom 42 had pulmonary embolic episodes before heparin treatment was begun, there were only four deaths (Loewe et al., 1946). These authors also indicate they have not seen pulmonary embolism occur in the presence of adequate heparin treatment. Bauer (1946a) shares the views of Leowe al-(1946) regarding the rapid disappearance of symptoms in peripheral venous thrombosis treated with heparin and reports reduction in mortality in such cases to 10 per cent of previous figures. The length of stay in bed xvas reduced from about 40 days to less than 5 days, and incapacitating after-effects were seldom seen.

Medical thro mho embolic states.

Pulmonary embolism is not uncommon in medical patients and, from Published accounts, may be actually more common than in post-operative Cases. In a post-mortem study of 370 cases of pulmonary embolism, 40 per cent were post-operative and the remaining 60 per cent occurred in Medical patients, approximately half of whom had cardiac disease (Hampton & Castleman, 11)40). Bauer (1946b) found that, of 804 cases ?f thrombosis 56 per cent came from medical wards. Carlotti et al. (1947), 111 a ten year survey from the Massachusetts General Hospital, observed that the mean incidence of pulmonary embolism or infarction was 0.6 per cent of medical admissions and 0.24 per cent of surgical admissions, thus o.'},4 per cent of all cases of pulmonary embolism occurred in medical Patients. The great majority of these (85%) occurred in patients over years of age.

It is a common belief that pulmonary emboli, occurring in patients with cardiac disease, arise from the right side of the heart. This is in spite of the frequent failure to demonstrate residual clot in this region at autopsy. In post-mortem investigation of 90 cases of pulmonary embolism, 56 of which showed rheumatic heart disease or evidence of recent or previous myocardial infarction, only 12 showed mural thrombi in the right side of the heart, and over 75 per cent of those in whom the leg veins were examined showed thrombosis in these vessels (Carlotti et al., 1947).

Embolic complications from the left side of the heart are common in myocardial infarction, and the thrombotic complications of this disease rank high among the causes of death. Their presence at autopsy has been assessed as varying from 9.9 per cent (Mintz & Katz, 1947) to 45 per cent (Hellerstein & Martin, 1947) (see also Conner & Holt, 1930 ;Blumer, 1937 ; Nay & Barnes, 1945). These figures include emboli from sources other than the heart.

Mural thrombus itself is found in 17-83 per cent of autopsies in myocardial infarction (Blumer, 1937 ;Falk, 1942 ; Nay & Barnes, 1945).

The effect of anticoagulant therapy has proved as beneficial in medical as in surgical thromboembolic disease. The excellent results of prophylactic and therapeutic administration of heparin or dicoumarol to cases of thrombophlebitis have already been mentioned. Such conditions are not confined to post-operative patients and indeed may occur more often in medical wards than is realised.

The treatment of myocardial infarction with anticoagulants has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Early reports of encouraging results (Wright, 1946 ;Nichol & Page, 1946 ;Peters et al., 1946) led to a large scale investigation by the American Heart Association (Wright et al., 1948). This investigation revealed that anticoagulant therapy was associated with a mortality rate of 15 per cent as against 24 per cent in a comparable control group. Thromboembolic complications were much reduced by treatment and final analysis indicated that only (j per cent developed such complications while actually under therapeutic effect of anticoagulant therapy as compared with 25 per cent in the control group. It is not surprising therefore that the greatest benefit was obtained in the reduction of the numbers of those who suffered one or more thromboembolic complication prior to death (10 per cent in the controls to 3 per cent in the treated cases). As might have been anticipated, anticoagulants were less effective in reducing the mortality not directly or indirectly attributable to thromboembolic complication (14 per cent in controls and 12 per cent in treated group). These findings are in agreement with less extensive observations of others (Glueck et al-> 1948 ;Parker & Barker, 1948 ;McCall, 1948 ;Schilling, 1950 ;Tulloch & Gilchrist, 1950). Similar results have been obtained using tromexaii instead of dicoumarol (Tulloch & Gilchrist, 1951). Failure of anticoagulant therapy. In the use of anticoagulant drugs there has been a fear that haemorrhagic complications may be produced. This fear, together with a lack of confidence in the laboratory methods used to control treatment, has resulted in many patients receiving inadequate treatment. This may be one of the explanations of the numerous reports in the literature concerning the failure of anticoagulant therapy to prevent the development of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (Artz et al., 1949 ;Bostrom & Gardell, 1950). It must be remembered, however, that anticoagulant therapy can confer not absolute, but merely relative immunity to thromboembolic disease. Failures are inevitable; they can be reduced to a minimum only by providing the maximum anticoagulant effect which is consistent with avoidance of undue risk of haemorrhage.


## Toxicity of anticoagulants.

Heparin is toxic only in its effect on the coagulation mechanism. Untoward reactions have been described (Duff et al., 1951) but with modern highly refined preparations these are execedingly rare. The incidence of bleeding associated with heparin therapy is less than with dicoumarol and has been assessed at about 1 per cent (Duff et al., 1951). A case of anaphylactic reaction is recorded (Chernoff, 1950).

Dicoumarol and tromexan affect the coagulation mechanism by interfering with liver function ; and this effect may involve substances other than prothrombin. It is now clear, however, that from a practical point of view the effect is confined to factors involved in the coagulation mechanism and that no liver damage is produced by therapeutic, or even larger, doses of dicoumarol (McCarter et al., 1944). Tromexan has a very favourable potency/toxicity ratio (von Kaulla & Pulver, 1948) and with this drug there is at least as wide a margin of safety as with dicoumarol.

Since the earliest experimental observations on dicoumarol it has been observed that there is little relationship between the prothrombin time and the tendency to bleed, unless the duration of treatment be taken into account. Thus rabbits given a single massive dose of dicoumarol exhibited no haemorrhagic tendency in spite of the virtual absence of Prothrombin activity in the plasma (Link, 1943-44). In a recent review it has been concluded that in man there is a greater tendency to haemorrhage when the prothrombin time has been elevated for some days (Hogben & Allen, 1950). Overdosage due to lack of adequate supervision, or to inaccurate laboratory support has been responsible for most of the serious haemorrhagic complications reported. Careful administration of dicoumarol should not produce serious haemorrhagic complications : minor 'deeding can be expected to occur in a small proportion of cases. Thus Allen (1947) describes the occurrencejof minor epistaxis, haematuria, petechiae and ecchymoses in 3.1 per cent of 1,680 cases treated with dicoumarol.

Indications for anticoagulant therapy.

There can be 110 doubt that thromboembolic disease is sufficiently common to be of great practical importance and that the results of anticoagulant therapy in man support the favourable impressions gained from trials in experimental animals.

Numerous attempts have been made to relate an increased clotting tendency to the occurrence of venous thrombosis. It seems unlikely, however, that such a change, even if it were demonstrable, would prove to be a reliable index of a tendency to thrombosis, when the tendency is almost always due to pathological changes in the endothelium in a relatively small portion of the cardiovascular system. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that although there are reports of hyperprothrombinaemia in thromboembolic states (Shapiro, 1944), in coronary and cerebral thrombosis (Hines & Kessler, 1945), in arteriosclerotic patients (Meyers & Poindexter,194(5), and in acute coronary occlusion (Peters et al., 1940 ;Overman & Wright, 1951), there is no general agreement that such changes always occur (c.f. contrary reports by Cotlove & Vorzimer, 1946 ;Tuft & Rosenfield, 1947). Furthermore, even when hypercoagulability is demonstrable its presence cannot be used to indicate which patients are about to develop venous thrombosis (Fowler, 1949).

The indications for anticoagulant therapy must continue to be a matter of clinical judgement. This judgement must be based on a full awareness of the implications of the diagnosis, and on a full appreciation of the advantages and disadvantages of anticoagulant therapy.

Contraindications to anticoagulant therapy. Heparin is widely regarded as a relatively safe anticoagulant. Nevertheless it is a potent drug and it should be used with caution, if at all, in the presence of an actual or potential bleeding lesion and in hepatic or advanced renal disease.

The major contraindication to dicoumarol or tromexan therapy is the presence of disease of the liver, especially if the pre-treatment prothrombin level is already low. In such cases the effect of treatment will be unpredictable, exaggerated, and prolonged beyond the usual. Even minor degrees of liver damage such as may occur in congestive heart failure, may cause undue sensitivity to dicoumarol. In chronic congestive cardiac failure structural changes justifying the term cardiac cirrhosis have been found in as many as 10 per cent of cases (Kotin & Hall, 1951). It is not surprising, therefore, that investigation of the response of patients with congestive heart failure to dicoumarol reveals that many patients may be unduly sensitive to the drug (Stats & Davison, 1949). Renal impairment may be a contributing factor in such cases. Experimental work on dicoumarol showed at an early stage (Bollman & Preston, 1942) that extreme hypoprothrombinaemia resulted from administration of the drug to animals with impaired kidney function. A similar relationship has been found in the human subject. Thus major bleeding has resulted from administration of a single dose of 500 mg. of dicoumarol to a patient with poor renal function (Butler & James, 1950). The prothrombin time was prolonged to more than 2i minutes. An additional factor may contribute to the bleeding in cases of renal failure because, as has been mentioned, much larger doses of dicoumarol have been given without this complication (vStats & Bullowa, 1942;Link, 1943-44;Shumacker et al., 1947). The presence of a potential bleeding lesion such as peptic ulcer calls for additional care in the use of anticoagulants, and the presence of a bleeding lesion or haemorrhagic state whether due to a coagulation defect or to vitamin C deficiencv, is a definite contraindication. Additional care should be exercised when other prothrombopenic agents have been administered, e.g., salicylates, aspirin (Link et al., 1943 ;lank, 1943-44 ;Shapiro et al., 1943). Pregnancy presents a problem to anticoagulant therapy which has not been finally settled. Experimental work suggests that grave results may follow dicoumarol administration during pregnancy (Kraus et al., 1949). On the other hand it would appear that puerperal thrombosis may be treated without undue risk of post partum haemorrhage (Davis & Porter, 1944 ; Barnes & Erwin, 1946) and that infants are not affected by administration of dicoumarol to the cursing mothers (Brambel & Hunter, 1950 ;Brambel et al., 1950). THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS.


## Heparin.

Dosage and methods of administration. Heparin can be administered nitravenously or intramuscularly. If it is technically feasible, the intravenous route is the method of choice.

Intravenous administration of heparin. By the intravenous route, about 5,000-10,000 units of heparin require to be given at intervals of hours if a sustained prolongation of the coagulation time is to be Maintained. It is usually accepted that a useful therapeutic effect is achieved when the coagulation time is 2-3 times the pretreatment value, dosage is regulated by repeated estimation of the coagulation time, and there is little tendency to summation of effect. The practical disadvantages of this method of administration are obvious, but we, in common xvith others, have found that continuous administration of heparin by drip technique through polythene tubing can be efficiently maintained several days with little disturbance to the patient. The use of a Needle with a Gordh diaphragm adapter is favourably reported (Murley, ?950;Wynn et al., 1952). The needle with adapter is inserted either directly into the vein or is attached to polythene tubing which leads to the vein. The intermittent injections of heparin are then made through the diaphragm of the adapter. Intramuscular heparin. The more frequent use of this is limited by variability of response. As previously stated, heparin for this purpose is available in two forms?concentrated aqueous heparin (25,000 units/c.c.) or heparin in Pitkin's menstruum (20,000 units/2 c.c.). We believe that the more generally reliable preparation is the concentrated aqueous heparin. The use of this is also favourably reported by other workers (Stats & Neuhorf, 1947 ;Abrahams, 1950 ;Evans & Finney, 1952). An intramuscular injection of 25,000 I.U. in 1 ml. is given and eight hours later the coagulation time is estimated. If this figure is 20 minutes or more a 12 hourly injection will suffice. If, however, the coagulation time is under 20 minutes, a further dose of 25,000 I.U. is given (Evans & Finney, 1952). Further dosage is similarly evaluated.

Heparin in Pitkin's menstruum though favourably reported by some (I,oewe, 1947 ;Greene & L,oewe, 1947 ;Muir, 1950) has been found disappointing by others (Jorpes et al., 1951 ;Evans & Finney, 1952). The explanation for this probably lies in great individual variation in response with this preparation. Variability in the same patient from day to day is also reported (Goodwin & MacGregor, 1950). An average requirement of this preparation is 20,000-40,000 units 12-hourly depending on the whole-blood clotting time. During the use of intramuscular heparin a summation tendency is observed occasionally. Many Scandinavian clinicians have followed the practice of Crafoord (1941) who gave heparin intravenously in four separate doses daily to post-operative cases, for prophylactic purposes, commencing four hours after operation. In view of the doses given (50+50+ 50+ 100 mg. or 75-4-754-75+125 mg.), and the usual potency of the heparin used (80 units/mg.) it is clear that the effect of treatment must fall short of the ideal as assessed by the prolongation of the coagulation time. Nevertheless, the results have been very satisfactory. Administration of heparin in this way provides almost complete protection against both postoperative and puerperal thromboembolic complications (Murray & Mackenzie, 1939;Crafoord & Jorpes, 1941 ;Iveissner, 1941 ;Wetterdal, 1941). For therapeutic purposes, larger doses are given, the first and last doses being somewhat greater than the others (e.g., 150,75,75,150 nig.)-This is designed to avoid an injection during the night.

In spite of the fact that heparin is a relatively safe and efficient anticoagulant for clinical use, its high cost ((50/-to SO/per day) and the difficulties in its administration limit its use to cases in which the risk of thrombosis is unusually great, such as those in whom venous thrombosis has already occurred, or those who previously have suffered thromboembolic episodes after operation or childbirth. In such patients, heparin treatment when given in the manner adopted by Scandinavian workers, and when used in conjunction with exercise and early ambulation, has been almost invariably successful (Jorpes,194(5).

Control of administration. When heparin is given intravenously in four daily doses of 4,000-12,000 units as described, it is the practice (Bauer, 1946a, b) to dispense with laboratory supervision. There is some justification for this. The dosage referred to above given to an adult will not disturb the coagulation mechanism to a dangerous degree, and by this method of administration no sustained heparin effect is produced and no cumulative effect occurs.

If, however, continuous administration is considered, if large doses are given, or if heparin is given by other routes, it is desirable to control administration by estimation of the coagulation time. The method of Lee and White (1913) is satisfactory for this purpose.

It must be stressed that if any reliance is to be placed on the results of this estimation, careful standardization of the technique is essential.

In our experience there is a widespread impression that the estimation of the coagulation time is a simple procedure which can be carried out by the most junior or uninformed assistant and that no particular precaution need be taken. The coagulation time is only a crude estimate of the efficiency of the coagulation mechanism, but carefully carried out, the test gives useful information. Carelessly performed the test is worthless.

Complications of treatment. Local symptoms may be produced by intraniuscular administration of concentrated aqueous heparin or of heparin in Pitkin's menstruum. Immediate pain can be relieved by local injection of 1-2 c.c. 1 per cent procaine and this does not interfere with the action of the heparin. Haematomata at the site of intramuscular injections are common. In the absence of a potential source of haemorrhage, bleeding as a result of heparin administration is rare, and is seldom serious.

Antidotes to heparin. The strong affinity of heparin for basic substances explains its ready combination with proteins, and also the fact that its action can be neutralized by toluidine blue and by protamine.

Toluidine blue combines with heparin quantitatively (Jaques, 1943) but its action is slow compared with that of protamine. Thus although the dye can be administered in doses of 1-4 mg./kg. given as a 1 per cent solution in isotonic sodium chloride solution (Alien et al., 1047) it is unsuitable for use as an antidote against heparin overdosage.

Protamine sulphate is available commercially, and if given in correct arnount intravenously is effective immediately in neutralizing the activity ?f heparin. It is given intravenously in doses which are regulated by the Magnitude of the heparin dosage and by the lapse of time since the heparin was given. Thus protamine sulphate requires to be given in There is a popular belief that if protamine sulphate alone is not available as an antidote against heparin, protamine zinc insulin is a useful alternative. Indeed, it has been stated that ' Toxic overdosage is best treated by protamine as protamine zinc insulin plus sugar ' (Fergusson, 1946). This is not in accordance with what is known of the substances involved. Dosage and method of administration. An outstanding advantage of dicoumarol and tromexan is that these substances are effective anticoagulants when given by mouth. Although there is some delay before the desired therapeutic effect is produced, this must be accepted as unavoidable as neither increased dosage nor parenteral administration is effective in hastening the anticoagulant effect (Bjerkelund, 1951).

An important feature of this group of drugs is the individual yariation in response to treatment. Although it is customary to assess the initial dose in relation to body weight it must be understood that even in apparently healthy individuals the response to this dose may fall short, or be much in excess, of therapeutic requirements. Patients in advanced age-groups, undernourished patients, and anaemic patients may be sensitive to such anticoagulants. The presence of hypoprothrombinaeinia calls for cautious use of prothrombopenic drugs and the response of individuals with obvious or suspected impairment of liver or kidney function should be carefully assessed by administration of small doses of the anticoagulant.

Administration of an appropriate dose of dicoumarol is followed by a rise in the prothrombin time to a maximum in about 72 hours. It may be 5-7 days before the prothrombin time returns to normal. Dicoumarol may be given daily or alternatively the drug may be given in larger single doses at intervals of 3-5 days, the next dose being given when the daily prothrombin time estimation indicates that the effect of the previous dose is beginning to fall off.

As has been mentioned, haemorrhagic phenomena are more liable to occur with sustained severe hypoprothrombinaemia, and the effect of dicoumarol tends to be cumulative.

On the basis of a single daily estimation it is impossible to be certain of the trend of prothrombin effect when dicoumarol is given each day. Furthermore, the effect of repeated doses of dicoumarol is variable and unpredictable. Thus it may be difficult to maintain safe but effective dicoumarol effect by the maintenance method.

We favour the intermittent method of dicoumarol administration. It is efficient against thromboembolic disease and is less liable to result in complications (Shapiro & Weiner, 1949). By this method the first dose is given in sufficient amount to produce therapeutically effective prolongation of the prothrombin time. This initial dose may be as large as 600-800 nig. No further dicoumarol is given until, as indicated by daily estimations, the prothrombin time has passed its peak and the downward trend has been established. Requirements thereafter are usually less than the initial dose and are given 011 this pattern as long as treatment is required, dosage being regulated individually by the previous response, dicoumarol is available as 50 nag. tablets.

Tromexan differs from dicoumarol in its more rapid action and in the rate at which it is metabolized in the body. The maximal effect is achieved within 24-36 hours and the prothrombin activity of the blood returns to normal in 3-4 days. Intermittent dosage is therefore of no value. On the contrary it is preferable to administer tromexan in divided doses 2-3 times daily. By continuous administration of the drug in this Planner controlled by the daily estimation of the plasma prothrombin activity, the production and maintenance of the therapeutic effect is relatively easy. Tromexan has an advantage over dicoumarol in this respect and in addition owing to its less prolonged effect, it is less liable to cumulative action, and when the drug is discontinued the prothrombin times return to normal more rapidly. On these grounds tromexan is preferable to dicoumarol in the routine treatment of thromboembolic disease.

Tromexan is available in 50 mg. and 300 nig. tablets. It is not the object of this paper to give detailed dosage schedules for every varying condition and circumstance. However, to give some indication of required dosage an average sized individual would be given 1,200 mg. on the first day and thereafter the daily maintenance might vary from 300 mg.-1.800 mg. depending on the prothrombin time. Dosages should be divided throughout the day.

Control of administration. Treatment with dicoumarol or tromexan should not be undertaken in the absence of laboratory support. It is essential that accurate estimation of the prothrombin activity of the plasma be carried out daily during therapeutic administration of these drugs. Some relaxation of the rule may be permitted when patients are under prolonged or prophylactic treatment but such relaxation must be based on prior knowledge built up from a wide experience of anticoagulant therapy and knowledge of the individual's previous response.

The prothrombin one-stage test and expression of results. Although there is evidence that the effect of dicoumarol and tromexan is not simply to cause hypoprothrombinaemia, it is abundantly clear from wide clinical experience that careful estimation of the ' prothrombin time ' provides information which is adequate for the control of treatment. The plasma prothrombin activity lias for long been estimated by a one-stage or a two-stage technique. We do not intend to discuss the relative accuracies or values of these techniques or their modifications. It is sufficient here to say that, in relation to the management of dicoumarol or tromexan administration, the one-stage method is reliable and relatively simple, and that the two-stage method is more troublesome and more timeconsuming without providing any obvious practical advantage. The method we have used during the past few years has given very satisfactory results : details are as follows.

One-stage prothrombin test. Requirements.


## 1.

Water bath at 37?C. 2.

2% potassium oxalate or .'5,S% sodium citrate.


## 3.

M/40 calcium chloride.


## 4.

Thromboplastin ; this is prepared from rabbit or human brain by the method of Quick (1951).

All blood vessels and meninges are stripped from the brain, a piece of which is placed in a mortar and treated with acetone to dehydrate it. The material is kneaded and pressed with the pestle but grinding is avoided at this stage. The brain is extracted with three further changes of acetone and grinding may he used with the third and fourth extractions. At this stage a finely granular suspension should be readily produced. The material is spread 011 a filter paper and placed 011 a Biichner funnel. After washing repeatedly 011 the funnel with acetone the material is dried bv suction and subsequently at 37?C. for 30 minutes. The material is stored in 0.2 g. quantities in vacuumized ampoules. For daily use the contents of one ampoule are mixed with 5 ml. saline and after incubation at f>0?C. for 20 minutes the preparation is placed in the water bath at .'?7?C. and is ready for use.


## Procedure.

Venous blood is collected in a dry paraffined syringe by clean venepuncture. 4.5 ml. of blood are mixed with 0.5 ml. of oxalate or citrate. This is accomplished by the use of a graduated centrifuge tube or other marked test tube, ensuring thorough gentle mixing of blood and anticoagulant.

To 0.2 ml. of plasma in a small tube of standard size is added 0.2 ml. of thromboplastin and after approximately one minute 0.2 ml. of ZVI/40 calcium chloride is rapidly delivered?a stop watcli being started simultaneously. The end point is read by stirring the mixture with a glass rod, drawn out and bent at the end to form a hook which catches the first of fibrin formed. The observation is made m triplicate and the mean taken as the final result. A control must always be estimated at the same time as the test plasma. The test is performed at :57?C. and should be done within a few hours of collection of the specimen.

The estimation of the prothrombin time by the one-stage technique requires considerable attention to detail. A ' clean ' venepuncture is essential to prevent contamination of the blood sample with tissne fluid, and the relative proportions of blood and oxalate solution should be accurately preserved. All glassware must be chemically clean and the test must be carried out with adequate temperature control. The most difficult part of the technique in the past has been to obtain suitable thromboplastin. This probably accounts for the use, even now, of Russell viper venom. There is no justification for this. Russell viper venom should never be used as a thromboplastin in the control of anticoagulant therapy. Its use has been associated with a high incidence of haemorrhagic complications (Ball & Hughes, 1949), and it has been amply demonstrated that the one-stage test using venom alone or venom plus lecithin, gives results which bear little relationship to those obtained using a tissue extract thromboplastin (Biggs & Macfarlane, 1949). To those with laboratory facilities the preparation of a potent thromboplastin from rabbit or human brain should present no difficulties if the instructions are carefully followed (Quick 1951). Some difficulty may at first be experienced in preparing a thromboplastin which will retain its high potency for several months but we have found that this can be achieved if care is taken to exclude air and moisture from the preparation. This is best done by sealing small amounts of the freshly prepared and dried thromboplastin in ampoules in vacuo. For those who have little or no laboratory facilities a preparation of thromboplastin is now available commercially (thrombokinase-Geigy). We have found this material to be less potent than the thromboplastin prepared by ourselves in that it gives normal prothombin times of 20-25 sees, compared to 10-13 sees. Nevertheless the one-stage technique using this commercial preparation ?f thromboplastin has been found to give constant results and reliable information in the control of anticoagulant therapy.

In estimating the prothrombin activity of plasma by the one-stage technique, the results can be expressed in units of time in relation to the known normal. When this method of expressing the results is employed is common practice, in the administration of dicoumarol or tromexan, aim at increasing the ' prothrombin time by a constant factor, ihus if whole plasma is used in the test, the therapeutic aim is to double approximately the prothrombin time. Using acetone-dried human brain thromboplastin this corresponds to approximately 10-15% on a saline dilution curve.

Attempts have been made to relate the prothrombin time to Prothrombin content. It must be understood that there is no linear relationship between these two variables. On the contrary, their relationship can |)e })etter expressed by a hyperbolic curve. Therefore the concentration of prothrombin must be estimated from a calibration curve Prepared by testing samples of normal plasma the prothrombin concentration of which has been artifically reduced. It is common practice reduce the prothrombin content by dilution. Unfortunately, dilution affects all substances present which are concerned in fibrin formation and therefore it is not surprising that reference curves prepared from diluted plasma differ in shape according to the diluent (Conley & Morse, 1948 ;Biggs & Macfarlane, 1949). The curves also vary according to the potency of the thromboplastin used. It will be apparent therefore that if dilution curves are to be used in routine work to assess ' prothrombin concentrations/ they require to be prepared at least daily. Saline is the usual diluent employed and therapy is designed to produce ' prothrombin levels ' of 10-20 per cent of normal.

In routine control of dicoumarol or tromexan therapy we have found both methods to give approximately the same information and therefore, the preparation of dilution curves may be regarded as superfluous. Preparation of these curves, however, is not a tedious or a difficult process (normal plasma should always be tested as a control along with the abnormals whichever method is used) and it provides a measure of security by acting as an additional check 011 the methods.

Complications of treatment. The chief complication of dicoumarol or tromexan treatment is bleeding, and this commonoly presents itself as haematuria, haemoptysis, haematemesis, epistaxis, petechiae, or ecchymoses.

Using dicoumarol under optimal conditions bleeding is of minor degree and relatively uncommon (Allen, 1947). Under similar conditions, the use of tromexan may be even less liable to produce bleeding, so that, in the absence of a potential source of haemorrhage and of the other contraindications previously discussed, the incidence of even minor haemorrhagic complications can be expected to be under 3 per cent. Severe haemorrhage is a rarity and an indication of faulty therapeutic control.

Tromexan has an unpleasant taste and occasionally is associated with nausea and vomiting.

Antidotes to dicoumarol and tromexan. Blood transfusion and the administration of vitamin K preparations are earried out when it is desired to hasten the return of therapeutic hypoprothrombinaemia towards normal.

The first of these is undoubtedly effective, and the blood need not be freshly withdrawn from the donor. The use of lyophil-dried plasma has been favourably reported (Cosgriff et al., 1948). It has been observed by the authors (unpublished observations, 1951) that the improvement in prothrombin level following blood transfusion in a patient stabilized on tromexan is very transient, lasting only a few hours. A similar observation has been made by Stefanini and Pisciotta (1950) working on dicumarolized rabbits. The chief factor involved therefore is quantity-During the past ten years considerable interest has been shown in the effect of vitamin K preparations on dicoumarol-induced hypoprothrombinaemia, and numerous experiments have been carried out both in animals and in the human subject. It cannot be said, however, that there is general agreement regarding either the relative effects of the various vitamin K preparations, or regarding the form of vitamin K activity which is most suitable for the treatment of hypoprothrombinaemic bleeding occurring as the result of the administration of dicoumarol or tromexan. The available information on this aspect of anticoagulant therapy has not so far been reviewed. Since we do not share the widely held view that any vitamin K preparation is suitable as an antidote to the dicoumarol effect and since we believe that our opinion is supported by much of the widely scattered published work, some details of the available evidence will be given here.

The work of Overman et al. (1942a, b) established that in animals vitamin K, administered in adequate dosage, counteracted the effect of dicoumarol. This was not confirmed as occurring in man (Bingham et al., 1941 ;Butt et al., 1941 ;Meyer et al., 1942 ;Lehmann, 1941). On the basis of clinical observations, Shapiro et al. (1943) regarded synthetic vitamin K analogues as unsatisfactory in the treatment of dicoumarolinduced hypoprothombinaemia. They considered that the lack of agreement among earlier workers was due to the relative dosages of the drugs employed, and by clinical experiment found that synthetic vitamin K preparations may be completely effective against only the ' smallest effective quantities ' of dicoumarol. Evidence of effectiveness of these analogues against therapeutic dosage or overdosage of dicoumarol was n?t presented. Lehmann (1942) reported that in two patients showing minor haemorrhage as a result of dicoumarol, these ' were controlled by the administration of 100-200 mg. of 2-methyl-l, 4-napthaquinone disulfate which increased the prothrombin index within 3-12 hours.' No other information is given in this or in a subsequent paper (Lehmann, 1943) in which success with a related water soluble analogue was claimed, but the relative inefficiency of the treatment was suggested by the author s statement that ' skin bruising larger than the palm of the hand should be treated with blood transfusion. ' Townsend and Mills (1942) were cited by  as having reported that a synthetic vitamin K analogue counteracted the hypoprothrombinaemia produced by dicoumarol. Actually these authors did not provide good evidence of the effect of vitamin K and did not claim to have done so. Cromer and Barker (1944) gave menadione bisulphite in doses usually (>4 mg. to patients with excessive hypoprothrombinaemia due to ^icoumarol. A satisfactory response was claimed in all but two patients, but it is very doubtful if such an optimistic view was justified. Two response curves were shown, one illustrating the effect oi menadione ?iven two days after .'{00 mg. dicoumarol (average of (> cases). On the third day the prothrombin time had fallen from about 80 sec. to 35 sec. , lt was still 35 sec. on the fourth day. The second curve showed the average response of six patients given menadione for excessive hypoprothrombinaemia following administration of 300 mg. and 200 mg. dicoumarol on successive days. A prothrombin time of 35 sec. (from 80 sec.) was not recorded until three days after the administration of the vitamin K and the prothrombin time was not normal six days after the vitamin K had been given. Thus although there is evidence that menadione may have modified the dicoumarol effect, its value as an antidote was less evident.

Lack of general agreement as to the ' adequacy ' of an antidote lias resulted in further expressions of satisfaction in regard to the synthetic preparations. Thus Allen and Hull (1951) describe the ' marked effect ' of menadione bisulphite 011 the hypoprothrombinaemia of one patient given dicoumarol and of a second given ' compound 63.' I11 the first of these the prothrombin concentration did not return to above 80 per cent of normal until eight days after the last dose of dicoumarol. In the second it took at least 24 hours for the prothrombin concentration to rise from 10 to 25 per cent after the administration of menadione bisulphite, 6 days after the last dose of ' compound 63.' A further report in favour of the synthetic analogues was made by . These authors reported from hospital records 21 cases given water soluble Synkavit and menadione sodium bisulphite in doses of 72-150 mg. intravenously. Although there is evidence here that these substances had some effect 011 the hypoprothrombinaemic action of dicoumarol, against the author's more enthusiastic conclusions are the very variable results, the great variation in the dicoumarol treatment prior to the administration of the vitamin K preparations, and the inadequacy of the controls. Among the 21 test cases only 4 had dicoumarol on the day before the vitamin K was given, whereas among the 18 ' controls ' 11 received the anticoagulant 011 the selected ' zero ' day, i.e., the day on which the vitamin K might have been given. Among the treated cases, in not one instance did the prothrombin time return to normal under 24 hours. One day after the administration of vitamin K the prothrombin time was still twice normal in 8 and three times normal in 3.

From this evidence it can be said that synthetic vitamin K analogues may modify the effect of dicoumarol. They cannot, however, be regarded as particularly suitable for use in a hypoprothombinaemic emergency following overdosage with dicoumarol.

Most of the differences of opinion regarding the value of vitamin K as an antidote to dicoumarol have been concerned with the synthetic analogues. Vitamin K j and its oxide have been reported by most workers to be highly effective. Davidson and Macdonald (1943b) described three patients in whom hypoprothombinaemia was induced by very large single doses of dicoumarol (0.5-1 g.). These patients were given 200, 350 and 450 mg. vitamin K t oxide intravenously. The prothrombin returned to normal in fourteen hours in one case, in twenty-four hours in a second. The patient given 200 nig. vitamin Kj oxide failed to respond. Lucia and Aggeler (1944) reported a case of excessive hypoprothrombinaemia due to excessive dosage with dicoumarol (192 daily doses of 0.5-1 g.).

Bleeding had occurred for about five days when, three days after the last dose of dicoumarol, 500 mg. vitamin K i oxide was given intravenously.

A marked effect was evident in four hours and haemorrhage had ceased by twenty-four hours. The effect of vitamin K i oxide was again demonstrated against excessive doses of dicoumarol by Davidson et al. (1945), who, however, were concerned chiefly with observation on the coagulation time. James et al. (1949) demonstrated the superiority of vitamin Ki oxide as an antidote to dicoumarol.

Menadione sodium bisulphite (04-180 mg. i.v.), Synkavite (100-500 mg. i.v.) and vitamin Ki oxide (100-2,000 nig. i.v.) were administered in single doses to patients with dicoumarol hypoprothrombinaemia. Vitamin Ki oxide was found to be most effective. Given in doses of 0.5 g. or more a satisfactory result was obtained in an average of thirteen hours.

Six patients with severe hypoprothrombinaemia were given 0.1 g. or more Ki oxide with return of prothrombin levels to a safe range in 4 hours.

A further investigation into the relative merits of the various vitamin K preparations was carried out by Miller et al. (1950). These authors gave dicoumarol over several days to rats, dogs and human subjects. ^ itamin K was given when reasonably stable prothrombin levels had been obtained for three days and dicoumarol was continued without interval after the vitamin IC was given. Under these conditions vitamin Ki and its oxide were effective but menadione, menadione bisulphite and Synkavite were without effect, except in one patient given 00 mg. Menadione bisulphite which seemed to modify the acion of the dicomnarol. Shoshkes et al. (1950) reported the complete blocking effect of vitamin K| 011 dicoumarol-induced hypoprothombinaemia in dogs ; the vitamin Ki NVas given with a special emulsifying agent which appears to ease the problem of intravenous administration. The successful intravenous use ?* vitamin K i in man using this emulsifying agent is now reported (Catkin et al., 1951 ;Itallie ct al., 1952). These emulsions, which do not break down on autoclaving, enable the vitamin K i to be given in small Volume (50 mg. of vitamin Ki per mil.). Hanson et al. (1951) report on the strong and rapid antagonistic effect of orally administered vitamin Kj against the hypoprothrombinaemia produced by Link's Compound 63. From this evidence it would appear that vitamin K i or its oxide is niuch more potent than the water-soluble synthetic analogues, against the hypoprothrombinaemic effect of dicoumarol. \\ ith a view to testing this conclusion and to extending the investigation, the present authors have investigated the effect of several substances with vitamin K activity :i50 on the hypoprothrombinaemic action of dicoumarol and tromexan in the human subject (Douglas & Brown, 1952). In this investigation it was found that although the synthetic vitamin K preparation given in large doses might at times modify the anticoagulant effect of dicoumarol and tromexan, their action in this respect was unreliable and never sufficiently great to justify their use as antidotes in hypoprothrombinaemic emergency. Vitamin K i on the other hand was found to be capable of blocking completely or of reversing within a few hours, the effect of dicoumarol or tromexan.

Ideal treatment of the serious hypoprothrombinaemic emergency resulting from administration of dicoumarol or tromexan is the simultaneous intravenous administration of blood and vitamin K i or its oxide.

Since the latter substances are not at present available commercially in this country, blood transfusion is the only reliable and satisfactory treatment.

Reconstituted lyophilized plasma can be employed as a substitute for blood but, like blood, it has a transitory effect and repeated transfusions may be necessary (Cosgriff et al., 1948). The use of pooled plasma has a further disadvantage in that it introduces a greater risk of homologous serum hepatitis.


## Choice of anticoagulant.

The choice of the anticoagulant depends 011 the immediate needs of the case, on the probable duration of the treatment and 011 other variable factors such as availability of veins, and the presence of some contraindication. When immediate anticoagulant therapy is indicated, when the duration of treatment is likely to be short, and when a minor contraindication is present, heparin is the anticoagulant of choice ; and it should be given intravenously. From the collected evidence, and from our own experience, we favour the method of administration adopted by Scandinavian workers (Crafoord, 1941). Technical aids to intravenous heparin therapy have been discussed. The action of the drug is immediate, it can be given without undue difficulty for a week or more ; and the action can be terminated speedily by stopping treatment, or immediately by the administration of protamine sulphate. Laboratory control is not essential if suitable dosage is employed, as previously described.

If long-term treatment is required the administration of tromexan is recommended. It is effective, it can be given by mouth, and the cost is negligible when compared with that of heparin. If it is desired, the immediate effect of heparin can be combined with tromexan therapy by giving both from the first day and by continuing the heparin for 24-3o hours, until the tromexan effect is apparent. Thereafter, tromexan is given alone. As heparin interferes with the one-stage prothrombin time some clinicians prefer to use tromexan alone from the outset.

In the presence of a major contraindication, anticoagulant therapy should not be attempted. In the presence of a minor contraindication, it is advisable to remember that no thromboembolic disease for which anticoagulant therapy might otherwise be indicated, carries 100 per cent mortality. Apparently minor contraindications may introduce a greater risk than is involved in the withholding of anticoagulant treatment.

## "
Approximately equal amounts (1.0-1.5 mg. protamine for 100 units heparin) if given immediately after the heparin, whereas if there is a time lapse the protamine requirements may be considerably reduced (^arkin & Kvale, 1949; Jaques a/., 1938; Seegers, 1951). The dosage of protamine sulphate should not be excessive as under such circumstances it may have an anticoagulant action of its own (Portmann & Holden, 1949).


Protamine sulphate neutralizes heparin by combining with this substance approximately as mg. with mg. Thus a dose of 10,000 units (about 100 mg.) would require up to 100 mg. of protamine, the actual amount depending on the lapse 01 time, lo provide this amount of protamine, approximately 10,000 units of protamine zinc insulin would require to be given, on the basis that this insulin preparation contains 0.75-1.25 mg. (B.P.C.) and 1.0-1.5 mg. (U.S.P.) protamine for every 100 units of insulin activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirm the exceedingly low antiheparin potency of the insulin preparation (Brown & Kennedy, 1951). Dicoumarol and tromexan.
