We present the discovery of a white dwarf companion to the G1 V star 12 Psc found as part of a Keck adaptive optics imaging survey of long-term accelerating stars from the McDonald Observatory Planet Search Program. Twenty years of precise radial-velocity monitoring of 12 Psc with the Tull Spectrograph at the Harlan J. Smith telescope reveals a moderate radial acceleration (≈10 m s −1 yr −1 ), which together with relative astrometry from Keck/NIRC2 and the astrometric acceleration between Hipparcos and Gaia DR2 yields a dynamical mass of M B = 0.605 +0.021 −0.022 M for 12 Psc B, a semi-major axis of 40 +2 −4 AU, and an eccentricity of 0.84±0.08. We also report an updated orbit fit of the white dwarf companion to the metal-poor (but barium-rich) G9 V dwarf HD 159062 based on new radial velocity observations from the High-Resolution Spectrograph at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and astrometry from Keck/NIRC2. A joint fit of the available relative astrometry, radial velocities, and tangential astrometric acceleration yields a dynamical mass of M B = 0.609 +0.010 −0.011 M for HD 159062 B, a semi-major axis of 60 +5 −7 AU, and preference for circular orbits (e<0.42 at 95% confidence). 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B join a small list of resolved "Sirius-like" benchmark white dwarfs with precise dynamical mass measurements which serve as valuable tests of white dwarf mass-radius cooling models and probes of AGB wind accretion onto their main-sequence companions.

## INTRODUCTION

Dynamical masses represent anchor points of stellar astronomy. Direct mass measurements are important to calibrate models of stellar and substellar evolution, especially during phases in which physical properties change significantly with time-for example throughout the pre-main sequence; along the evolved subgiant and giant branches; and as white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and giant planets cool and fade over time (e.g., Hillenbrand & White 2004;Simon et al. 2019;Konopacky et al. 2010;Bond et al. 2017a;Parsons et al. 2017;Dupuy & Liu 2017;Snellen & Brown 2018;Brandt et al. 2019a). Masses are traditionally determined with absolute astrometry of visual binaries or radial-velocity (RV) monitoring of either eclipsing or visual binaries. Other approaches include modeling Keplerian rotation of resolved protoplanetary disks, gravitational lensing, and transit-timing variations in the case of close-in planets (see Serenelli et al. 2020 for a recent review).

It is especially challenging to measure dynamical masses of non-transiting binaries when one component is faint, as is the case of white dwarf, brown dwarf, or giant planet companions to stars. With high-contrast adaptive optics (AO) imaging, there is a pragmatic trade-off between separation and contrast: short period companions reveal their orbits on faster timescales but are more challenging to detect, whereas more distant companions are easier to image but orbit more slowly. Similarly, RV precision, stellar activity, and time baseline of the observations compete when measuring a radial acceleration induced on the star by the companion. The optimal region in which radial reflex accelerations can be measured and faint companions can be imaged with current facilities is ∼5-100 AU. Most of the known benchmark white dwarf, brown dwarf, and giant planet companions fall in this range of orbital distances (see, e.g., Table 2 of Bowler 2016).

One of the most successful means of identifying these faint "degenerate" companions (whose pressure support predominantly originates from electron degeneracy) with direct imaging has been by using radial accelerations on their host stars, which can act as "dynamical beacons" that betray the presence of a distant companion. Long-baseline RV surveys are especially wellsuited for this task, such as the California Planet Survey (Howard et al. 2010), Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey (Butler et al. 2017), McDonald Observatory Planet Search (Cochran & Hatzes 1993), Lick Planet Search (Fischer et al. 2014), Anglo-Australian Planet Search (Tinney et al. 2001), and CORALIE survey for extrasolar planets (Queloz et al. 2000). With baselines spanning several decades and sample sizes of thousands of targets, these programs have facilitated the discovery and characterization of a growing list of substellar companions (HR 7672 B, Liu et al. 2002;HD 19467 B, Crepp et al. 2014;HD 4747 B, Crepp et al. 2016; HD 4113 C, Cheetham et al. 2018;Gl 758 B, Thalmann et al. 2009HD 13724 B, Rickman et al. 2020;HD 72946 B, Maire et al. 2020;HD 19467 B, Maire et al. 2020;Gl 229 B, Nakajima et al. 1995;Brandt et al. 2019b) and white dwarf companions (Gl 86 B, Els et al. 2001, Mugrauer & Neuhäuser 2005HD 8049 B, Zurlo et al. 2013;HD 114174 B, Crepp et al. 2013;HD 11112 B, Rodigas et al. 2016;HD 169889 B, Crepp et al. 2018;HD 159062 B, Hirsch et al. 2019) with direct imaging. Only a handful of these degenerate companions have dynamically measured masses, although recent efforts to determine astrometric accelerations on their host stars using Hipparcos and Gaia are increasing these numbers (e.g., Calissendorff & Janson 2018;Brandt et al. 2019a;Dupuy et al. 2019).

To find new benchmark companions and measure their dynamical masses, we launched the McDonald Accelerating Stars Survey (MASS), a high-contrast imaging program targeting stars with radial accelerations based on RV planet search programs at McDonald Observatory. The McDonald Observatory Planet Search began in 1987 at the 2.7-m Harlan J. Smith Telescope and is among the oldest radial velocity planet surveys (Cochran & Hatzes 1993). The most recent phase of the survey using the Tull Spectrograph commenced in 1998 and continues today. In addition to discoveries of giant planets spanning orbital periods of a few days to over ten years (e.g., Cochran et al. 1997;Hatzes et al. 2003;Robertson et al. 2012;Endl et al. 2016), many shallow long-term accelerations have been identified over the past three decades. Accelerating stars in our sample also draw from a planet search around 145 metal-poor stars using the 9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope's High-Resolution Spectrograph (HRS). This program operated from 2008 to 2013 and, like the McDonald Observatory Planet Search, identified both planets and longer-term radial accelerations (Cochran & Endl 2008).

In Bowler et al. (2018) we presented an updated orbit and mass measurement of the late-T dwarf Gl 758 B as part of this program based on new imaging data and RVs from McDonald Observatory, Keck Observatory, and the Automated Planet Finder. The mass of Gl 758 B was subsequently refined in Brandt et al. (2019a) by taking into account the proper motion difference between Hipparcos and Gaia. Here we present the discovery and dynamical mass measurement of a faint white dwarf companion to the Sun-like star 12 Psc based on a long-term RV trend of its host star from the McDonald Observatory Planet Search. In addition, we present an updated orbit and mass measurement of HD 159062 B, a white dwarf companion to an accelerating G9 V star recently discovered by Hirsch et al. (2019) and independently identified in our program using radial velocities from HRS. These objects join only a handful of other resolved white dwarf companions with dynamical mass measurements.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide an overview of the properties of 12 Psc and HD 159062. Section 3 describes the RV and imaging observations of these systems from McDonald Observatory and Keck Observatory. The orbit fits and dynamical mass measurements for both companions are detailed in Section 4. Finally, we discuss the implications of the mass measurements for the evolutionary history of the system in Section 5.


## OVERVIEW OF 12 PSC AND HD 159062

12 Psc (=HD 221146, HIP 115951) is a bright (V = 6.9 mag) G1 V dwarf (Gray et al. 2006) located at a parallactic distance of 36.2 ± 0.06 pc (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). Spectroscopy and isochrone fitting imply a slightly more massive, older, and more metal rich analog to the Sun. For example, Soto & Jenkins (2018) find an age of 5.3 +1.1 −1.0 Gyr, a mass of 1.11 ± 0.05 M , a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.13 ± 0.10 dex, and an effective temperature of 5950 ± 50 K. This is in good agreement with other recent analysis from Tsantaki et al. (2013), Marsden et al. (2014), and Aguilera-Gómez et al. (2018). The old age is bolstered by the low activity level, with log R HK values ranging from -5.06 dex to -4.86 dex (e.g., Isaacson & Fischer 2010;Murgas et al. 2013;Saikia et al. 2018). A summary of the physical, photometric, and kinematic properties of 12 Psc can be found in Table 1. HD 159062 is an old, metal-poor, main-sequence G9 V star (Gray et al. 2003) located at a distance of 21.7 pc (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). Hirsch et al. (2019) derive a mass of 0.76 ± 0.03 M using spectroscopicallyderived physical properties and stellar isochrones. A wide range of ages have been determined for HD 159062 in the literature: Isaacson & Fischer (2010) and Hirsch et al. (2019) find activity-based ages of ≈6 Gyr and ≈7 Gyr using R HK values, while typical isochrone-based ages range from 9.2 ± 3.5 Gyr from Luck (2017) Brewer & Carney (2006) also note that HD 159062 exhibits substantially enhanced s-process elements and suggest this could have been caused by mass transfer from an evolved AGB companion. This scenario is supported by Fuhrmann et al. (2017), who find anomalously high barium abundance and conclude that HD 159062 may harbor a white dwarf companion. This prediction was realized with the discovery of HD 159062 B by Hirsch et al. (2019) using a long-baseline RV trend from Keck/HIRES and follow-up adaptive optics imaging. They determine a dynamical mass of 0.65 +0.12 −0.04 M for HD 159062 B, which was refined by Brandt et al. (submitted) (Tull et al. 1995) at McDonald Observatory's 2.7-m Harlan J. Smith telescope between 2001 and 2020. All observations used the 1. 2 slit, re-   sulting in a resolving power of R ≡ λ/∆λ ≈ 60,000. A temperature-stabilized gas cell containing molecular iodine vapor (I 2 ) is mounted in the light path before the slit entrance, enabling precise RV measurements with respect to an iodine-free template following the description in Endl et al. (2000). RVs are subsequently corrected for Earth's barycentric motion as well as the small secular acceleration for 12 Psc (0.000582 m s −1 yr −1 ). The time of observation is corrected to the barycentric dynamical time as observed at the solar system barycenter. Observations starting in 2009 take into account the fluxweighted barycentric correction of each observation using an exposure meter. The RVs are shown in Figure 1 and are listed in Table 2 1 . The median measurement uncertainty is 5.1 m s −1 . 12 Psc shows a constant acceleration away from the Sun with no obvious signs of curvature, indicating that a companion orbits this star with a period substantially longer than the time baseline of the observations (P 20 yr). A linear fit to the McDonald RVs gives a radial acceleration of dv r /dt = 10.60 ± 0.13 m s −1 yr −1 .

12 Psc was also observed with the Hamilton Spectrograph at Lick Observatory as part of the Lick Planet Search (Fischer et al. 2014(Fischer et al. ) between 1998(Fischer et al. and 2012 RVs were obtained with a typical precision of 4.4 m s −1 . A linear fit to the Lick RVs gives a slope of dv r /dt = 9.78 ± 0.15 m s −1 yr −1 (Figure 1). This is slightly shallower than the slope from the McDonald RVs (at the 4σ level), which may indicate modest change in acceleration between the mean epochs of both datasets (2004.0 for Lick and 2009.7 for McDonald).


#### Hobby-Eberly Telescope/High-Resolution

Spectrograph Radial Velocities of HD 159062 HD 159062 was monitored with HRS at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope between 2008 and 2014. HRS is a fiberfed echelle spectrograph located in the basement of the HET (Tull 1998), and is passively (rather than actively) thermally and mechanically stabilized. A temperature controlled I 2 cell is mounted in front of the entrance slit and is used as a reference for RV measurements. 64 high-SNR spectra were acquired with the HET's flexible queue scheduling system (Shetrone et al. 2007) with a resolving power of R≈60,000 between 4110Å and 7875Å. Relative RVs are measured in spectral chunks following  Table 3 is published in its entirety in the machine-readable format. A portion is shown here for guidance regarding its form and content.

the procedure described in Cochran et al. (2003) and Cochran et al. (2004). The median RV uncertainty is 3.4 m s −1 .

The HRS RVs of HD 159062 are shown in Figure 2. We find an acceleration of dv r /dt = -14.1 ± 0.3 m s −1 yr −1 , which is similar to the slope of -13.30 ± 0.12 m s −1 yr −1 from Hirsch et al. (2019) based on 45 Keck/HIRES RVs spanning 2003 to 2019. A slight curvature is seen in the HIRES data; this changing acceleration is not evident in our HRS data, most likely owing to the shorter time baseline compared to the HIRES data. A list of our HRS RVs can be found in Table 3.


### Keck/NIRC2 Adaptive Optics Imaging

We imaged 12 Psc and HD 159062 with the NIRC2 infrared camera in its narrow configuration (9.971 mas pix −1 plate scale; Service et al. 2016) using natural guide star adaptive optics at Keck Observatory (Wizinowich et al. 2000;Wizinowich 2013). 12 Psc was initially targeted as part of this program on 2017 October 10 UT with subsequent observations on 2018 December 24 UT and 2019 July 07 UT. HD 159062 was observed on 2017 October 10 UT and 2019 July 07 UT. For each observation, the star was centered behind the partly transparent 600 mas diameter coronagraph to avoid saturation when reading out the full 10. 2×10. 2 array. Most sequences consist of five coronagraphic ("reconnaissance") images with the H-or K S -band filters to search for readily identifiable long-period stellar or substellar companions. 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B were immediately evident in the raw frames, although it was not clear whether they were faint white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, or background stars at the time of discovery. We also acquired deeper sequences in pupil-tracking mode (or angular differential imaging; Marois et al. 2006) in July 2019 to search for additional companions at smaller separations. These observations consisted of forty 30-second frames; for 12 Psc the total field rotation was 11.6

• and for HD 159062 the total rotation was 16.4

• . On the October 2017 and July 2019 nights we also acquired short unsaturated images immediately following the coronagraphic images to photometrically calibrate the deeper frames. A summary of our observations can be found in Table 4.

We searched the Keck Observatory Archive and found that 12 Psc was also imaged on two separate occasions with NIRC2 in September 2004 and July 2005 (PI: M. Liu) in J and K p bands, respectively. Both sequences consist of coronagraphic images similar to our observations with the host star centered behind the occulting spot. 12 Psc B is visible in both frames, offering a 15-year astrometric baseline to test for common proper motion and measure orbital motion.

Basic data reduction was carried out in the same fashion for all images, which consisted of flat fielding using dome flats, correction for bad pixels and cosmic rays, and correction for geometric field distortion using the solutions derived by Yelda et al. (2010) for observations taken before April 2015 (when the adaptive optics system was realigned) and Service et al. (2016) for images taken after that date. For both distortion solutions, the direction of celestial north was calibrated by tying NIRC2 observations of globular clusters to distortion-corrected stellar positions obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting precision in the north orientation is ≈0.001-0.002 • -much less than the typical measurement uncertainties for AO-based relative astrometry.

Images in each coronagraph sequence are aligned by fitting a 2D elliptical Gaussian to the host star, which is visible behind the partly transparent mask, then shifting each image with sub-pixel precision to a common position. We attempted several approaches to PSF subtraction for each sequence in order to increase the SNR of the companion: subtraction of a scaled median image of the sequence; a conservative implementation of the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI; Lafrenière et al. 2007); an aggressive form of LOCI with a more restrictive angular tolerance parameter; LOCI using 100 images selected in an automated fashion from a NIRC2 reference PSF library comprising >2×10 3 registered coronagraph frames; and optional masking of the companion during PSF subtraction. Details of these methods and the NIRC2 PSF library are described in Bowler et al. (2015a) and Bowler et al. (2015b). We attempted PSF subtraction for the 2004 observations of 12 Psc and the 2017 observations of HD 159062 but strong systematics were present in the residuals. The final processed images we adopt for this study are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Table 4 lists the observations and the adopted PSF subtraction method.

In general, astrometry and relative photometry of point sources measured directly from processed (PSFsubtracted) images can be biased as a result of selfsubtraction and non-uniform field of view rotation. These effects can be especially severe for longer angular differential imaging datasets (e.g., Marois et al. 2010). When possible we use the negative PSF injection approach described in Bowler et al. (2018) to mitigate these biases. This entails adding a PSF with a negative amplitude close to the position of the point source in the raw images, running PSF subtraction at that position, and measuring the RMS of the residuals in a circu-lar aperture. This process is then iteratively repeated by varying the astrometry (ρ and θ) at the sub-pixel level and the flux ratio (simply the amplitude of the negative PSF) using the amoeba algorithm (Nelder & Mead 1965;Press et al. 2007) until the resulting RMS is minimized. This method requires a PSF model; if unsaturated frames of the host star are taken close in time to the ADI sequence (to avoid changes in atmospheric conditions and AO correction), this approach can be used to reliably measure the contrast between the host star and the faint point source. When no unsaturated frames are available, any PSF can be used to measure astrometry (but not relative photometry).

We use this negative PSF injection approach to measure astrometry for the ADI datasets of 12 Psc and HD 159062 taken in July 2019. In both cases, images of 12 Psc without the coronagraph mask are used as the PSF model since unsaturated images of HD 159062 were not taken on July 2019. We also use this approach to measure relative photometry and astrometry of 12 Psc for the October 2017 dataset because unsaturated frames were acquired. Uncertainties in the relative photometry are estimated using the mean of the final ten iterations of the amoeba downhill simplex algorithm as the negative PSF separation, P.A., and amplitude settle in at values that minimize the RMS at the position of the companion. For all other observations, relative astrometry is directly computed from the unprocessed images. Total astrometric uncertainties are derived following Bowler et al. (2018) and incorporate random measurement uncertainties; systematic errors from the distortion solution; uncertainty in the plate scale and north angle; and shear (PSF blurring) caused by field rotation within an exposure. Because the coronagraph mask may introduce an additional uncalibrated source of systematic uncertainty (e.g., Konopacky et al. 2016;Bowler et al. 2018), we conservatively adopt 5 mas and 0.1 • as the floor for separation and position angle uncertainties, respectively. Final values for 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B can be found in Table 4. 2 4. RESULTS Figure 5 shows the expected relative motion of a stationary background source due to the proper and projected parallactic motion of 12 Psc. 12 Psc B is clearly comoving and exhibits significant orbital motion in separation and P.A. A linear fit of the astrometry as a func-12 Psc  Table 4 for details). The position of the host star behind the 600 mas diameter coronagraph (masked out in these images) is marked with an "×". North is up and East is to the left.    Based solely on its brightness (H=15.87 ± 0.16 mag; K S = 15.93 ± 0.2 mag; M H = 13.08 ± 0.16 mag; M K S =13.1 ± 0.2 mag), 12 Psc B could be either a brown dwarf or a white dwarf companion. If it is a brown dwarf, its absolute magnitude would imply a spectral type near the L/T transition and an H-K S color of ≈0.6 mag (Dupuy & Liu 2012). The measured color of 12 Psc B (H-K S =-0.1 ± 0.3 mag) is significantly bluer than this, although the photometric uncertainties are large. To estimate the expected mass of the companion assuming 12 Psc B is a brown dwarf, we use a K Sband bolometric correction from Filippazzo et al. (2015) to infer a luminosity of log L bol /L =-4.61 ± 0.10 dex. Based on the age of the host star (5.3 ± 1.1 Gyr; Soto & Jenkins 2018), substellar evolutionary models imply a mass near the hydrogen burning limit (77.8 ± 1.7 M Jup using the Burrows et al. 1997  the companion mass, enabling us to readily test whether this brown dwarf hypothesis for 12 Psc B is compatible with the measured radial acceleration. Following Torres (1999), the mass of a companion accelerating its host star can be derived by taking the time derivative of the radial velocity equation of a Keplerian orbit. The companion mass (M B ) is related to the system distance (d), the projected separation of the companion (ρ), the instantaneous slope of the radial acceleration (dv r /dt), and the orbital elements (eccentricity e, argument of periastron ω, inclination i, and Keplerian angles related to the true orbital phase-the true anomaly f and eccentric anomaly E) as follows:

Using only the measured RV slope, the companion mass distribution can be constrained with reasonable assumptions about the distributions of (a priori unknown) orbital elements and orbital phase angles projected on the plane of the sky. Here we adopt a uniform distribution for the argument of periastron from 0-2π, uniform eccentricities between 0-1, and an isotropic distribution  Figure 7. Joint constraints on the mass and projected separation of a companion to 12 Psc based only on the measured RV trend (left) and using both the RV trend and the astrometric acceleration (right). The hydrogen burning limit (HBL; ≈75 MJup) and deuterium-burning limit (≈13 MJup) are labeled. Based on the strength of the radial acceleration, the companion would be a brown dwarf or giant planet at close separations of 20 AU; more massive stellar or white dwarf companions are required on wider orbits. When the HGCA acceleration is included, the range of possible masses and separations is more limited. The measured separation and dynamical mass of 12 Psc B (from Section 4.5) is shown with the star. of inclination angles projected on the sky (equivalent to a uniform distribution in cos i). To calculate the orbital phase, a mean anomaly is randomly drawn from 0-2π, an eccentric anomaly is iteratively solved for using the Newton-Raphson method, and a true anomaly is computed using tan(f /2) = ((1 + e)/(1 − e)) tan(E/2). Repeating this process with Monte Carlo draws over a range of projected separations results in a joint probability distribution between the companion mass and separation based on the measured radial acceleration (and conditioned on our assumptions about the distribution of orbital elements). Results for 12 Psc are shown in Figure 7. The measured slope of dv r /dt = 10.60 ± 0.13 m s −1 yr −1 implies that if the companion causing the acceleration was a brown dwarf or giant planet, it must be located at 0. 6 ( 20 AU). Assuming the RV trend originates entirely from the imaged companion we identify at 1. 6, the minimum mass of 12 Psc B is 0.49 M . This immediately rules out the brown dwarf scenario. It also rules out any possibility that the companion could be a low mass star because the faintest absolute magnitude this mass threshold corresponds to is M K S ≈ 5.7 mag following the empirical calibrations from Mann et al. (2019). This is about 10 magnitudes brighter than the observed absolute magnitude, implying that 12 Psc B must be a white dwarf.


### The Nature of HD 159062 B

Following the same procedure as for 12 Psc, we show the joint mass-separation distribution for HD 159062 in Figure 8 based on our measured RV trend of dv r /dt = -14.1 ± 0.3 m s −1 yr −1 . This radial acceleration is only consistent with a brown dwarf or giant planet if the companion is located at a separation of 0. 9 ( 20 AU); beyond this it must be a low-mass star or a white dwarf. At a separation of 2. 7, the minimum mass implied by the radial acceleration is 0.67 M . However, Equation 1 assumes that the projected separation ρ and slope dv r /dt are measured simultaneously. The mean epoch of our RV measurements is 2011.5, which is significantly earlier than our imaging observations. The closest astrometric epoch to that date from Hirsch et al. (2019) is 2012.481, at which point HD 159062 B was located at 2. 594 ± 0. 014. In Section 4.1 we found that HD 159062 B is moving away from its host at a rate of 13.8 mas yr −1 . If we correct for that average motion over the course of one year and assume a separation of 2. 580 ± 0. 014 in mid-2011, the minimum mass becomes 0.612 ± 0.015 M , which takes into account uncertainties in the RV trend, distance, and projected separation. 


### Hipparcos-Gaia Accelerations

Brandt (2018) carried out a cross calibration between the Hipparcos and Gaia astrometric datasets which resulted in the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA). Linking these catalogs to a common reference frame (that of Gaia DR2) provides a way to correct for local sky-dependent systematics present the Hipparcos. As a result, measurements of astrometric accelerations between these two missions (separated by ≈25 years) can be inferred through changes in proper motion. The HGCA has been an especially valuable tool to measure dynamical masses of long-period substellar companions by combining absolute accelerations with relative astrometry and radial velocities (Brandt et al. 2019a;Dupuy et al. 2019;Brandt et al. 2019b;Franson et al., in prep.).

Both 12 Psc and HD 159062 have significant astrometric accelerations in HGCA (Figure 9). Three proper motions in R.A. and Dec. are available in this catalog: the proper motion in Hipparcos with a mean epoch of 1991.25, the proper motion in Gaia with a mean epoch of 2015.5, and the scaled positional difference between Hipparcos and Gaia. The latter measurement is the most precise as a result of the long baseline between the two missions.

We compute astrometric accelerations in R.A. (dµ α /dt) and Dec. (dµ δ /dt) using the proper motion from Gaia and the inferred proper motion from the scaled Hipparcos-Gaia positional difference following Brandt et al. (2019a): dµ α /dt = 2 ∆µ α,Gaia−HG / (t α,Gaia − t α,Hip ) and dµ δ /dt = 2 ∆µ δ,Gaia−HG / (t δ,Gaia − t δ,Hip ). Here t α,Gaia and t δ,Gaia are the Gaia astrometric epochs corresponding to the proper motion measurements in R.A. and Dec., and t α,Hip and t δ,Hip are the corresponding epochs for Hipparcos. The total acceleration is then computed as dµ αδ /dt = (dµ α /dt) 2 + (dµ δ /dt) 2 . Brandt et al. (2019a) presented a simple relationship between the mass of a companion (M B ), its instantaneous projected separation (ρ), and both the radial (dv r /dt) and astrometric (dµ αδ /dt) accelerations induced on its host star. In convenient units this can be expressed as
M B M Jup = 5.599 × 10 −3 d pc 2 ρ 2 dµ αδ /dt m s −1 yr −1 2 + dv r /dt m s −1 yr −1 2 3/2 dµ αδ /dt m s −1 yr −1 −2 .
(2)

The numerical coefficient becomes 5.342 × 10 −6 when M B is in units of M . Equation 2 is valid when all three measurements (ρ, dv r /dt, and dµ αδ /dt) are obtained simultaneously. This is rarely the case in practice, but this relation offers a convenient approximation of the dynamical mass as long as the orbit has not evolved substantially, as is the case for long-period companions.

The HGCA kinematics for 12 Psc are listed in Table 1 and displayed in Figure 9. 12 Psc shows a significant change in proper motion between the Hipparcos-Gaia scaled positional difference and Gaia measurements: ∆µ α,Gaia−HG = 0.78 ± 0.12 mas yr −1 and ∆µ δ,Gaia−HG = 1.42 ± 0.09 mas yr −1 . This translates into an astrometric acceleration of dµ αδ /dt = 22.9 ± 1.4 m s −1 yr −1 -about twice as large as its radial acceleration. The inferred constraints on the companion mass and separation resulting from these radial and astrometric accelerations are shown in Figure 7. The projected separation of 12 Psc ranges from 1. 723 in 2004 to 1. 592 in 2019. Using a projected separation of ρ=1. 7, which is closer to the mid-points of the radial and astrometric accelerations, Equation 2 implies a mass of about 0.622 ± 0.018 M . This is typical of white dwarf masses (e.g., Kepler et al. 2007).

HD 159062 also shows substantial changes in proper motion in the HGCA (Figure 9): ∆µ α,Gaia−HG = -2.66 ± 0.12 mas yr −1 and ∆µ δ,Gaia−HG = 1.35 ± 0.11 mas yr −1 . This translates into an astrometric acceleration of dµ αδ /dt = 25.0 ± 1.0 m s −1 yr −1 . Figure 8 shows constraints combining this with the RV trend. At a separation of 2. 580 ± 0.014 mas, the implied mass HD 159062 B is 0.632 ± 0.014 M -in good agreement with the dynamical mass. Below we carry out a full orbit fit of 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B using relative astrometry, radial velocities, and absolute astrometry from the HGCA.


### Orbit and Dynamical Mass of 12 Psc B

The orbit and dynamical mass of 12 Psc B are determined using the efficient orbit fitting package orvara (Brandt et al., submitted), which jointly fits Keplerian orbits to radial velocities, relative astrometry of resolved companions, and absolute astrometry from HGCA. The code relies on a Bayesian framework with the emcee affine-invariant implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) to sample posterior distributions of orbital elements, physical parameters of the host and companion, and nuisance parameters like stellar parallax, instrument-dependent RV offsets, and RV jitter. We use 100 walkers with 10 5 steps for our orbit fit of the 12 Psc system.

Our priors are chosen to ensure the observations drive the resulting posteriors. We adopt log-flat priors for the semi-major axis, companion mass, and RV jitter; a sin i distribution for inclination; and linearly uniform priors for all other fitted parameters ( √ e sin ω, √ e cos ω, longitude of ascending node, and longitude at a reference epoch). A Gaussian prior with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.2 M is chosen for the primary mass based on independent estimates from the literature (e.g. 1.11 ± 0.05 M , Soto & Jenkins (2018); 1.079 ± a Maximum a posteriori probability.

b Mean longitude at the reference epoch, 2455197.5 JD. −38 yr, and a semi-major axis of 39.5 +2.8 −3.5 AU. The dynamical mass of 12 Psc B is 0.605 +0.021 −0.022 M , which is similar to our mass estimate in Section 4.4 using simplifying assumptions. A summary of prior and posterior distributions for relevant fitted parameters can be found in Table 5.


### Orbit and Dynamical Mass of HD 159062 B

We fit a Keplerian orbit using orvara jointly to our HRS RVs, our new NIRC2 astrometry, and the HGCA acceleration for HD 159062 together with HIRES RVs and relative astrometry from Hirsch et al. (2019). The same priors we used for 12 Psc B in Section 4.5 are adopted for HD 159062 B except for the host star mass. Results of the orbit fit are shown in Figures 12 and 13, and a summary of the posterior distributions is listed in Table 6. The dynamical mass of HD 159062 B is 0.609 +0.010 −0.011 M , which happens to be very similar to the mass we found for 12 Psc B. HD 159062 B orbits with a semi-major axis of 60 +5 −7 AU, a period of 390 ± 70 yr, and a low eccentricity which peaks at e=0.0 and is below e=0.42 with 95% confidence. These are consistent with but more precise than the values found by Hirsch et al. 2019 and Brandt et al. (submitted).

Our dynamical mass of 0.609 +0.010 −0.011 M is somewhat lower than the value of 0.65 +0.12  12 Psc Figure 10.

## DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Stars with masses 8 M evolve to become white dwarfs on timescales of a few tens of Myr for highmass stars near the threshold for core-collapse supernovae (e.g., Ekstrom et al. 2012;Burrows 2013) to ∼10 4 Gyr for the lowest-mass stars near the hydrogenburning limit (Laughlin et al. 1997). Given the 13.8 Gyr age of the universe, the lowest-mass stars that can have evolved in isolation to become white dwarfs have masses of ≈0.9-1 M . White dwarf masses generally increase with progenitor mass, and the corresponding minimum white dwarf mass that can result from isolated evolution of such a star at solar metallicity is 0.56 M (Cummings et al. 2018). Most white dwarfs should therefore have masses above this value, and indeed the peak of the white dwarf mass function in the solar neighborhood is ≈0.6 M (e.g., Liebert et al. 2005;Kepler et al. 2007). The majority of these have hydrogen atmospheres with DA classifications (Kepler et al. 2007).

The initial-to-final mass relation connects a progenitor star's mass to the final mass of the resulting white dwarf remnant. These relations are sensitive to metallicity and the physics of AGB evolution, including shell burning, dedge-up events, and mass loss (e.g., Marigo & Girardi 2007). Cummings et al. (2018) provide a semiempirical calibration of the white dwarf initial-to-final mass relation spanning initial masses of ≈0.9-7 M , or final masses between ≈0.5-1.2 M . Using this relation, our dynamical mass measurements for the white dwarfs 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B imply nearly identical initial progenitor masses of 1.5 ± 0.6 M for both companions. The large uncertainties reflect the significant scatter in the empirically calibrated initial-to-final mass relation, which is sparsely populated for initial masses 2.5 M . Theoretical stellar evolutionary models also exhibit substantial dispersion in the initial-to-final mass relation, with initial masses predicted to be between ≈1.3-2.2 M at solar metallicity for the final masses we measure for 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B (e.g., Marigo & Girardi 2007;Choi et al. 2016). The 12 Psc system was therefore initially a ∼1.5 M + 1.1 M binary and the HD 159062 system was initially a ∼1.5 M + 0.8 M binary. The more massive components then underwent standard evolution through the giant and AGB phases. At this point, after about 2.9 Gyr of evolution, their radii expanded to ∼450 R (∼2.1 AU) before shedding ≈60% of their initial mass to become white dwarfs (Paxton et al. 2010;Choi et al. 2016;Dotter 2016;Cummings et al. (2018)). Adopting an age of 5.3 ± 1.1 Gyr for 12 Psc from Soto & Jenkins (2018), the most likely companion progenitor mass of ∼1.5 M implies that the cooling age of 12 Psc B is ∼2-3 Gyr. A higher (lower) progenitor mass would result in a longer (shorter) cooling age. The age of HD 159062 is somewhat more uncertain, but for a system age of ∼9-13 Gyr, a main-sequence lifetime of ≈3 Gyr for the progenitor of HD 159062 B implies a cooling time of a Maximum a posteriori probability.

∼6-10 Gyr for the white dwarf. This is consistent with the cooling age of 8.2 +0.3 −0.5 Gyr derived by Hirsch et al. (2019).

Despite both binaries having broadly similar physical characteristics, it is interesting to note the differences in the orbits of these companions. 12 Psc B has a high eccentricity of e=0.84±0.08 and a semi-major axis of 40 +2 −4 AU, which takes it to a periastron distance of 6.4 AU (with a 68% credible interval spanning 2.7-10.2 AU). On the other hand, HD 159062 B has a low eccentricity most consistent with a circular orbit (e<0.42 at 95% confidence), a semi-major axis of 60 +5 −7 AU, and a periastron distance of 56 +8 −7 AU. Given the orbital properties of 12 Psc B, tidal interactions during the AGB phase should have been important for this system. Without other mechanisms to increase eccentricities, these interactions tend to dampen eccentricities and reduce orbital periods (e.g., Saladino & Pols 2019). Bonačić Marinović et al. (2008) highlight Sirius as an example of a binary which began as a ∼2.1+5.5 M pair which should have circularized, but Sirius B now orbits with an eccentricity of e=0.59 and an orbital period of 50 yr. Assuming a mass ratio of q=M 1 /M 2 ∼1.4 for the unevolved 12 Psc system, the Roche lobe for the 12 Psc B progenitor would have been ≈2.6 AU at periastron following the approximation for the Roche lobe effective radius from Eggleton (1983). This is comparable to the size of 12 Psc B during the AGB phase (∼2.1 AU). Mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow may therefore have occurred in this system, and tidal interactions would have been important. Like the Sirius system, the high eccentricity of 12 Psc B is therefore surprising and lends support to an eccentricity pumping mechanism, perhaps through enhanced mass loss at periastron which may counteract tidal circularization (Bonačić Marinović et al. 2008).

Wide companions will evolve as if in isolation whereas short-period systems will evolve through one of several channels as detached, semi-detached, or contact binaries. 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B occupy an intermediate regime at several tens of AU where direct mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow may not have occurred, but wind accretion could have been important as a source of chemical enrichment of the unevolved companion as each progenitor underwent mass loss. This is especially true for HD 159062, which shows enhanced abundance of barium and other s-process elements-a signpost of prior accretion from an AGB companion (e.g., McClure et al. 1980;Escorza et al. 2019  [Nd/Fe] = -0.09 ± 0.03 dex. This lack of enrichment is surprising when compared to HD 159062: both have white dwarf companions with similar masses and presumably similar evolutionary pathways for their progenitors, but 12 Psc B is on a highly eccentric orbit which brings it much closer to its unevolved main-sequence companion at periastron (≈6 AU for 12 Psc B versus ≈56 AU for HD 159062 B). Given that most barium stars have companions with orbital periods 10 4 days (e.g., McClure et al. 1980), that would naturally lead to the expectation that 12 Psc should be even more questions for the 12 Psc system: Why was 12 Psc B not tidally circularized during the AGB phase? Why is 12 Psc unenriched in barium and s-process elements?

The chemical peculiarities of some barium stars have been attributed to winds from former AGB companions (now white dwarfs) on orbits out to several thousand AU (De Mello & da Silva 1997). It remains unclear why some stars with white dwarf companions at moderate separations appear to have normal abundances while others show various patterns of enrichment. The answer may involve convection and dissipation of material from the host star, the amount of mass lost from the AGB companion, or perhaps a third evolved (and now engulfed) companion in the system. 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B join a small but growing list of directly imaged white dwarf companions orbiting main-sequence stars with measured dynamical masses. To our knowledge, only seven systems with resolved white dwarf companions and precise dynamical mass measurements are known (including 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B; see compilation in Table 7). These "Sirius-like" benchmark systems are valuable because they can be directly characterized with photometry and spectroscopy-yielding an effective temperature, bolometric luminosity, radius, and spectral classificationand the total system age and progenitor metallicity can be determined from the host star. These combined with a mass measurement provide fundamental tests of white dwarf mass-radius relations and cooling models (e.g., Bond et al. 2017b;Bond et al. 2017a;Serenelli et al. 2020). Follow-up spectroscopy and multi-wavelength photometry of 12 Psc B and HD 159062 B are needed to better characterize these companions and carry out robust tests of cooling models.

Because the mass of white dwarf remnants scales strongly with progenitor mass, a lower final mass implies a substantially lower initial mass (and longer mainsequence lifetime) compared to the 2.4 M progenitor mass found byHirsch et al. 2019. The implications of a lower progenitor mass are discussed in more detail below.

Note that the measured RVs are determined with respect to a dense set of iodine absorption lines rather than an absolute reference, such as a stable RV standard. The zero point is therefore arbitrary.
Note that position angles in this work correspond to the angle from celestial north through east at the epoch of observation, not for J2000.
Note that the parameter values for orbit fits quoted in this study represent the median of the parameter posterior distributions and the 68.3% credible interval, although we also list the best-fit values and the maximum a posteriori probabilities in Table 5.
