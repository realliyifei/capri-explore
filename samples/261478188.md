Successful lumbal sympathetic block as an alternative therapy for improving Buerger's disease: A rare case report and literature review
1 September 20230F4E8268175D8B79D5B3F33AE7049E3210.1016/j.ijscr.2023.108778Received 8 August 2023; Received in revised form 29 August 2023; Accepted 30 August 2023Buerger's disease Lumbal sympathetic block Alternative therapy Rare case report
Introduction and importance: Buerger's disease is an inflammation of blood vessels that is strongly related to smoking habits.Lumbal sympathetic block is one kind of lumbal sympathectomy intervention that is used to manage chronic pain, including Buerger's disease.In this case report, we present the case of a Buerger's disease patient treated with a lumbal sympathetic block procedure.Case presentation: A 63-year-old male was referred to our emergency room with chronic pain and ulcers on his left foot.He had already undergone two debridement procedures at his previous hospital without any improvement.After a comprehensive assessment, our cardio-thoracic specialist chose to refer the patient to undergo the lumbal sympathetic block with the orthopaedic specialist.After two procedures, we found a reduction in pain (VAS 6-7 to 2-3), the skin looked more colored, and the patient's walking distance improved from 10 to 100 m without any complaints.We also found good wound healing of the ulcers in his left foot; they became smaller and dryer.Clinical discussion: Lumbal sympathetic block is thought to be able to reduce peripheral retention that causes the opening of an arteriovenous anastomose, thus increasing blood flow to skin tissue and leading to vasodilatation.It showed its capability to prevent Buerger's disease progression, reduce patient complaints, and heal the wound.Conclusion: Lumbal sympathetic block should be considered as an alternative therapy for Buerger's disease.

## Introduction

Non-atherosclerothic inflammation affecting the blood vessel segments that induce ischemia (either an artery or vein) in the hands or feet is known as Buerger's disease or thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) [1,2].It is strongly related to smoking habits [1,2].According to a study, tobacco extract causes hypersensitivity, disrupts peripheral-endotheliumdependent vasorelaxation, increases cellular sensitivity to type I and II collagens, and raises anti-endothelial cell antibody titers [3].On the other hand, the role of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA), i.e., HLA-A9, HLA-A54, and HLA-B5, was found in pathophysiology [3].Patients with Buerger's disease have a high rate of limb loss and amputation [4].Various surgical and non-surgical procedures have been found, but the results are frequently inconsistent, controversial, and unsatisfactory, especially to prevent disease progression [4,5].In this case report, we used lumbal sympathetic block as an alternative procedure to treat and avoid early amputation in a Buerger's disease patient.This study is reported in accordance with SCARE 2020 guidelines [6].


## Case presentation

A 63-year-old male was referred with chronic pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 6-7 out of 10) and lesions on the left foot for the past 2 months, which began as a small pimple but soon grew and was accompanied by pus.He also felt numbness in his left foot after walking at least 10 m.He was a smoker for more than 30 years.The patient initially went to a Type C hospital and underwent two debridement procedures, but neither the lesion nor the pain improved.The vital signs were normal, and no other abnormalities were found.The left foot was pale and had two wounds on it, according to a localized examination.First, on the plantar pedis was found an undermining wound with necrotic tissue, uneven edges, and muscle as the base; the wound size was 4 × 2 × 1 cm, accompanied by pus; and the second one was on the anterior ankle region, with a similar type of wound and a size of 5 × 3 × 1 cm (Fig. 1).

The patient consulted a cardio-thoracic specialist with chronic limb ischemia on the left foot and planned to undergo the blood vessel bypass, but first a CT angiography was performed to confirm the diagnosis.The angiography revealed a thrombus and an entire obstruction of the proximal left iliaca communis artery (bifurcatio) (Fig. 2).The patient was diagnosed with Buerger's disease based on Shionoya and Olin's criteria.Our cardio-thoracic specialist canceled the bypass plans because there was no target artery and chose to refer the patient to our orthopaedic specialist for a lumbal sympathetic block procedure.The aim of this procedure is to repair peripheral vascularization through vasodilatation as an alternative to open lumbal sympathectomy or perlaparoscopy.Cilostazol 2 × 100 mg tab, Dorner 3 × 20 μg tab, Amlodipine 1 × 2.5 mg tab, Paracetamol 4 × 1000 mg tab, Codein 3 × 20 mg tab, Aspilet 1 × 80 mg tab, and wound toilet with NaCl 0.9 % and Gentamycin are given as the initial therapies.

This procedure started with a small incision on the left lumbal area at the level of L3, followed by a needle insertion with C-arm guiding.The next step was the injection of a contrast agent until the sympathetic bundle was visualized.It used Bupivacain HCl (2.5 cm 3 ) diluted with Aqua Bidest (7.5 cm 3 ) as the anesthesia agent.Similar steps were done to the left lumbal area at the level of L4 (Fig. 3).The procedure was done successfully with no significant difficulties.

Post-procedure, the VAS was reduced to 4-5 out of 10, and there was a warm sensation on his left foot.The same procedure was repeated one month later.After two procedures, we found the VAS had decreased to 2-3 out of 10, the skin tone looked normal, and the patient could walk 100 m without complaining about pain or numbness.The plantar pedis wound was dry with granulation and scar tissue; the size was 3 × 1.2 × 0.3 cm without pus, and the other one was almost recovered completely (just the scar tissue remained) with a size of 1.5 × 1 cm (Fig. 4).


## Discussion

The first to describe it was Von Winiwarter in 1879, although Leo Buerger merely published the comprehensive pathology in 1908 [2].Buerger's disease is closely associated with a history of chronic smoking [1,2].Predisposition factors include male gender, infectious agents, anxiety, stress, and lower socioeconomic status [1,2].The highest incidence is found in the Middle East, Korea, Japan, and Israeli Jews of Ashkenazi descent, and it is less common in North America and Western Europe [3].The diagnosis was made based on Shionoya and Olin's criteria [1,7].For Shionoya, our patient had a smoking habit, infrapopliteal arterial occlusion, phlebitis migrans symptoms, and no other atherosclerotic risk factor other than smoking, whereas for Olin, besides the history of smoking, the patient complained about claudication and resting pain, and he also had two ulcers on his left foot.All of the patient's examinations were consistent with the CT angiography results [1,7].

Some procedures have been tried to treat Buerger's disease but have failed to show a good result.Revascularization is not a feasible procedure because the distal blood vessels frequently get involved, thus leaving no more vascular targets [2,3].The use of calcium channel blockers, anticoagulants, thrombolytic agents, prostaglandin analogs, and others has limited effect in reducing pain and avoiding the amputation procedure [2].In this case, we tried to use lumbal sympathetic block as an alternative procedure, although until now there has been no clear guidance about it.Nesargikar et al. conducted a survey using a questionnaire with 242 specialists, resulting in 75 % of respondents feeling that lumbal chemical sympathectomy has benefits for the management of peripheral vascular disease; 80 % of the respondents did it for pain management; and 27 % did it for ulcer management [8].Kothari believed that the benefits of sympathectomy could be judged based on logic and its benefits [9,10].

Our patient felt a significant reduction in pain after the first procedure and even better after the second.Respondents underwent the lumbal sympathetic block procedure periodically in a trial (similar to another one), and it was found that the VAS improved significantly following each block [1,5].According to Cheng et al.'s hypothesis that a sympathetic nerve block can reduce pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy, the significant improvement in blood vessel circulation and the effect could last until 2-4 months each time a nerve block was performed [5,11].

Both the patient's skin tone and walking distance have significantly improved.Concurred with Singh et al.'s study, in which the patient's walking distance increased and significant differences were also obtained, even after the procedure was repeated [5].In another study, there was a claudication distance improvement from 20 m to 500 m after the procedure [1].Igakari et al. observed endothelial function and factors affecting it in Buerger's disease patients who received conservative therapy compared to patients who underwent lumbar sympathectomy [12].It showed a significant correlation between the Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) and the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) in patients undergoing lumbar sympathectomy.This result showed that it is true that lumbar sympathectomy improves sympathetic nerve disorders [12].

In an observation on Buerger's patient who did not show improvement with conservative therapy, the ulcer's diameter was also reduced from 3.5 cm before the block, then became smaller (0.5 cm) and dryer every time the block was done [1].Similar to our patient, another study discovered a process of wound healing in the gangrene of the limbs affected by Buerger's disease [5].The sympathetic nerve ganglia in the lumbar area that innervate the lower limbs are located along the anterolateral spine as high as L2-L4 [13].The intention of the neurolysis is to produce a suppressive effect on vasomotor tone and reduce the pain signal from the afferent nerve [13].This might explain why most patients experience hyperemia after undergoing neurolysis [13].Lumbal Sympathetic Block is thought to be able to reduce peripheral retention that causes the opening of an arteriovenous anastomose, thus increasing blood flow to skin tissue and leading to vasodilatation [1].In addition, there is also an improvement in tissue oxygenation due to a decrease in sympathetic tone, which allows for better wound healing processes [1,14,15].


## Conclusion

We believe this is the first non-invasive procedure for such a case reported in Indonesia.Lumbal sympathetic block exhibits a number of benefits, particularly in improving outcomes in Buerger's disease.It has been shown to reduce chronic pain experienced by patients, including resting pain, increasing the patient's walking ability, and even helping the wound healing process.
