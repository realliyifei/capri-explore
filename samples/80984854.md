## PURPOSE

The growing demand and range of cosmetic procedures, and the recently increased minimum aesthetic surgery requirements set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, highlight the importance of aesthetic surgery experience for plastic surgery residents. However, several program directors have described the challenge of providing sufficient exposure to cosmetic surgery in the teaching hospital setting. 1 Resident-directed aesthetic surgery clinics have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, and the majority of residency programs are associated with a resident clinic. 1 The authors sought to evaluate the current state of aesthetic resident clinics by conducting a comprehensive survey of plastic surgery training programs in the country.


## METHODS

A survey examining specific aspects of aesthetic chief resident clinics was distributed to 70 plastic surgery resident program directors in the United States, focusing on clinic structure, procedures performed, services offered, and financial cost to the patient. Surveys were administered in a single mailing via the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons listserv of all program directors. Responses were collected through September of 2017.


## RESULTS

Fifty-two questionnaires were returned, representing 74.2% of programs surveyed. Thirty-two (63%) reported hav-ing a dedicated chief resident clinic. Most programs (n = 23) indicated they schedule resident clinic once per week, whereas very few programs do so more often (n = 2). Twenty-seven programs reported seeing 1-5 new aesthetic consults per clinic day, and only 2 see more than 10. To attract new patients, most aesthetic clinics advertise for their services (n = 28). However, word of mouth was considered the main way patients became aware of the clinic (n = 29). The 3 most common procedures performed were abdominoplasty (n = 20), breast augmentation (n = 19), and liposuction (n = 16). Regarding the availability of noninvasive procedures, most clinics offer neuromodulators (n = 29) and injectable fillers (n = 29).

Most resident clinics offer services at a reduced cost. Many offer a free consult (n = 12). Other clinics have consultation fees ranging from $25 to $250 (n = 12), most of which offered consults for $100 or less (n = 10). Many clinics offer a percentage discount on the procedure (n = 11). Others offer a tier structure of pricing depending on the time and complexity of the procedure (n =7), whereas a smaller number of clinics offer a flat surgeon's fee (n = 3). Most clinics charged additionally for anesthesia and facility fees at standard prices (n = 13). The most popular billing method used was a 50% discount on the attending surgeon fee, with the patient being responsible for the entirety of hospital and anesthesia fees (n = 6).
 CONCLUSIONSThe authors found aesthetic chief resident clinics to differ greatly in their structure. Yet, the variety of procedures and services offered makes participation in aesthetic resident clinic an effective training method for the development of both aesthetic surgical technique and autonomy.Peter J.
