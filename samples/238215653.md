Elemental abundances of the most metal-poor stars reflect the conditions in the early Galaxy and the properties of the first stars. We present a spectroscopic follow-up of two ultra metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-4.0) identified by the survey Pristine: Pristine 221.8781+9.7844 and Pristine 237.8588+12.5660 (hereafter Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively). Combining data with earlier observations, we find a radial velocity of -149.25 ± 0.27 and -3.18 ± 0.19 km/s for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively, with no evidence of variability between 2018 and 2020. From a one-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we measure [Fe/H] LTE =-4.79 ± 0.14 for Pr 221 and [Fe/H] LTE =-4.22 ± 0.12 for Pr 237, in good agreement with previous studies. Abundances of Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Sr were derived based on the non-LTE (NLTE) line formation calculations. When NLTE effects are included, we measure slightly higher metallicities: [Fe/H] NLTE =-4.40 ± 0.13 and [Fe/H] NLTE =-3.93 ± 0.12, for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively. Analysis of the G-band yields [C/Fe] 1D−LTE ≤ +2.3 and [C/Fe] 1D−LTE ≤ +2.0 for Pr 221 and Pr 237. Both stars belong to the low-carbon band. Upper limits on nitrogen abundances are also derived. Abundances for other elements exhibit good agreement with those of stars with similar parameters.Finally, to get insight into the properties of their progenitors, we compare NLTE abundances to theoretical yields of zerometallicity supernovae. This suggests that the supernovae progenitors had masses ranging from 10.6 to 14.4 M and low-energy explosions with 0.3-1.2 × 10 51 erg.

# INTRODUCTION

The most metal-poor stars in the Galaxy tell us about the conditions found during the first stages of chemical enrichment (e.g. Beers & Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programmes 299.D-5042, 102.D-0766 and 104.B-0305 and on observations made with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), installed at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, in the island of La Palma. Programme ID 39-GTC16/17A. † E-mail: carmela.lardo2@unibo.it fewer than 20 stars are known to have iron abundance below [Fe/H] < -4.5 (Norris et al. 2007;Christlieb et al. 2004;Caffau et al. 2011Caffau et al. , 2016Hansen et al. 2014;Keller et al. 2014;Allende Prieto et al. 2015;Bonifacio et al. 2015;Frebel et al. 2005Frebel et al. , 2008Aguado et al. 2018a,b;Starkenburg et al. 2018). The wide-field photometric survey Pristine has been especially designed to identify extremely metal-poor stars in an efficient manner  1 . Whereas many surveys for the search of extremely metal-poor stars have relied on spectra -HK Survey ; Hamburg ESO Survey (Christlieb et al. 2002Frebel et al. 2005Frebel et al. , 2006; RAVE (Steinmetz et al. 2006;Fulbright et al. 2010)); Pristine -like the SkyMapper Southern Sky (Keller et al. 2007;Wolf et al. 2018), the S-PLUS (Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2019;Whitten et al. 2021), and the J-PLUS (Cenarro et al. 2019) surveys; uses a photometric filter to isolate specific spectral regions that are sensitive to metallicity. Indeed, the Pristine Ca HK filter is centred on the lines of ionised calcium in the near ultraviolet which are extremely strong -and thus easily detectable-even at very lowmetallicities. Medium-and high-resolution spectroscopic follow-ups have been secured to fully characterise candidate metal-poor stars pre-selected by Pristine and study their chemical composition in great detail (Youakim et al. 2017;Starkenburg et al. 2018;Bonifacio et al. 2019;Aguado et al. 2019a;Arentsen et al. 2020;Caffau et al. 2017Caffau et al. , 2020Venn et al. 2020;Kielty et al. 2020).

Pristine_221.8781+09.7844 (Pr 221 hereafter) was first highlighted in the Pristine photometry as an extremely metal-poor star and it was followed up spectroscopically using the medium-resolution Intermediate-dispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System (ISIS) at the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (La Palma, Spain). This discovery led to the acquisition of high-resolution UVES spectra taken at the Kueyen 8.2m Very Large Telescope (VLT; Paranal, Chile). The analysis of the high-resolution data confirmed the ultra metal-poor nature of the star ([Fe/H] = -4.66 ± 0.13) with an enhancement of 0.3-0.4 dex in α-elements and a remarkably low carbon abundance (Starkenburg et al. 2018). These authors were able to put an upper limit of log (C) ≤ 5.6 ([C/Fe] ≤ +1.76), a value well below typical values in the ultra metal-poor regime, suggesting that the star is carbon-normal (see discussion in Starkenburg et al. 2018). This makes Pr 221 one of the three most metal-poor star (all metals included) known to date together with SDSS J102915+172927, a star with [Fe/H] LTE =-4.73 ([Fe/H] NLTE =-4.60) and carbon abundance log (C) ≤ 4.3 (Caffau et al. 2012) and HE 0557-4840 (Norris et al. 2007(Norris et al. , 2012 The ongoing low-resolution campaign to confirm the extremely and ultra metal-poor candidates identified in Pristine photometry has yielded another interesting object: Pristine 237.8588+12.5660 (Pr 237 hereafter). Aguado et al. (2019a) measured a metallicity of [Fe/H] =-3.88 ± 0.08 from the Ca K line with a nearly flat CH-band from the medium-resolution spectrum obtained with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS) mounted on the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope. From a high-resolution analysis, Kielty et al. (2020) determined a metallicity of [Fe I/H]≤-4.28 from the analysis of five Fe I lines. However, due to the limited wavelength coverage of their high-resolution spectra, the only elements whose abundances 1 Pristine reaches a ∼23% success rate in detecting [Fe/H]≤-3 stars whereas previous surveys have a success rate of ≤ 5% (Aguado et al. 2019a). could be measured were lithium, magnesium, and calcium, whereas other key elements have only upper limits to their abundances.

At extremely low metallicities, stars typically show a somewhat high carbon abundance (e.g. Spite et al. 2013;Bonifacio et al. 2015;Norris et al. 2013;Hansen et al. 2016;Yoon et al. 2018;Rasmussen et al. 2020). Interestingly, this seems to be a function of the stellar metallicity, placing them all around the absolute C abundance of log ε (C) ∼6.3 ± 0.5. This in turn, suggests that (i) first stars generally produced copious amounts of carbon during late stages of stellar evolution and/or their explosions (e.g. Umeda & Nomoto 2003;Meynet et al. 2006;Ekström et al. 2008;Choplin et al. 2018) and (ii) a certain amount of metals available in the gas cloud out of which second generation objects were formed might be needed to cool down, fragment and eventually form low-mass stars . The existence of a class of ultra metal-poor stars which are not severely carbon-enhanced therefore has enormous implications for the formation of low-mass stars at high-redshifts.

In order to get further insight into the physics of early star formation and the properties of the first supernovae, it is important to fully characterise the abundance pattern and, in particular, the carbon content of these interesting objects. In this paper we present and analyse new high-resolution observations of Pr 221 and Pr 237 to complement and expand the studies of Starkenburg et al. (2018), Aguado et al. (2019a), and Kielty et al. (2020).

The paper is organised as follows. In §2 we discuss the observations and data reduction. §3 contains a description of the stellar parameters and abundance derivations; §4 presents the abundance results. In particular, in §4.1 we focus on carbon abundances. In §4.4 we compare elemental abundances to a set of theoretical yields of zero-metallicity supernovae to characterise the properties of the UMP progenitor supernovae. Finally, we summarise our findings and draw the conclusions in §5.


# OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

Observations were carried out with the UVES spectrograph (Dekker et al. 2000) between 16 Mar to 22 Mar 2020 in delegated visitor mode, with relatively good atmospheric conditions, e.g., the typical seeing was around 1.0 . For these high-resolution observations, we used the standard setting DIC1 390+580, that covers the wavelength intervals 3300-4500Å in the blue arm, and 4790-5760 Å and 5840-6800 Å in the red arm. The adopted set-up was combined with a slit width of 1 with 1 × 1 binning on the CCD. Observations were split in 14 and 15 observing blocks, respectively for Pr 221 and Pr 237, corresponding to 14:45 hr and 13 hr of total integration time.

UVES Spectra were reduced using the ESO Common Pipeline Library, UVES pipeline version 5.10.4 2 . The pipeline processing steps include bias subtraction, background subtraction optimal extraction, automatic sky subtraction, flat-fielding of the extracted spectra, wavelength calibration constructed from the Th-Ar lamp exposure, resampling at a constant wavelength step and optimal merging of the echelle orders.

The reduced spectra were then corrected for the barycentric velocity. Spectra shifted to the rest wavelength and smoothed to the resolution of 30 000 are combined as final step. Observations for Pr 221 were complemented with data from the DDT UVES programme (Programme 299.D-5042; which was using the same observational setup; see Starkenburg et al. 2018   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per pixel of the final combined spectra are 90 at 4000 Å , 160 a 5300 Å, and 300 at 6700 Å. In Figure 1 we show some selected spectral intervals of the analysed UVES spectra to illustrate the high-quality of the data.


## Medium-resolution data

Pr 237 was also observed using the medium-resolution Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) located in the Roque de los Muchachos observatory (La Palma, Spain). We dedicated 1hr of GTC observing time to obtain a long-slit spectrum with the R2500U VPH grating covering the spectral range 3440-4610 Å and 1.0 slit, leading to a resolving power of R∼2400. OSIRIS spectra were reduced in a standard manner including bias, flat-field correction, extraction, sky subtraction, [!h]  and wavelength calibration. The mean SNR of the combined OSIRIS spectrum of Pr 237 is 170.


## Radial velocity measurements

Radial velocities (RVs) have been derived using (Stetson & Pancino 2008) on individual UVES exposures. The blue and red arms were analysed independently and the agreement between the two radial velocity estimates is good (i.e. the difference is less than 1.5 km s −1 for both stars). The radial heliocentric velocity of the final spectrum is measured to be -149.25 ± 0.27 km s −1 (σ=1.1 km s −1 ) and -3.18 ± 0.19 km s −1 (σ=0.7 km s −1 ) for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively. These derived values are in excellent agreement with those derived by Starkenburg et al. (2018) for Pr 221 (-149.0 ± 0.5 km s −1 ) and Kielty et al. (2020) for Pr 237 (-3.8 ± 0.9 km s −1 ).

For both stars, no significant velocity variations are measured on different exposures. Therefore, we have no evidence that these stars might be influenced by any binary companion and we continue with the assumption that the stars are single for the remainder of the paper. A complete discussion of the orbital properties in the Galaxy of the target stars can be found in Sestito et al. (2019Sestito et al. ( , 2020 and Kielty et al. (2020).

RV measurements for the two stars analysed in this paper are listed in Table 1, along with other useful information.


# CHEMICAL ANALYSIS


## Stellar Parameters

We derive stellar parameters following the approach outlined in Kielty et al. (2020). Briefly, effective temperature (T eff ) is computed using the Mucciarelli & Bellazzini (2020) colour-T eff relation, which combines effective temperatures derived by González Hernández & Bonifacio (2009) through the infrared flux method (IRFM) with the photometry available from the second release of the ESA/Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016 and the Kband magnitudes from the 2MASS database (Skrutskie et al. 2006). The adopted extinction coefficient from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) are re-adapted for Gaia DR2 photometry 3 . Surface gravity (logg) was determined with the Stefan-Boltzmann equation and the bolometric correction for Gaia filters (Andrae et al. 2018). The stellar mass is treated as a flat prior, spanning a range from 0.5 to 1 M . Parallaxes are from Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016Collaboration et al. , 2018.

The Mucciarelli & Bellazzini (2020) temperature calibration requires assumption about whether the star is a dwarf or giant and a value for the metallicity. In our computation we assume a metallicity [Fe/H]=-4.0 ± 0.3 and use MIST/MESA isochrones (Paxton et al. 2011;Dotter 2016) to preliminary select between the dwarf/giant solution. Then we iterate the inference of the Mucciarelli & Bellazzini (2020) temperatures using the logg from Stefan-Boltzmann as input, and then again the logg with the new temperature. We did these iterations 1000 times to check for convergence or changes under small perturbations. Uncertainties associated to the atmospheric parameters are derived through Monte Carlo sampling of the input data taking into account the uncertainties associated to photometry, metallicity, distance, and extinction (e.g. Kielty et al. 2020).

For Pr 221, we found T eff = 5683 ± 134 K and logg= 3.03 ± 0.10. The derived stellar parameters are consistent with those derived in the studies of Sestito et al. (2019) (T eff =5710±65 K, logg=3.1±0.1), and Starkenburg et al. (2018) (T eff =5792±100 K, e logg=3.5±0.5), who adopted a slightly different approach to estimate atmospheric parameters. In Starkenburg et al. (2018), an effective temperature of T IRFM eff = 5877 ± 62 K was derived using the IRFM of González Hernández & Bonifacio (2009) and a surface gravity of logg=3.5. Since the available photometry from 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006) has too large uncertainties to be used to infer reliable temperatures, these derivations rely on the infrared UKIDSS JHK magnitudes (Lawrence et al. 2007) transformed into the 2MASS system and V = 16.356 ± 0.020 from Henden et al. (2016). Magnitudes were dereddened E(B-V)= 0.024 from Schlegel et al. (1998). The same method provides for each of the infrared UKIDSS JHK magnitudes (Lawrence et al. 2007) transformed into the 2MASS system very consistent values of T IRFM eff = 5883 ± 77 K, 5878 ± 54 K, and 5871 ± 60 K; for the J, H,and K s band; respectively. Changing the surface gravity value from logg= 3.5 to 3.0 (as assumed here) would yield an effective temperature only 13 K hotter (T IRFM eff = 5884 ± 62 K). For Pr 237 we adopted T eff = 6148 ± 175 K and logg= 3.61 ± 0.10 as in Kielty et al. (2020). The infrared 2MASS magnitudes J = 14.509 ± 0.035, H = 14.266 ± 0.042, and K s = 14.257 ± 0.060 are also in this case not accurate enough to infer reliable temperatures. Unfortunately, no UKIDSS JHK infrared magnitudes are available for Pr 237. Using the 2MASS infrared magnitudes and assuming V = 15.611 ± 0.022 (Henden et al. 2016) and reddening E(B-V) = 0.039 (Schlegel et al. 1998), we derive for Pr 237 T IRFM eff = 6330 ± 200 K (González Hernández & Bonifacio 2009).

The effective temperatures derived from the Gaia photometry differ by ∆ T eff ∼ -180 K from those derived using ground based photometry. With the available spectra, an inspection of the wings of the Balmer lines does not favour one solution over the other. The IRFM method requires accurate infrared photometry and reddening to estimate reliable temperatures. On the other hand, the Mucciarelli & Bellazzini (2020) calibration rely on all-sky, superb quality photometry from Gaia. Thus, we decided to use the Mucciarelli & Bellazzini (2020) calibration to estimate effective temperature and adopt the Kielty et al. (2020) procedure to derive stellar parameters. In § 3.2 we discuss how the derived abundances would change because of the uncertainties on the atmospheric parameters.


## Abundance measurements


### High-resolution UVES data

We determined the chemical abundances for all the measured elements (except carbon and nitrogen) through the measurement of the equivalent widths (EWs) of atomic transition lines.

The atomic line list largely overlaps the one described in Starkenburg et al. (2018), except for the atomic data for the Mg I lines at 5172 Å and 5183 Å, for which we used the experimental log(gf)values from Aldenius et al. (2007) and the predicted log(gf)-values from Yan & Drake (1995) for the Li transition at 6707 Å. Equivalent widths were measured with the code (Stetson & Pancino 2008) through the wrapper 4 (Mucciarelli 2013(Mucciarelli , 2017. Uncertainties on the equivalent width measurements are estimated by as the standard deviation of the local flux residuals and represent a 68% confidence interval of the derived EW.

Elemental abundances from EWs were measured using the package G ) based on the 9 code by Kurucz. Model atmospheres were calculated with the 9 code assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and onedimensional, plane-parallel geometry; starting from the grid of models available on F. Castelli's website (Castelli & Kurucz 2003). The 9 models employed were computed with the new set of opacity distribution functions and exclude approximate overshooting in calculating the convective flux (Castelli & Kurucz 2003). We run G keeping T eff , log(g) and microturbulence of the model fixed, allowing its metallicity to vary in order to match the Fe abundance measured from EWs. For all the models we adopted as input metallicity the iron abundances derived by Starkenburg et al. (2018) and Kielty et al. (2020). Only lines with a reduced EW (EWr = log (EW/λ)) between -5.9 (corresponding to ∼5.5 mÅ for a line at 4300Å) and -4.7 (corresponding to ∼87 mÅ for a line at 4300Å) were considered in the abundance analysis, in order to avoid weak and noisy lines as well as strong features in the flat part of the curve of growth. All the lines with equivalent width uncertainties larger than 15% 4 are also excluded. Finally, to compute the abundance of iron, we kept only lines within 3σ from the median iron value. In the analysis for this work the microturbulent velocity is fixed at 1.5 km s −1 . The solar values are all from Lodders et al. (2009). For carbon and iron we use the solar abundances of Caffau et al. (2011).

Equivalent width measurements for individual lines and corresponding elemental abundances are reported in Table 2. This table also lists the wavelength, excitation potential (E exc ) and oscillator strengths (log (gf)) of the considered atomic transitions. The averaged results for each element are listed in Table 3. For the elements for which we measured more than one line, we provide in Table 3 the dispersion of the single line measurements around the mean normalised to the root square of the number of used lines that can be used to estimate the uncertainties associated with the measurements.

When the line-to-line scatter is relatively small (≤0.1 dex), the error is dominated by the errors due to the uncertainties in the stellar parameters. The error is dominated by the uncertainties associated with the derivation of atmospheric parameters, also in the case where only one line is measured for a given element. Uncertainties due to the atmospheric parameters are computed varying one parameter at a time by the corresponding error, while keeping the others fixed. They are listed in Table 4 for the two stars. All elements show a significant change with a ∼ 150 K variation in temperature. On the contrary, changes in the adopted microturbulent velocity result in very small abundance variations for all elements. Finally, only abundances for those elements which appear in their ionised states (i.e., Ca , Ti , Sr ) are sensitive to changes in surface gravity.

The recommended error estimates associated to the measured abundances (e[X/H]) are summarised in Table 3. Table 2. Equivalent widths and associated LTE abundances for Pr 221 and Pr 237. The corresponding NLTE abundances are also listed (see text). Data for the atomic transitions analysed are also reported.

### Medium-resolution analysis of Pr 237

An estimate of the carbon content and metallicity of Pr 237 is obtained for the medium-resolution GTC/OSIRIS spectrum by comparing theoretical spectra with the observed one. Model atmospheres were computed with the K codes as described in Mészáros et al. (2012). Modelled spectra were produced using synthesis code ASS T (Koesterke et al. 2008 


## NLTE Calculations

At very low metallicities, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects are often significant (Asplund 2005). The electron density decreases and the collision rates are greatly reduced with decreasing metal abundance. Furthermore, the radiation is absorbed by a smaller fraction of metal atoms and ions and the photoionization rate increases (Gehren et al. 2004). Since the departures of the excitation and ionisation states of the elements from the thermodynamic equilibria are more extreme in metal-poor and hotter atmospheres, the NLTE abundances provide a more realistic picture of the overall chemical pattern of our unevolved UMP targets. As a first attempt to determine the NLTE abundance patterns that can be compared with Population III supernova nucleosynthesis yields, we performed the NLTE calculations for Na , Mg , Al , Si , Ca -, Ti -, Fe -, and Sr , using the NLTE methods developed in our earlier studies and based on the most up-to-date atomic data available so far. In metal-poor atmospheres, collisional rates are mainly determined by collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms. For Na (Alexeeva et al. 2014), Mg (Mashonkina 2013), Al (Baumueller & Gehren 1996;Mashonkina et al. 2016), Si (Mashonkina 2020), Ca - (Mashonkina et al. 2007(Mashonkina et al. , 2017a, and Sr (Belyakova & Mashonkina 1997;Mashonkina 2021), collisions with H atoms were treated by implementing the quantum-mechanical rate coefficients from calculations of Barklem et al. (2010, Na ), Barklem et al. (2012, Mg ), Belyaev (2013, Al ), Belyaev et al. (2014, Si ) Mashonkina (2021, Sr ). For Ti -and Fe -, we used the Drawinian rates (Steenbock & Holweger 1984) scaled by S H =1 and 0.5, respectively, according to empirical estimates of Sitnova et al. (2016) and Mashonkina et al. (2011). The coupled radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations were solved with the code (Butler & Giddings 1985), where the opacity package was revised as presented by Mashonkina et al. (2011).

For Li , we applied the NLTE abundance corrections from Lind et al. (2009). In the literature, there are no NLTE corrections for lines of Sc , Cr , and Ni for atmospheric parameters relevant to the analysed stars. Thus, we provide only LTE abundances for those elements.

Line-to-line elemental abundances corrected for NLTE are in Table 2. The NLTE effects turn out to be rather small (∆ NLTE = log ε NLTE -log ε LTE ≤ 0.05 dex) for Li , Na , and Ca . On the other hand, significant abundance shifts were found for the minority species which are subject to overionization, such as Mg , Al , Ca , and Fe , with positive ∆ NLTE corrections always larger than 0.3 dex.


## Comments on individual elements

Lithium was detected in both stars, although we note that the continuum determination may have a significant impact on the measured abundances (see also Starkenburg et al. 2018).

We measured the 5890 Å line of Na for Pr 221, being the same line in Pr 237 distorted by interstellar absorption. The blue Mg triplet and green Mg b lines were detected in both spectra and their resulting abundances are in good agreement. Al was measured from the Al 3961 Å line, since the other Al line at 3944 Å line is severely contaminated by CH features. It was possible to detect usable Si and Sc lines only in the Pr 221 spectrum.

For both objects, Ca abundances were derived from the Ca line at 4226 Å. For Pr 221 we also measured the calcium abundance from the synthesis of the Ca K line. The abundances in LTE differ by 0.45 dex, with a higher Ca abundance. However, the observed discrepancy is greatly reduced when abundances are corrected for NLTE. In § 3.6 we use ionisation equilibrium of calcium as a consistency check on the surface gravity value adopted for Pr 221 from photometry.

Abundances for Ti were measured from two and five lines for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively. A Cr feature at 4254 Å can be detected in the spectrum of Pr 237, however such line is extremely weak and therefore extremely noisy and sensitive to the continuum placement. Thus, the provided value should be regarded as an upper limit to the actual Cr abundance measurement. Abundances for Ni have been derived from the blue feature at 3858 Å. Sr measurements are based on just one line in Pr 221 and two lines in Pr 237.

In Table 3 we also provide upper limits for Y , and Eu . For these elements there is considerable uncertainty in the measurement of the EWs, because they are weak (i.e. < 10 mÅ) and noisy.


## Carbon and Nitrogen

We use spectrum synthesis to analyse features of CH and NH and constrain the abundances of carbon and nitrogen. The synthetic spectra were computed with the code developed by Kurucz (Kurucz 2005) in its Linux version (Sbordone 2005) and adopting the same model atmospheres used to derive the abundances from EWs. The molecular line list are taken from Masseron et al. (2014) and the latest Kurucz compilation 6 .

The C abundance is determined from the CH lines in the G band (the region between 4309-4314 Å and 4365-4369 Å) which are almost free from atomic blends. For Pr 221, further constraints on carbon abundances are obtained from the CH 3944 Å line, which blends the Al resonance line at 3944 Å. Such line was shown by Arpigny & Magain (1983) to be severely blended with several CH lines, even in stars where CH was not a prominent feature of the spectrum. Corrections for the effect of evolutionary status on carbon are negligible (i.e. less than 0.01) for both stars, because of their unevolved nature ).

An upper limit to the nitrogen abundance is derived for both stars from the ultraviolet NH band A 3 Π i -X 3 Σ − at 3360 Å.


## Consistency check on atmospheric parameters

Calcium is observed in two ionisation stages in the spectrum of Pr 221. From the Ca line at 4226 Å, we measure an abundance of log ε (Ca) = 1.77 ± 0.12, whereas the analysis of the Ca line at 3933 Å gives log ε (Ca) = 2.22 ± 0.14. Both lines are subject to departures from LTE, however, the NLTE corrections for the two lines are different. For the Ca line at 4226 Å, NLTE raises the abundance by 0.3 dex and leads to an NLTE abundance of log ε (Ca) = 2.07. Conversely, the NLTE correction for Ca line at 3993 Å is slightly negative (-0.04 dex). This brings the abundances derived from lines of the two ionisation stages in good agreement. Thus, we conclude that the Ca /Ca ionisation equilibrium is fulfilled for the atmospheric parameters we have adopted for Pr 221. Starkenburg et al. (2018) were able to put an upper limit of log ε(C) ≤ 5.6 to the carbon abundance of Pr 221 using the WHT/ISIS spectrum at intermediate resolution (R∼2400). Despite the relatively good SNR of their high-resolution UVES spectrum (SNR∼ 45 at 4000 Å), the quality of the data was not sufficient to detect carbon enhancement below the level already set by the higher SNR medium-resolution spectrum.


# RESULTS


## Constraints on the C and N abundances

6 http://wwwuser.oat.ts.astro.it/castelli/linelists.html Because of the low metallicity and the relatively high effective temperatures of the target stars, large changes in carbon abundances have an extremely small impact on the appearance of the (weak) CH absorption. The synthetic spectra of Figure 2 show that the difference between log ε(C) = 5.5 and log ε(C) = 6 never exceeds the 2% of the flux. Despite the noise and the uncertainties in the continuum placement, it seems that the theoretical spectrum with log ε(C) ≤ 6.0 ([C/Fe] ≤ +2.29) presents a conservative upper limit to the carbon abundance. However, the SNR of the combined UVES spectrum of Pr 221 is still too low to permit accurate analysis of individual CH lines at the wavelengths shown in Fig. 2.

As noted by Arpigny & Magain (1983), the Al line at 3944 Å is severely contaminated by CH. We used the 3944 Å blend to check the estimated C abundance of Pr 221. The aluminium NLTE and LTE abundances were fixed from analysis of the second line of the resonance doublet, Al 3961 Å. Since the NLTE abundance corrections for Al 3944 and 3961 Å are equal, in this section, we perform analysis of these lines under the LTE assumption. Figure 3 (top left-hand panel) shows that log ε(Al ) = 1.38 represents the best LTE fit to the observed spectrum of Al 3961 Å.

The same figure 3 also shows the impact of different carbon abundances on the synthetic spectra computed around the Al line at 3944 Å. An increasing abundance of carbon mainly enhances the spectral feature at the blue end of the Al 3944 Å line. If one assumes that the blue wing is noise and that log ε(C)=5.0 (top right panel of Fig. 3), we derive an abundance of log ε(Al ) = 1.54 , which is greater than the value measured from the fit of the Al line at 3961 Å. This indicates, that the solution with log ε (C) = 5.0 is not favoured, since carbon should be more abundant to contribute to the left wing of the Al 3944 Å blend.

The model with log (C)=5.5 and log ε(Al ) = 1.38 seems to repro-   duce well the observed Al 3944 Å feature, and in this case the derived Al abundance agrees with that inferred from the clean Al 3961 Å. The log ε (C)= 5.5 value is lower than the C abundance deduced from the G band and supports our conclusion that Pr 221 does not belong to strongly C-enhanced stars. Figure 2 shows the observed spectrum of Pr 221 around the NH band at 3360 Å. From the comparison of the observed spectrum with synthetic ones with varying nitrogen abundances, we estimate an upper limit of log ε (N) ≤ 5.0 to the nitrogen content of Pr 221.

In Figure 4, we compare the UVES spectrum of Pr 237 with theoretical models with varying carbon and nitrogen abundances. Because of the high effective temperature and low metallicity, models spanning a large range in carbon abundances (from log (C)=5.0 to 6.5) differ by less than 2% of the flux. Thus, despite the high quality of the data, we are only able to put an upper limit to the C abundance of log ε (C) < 6.3. This would correspond to to [C/Fe] < +2.02, when taken together with the high-resolution measurement of iron, [Fe/H]= -4.22. A similar upper limit of [C/Fe] < 1.90 can be derived by the medium resolution spectrum using metallicity from the highresolution UVES spectrum. When the measured carbon abundance  is taken together with the metallicity derived from from the medium-resolution data, the upper limit to the carbon abundance is [C/Fe]< +2.10 (see also Figure 5).Therefore, we assume log ε (C) < 6.3 as a conservative upper limit to the carbon abundance of Pr 237. From a careful inspection of the right-hand panel of Figure 4, we adopt log ε (N) ≤ 6.0 as the upper limit for the nitrogen abundance of Pr 237.

Due to the reduced radiative heating with a shortage of spectral lines, the temperature structures of metal-poor 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres are much cooler in the higher atmospheric layers (e.g. Asplund 2005). This translate into large 3D effects for temperature-sensitive species like molecules (see e.g. Asplund & García Pérez 2001;González Hernández et al. 2010;Gallagher et al. 2016Gallagher et al. , 2017Nordlander et al. 2017;Collet et al. 2007Collet et al. , 2018. The complete 3D analysis of target stars is beyond the scope of this study, but we refer to the 3D corrections derived by Caffau et al. (2012) for SDSS J102915+172927 -a star with stellar parameters and abundances similar to Pr 221 (see discussion in Starkenburg et al. 2018) -to give a qualitative idea of the corrections expected for the carbon and nitrogen abundances discussed here. The work of Caffau et al. (2012) shows that the use of 3D, LTE modelling (as opposed to our 1D, LTE procedure) would lead to significantly lower abundances for both carbon and nitrogen (by -0.7 and -0.9 dex, respectively). Unfortunately, no detailed calculations for departures from LTE for CH and NH with realistic molecular models exist.


## Overall chemical pattern

We measured the equivalent widths of 27 Fe lines for the combined spectrum of Pr 221, which yield a final LTE abundance of  Figure 5 shows the observed GTC/OSIRIS spectrum normalised by a running mean by along with the best-fit model -with the same normalisation (Aguado et al. 2017b,a Norm.Flux Figure 5. The medium-resolution spectrum for Pr 237 as observed with GTC/OSIRIS and normalised by a running mean by the code is shown in black. The best-fit spectrum -with the same normalisation-is overplotted in red. The insets display a zoom around the Ca K line and the G-band. olution data comes from the Ca K line, for which NLTE corrections are extremely small (∼ -0.02 dex). However, we also note that the Ca K is blended with with an interstellar Ca absorption line in the GTC/OSIRIS spectrum. This may also account for the higher metallicity derived from intermediate-resolution spectrum relative to the UVES one.

In the low metallicity regime, and increasing fraction of MW halo stars has been found to be greatly enhanced in carbon, the so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars (e.g., Beers & Christlieb 2005). Depending on their abundance pattern, CEMP stars have been traditionally classified in several sub-classes: CEMP-s, CEMP-r, CEMP-r/s, and CEMP-no (Beers & Christlieb 2005) 7 . The high carbon enhancement accompanied by strong over-abundances of neutron-capture elements produced by the main s-process observed in both CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s stars is thought to be produced by mass-transfer from low-to intermediate-mass ( 4 M ) asymptotic giant-branch (AGB) companion (e.g. Starkenburg et al. 2014;Hansen et al. 2015;Abate et al. 2015;Sakari et al. 2018;Choplin et al. 2021).

On the contrary, the carbon enhancement with low (or absent) abundances of neutron-capture elements observed in CEMP-no stars is thought to reflect directly the composition of the natal gas cloud from which the star first formed. Several astrophysical sites have been proposed for the progenitors of these bona-fide second generation stars; including "faint supernovae (SNe)" that undergo mixing and fallback (e.g., Tominaga et al. 2014;Komiya et al. 2020), rapidly rotating massive stars of ultra low metallicity (e.g. Meynet et al. 2006;Chiappini et al. 2008;Maeder et al. 2015;Choplin et al. 2016), and metal-free massive stars (Heger & Woosley 2010).

In Figure 6 Figure 6 leads us to conclude that both Pr 221 and Pr 237 belong to the group of low-carbon band (Bonifacio et al. 2015) with both stars possibly being "carbon-normal" 9 . Both stars are classified as CEMP-no stars, as they do not show any overabundance of neutroncapture elements (see § 4.2) and they are associated with the low-C region (log ε (C) ≤ 7.1; Yoon et al. 2016). Additionally, among the CEMP-no sample itself, two very different behaviours in the log ε(C) versus [Fe/H] space can be observed and they are likely associated to different classes of progenitors . In particular, both stars would be classified as Group II CEMP-no stars (e.g., stars for which a clear dependence of log ε (C) on [Fe/H] is observed, see top panel of Figure 6) 10 and they can be tentatively associated faint mixing-and-fallback SNe progenitors (Nomoto et al. 2013).

Similarly to carbon, also nitrogen appears to be underabundant in Pr 221 when compared to stars of similar metallicity. However, only a few measurements of N abundance exist at this low-metallicity regime to draw firm conclusions.

In Figure 7 the absolute abundance of Li (log ε (Li)), as well as abundance ratios [X/Fe] for 11 representative elements (X) in LTE are shown as a function of [Fe/H], for Pr 221, Pr 237, and stars with metallicities lower than [Fe/H]<-3 taken from the SAGA database 11 . In this figure, Pr 221 and Pr 237 are represented as empty red circles, whereas data from literature are shown as black filled squares.

The measured lithium abundances is log ε (Li ) LTE = 1.33 and log ε (Li ) LTE = 1.74 for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively. The uncertainties we derive from the EW measurements are extremely small for both objects (0.02 dex), but a more realistic determination of the uncertainties associated to Li measurements of 0.2 dex can be obtained taking into account uncertainties due to the continuum placement (e.g. Starkenburg et al. 2018;Kielty et al. 2020).  (Aguado et al. 2019b). For Pr 221 the observed Li abundance can also be ascribed to its relatively low effective temperature. We refer to González Hernández et al. (2019 for a complete discussion on Li abundances in EMP/UMP stars. The [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] LTE ratios appear to vary from star to star by a very large factor at lower metallicities (see Figure 7). The scatter of data for stars of close metallicity is, in part, due to neglecting the departures from LTE. For [Fe/H] < −3, the Na and Al abundances can only be derived from resonance lines, for which the NLTE effects are strongly dependent on atmospheric parameters and element abundance itself (Baumueller et al. 1998;Baumueller & Gehren 1997). For Pr 221, the NLTE abundance of Na is found to be  Our UMP stars Pr 221 and Pr 237 appear to be typical Galactic halo stars with respect to the α-elements Mg, Ca, and Ti, and also Si in Pr 221 (see Figure 7). Magnesium is enhanced relatively to Fe, with [Mg/Fe] LTE = 0.53 and 0.26 in Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively. Slightly lower abundance ratios are derived in NLTE, with [Mg/Fe] NLTE = 0.46 and 0.24, respectively. In Pr 221, calcium is measured in two ionisation stages. The abundance discrepancy found in LTE between Ca and Ca nearly disappears in NLTE (see Our UMP stars Pr 221 and Pr 237 are not different from the Galactic EMP stars also with respect to Sc, Ni, and probably Cr (see Figure 7). The scandium abundance was measured for Pr 221 only, from one Sc line at 4246 Å. We derived a scandium enhancement at the level of [Sc/Fe] LTE = +0.59. Nickel follows iron. The [Ni/Fe] abundance ratio is expected to be nearly free of the NLTE effects because abundances of both elements were derived from lines of their neutral species, which have probably similar departures from LTE (Mashonkina et al. 2017b). For Cr, we could measure only the upper limit and in one star, Pr 237. = +0.06), respectively. Again, this is not exceptional for the extremely metal-poor regime of our Galaxy (see Figure 7). It was not possible to detect spectral features of any other neutron-capture element. Taken together with the measured low [Sr/Fe] ratios, this evidence would indicate that in both stars heavy elements are likely deficient with respect to iron. To clarify this issue, we compared theoretical spectra computed for varying Ba abundance with the observed spectra around the Ba 4934 Å line. From this comparison, we conclude that if Ba would overabundant relative to Fe at the level [Ba/Fe] = +0.5, we would have observed a clear Ba absorption line in the UVES spectra of the two targets. Thus, we estimated an upper limit (in LTE) of log ε (Ba) ≤ -2.8 and and ≤ -2.1 for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively (Table 3).


## Comparison with previous spectroscopic studies

The abundance of iron determined from Fe lines in this study agrees with the value published Starkenburg et al. (2018) (log ε (Fe ) = 2.86 ± 0.13) within the measurement errors. Starkenburg et al. (2018) have adopted a T eff =5792 K, which is ∼100 K warmer than the one used here. According to Table 4, the iron abundance from Fe would increase by ∼0.13 when T eff is raised by 134 K. This is the exact Fe difference measured in the two analysis. Therefore, we conclude that the difference in the derived iron abundances can entirely be attributed to the stellar parameters adopted in the two studies. Figure 9 shows that our LTE measurements are generally in line with those presented in Starkenburg et al. (2018) for the elements in common in the two studies (e.g., they are consistent within the uncertainties associated to the measurements).

The higher signal-to-noise ratio of the combined UVES spectrum of Pr 221 allows us to also provide measurements for elements for which only upper limits were derived in Starkenburg et al. (2018). From the Al line at 3961 Å we derive a LTE abundance of log ε (Al ) LTE = 1.38, which corresponds to log ε (Al ) NLTE = 2.06. This value is in good agreement with the upper limit of log ε (Al ) LTE ≤1.6 measured by Starkenburg et al. (2018). Finally, Starkenburg et al. (2018) provide the upper limit of log ε (Sr LTE ≤-1.5 for the fit of the Sr line at 4077.7 Å. From the same line, we measure an abundance of log ε (Sr ) LTE = -2.38 in LTE, which correspond to log ε (Sr ) NLTE = -2.20 in NLTE. Finally, we present abundances (and upper limits) for nitrogen, scandium, nickel, and barium which were not measured in Starkenburg et al. (2018).

For Pr 237 and the elements in common with Kielty et al. (2020) we observe a perfect agreement between their abundances and our measurements. From the analysis of five Fe and three Fe lines, they were able to put an upper limit of [Fe/H] ≤ -4.26, which is consistent with the value we have measured from the analysis of 33 lines ([Fe /H] LTE =-4.22 ± 0.12). For Li, they measure log ε (Li )=1.54 ± 0.20 which is still compatible with the abundance provided by our analysis given the large uncertainty introduced by the continuum placement when fitting the weak Li feature. Kielty et al. (2020) measured log ε (Mg ) = 3.43 ± 0.13, which again agrees with the magnesium abundance of Table 3.


## Model Predictions for UMP progenitor supernovae

We tentatively assess the properties of the progenitor population of Pr 221 and Pr 237 by comparing their abundances with theoretical model predictions of supernova (SN) yields from single non-rotating massive Population III stars in the range 9.6-100 M of Heger & Woosley (2010). We use only elements with available NLTE abundances because they are closest to true absolute abundances, which are required for a comparison with theoretical predictions. This exercise implicitly assumes that UMP stars are indeed bona-fide secondgeneration objects chemically enriched by a single Pop III supernova, as commonly accepted in Galactic archaeology studies.

The model database includes 120 models and covers a range of explosion energies from 0.3 × 10 51 erg to 10 × 10 51 erg. For each energy, there are models with different (fixed) mixing amounts in the SN ejecta due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (see Heger & Woosley 2010, for further details). We use their publicly available χ 2 matching algorithm to determine which model fits our abundances best 12 . We adopt a similar procedure as the one described in Heger & Woosley (2010), using all available element measurements and upper limits up to atomic number Z = 30, as the nucleosynthetic origin of post iron-peak elements in Pop III stars is quite uncertain.

The fitting algorithm treats Sc and Cu as model lower limits because they have multiple different nucleosynthetic pathways (e.g., there are additional production sites not included in the model data) and it ignores Li, Cr, and Zn by default. The same fitting procedure was also used in a number of other studies (e.g. Placco et al. 2015;González Hernández et al. 2020).

Models from Heger & Woosley (2010) reasonably reproduce chemical abundances in both cases. Fitting the abundance pattern of Pr 221 yields a progenitor mass of 14.4 M with little mixing (f mix = 3.98 × 10 −2 ), and a relatively low explosion energy of 1.2 ×10 51 erg. Similarly, the fitting algorithm returns a low progenitor mass (10.6 M ) with mixing f mix = 2.51 × 10 −1 , and a low explosion energy (0.3 ×10 51 erg) for Pr 237 as well.

Besides the best-fit solution, the procedure also provides the ten best model fits ranked by their χ 2 value. If the best-fit solution is robust, we expect the χ 2 value to rapidly increase between the first and second-best solutions (Placco et al. 2015). For Pr 221, the first two solutions have the same χ 2 value, but the mass of the progenitor is the same with a slightly different explosion energy (1.2 ×10 51 erg and 0.9 ×10 51 erg in the first and second best-fit solutions, respectively). The progenitor mass returned by the third-best model is only slightly different (14.0 M ) with a corresponding variation of the χ 2 value of ∼ 18%. For Pr 237 , the fitting algorithm returns the same progenitor mass and energies in the first six best-fit models.

According to Placco et al. (2015), the quality of the match between the abundance pattern of a star to the yields is highly sensitive to the N abundance. In particular, the fitting algorithm predicts a very low N abundances ([N/H] < -6) where only upper limits on nitrogen are determined. Moreover, carbon and nitrogen abundances are derived using the 1D models, thus they are significantly overestimated compared to those measured in 3D-NLTE model atmospheres (e.g. Norris & Yong 2019, and references therein). To evaluate how changes in the C and N abundances reflect on the progenitor mass we estimated, we ran the matching procedure with both carbon and nitrogen reduced by 1 dex. Overall, we obtain an improvement of the fit. Indeed, the best-fit model better reproduces carbon abundance, but there is no change in the progenitor model. We also determine the best fit parameters after excluding the N abundance from the observed pattern. We found no variations in the progenitor mass or explosion energy in both cases.

To further quantify the uncertainty in progenitor masses computed by the χ 2 matching algorithm and check the parameter degeneracy, we varied NLTE abundances for each star by their uncertainties and run the procedure using the perturbed abundances (see Fraser et al. 2017). To this aim, we assumed that measurements were normally distributed and repeated this perturbation procedure 100 times for each star. The distribution of inferred progenitor masses as a function of the explosion energies, after fitting our perturbed abundance values are shown in Fig. 10. The figure also shows the resulting χ 2 values and the amount of mixing of the different draws.

We find that supernova yields for models in a wide range of progenitor masses between 10.10 and 41.00 M well reproduce the chemical composition of Pr 221. The median value of the progenitor mass is 14.40 M , with a 1st quartile (Q1) of 14.00 M , a 3rd quartile (Q3) of 30.00 M . In addition to massive progenitors of 20-40 M exploding in general with low energies (1-2.5 ×10 51 erg), we also find good fits for progenitors with masses < 15 M , with very low explosion energies (<1 ×10 51 erg). In particular, we computed a median value for the explosion energy of 1.2 ×10 51 erg (Q1= 0.9 q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q ×10 51 erg and Q3=1.8 ×10 51 erg), with five notable outliers with explosion energy of 5 ×10 51 erg. In general, models with less mixing are favoured, with a median value of f mix =0.03981 (Q1=0.02512 and Q3=0.06310). The reduced mixing is likely due to the compact nature of the supernova progenitor star in this mass range (Heger & Woosley 2010). For Pr 237, all the best-fit models matching its perturbed NLTE abundance pattern have low mass in the range between 9.70-15.  Also, they have generally experienced low mixing (median value of f mix = 0.01585, Q1= 0.01585, Q3=0.08155) and low explosion energies (median value of 0.3 ×10 51 erg, Q1 = 0.3 ×10 51 erg, Q3 = 0.6 ×10 51 erg). Nine models have progenitor mass of 9.70-9.80 M and unusually high explosion energy (>5 ×10 51 erg). Most probably, the lack of any Na constraint for Pr 237 causes the fit to always prefer lower-mass progenitors (Ishigaki et al. 2018).

We illustrate the yields from a selection of well-fitting models in Figure 11. The models have been selected as those which best match observations for any explosion energy and mixing efficiency within the range of progenitor masses obtained from the 100 simulations for each star. Overall, both Pr 221 and Pr 237 have abundance patterns have NLTE elemental abundance patterns that are well reproduced by the SN models of Heger & Woosley (2010).

As discussed above, the existence of a nitrogen measurement is fairly important for the model fit procedure (e.g. Placco et al. 2015). Indeed, in their study of 21 UMP stars observed at high-resolution, Placco et al. (2015) found that stars with upper limits on nitrogen have progenitor masses in the 10.6-15.0 M range. In contrast, progenitor masses for stars with actual nitrogen measurements show a bimodal distribution toward higher masses (e.g., progenitor masses in the range 20.5-23.0 M and 27.0-28.0 M ). Thus, we caveat that the lack of nitrogen abundance measurements is possibly affecting the progenitor mass determination. .


# CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of two UMP stars identified in the Pristine photometry and previously analysed in Starkenburg et al. (2018) (Pr 221) and Aguado et al. (2019a) (Pr 237) based on the medium-resolution spectrum and in Kielty et al. (2020) (Pr 237) based on the high-resolution spectrum. We now briefly summarise our findings.

• We found that neither star shows any significant radial velocity variations during the observations in 2018 August (four nights; Starkenburg et al. 2018)/ 2018 June (two nights; Kielty et al. 2020) -for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively-or those in 2020 (six nights; this paper), or between the two investigations.

• We confirm the UMP nature of both stars, with measured Fe abundances of [Fe/H] LTE = -4.79 ± 0.14 and [Fe/H] LTE = -4.22 ± 0.12 for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively. This translates to [Fe/H] NLTE = -4.38 ± 0.13 and [Fe/H] NLTE = -3.93 ± 0.12 when departures from LTE are taken into account.

• The upper limits we derive on the C abundances are compatible with the two stars having a moderate C overabundance. In particular, the upper limit and tentative measurement for Pr 221we derive in § 4.1 using constraints from Al features lies on the border of the carbon-normal stars. We were able also to put an upper limit to the N abundance of both objects from the analysis of the NH feature at ∼3360 Å.

• Measured abundances for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Cr, Ti, and Ni in general exhibit good agreement with those of Galactic EMP and UMP stars. Li is depleted in Pr 221 probably because of its low effective temperature. On the other hand, the low Li abundance of Pr 237 is intrinsic as observed in many unevolved stars with [Fe/H]<-3.5 (Bonifacio et al. 2018 Bonifacio et al. (2015) that stars belonging to the low-carbon-band are carbon enhanced metal-poor stars with no overabundances of neutron-capture elements (CEMP-no according to the classification of Beers & Christlieb 2005) as opposed to stars on the high-carbon-band in which the high carbon abundance is the consequence of mass-transfer in a binary system from companion in its asymptotic giant branch phase (e.g., Hansen et al. 2016;Yoon et al. 2016; but see also Arentsen et al. 2019 for a discussion on the rôle of binarity in shaping the abundance pattern of CEMP-no stars). No detection of any RV variation further supports such scenario.

• Under the assumption that the chemical pattern of the two UMP stars directly reflect the composition of the parent gas cloud (e.g., stars have been enriched by a single Pop III supernova), their NLTE abundances suggest in both cases low-energy supernova progenitors with masses from 10.6 to 14.4 M and energies in the range between 0.3-1.2 ×10 51 erg.

The effects of changing aluminium abundances by the same amounts for the modelled spectra around the Al 3944 Å line are plotted for different carbon abundances log (C) = 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 (top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right, respectively). All modelled spectra are smoothed to a resolution of R = 30 000. The observed spectrum of Pr 221 is shown as a grey thick line in all panels. The noise level is represented by the grey shaded area .

[Fe /H] LTE =-4.79 ± 0.14. This corresponds to [Fe /H] NLTE =-4.40 ± 0.13. From the analysis of 33 Fe lines in the UVES spectrum of Pr 237, we measure [Fe /H] LTE =-4.22 ± 0.12 and [Fe /H] NLTE =-3.93 ± 0.12. The medium-resolution analysis of the GTC/OSIRIS spectrum returns a higher metallicity of [Fe/H]=-3.86 ± 0.20 dex.

[C/Fe] and [N/Fe] LTE abundances are shown as a function of [Fe/H] for Pr 221 and Pr 237 and unevolved stars (e.g., logg≥3) with metallicities lower than [Fe/H]<-3 collected from the SAGA database 8 . In the figure, Pr 221 and Pr 237 are represented as empty red circles, whereas data from the literature are shown as black filled squares. In the same figure we also highlight SDSS J102915+172927 (shown as empty blue square; Caffau et al. 2011), the star with lowest metallicity known. Inspection of the top panel of

(2015) define "carbon-rormal" stars with [Fe/H]<-4 and log ε(C)≤ 5.5 or [Fe/H]≥-4 and [C/Fe] < +1.0. Low-carbon band are stars that do not fulfil the "carbon normal" criterion and have log ε(C) ≤ 7.6. 10 This conclusion is further supported by the measured abundance of the light-elements Na and Mg in the two stars (see Figure 4 in Yoon et al. (2016)). 11 Aivalable at http://sagadatabase.C and N abundances for the two stars compared to literature values. Red empty circles are the two targets analysed in this study, whereas the blue empty square represents SDSS J102915+172927 (Caffau et al. 2011), the most metal-poor star observed so far with a similar overall chemical pattern to Pr 221 (see Starkenburg et al. 2018, for a discussion). Stars from literature with [Fe/H] ≤ -3.5 and log (g) ≥ 3 are shown as black symbols. The horizontal dashed line in the top panel gives the mean log ε (C) = 6.5 value used by Spite et al. (2013) to define carbon enhanced metal-poor stars at metallicities [Fe/H] < -3.4. 0.4. The top left-hand panel of Figure 7 we compare the absolute Li abundances derived for the two stars with log ε (Li) values form the literature for stars with surface gravities log g > 3. Both stars have Li abundance below the plateau found by Spite & Spite (1982a,b) for old and unevolved stars. This is in line with observations of stars with [Fe/H] ≤ -3 (Sbordone et al. 2010), with the notable exception of the dwarf star J0023+0307 with an [Fe/H] < -6.1 and a Li abundance of log ε(Li ) = 2.02±0.08 dex

§ 3.6), and we derive a moderate enhancement of Ca ([Ca /Fe] NLTE = 0.14 and [Ca /Fe] NLTE = 0.24). For Pr 237, the [Ca/Fe] ratio is around solar, with [Ca /Fe] LTE = -0.06 and [Ca /Fe] NLTE = -0.09. Titanium exhibits a substantial overabundance of Ti relatively to Fe in the LTE analysis, with [Ti/Fe] LTE = 0.36 and 0.56 for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively. Since the NLTE corrections for lines of Ti are smaller than that for lines of Fe , we obtain lower abundance ratios of [Ti /Fe] NLTE = 0.11 and 0.38 for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively. Thus, in Pr 221, α-enhancement is stronger for Mg than for Si, Ca, and Ti.

89The Li resonance doublet in Pr 221 (upper panel) and Pr 237 (lower panel) are shown in grey. Theoretical spectra with varying lithium abundance (see legend) are also shown. LTE (filled red triangles) and NLTE (empty blue diamonds) abundances derived in this study for Pr 221 are compared with the LTE abundances fromStarkenburg et al. (2018) (shown as black asterisks).

## Figure 10 .
10The run of the derived masses vs. explosion energies from 100 iterations of the χ 2 matching algorithm using perturbed NLTE abundances are shown for Pr 221 and Pr 237 in the top and bottom panel, respectively. Data points are colour-coded according to the amount of mixing characterising the best-fit model. The size of the data points is a function of the derived χ 2 value. Marginal histograms for the progenitor mass and explosion energy are shown as well. The rug plots display the grid of masses and explosion energies fromHeger & Woosley (2010). There are 126 different masses in the range 9.6-100 M . Model stars differ by only 0.1-0.2 M toward the lighter end of the mass range explored inHeger & Woosley (2010) to take into account for their different pre-supernova properties (seeHeger & Woosley 2010).

Finally, the measured abundance ratios for [Na/Mg], [Al/Mg], as well as [Ca/Mg] rule out any contamination from massive (140 M < M < 260 M ) exploding as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe; Heger & Woosley 2002) for both stars. In particular, the PISN models predict low [(Na,Al)/Mg] and high [Ca/Mg] abundance ratios (are not observed in the analysed stars 13 .

We measure for Pr 221 [Na/Mg] = -0.53, [Al/Mg] = -0.47, and [Ca/Mg] = -0.32. The derived [Al/Mg] and [Ca/Mg] abundance ratios for Pr 237are [Al/Mg] =-0.54 and [Ca/Mg] = -0.33.
