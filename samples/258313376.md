# | INTRODUCTION

Intramedullary spinal lipomas and especially in craniocervical area are extremely rare. They account for <1% of spinal cord tumors. 1 The cervicothoracic and thoracic regions of the dorsal cord are most commonly involved. 2 Clinical presentation is not distinctive, but radiographic evaluations can be very diagnostic. 3 Usually, total resection is not possible, and safe subtotal resection is recommended. 2 


# | CASE PRESENTATION

The patient was a 56-year-old woman. She had suffered chronic but progressive pain in her right shoulder since 20 years ago. She also complained of clumsiness in her right upper and lower limbs, and gait disturbance started 2 months ago. She had no sensory loss or bowel/bladder involvement. In the physical examination, four limbs tone and strength were normal except mild weakness in right shoulder abduction. Light touch, pinprick, and vibration perception were normal on both sides. Deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive on the right side (3+), and Hoffman sign was present on the right side. Plantar responses were upward bilaterally. Routine laboratory data were normal.

MRI showed an intradural well-defined mass lesion extending from the medulla to C4 level. it was hyperintense in T1 and T2 sequences. Fat-suppression sequence showed intensity reduction in the lesion in favor of fat tissue ( Figure 1). No bone defect or deformity was seen in the cervical spine.

Surgical excision was planned. A minimal suboccipital craniectomy and a wide C1 to C5 laminectomy were done in the prone position. The dura appeared normal. The dura and arachnoid opened in separate layers. Using microscope view, a large subpial yellowish mass from the dorsal medulla to the C4 level was evident ( Figure 2). The tumor was resected gradually using the Cavitron ultrasonic aspirator (CUSA). Bleeding was controlled using bipolar cautery. Even after mass reduction, the tumor-cord border was not identifiable except in superior and inferior poles. Due to tumor adherent features and neuromonitoring warnings, we stopped after approximately 70% tumor resection. Pathological findings were consistent with lipoma diagnosis.

Immediately after surgery, all four extremities were weakened, but the weakness was more severe on the right side. The shoulder pain decreased. Her weakness improved within 4 weeks of rehabilitation, and she could walk without help.


# | DISCUSSION

Spinal lipomas account for <1% of spinal cord lesions. 4 They often present extramedullary in the lumbosacral region and are associated with spinal dysraphism. 5,6 These tumors are considered congenital lesions and are more common in childhood. 7 Although adipocyte migration dysregulation in the embryonic period is a popular mechanism for describing dysraphic spinal cord lipomas, there is no acceptable theory explaining nondysraphic lipoma pathogenesis. 8 Here, we report a nondysraphic lipoma with the intradural perimedullary presentation, which is extremely rare.

As symptoms are not specific and the disease course is indolent, diagnosis can be delayed. Symptoms improve after proper treatment except for severe deficits, which necessitate early detection and treatment. 9 It seems that  severe deficits are not the result of mass effect but they are caused by replacing normal neural tissue with fat tissue. 1 We reviewed 13 case reports concerning intradural spinal lipoma within the craniovertebral junction, including our patient (Table 1). The male/female ratio is 10:3. Most patients are young adults. The functional improvement had been reported in eight cases. One regrowth has been reported, but reoperation was not needed. 10 It seems that the clinical course of these tumors after surgery is indolent, and regrowth will not be a concern, although close follow-up with MRI is recommended.

Age is a major predicting factor of disease progression. The risk of progression for adult patients with dysraphic and nondysraphic spinal lipomas is low. 11 MRI is diagnostic in most cases as fat is hyperintense in both T1 and T2 sequences and will be suppressed using fat-suppression sequences. 12 Management of these lesions is still controversial, and a patient-specific approach is needed. The treatment goal is to stop neurological deterioration. Because of the significant risk of neurologic deterioration following surgery (like our patient), preventive surgery is not recommended. 1 Although the amount of resection has increased using CUSA and microsurgical techniques under microscope, 22 gross total resection is not advised because fat tissue is intermingled with neural tissue, and the tumor-cord border is not clear. 9


# | CONCLUSION

Nondysraphic perimedullary spinal lipomas are extremely rare. There is no consensus regarding the management of these lesions. Generally, trying for gross total resection can lead to severe neurological deficits and is not recommended. Subtotal tumor resection using CUSA under intraoperative neuromonitoring is a rational approach for most symptomatic cases.
