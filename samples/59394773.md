Numerous accumulation and erosional forms originating from the activity of small valley glaciers or cirque glaciers occur on the highest mountains in Croatia: Velebit (1757 m) and Biokovo (1762 m).They were produced during the Upper Pleistocene, in the Würm glacial stage of the Alpine classi cation.Accumulation forms comprise ground, terminal and recessional moraines, drumlins, eskers, glacial erratics and glaciouvial and glaciolacustrine sediments.Single ridge eskers are often associated with areas of kame and kettle topography.Among erosional occurrences roche moutonnée (sheepback rocks), U-shaped valleys ranging in size from meso-macro, arêtes, hanging valleys, meso-sized cirques, kettles, and striations were noted.In the Croatian Dinarides, such forms mainly occur at an altitude between 900 and 1400 meters.During the early to middle Würm glacial maximum, the snow line was above 900 m, perhaps even above 1000 m altitude, and sea levels were 120 meters lower than at present day.Considering the features of the present relief, the ice cover was probably 200 to 300 m thick.Features of drumlins, eskers and kettles point to warm-based glaciers.The drumlins are small -up to 100 meters long and 50 meters wide, with the most common long axis ranging orientation from 130 o -310 o .The near total absence of platy clasts, as well as their stratigraphic a liation, largely re ects features of source rocks.

## Introduction

Discussions in Croatian literature about glaciation in the mountains Velebit and Biokovo took place throughout the entire 20th century, mainly among geomorphologists (Hranilovi , 1901;Gavazzi, 1903aGavazzi, , 1903b;;Rogli , 1931).However, the rst to describe moraine deposits on Mt Velebit was a geologist, precisely Nikler (1973), who identi ed glacial sediments on the Southern Velebit localities Oglavinovac, Javornik and Ribni ka Vrata as parts of the Rujno moraine and depicted the presumed boundaries of the glacier.Later, on the Basic Geological Maps 1:100 000 and Explanatory notes for Oto ac (Veli et al., 1974;Soka et al., 1976) and Gospi sheets (Soka et al., 1974;Soka et al., 1976) on Velebit Mt. and Imotski sheet (Rai et al., 1977;Rai & Papeš, 1978) on Biokovo Mt., traces of glaciation are only generally and roughly stated.This is in accordance with the opinion of senior geoscientists (Schubert, 1909;Rogli , 1931) on Pleistocene glaciations in the Croatian Dinarides.

The Rujno glacier existed on altitudes between 1300 and 1400 meters above sea level and eventually descended to 920 meters (Nikler, 1973).This indicates a relatively wide geographic distribution of Pleistocene glaciations on Velebit Mt.Later research has con rmed these ndings, thus Belij (1985) wrote on the glacial relief of Southern Velebit and illustrated its icebound top ranging from Kozjak ridge in the northwest towards Dušice Plane in the southeast.According to some authors, Middle Pleistocene glacial and periglacial deposits even extend to the present day's coast in the Novigrad Sea and Karin Sea, as well as on the islands of Krk and Pag and elsewhere on recent altitudes ranging from 75 to 300 m (Marjanac et al., 1990;Marjanac & Marjanac, 2004).Based on geomorphological traces of glaciation, e.g.exaration morphological features and forms of sediment accumulations,


## Study area and geological setting

The Velebit and Biokovo Mts. are amongst the highest mountains in the Croatian part of the Karst Dinarides.Geomorphologically and climatologically, they represent the boundary between the Continental and Mediterranean Croatia.Mt.Velebit forms a natural boundary between continental and Mediterranean climatic regions.In its peak areas, two different climate zones, the maritime and the continental, collide causing unpredictable weather patterns.The average snowy winter lasts longer than seven months.In the valleys and dolines (sinkholes) snow lingers much longer, and the so-called snow-holes retain snow throughout the whole year.Mt.Biokovo is also never ice-free in the deepest dolines (sinkholes), ice pits and ice caves.At altitudes  The Mining-Geology-Petroleum Engineering Bulletin and the authors ©, 2017, pp.77-96, DOI: 10.17794/rgn.2017.4.8 above 1200 m, there are no summer months without frost occurrences.In the higher parts of Mt.Biokovo (regularly above 800 m), precipitation throughout the cooler seasons (from late autumn to early spring) is mostly in the form of snow.Here snow preserves regularly until the beginning of the summer.This is in accordance with the results of the studies conducted on Mt.Durmitor, located 150 km away from Mt. Biokovo (Gachev et al., 2016), where on altitudes above 1910 m a number of small but permanent rn-ice patches, which can be classi ed as small glaciers, can be found.

Geological composition and structural framework have greatly in uenced the formation of relief suitable to the genesis of glaciers and its traces.The geological structure of both of these mountains is composed of scaly structures formed by reverse faulting of the original anticlines (see Figure 2).They were formed by several structural mechanisms, as evidenced by the morphology of their slopes -the northeastern slope being steepened on Velebit Mt. as opposed to the steep southwestern slope on Biokovo Mt.

Velebit Mt. was uplifted by the reverse faulting of northeastern vergencies.As the result of such tectonic movements, Northern Velebit is recently a large faulted anticline with Middle Triassic deposits in its core, and Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits in its limbs.In contrast, Southern Velebit is composed of the reversely elevated southwestern limb of an anticline.Its Late Carboniferous and Permian clastic-carbonate deposits are reversely uplifted above the Triassic-Jurassic deposits of Li ko Polje.Thus is the northeastern limb of the Southern Velebit anticline was cut off and eroded.In the southwestern limb, a continuous Middle Permian to Middle Jurassic sedimentary sequence appear, concordantly from the base to the highest peaks above 1700 m.Higher parts and the topmost peaks of the Mt.Velebit are composed of Jurassic carbonates, apart from the northern parts (Rožanski and Hajdu ki Kukovi) and southeastern parts (Crnopac), which are composed of unique Oligocene-Miocene tectogenic limestone breccias, known as Velebit breccia (Veli & Veli , 2009).The breccia were formed during the uplift of Mt.Velebit in the most active fault zones within the Jurassic and Cretaceous carbonates, along the horizontal faults.The Velebit breccia on Mt.Velebit and Lika Region are a unique phenomenon in the world (Veli & Veli , 2009;Veli et al., 2014).

Biokovo Mt. was uplifted by reverse faulting and thrusting of southwestern vergencies.Its scaly structures resulted from the subduction of the Paleogene limestones and Flysch deposits below the Upper Cretaceous and Middle Jurassic carbonates.Thus its seaward slope, which is pronouncedly steep, contains two thrust sheets -a lower sheet, with the Upper Cretaceous Kotišina deposits (carbonate breccia.and calcarenites), overlying Eocene ysch deposits, and a higher (upper) sheet, with the Middle and Upper Jurassic limestones, whose sharp edge comprises peaks ranging from 1400 to 1600 meters in height, located only 3 to 4 km away from the sea.

Development of glaciation on Velebit Mt. was partly in uenced by the relief with relatively large valleys (snow-dolines), re ecting the structure and composition of the substrate and results with karsti cation during the Middle and Late Pleistocene.Low temperatures were very important in this process -the average annual temperature was -2 o C during the Würm Glacial Maximum, which is 10 to 12 o C lower than recently (Šegota, 1966)


## Materials and methods

Research was predominantly realized by the eld investigations, with initial observations and determination of geomorphological occurrences which indicated glacial conditions, as illustrated by panoramic photographs of the Mirovo (see Figure 3 A), Struge (see Figure 3 B) and Rujno (see Figure 3 C) localities.Accumulation forms were located by GPS (coordinates), their depths, widths and heights were measured, their "peaks" were positioned and the direction of form axes were determined -mainly numerous drumlins and several eskers.Afterwards, a detailed analysis of till was done by collecting a representative number of fragments/clasts of various sizes from all the bodies (situmetry, Schreiner, 1992), measuring of three perpendicular dimensions of the clasts, determination of petrographic composition and stratigraphic ages of fragments and cobbles.A limited number of samples, granulometry was performed in a laboratory.Values were calculated in the cabinet, which, on the basis of Zingg diagram (Zingg, 1935), were the base for the determination of clast sizes.Stratigraphic ages were statistically processed, and presented in histograms.Data on clast sizes were used for correlation within three groups of localities (Northern Velebit Mt., Southern Velebit Mt., Biokovo Mt.), and for the precise identi cation of the source area of glaciers.Due to the rm knowledge of the geological composition, stratigraphy and structures of the Mts.Velebit and Biokovo, based on the stratigraphic determination of a large number of clasts, it was possible to reliably determine the ciques, travel routes and travel distances of the glaciers.In further presentation, the review of glacial occurrences and research results, are described from the North (from the Velebit Mt.) towards the South (to the Biokovo Mt.).


## Results

During the Late Pleistocene (Würm) glaciation, numerous glaciers existed on Velebit Mt.According to the available and gathered data, two areas are distinguished: Northern Velebit Mt. and Southern Velebit Mt.In chapters 4.1.to 4.5.Northern Velebit Mt. area, and in chapters 4.6.to 4.9.Southern Velebit Mt. area are described.


### Veliki Lom

Veliki Lom (see Figure 1 V


### Mali Lom

In Mali Lom (see Figures. 1 V, 2 A), at the altitude of 1230 meters, a attened drumlin eld is found, containing a ground moraine, with several smaller drumlins (see The bedrock is the Upper Jurassic limestone.The strike of the largest drumlin is 310 0 -130 0 , the lengths of their two perpendicular axes are 91 m and 50 m respectively, and the height (thickness) is about 5 m.As it was covered with the soil and the grass, details of its composi-tion were determined after the excavation.The longer axis of the largest esker has a strike of 300 0 -120 0 .Its average width is 15 m, and it is 60 m long.


### Ledena Draga

Ledena Draga (see Figures. 1 V, 2 A) lies at 1050 meters altitude.A " eld" of glacial accumulations is situated within a deep forest with several small drumlins.They are 40 x 90 m in size, with strikes 60°-240° and 135 o -315°, respectively (see Figure 6 A).Clasts of the Upper and Middle Jurassic limestones predominate in the composition (56 % and 23 % respectively, Figure 6 C).The lengths of the three axes were measured at 127 clasts and the grain shape diagram was produced.Platy forms are the rarest, while the spherical forms are the most common (see Figure 6 B).     one over another alongside its edges (see Figure 7 A).Glacial deposits are represented by a ground moraine, i.e. till, with partially rounded clasts of the Jurassic limestones and Oligocene-Miocene Velebit breccia, ranging in size between 0.5 and 20 cm (see Figure 7 B).Numerous kettles are present, especially in Mali Lubenovac, as well as erratic blocks (see Figure 7 C).Most notable is the drumlin that lies between 1300 and 1315 meters of altitude in Veliki Lubenovac, which is 15 m thick 100 m long, and about 30 m wide (see Figure 7 D).It is composed of the fragments from Velebit breccia.Its longer axis has a strike 130°-310°.Erratic blocks, composed mainly of Velebit breccia, are scattered around.The results of the measurement of 25 clasts shows that they are predominantly of spherical and discoidal forms, with some being spindly and none as platy form (see Figure 7 E).In Mali Lubenovac, at an altitude of 1280 meters, a 200 m long and about 50 m wide esker is located with the direction of strike towards 350°.


### Lubenovac


## Lubenovac locality (see


### Mirovo and Tudorevo

The best investigated features near Alan are at a small valley glacier in Mirovo (Bognar et al., 1991a    clasts, originating from the nearby slopes of this karst depression.Similar to the Oglavinovac Valley glacial deposits, detailed investigation of glacial occurrences on the Javornik Valley is in progress as well.


### Struge

Struge Pass (see Figures 1 V, 2 B, 3 B) is a locality hitherto undescribed, but recently its glacial accumulation and erosional occurrences are under detailed investigation (see Figures 12 A, 12 B, 12 C).These can be found between 1350 and 1390 meters altitude.The till is extremely poorly sorted (see Figure 12 D) and it is mainly composed of the Middle Jurassic clasts and subordinately of Upper Jurassic clasts.

A small cirque, with the clusters of till laying in elongated, decametric, tongue-like shapes lain one over another alongside its edges could be recognized (see Figure 12 A) as well as drumlins (see Figure 12 B) and erratics (see Figure 12 C).


### Rujno

Rujno is a karst Plane in Southern Velebit Mt. comprising Veliko Rujno in the eastern part, and Malo Rujno in the western part of the Plane.The rst glacial deposits ever described in Southern Velebit were found at the locality of Veliko Rujno, where they form the Rujanska Kosa Ridge, at altitudes between 800 and 950 meters (see Figures 1 V, 2 B, 3 C).They were described by Nikler (1973), who de ned them as a lateral moraine, a large, over 1.5 km long, and 150 m high body.Our research rede ned Rujanska Kosa Ridge as a large drumlin (see Figure 13 A  deposits are also present in the Veliko Rujno Plane (see Figure 14 C).They are composed of silt and ne-grained sand, with sporadic occurrences of larger (up to 15 cm) clasts.The till of Rujanska Kosa Ridge and nearby drumlins had been redeposited in the beginning of the Holocene, as glacio uvial deposits at Malo Rujno Plane.On Biokovo Mt., two localities were relatively thoroughly processed, despite being hard to reach.They are located in the northwestern part of Biokovo Mt. (see Figures 1 B, 2 C).


### Bukova ka Draga

In the northwestern part of the Biokovo Mt., in the Bukova ka Draga Valley (BD in Figures. 1 B and 2 C), on altitudes between 1030 to 1200 m, between the Bukovac Mountain hut and the Bukovac Pass, occurrences relating to the Würm glaciation were thoroughly investigated in the eld.A panoramic view shows the U-shape of the Valley, as well as arêtes rising on its SW side.These were formed by the erosion and abrasion caused by a local small valley glacier (see Figure 15 A).Several drumlins between 3 and 5 m thick, were identi ed.The northern drumlin (see Figure 15 B  spindly and discoidal clasts prevail (see Figure 16 C).This occurrence is interpreted as a consequence of glacier movement through the Bukova ka Draga Valley, where the bedrock of the glacier was of different stratigraphic units.The immediate bedrock is composed mostly of the Kotišina deposits, which, due to the small thicknesses of drumlins, outcrop at numerous locations, displaying so-called "sheepback rocks" or "roche moutonnée" (see Figure 15 E).In the higher part of the northeastern slope of Bukova ka Draga Valley, the glacier additionally encompassed the Middle Jurassic carbonates -mostly micritic limestones and carbonate breccia.On the top of the Valley bedrocks are Maastrichtian Kotišina deposits and Eocene Flysch.


### Studenci

In the karst depression Studenci, north of the mountain hut Lokva, at an altitude of 1350 m, a small valley is laid out containing remains of glacial accumulation forms (SC in Figures. 1 B and 2 C).Very highly pronounced erosional forms are situated alongside its anks and in the north, with an extension into a U-shaped valley (see Figure 17 A (1978).The bottom of the valley is covered with moraine deposits (see Figure 17 A).In the eastern part, several small drumlins appear (see Figure 17 B).Till comprises fragments ranging from 0.5 cm long to erratic blocks of 2 m (see Figure 17 C).On the surface, there are fragments between 20 and 30 cm, and below them is debris from 0.5 up to 5 cm in size.These are very small drumlins; sized 60 x 35 m and 37 x 22 m respectively, with the longer axis strike at 350 o -170 o .Based on the analysis of the shapes for 40 clasts, those of discoidal and spherical shape prevail (see Figure 17 D).Several kettles were noted (see Figure 17 A).In the northern part of the valley "sheepback rocks" or "roche moutonnée" on the Lower Cretaceous limestones age were discovered (see Figure 17 E).


## Discussion

Based on the analysis and interpretation of gathered data, as well as the results of former exploration of the Velebit and Biokovo Mts.(see Figure 1) numerous accumulation and erosional forms caused by the activity of small valley glaciers and cirque glaciers are described.According to the published data (Nikler, 1973  Both the shape of drumlins in Lubenovac and the strike of its longer axis at 130°-310°, indicate that the direction of glacier movement was at 130°, towards the Lika Region.Mirovo and Tuderevo were completely investigated and represent a unique model case containing more or less all occurrences formed by the in uence of glacier.The strikes of the drumlins, eskers and the glacial U-valley, as well as the terminal and recessional moraines, indicate movement of the glacier from the Northeast towards the Southwest and the South, generally in the direction of 210 0 , from Tudorevo and Mirovo Valleys towards the Bari evi Dolac depression.Alongside this route, fragments, boulders and blocks were deposited on a several kilometre long trail, the furthest of these Lower Jurassic Toarcian Spotty limestones up to 3,5 km, from the north part of Tudorevo Valley to the terminal mo-raine on Bilo Ridge and Pliensbachian Lithiotid limestone, more than 2 km from Dundovi Mirovo Valley to Bilo Ridge as well.The relations between the sedimentary bodies, such as the position of the recessional moraine on the older drumlin and ground moraine, the fact that the younger drumlin lies over the older one in Mirovo and the formation of younger cirques in Tudorevo, all indicate for the multiphase thaw and freeze events of the Alan Glacier.

Since the beginning of the nal phase of glacier melting, drumlins and an eskers were formed on the ground moraine, and inside the moraine itself kettles were hollowed out with ice blocks.Along with the advanced melting and retreat of the ice sheet from Mirovo towards Tudorevo, on the weakly permeable ground moraine of Mirovo and terminal moraine of Bilo Ridge serving as a dam, it is assumed that a glacier lake existed in Mirovo (Veli et al., 2011), like for the Central Velebit proposed Bo i et al., 2012.As water gradually leaked from the lake, and ground moraine deposits eroded all the way to the Middle Jurassic karsti ed carbonate base, all the wa-     By the features of drumlins, eskers and kettles, the glaciers in the investigated areas can be classi ed as warm-based glaciers (Bennett & Glasser, 2003).This is in agreement with the paleoclimatic features presented in the paper Perica & Oreši (1999).It is presumed that the mean temperature was lower than contemporary by about 10° C. The cooling occurred gradually, and the optimal conditions occurred prior to (approximately) 70000 years.In the rst phase, the climate was cool and humid, at the end very cold and arid, and the maximum cooling occurred 25000-18000 years ago (Perica & Oreši , 1999).The summers were relatively warm due to the in uence of the sea which suited the forming of warm-based glaciers.The near absence of platy clasts greatly re ects the features of source rocks.Rocks lacking lamination and of thin strati cation, such as Mesozoic and Cenozoic limestones in Velebit and Biokovo Mts. by abrasion and transport produce clasts of spherical, discoid and spindly forms.Spherical forms indicate longer transport and a higher energy of transporting medium (Zingg, 1935;Tišljar, 1994).Thus, it was possible to determine clast sources and the directions and lengths of movement of particular glaciers.Movement was relatively short -a few kilometers towards the direction of topographically lower regions.Due to the amount of spherical clasts, the longest transport could be ascribed to tills in Ledena Draga and Veliki Lom (Velebit Mt.) and Studenci (Biokovo Mt.).On other localities, discoid forms predominate, indicating relatively shorter transport routes.

Glacio uvial deposits are most widely distributed on Malo Rujno Plane, and were also identi ed on Alan Pass and Krasno village in Northern Velebit Mt. (Soka et al., 1974, Veli et al., 1974, Stepišnik, 2015) as well as on Libinje on Southern Velebit Mt.

Several curiosities should also be mentioned.At two localities on very steep seaward slopes of Biokovo Mt. sediment bodies 1 x 1.5 km in size, resembling fans, were formed (see Figure 18 A).The authors consider them as products of icefall during the melting.Furthermore, on the same side of Biokovo Mt., well developed utes 75 to 200 m were identi ed, with a height of about 850 m (see Figure 18 B), reaching from the base to the The Mining-Geology-Petroleum Engineering Bulletin and the authors ©, 2017, pp.77-96, DOI: 10.17794/rgn.2017.4.8 peaks of its peripherals, also produced as a consequence of the relatively rapid melting of large quantities of ice from the peaks of Biokovo Mt. and icefalls, precisely water and clast falls alongside a steep slope.Investigation of the glaciolacustrine deposits of Mts.Velebit and Biokovo should be vital for the more precise determination of conditions and timeframe of glaciation and its end.


## Conclusions

Numerous accumulation and erosional occurrences of glacial deposits can be found in the coastal Dinarides in Croatia, on Velebit and Biokovo Mts., originating from the activity of small valley and cirque glaciers.They are situated on altitudes of approximately 900 to 1400 meters.

The snow boundary was at least at 900 meters above sea level.That corresponds to contemporary 1000 meters, as the sea level was 120 meters lower at the time of glaciation (the Würm glacial).

Ice thickness was estimated at 200 to 300 m, and the most intense generation of glacial bodies occurred above contemporary altitudes of 1200 m.Drumlins, eskers and kettles point to warm-based glaciers.

Lengths of their movements were from 2 to 6 km, and directions of movement alongside the continental and seaward slopes of Velebit and Biokovo Mts.

On the seaward slopes no glacial features were found at altitudes below 900 meters above sea level.Investigated forms are remains of the nal (Würm) glaciation in the Late Pleistocene.

Among the accumulation forms ground, terminal and recessional moraines, drumlins, eskers, erratic blocks and glacio uvial and glaciolacustrine deposits were determined.

Eskers are of the single ridge variety, which are often associated with areas of kame and kettle topography.

Among the erosional forms sheepback rocks (roche moutonnée), U-shaped valleys of meso-macro sizes, arêtes, hanging valleys, icefall utes, meso-sized cirques, kettles and striations were de ned.

Predominant quantity of discoidal types of clasts reects the relatively shorter lengths of glacier ow.However, due to the topographical features of the Mts.Velebit and Biokovo, it would be valuable to investigate other prospective sites containing not only glacial but proglacial and periglacial features as well.



Bognar et al. (1991a, b), Bognar et al. (1997) and Bognar & Faivre (2006) presume that Northern and Central Velebit were affected by glaciation at altitudes above 1300 m.Hughes et al. (2011) stressed that "the Balkan ice caps are likely to have rivalled in size the ice masses over Pyrenees and were certainly amongst the largest ice masses of the Mediterranean mountains".During the research for preparation of the Geological guides of the Northern Velebit National Park (Veli & Veli , 2009), Paklenica National Park (Veli et al., 2014) and Nature Park Biokovo (Veli & Veli , 2016) a series of occurrences relating to glaciation were observed, which have not yet been the subject of detailed analysis and publishing in Croatian geological literature, or were partially published (Veli et al., 2010; Veli et al., 2011; Protrka et al., 2011; Veli et al., 2013).Therefore it is clear that geological exploration of traces of glaciation on Mts.Velebit and Biokovo has intensi ed over the last less than a decade, contributing to new ndings such as presented in this article.It is important to note that the degree of research, ndings and interpretation of data varies for the eleven localities described in this article.Many of these are inaccessible by roads and can only be reached by mountain tracks, undertaking steep climbs or simply "by azimuth".Apart from the relatively well investigated, such as the Alan glacier of the valley type in Tudorevo and Mirovo in Northern Velebit (see Figure 1 V) and Bukova ka Draga and Studenac on Mt.Biokovo (see Figure 1 B), some localities containing glacial sediments were merely registered and are scheduled for detailed investigation, those being primarily Oglavinovac, Javornik and Struge in the Southern Velebit.Recently, Slovenian geomorphologists published articles on glacio uvial relief on North Velebit Mt. (Stepišnik, 2015) and on pleistocene glaciation of the Biokovo Mt. (Žebre et al., 2013).

, as well as the abundant rainfall in uppermost Würm.According to the calculations presented by Bognar et al. (1991a,b), Perica & Oreši (1999) and Bognar & Faivre (2006), the total average precipitation was 4662 mm, which was enough to create large snow accumulations and regional glaciations.The snow line was at about 1300 m, and the estimated thickness of ice was 200 m (Bognar et al., 1991a, b).Glacial deposits on the Northern Velebit Mt. (see Figure 2 A) were created and deposited by the movement of small valley glaciers over the Jurassic carbonates and Velebit carbonate brecciaIn Veliki and Mali Lom valleys (see Figure 2 A, VL, ML) they are overly Upper Jurassic limestones and dolomites and Velebit breccia., but in Ledena Draga (=Cold Valley; Figure 2 A, LD) they are overly Middle Jurassic and Upper Jurassic carbonate rocks.In the Lubenovac Valley (see Figure 2 A, LU) bedrocks are of the Upper Jurassic age.The Tudorevo-Mirovo Glacier (see Figure 2 A, TM) was moving across the Lower Jurassic and Middle Jurassic carbonates on which its glacial sediments recently lay.In Southern Velebit Mt. (see Figure 2.B), at the Oglavinovac (see Figure 2 B, OG) and Javornik (see Figure 2 B, JA) cirques, moraine deposits overly Lower and Middle Jurassic carbonates.Out of these cirques the glacier moved through the U-valley Ribni ka Vrata toward the Rujno Plane (see Figure 2 B, RU).There, moraine sediments were deposited over the Upper Triassic dolomites and Jurassic limestones.Eastwardly, on the mountain valley and Pass of Struge (see Figure 2 B, ST), glacial sediments overly Middle Jurassic and Upper Jurassic carbonates.Glacial deposits from Bukova ka Draga at Biokovo Mt. (see Figure 2 C, BD) overly the Upper Cretaceous Kotišina carbonates and Eocene Flysch deposits.In the Studenci karst depression (see Figure 2 C, SC), glacial deposits were deposited over the Lower Cretaceous limestones of Aptian age.Valleys, on which sedimentary bodies of glacial origin and erosional forms were identied (from the North towards the South) are: 1.

, Figure 2 A) contains a ground moraine (see Figure 4 A), drumlins (see Figure 4 B, 4 C) and kettles (see Figure 4 D).This drumlin eld is situated at 1300 meters above sea level.The largest drumlin (see Figure 4 C) stretches about 100 m along its longer axis striking 120°-200° (130°-310°).Two excavations were done here (see Figure 4 E) up to depths of 90 cm.Below the 20 cm thick black-brownish soil lies a light-coloured ne-grained gravel/sand 40 cm thick, and below it, clasts of different sizes, including blocks, appear.Deposits are poorly sorted, and clasts are differently rounded, ranging from sharp-edged to relatively well-rounded.Based on the results of situmetry for 133

(2014) pointed out that "in spite of very favourable coastal features, late Pleistocene-Holocene relative sea-level changes along the eastern Adriatic coast are still not completely resolved, mostly due to




Furthermore, exploring the Quaternary sediments of the island of Susak located 60 km to the west of Velebit Mt., Wacha et al. (2011) and Mikul i Pavlakovi et al. (2011) concluded that loess and loess derivatives represent a very detailed record correlating to the Marine Isotope Stage MIS 3, precisely the major part of the aeolian deposits, including the tephra layers, correlates to MIS 3 -MIS 5 interval.Cooler MIS 4 began 74000 years ago, the age which can be correlated with results of Perica & Oreši (1999) who estimated the timing of optimal conditions at 70000 years.Investigations of loess sediments of Vukovar and its surroundings, approximately 300 km E-SE from Velebit Mt., show that the loess/palaeosol sequence has a very detailed record correlating with MIS 2-MIS 6, and MIS 4-MIS 5 respectively(Galovi et al., 2011; Wacha &  Frechen, 2011;Banak et al., 2016).Thus, the paleoclimatologic picture of glacial and periglacial areas of Croatia during the Upper Pleistocene is completed, as well as its in uence on glaciations of Velebit and Biokovo Mts.
