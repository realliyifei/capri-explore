FLORISTIC DIVERSITY OF INDIA AN OVERVIEW
Received: Sep 23, 2020; Accepted: Aug 13, 2020; Published: Nov 18, 2020; Paper Id.: IJBRDDEC20203Diversity, Biogeographic & Medicinal Plants
This article spots light on the different biogeographic regions, their flora with some medicinal plants of those regions.Variegated geographical, altitudinal and climatic conditions of India makes it one of the richest biodiversity zones of the world. Plants of medicine, timber, avenue, fibre, phytochemicals etc.altogether make this possible.From sea shore to high mountains; from hot desert to cold desert; from region of higher rainfall to lower creates several habitats for different flora. In several countries the medicinal plants are used as remedies from ancient timetill today. As India is rich in floral diversity, traditional medicines and drugs are also used here from the ancient time. 50% plants of every biogeographic region of India are used as the ethnomedicine by the locals and few of them are also used by the scientists, doctors and practitioners.

. India is one of the 17 megadiversity countries of the worldhaving 11.4% of the total known plant species of the whole world and 28% plant species are endemic (2). There is about 37.7% of Angiosperms, 0.15% of Gymnosperms, 5.27% of Bryophyta, 2.66% of Pteridophytes, 2.07% of Viruses, 15.24% of Algae, 31.05% of Fungi and 5.03% of Lichens of the total species found in India (1,4). India is one of the tropical countries with 4 Phytogeographical regions viz., Himalayas, Western Ghats, North-east India(Indo-Burma except Assam and Andaman Group of Islands) and Sundalands (Nicobar group of islands): also known as biodiversity hotspots of India out of the 34 biodiversity hotspots all over world.Biodiversity hotspots are those regions having 1500 endemic vascular plant species and also have lost 70% of the natural habitat. About 28% of Indian flora and about 33% of angiosperms are endemic in India (26).Moreover, Physiographically India is divided into 6 regions -the Himalayas, the Indo-Gangetic planes, Peninsular region or the Deccan region, Indian Desert, The major factor for the extremity of the climatic change is the 'Asiatic monsoon' wind system which seasonally reverses its direction. The country has various habitats with fragile ecosystems like forest, wetlands, grasslands, coastal, desert(cold, hot) and marine which provide differential habitat for both flora and fauna causing major diversity. The geographic location of the country also gives hand making India one of the Megadiversity countries; as it is present at the convergence of 3 major biogeographical realms: Eurasian, Indo-Malaysian and Afro-tropical making the floristic diversity in India by intermingling the elements.


## BIOGEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY

Biogeographical diversity shows the distribution of the species in a particular geographical region. India is one of the 17 megadiversity countries contributing 8% of the known biological species globally. Biogeographically India is divided into 10 zones with unique and distinct habitats and vegetation; based on biogeographic characteristics.   The Indian Islands-Andaman and Nicobar islands.   


## CONCLUSIONS

In this review paper I tried to put the biogeographic regions of India along with their floral biodiversity and some medicinal plants together. Biodiversity includes both flora and fauna which actually maintain the beauty of the Earth.

That's why the conservation is very important as the overexploitation and pollution is degrading the natural habitat of many species day by day, which ultimately caused the extinction of many species and many of them are at the risk of extinction. We need to protect the Earth to protect them. Due to various conditions and diverse range of floras India is blessed to be a Megadiversity country of the World.

About 70% of the medicinal plants are present in the tropical rainforest of the Eastern and Western Ghats, Himalayas, Aravallis, Chota Nagpur plateau, Sunderbans etc. Kashmir is one of the hotspot regions of the Himalayas but is not completely explored (25). We should explore more without disturbing them so that many new species could come to knowledge. Many medicinal plants are hidden in our deep forests which could be used for the benefits of the society.

## INTRODUCTION'
Floristic diversity' can be defined as the diversity of indigenous plants present in a specific area during a particular time period. India is known to have a vast diversity of flora due to various reasons; topological conditions, immense difference in climatic conditions and wide range of habitat favouring the life of different plants. About 4,65,688 species of plants have been known till today on the earth; among them 49,441 species are present in India including the bacteria, algae, lichen virus and fungi

ZONE: This forms the transition zone between the desert and the dense forest of Western Ghats. This zone is divided into different regions: one of them is the productive agricultural region of Punjab and Haryana;another part surrounds the desert of western Gujarat and Rajasthan; some parts are present behind the Western Ghats forming the rain shadow area (13). The major vegetation of this zone is dry deciduous forest, and tropical thorny forest ofAilanthus excelsa, Acacia spp., Anogeissus latifolia, Capparis decidua, Dichrostachys cinerea,Diospyros melanoxylon, Prosopis cineraria and Flacourtia spp. etc.Grasses and some bamboos are also present. As the soil of this region is not appropriate for the cultivation so it is mostly used for the plantation of medicinal and fuel trees. The forest of this zone has many medicinal herbs with great medicinal values which were not only used by the ancient people but is also used by the scientist and medicine personalstoday. There may be several plants with good phytochemical property which can be completely novel to the world. Bacopa monnieri,Calotropis gigantea, Cannabis sativa, Centella asiatica, Acorus calamus, Cassia fistula, Cardiospermum helicacabum, Bauhinia vahlii, Asparagus racemosus, Asparagus adsecendens, Cyperus rotundus, Datura metel, Justicia adhatoda, Eclipta alba, Ricinus communis, Piper betle, Phyllanthus fraternus, Rauwolfia serpentina etc. (21).f. WESTERN GHATS: In floral diversity it is second richest biogeographic region followed by Himalayas. It represents one of the 36 biodiversity hotspots all over world and one of the four hotspots in India. It is outstretched from Kanyakumari to Tapi river. This zone is laden by evergreen forest including plant species of Claophyllum, Dipterocarpus, Hopea and Mesua(8). This forest is rich with more than 4000 species of higher plants which represents about 27% of India's flora (6). Anaimalai and Nilgiri hills have subtropical forest at an altitude of 1800mt. The moist deciduous forest bears very expensive timber species such as Dalbergia latifolia, Pterocarpus marsupium, terminalia crenulate, Tectona grandis etc. Hills of Western Ghats are known for their endemism bearing about more than 1800 endemic species (2, 4). Variegated climatic conditions and heterogeneous topography creates differentiated habitats which is responsible for the unique set of plant species. At higher altitudes species of Elaeocarpus, Meliosma, Machilus, Syzygium, and Wendlandia are common. Bamboos including Bambusa spp. and Oxytenanthera; palms; Orchids; Peppers; Aroids; Gingibers are also found at the wet places formed near streams. The silent valley, an uninterrupted area of Western Ghats rain forest and tropical evergreen forest,is one of the most ecologically diverse regions of the world with some rare species; diverse species of flora and fauna makes it a rich storehouse of biodiversity. Medicinal plants-Western Ghats are rich in plant biodiversity with annuals to perennials representing various life forms from lower plants to higher plants. The medicinal plants of Western Ghats are very complex as it is a treasure house of many of them. Some of them are Anona squamosa, Buchanania lanzan, Aphanamixis polystachya, Rauvolfia serpentine,


Coastal Plains, Islands. India has 15,200km of land frontier, 329 million hectares of geographical area and 7500km long coastline with 10 biogeographical regions each with distinct vegetation depending on the type of climatic condition. From ancient time plants are used for food, fodder, fuel and medicinal purpose. Among 49,441 plant species of India, 15000 are medicinal plants and 500 species of them are mostly used for the drugs (25). The whole plant material can be used as the medicine. Not only Ayurveda but Allopathy, Unani and Homeopathy also use plants for the drug production. Ayurveda has kept the ancient medicinal system alive till time. There are also several unexplored regions in India where many more medicinal plants can be found. For the broad knowledge of the vegetation diversity of India, we have to understand the biogeography of India. For the better understanding, Rodgers and Panwar (1988) divided India into 10 biogeographical regions based on their distinct and unique vegetation. The vegetation diversity depends on the altitude, temperature, rainfall, salinity, topology etc. The vegetation is also categorized as: forest, Grasslands and shrubs etc. The climatic condition of India varies extremely from the coldest snowy Himalayan regions of North to the hottest region of Thar desert; least rainfall region to the highest rainfall region of the Northeast India; marine ecosystems to fresh water ecosystem and Mangroves of Sundarbans. The salinity of the soil decreases from the coastal regions to the mountain valleys with increasing altitude from the Sea level.Original Article

ECOLOGICALDIVERSITY 




The 10 biogeographical regions show various and unique vegetation differing from each other which are mentioned below: a.Trans Himalayan: These are present parallel to the Himalayas. Cold deserts, rocky regions and glaciers are the main components. The 1600km long cold snowy mountain range is extended from north to east(3).Dry  alpine scrubs are the major vegetation of this region; mainly Juniperus species.Thepresence of sparse vegetation; Carex, Draba, Ephedra, Kobresia, Saxifraga etc.is also seen. The Himalayan region is extended for about 2400km from east to west and shows a vast vegetation of different floras; alpine, sub-alpines, temperate, sub-tropicalforest coincide here.25000 plant species are also found in Himalayas; representing about 10% of world's known and 50% of India's known endemic flora (4,5). Temperature varies from 18-30℃. This region is rich in temperate flora with extreme growth of grasses and evergreen tall trees like conifers and oaks in western Himalayas and broad leaf plants like rhododendrons and herb like orchids are mostly found in eastern Himalayas (5). Himalayas have a majority of plant species, someof them areJuniperus indica, Juniperus recurve, Juncus sikkimensis, Calamus inermis, Corydalis cashmeriana, Meconopsis simplicifolia, Berberis concinna, Aconitum spp., Saxifraga spp., Cotoneaster microphylla, Aconogonon hookeri, Rheum nobile, Cassiope fastigata, Goultheria trichophylla, Onosoma hookeri, Anaphalis hookeri, Nardostachys jatamansi, Anemone demissa, Caltha scapose, Atragalus zemuensis etc. Medicinal plants-Himalayas are the store house of tons of medicinal plants with great economic and medicinal values. It is not only a beauty but also provides various information which are new to science and can be of great benefit to the society. The species of Rheum, Saussurea, Gentiana, Maconopsis, Cotoneaster, Polygonum, Anemone, Primula, Saxifraga, Allium, Cremanthodium, Corydalis, Juniperus, Ephedra, Hippophae, Aconitium, Podophyllum, Skimmia, Rhodiola, Ainsliaea, Dolomiaea, Dactylorhiza etc. are having great medicinal values. (24)c. North-east Himalayan region: This region is most considerable among all biogeographical regions as it is rich in biological diversity and also a rich reservoir for variety of medicinal plants which are used for both medicinal and ethnomedicinal use; it is a transitional zone of different biogeographical regions of India, Indo-Chinese, Indo-Malayan causing the intermingling of various floral elements forming a gateway of plant migration. Its vegetation is rich and diverse being classified into tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. Around 17500 flowering plants are found in India, among Medicinal plants-Being the richest reservoir of plant diversity, this region has also several medicinal plants like Indian desert includes the cold mountain desert of theTrans-Himalayas, the White Salt desert of Kutch and The Sandy desert of Rajasthan. Here we will discuss about the Sandy desert; Thar and salt desert; Thar desert is known as the Great Indian Desert which is present in the north-western part of India. It is a large arid region covers an area of about 200,000km sq. It is the world's 17 th largest desert and the 9 th largest subtropical desert situated in Rajasthan (29). Its climate,especially, is very cold winter with about 5-10℃ and dry and hot summer with temperature varying from 43-49℃. It is covered with sand and rock, so most of the vegetationis xerophytic thorny trees with reduced leaves-Cactus spp., Acacia sp.,Saccharum munja and Prosopis juliflora. The odd landscape of the Great desert only supports the hardy, drought resistant plant species to cope with the desert environmental and topological conditions of sandy soil, scarcity of water and very strong sunlight. These plants are having deep root system to absorb the groundwater, small or reduced leaves with spiky thorns to reduce transpiration (7). The soil supports different binding species such as Aerva tomentosa, Citrulus colocynthis, Crotolaria burhia & Leptadenia pyrotechnica. Bushes like Capparis decidua, Calligonumpolygonoides and Ziziphus are also found here. Lesser number of Tree species like Acacia, Tecomella undulata are found. Typical grasses of this zone are Cenchrus sp., Lasiurus syndicus. the salt desert of Kutch is a zone with high temperature, little rainfall and is also affected by the salinity. Due to these conditions the salt marshes and mangroves are mostly found here. Poaceae is the main dominated family here followed by Papilionaceae family.Senna auriculate, Acacia nilotica, Calotropis procera, Caltropis gigantia, Phyllanthus fraternus, Datura metel, Bulbostylis barbata, Argemone maxicanaforms the vegetation of this zone. Plants-Though the desert has very harsh and hot climatic conditions still it is very rich in flora diversity compared to the other deserts; one quarter of the total plants of the Thar desert is used for the benefits of the society. The medicinal plants of the Indian hot desert are mostly used in its raw form. Some Medicinal plants includeFloristic Diversity of India An Overview
