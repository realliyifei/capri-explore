Objectives Excessive alcohol use can bring about adverse health and work-related consequences in civilian and military populations. Screening for excessive drinking can help identify individuals at risk for alcohol-related problems who may require clinical interventions. The brief validated measures of alcohol use such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), or abbreviated AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C), are often included in military deployment screening and epidemiologic surveys, but appropriate cut-points must be used to effectively identify individuals at risk. Although the conventional AUDIT-C cut-points ≥4 for men and ≥3 for women are commonly used, recent validation studies of veterans and civilians recommend higher cut-points to minimise misclassification and overestimation of alcohol-related problems. This study aims to ascertain optimal AUDIT-C cut-points for detecting alcohol-related problems among serving Canadian, UK and US soldiers. Design Cross-sectional pre/post-deployment survey data were used. Settings Comprised Army locations in Canada and UK, and selected US Army units. Participants Included soldiers in each of the abovementioned settings. Outcome measures Soldiers' AUDIT scores for hazardous and harmful alcohol use or high levels of alcohol problems served as a benchmark against which optimal sex-specific AUDIT-C cut-points were assessed. Results Across the three-nation samples, AUDIT-C cutpoints of ≥6/7 for men and ≥5/6 for women performed well in detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use and provided comparable prevalence estimates to AUDIT scores ≥8 for men and ≥7 for women. The AUDIT-C cutpoint ≥8/9 for both men and women performed fair-togood when benchmarked against AUDIT ≥16, although inflated AUDIT-C-derived prevalence estimates and low positive predictive values were observed. Conclusion This multi-national study provides valuable information regarding appropriate AUDIT-C cut-points for detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and high levels of alcohol problems among soldiers. Such information can be useful for population surveillance, pre-deployment/post-deployment screening of military personnel, and clinical practice.

## INTRODUCTION

Excessive alcohol use carries major negative health, work-related and societal consequences. [1][2][3][4] Population-based studies have documented high rates of binge drinking, heavy weekly drinking and general alcohol misuse among military service members (SMs) and veterans in Canada, 5 6 the UK [7][8][9][10][11] and the US. [12][13][14] Research has also shown that


## STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY

⇒ Pre-deployment and post-deployment data from soldiers serving in the Canadian, UK and US Armies between 2002 and 2018 were used to assess optimal cut-points for the AUDIT-C. ⇒ As previous research has shown sex differences in optimal cut-points for alcohol-related problems, sex-stratified analyses with sufficient statistical power were conducted across the three-nation samples. ⇒ This study aimed to calibrate AUDIT-C cut-points against the 10-item AUDIT (as the benchmark), in order to determine comparability of prevalence estimates and ability of the AUDIT-C to detect individuals at risk for hazardous and harmful alcohol use. These two measures, however, are not independent of one another. ⇒ This study lacks an independent gold standard measure of hazardous and harmful alcohol use or alcohol use disorder, such as a clinician-administered diagnostic assessment.

Open access these rates are exacerbated by deployment and combat experiences, and alcohol overuse often co-occurs with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, traumatic brain injury and other health concerns. [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] Moreover, the assessment of alcohol overuse in the military should be an integral component of any screening, psychiatric evaluation or treatment planning. In order to effectively address concerns with alcohol overuse and its consequences, it is vital to monitor prevalence by employing valid and reliable screening tools that can be used on a population level or in primary care or specialty clinical settings.

One widely used screening tool to quantify alcohol use problems is the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a standardised screening instrument developed and validated in cross-national studies of civilian and veteran samples by the WHO. 27 Items cover three domains: alcohol consumption, dependence and harmful alcohol use or abuse. 27 Collectively, cut-points of ≥8 for men age 65 years or younger, and ≥7 for women of all ages as well as men over age 65 years, are recommended for identifying individuals with medium levels of alcohol-related problems, as an indicator of hazardous and harmful alcohol use. 27 A cut-point of ≥16, for both men and women, is used for detecting individuals with high levels of alcohol problems who are potentially at greater risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). 27 Although the 10-item AUDIT is a useful tool in assessing hazardous alcohol use and alcohol-related problems, shorter measures are critical for efficiency in clinical settings, and for reducing respondent burden in survey research. The abbreviated version, the AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C), is also well validated. The AUDIT-C uses the first three items of the 10-item AUDIT: frequency of drinking, number of drinks per day and frequency of binge drinking. 28 The AUDIT, and specifically the AUDIT-C, are the most commonly used screening tools in military and veteran populations.

Earlier validation studies have recommended AUDIT-C cut-points of ≥4 for men and ≥3 for women when screening for hazardous drinking. [28][29][30] However, when these conventional cut-points are compared with the 10-item AUDIT thresholds ≥8/7, the AUDIT-C appears to generate much higher prevalence estimates. For example, the US Department of Defence (DoD) Health Related Behaviours Surveys in 2011 and 2015, found 9.5% of SMs met the AUDIT criteria for hazardous and harmful drinking, whereas about 35% of SMs met the conventional AUDIT-C thresholds for hazardous drinking. 31 32 Additionally, several recent validation studies in both veteran and civilian populations have recommended similar or higher AUDIT-C cut-points for detecting alcohol-related problems, ranging from 4 to 8 for men and 3 to 7 for women, 33-39 contingent on the population, setting and the purpose for screening.

To further complicate matters, existing evidencebased clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) use different AUDIT-C cut-points to inform clinical decision-making.

For example, the 2015 US Veterans Affairs (VA)/DoD CPG for Substance Use Disorders 40 recommended the conventional AUDIT-C cut-points of ≥4 for men and ≥3 for women to screen for 'unhealthy alcohol use', ≥5 for provision of brief alcohol counselling and ≥8 for referral to a specialist. According to a 2011 study of Army soldiers, these cut-points corresponded to prevalence rates of 61% and 25% for unhealthy alcohol use, 40% and 18% for brief counselling and 18% and 5% for referral among male and female soldiers, respectively. 41 By 2021, the revised US VA/DoD CPG recommended the AUDIT-C cut-point ≥5 for both sexes to screen for unhealthy alcohol use and to initiate brief alcohol counselling in order to minimise the rate of false positives and to target intervention efforts accordingly. 42 In the UK Armed Forces, Ministry of Defence guidelines suggest provision of a standard information leaflet for AUDIT-C scores ≤4, Alcohol Brief Intervention for scores 5-9, and referral to a general practitioner (GP) for scores ≥10. 43 Based on these recommended cut-points, 61% of UK soldiers scored ≥5, indicative of high-risk drinking behaviours, while 2% scored ≥10, possibly requiring intervention from a GP. 43 Clearly, there are substantial differences in the level of alcohol-related risks and corresponding interventions for the different cut-points of the AUDIT-C recommended by the CPGs and other guidelines. Although the guideline-recommended cut-points are within the range of AUDIT-C cut-points studied in the literature, the corresponding level of severity and interventions are based on expert clinical consensus and not validation research. Moreover, limited research makes it challenging to determine the clinical utility of the AUDIT-C in accurately detecting high levels of alcohol problems or possible AUD, particularly when compared against AUDIT cut-point ≥16.

To date, there is scant research to ensure screening instruments for alcohol-related problems are validated for military populations. 44 Moreover, there has been no published validation research to assess appropriate cut-points of the AUDIT-C for detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use, or high levels of alcohol problems in serving military populations. The optimal cut-points for alcohol-related problems could vary depending on the population under study. Those developed in civilian or veteran populations or in primary care samples, for example, may not be suitable for serving military personnel. To this end, the current study used data of soldiers from Canada, the UK and the US in order to calibrate cut-points of the AUDIT-C against the 10-item AUDIT. This approach enables us to determine optimal AUDIT-C cut-points that provide comparable prevalence estimates to the AUDIT and discriminate between soldiers who meet thresholds for hazardous and harmful alcohol use, or high levels of alcohol problems, versus those who do not.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants

Four data sources collected between 2002 and 2018, were used in this study to calibrate AUDIT-C scores ranging from 3 to 9 against established 10-item AUDIT cut-points of ≥8 for men and ≥7 for women (for hazardous and harmful alcohol use) and ≥16 (for high levels of alcohol problems) among soldiers from Canada, the UK and the US. When available, an alternate independent alcohol use screener measure was used as an additional benchmark against which AUDIT-C cut-points were evaluated. Sociodemographic and military characteristics for the samples are presented in table 1.


## Patient and public involvement

No patients or the public were involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of this research.


## 2009-2012 Canadian Army male and female soldiers

Data from routine Enhanced Post Deployment Screening (EPDS) of Canadian Army personnel was used for the analysis. These data were collected between 2009 and 2012 from members who had deployed to various operations, but mainly in support of the mission in Afghanistan. Greater detail on the participants and the EPDS process has been described elsewhere. 6 The EPDS is a confidential (not anonymous) clinical screening process. A total of 13 256 male and 1046 female soldiers comprised the sample for analysis.


## 2004-2006 UK Army male and female soldiers

These post-deployment data were collected between June 2004 and March 2006 during Phase 1 of the King's Centre for Military Health cohort study and included UK Army male and female soldiers who had deployed to Iraq between 2003 and 2006, as well as a sample of Army personnel who were in service but did not deploy to Iraq at that time. Surveys were confidential but not anonymous. A more detailed description of the study population can be found elsewhere. 45 A total of 4182 male and 352 female active-duty soldiers who had complete AUDIT data were included in the analysis.


# US Army male soldiers

Data from US Army male soldiers from a combat arms unit who were stationed in Europe and scheduled for peacekeeping deployment in April 2002 were used. A more detailed description of the study population can be found elsewhere. 46 Survey data were confidential but not anonymous. There was a total of 1523 activeduty soldiers with complete AUDIT data. While females were included in the survey, there were too few for the current analysis. *The 'ever deployed' are soldiers in the TELIC cohort plus participants sampled as era cohort, but who had deployed to later TELIC ops at the time of questionnaire completion.


## Open access


# US Army male and female soldiers

In 2018, US Army soldiers from one brigade stationed in Europe were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire as a part of a larger study. Data from soldiers with complete AUDIT data were included in these analyses (1444 males and 90 females).


## Measures

All questionnaires completed by the Canadian, UK and US soldiers included the AUDIT.


## The AUDIT

The AUDIT consists of 10 items assessing frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption, as well as episodes of binge drinking (three items), symptoms of alcohol dependence (three items) and harmful social and health consequences of alcohol use (four items). 27 The total AUDIT score ranges from 0 to 40. The complete list of full AUDIT items and response categories can be found in online supplemental table 1.

The AUDIT-C The first three items of the 10-item AUDIT (online supplemental table 1), which assesses levels of alcohol consumption, are used for computing the AUDIT-C scores. 28 The total AUDIT-C score ranges from 0 to 12. The first item, 'How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?', response options range from 'never=0' to 'four or more times a week=4'. The second item inquires 'How many drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when you are drinking?' with responses for the Canadian and US surveys ranging from 'none or 0 drinks=0' or '1 or 2 drinks=0' to '10 or more=4'. This question in the UK surveys was modified to (a) replace 'drinks' with 'units of alcohol' and (b) replace the '10 or more' response option with additional categories of '10-14', '15-19', '20-39' and '40 or more' in order to minimise social desirability bias for soldiers feeling less inclined to check the highest response of '10 or more' (online supplemental table 1). These additional categories were also scored as 4. Item three asked 'How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion' in the Canadian and US surveys. In the UK surveys, the term 'drinks' has been replaced with 'units'; the response options for this question across all surveys ranged from 'never' to 'daily or almost daily' (online supplemental table 1).


## Measure of recent alcohol consumption for sensitivity analyses

An additional question on alcohol consumption in the 2002 US study queried 'During the past week, how many alcoholic drinks have you had?'. Based on established guidelines, 47-49 male soldiers who reported consuming greater than 14 standard alcoholic drinks per week met the threshold for risky/hazardous alcohol use. Serving as an independent measure of recent alcohol consumption, this single item facilitated sensitivity analyses regarding optimal AUDIT-C cut-point in the sample of US Amy male soldiers. None of the other study samples contained independent measures of alcohol use.


## Analyses

The 10-item AUDIT cut-points of ≥8 (for men) and ≥7 (for women) to screen for hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and ≥16 to screen for high levels of alcohol problems, served as the benchmarks against which AUDIT-C cut-points were evaluated. First, the prevalence estimates of alcohol-related problems for various cut-points of the AUDIT-C were compared with the prevalence at the 10-item AUDIT thresholds to determine cut-points that provided similar estimates across the two measures. Next, sensitivity and specificity for each AUDIT-C cut-point were calculated against the two 10-item AUDIT benchmarks to determine how well the AUDIT-C performed in identifying soldiers with or without alcohol-related problems. Positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated to determine the proportion of true positives and true negatives for each cut-point of the AUDIT-C. Diagnostic accuracy was computed to determine the ability of the AUDIT-C at each cut-point to correctly identify or rule out excessive alcohol use at each benchmark. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed to assess the performance of different AUDIT-C cut-points, to identify optimal thresholds that maximises sensitivity and specificity for hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and for high levels of alcohol problems. For sensitivity analyses, an independent measure of recent alcohol use, which was only available in the US 2002 data, was used. For this purpose, all above-mentioned analyses were repeated. IBM SPSS Statistics V.24 and STATA V.16 were used for the analyses.


## RESULTS


## Sociodemographic characteristics

The samples differed in their demographic characteristics, with UK and Canadian samples reflecting a more seasoned senior enlisted and officers, whereas the US samples came from infantry units with a higher proportion of junior enlisted soldiers (table 1). Greater than 90% of all samples were males. In the two US studies, soldiers were predominantly aged 17-24 years, whereas Canadian and UK soldiers were mainly aged ≥30 years. The majority of US soldiers were junior enlisted, whereas most Canadian and UK soldiers were non-commissioned officers. The majority of soldiers in the two US studies had never deployed, whereas most Canadian and UK soldiers had deployed one or more times for either combat or peace-keeping missions.

Patterns of alcohol consumption according to AUDIT-C Based on conventional AUDIT-C scoring standards of ≥4 for men and ≥3 for women, between 60% and 93% of male (table 2A-D.1), and 60% and 92% of female soldiers (table 3A-C) met the threshold for hazardous drinking across the three nations.

At the item level, between 87% and 99% across the samples reported some level of alcohol consumption. Prevalence of 'hazardous and harmful alcohol use', 'high levels of alcohol problems' and 'excess alcohol consumption in prior week' Using the 10-item AUDIT scoring criteria, 21.5%-70% of male soldiers across the samples met the threshold for hazardous and harmful alcohol use (table 2A-D.1). Among female soldiers, the prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking ranged from 17%-63% across nations (table 3A-C). Based on the AUDIT score of ≥16, 3%-18% of male soldiers and 1.5%-12% of female soldiers across the samples met the threshold for high levels of alcohol problems (online supplemental tables 2-5 for males and online supplemental tables 6-8 for females).


## Open access

Finally, in the US 2002 sample where an independent measure of alcohol consumption was available, 17% of Table 3 Calibrating AUDIT-C against AUDIT >=7 to screen for hazardous and harmful alcohol use among female soldiers Open access male soldiers reported consuming greater than 14 alcoholic drinks during the prior week (table 2D.2).


## AUDIT-C calibration for male soldiers

Analyses of the four datasets for male soldiers indicated that the conventional AUDIT-C score of ≥4 for men substantially overestimated the prevalence of hazardous and harmful alcohol use, when contrasted against the AUDIT cut-point of ≥8 (table 2A-D.1). Additionally, across samples, while the sensitivity was above 96%, specificity ranged between 23% and 59%. The diagnostic accuracy ranged from 0.57 to 0.77, and AUCs were between 0.61 and 0.78 (table 2A-D.1).

In contrast to the conventional cut-points, AUDIT-C cutpoints of ≥6/7 demonstrated strong overall performance and comparable prevalence with the AUDIT score of ≥8 for hazardous and harmful alcohol use (table 2A-D.1). At these cut-points, the sensitivity and specificity were nearly balanced, the diagnostic accuracy was above 0.86, with high AUC of 0.85-0.87 (table 2A-D.1). Moreover, these cut-points performed well even though the prevalence of hazardous and harmful alcohol use varied appreciably across the study samples. Based on sensitivity analyses conducted using 2002 US sample of male soldiers, the AUDIT-C cut-point of ≥7 also performed well when compared against the independent measure of past week excessive alcohol consumption (table 2D.2).

Arriving at an optimal AUDIT-C cut-point for screening high levels of alcohol problems, calibrated against an AUDIT cut-point of ≥16, varied specifically for the UK sample (online supplemental tables 2-5). In general, however, the overall diagnostic efficiency of AUDIT-C cut-point ≥8/9 was fair to good, and sensitivity and specificity relatively balanced. Although inflated AUDIT-Cderived prevalence estimates and low PPVs for high levels of alcohol problems were observed when compared with AUDIT ≥16derived prevalence estimates (online supplemental tables 2-5).


## AUDIT-C calibration for female soldiers

When calibrated against the AUDIT score of ≥7, the conventional AUDIT-C score of ≥3 for women substantially overestimated the prevalence of hazardous and harmful alcohol use among female soldiers (table 3A-C). The sensitivity ranged between 88% and 100%, while specificity ranged between 21% and 51%. The diagnostic accuracy ranged from 0.53 to 0.71, and AUCs were between 0.60 and 0.71.

Among female soldiers, the optimal AUDIT-C cut-point ranged between ≥5/6 and yielded comparable prevalence estimates for hazardous and harmful alcohol use, relative to the 10-item AUDIT score of ≥7. The AUDIT-C cut-point of ≥5/6 performed well especially in Canadian and UK samples where the sample sizes were large (table 3A-C). At these optimal AUDIT-C cut-points, the sensitivity and specificity were nearly balanced, the diagnostic accuracy was greater than 0.86 and AUC was above 0.80. Moreover, these cut-points performed well even though the prevalence of hazardous and harmful alcohol use varied across the Army samples (table 3A-C).

Among female soldiers, the AUDIT-C cut-points of ≥8/9 performed fair to good for screening high levels of alcohol problems, when calibrated against AUDIT ≥16 in the Canadian and UK samples; the AUC ranged between 0.78 and 0.86 (online supplemental tables [6][7][8]. At these cut-points, the AUDIT-C-derived prevalence estimates for high levels of alcohol problems in the UK sample were particularly inflated when benchmarked against AUDIT ≥16derived prevalence estimates, and PPVs were low.


## DISCUSSION

This is the first known study to assess the optimal cutpoints on the AUDIT-C for screening hazardous and harmful alcohol use and higher levels of alcohol problems among large international samples of serving soldiers. Analyses indicated that the conventional cut-points of ≥3 for women and ≥4 for men on the AUDIT-C 28-30 would lead to grossly inflated prevalence of hazardous and harmful alcohol use among Army populations included in this study. Misclassification of alcohol-related problems could pose major health, interpersonal and occupational challenges for military SMs. At the macro-level, misclassification could result in suboptimal policies, resource allocation and place undue burden on the military and veteran healthcare system(s).

Across the three nations, AUDIT-C cut-points of ≥6/7 for male and ≥5/6 for female soldiers were optimal for detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and for providing prevalence estimates comparable to the 10-item AUDIT cut-points of ≥8 (for men) and ≥7 (for women). Based on sensitivity analyses, the optimal performance of the AUDIT-C cut-point of ≥6/7 among male soldiers was also corroborated when tested against an independent measure of recent alcohol use. Importantly, although the prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking varied considerably across samples, similar optimal AUDIT-C scores were ascertained. For each of the sex-specific optimal ranges, the purpose of the test could be considered in selecting an appropriate cut-off. 50 For example, a lower cut-point of 5 for women and 6 for men may be used when greater sensitivity is warranted (eg, universal screening or screening in primary care that is followed by second-stage screening with greater specificity), while the cut-point of 6 for women and 7 for men could be used when greater specificity may be appropriate (eg, researchderived prevalence estimates or specialty mental healthcare settings). An AUDIT-C cut-point of ≥8/9 for both men and women provided an adequate screen for higher levels of alcohol problems. Our study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that traditional AUDIT-C screening cut-offs may be too low for some populations.

In placing these recommended cut-points in context, it is important to note that the 10-item AUDIT was primarily designed to screen for excessive drinking that could evolve into problematic alcohol use behaviours, including hazardous Open access or harmful drinking or AUD. 27 Hazardous drinking entails patterns of alcohol use that could potentially increase risk of negative experiences for the individual or others, while harmful use involves patterns of alcohol consumption that can result in adverse physical, mental and social consequences for the individual. 27 AUD involves "a problematic pattern of alcohol use" and consequent behaviours that can lead to "clinically significant impairment or distress" for the individual. 51 The higher 10-item AUDIT scores are indicative of greater severity of alcohol-related problems, and greater risk for possible AUD. 27 The AUDIT-C, which contains only the alcohol consumption items of the AUDIT, appears to be an effective screener for detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use in this study and others. 28 33-36 Using the AUDIT-C as a screening tool for higher levels of alcohol problems, however, may include substantial proportion of false positives since the majority of those who consume more than the recommended amount of alcohol do not develop an AUD. For example, Esser and colleagues found that the prevalence of alcohol dependence was about 10% among excessive as well as binge drinkers, and 1.3% among non-binge drinkers. 52 Thus, relying solely on measures of alcohol consumption for detecting possible AUD is not recommended.

Both the AUDIT and the AUDIT-C are intended as screening instruments and not diagnostic tools. Both identify individuals who engage in hazardous drinking behaviours and are at risk for developing AUD, but this does not mean that all individuals who meet or exceed recommended cutpoints will experience health issues or other adverse consequences of alcohol consumption. Whether these measures are used in clinical settings, population surveillance or epidemiologic or survey research, a follow-up clinical evaluation may be warranted. Clinical judgement should not be guided solely by AUDIT or AUDIT-C scores.


## Strengths and limitations

The present study was a collaboration across Canadian, UK and US research teams, using data from four samples of Army soldiers collected between 2002 and 2018 to arrive at optimal sex-specific AUDIT-C cut-points for detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use among male and female soldiers. Despite differences in data collection time, location, deployment status, demographic characteristics and prevalence of alcohol use-related problems across samples, results consistently indicated AUDIT-C cut-points of ≥6/7 for male and ≥5/6 for female soldiers as optimal for detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use. The AUDIT-C cut-point ≥8/9 for both male and female soldiers performed adequately for screening high levels of alcohol problems that could possibly progress to AUD.

There are several limitations to be considered. First, the AUDIT-C is a 3-item subset of the 10-item AUDIT; therefore, these two measures were not independent from one another. To mitigate lack of independence of these two measures, we used an alternate measure of recent alcohol use for sensitivity analyses that was independent of the AUDIT, which closely corroborated the overall findings. However, the study lacked an independent gold standard, such as a clinician interview, to confirm hazardous and harmful alcohol use, abuse or dependence.

Second, although data from the US 2018 study were collected anonymously, the Canadian, UK and US 2002 data were confidential but not anonymous. Therefore, some respondents may have been reluctant to disclose the extent of their alcohol use on the questionnaires due to fear of stigma or potential career repercussions. 53 However, we obtained comparable findings in both the anonymous and non-anonymous data, which gives us some confidence that the lack of anonymity had minimal effect.

Third, the data sources differed considerably in demographics and methodological approaches. Two of the samples were representative of total deployed Canadian and UK populations at the time of data collection, whereas the two US studies reflected non-random samples of individual operational units who received the full AUDIT as part of longer survey processes. However, despite the differences in sampling methods and demographics, the study findings were highly comparable across the four samples, suggesting that the findings are broadly generalisable in Army populations. Further research may be needed to determine whether the cut-points found in this study are appropriate for older populations, including veterans.

Fourth, the main objectives of military policies on alcohol use screening and soldiers' diagnosis of AUD are to limit consumption of alcohol to maintain optimal performance and operational readiness, and also to reduce rates of alcohol-related problems among SMs. Regardless of policyrelated variations across the countries, findings on optimal AUDIT-C cut-points remained consistent. Findings across samples repeatedly demonstrated that lower cut-points on the AUDIT-C, when calibrated against AUDIT cut-points ≥8/7, performed less than optimal with regards to specificity, accuracy, AUC and PPV.

Fifth, given the age of the data, findings may not be representative of current patterns of alcohol consumption in each of the Armies. However, at least one data set was from 2018 and showed consistent results.

Sixth, the number of female soldiers in the US samples were too small. Although the Canadian and UK studies contained sufficient sample size, and the results were consistent with the findings of previous studies, 28-30 33-39 it is still important to corroborate these findings with larger samples of female SMs, particularly in the US.

Seventh, the updated thresholds for binge drinking have changed to the consumption of five or more alcoholic drinks for men, and four or more for women on one occasion. 54 In all the data collected across the three nations, however, we used the more conservative original binge drinking threshold of six or more alcoholic drinks on one occasion for both males and females, based on the original WHO recommendations (2001). Further research is needed comparing screening scores with independent gold standard measure(s) in serving military populations.

Eight, the definition of standard drink generally varies in different countries. According to the WHO AUDIT Guidelines for Use in Primary Care, a standard drink in Canada contains 13.6 g of pure alcohol, in the UK 8 g and in the US 14 g. The Canadian and UK surveys included examples of serving sizes (displayed in online supplemental table 1), whereas the US surveys did not specify standard drink sizes, relying on soldiers' estimates regarding their typical consumption behaviours of drinking equivalent of one or more bottle(s) of beer, glass(es) of wine or shot(s) of liquor, which potentially contains 14 or more g of alcohol. Despite variations in serving sizes across the three countries, findings on optimal AUDIT-C cut-points remained consistent.

Finally, although soldiers in each of the four samples may be considered relatively healthy since they were in various stages of deployment, it is conceivable that prevalence of mental disorders in these samples could bias prevalence estimates for hazardous and harmful alcohol use. Nevertheless, replication of the findings across four large and very different samples with varying prevalence of alcohol-related problems strengthens these results.


## CONCLUSION

The AUDIT-C was found to be an effective screener for detecting hazardous and harmful drinking behaviours among men and women in both civilian and veteran populations. [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39] This study provides valuable information regarding the AUDIT-C cut-points of ≥6/7 for men and ≥5/6 for women as optimal for detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use among serving soldiers across three nations, and a cut-off of ≥8/9 for both men and women for detecting higher levels of alcohol problems. As a whole, findings can be informative for population surveillance, clinical practice, research and pre-deployment and post-deployment screenings where a number of mental health issues must be assessed and brief measures are most practical.

The study results are important to motivate additional research with population-based samples in each country to determine if these optimised sex-specific AUDIT-C cutpoints can be replicated in more recent Army samples, other branches of the military, as well as civilian populations. Also, a critical line of research would be to validate both AUDIT and AUDIT-C scores against independent gold standards in serving military samples.
