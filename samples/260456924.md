15Introduction Despite improved access to modern contraceptives in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the 16 region has the highest fertility rate. Although modern contraceptive usage and its determinants in 17 SSA have been assessed, most authors were not guided by behavioral change theories. This study 18 sought to assess the modern contraceptive coverage in SSA and identify the theory-based19determinants that need to be considered in demand creation interventions.20Methods Data was obtained from the most recent demographic and health surveys conducted 21 across 37 countries in SSA. Estimates of country-specific and pooled Regional modern 22 contraceptive coverage were generated from 501,324 responses. Logistic regression was used to 23 assess the relationship between modern contraceptive use and determinants selected based on the 24 Health Belief and Social-Ecological behavior change models. 25 Results Modern contraceptive coverage in SSA was 22.26% (95% CI: 17.91, 26.60). The health 26 belief model determinants of modern contraceptive use included last birth by caesarian section 27 (AOR=1.44, 95% CI:1.31,1.59), hearing of family planning at the health facility (AOR=1.18, 95% 28 CI:1.12,1.24), or from at least one media source, being able to negotiate condom use (AOR=1.65, 29 95% CI: 1.55,1.76), and having a previous terminated pregnancy (AOR=0.76, 95%CI: 0.71, 0.81).30The social ecological model determinants of modern contraceptive use included being above 24 31 years, having at least primary education, non-urgent need for a last child, and being involved in 32 decision-making concerning personal health (AOR=1.81,95% CI:1.71,1.92).33Discussion Modern contraceptive coverage in SSA is low. Age, educational status, past obstetric 34 history, exposure to family planning information, ability to negotiate condom use or make personal 35 health-related decisions, and the need for a child were the determinants for modern contraceptive 36 use in the region. Countries need to develop context-specific interventions considering these .

Although access to modern 61 contraceptives has improved in several SSA countries since 1990, researchers assessing factors 62 contributing to their differential use were not guided by behavioral change theories in selecting 63 the determinants[17,18]. However, several theories have served as frameworks to predict 64 contraceptive behavior among different populations. One of the first to be used is the Health 65 belief model (HBM), which relies on cognitive factors oriented toward goal attainment (i.e., 66 motivation to prevent pregnancy) [17]. 67 The constructs of the HBM concerning modern contraceptive use include perceived vulnerability 68 to pregnancy and its complications, perceived threats or challenges if pregnancy occurs, perceived 69 benefits in preventing pregnancy, perceived barriers to contraception, cues to action for 70 contraceptive use, and self-efficacy in the use of modern contraceptives[17,19]. 71 However, the HBM is limited in its predictive abilities because it fails to account for people's 72 individual, economic, and environmental factors in determining decisions to adopt behaviors. To 73 account for these factors, the Social Ecological Model (SEM) has been recommended for use 74 together with the HBM constructs by authors in Social Psychology[17,18].75The SEM has four constructs that assess behavioral influences at the individual, interpersonal, 76 community, and societal levels [20]. Crosby has demonstrated that age, marital and socio-economic 77 status, level of education, and personal fertility desires greatly influence contraceptive use at the 78 individual level [21]. At the interpersonal level, Fisseha found the power relations between the 79 couple, the husband's attitude, and opposition to contraceptive use to play a role, while the type of .

Its responses included no method, folkloric, traditional, and modern methods. Male and 107 female sterilization, the contraceptive pill, intrauterine contraceptive device, injectable, implants, 108 male and female condoms, the diaphragm, contraceptive foam and jelly, lactational amenorrhea, 109 standard days method, and other country-specific modern methods aside abortion and menstrual 110 regulation were classified as modern. The traditional ones include periodic abstinence and 111 withdrawal methods, while the folkloric ones involve using herbs, amulets, and other spiritual 112 approaches.113Respondents who reported using modern contraceptives were coded as '1', and those using the 114 folkloric, traditional, and no methods were coded as '0'. 115 194 ** p> 0.05 , 1= reference category 195 196Among the HBM variables, women whose last birth was by caesarian section were 1.44 times 197 more likely to use a modern contraceptive than those who did not have a caesarian section 198 (AOR=1.44, 95% CI:1.31,1.59).

At the societal level, women's empowerment 81 and access to contraceptives were noticed by Paul to determine contraceptive use [23]. 82 Although a combination of the HBM and SEM constructs provides a comprehensive list of 83 determinants for contraceptive behavior, their use in identifying determinants of modern 84 contraceptive use in SSA has not been documented. Therefore, the authors sought to assess the 85 modern contraceptive coverage and identify the theory-based determinants of their use in SSA.  larger EA is more likely to be selected than a smaller one. A pre-determined number of households 99 are selected from each EA in the second stage. Eligible participants in those households (women 100 aged 15 to 49 years and men 15 to 59 years) are then interviewed on various topics using 101 comparable questionnaires across countries" [25]. For all 37 countries, data from Individual 102 Recode (IR) file was used in the analysis.

Some of the variables were recoded to aid analysis. A new variable was created to determine the 119 number of media sources from which respondents receive family planning information. Row totals 120 of variables seeking to determine if respondents had heard of family planning on radio, TV, or in 121 a newspaper were obtained for each respondent and coded as found in table 1.

The study sought to find the pooled prevalence of modern contraceptive coverage and its 228 determinants among women in fertility age in SSA. The pooled prevalence was 22.26%. With 229 respect to the determinants, women in fertility age (WIFA) who are more than 24 years and have 230 a minimum of primary education were more likely to use modern contraceptives. Last birth by 231 caesarian section, being exposed to family planning information on at least one media source or at 232 the health facility, and the ability to negotiate condom use were also found to increase modern 233 contraceptive use. WIFA who had no urgent need for a last child were more likely to use modern 234 contraceptives than those who needed one urgently. Finally, those involved in decision-making 235 concerning their health were more likely to use modern contraceptives than those not involved.


## 236

Being the second most populous and the region with the fastest-growing population, the low 237 coverage of modern contraceptives is of significant concern because only Namibia nearly met the 238 global SDG 3.7.1 thresholds of at least 50% modern contraceptive coverage among WIFA [26].


## 239

For the region to achieve its growth potential and harness all its resources for development, Aliyu 240 calls for modern contraceptives to be vigorously promoted, not only for their demographic 241 dividends but also for their socio-economic and health-related benefits that will accelerate the 242 attainment of the sustainable development goals [27]. Evidence, however, needs to be used to guide 243 the contraceptive promotion process, and the theory-based determinants identified in the study can 244 serve as a good starting point.

44 use, waste production, and environmental degradation[1], and hindering the achievement of all the 45 17 sustainable development goals(SDG), especially in developing countries[2]. Although family 46 planning is to help limit this growth, unintended pregnancies are still prevalent and leading to very 47 poor outcomes across the globe[3-5]. Between 2015 and 2019, approximately 121 million 48 unintended pregnancies occurred globally each year, with about a third of them ending in 49 abortions[6]. Despite a general decline in unintended pregnancies since 1990, it remains high in 50 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [7]. 51 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the second most populous region with the highest fertility rate (4.4 52 children) and yearly increase in population (2.49%)[8,9]. Between 2013 and 2016, an average of 53 14 million unintended pregnancies were recorded annually[7] in the region, some of which were 54 attributed to low socio-economic status, coerced contraceptive decision-making and failure of 55 family planning methods[6,10-13]. To reduce the failure rates, the correct and consistent use of 56 modern contraceptives has been recommended over the traditional ones due to their contraceptive 57 efficacy[4,14-16].


the study was obtained from measure DHS programme[24] after submitting a concept 90 note. The most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from 37 countries in SSA whose 91 data is available on the DHS website were included.

## "
DHS is a nationally representative household survey conducted at regular intervals to provide 94 countries with updated information on different health topics such as maternal and child health, 95 reproductive health, fertility, nutrition, mortality, and HIV/AIDS. The survey follows a two-stage 96 stratified cluster sampling design. Large geographic areas are selected as enumeration areas(EA) 97 in the first stage through the Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) approach, where a relatively 98

are approved by Inner City Fund(ICF) international and the ethical review boards of 155 respective countries to ensure that the protocols comply with the United States Department of 156 Health and Human Service regulations to protect human subjects[24]. This study involved 157 secondary data analysis with no client contact.


surveys were conducted from 1990 to 2019, with 501,324 respondents across all 162 the surveys. Most of the respondents were in the 15-24 age band (39.77%) and had up to primary 163 education (32.44%). About two-thirds of them were married (63.58%) and dwelling in rural 164 areas (62.5%), (table 2).

1Forest plot of country-specific modern contraceptive use and pooled estimate by subthe bivariate logistic regression, all the included variables in both the HBM and SEM were 182 significantly associated with modern contraceptive use. Although being married increased the odds 183 of modern contraceptive use (OR =1.68,95% CI:1.62, 1.75), it was not included in the modeling 184 due to its colinearity with multiple variables. During the multivariable logistic regression in 185 Models 1 and 2, ability to refuse sex (AOR=1.04,95% CI: 0.98,1.12), being in wealth index 186 (Middle AOR=0.99,95% CI:0.87,1.14) and Rich (AOR=1.03, 95%CI: 0.89,1.21) and involvement 187 in decision making for contraceptive use (AOR=1.05,95% CI: 0.92,1.21) were not significantly 188 associated with modern contraceptive use so were excluded from Model 3. The variables that 189 remained significant in both models are captured in table 3. All the variables in model 3, but urban 190 residence (AOR=0.98,95% CI: 0.92,1.04), were significantly associated with modern 191 contraceptive use.192


health institutions, other key stakeholders, and media organizations in order 248 to replicate the successful contribution media houses made towards family planning campaigns in 249 Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Malawi across the SSA region[28]. With the majority of these women being 250 on social media[29], there is the need to look beyond these traditional media outlets and add social 251 marketing approaches, which are relatively cheaper and have demonstrated success in several 252 campaigns within the region[30-32]. 253 Although Boniface reported that some health workers hamper the use of contraceptives through 254 their judgments of parity, religious beliefs, and other unfounded restrictions[33], evidence from 255 this study adds to previous publications that demonstrated the role of health workers in increasing 256 contraceptive coverage in the sub-region[34]. However, there have been calls for community 257 health workers to be deployed to undertake these contraceptive promotion activities within 258 communities as part of their routine work, rather than restricting them to health facilities[34]. 259 The calls to empower WIFA towards achieving the SDGs[35-37] are further strengthened by the 260 findings that those who could negotiate for condom use and those involved in decision-making 261 concerning their health were more likely to use modern contraceptives. Aside from its direct effect 262 on contraceptive use, Heera showed empowered women in urban slums to have lower rates of 263 abortion. Though Prata and colleagues did not observe any relationship between empowerment 264 and unintended pregnancies, they found empowered women to access antenatal care completely 265 have lower maternal mortality rates and delayed sexual debut among their daughters[38,39].


268 method. Contributing to this low likelihood are the cultural myths surrounding sex amongst young 269 persons and country-specific regulations concerning the legal age of consent for sex and access to 270 contraceptives[40-42]. These need to be considered in developing context-specific interventions 271 for this particular age group. To empower them, the call by SDG 4 to "ensure inclusive and 272 equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all" was found in this 273 study to be very crucial in improving modern contraceptive use. There is a need for countries to 274 ensure adherence to the provision of universal basic education, at least to the primary level, for all 275 citizens[43].


278conception for the uterine scar to heal well before the subsequent pregnancy and the introduction279 of long term methods( tubal ligation and IUCD) during the delivery process[44,45]. The findings 280 that the urgent need for the last child decreased the odds of modern contraceptive use was observed 281 by Coomson, who attributed it to the social desire to meet fertility needs and thus not only limited 282 to the SSA region[46]. 283 The decreased odds of modern contraceptive use among persons with a history of terminated 284 pregnancy in the region might point to significant service delivery gaps because it increased 285 contraceptive use in other contexts[47]. This gap is likely to be in providing comprehensive post-286 abortion care in the region. To resolve this, Corbett recommends ensuring the establishment and 287 equipping of comprehensive one-stop-shop facilities to provide abortion services, making all 288 forms of contraceptives available, and getting the whole package covered by health insurance[48].


301 sample size, making the findings generalizable primarily to the included countries. The use of 302 behavior change theories to objectively select determinants also increases the likelihood of 303 recommendations impacting contraceptive use positively. However, a causal association cannot 304 be established between modern contraceptive use and the determinants due to the cross-sectional 305 nature of the survey. Not all the countries in the region had DHS data, so the findings may also not 306 be representative of the entire SSA region.

The study sought to find the pooled prevalence of modern contraceptive coverage and its 228 determinants among women in fertility age in SSA. The pooled prevalence was 22.26%. With 229 respect to the determinants, women in fertility age (WIFA) who are more than 24 years and have 230 a minimum of primary education were more likely to use modern contraceptives. Last birth by 231 caesarian section, being exposed to family planning information on at least one media source or at 232 the health facility, and the ability to negotiate condom use were also found to increase modern 233 contraceptive use. WIFA who had no urgent need for a last child were more likely to use modern 234 contraceptives than those who needed one urgently. Finally, those involved in decision-making 235 concerning their health were more likely to use modern contraceptives than those not involved.


## 236

Being the second most populous and the region with the fastest-growing population, the low 237 coverage of modern contraceptives is of significant concern because only Namibia nearly met the 238 global SDG 3.7.1 thresholds of at least 50% modern contraceptive coverage among WIFA [26].


## 239

For the region to achieve its growth potential and harness all its resources for development, Aliyu 240 calls for modern contraceptives to be vigorously promoted, not only for their demographic 241 dividends but also for their socio-economic and health-related benefits that will accelerate the 242 attainment of the sustainable development goals [27]. Evidence, however, needs to be used to guide 243 the contraceptive promotion process, and the theory-based determinants identified in the study can 244 serve as a good starting point.

Modern contraceptive coverage in SSA is low. Age, educational status, past obstetric history, 309 exposure to family planning information, ability to negotiate condom use or make personal 310 health-related decisions, and the need for a child were the determinants for MC use in the region.

44 use, waste production, and environmental degradation[1], and hindering the achievement of all the 45 17 sustainable development goals(SDG), especially in developing countries[2]. Although family 46 planning is to help limit this growth, unintended pregnancies are still prevalent and leading to very 47 poor outcomes across the globe[3-5]. Between 2015 and 2019, approximately 121 million 48 unintended pregnancies occurred globally each year, with about a third of them ending in 49 abortions[6]. Despite a general decline in unintended pregnancies since 1990, it remains high in 50 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [7]. 51 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the second most populous region with the highest fertility rate (4.4 52 children) and yearly increase in population (2.49%)[8,9]. Between 2013 and 2016, an average of 53 14 million unintended pregnancies were recorded annually[7] in the region, some of which were 54 attributed to low socio-economic status, coerced contraceptive decision-making and failure of 55 family planning methods[6,10-13]. To reduce the failure rates, the correct and consistent use of 56 modern contraceptives has been recommended over the traditional ones due to their contraceptive 57 efficacy[4,14-16].


the study was obtained from measure DHS programme[24] after submitting a concept 90 note. The most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from 37 countries in SSA whose 91 data is available on the DHS website were included.

## "
DHS is a nationally representative household survey conducted at regular intervals to provide 94 countries with updated information on different health topics such as maternal and child health, 95 reproductive health, fertility, nutrition, mortality, and HIV/AIDS. The survey follows a two-stage 96 stratified cluster sampling design. Large geographic areas are selected as enumeration areas(EA) 97 in the first stage through the Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) approach, where a relatively 98


contained in table 1, were assessed for association with the outcome variable by conducting a bi-144 variable multilevel regression analysis, and the statistically significant ones (p≤ 0.05) were 145 considered for inclusion in their theory-specific logistic regression model. The collinearity 146


are approved by Inner City Fund(ICF) international and the ethical review boards of 155 respective countries to ensure that the protocols comply with the United States Department of 156 Health and Human Service regulations to protect human subjects[24]. This study involved 157 secondary data analysis with no client contact.


surveys were conducted from 1990 to 2019, with 501,324 respondents across all 162 the surveys. Most of the respondents were in the 15-24 age band (39.77%) and had up to primary 163 education (32.44%). About two-thirds of them were married (63.58%) and dwelling in rural 164 areas (62.5%), (table 2).

## Fig 1 .
1Forest plot of country-specific modern contraceptive use and pooled estimate by subthe bivariate logistic regression, all the included variables in both the HBM and SEM were 182 significantly associated with modern contraceptive use. Although being married increased the odds 183 of modern contraceptive use (OR =1.68,95% CI:1.62, 1.75), it was not included in the modeling 184 due to its colinearity with multiple variables. During the multivariable logistic regression in 185 Models 1 and 2, ability to refuse sex (AOR=1.04,95% CI: 0.98,1.12), being in wealth index 186 (Middle AOR=0.99,95% CI:0.87,1.14) and Rich (AOR=1.03, 95%CI: 0.89,1.21) and involvement 187 in decision making for contraceptive use (AOR=1.05,95% CI: 0.92,1.21) were not significantly 188 associated with modern contraceptive use so were excluded from Model 3. The variables that 189 remained significant in both models are captured in table 3. All the variables in model 3, but urban 190 residence (AOR=0.98,95% CI: 0.92,1.04), were significantly associated with modern 191 contraceptive use.192


health institutions, other key stakeholders, and media organizations in order 248 to replicate the successful contribution media houses made towards family planning campaigns in 249 Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Malawi across the SSA region[28]. With the majority of these women being 250 on social media[29], there is the need to look beyond these traditional media outlets and add social 251 marketing approaches, which are relatively cheaper and have demonstrated success in several 252 campaigns within the region[30-32]. 253 Although Boniface reported that some health workers hamper the use of contraceptives through 254 their judgments of parity, religious beliefs, and other unfounded restrictions[33], evidence from 255 this study adds to previous publications that demonstrated the role of health workers in increasing 256 contraceptive coverage in the sub-region[34]. However, there have been calls for community 257 health workers to be deployed to undertake these contraceptive promotion activities within 258 communities as part of their routine work, rather than restricting them to health facilities[34]. 259 The calls to empower WIFA towards achieving the SDGs[35-37] are further strengthened by the 260 findings that those who could negotiate for condom use and those involved in decision-making 261 concerning their health were more likely to use modern contraceptives. Aside from its direct effect 262 on contraceptive use, Heera showed empowered women in urban slums to have lower rates of 263 abortion. Though Prata and colleagues did not observe any relationship between empowerment 264 and unintended pregnancies, they found empowered women to access antenatal care completely 265 have lower maternal mortality rates and delayed sexual debut among their daughters[38,39].


268 method. Contributing to this low likelihood are the cultural myths surrounding sex amongst young 269 persons and country-specific regulations concerning the legal age of consent for sex and access to 270 contraceptives[40-42]. These need to be considered in developing context-specific interventions 271 for this particular age group. To empower them, the call by SDG 4 to "ensure inclusive and 272 equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all" was found in this 273 study to be very crucial in improving modern contraceptive use. There is a need for countries to 274 ensure adherence to the provision of universal basic education, at least to the primary level, for all 275 citizens[43].


278conception for the uterine scar to heal well before the subsequent pregnancy and the introduction279 of long term methods( tubal ligation and IUCD) during the delivery process[44,45]. The findings 280 that the urgent need for the last child decreased the odds of modern contraceptive use was observed 281 by Coomson, who attributed it to the social desire to meet fertility needs and thus not only limited 282 to the SSA region[46]. 283 The decreased odds of modern contraceptive use among persons with a history of terminated 284 pregnancy in the region might point to significant service delivery gaps because it increased 285 contraceptive use in other contexts[47]. This gap is likely to be in providing comprehensive post-286 abortion care in the region. To resolve this, Corbett recommends ensuring the establishment and 287 equipping of comprehensive one-stop-shop facilities to provide abortion services, making all 288 forms of contraceptives available, and getting the whole package covered by health insurance[48].


301 sample size, making the findings generalizable primarily to the included countries. The use of 302 behavior change theories to objectively select determinants also increases the likelihood of 303 recommendations impacting contraceptive use positively. However, a causal association cannot 304 be established between modern contraceptive use and the determinants due to the cross-sectional 305 nature of the survey. Not all the countries in the region had DHS data, so the findings may also not 306 be representative of the entire SSA region.

Although urban residence has been shown to increase modern contraceptive use in several settings[49,50], its failure to significantly impact modern contraceptive use in the final model needs to be investigated further. However, it might be because most (62.5%) respondents were from rural dwellings.;
