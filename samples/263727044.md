Real estate majorly contributes to the national gross domestic product (GDP) growth, occupying an important position in the national economy.It is the largest fixed asset for households.The real estate market is associated with a wide range of economic aspects with more upstream and downstream enterprises.Simultaneously, the factors affecting the real estate market are complex and variable.Fluctuations in the real estate market affect the entire economic system.This requires the government to formulate relevant housing policies to stabilize the operation of the real estate market.Therefore, it is meaningful to study the impact of housing policies on the real estate market and provide reasonable opinions for the housing sector in formulating policies.This study adopts a systematic quantitative literature review to examine the impact of housing policies on the real estate market.This study finds that housing policies affecting the real estate market can be divided into the following three categories: monetary, tax, and macro-prudential policies.Changes in supply and demand in the real estate market primarily reflect the effectiveness of policies, with housing price factors as the transmission mechanism.Furthermore, the influence of housing policies from different countries and regions on real estate market factors is compared to provide a reference for scholars to pursue further study.

## Introduction

Real estate occupies an important position in the financial module [1][2][3] and is an integral part of the national economy [4,5].Housing is regarded as the most important collateral and consumer commodity in the economy [6,7] and largest fixed asset of a family that can affect the family's savings and consumption decisions to a large extent [8].Therefore, the real estate market has always been considered a good investment opportunity [9].From a macro perspective, real estate plays a core role in the GDP growth of every country [10].The upstream and downstream industries of real estate are numerous and complex, with a wide range of related economic levels that stimulate the development of other industries [11].Additionally, most enterprises and families own real estate and the construction industry is an important part of the real economy [12].Therefore, when real estate prices fluctuate over a wide range, their impact may spread to the entire economic system and have a huge impact on society.This requires the economy to ensure the sound development of the real estate market.Research shows that stability in the real estate market is essential to ensure citizens' social security and economic stability [13] Simultaneously, a developed housing sector that maintains the stability of the real estate market is considered one of the main tasks for achieving long-term economic growth [14].

Many factors cause housing price fluctuations and the differences in real estate characteristics are relatively large.The real estate market allows any scale of investment that depends on investor demand and risk characteristics; therefore, it is difficult to identify the risk factors in the real estate market [15].The stable operation of a real estate economic system requires two hands of control, one is the invisible hand of the market and other is the visible hand of the government [16].When growing housing demand meets short-term inelastic housing supply in the real estate market, housing prices rise and hamper market stability.Many construction projects and home purchases are financed with credit provided by leveraged lenders; hence, a sharp drop in real estate prices could lead to defaults by those borrowers.The impact of these defaults can be amplified by the deleveraging process of lenders who have lost money because of defaulting, potentially causing a deeper economic crisis [17].At this time, the government's visible hand is needed to formulate relevant housing policies to regulate the stable operation of the real estate market [18].

Understanding the effect of housing policies on the real estate market can help governments and policymakers assess the effectiveness and feasibility of such policies.Studying and evaluating past policies can provide lessons and references for future policymaking.Studying the impact of housing policies on the real estate market is helpful for formulating policies conducive to economic growth and financial stability, while avoiding potential risks and fluctuations.The healthy development of the real estate market is greatly important for the sustainable development of society and the economy.Studying the impacts of housing policies from an international perspective can help different countries exchange experiences, learn from policies, and promote policy coordination and cooperation.This helps solve common housing problems, jointly address challenges, and promote innovation and progress in housing policies; Studying the impact of housing policies on the real estate market can help investors and capital market participants understand the changes and effects of policies and improve capital allocation and investment decisions.In summary, studying the impact of housing policies on the real estate market helps us understand the interaction and relationship between policy and the market.This provides guidance to government and decision-makers formulating effective policies and promotes sustainable development, economic growth, and international cooperation.In the context of globalization, research from an international perspective can promote the exchange of experiences and common development between countries, promoting progress and innovation in the field of housing.

This study aims to discover the impact of housing policies on the real estate market using existing data.Accordingly, we analyze the changes in the real estate market after the implementation of housing policies and compare the heterogeneity of the impact of policies in the real estate markets of different countries.Thus, it provides references for policymakers in the housing sector and reveals new avenues for future research.The remainder of this study is organized as follows.Section 2 explains the methods and processes used, and Section 3 presents the results of the literature review.Section 4 discusses the literature findings and knowledge in this field, and Section 5 concludes the study.


## Research method

To comprehensively report on the current research, we set the following four research objectives: (1) To identify the types and influencing factors of policies affecting the real estate market.(2) To analyze core changes in housing prices after the implementation of housing policies.(3) To compare the similarities and differences in the literature on the impact of housing policies on the real estate markets from different periods, countries, research methods, and themes.(4) Based on the identified knowledge gaps, several directions that can open new approaches for future research are proposed.


### Retrieval strategy

This study adopts a systematic quantitative literature review method [19,20] to search and categorize the literature, which provides a repeatable and reliable assessment of the current state of the field of study.How papers are found, selected, and classified is articulated, minimizing the potential bias that emerges in some narrative-style reviews [21].The resulting quantitative assessment documents the geographical distribution of the literature, types of methods used, and types of results obtained.

Combined with relevant literature, the keywords used in the literature search include "policy," "real estate," "housing price," "housing policy," "government," "economy," and "tax."The search rules used are for English literature in which the keywords appear in the titles and abstracts.Using a two-way "snowball" technique, we backtrack all references reported in identified articles and forward through Google Academic to find all articles citing the original article.

The journal period was set from 2012 to 2022.Considering that many countries and regions have experienced adjustments and evolutions in housing policies following the 2008 financial crisis, it is important to examine the research between 2012 and 2022 to understand governmental decisions and reforms in response to housing market challenges.Moreover, during this period, the socioeconomic, technological, and environmental factors significantly changed.Housing policies also require corresponding adjustments and innovations considering the development of The Times.Furthermore, selecting articles from the past 10 years can provide the latest research results and data to reflect current housing policies and changes in the real estate market.This can provide the most accurate real-time information and reflect the implementation and effects of policy measures.Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Academic electronic databases were used to conduct an extensive online literature search.The first step was a preliminary screening of the titles and abstracts of articles.The reference tables for the inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1.


### Literature screening and data extraction

Literature screening and data extraction were carried out by two researchers, and a third researcher assisted in judgment when there was disagreement and it was impossible to reach unity.If the information or the full text was missing, the author was contacted.First, duplicate references were screened using Endnote.Next, the titles and abstracts of the references were initially screened to exclude irrelevant references, and the full text was re-screened, the article content, main title, and sub-title were filtered for the second time, and the re-screened standard reference (Table 2) was used to determine the included references.The data extraction content included the author, publication time, research object, sample size, research design, phenomena of interest, and evaluation content.


### Literature quality evaluation

According to the criteria listed in Table 3 [22], two researchers independently evaluated the quality of the included studies using quality evaluation standards.In cases of disagreement or failure to reach unity, three researchers were assigned to assist with the judgment.A total of 10 contents were evaluated and each item was evaluated by "yes," "no," or "unclear."All the aforementioned criteria met level A, indicating the least possibility of bias.Partial satisfaction implied level B, indicating a moderate possibility of bias.Grade C was unsatisfactory, indicating a high possibility of bias.Grade C literature was excluded.


### Literature retrieval process

The number of articles collected from the Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Academic electronic databases was recorded in the Web of Science.Among them, Web of Science recorded 824 articles, Google Academic electronic database recorded 337, and ProQuest recorded 81.A total of 1242 studies were identified as the dataset for this study, and 871 articles were initially screened.According to the criteria in Table 2, after conducting a screening process with three people, 462 studies were classified as irrelevant literature and removed.Finally, 45 papers were selected for the literature review, following quality evaluation.The literature screening process is illustrated in Fig. 1.

The following information from each research paper was recorded in the database: author, affiliated institution, journal name, year of publication, geographical location studied, subject and direction studied, research methods used, policy classification of the study, real estate market factors studied, and results of the policy impact on the real estate market.


## Result

A total of 45 original, peer-reviewed research papers on the impact of policies on the housing market were identified (Annex 1).The selected papers were briefly analyzed.As shown in Fig. 2, various scholars have studied the impact of policies on the real estate market from 2012 to 2022.Especially after 2020, the number of published papers steadily increased, indicating that under the impact of the epidemic, an increasing number of scholars began studying the effect of policies on the real estate market to provide references for policymakers.


### Geographic distribution of studies

The impacts of these policies on the housing market have attracted academic interest worldwide (Table 4).Studies have been conducted in countries on all continents, mainly Europe (35.56 %), but also other continents, including Asia (26.67 %), North America

### Methods of housing policy research studies

Scholars have used various methods to clarify the transmission mechanisms of policies on real estate (Table 6).Extensive methods have been used to identify the impacts of policies on the housing market.Most studies have adopted econometric methods.However, some scholars have adopted the vector auto-regression (VAR) model l7, with some differences between their models; for example [28], used Markov Switching Vector Auto Regression (MSVAR) models [29], used a time-varying vector auto-regressive model, and [30,31] used a factor-augmented vector auto-regressive (FAVAR) model.Some scholars have adopted the general equilibrium model in five articles, difference-in-differences model in four articles, and regression model in three articles.Other quantitative models used to study the impacts of policies on the real estate market include the symmetric thermal optimal path (TOPS) method [23] and structural break models [32].


### Housing policy analysis and evaluation of studies

After analyzing the 45 papers, we divided the results based on the effectiveness of the policies on the real estate market, tools of policy impact on the real estate market, spillover effect of policies on the real estate market, regional heterogeneity of policy impact on the real estate market, and impact of policies on the real estate market bubble, as shown in Table 7.

Among the 45 studies, 25 discussed the effectiveness of policies on the housing market, and six of them examined the effectiveness of the monetary policy [33] The impact of the money supply expansion has stimulated the property sector, but only in the short-term, with little impact on prices [28].Expansionary monetary policy shocks have significant effects only during normal economic periods [31].Monetary policy shocks have lasting effects on housing prices and property wealth [23].Aggressive monetary policy forcefully intervenes in the housing market [34].Loose monetary conditions can lead to surges in property lending and housing bubbles [35].The expansionary monetary policy affects the Italian economy.Housing policies have positive impacts on the real economy, real estate (RE) output as a commodity, value-added, and pricing.

Six studies examined the effectiveness of tax policies [36].Real estate tax is effective in the short term but not in the long term [37].The welfare costs of introducing or eliminating housing transaction taxes are low [38].Residential property taxes and higher interest rates have effectively discouraged speculative housing transactions and have had a long-term effect on house price taming [26].Stricter enforcement of land taxes reduces the impact of boom-and-bust dynamics in the property market [39].To curb soaring house

Australian house prices are mainly driven by four key factors, namely, mortgage rates, consumer sentiment, stock market indices, and unemployment Reduce credit availability and leverage to ease the housing price cycle Borrower-based regulatory policies, such as reducing LTV or DTI limits, can effectively curb housing booms The increase in house price is positively correlated with the change in demand for a residential mortgage loan Higher interest rates, slower money supply growth, and tighter mortgage down-payment policies tend to slow down subsequent house price growth Property tax is a factor that can determine the recovery of property demand through moderate fluctuations Policy spillover effect

The spillover effect from the housing market is not negligible, concentrated on consumption instead of business investment 3

Housing market and economic policy uncertainty have large spillover effects on the impact on inflation, economic growth, and monetary policy stance The spillover effects between economic policy uncertainty and the housing market and earnings and volatility are stronger in the longer period than in the shorter period Regional heterogeneity of the real estate market impact

The regional heterogeneity can be partially explained by changes in housing supply, that is, where land is more expensive, house prices are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates 4

The heterogeneity of policy response is significantly correlated with the local regulatory environment and housing supply elasticity Geographical differences in policy have temporary inflationary effects real estate market bubble

The housing policy effectively restrains the rapid rise in housing prices and suppresses the real estate market bubble 3 Significant correlation exists between monetary policy and asset pricing bubbles Tighter monetary policy is associated with an increase in the REITs bubble component of the US economy Other While property taxes simply extract wealth from the original homeowner, transaction taxes can have more subtle, potentially positive effects 3

The REITs market can avoid the impact of economic policy uncertainty Real estate stimulus policies may increase banks' real estate market risk, mainly because of the impact of tax stimulus policies C. Zhao and F. Liu kept prices from rising in the short term [32].Government intervention and external shocks are the two main reasons for structural changes in China's real estate market [45].The impact of U.S. policy on global Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) stocks has significantly varied across time and countries [46].The gross value added to the construction sector sharply fell following a surprise rise in the government's cash rate [47].Mortgage policies to regulate excess demand have helped reinforce housing price growth.Using a sensitivity analysis, this study confirms that the regulation of Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to -Income (DTI) ratios has strong leverage in the housing market [48].Changes in down payment requirements effectively curbed the house-price cycle [49].With an increase in residential property prices, the absolute amount of land value acquisition has increased, but the relative proportion of land value acquisition has decreased.

Seven studies have explored the tools of policy impact on the real estate market [50].The instrument of choice for macroprudential policy has been the monthly net income of mortgage applicants [25].Australian house prices have been driven by the following four key factors: mortgage rates, consumer sentiment, the Australian stock market index, and unemployment [51].Credit availability can be reduced and leveraged to ease the housing price cycle [52].Borrower-based regulatory policies, such as lower LTV and DTI limits can effectively curb housing booms [53].The increase in house prices positively correlates with the change in demand for residential mortgage loans [54].Higher interest rates, slower money supply growth, and tighter mortgage down payment policies have slowed down subsequent housing price growth [55].Property taxes are one factor that can determine the recovery of housing demand with modest fluctuations.

Three studies have discussed regional heterogeneity in the real estate market [56].Some of this regional heterogeneity can be explained by changes in housing supply, where land is more expensive and housing prices are generally more sensitive to changes in the interest rates [30].The heterogeneity of policy responses is significantly correlated with the local regulatory environment and housing supply elasticities [41].Geographical differences in policy differences have temporary effects on inflation.

Three of the studies have examined the relationship between policy and housing bubbles [27].The housing policy has effectively restrained the rapid rise in housing prices and suppressed bubbles in the real estate market [57].There is a significant correlation between monetary policy and asset pricing bubbles [29].A tighter monetary policy is associated with an increase in the REITs bubble in the US economy.

In other studies [58], property taxes are considered to simply extract wealth from the original homeowner, whereas transaction taxes can have more subtle and potentially positive effects [59].REIT markets are insulated from economic policy uncertainty [32].Real estate stimulus policies may increase banks' real estate market risk, mainly because of the impact of tax stimulus policies.


### Housing policy classification of studies

The policy classifications are shown in Table 8.A total of 16 studies were conducted to examine the impact of monetary policy on the real estate market.The main influencing factor of monetary policies on the real estate market has been the adjustment of interest rate policies, while other factors have included money supply, bank loan channels, and mortgage loans.A total of eight studies have examined the impact of tax policies on the real estate market, according to which, various factors affecting the real estate market, including property, transfer, land, and property taxes.There are seven studies on the impact of macroprudential policies on the real estate market.Factors affecting the real estate market include the ratio of loans to income, LTV or DTI, household credit, and down payments.There were three studies on the real estate market, all of which came from the United States.A total of 11 studies have examined the impact of other policies on the real estate market, including purchase restrictions and fiscal, industrial, and land policies.


### Influence of housing policy on real estate factors of studies

The main factor affecting the real estate market was the change in housing prices, as shown in Table 9.A total of 25 studies (55.56%) used housing prices as data.Other factors were combined with housing prices to reflect market changes [53]; these includes housing prices, incomes, and residential mortgage rates [24].Regarding housing prices and credit, some scholars have studied the real

## Discussion

In this quantitative and systematic literature review, which includes 45 studies on the impact of housing policies on the real estate market, we provide an analysis and evaluation of real estate policies, analyze the important factors of housing policies in the real estate market, and compare the effects of national policies from different regions.The results are analyzed and discussed in Section 3, which is divided into three parts.


### Impact and evaluation of different housing policies

We divided housing policies into three broad categories.The first category concerns monetary policies, such as raising interest rates [60,61].The second includes tax policy tools for reducing housing demand, such as transaction, property, and mortgage interest tax deductions [62].The third category addresses macroprudential regulation, which aims to decrease the demand for housing and reduces risks to the financial system, for instance, by imposing higher capital requirements on mortgage applicants and limiting the LTV and DTI ratios [63].

Imposing a transfer tax, or lowering the LTV ratio, has a short-term effect on the housing market [38].Some researchers have studied the effect of the real estate tax pilot policy to find that the real estate tax levy has a certain effect in the short term, but is not ideal in the long term [36].The aggressive taxation of housing transactions in China can stabilize the property market [58].The benefits of introducing or eliminating a housing transaction tax in the United States are insignificant [37].A study on Estonia's real estate market has shown that a strictly enforced land tax policy can reduce the impact of property boom-bust cycles [26].Kuttneretal (2016) have analyzed the effectiveness of nine non-interest rate policies implemented across 57 economies and found that only an increase in housing-related taxes has a significant impact on housing prices [24].Considering that real estate tax is an important tax policy component, real estate tax policy implementation has a crucial impact on housing market prices and family wealth.Imposing a residential property tax or effectively raising interest rates discourages speculative housing transactions and, over time, tames house prices in the long run.

The impact of monetary policy has long been a concerning issue in the field of monetary economics.The impact of monetary policies on the real estate market has led to an increase in housing prices, which has further promoted research on monetary policies.An imbalance in the real estate market was one of the main reasons for the outbreak of the financial crisis.By observing the effect of the accumulation of imbalance in the real estate market before the financial crisis, it can be seen that the impact of monetary policy on real estate prices and real estate market has a highly significant and lasting impact [31].

The housing market has played an important role in past systemic financial crises and received significant attention from macroprudential policymakers.By refining housing policies in response to the strong volatility that the real estate credit cycle may exhibit, there is increasing theoretical support and empirical evidence that borrower-based regulatory policies may be effective.This calls for the establishment of a clear macroprudential coordination mechanism [52].The impact of macroprudential policies on housing, leasing, and mortgage markets should be studied at the aggregate and individual household levels and sub-segments, such as first-time buyers, homeowners, buy-to-let investors, and renters [51].Macroprudential policies have been effective in restraining housing prices and household credit growth in both the short and long terms [43].DSTI, DTI, and LTV instruments are now widely used in macroprudential policies in many European countries.They regulate applicants' access to the mortgage market and number of mortgages offered, based on the set criteria [50].Macroprudential policies have been effective in curbing housing inflation [42].

Regression, difference, and panel data analyses are commonly used empirical research methods to analyze the effects of housing policies.This method has been used to evaluate the effects of housing policies by collecting and analyzing real-world data.It has help to


## Table 9

### Influence of policy on various real estate factors

The divergence in local housing price responses to monetary policies can be partly explained by factors such as housing supply conditions, mortgage debt, investor concentration, and average income.This illustrates the potential transmission mechanism of monetary policy, and suggests that the state determines the effectiveness of monetary policy [56].Monetary shocks affect housing prices [30].They play an economic role in restraining housing price growth [64].An expansionary monetary policy tends to accelerate subsequent house price rises, while a restrictive monetary policy tends to slow down subsequent house price rises [54].

When the real estate market is dysfunctional, the government can effectively introduce housing policies that restrain housing prices [39].Housing prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates [34], and there exists an elastic relationship between property tax revenue and housing prices [65].Swedish house prices did not respond to large cuts in the country's property tax [40].Other recent studies have focused on public policy moderators affecting housing demand.A study conducted in Canada has examined policies that regulate mortgage-backed bonds to reduce demand and lower house prices [66].


### Influence of housing policies in different countries on the real estate market

With different development levels in the real estate market, the level of government control also changes to formulate policies for the real estate market.Europe, South America, and some Asian countries are developed, and their real estate markets are mainly follow the free-market economic system.Of course, different countries have different free-market economies, welfare levels, and government influences on real estate development.In some developing countries in Asia, government supervision and market operations are combined, and the housing marketization level is not high; therefore, the government significantly influences real estate development.There also exist large differences in each country's housing system policies.In some countries, the differences in resident income are small, degree of housing commercialization is not high, government holds significant influence on the real estate market, and housingrelated subsidies are strong.In some free welfare countries, the housing supply is dominated by the market, and the government only provides housing security to a small number of low-income groups to compensate for market failures.The government's role in guiding and regulating the market economy also differs.

Europe: Several institutional and macroeconomic factors, some specific to individual countries, affect the different performances of European housing markets.After the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, the real estate market in Germany remained stable because of a few reasons.First, the country developed a prudent monetary policy on mortgage loans, under which, bank loans were determined based on the minimum value of real estate instead of the market price; this prevented the periodicity of lending.Meanwhile, banks provided fixed-interest-rate mortgage loans to reduce the risk of default.Another country formulated policies to regulate the real estate rental market.For example, rent could not be freely raised; therefore, families did not completely rely on house purchases.This had a certain substitution effect, transferred the financial risks generated by house purchases, and helped maintain market stability [67].Similarly, in France, housing-related policies have always been an important issue for the government.To stabilize the real estate market, the government has formulated interest-free loan policies that, to some extent, have solved first-time house owners' demands.Housing policies have significant affected land prices [41].A study on the impact of national fiscal policy changes on the real estate market in Spain has used background data from 2004 to 2015 provided by real estate agents and conducted a difference-in-difference estimation for the improved identification strategy.They have considered two fiscal policies, tax credit and Value Added Taxes rate changes for new house purchases and concluded that the tax policy has a negative causal effect on the real estate market [68].

(2022) have comprehensively demonstrated the need for EU policies on housing-related issues [69].The introduction of property taxes in Italy has affected construction activities in the real estate market [32].Among the tax policies, income tax has a significant impact on the real estate market's investment demand, providing strategies for Italy to regulate the real estate market and formulate relevant fiscal policies [55].Real estate plays a significant role in the Italian economic system.A dynamic financially calculable general equilibrium model has been used to analyze the impact of monetary policy on the real estate market economy.The results show that European banks' quantitave easing policy has had a positive impact on the region's real estate market [35].

South America: Social housing policy in Chile has combined the free market principles of investment decisions with the longstanding tradition of social housing subsidies.This has prevented a more balanced development in the housing market in the grassroots population, which is dominated by demand subsidies and interest-oriented groups that profit from investments [70].The adjustment of economic policy may endanger the stability of the financial market and promote an imbalance in real estate prices [71].The Peruvian government has implemented a housing policy for the low-income class to effectively suppress housing demand in the real estate market and rise in land prices [72].In Latin America, where various housing programs and urban regulations have been tested, relaxation of housing policy measures has led to alternative management of the market, which has not been able to contain the crisis in the real estate market [73].

North America: Monetary policy has affected the US REITs sector.The tightening monetary policy has been linked to an increase in the bubble component of REITs in the US economy [29].Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) is weak in predicting the returns and volatility of US REITs, and the REITs market can hedge against EPU [59,74].Policy improvements in energy efficiency and property performance also have has a positive effect [75].Certain developments in the US have affected international real estate markets.Particularly, the reactions of REIT stocks to unexpected moves in US monetary policy, inflation, and employment conditions have widely varied.In the case of the Fed's policy shock, the impact on international REITs is driven by signaling effects; it is also an asset pricing channel through which monetary policy has transmitted the shock [45].

Asia: Singapore's housing market has been severely unbalanced, with market prices rising across the board and several rounds of market cooling measures being required.The property market is largely policy driven, and policymakers must clearly define the targets of intervention and expectations [76].The Israeli public policy has stopped housing prices from rising in the short term, but has failed to achieve the long-term goal of reducing them [44].China's real estate market is highly regulated, and development is significantly influenced by governmental policies [48].Changes in the Chinese governmental policy are an important source of volatility in the property market [32].EPU is a net transmitter of spillovers and affects most of the housing market [77].Real estate control policies affect the banks' discount rate risk of real estate enterprises [78].

Australia: Many studies conducted in Australia have shown the importance of public policy in increasing housing supply as an effective way to mitigate the rapid increase in housing prices [79].Monetary policies have had a significant impact on the real estate industry, especially the construction industry [46].The government must increase the supply of affordable housing and suspend policies that benefit both investors and homeowners [80].Australian housing prices are dominated by mortgage rates, consumer sentiment, stock market indices, and unemployment.The monetary, fiscal, and macroeconomic policies need to be balanced to optimize the stability and steady growth of Australia's housing market.Monetary policy is a blunt tool that is used to manage the nation's financial stability.A balanced and complementary combination of fiscal and monetary policy decisions is needed to improve Australia's overall fiscal health [25].

In a large number of studies, housing policy has mainly affected the supply and demand in the market to ensure effective operation.On the one hand, economies can reduce the demand for housing by implementing housing policies.The first option is through a monetary policy, which involves restrictions on mortgage lending to reduce housing demand, for example, by increasing interest rates.The second option is to use fiscal policies to reduce housing demand through tax controls, such as property taxes.Third, macroprudential regulations can be implemented to reduce systemic risk and slow down housing demand by, for example, limiting the LTV and DTI ratios.Policymakers can also increase the number of houses in the real estate market to influence the supply and guarantee a balance between supply and demand in the real estate market.Housing policies should be more market-oriented, and their evaluations policy should mainly depend on the financial and regulatory environment of the housing market [81].This can help reduce reliance on administrative measures, which require a comprehensive understanding of the real estate market.

By conducting a literature review on the global real estate market, we find that housing prices are one of the important factors affecting the stability of the real estate market.It is the link between the real estate market and macro economy, as well as the measurement standard for testing the effectiveness of the national housing policy.

We find that the nature of housing policies implemented by different countries also varies.Some countries have advocated socialist policies, supported social equality, stabilized housing prices in the free real estate market, passed laws to limit housing prices, and even provided large amounts of public housing to stabilize the real estate market.Countries that have promoted the principles of market liberalism and support-related property rights have often allowed the free market to determine the price levels in the economy with little regulatory intervention.


## Conclusion

This study adopts a systematic quantitative literature review to examine the impact of housing policies on the real estate market.We find that housing policies affecting the real estate market can be divided into the following three categories: monetary, tax, and macro-prudential policies.Changes in supply and demand in the real estate market primarily reflect the effectiveness of policies, with housing price factors acting as the transmission mechanism.Simultaneously, the influence of housing policies in different countries C. Zhao and F. Liu and regions on real estate market factors is compared to provide a reference for future studies.
