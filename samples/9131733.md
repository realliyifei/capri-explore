Development of a Pilot Data Management Infrastructure for Biomedical Researchers at University of Manchester -Approach, Findings, Challenges and Outlook of the MaDAM Project Research Computing - IT Services (RC/ITS) MaDAM Project Overview

Practice Track -Meik Poschen et al. 7 th International Digital Curation Conference

## Main Requirements

Generic need for trusted, structured central storage with auto-back up and improved capabilities for reuse, sharing, searching and overall management of data files.

The prototype provides a navigation structure based on researchers' projects and experiments, centralized and backed up data storage, access rights, linkage and annotation of research data and a search function.

Need for good practices in data management and digital curation policies to tie in with researchers' actual research practice, institutional settings and cultures.


## MaDAM and eScholar

Manchester eScholar Services have the mission to Existing institutional and faculty support for researchers -including IT Services, Research Offices and people managing the core facilities and scanners -directly and indirectly contribute to research data management.

Engagement of these support structures will be essential to policy development and are critical to sustainability in terms of both buy in and the potential for capacity building in their services.

A cultural change is/might be needed for the proper support of domain specific data management plans, research practices and research management policies in general, and this, inevitably, will take time (and won't be easy!). High level institutional support is crucial, too! 


## Delivering MiSS

MiSS will be delivering a service which will include 


International Digital Curation Conference, Bristol, 5-7 December 2011 -Practice Track -Meik Poschen et al.


"sustain and enhance the research reputations of individuals and organisations affiliated with The University of Manchester" "enhance the global research community's ability to access The University of Manchester's research outputs" For the MaDAM project eScholar will provide a resolvable end point for publishing of data to the wider research community be a searchable archive for MaDAM data allowing the University to meet it's retention commitments Integrating Research Information Management Data MaDAM is currently exploring the integration of UoM RIM data (auto-retrieval) UoM's RIM environment itself is in the process of being linked more seamlessly UoM RIM (as of March 2011): CRM (pre-award) + Oracle Financials (post-award) + other information data to be entered manually at present


Pilot Users: Findings No official backup policies to protect against loss of data Decentralized & fragmented storage (USB sticks, optical disks) Limited ability to share data internally or externally High levels of redundant data (duplicate copies) No structured annotation of data Limited search capabilities Limited means to disseminate data No archiving policies to guarantee long term curation waste of time -risk of data loss -finding, reuse & sharing difficult -clogging of valuable storage space


Making the best use of pilot users' limited time Managing the expectations of UoM and external interested users Ensuring that solutions would fall inline with working practices Dealing with a diverse & fragmented landscape (policies, funders) Engagement of institutional support structures is essential The use of Research Data Management within the actual Working Practice is evolving -emerging patterns and behaviour:How much storage will research groups/researchers need over what time -how long has data to be kept in an active or easy accessible state for reuse or sharing? How will the relationship between new policies and research practices develop? How will dissemination practices and hence Scholarly Communications develop or change?Transition: from MaDAM to MiSSMaDAM: successful in addressing the needs of its user groups and in developing a pilot infrastructure, which is live, maintained and actively utilised by its pilot user base.Madam's outputs & findings (researchers' benefits) together with being part of an initiative for a sustainable University-wide Research Data Management Service helped secure funding for the successor project MiSS (MaDAM into Sustainable Service).MiSS (MaDAM into Sutainable Service) will be building on MaDAM, although it is more a transitional project than a continuation which will move the pilot into a sustainable service within the University's new technical framework at the end of its lifetime in March 2013.Picking up from MaDAM....in MiSS on endeavours started but not 
completed/evaluated within pilot's lifetime/remit: 

• Researchers' dissemination practices... 

• …and full integration of eScholar (MaDAM: proof of 
concept) 

• Automatic population of research information data 
(accounting, grants) 

• Enabling better metadata ingestion from different 
sources in various disciplines (via community input)

Growth of DMP Checklist, and feedback received • Need for smarter solution than a paper checklist • Desire to provide more tailored guidance at point of need 2. Background to the US-UK collaboration & Impetus for DMP Tool • Announcement of NSF mandate • Conversations at IDCC in Chicago (December 2010) • Experimentation with DMP Online code -not suitable • Decision to develop a separate tool 3. Differences in requirements Export PDF, HTML, CSV, TXT, XML, RTF, DOCX PDF, TXT, RTF, URL 5a. DMP Online partnerships • Checklist and interface developed via iterative community consultation process • Recommended and supported by JISC • Generic guidance developed with the UK Data Archive • More tailored guidance being developed with the funders / UKDA. (Endorsement by funders also being sought.) • Disciplinary guidance and worked examples developed with JISC MRD projects (DMT Psych, DATUM for Health...) • More JISC MRD projects adapting the tool for institutional contexts • Partnering with DMP Tool, and involved in conversations with European Commission, Australia...1) Rebuilding and integrating the MaDAM technical service 
infrastructure, making it more generic but tailorable 
(domain/discipline specific plug-ins/plug-in points), 

2) providing a Research Data Management Policy (incl. 
DMPs), along with a supporting Service, and 

3) integrating with the necessary human infrastructure, 
addressing needs across UoM. 
MiSS User Community 

For the domain specific user community the project 
includes five research groups covering all four faculties. 

Academic Champions in 

• Life Sciences 

• Engineering and Physical Science 

• Medical and Human Sciences 

• Humanities/applied quantitative social research 

We will furthermore set up a user committee open to all 
research disciplines at UoM to balance specific with 
generic needs. 
MiSS Challenges 

Bridge between and cater for generic and specific needs, 
making the RDMI easy usable but open enough for 
specific tools and automated data ingestion by providing 
'plug-in points' 
Integration with the Manchester Technical IT Services 
infrastructure, which is evolving concurrently 
(Manchester Working Environment, MWE) 

Balance researcher, internal and external research data 
management needs and policies (research cultures & 
work practices, University structure with research offices 
& faculties and funder requirements) 

Beware scope-creep and keep all stakeholders in line 
towards delivering a RDMI Service in March 2013

1. Impetus for development 

• DMP support developed to meet funders' increasing 
requirements 
• • Mapping to a checklist vs direct answering of funder 
requirements (philosophical) 
• Institutional 'ownership' vs national service (cultural) 
• Authentication processes (technical / organisational) 
• Tabular comparison... 

4. Comparison of tools' functionalities 

Feature 
DMP Online (v3.0) 
DMP Tool (v1.0) 

Authentication 
Username and password 
Shibboleth or username/password 

Associated guidance 
Can be customised for each template Funder + Institution 

Templates 
Multiple 
Funder + Institution 

Licensing 

Free to use. Hope to make Open 
Source in time. 
Open Source (Bitbucket) 

Logic / approach 

Funder requirements mapped to a 
generic Checklist (rules-based) 
Direct answering of verbatim requirements 

Sharing 

Granular permissions to enable 
sharing / transfer of plans 
Read-only sharing via URL 

Hosting 

Virtual environment at Edinburgh. 
(JANET in future?) 

Hosted by CDL, but anyone can run their 
own instance (minus the database content) 

Liaison with funders 

Close to endorsement from multiple 
funders 
Viewed positively by funders
