The gravity of the problem The 1921 census gives 102,513 as the number of lepers in India, but mentions that this is short of the real number, as only conspicuous sufferers from this disease were likely to be enumerated by the untrained people who gathered the statistics. Recently, an estimate was made by the sanitation staff of a certain town in India that there were only six lepers in a certain ward of the town. Immediately after, a second survey made by skilled workers showed that there were at least 144 lepers (24 times the original figure) in that ward, and in all probability even more. It is not suggested that the 1921 census figure should be multiplied by 24 in order to arrive at the number of lepers, but we are safe in calculating that there are from one half to one million lepers in India.

Leprosy is not a very fatal disease. Compared with malaria, tuberculosis and cholera tTiere are comparatively few deaths. But after all the death roll is not the only criterion of the suffering caused by a malady. Leprosy probably accounts for more mental, if not physical, suffering than any other disease in the country. To many lepers the prospect of speedy death instead of long years of suffering would come as a welcome relief.

While in some parts of India leprosy is decreasing, there seems to be no doubt that in other parts improved communications by rail and road, and the opening up of highly endemic areas hitherto isolated from their surroundings, are leading to marked increase and dissemination of the disease.

Recent surveys have brought to light the important part which industrial concerns play in the spreading of leprosy infection. The workers in industrial areas are drawn from different parts of the country and from different classes. The various, human elements discard their customary class rules to a large extent when they leave home; they tend to mix promiscuously, often in insanitary or crowded surroundings; and thus we have ideal conditions for the spread of a chronic infection like leprosy. This state of affairs has been brought out by our survey figures which show an incidence of at least one per cent, in almost all industrial areas, and this number rises to three per cent., or even higher, in some places. A very heavy responsibility devolves upon those who are in charge of sanitary measures in these areas.

B. E. L. R. A. (Indian Council) and its policy The Viceroy appealed in 1924 for funds to form a branch of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association in India. A sum of over 20 lakhs ? of rupees was subscribed and the question arose as to the best method of using this money. Since the discovery of the bacillus of leprosy by Hansen in 1872, the accepted method of dealing with the disease has been through segregation in leper asylums. Judging from the expense involved in founding and running these institutions it would not have been possible to arrange for the segregation of more than one or two thousand lepers with the amount available. Moreover the majority of lepers who migrate to such institutions have in the past been those who have reached the last stage of the disease in which the infection is dying out, and who have already spread the infection to their relations and neighbours. New line of campaign.?It was decided therefore that a new line of campaign was necessary. Research had recently shown two things :? (1) that leprosy can be diagnosed with ease in almost every case at a stage when the patient has not begun to be infectious and a danger to others, and (2) that at this stage most cases treated efficiently and for a long enough time recover.

It is easily understood therefore that a scheme which aims at diagnosing and treating all early cases and organising prevention is likely to be much more effective in controlling leprosy than one which can only hope to segregate in asylums some two or three thousand out of the half to one million lepers of India. Accordingly the policy adopted by the Indian Council of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association has been :?(1) the diagnosis and treatment of all but especially early cases, and to the disease is conveyed from one P ^a(j another and also that good resulijl good-will from treatment. In this way th g and confidence of the people_ are j:'ease patients, instead of trying to hide t ' come forward in the hope of being cured. It is possible to carry out a much more thorough census by the propaganda-treatment-survey method than could be done otherwise.

3. Propaganda.?After all, the most important factor in stamping out leprosy is isolation of infectious cases, and this can only be done as the result of propaganda and gradually educating the community as to where the real danger lies. The Association has prepared and distributes literature both for doctors and for the lay public. Among the latter an illustrated booklet entitled ' What the Public should know about Leprosy' has been translated into eleven Indian vernaculars, and sets of lantern slides, along with an explanatory booklet, can be obtained. A series of five leaflets has been prepared for distribution and has been translated into several vernaculars. Leprosy in India, a journal which acts as a record of progress of anti-leprosy work in India, with notes on methods used in other countries, is published quarterly. 4. Research.?Although the last activity of the Association to be mentioned is research, it is not the least item, but the most important of all. It was as the result of research that the Association was begun, and it is on its findings that the above programme has been founded. Much has still to be found out, for leprosy is a difficult disease to understand:

Unlike the sister disease, tuberculosis, it is doubtful if its causal germ has yet been grown outside the human body; and the mode of infection and spread in the body, though worked out to a certain extent, still remain mysterious. Then much has yet to be done to improve the treatment of leprosy, and this can only be done through careful practical study by experts.

Provincial branches.?Most of the provinces and some of the states have branches of their own and a certain proportion of the funds of B. E. L. R. A. is set apart to be distributed to these branches. As examples of the work being done in various provinces by the co-operation of the provincial branches of the B. E. L. R. A. and the local governments, we may quote the following :? Bengal.?Here the leprosy work of the province is organised by the Bengal branch of the B. E. L. R. A. with the aid of grants from government, municipal authorities, local boards, etc. There is a leprosy propaganda officer for Bengal who has visited nearly all the districts, organising courses of instruction for doctors, carrying on propaganda work, and as occasion arises doing brief surveys and starting clinics.

In addition there is a survey party of one chief and three assistant doctors who have thoroughly surveyed some of the areas of Bengal in which leprosy is most common, doing propaganda work and establishing clinics, which after the survey are then carried on by local doctors under district authorities and industrial concerns. [Feb., 1933 An interesting feature of the Bengal work has been the survey of industrial areas, jute mills, mines and tea gardens.

In Bengal there are over seventy leprosy clinics started by the B. E. L. R. A. workers and being carried on by doctors appointed and supported-by local authorities.

The Bengal branch has a small income which has been sufficient to support only one good leprosy officer; but he, by ability and keenness, has been able to enlist the co-operation and financial support of government and local authorities, so that the work has developed widely. If the funds of the B. E. L. R. A. had been used to finance clinics, the result would have, been only two or three clinics and not the present large number.

Madras.?The survey party of the Indian .Council of the B. E. L. R. A. has visited this presidency on two occasions and as a result the Madras Government, in consultation with the senior, writer, have drawn up a scheme of antileprosy work in the presidency. The presidency has been divided into six areas for each of which has been appointed a special leprosy officer to carry on propaganda and survey work, create treatment centres attached to suitable medical institutions, train doctors, and generally organise and co-ordinate leprosy work. By co-operation with the public health department it is hoped to complete a more or less accurate register of all leprosy cases detected. This it is planned to check by quinquennial surveys by public health authorities.

Attempts have been made in Madras to coordinate the work of leper asylums and leprosy clinics.

There are in existence about 80 clinics financed by government and local authorities. village, follow up the infectious case, gain the confidence of the inhabitants and enquire into the history of the origin and spread of the disease in that particular village. From this information he should prepare his special propaganda, explaining not in general but in particular terms how leprosy can be prevented.

Leprosy can only be controlled by limiting the opportunity of spreading infection. We do not know the exact mode of spread of leprosy, but certain important facts are now generally accepted. Leprosy is spread by contact of infective cases with healthy people. The more intimate the contact and the greater the period of contact, the greater is the danger. Children and young people are much more susceptible to leprosy than adults. Prevention must aim at preventing this contact specially with young children. Isolation of all infective lepers-in institutions is impracticable in India, but much might be done to carry out isolation in villages and in homes. The type of contact which is most dangerous is the type which is commonly seen in joint-family houses at night, infective lepers sleeping together with healthy members of the family in a small crowded room. This should if possible be prevented. In some villages it may be possible to have huts put up outside the village where infective lepers should live and sleep. They can go about and work if possible during the day, but they must sleep in separate quarters at night. The same applies to the homes of lepers. A separate room or a hut outside the joint-family house, for the infectious case to live and sleep in, is very essential. Even now this is sometimes provided by the families of lepers, but only when the patient has become deformed, unsightly and ulcerated. This is too late. Many patients have been infective for years before they reach this state, and in fact the deformities and ulcerations are oft'en a sign that the infective stage is drawing to a close. The village or home isolation must be carried out much earlier and much more efficiently. Too often one sees infective lepers living in a separate hut, but attended by the children of the family. Thus the home isolation is rendered worse than useless, for children are much more susceptible to leprosy than adults. In home and village isolation, arrangements must be made for separate eating and drinking utensils, as well as for separate sleeping accommodation, and the importance of protecting children from infection must be realised.

The great predisposing causes of leprosy in India are the bad social and hygienic conditions of the people. Bad housing, bad diet and debilitating diseases render people susceptible to leprosy and provide the conditions under which leprosy spreads. Therefore all measures which tend to improve social and hygienic conditions and to help people to love a healthy life will also tend to bring about a diminution in leprosy. Leprosy propaganda should therefore merge into the wider sphere of general public health work. [Feb., 1933 What provincial and local authorities can do Since leprosy work falls quite naturally into the sphere of public health and preventive medicine, in most places it would be well for leprosy work to be an activity of the public health authority.

It cannot be too strongly emphasised that what will ultimately do more than anything else to control leprosy is the education of the public to recognise leprosy as a transmissible disease which can be controlled by preventing contact with infective cases. They will then insist on a reasonable degree of isolation of such cases in families, villages, and communities. This public opinion can only be formed as the result of teaching and propaganda, wisely organised and specially planned to reach the particular people whom it is desired to influence. The methods of work which have been found most effective have already been described in this paper.

These methods must be modified to meet local conditions. The propaganda work will gain much in effectiveness if based on a study of local conditions affecting leprosy, and also if associated with treatment centres which greatly aid in securing the confidence and co-operation of the people.

The following is an outlined policy for antileprosy work.' It will be found useful by provincial and state authorities and also by those in charge of district and municipal health work.

1. Organise a leprosy board consisting of official and private individuals in order to stimulate interest and public support for leprosy work.


The funds of the Madras branch of the B. E. L. R. A. are handed over to the government to help to pay for the leprosy staff.Madras being more developed than many other parts of India the government are able to consider the organisation of a definite scheme of widespread leprosy work. The progress of this work will be watched with interest.Bihar and Orissa.?This branch distributes part of its income in grants to clinics and and an increase in the number of clinics and patients is recorded and the results are reported as being very encouraging. Reports of work done in other provinces are published in the annual report of the B. E. L. R. A. (Indian Council).< 

hospitals treating leprosy. The government had 
a leprosy officer and a survey party, and it was 

reported in 1931 that there were 36 clinics. In 

addition there was a whole-time leprosy officer 
in the Puri district, and an annual grant from 
the Bettiah Raj estate paid for two whole-time 

leprosy officers in the Champaran district. 

The government have 

as 
a 

measure 

of 

economy abolished the post of leprosy expert 
and the survey party, so that in spite of a 
considerable amount of money being available 

from the B. E. L. R. A. and other sources, the 

development of anti-leprosy work in Bihar and 

Orissa is likely to be handicapped. 

Central Provinces.?After a visit of the B. E. 

L. R. A. (Indian Council) survey party in 1928, 

a leprosy specialist was appointed and a survey 
party of four doctors was formed. Systematic 

survey work was carried On and 32 centres were 

established. Sixteen of these were placed under 
the charge of special assistant medical officers 
working under the public health department, 
the remainder being run by local dispensary 
doctors. The special assistant medical officers 
run leprosy treatment centres and subcentres; 
they carry on steady propaganda and survey 
work in villages and combine with their leprosy 
work a considerable amount of general public 
health and epidemic work. This work has 
steadily progressed. The clinics run by the 

local assistant medical officers in connection with 

the existing dispensaries and hospitals have not 
been nearly so successful, and experience has 
shown that leprosy work is best done in the 
Central Provinces under the public health 
department by special officers who make leprosy 
work one of the main activities in a campaign 
for rural public health. 

The work in the Central Provinces is an in-

teresting experiment in the use of methods of 
organisation rather different from those used 
elsewhere. Every year survey work is done 

The results of this work 
(1) Survey work.?The survey has brought 
out many useful and interesting facts among 

the chief of which are these :? 

(?) Leprosy is most prevalent among semi-
aboriginal tribes who have left their 
aboriginal seclusion but have not yet 
adopted the modern sanitary measures 
common among more civilised people. 
(?) Leprosy frequently enters better class 
families through these semi-aboriginals 
when they are employed by such 

families as servants. 

(c) A single highly-infectious case may often 
infect not only a village, but indirectly 
a group of villages. 
(d) The commonest form of leprosy found 

is the 

' neural' form showing anaesthe-

tic 
macules 

or 

acroteric 
lesions. 

These cases are presumably non-infec-
tious since no bacilli can usually be 

found in them. Some of these cases 

undoubtedly progress later to the 
cutaneous form which is infectious, but 

some of them do not. Some cases, 

exactly what proportion it is difficult 
to say, undergo spontaneous arrest. 

At any one time two or three ' neural' 

cases are found to each 

' cutaneous'

case. 

(e) The finding of large numbers .of slight 
cases in a village indicates one or two

Make anti-leprosy work one of the duties of the public health service and medical service.3. Appoint a special leprosy officer who has had special training and experience in leprosy work, or else choose a good man to be trained.He should work under the public health authority and his duties will be :? (a) To train doctors and public health workers in anti-leprosy work. (b) Where there is a medical school, to instruct the students in anti-leprosy work.(c) To organise propaganda, survey and treatment work in endemic areas.(ci) In highly endemic areas in addition, to establish special treatment centres. (e) To supervise and co-ordinate all antileprosy work being done in the province or area.4.Where the appointment of a special leprosy officer is impossible, to make antileprosy work part of the duty of a responsible public-health officer.5. Make use of the available literature, vernacular pamphlets, lantern slides, posters, etc., in anti-leprosy propaganda.6. Arrange for a doctor with special training to carry out medical examination for signs (Continued at foot of next column) (Continued from previous column) of leprosy among Government employes, employes of industrial concerns, and above all of school children.7. Arrange for leprosy treatment to be given in all public hospitals and dispensaries.These measures if carried out efficiently would in time do much to help to bring leprosy under control. The expense of such measures is not great. As far as possible use should be made of existing medical and public health organisations and institutions.
