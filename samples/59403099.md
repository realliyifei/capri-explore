THE NuSTAR EXTRAGALACTIC SURVEYS: X-RAY SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THE BRIGHT HARD-BAND SELECTED SAMPLE
12 Jan 2018 September 25, 2018Draft version Preprint typeset using L A T E X style AASTeX6 v. 1.0X-rays: galaxies -galaxies: active -surveys
We discuss the spectral analysis of a sample of 63 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) detected above a limiting flux of S(8 − 24keV) = 7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 in the multi-tiered NuSTAR Extragalactic Survey program. The sources span a redshift range z = 0 − 2.1 (median z =0.58). The spectral analysis is performed over the broad 0.5-24 keV energy range, combining NuSTAR with Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data and employing empirical and physically motivated models. This constitutes the largest sample of AGN selected at > 10 keV to be homogeneously spectrally analyzed at these flux levels. We study the distribution of spectral parameters such as photon index, column density (N H ), reflection parameter (R) and 10-40 keV luminosity (L X ). Heavily obscured (log[N H /cm −2 ] ≥ 23) and Compton Thick (CT; log[N H /cm −2 ] ≥ 24) AGN constitute ∼25% (15-17 sources) and ∼2-3% ( 1-2 sources) of the sample, respectively. The observed N H distribution fairly agrees with predictions of Cosmic X-ray Background population synthesis models (CXBPSM). We estimate the intrinsic fraction of AGN as a function of N H , accounting for the bias against obscured AGN in a flux-selected sample. The fraction of CT AGN relative to log[N H /cm −2 ] = 20 − 24 AGN is poorly constrainted, formally in the range 2-56% (90% upper limit of 66%). We derived a fraction (f abs ) of obscured Zappacosta et al.AGN (log[NH /cm −2 ] = 22 − 24) as a function of L X in agreement with CXBPSM and previous z < 1 X-ray determinations. Furthermore f abs at z = 0.1 − 0.5 and log(L X /erg s −1 ) ≈ 43.6 − 44.3 agrees with observational measurements/trends obtained over larger redshift intervals. We report a significant anti-correlation of R with L X (confirmed by our companion paper on stacked spectra) with considerable scatter around the median R values.

## INTRODUCTION

Over the last decade the advent of Chandra and XMM-Newton allowed extragalactic blank-field Xray surveys to reach sufficient sensitivities (down to 10 −17 erg s −1 cm −2 ) and sky coverage (from tenths to several square degrees) to allow the study of distant populations of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN, Hickox & Markevitch 2006;Lehmer et al. 2012;Xue et al. 2012;Brandt & Alexander 2015;Luo et al. 2017). They resolved most (up to 80-90%) of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) at energies below 10 keV (e.g. Hickox & Markevitch 2006;Cappelluti et al. 2017) as a mixture of obscured and unobscured AGN, in agreement with early population-synthesis model predictions (Setti & Woltjer 1989;Comastri et al. 1995). The fraction of resolved CXB gradually decreases with energy being of the order of ∼ 50% above ∼10 keV and only few percents at > 10 keV with Swift/BAT & INTE-GRAL studies Ajello et al. 2008).

The missing unresolved AGN population which is needed to account for the remaining high energy CXB flux may be made up of a numerically non-negligible population of heavily obscured (log[N H /cm −2 ] > ∼ 23) non-local AGNs (Worsley et al. 2005;Xue et al. 2012). It is therefore crucial to directly investigate the distribution of the obscured AGN population at the high column densities contributing to the CXB at high energies. A population of AGN with column densities in excess of 10 24 cm −2 , called Compton Thick (CT) AGNs, and numerically comparable to the absorbed Compton Thin AGN, has long been posited to be responsible for the unaccounted 10-25% of the CXB flux required by population synthesis models in order to reproduce its peak at 20-30 keV (Comastri et al. 1995;Gilli et al. 2007, hereafter G07). Recent works though suggest that also less obscured sources may contribute significantly to the missing flux at > 10 keV once other relevant high-energy spectral complexities of the AGN spectrum are taken into proper consideration (Treister et al. 2009;Akylas et al. 2012;Ueda et al. 2014). The latter would therefore lessen the need for a contributing sizable population of CT sources.

Given their very large column densities, the most obscured sources can effectively be detected in the X-rays at rest-frame energies > 5 − 10 keV since their primary continuum is strongly suppressed at softer energies. This can be currently done (i) locally (z < 0.1) by targeting bright sources (e.g., > ∼ 5 × 10 −12 erg s −1 cm −2 ; Baumgartner et al. 2013) Seyfert-type (L X ≈ 5 × 10 43 erg s −1 ) with hard X-ray (> 10 keV) surveys such as those performed by Swift/BAT & INTEGRAL Ajello et al. 2008) and (ii) at high redshifts (z > 1) with the most sensitive Chandra/XMM-Newton observations of the deep/medium survey fields (e.g. Civano et al. 2016;Luo et al. 2017). Through either spectral or hardness ratio analysis they allowed to quantify and characterize the obscured Compton Thin (log[N H /cm −2 ] = 22 − 24) AGN population and further shed light on the known decreasing trend between the numerical relevance of this population compared to all AGN (absorbed fraction) and the source luminosity (Lawrence & Elvis 1982;Gilli et al. 2007;Burlon et al. 2011;Buchner et al. 2015) and its redshift evolution (La Franca et al. 2005;Treister & Urry 2006;Ballantyne et al. 2006;Aird et al. 2015a;Buchner et al. 2015;Liu et al. 2017). They also allowed to explore the importance of the CT population although with different constraining power and different non-negligible degrees of bias especially at the highest column densities and lowest luminosities (e.g. Burlon et al. 2011;Brightman et al. 2014;Lanzuisi et al. 2015;Buchner et al. 2015;Ricci et al. 2015).

Indeed the large diversity in the spectral shapes as well as poorly explored observational parameters in low counting regimes 1 such as the high energy cut-off and the reflection strength at high energies (Treister et al. 2009;Ballantyne et al. 2011, hereafter BA11), the scattered fractions at low energies (Brightman & Ueda 2012;Lanzuisi et al. 2015) or physical parameters such as the Eddington ratio (Draper & Ballantyne 2010), may further introduce uncertainty or biases, enlarging the possible range of the fraction of CT sources to one order of magnitude (Akylas et al. 2012) or even significantly reduce their importance (Gandhi et al. 2007). Indeed, given the paucity of CT sources effectively contributing to the CXB missing flux, the most recent populationsynthesis models try to explain the CXB missing com-ponent as mainly a pronounced reflection contribution from less obscured sources with a reduced contribution by CT AGN (Treister et al. 2009;Ballantyne et al. 2011;Akylas et al. 2012). Going deeper at high energies while retaining the capability of being greatly less affected by obscuration bias, will enable us to efficiently sample a more distant (z = 0.1 − 1) and luminous population (i.e. at the knee of the luminosity function, L X ≈ 10 44 erg s −1 ) of obscured sources and better characterize their high energy spectrum, substantially improving constraints on the majority of the obscured AGN contributing to the CXB (e.g., Gilli 2013). The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR; Harrison et al. 2013) is perfectly tailored for this task. Indeed, as the first hard X-ray focusing telescope in orbit, it provides a two order of magnitude increase in sensitivity compared to any previous hard X-ray detector. With its higher sensitivity, NuSTAR has resolved ∼ 35% of the CXB near its peak (Harrison et al. 2016, hereafter H16) and is able to probe the hard X-ray (> 10 keV) sky beyond the local Universe (z > 0.1).

The NuSTAR wedding-cake extragalactic survey strategy focuses on several well-known medium-deep fields with extensive multi-wavelength coverage. The core of it includes the EGS (Del Moro et al. in prep.), E-CDFS (Mullaney et al. 2015), COSMOS (Civano et al. 2015) fields, and a wider and typically shallower Serendipitous survey (Lansbury et al. 2017b, L17). A further extension of it with the observation of two deep fields (CDF-N, Del Moro et al. in prep; UDS, Masini et al. submitted) has also recently been completed. This multi-tiered program has already detected 676 AGN out to z ≈ 3.4 (Alexander et al. 2013;Civano et al. 2015;Mullaney et al. 2015;Aird et al. 2015b;Lansbury et al. 2017b), of which 228 are significantly detected in the hard 8-24 keV NuSTAR band. In particular, at low redshift, Civano et al. (2015) presented the spectroscopic identification of a local (z ∼ 0.04) low-luminosity (∼ 5 × 10 42 erg s −1 ) CT AGN not previously recognized by either Chandra or XMM-Newton with a column density N H ≥ 10 24 cm −2 . Lansbury et al. (2017a) identified three similar sources at z < 0.1 with even higher obscuration in the NuSTAR Serendipitous Survey. At highredshift, Del Moro et al. (2014) presented the detection of a heavily absorbed (N H = 6 × 10 23 cm −2 ) quasar at z = 2.

The redshift range and the luminosities probed by the NuSTAR extragalactic survey program are well matched to CXB population-synthesis models in terms of characterization of the AGN high energy spectral shape and of the dominant obscured populations contributing to the CXB. In the latter case population synthesis models predict the largest CT AGN contributions from sources at z =0.4-1.2 with luminosities L 2−10 < ∼ 10 44 erg s −1 (e.g., Gilli 2013) and that their contribution to the residual CXB flux may amount to 90% by z ∼ 2. (Treister et al. 2009). We therefore expect NuSTAR to start to evaluate the relative importance of the obscured AGN populations and shed light on the main aspects contributing to the still unaccounted remaining flux on the peak of the CXB (i.e. heavy absorption versus reflection).

In order to elucidate on these aspects in this paper we carry out a systematic broad-band (0.5-24 keV) spectral analysis of 63 sources detected in the core NuSTAR Extragalactic Survey program and selected to have fluxes in the 8-24 keV energy band brighter than S 8−24 = 7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 . We complement the NuSTAR data with archival low-energy data from Chandra and XMM-Newton. We perform broadband (0.5-24 keV) spectral modeling, characterize their spectral properties, obtain a column density distribution, absorbed/CT fractions and source counts and compare with predictions from population-synthesis models and past observational works. A companion paper, Del Moro et al. (2017, DM17), reports on the properties of the average X-ray spectra from all sources detected in the NuSTAR deep and medium survey fields. This paper is organized as follow. Section 2 presents the sample, with Sections 3 and 4 devoted to the data reduction and spectral characterization of the source properties, respectively. We then discuss the column density distribution (Section 5), fraction of CT AGN (Section 6), fraction of absorbed sources as a function of luminosity and redshift (Section 7) and source counts (Section 8). We discuss the results in Section 9 and present the conclusions in Section 10. Relevant notes on individual sources are presented in the Appendix.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE SAMPLE

We draw our sample from the high-energy NuS-TAR catalogs compiled for the COSMOS (Civano et al. 2015, C15), ECDF-S (Mullaney et al. 2015, M15), EGS (Del Moro et al. in prep., DMIP) and Serendipitous Survey fields (L17). In order to have consistent catalogs, the same data-reduction tasks, mosaicing procedures, source detection steps, photometry and deblending algorithm were applied to all survey fields (see C15, M15 and Aird et al. 2015b for details). In the following we briefly outline the source identification procedure adopted in each catalog. The identification of the sources was consistently done through a SExtractor-based procedure on false probability maps generated on the mosaicked images accounting for the corresponding background maps in three energy bands (3-8, 8-24, 3-24 keV). No positional priors from previous low energy X-ray surveys have been used in the source identification. Through simulated data, a proper threshold to set the significance of each source identification in each band has been adopted and the final balance between completeness and reliability in each catalog has been chosen so that the possible spurious sources down to the limiting flux in each catalog do not exceed the number of 2-3. Further details and description of the procedures regarding deblending, photometry, final catalog building and association to low-energy counterparts are reported in each catalog paper. For our purposes in order to minimize obscuration bias, we selected objects with relatively bright fluxes in the hard 8-24 keV band. The fluxes adopted for this selection have been estimated from the 8-24 keV counts collected in 30 ′′ apertures 2 by the catalog papers by assuming a power-law model with Γ =1.8. Whenever possible, we complemented NuSTAR data with archival lower energy data from Chandra and XMM-Newton.


### Deep-medium survey fields

Given the 12 ′ × 12 ′ NuSTAR field of view, the survey fields (COSMOS, ECDF-S and EGS) were observed with a mosaicing strategy whereby each neighboring pointing was shifted by half of a field of view. This tile arrangement produces homogenous and continuous coverage in the deep central region with contiguous shallower edges. The main properties of these surveys are reported in Table 1.

Despite NuSTAR being sensitive up to 79 keV, typical faint sources in the deep surveys are not detected to such high energies. In the extragalactic survey work to date, we have therefore only considered three energy bands: 3-24 keV (total), 3-8 keV (soft) and 8-24 keV (hard). Fig. 1 reports the 8-24 keV sensitivity curves as a function of hard-band flux for all the fields. The sensitivities at 50% survey coverage are reported in Table 1. Notice that they are based on the assumption of an unabsorbed Γ = 1.8 power-law spectrum. This is an approximation which is reasonable for Compton-thin sources given that above 8 keV their spectrum is minimally altered at the highest column densities (i.e. log[N H /cm −2 ] > ∼ 23). It may result somewhat inadequate for CT sources whose spectrum substantially deviates from this assumed spec-Figure 1.

tral shape within this hard band. It may therefore give biased results in calculating the intrinsic distribution of physical quantities for the sampled AGN population. We account for this by correcting a-posteriori for this bias (see Sect. 6 and Fig. 11).


### Serendipitous survey fields

The serendipitous fields considered in this work consist of all fields analyzed as part of the Serendipitous Survey through 2015 January 1. This extends the sample presented by Alexander et al. (2013), and is a subset of the program presented in L17. The selection criteria adopted are reported in the following and constitute a slight modification to those employed in Aird et al. (2015b):

• we minimize Galactic point-source contamination by requiring Galactic latitudes > 20 • ;

• to emphasize fields where our serendipitous survey follow-up is currently more complete, we only consider fields accessible from the northern hemisphere by requiring declinations > −5 • ;

• we exclude fields with a large contamination from the primary targets by requiring < 10 6 counts within 120 ′′ of the aimpoint, and that primary targets contribute < ∼ 6% to the extracted emission of the serendip source within the extraction region.

After these cuts, the sky coverage of the serendipitous survey considered here amounts to ≈ 4 deg 2 (see Fig. 1). Further survey details are reported in Table 1. It is worth noting that despite the Serendipitous Survey having sensitivity better than COSMOS over a wider area and comparable faint source sensitivity to ECDF-S, it also has the disadvantage of having less multiwavelength coverage. This usually translates to lower redshift completeness (from optical spectroscopy) and a poorer quality X-ray coverage at low energies from Chandra and/or XMM-Newton (see L17).


### Selected sample

The final catalogs consist of 91, 49, 39 and 118 objects, respectively, from the NuSTAR COSMOS, ECDF-S, EGS and the Serendipitous Survey. Of these, 32, 19, 14 and 38, respectively, are significantly detected in the hard-band based on a maximum likelihood estimator (see C15, M15, A15 and L17 for details and the adopted thresholds). These objects are shown in Fig. 2 (left panel) which displays the net 3-24 keV counts within a 30 ′′ aperture versus their aperture-corrected photometry in the 8-24 keV energy band. From this combined sample we select sources with hard-band flux S 8−24keV ≥ 7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 . We are sensitive to fluxes larger than this value in 80% of the surveyed area (see Fig. 1). This sub-sample, corresponding to objects above the dashed line in Fig. 2, includes a total of 31, 3, 5 and 24 objects from the four surveys, respectively selected over a total area of ∼ 6 deg 2 . The resulting sample of 63 sources is the focus of the following analysis. The redshift distribution is reported in the right panel of Fig. 2, compared to the distribution of the 199 local sources detected by Swift-BAT in the energy range 15-55 keV (Burlon et al. 2011). NuSTAR, with its two orders of magnitude greater sensitivity, probes sources well beyond the local Universe. Table 2 reports the position, spectroscopic redshift, Chandra and XMM-Newton counterparts, NuSTAR observation IDs, and NuSTAR survey for all 63 sources. When referring to the single sources we use the catalog IDs listed in column 2 prefixed by ecdfs, egs, cosmos and ser for sources from respectively the NuSTAR-ECDF-S, EGS, COSMOS and Serendipitous catalogs.

Objects from the deep fields all have unique counterparts at lower energies from either the Chandra (Lehmer et al. 2005;Goulding et al. 2012;Xue et al. 2011;Civano et al. 2012Civano et al. , 2016 or XMM-Newton (Brusa et al. 2010;Ranalli et al. 2013) surveys of these same fields, with the exception of one source in the ECDF-S field (ecdfs5; this source has two possible counterparts, one at low and one at high-redshift; see Table 2 and Appendix).

A few sources have nearby potential contaminants (i.e. inside the NuSTAR extraction radius) in the deep survey fields. Contamination ultimately is unimportant or partially negligible in most cases, as discussed for the affected sources in the Appendix. For some cases (cos-mos154 and cosmos181) we restrict the NuSTAR low energy bound to 4-5 keV, where the contamination becomes less important. In a few other cases the contamination is such that within the uncertainties it could potentially lower the true hard-band source flux also below the threshold flux used in our sample selection (cos-mos107, cosmos178 and cosmos229). For the Serendipitous Survey sources, most have counterparts from at least Chandra or XMM-Newton, the exception being five sources (ser97, ser285, ser235, ser261, ser409; see Table 4) which have not yet been observed by these satellites.

3. DATA REDUCTION


### NuSTAR

In order to perform a proper spectral analysis for these low-count point-like sources (i.e. from tens to hundreds of counts; see Fig. 2), we need to carefully account for: 1. the relatively uniform arcmin-scale NuSTAR point spread function (FWHM=18 ′′ ; half power diameter HPD=58 ′′ ; Harrison et al. 2013); and 2. the spectrally variable and spatially dependent background (for details, see Wik et al. 2014). In particular, the latter at < 20 keV is strongly affected by stray light from unfocussed CXB photons reaching the detectors through the open design of the observatory (called "aperture background").     a Identification name for each source. This is made from a prefix indicating the source parent catalog plus the ID from NuSTAR parent catalogs (Section 2).

The prefixes of each parent catalog are cosmos for COSMOS, ecdfs for ECDF-S egs for EGS and ser for the Serentipitous Survey.   e To obtain the full NuSTAR observation IDs for the COSMOS, ECDF-S and EGS fields, the six digit survey identification numbers 60021, 60022 and 60023 must be prefixed, respectively.

Given the flux levels of the sources in our sample, it is necessary to maximize and carefully account for their contribution relative to the backgrounds (especially with respect to the spatially dependent "aperture background"). We therefore optimize the spectral extraction radius to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and, within the Poissonian uncertainties, the number of collected net counts. To do this we started with the level 2 data products and simulated background maps where the latter were created using the software nuskybgd (Wik et al. 2014) as described in C15 and M15. The simulated background maps reproduce the "aperture background" across the FoV and the normalization of the total background in each observation. In detail we determined from all the observations pertaining to a given source, the total counts in increasing circular apertures centered on the source position, calculating both source+background counts (S) from the event files and background counts alone (B) from the simulated maps. Then we calculated the radial profile for the net source counts N (< r) = S(< r) − B(< r) and
SN R(< r) = N (<r) √ N (<r)+2B(<r)
. The radius for spectral extraction r ex is chosen as the radius which maximizes the SNR profile and, within its ±1σ range, maximizes also N . In the few (nine for COSMOS and one for ECDFS) cases in which a source is blended with a nearby source (closer than 2 arcmin), we further reduced r ex so that the source flux from the contaminating source is reduced, within the aperture, to levels of 5 − 6%. Table 4 reports r ex values for all the sources in our sample.

We used the task "nuproducts" in NUSTARDAS v.1.4.1 with the NuSTAR calibration database (CALDB version 20150123) for the spectral extractions and the creation of relative response files.

The background spectrum for each source spectrum was simulated from the best-fit models of the background across the detectors obtained with nuskybgd. This software performs iterative joint fits of the observed backgrounds across the field extracted in > ∼ 3 arcmin apertures placed in each chip of each focal plane module. The joint modeling aims to determine the normalization of the different background components and hence characterize them at the position of the source. The fits are performed using spectral models of the instrumental (continuum + line activation due to particle background), cosmic focused (CXB) and cosmic unfocussed background (straylight) components and information on their spatial dependence across the detectors. We checked each best-fit to ensure that no significant spatial or spectral residuals were present. After this procedure we are in principle able to well reproduce the background spectrum at each position of the detector. We further verify this by creating backgroundsubtracted images and visually inspect them for spatial gradients indicative of poor background modeling. As a final step, the best fit spectral model is used by nuskybgd to simulate the background within the source extraction aperture but using a 100 times higher exposure time to ensure high SNR.

We then co-added for each source and in each detector spectra, simulated backgrounds and response files. Table 4 reports NuSTAR net counts and total exposure time collected for each source.


### XMM-Newton and Chandra

For the ECDF-S and COSMOS fields we employed all spectra reduced and extracted by previous works. Specifically, for the deep ECDF-S field we used Chandra data reduced by Lehmer et al. (2005) and Xue et al. (2016), and extracted spectra following procedures discused in Del Moro et al. (2014). For ecdfs20, which only has an XMM-Newton spectrum, the data reduction and spectral extraction are from Ranalli et al. (2013) and Georgantopoulos et al. (2013). For the COS-MOS field we use spectra reduced and extracted for XMM-Newton by Mainieri et al. (2007) and for Chandra by Lanzuisi et al. (2013), with the only exception being source cosmos330 for which a spectrum from the COSMOS-Legacy field has been used .

For the Serendipitous Survey fields we reduced and extracted the Chandra and XMM-Newton data. In the selection of archival observations, we only use data from observations in which CCD detectors are primary instruments (i.e., we exclude Chandra grating observations). In the case of XMM-Newton we almost always only use data from PN, the exception being ser107 which was located in a CCD gap of the PN camera. For this source we use the MOS data. For the Chandra data we used both ACIS-S and ACIS-I detectors whenever available (see Table 3 for details). When multiple archival datasets were available we chose the data closest in time to the NuSTAR observation, if available, in order to minimize source variability. Table 3 reports the selected observations for each source. (2) XMM-Newton/MOS data; (3) Observations chosen to be closest in time to the NuSTAR data; (4) the source is on the Chandra /ACIS-S2 chip; (5) the source is on the Chandra /ACIS-S3 chip; (6) see Ricci et al. (2016) for details on data reduction and spectral extraction;

We reduced the Chandra data using CIAO v. 4.7 3 with CALDB v. 4.6.7. We re-processed the data using the chandra repro script to produce new recalibrated level=2 event files. The spectral extraction was done with the script specextract, which automates the creation of source and background spectral files and the relative ARF and RMF. The source and background spectral extractions were performed on user-selected circular and annular concentric regions, respectively, in order to maximize the source flux and avoid point source contamination to background measurements. We finally combined the resulting spectra using the FTOOLs script addascaspec, available in HEASOFT v. 6.16 4 , and produced combined RMFs and ARFs using the tasks addrmf and addarf. The resulting exposure times and collected net-source counts are reported in Table 4.

For the XMM-Newton data we used SAS v14.0.0 5 . For each observation we screened the event files for time intervals impacted by soft proton flares by adopting an observation dependent 10-12 keV count-rate threshold (0.4 ± 0.1 counts s −1 being the average and 1σ standard deviation of the applied threshold), above which data were removed. For the spectral extraction and creation of response files we followed the standard procedures outlined in the XMM-Newton science threads 6 . We extracted events with pattern ≤ 4 for the PN camera and ≤ 12 for the MOS detectors. We combined the MOS1 and MOS2 spectra using the SAS task epicspeccombine. For sources with more than one data set, we produced combined source spectra, background spectra, ARF and RMF as per the Chandra data. Exposure times and net-source counts for each source are reported in Table 4.

For the EGS field, Chandra data products from Goulding et al. (2012) have been used. The spectral extraction, specifically carried out for this work 7 , has been performed using specextract for each individual observation. Background regions were taken from annuli with 1.3 * r 90,psf -3.0 * r 90,psf (with the latter being the radius enclosing 90% of the point spread function) with other detected sources masked out. Spectra and backgrounds were combined for the different observations using combine spectra in CIAO.


## DATA ANALYSIS

We performed the spectral analysis using XSPEC v. 12.8.2 using the Cash statistic (Cash 1979) with the direct background subtraction option (Wachter et al. 1979). In the limit of a large number of counts per bin, the distribution of this statistic, called the W statistic (W stat), approximates the χ 2 distribution with N − M degrees of freedom (dof , where N is the number of independent bins and M is the number of free parameters).

We performed all our modeling with spectra binned to 5 net-counts (i.e., background subtracted) per bin with the exception of sources with low number of counts (i.e. < ∼ 50 counts from both NuSTAR detectors) for which we resorted to a finer binning of 1 net-count per bin.

The spectral modeling has been performed: (a) for the NuSTAR-only data in the energy range 3 − 24 keV assuming a power-law, with absorption and reflection (Sect. 4.1), and (b) jointly together with XMM-Newton and Chandra over the broader 0.5−24 keV energy band using more complex models (Sect. 4.2).

Notice that despite the spectral analysis being performed up to 24 keV, on average, our spectra are sensitive to slightly lower energies. The median and semiinterquartile range for the highest energy bin in the FPMA and FPMB spectra are 19.6 ± 3.0 keV and 17.9 ± 2.4 keV, respectively.


### NuSTAR spectral analysis

For the NuSTAR-only analysis (3 − 24 keV) we first used a power-law model. We freeze the cross-calibration between FPMA and FPMB since, given the few percent level of accuracy measured by Madsen et al. (2015) and the limited counts of the majority of our spectra (up to a few hundreds) we do not expect to distinguish these small calibration levels (i.e., the statistical uncertainties exceed the systematic ones). The left panel of Fig. 3 presents the power-law photon index Γ values plotted against the net counts in the 3 − 24 keV band. The Γ values are, on average, flatter than the canonical 1.8-2 values (e.g. Piconcelli et al. 2005;Dadina 2008) with a mean (median) of 1.5 (1.6). The distribution of Γ is reported by the black histogram in the right-upper panel. Spectra with fewer counts than the median have slightly flatter photon indices than high-count sources, Γ low = 1.4 ± 0.2 compared to Γ high = 1.7 ± 0.3. The average hardening of faint sources agrees with the shape of the CXB in approximately the same energy range (Marshall et al. 1980) as already found at lower energies (e.g., Mushotzky et al. 2000;Giacconi et al. 2001;Brandt et al. 2001). There is one notable outlier with a negative Γ value, the CT thick source in the COSMOS field reported by C15 (cosmos330 in Table 2). The average flat values of Γ point to a more complex spectral shape in the NuSTAR energy band.  Table 4 continued  b Extraction radius in arcsec.

c Counts in the energy range 4.5-24 keV. See Appendix for details on this source.

d MOS spectrum; the source falls in a chip gap in PN.

In order to identify a more suitable model which would bring the power-law photon indices to the canonical 1.8-2 values, we explored two modifications to the simple power-law model. We first allowed for lowenergy photoelectric absorption by the circumnuclear interstellar matter using the zwabs model in XSPEC. Given the 3 keV lower bound of the NuSTAR energy range, this model modification did not change appreciably the distribution of Γ, producing a median of 1.6 and only a few outliers (∼ 10% of the sample) at values much larger than 3 (see red dashed histogram in Fig. 3). An alternative modification is the inclusion, beside the simple power-law component, of an additional cold Compton-reflection component to account for the disk/torus reflectors. This component is particularly important in the NuSTAR hard-energy band. We used the pexrav model (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995) which assumes that the reflector is an infinite slab with infinite optical depth illuminated by the primary powerlaw continuum, subtending an angle Ω = 2πR, where R is the reflection parameter. For a source of isotropic emission Ω = 2π, hence R = 1. We tied both the photon index and the normalization of the reflection model to those of the primary power-law and let R vary. In our modeling throughout the paper we set this parameter in XSPEC to be negative, as for pexrav this will switch on the reflection-only solution as opposed to the reflection+power-law solution activated by positive values. Throughout the text we quote the absolute value of the parameter. We left the abundance at its default solar value, cos θ = 0.45 (i.e., inclination angle θ ∼ 63 deg, the default value in the model), and set the exponential cutoff (E c ) for the incident power-law primary continuum at 200 keV (as assumed by G07 and consistent with recent determinations by NuSTAR; see Fabian et al. 2015 for a compilation). This additional component shifts the mean and median photon index to higher values (Γ = 1.8 and Γ = 1.7, respectively), but at the cost of increasing the dispersion of the distribution (see blue histogram in Fig. 3). There is no trend in the median Γ with the number of counts except for the dispersion with low-count sources having an interquartile range of 1.2 as opposed to high counts sources which have an interquartile range of 0.6. Histograms of the Γ distribution for the three models are reported in the right panels of Fig. 3.


### Joint broad band analysis

In order to improve the modeling and obtain tighter constraints on the spectral parameters, we added lower energy data from XMM-Newton and Chandra , thereby extending the spectral range down to E= 0.5 keV (observed frame). Table 4 reports details on the low energy data used for each source.

We first consider an empirical model (hereafter called constant×wabs(powerlaw sc +zwabs×powerlaw + zgauss + pexrav)

where powerlaw represents the primary coronal component modified at low energies with photoelectric absorption (model zwabs) and complemented at high energies with the addition of a cold Compton-reflection component (model pexrav). We further add at lowenergy a power-law (powerlaw sc ) to account, when needed, for residual low energy flux for absorbed sources (hereafter called scattered component) consisting either of primary component flux scattered outside the nuclear absorbing region or of circumnuclear photoionized gas. At high energy we add a line (zgauss) to account for neutral Fe Kα emission at 6.4 keV produced by the surrounding reflecting cold medium and let its normalization free to vary. The entire model is modified by photoelectric absorption (wabs) from Galactic interstellar gas using values reported by Kalberla et al. (2005) at the position of each source. The constant accounts for instrument intercalibration and possible source flux variability, as well allowing for a crude accounting of possible contamination from blended sources inside differing extraction radii. We left the constant free to vary between satellites, but always tied between the two NuSTAR FPMs 8 as done in Section 4.1. We left the slope and the normalization of the scattered component free to vary. As in Sect. 4.1 we used the reflectiononly component from PEXRAV and tied both Γ and normalization to the corresponding parameters of the primary component. Other PEXRAV parameters are set to the default values as reported in Sect. 4.1. In this way our fits with the baseline model are performed with 5 free parameters. In case of joint fit performed with one or two additional low-energy datasets, one or two intercalibration constants need to be accounted as additional free parameters, respectively. Furthermore in case of sources with soft-excess component two additional free parameters need to be considered for the slope and normalization of the scattered component. In order to speed up our modeling which, using pexrav, can be quite time consuming, the error estimation on all parameters was obtained with the reflection strength parameter R and calibration constants fixed to their best-fit values. For error estimation in R, we left free to vary only N H , Γ and normalization of the primary power-law component. Best-fit spectral parameters are reported in Table 5 along with fluxes in the 8-24 keV and 3-24 keV bands, and 10-40 keV unabsorbed and intrinsic coronal luminosities inferred from the best-fit baseline model (see Section 4.4 for details). Fig. 4 shows broadband spectra for four sources along with their best-fit model. For the few sources exhibiting extreme Γ values below 1.3 or above ∼ 2.5 or reflection parameter larger than ∼ 10, we redid the fits with Γ fixed to 1.8. These sources are cosmos129, cosmos232, cosmos253, cosmos282, ser285, ser77 and ser261. In three cases, mainly unabsorbed sources with high-quality spectra, the baseline parametrization in the soft (ser148) and broad-band (ser37, egs26) was inadequate. Indeed, in these energy ranges absorbed power-law models return slopes in the range Γ = 0.2 − 1.2 with very little absorption. We therefore further modified the absorbed primary power-law by further applying absorption from a partial covering cold (zpcfabs in XSPEC) or partially ionized (zxipcf) medium. Details on these sources are reported in the Appendix. . Examples of broad-band spectra for four sources with best-fit baseline models (solid lines). Black, red, green and blue spectra refer to Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR-FPMA and NuSTAR-FPMB, respectively. Upper/lower spectra are for unabsorbed/absorbed sources. Spectra on the left/right are for sources with redshifts lower/higher than z .


### Absorption and photon index from the primary power-law

The distribution of the measured Γ peaks at around 1.8-2, with a mean value of 1.89 ± 0.26, as reported in Fig. 5. Best-fit column density values range from 10 21 cm −2 to 10 24 cm −2 . We have upper limits for 23 sources. Twenty are unabsorbed sources with N H upper limits < 10 22 cm −2 . The two remaining sources have N H upper limits reaching into the heavily absorbed regime (∼ 10 23 −10 24 cm −2 ). These sources, ser285 and ser235, have low-count NuSTAR data and no lower energy data available. For only one source with NuSTAR-only data (ser409) we cannot constrain its N H value even when fixing Γ = 1.8. For 17 sources, ∼27% of the sample, we measure N H ≥ 10 23 cm −2 . Two sources (∼ 3% of the sample), cosmos330 and ser261, exhibit CT column densities. The former is the CT AGN discovered by C15. Fig. 5 shows Γ as a function of intrinsic N H . Error bars in Γ tend to be larger for obscured sources (i.e., N H 10 22 cm −2 ).


### Luminosity in the 10-40 keV energy band

In the last two columns of Table 5 we report the 10-40 keV luminosities from the baseline model. They are unabsorbed luminosities (L u,X , penultimate column) and intrinsic luminosities (L i,X , last column). The unabsorbed luminosity is estimated by simply removing the Galactic and intrinsic absorption components from the best-fit baseline model. The intrinsic coronal luminosities are computed from the unabsorbed coronal power-law component by simply removing the reflection contribution to the best-fit baseline model. The uncertainties in L i,X due to parameter degeneracy in our modeling are estimated by fitting the baseline model with R fixed to its lower and upper error bounds. The shaded grey histogram reports the distribution of Γ (right-hand y-axis). Data points without error-bars in Γ are sources for which the value of Γ was fixed to a value of 1.8 during the modeling because of poor constraints due to a combination of limited statistics and large column densities.

In the context of the baseline parametrization, L i,X is supposed to reflect more closely the true X-ray radiative output of the primary (direct) X-ray emitting nuclear source. Notice though that the planar geometry assumed in pexrav is an approximate description of the cold reflector which, according to unification schemes, has a toroidal geometry. In any case, in the 10-40 keV band the additional reflection contribution can become relevant compared to the intrinsic coronal one, especially for sources with low-luminosity and large reflection strengths. Including the reflection term in the luminosity calculation may lead to a "double counting" of the intrinsic X-ray radiative output. Indeed in this case the estimate of L u,X would include both the primary coronal power-law component and the primary coronal photons reflected from the circum-nuclear material back to the observer. This overestimation of the intrinsic luminosity is negligible (10-30% for R=1-6) in the 2-10 keV band where the reflection component is a few percent of the primary emission. The upper panel of Fig. 6 shows, for the 10-40 keV band, the overestimate of the "unabsorbed luminosities" including the reflection component compared to the intrinsic luminosities derived from the unabsorbed primary component only. In the lower panel we report the ratio between these two quantities in order to quantify better the level of overestimation. L u,X can be larger by factors up to ∼ 2 − 4 and the majority of those sources are those with best-fit R > 1 (red diamonds) at low luminosity (i.e., L i,X < ∼ 2 × 10 44 erg s −1 ). This is due to an induced dependence between R and luminosity which, if not accounted for, may lead to a biased view of the relationship between luminosity and reflection strength (see Section 4.5.1 and Fig. 8, bottom panels). Notice that few sources at higher luminosities ( > ∼ 2 × 10 44 erg s −1 ) have overestimates of a factor of ∼ 2 even though they have low reflection strenghts (i.e., R < 1). This is due to the fact that the L u,X /L i,X ratio in the observed 10-40 keV energy range is an increasing function of the redshift 9 and our sample, selected in flux, contains, on average, higher luminosity sources at higher redshifts.

In order to keep the baseline parametrization simple and suitable for low SNR spectra we did not include a Compton-scattering term which can become important for the most obscured sources. This may lead to an underestimate of the true luminosity for the most obscured sources. We compared our unabsorbed values with the best-fit values obtained by adding a Comptonscattering term parametrized with cabs for the COS-MOS sources with log(N H /cm −2 ) > ∼ 24, i.e. those for which we have the best-quality broad-band data. We obtained, on average, larger luminosities with values ranging from < 0.1 dex for the less obscured sources up to ∼ 0.4 dex for the most obscured ones. However, cabs approximates the Compton-scattering by only accounting for the scattering of the photons outside of the beam and neglecting photons reflected by surrounding material into the line-of-sight. Hence more appropriate luminosity values may be estimated by accounting for the geometry of the obscurer. For this reason we compared our values with those obtained with the torus modelings employed in Section 4.6 which self-consistently account for Compton-scattering effects due to the toroidal geometry of the obscurer. We found that in the range log(N H /cm −2 ) ≈ 23 − 24.5, the 10-40 keV luminosity is underestimated on average by at most ∼ 0.1 dex with only two exceptions in our sample: cosmos129 and ser261. These sources are among the most obscured sources in our sample and for them we are finding L u,X underestimated by 0.2 dex and 0.3-0.4 dex, respectively. No significant difference is found for less-obscured sources.

9 Indeed the redshift progressively shifts to lower energies (i.e., outside the band) portions of the spectrum where the decreasing primary component still significantly contribute to the total flux.  Table 5 continued 


### The reflection component

We next estimate the significance of the reflection component in our sources. We first evaluated if for the obscured sources (log[N H /cm −2 ] ≥ 22) the absorbed spectral shape could be better modelled in the context of a CT scenario in which the primary continuum is completely suppressed and where the only dominant component other than the soft residual scattered one is the pure cold reflection component. Hence we evaluated a reflection-dominated spectrum obtained by removing the absorbed primary power-law component from the baseline model. Since we are not using χ 2 statitics, we are not able to use an F-test to evaluate the significance of the baseline model over the simpler reflectiondominated one. We therefore based our evaluation on the presence of: 1) a reasonable input power-law photon index for the pexrav component of the best-fit parametrization of the reflection dominated model; 2) a large fraction of scattered flux at low energies for the baseline model 10 ; 3) the presence of an Fe Kα emission 10 I.e., if we are modeling an intrinsic reflection-dominated source with the baseline model, we obtain an overestimate of this quantity. To check for this we tied Γ of the scattered component line with a large equivalent width (EW > ∼ 1 keV); and 4) large residuals for the best-fit parametrization. Based on these criteria, we did not find clear cases of sources deviating from the baseline model or significantly better parametrized by a reflection-dominated model. Similarly we did not find scattered fractions in excess of a few percent, the value that is typically found in heavily obscured sources (e.g. Lanzuisi et al. 2015). Moreover, only for cosmos181 we obtained Fe Kα EW ∼ 1 keV. Other sources show more moderate EWs. We therefore are unable to discriminate between the two models.


#### Reflection as a function of obscuration, slope and luminosity of the primary emission

We measured R for all the sources (see Table 5 column 6) and obtained upper limits for 23 sources. We considered as upper limits all the best-fit values with R < 0.01. In Fig. 7 we report the distribution of R in bins of 0.5 dex 11 .

to the primary one.

11 Notice that the derived R values are obtained by fixing the inclination angle (θ incl ) for the reflector to θ incl ∼ 63 • (default in Xspec). Assuming lower/larger inclination angles will decrease/increase R. For instance fixing θ incl = 30 • (θ incl = 85 • ) We investigated how reflection correlates with obscuration and luminosity for the whole sample. Fig. 8 presents the reflection parameter as a function of column density (top-left panel) and unabsorbed and intrinsic 10-40 keV luminosity (bottom panels). The color of each point corresponds to redshift with the redder colors representing the more distant sources. Since ours is a flux-selected sample, more distant (i.e., redder) sources in the R − L X plane correspond to more luminous, less obscured sources (i.e., see R − N H plane).

There is an apparent tendency for obscured and luminous sources to have, on average, maximum R values smaller than unobscured and less luminous sources.

We investigated and quantified these trends by: (1) computing the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ) for censored data using the ASURV package v. 1.2 (Lavalley et al. 1992;Feigelson & Nelson 1985;Isobe et al. 1986) and (2) calculating the median R and its interquartile range (IQR) for the entire sample and the obscured/unobscured and luminous/less luminous sub-samples (the separation between the latter being dictated by the median luminosities of the sample, would lower (increase) our reported R by 50% (a factor of 2-3).  c We used a 10 22 cm −2 threshold value.

d The median value log( Lu,X /ergs −1 ) = 44.35 is adopted as the threshold value. e The median value log( Li,X /ergs −1 ) = 44.06 is adopted as the threshold value.

For the latter we accounted for measurement errors and upper limits in R, log(N H /cm −2 ) and logL i,X as follows: we performed 10000 realizations of the sample each time with Gaussian and uniform randomization for respectively each of the parameter best-fit values 12 and the upper limits. In the case of R and logN H , the latter were randomized from their 90% upper value down to a fixed minimum value of R = 0.01 and log(N H /cm −2 ) = 20. We computed for each realization the median value and IQR, and adopted as representative for the sample the averaged values over all the realizations. The resulting values are reported in Table 6. Note that accounting for the upper limits may lead to a shift of the lower interquartile bound toward smaller values. Therefore the lower interquartile range may not reflect the true relative R distributions. The IQR values are reported as shaded areas in Fig. 8 for the sub-samples and vertical lines for the entire sample.

For the entire sample, the average median value is R = 0.43 with an interquartile range 0.06 − 1.50. We find a weak mildly significant anti-correlation between . Therefore the dependence of R on luminosity (see below) should not affect our result. We checked for the possibility that the resulting trend is due to the covariance in our modeling at the highest column densities between the two quantities. We computed the confidence contours for N H and R for the heavily obscured sources (i.e., log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 23) and we find no significant covariance with few sources showing weak covariance which has been found to be either positive (cosmos181 and cosmos216) or negative (ser243 and ser254). If the anti-correlation between R and logN H is real, it could be explained by a configuration in which the obscurer absorbs also the reflected component. Hence a more pronounced reflection is necessary to reproduce the observed high energy spectral shape. This would bring the reflection parameters to higher values for the obscured AGN (log[N H /cm −2 ] ≥ 22) in agreement with those derived for the unabsorbed sources. Hence we estimated R and logN H best-fit values by performing modeling on the obscured AGN with a modified baseline model in which the reflection component is absorbed by the same column density absorbing the power-law continuum. We obtained R = 0.14 and IQR= 0.02 − 0.93 which is not dissimilar to the values obtained by the baseline model. We also estimated the correlation between the two quantities and obtained ρ = −0.19 with p = 0.147. Hence although a weak anticorrelation still persists, it is not significant. We therefore cannot make significant claims about this hypothesis. We mention that accounting for Compton-scattering in our baseline model may affect the determination of R for the most absorbed sources. We measured this for the most obscured sources in the COSMOS sub-sample (i.e., cosmos330, cosmos181, cosmos216 and cosmos129) and found R values which are lower but always in agreement with those from the baseline model within the 1σ uncertainties. The inclusion of a Compton-scattering term will, on average, lower the median R value for the log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 sources and increase the disagreement compared to the unobscured sources (i.e., strenghten the anti-correlation). R may be partially degenerate with Γ in our modeling. We investigated this induced effect in the R − Γ plane (see Fig. 8, top right panel). There is a significant correlation between the two quantities with ρ = 0.54 and a null-hypothesis probability p = 10 −4 . We find similar trends with obscuration at a lower significance level. Notice that our evaluation in this case is both affected by the small number of sources in the obscured and unobscured sample and for the obscured sources by the many sources with Γ = 1.8 fixed which we had to exclude from the analysis. Therefore we cannot draw firm conclusions on this point. A pronounced degree of degeneracy between the two parameters has also been found through spectral stacking analysis in our companion paper (DM17) using a sample three times larger than ours.

As for the relation with luminosity, we find a significant anti-correlation for both L u,X and L i,X (see Fig. 8, bottom panels). The correlation coefficient for the former quantity is ρ = −0.37 with p = 3.9 × 10 −3 while for the latter is ρ = −0.59 with p < 1 × 10 −5 . The stronger correlation with L i,X is expected given that L u,X includes a contribution from the reflection component itself which partially mitigates the "true" relation. The stronger correlation of L i,X − R compared to L u,X − R reflects also in the median and IQR values as shown in Table 6. The median and upper IQR bound values for luminous and less-luminous sources differ respectively Colors reflect the redshift of each source, with redder colors representing more distant objects. In the R vs. LX and R vs. Γ plots, empty (filled) circles represent unobscured (obscured) AGN. Vertical lines mark the interquartile interval for R in the entire sample. Shaded green (yellow) regions represent the interquartile ranges for obscured (unobscured) and more (less) luminous sources (the latter being separated at a median luminosity). In the R vs. luminosity and R vs. NH plots the red star represents the high-redshift quasar detected in the ECDF-S field and analyzed in Del Moro et al. (2014). The hatched regions in the R vs. Lu,X represent 90% error range for bins in NH and LX as measured from the stacking analysis performed by DM17 on a large sample of NuSTAR-detected sources. Values of interquartile ranges are reported also in Table 6. See Section 4.4 for the definition of Lu,X and Li,X . by a factor of > ∼ 4 and > ∼ 2. These trends are not particularly sensitive to the luminosity value adopted to separate the two subsamples: less luminous sources always exhibit more pronounced reflection than luminous ones. For example, a change in L i,X threshold values by ±50% translates into a > ∼ 3 − 5 factor difference in median and upper bound R values. A z = 2 quasar selected in the NuSTAR-ECDF-S field and analyzed in Del Moro et al. (2014) is reported in the plots as the starred data point. This source shows a low degree of reflection, comparable to the luminous/obscured AGN in our sample. Notice that we are using a flux-limited sample. Hence the more luminous sources are also on average the more distant ones. Indeed the sources brighter than the median intrinsic luminosity of the sample have median redshifts of z hi−z > ∼ 0.9 while the less luminous ones have z hi−z > ∼ 0.25. Hence it is also possible that the main driver of the correlation between luminosity and R is the redshift. With this sample we are not able to break the degeneracy between luminosity and redshift in order to investigate this scenario.

In our companion paper (DM17) we analyze, through stacking techniques, the average spectral properties of the 182 AGN detected in the medium-deep NuSTAR surveys. This sample is three times larger than the one used on that work with a slight overlap (for one sixth of the sources) with our sample. The average reflection strength is found to be R ≈ 0.5 (Γ = 1.8 fixed) with hard-band detected sources showing a slightly higher value R ≈ 0.7 (for Γ = 1.8 fixed, R < 0.4 when leaving Γ free to vary). These values are in good agreement with our R and within the scatter suggested by the interquartile range. The derived R values as a function of unabsorbed luminosity L u,X and column density are in good agreement with those inferred for our sample. This can be seen in Fig. 8 (bottom left panel) where the 90% error range in R, accounting for the degeneracy with Γ (i.e., reporting ranges according to the average Γ we measured in our sub-samples), is reported as hatched grey regions.

Our combined analysis of the NuSTAR sources gives an indication of the average R values (from DM17) and of their dispersion among different sources (from this work) as a function of luminosity and column density for the intermediate redshift ( z = 0.5 − 1) AGN population.

Our findings are also consistent with previous results showing low levels of reflection for high-redshift quasars (Vignali et al. 1999;Reeves & Turner 2000;Page et al. 2005) though note that Ricci et al. (2011) found higher levels of reflection from Seyfert 2s compared to Seyfert 1s. Fig. 8 (bottom panels) shows unobscured and obscured sources as empty and filled data points, respectively, and does not allow a firm conclusion on this point for Seyfert-like luminosity sources.


### Physically motivated models for the obscured sources

To constrain the spectral parameters we also adopted two physically motivated, Monte Carlo models which self-consistently account for the toroidal geometry of the obscuring/reflecting medium and properly treat continuum suppression due to the additional contribution of Compton-scattering at the highest column densities. The latter contribution, if neglected, can lead to an overestimation of the column density of the obscuring medium.

The models used MYTorus assumes a proper torus geometry with a half-opening angle θ oa = 60 deg (i.e., a covering factor of 0.5). The torus geometry in BNTorus is approximated as a sphere with variable polar conical openings. We apply these models to the obscured sources (i.e., those found to have column density values or upper/lower limits consistent with log[N H /cm −2 ] 22, including ser409 for which N H was unconstrained) as estimated by the baseline model (see Table 5) with the aim of comparing the N H values. We assume and edge-on orientation with inclination angle 85 deg. For the low SNR spectra with unconstrained photon indices we fix Γ = 1.8. b Units of 10 −13 erg s −1 cm −2 .

c Unabsorbed 10-40 keV luminosity in units of erg s −1 .

The best-fit parameters are reported in Table 7. For both models there is broad agreement in N H and Γ with the baseline model. Indeed we have 15 and 16 sources, ∼25% of the sample, in the log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23−24 bin for BNTorus and MYTorus respectively 13 . For the two sources having best-fit N H values in the CT regime from the baseline model, cosmos330 and ser261, the latter has the lowest SNR NuSTAR-only spectrum in the 13 Furthermore both modelings have an additional source with estimated N H consistent within 1σ with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 23. sample, and it is not confirmed to be CT. Indeed the estimated lower limits on N H for both torus models are in the heavily obscured range log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23 − 24. Therefore, the source could still be CT. The other two sources having upper limits in the CT regime from the baseline model, ser285 and ser235, typically have upper limits in the heavily obscured range for both models,the exception being ser235 for which MYTorus gives an upper limit in the CT range. Figure 9 shows a comparison between column densities derived from both models. For the BNTorus model (empty circles) there is good agreement, although with a tendency to estimate sys-tematically slightly lower N H values 14 . Red dots report the best fit N H values from MYTorus, which also show good agreement. Given the mild disagreement regarding N H for the two CT sources as estimated by the baseline model, we further modify the primary power-law in the baseline model with an approximated Comptonscattering term parametrized in XSPEC with the cabs model. Both sources are still reported to be CT. This highlights the need to account for accurate Compton scattering treatment and geometry-dependent effects, as provided by the torus modelings, in order to get an accurate estimate of the column density for the most obscured AGN.


## OBSERVED N H DISTRIBUTION

The distribution of N H derived from photoelectric absorption as evaluated by the baseline model (Section 4.2) for 62 out of 63 sources is shown in the histograms reported in Fig. 10 (upper panel). The empty histogram reports sources for which N H is constrained at least at the 1σ level with errorbars computed following Poisson counting statistics (Gehrels 1986). The filled green histogram reports sources with 90% upper limits on N H . For the latter, two sources have very high (i.e., poorly constrained) column density upper limits in the range log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23 − 25 (one in the CT range). These are sources with NuSTAR-only X-ray data available and for which the missing coverage at lower X-ray energies limits our ability to measure lower column densities. We find two sources (cosmos330 and ser261) in the CT range. However the torus modeling finds a lower number of CT AGN. Only cosmos330 is formally considered as such by BNTorus. MYTorus finds it to be slightly below the the CT range. For ser261 both models place a lower limit in the heavily obscured regime (log[N H /cm −2 ] = 23 − 24) for the low-quality spectrum of ser261 (see Fig. 9). Both models place an upper limit in the CT regime for only one source: ser409 for BN-Torus (this source has N H unconstrainted by the baseline modeling) and ser235 for MYTorus.

We build a histogram of the column-density distribution of the sample by folding in the error information in N H best-fit values and the 90% upper limits. In order to do this, in analogy with Section 4.5, we performed 1000 random realizations of the sample. We assume symmetric Gaussian distributions in logN H with 1σ standard deviations as the mean of the lower and upper errors. For sources with upper limits in logN H we assume a smooth uniform random distribution down to Figure 10. Upper panel: column density distribution from the baseline spectral model (black histogram) with error bars calculated assuming low counting statistics. Shaded green histogram reports 90% upper limits for data sets with limited constraining power (i.e., high-redshift, low NH or sources with only NuSTAR spectra). Lower panel: Black line shows the distribution in which the NH best-fit values and upper limits from the baseline model have been randomized as described in Section 5. In green is shown the range of NH distribution by substituting the baseline-derived measurements for the sources with log(NH/cm −2 ) ≥ 23 with those derived by adopting the torus models. Red (long dashed), blue (dashed) and magenta (dot dashed) histograms are model predictions from G07 and BA11 using the U14 XLF and Treister et al. (2009). log(N H /cm −2 ) = 20 cm −2 . We then averaged the resulting N H distributions and obtained the randomized histogram reported in black in Fig. 10 (lower panel). Notice that this procedure, because of the upper limits, may lead to an overestimate of the log(N H /cm −2 ) = 20 − 21 numbers due to the contributions from the sources with upper limits in the log(N H /cm −2 ) = 21 − 22 bin (some may really belong to this bin but are averaged over all the log[N H /cm −2 ] = 20 − 22 range). We also accounted for the N H values obtained by the torus modeling. We substituted them for the sources with baseline-derived N H measurements in excess of 10 23 cm −2 . Fig. 10 shows the torus-derived N H distribution (and its range) in green. There is very little difference with those derived with the baseline values.

We compared the randomized N H distributions with the prediction from theoretical models (dashed histograms in figure) by G07 (red long dashed), Treister et al. (2009) (magenta dot dashed) and BA11 (blue short dashed), updated with the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF) of Ueda et al. 2014 (hereafter BA11+U14) folded with the sky coverage of our survey ( Fig. 1) at fluxes above the threshold set for selecting the sample (S 8−24 ≥ 7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 ). All models predict a total number of sources which is slightly smaller compared those in the randomized histogram. However they are all roughly consistent within the Poissonian errors. Specifically we have above threshold a total of 57 sources, while G07, Treister et al. (2009) and BA11+U14 predict 52.7, 46 and 52.5, respectively. There is fair agreement within the uncertainties between the models and our randomized histogram for the obscured sources. As for the unobscured sources (log[N H /cm −2 ] ≤ 22) the anomalous low value of the G07 model at log(N H /cm −2 ) = 21 − 22, as reported by Gilli et al. (2007) themselves, seems to be due to the assumed XLF for type-1 AGNs (from Hasinger et al. 2005) which probably is contaminated at the level of 10-20% by mildly obscured (log[N H /cm −2 ] = 21 − 22) sources and makes the transition to the log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 sources unrealistically steep. Correcting for a 10-20% contamination alleviates the disagreement with our data at 1.5-2.1σ level. Also Treister et al. (2009) predicts a very small number of sources at log(N H /cm −2 ) = 21 − 22. This may probably be due to the fact that in this regime the host galaxy obscuration plays a nonnegligible role. This further extra-nuclear absorption component is not accounted for in the model.


## INTRINSIC N H DISTRIBUTION AND FRACTION OF CT AGN

Both models in Fig. 10 agree with our data and predict a very low number (∼1-4) of CT AGNs in our hard selected sample. This is a consequence of the fact that the 8 − 24 keV NuSTAR band is still biased against extremely obscured sources. This bias depends primarily on the redshift of the sources, on the width and highenergy bound of the range used for selecting the sources and on the value of the instrumental effective area at the energies where CT sources mostly emit. Fig. 11 highlights this for a BNTorus model 15 with Γ = 1.8 by showing the "absorption bias" B(logN H , z), i.e. the ratio between observed and intrinsic 8-24 keV NuSTAR count-rates as a function of the absorbing column density. The different black curves show this bias for the 8-24 keV band at redshifts 0, 0.58 (the median redshift of our sample), 1.0, 1.5 (respectively solid, long dashed, short dashed and dotted lines) for a torus with θ oa = 60 deg. The bias for a fixed N H decreases with redshift. In grey we show the bias for θ oa = 30 deg 15 The adoption of BNTorus (which is assumed representative for the toroidal models) instead of the baseline model is due to the fact that at high N H it allows a more accurate estimate of the bias. At low N H they both predict very negligible bias.

(hereafter BNTorus30). In the lower panel we report the ratio between the bias among the two opening angles. A smaller opening angle of the torus tends to give less bias. Given the fact that NuSTAR probes non-local sources up to z ≈ 2 − 3 we infer that NuSTAR has, on average, roughly the same absorption bias as Swift-BAT, at these flux levels.

For the unobscured sources the hard NuSTAR band is not biased at any redshift. The following considerations take as reference the absorption bias with θ oa = 60 deg. This will weight more the heavily absorbed sources when correcting for it. We later discuss possible changes in our estimates when using a bias given by the BNTorus30 case. At larger column densities the bias is more evident for increasing N H . It becomes more pronounced for the CT sources (from 0.4-0.7 depending on redshift to less than 0.2). This means that while we detect all the unobscured sources at intrinsic fluxes down to S 8−24 ≈ 7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 , for the CT sources we are sensitive to sources with intrinsic fluxes in the range ∼ 1 − 3 × 10 −13 erg s −1 cm −2 , therefore missing a sizable fraction of the CT AGN population at fainter intrinsic (i.e., unabsorbed) fluxes. We can recover the missing AGN population by computing the intrinsic N H distribution down to a certain intrinsic (i.e. unabsorbed) flux level common to all the sources regardless of their column density. Following Burlon et al. (2011), we integrate the source counts dN/dS derived in each 1 dex logN H bin (see Section 8) from a minimum (S obs min ) to a maximum (S obs max ) observed flux as follows:
dN dlogN H = Smax S obs min =S intr min ×B(log NH,z) dN dS (log N H )dS
where B(log N H , z) depends on N H and on the mean redshift of the sources in each logN H bin and S intr min is the minimum intrinsic (i.e. absorption-corrected) source flux at which the intrinsic distribution is estimated. In order to derive the source counts in each logN H accounting for uncertainties in N H , we applied, through 10000 realizations of the sample, the same randomization procedure for error and upper/lower limits as explained for the observed N H distribution Section 5. We model the derived logN -logS in each realization as a power-law with slope α and normalization K and adopted as representative for each bin their median values among all the realizations. These best-fit values are reported in Table 8. The derived slopes are all consistent within the uncertainties with the 3/2 Euclidean value for a uniform non-evolving Universe. A small amount of realizations (at percent level) gave no sources in the CT bin hence in these cases no source count could be computed. Given their paucity we neglected these cases 16 . We derived the distributions for N H estimated by (i) baselineonly modeling and (ii) baseline model for sources with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≤ 23 and BNTorus model for more obscured sources. The latter case has been considered in order to include more accurate N H estimates at the highest column densities (see Fig. 9). The value of S intr min is chosen so that we are sensitive according to B(log N H , z) to the same intrinsic flux to all the sources regardless of their N H . This parameter is critical for deriving a CT fraction with reliable uncertainties. Indeed in the CT bin B(log N H , z) may vary by a factor of 4-6 according to the exact value of N H (see Fig. 11). Given that we have only a couple of CT sources, one of which (ser261) has large errors and in the torus models is not even considered a bona fide CT, the choice of S intr min is subject to large uncertainties. For determining it we therefore relied on the ∼ 10 sources which within their uncertainties have N H compatible with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≈ 24. We verified, through 1000 realizations of the sample, that accounting for the flux uncertainties and adopting an absorption bias relative to the redshift of each source and its randomized N H (we are excluding objects with upper limits whose absorption bias and therefore Figure 12. Intrinsic NH distributions (upper panel) and fraction relative to the total number of objects in the intrinsic distribution (shaded grey, lower panel). The distributions presented here are for NH derived by the baseline model except for the heavily obscured sources (i.e. log[NH/cm −2 ] ≥ 23) for which the BNTorus model estimates are adopted. Error-bars reflect the low counting statistics of the observed NH distribution (Fig. 10). The shaded grey and hatched dark grey regions represent the 1σ range of derived fractions assuming different absorption bias corrections with θoa in the BNTorus model of 60 deg and 30 deg, respectively (see Fig. 11). In the log(NH/cm −2 ) = 24 − 25 bin we reported as dotted lines also the 90% upper limits. Model predictions from G07, U14 and Aird et al. (2015a) are shown in dotdashed green, long dashed orange and short dashed blue, respectively.

intrinsic flux cannot be realiably estimated), a flux of S intr min = 10 −13 erg s −1 cm −2 is adequate for our purposes. In this way we estimate the intrinsic N H distribution of the population of AGNs down to this intrinsic flux. In the integration we are assuming, as representative for each bin, the value of the absorption bias relative to the central logN H value at the mean redshift of each bin. This sets in each bin a representative value of S obs min to perform the integration of the source-counts. This has non-negligible implications in the CT bin where the absorption bias, being strongly dependent on logN H , makes the estimation of S obs min highly uncertain. Given the paucity of possible CT AGN in our CT bin which possibly reflects the distribution of CT sources at "intrinsic" fluxes of 10 −13 erg s −1 cm −2 , and given that they have column densities close to log(N H /cm −2 ) = 24, we have decided to use for the CT bin an absorption bias relative to N H = 1.5 × 10 24 cm −2 (i.e. the formal threshold for defining a source as CT). The derived distribution is reported in the histograms of Fig. 12, where the N H estimates for the more obscured sources are from BNTorus. Notice that the reported distributions for baseline-only N H estimates are very similar providing only slightly higher estimates in the CT bin. The errorbars reflect the low counting statistics on the number of sources whose unabsorbed flux is above S intr min in each bin. In the upper panel we report the intrinsic distribution using normalizations derived from the source counts fits to all the sources in 1 dex logN H intervals (see Table 8) and assuming an Euclidean slope 17 . In the lower panel we report the fractional number of AGN in each bin relative to the total number of sources at log(N H /cm −2 ) < 24 (f 20−24 ) from the intrinsic distribution. The shaded grey region is the 1σ range obtained through error propagation from the intrinsic N H distribution uncertainties. We report also in hatched dark grey regions the fractional distributions assuming an absorption bias derived by BNTorus30 (see grey lines in 


## FRACTION OF ABSORBED SOURCES

Clear trends in the fraction of absorbed AGNs (f abs ) compared to the whole population have been found with redshift and luminosity. Indeed several authors report a decrease in the absorbed AGN population with source luminosity (e.g., Lawrence & Elvis 1982;Steffen et al. 2003;La Franca et al. 2005;Sazonov et al. 2007;Della Ceca et al. 2008;Burlon et al. 2011) and an increase with redshift at fixed X-ray luminosity (e.g., La Franca et al. 2005;Ballantyne et al. 2006;Treister & Urry 2006;Vito et al. 2014;Ueda et al. 2014). Our spectral analysis effectively probes restframe ∼ 1.2−24 keV for all the sources given the redshift distribution from z > ∼ 0 up to z ≈ 1.5. It can therefore account globally for the most relevant spectral complexity measurable in X-ray AGN spectra and allows an accurate determination of the absorbing column density. For this reason we estimated the fraction of absorbed sources as a function of X-ray luminosity and redshift. Given that at the highest absorptions (i.e. at CT column densities) our survey is biased, we chose to neglect these sources and estimate fraction of absorbed Compton Thin AGN.

Because of the selection of our sample we must correct our observed number of absorbed sources for the fact that AGN with a given intrinsic luminosity are progressively missed in the surveyed field for increasing column densities at larger distances. This translates to larger cosmic volumes sampled for unobscured sources compared to obscured ones. To account for this selection effect, for each source we computed the maximum surveyable comoving volume (V max , Schmidt 1968;Page & Carrera 2000) accounting for its observed (i.e., absorbed) luminosity (L obs x ) and survey sky-coverage Ω(S) using the following formula:
V max = zmax zmin=0 Ω(S(L obs x , z)) dV dz dz
where z max is chosen so that S(L obs x , z max ) = 7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 in the 8-24 keV band. The intrinsic fraction of obscured sources is therefore estimated as the ratio of the summed space densities of absorbed sources over the space densities of the total population:
f NH = NN H i=1 (V i max ) −1 Ntot i=1 (V i max ) −1
where N tot and N NH are, respectively, the total number of sources and the number of sources characterized by a column density larger than a given N H value. Notice that in our calculation we use parameters derived from the baseline modeling except for the heavily absorbed sources (log[N H /cm −2 ] ≥ 23) for which more accurate results from BNTorus have been incorporated. The uncertainty on F NH is obtained by error propagation of the uncertainties on (V max ) −1 . The latter is usually estimated as i (V i max ) −2 (Marshall 1985) by assuming Gaussian statistics in each bin. Since we are dealing with a relatively small number of sources per bin, this uncertainty estimate is not optimal in our case. We therefore estimate uncertainties through bootstrap resampling 19 in each luminosity bin. Notice that in this case we are not correcting for the absorption bias as log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23 − 24 sources show little bias (see Fig. 11) and the small number of AGN in each bin is the dominant source of uncertainty. Fig. 13 shows the fraction of absorbed sources with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 (f 22 ) as a function of the unabsorbed 10-40 keV luminosity. We adopt as fiducial values those estimated from the bootstrap resampling procedure. We use the unabsorbed luminosity instead of the intrinsic coronal one in order to be consistent in comparing our results with those derived by previous works. Furthermore there is no comparable intrinsic luminosity quantity for the BNTorus-modelled heavily absorbed sources. In order to ensure good statistics and minimize the effects from single sources (i.e., outliers) we divide the sample in two bins, each containing a comparable number of objects. The size and color of each point gives an indication of the relative median redshift of the sources contributing to each bin, with the redder, smaller point sampling, on average, more distant sources.


### Fraction as a function of luminosity

We see a hint of a decreasing trend of f 22 with luminosity. This dependence, is however not very significant being consistent within the uncertainties with no dependence with luminosity. Given the large range in redshift covered by our sample it is possible that the redshift evolution in the fractions act at the highest luminosities 19 For each bin we performed 10000 random resamplings to derive the absorbed fractions and their standard deviation.

(where we have the more luminous sources) partially masking the luminosity dependence. The small number of sources prevent us from drawing firm conclusions on this point. In any case our estimated values are perfectly consistent with population-synthesis model predictions not incorporating redshift evolution (G07 and Akylas et al. 2012). Given that 80% of the sources are at z < ∼ 1 and that 90% of the contribution to the high luminosity bin comes from sources at z ≈ 0.3 − 1.1 we can compare our results with recent determinations at similar redshifts. We find broad consistency with the estimated fractions for Compton Thin sources reported by Ueda et al. (2014) and Buchner et al. (2015) for z = 0.1 − 1 and z = 0.5 − 0.75, respectively.

To give an idea of the variance of our results on the adopted binning, we adjusted the bin width in order to include up to 8 more sources (i.e. increasing the number of sources by ∼25%) and reported the range of the corresponding variations as grey regions. We find very stable results on the fraction for low luminosity sources and a much broader range for high luminosity sources. Notice though that our nominal high luminosity fractions are at the upper end of this range. This is an indication that possibly the fractions at higher luminosities are somewhat smaller than estimated.

Our absorption fraction calculation has been obtained through the estimation of the space densities in the two bins. For the low luminosity bin including sources in the redshift range 20 z ≈ 0.1 − 0.25 we obtain total and absorbed space densities of 4.7 ± 1.5 × 10 −5 Mpc −1 and 2.9 ± 1.3 × 10 −5 Mpc −1 . For the high luminosity bin including sources at z ≈ 0.3 − 1 we obtain 1.8 ± 0.2 × 10 −6 Mpc −1 and 8.6 ± 2.5 × 10 −7 Mpc −1 for total and absorbed sources. It is difficult to compare these values to other results given the small number of sources we have and that our choice of luminosity intervals is driven by the need to maximize the statistics in each bin making also the redshift intervals equally poorly defined and luminosity dependent. In any case the total values are in fair agreement with the models from U14 and Aird et al. (2015b).


### Fraction as a function of redshift

Recently Liu et al. (2017) performed a spectral analysis of the brightest AGN in the 7 Ms CDF-S and investigated f 22 as a function of redshift. They divided their sample in redshift bins in the range z = 0.8−3.5 at fixed 2-10 keV luminosities log(L 2−10 /erg s −1 ) = 43.5 − 44.2. They evaluated that these objects are not biased by absorption up to log(N H /cm −2 ) = 24. In order to com-pare with their estimates we measured the absorption fraction in the same luminosity range for sources in the redshift interval z=0.1-0.5. According to their criterion this sub-sample is not biased for log(N H /cm −2 ) < 24 21 . We obtain an absorption fraction of f 22 = 0.30 ± 0.17. In Fig. 14 we compare our value with those measured by Liu et al. (2017) for the sub-sample of sources with spectroscopic redshift determinations. We report also the best-fit relative to their whole sample. Our low value nicely follows the monotonic trend with redshift reported by Liu et al. (2017) at higher redshifts. Notice that they had in each bin only 12 sources. In any case their estimates broadly agree by those inferred by the entire sample (which includes sources with photometric redshifts) for which they have bins populated by 17-26 sources. Given that our sub-sample consists of only 11 sources, we decided to explore the robustness of our measure by including neighbouring sources (enlarging the sub-sample to up to 16 sources) by modifying the luminosity and redshift boundaries by ±0.15 dex and ±0.05, respectively. The range of possible variation of f 22 is reported in Fig. 14 by the shaded grey area. We also report relatively local (i.e. z < 1) fractions by U14 and Buchner et al. (2015). Their fractions measured at, on average, higher redshift ranges, lie at slightly higher f 22 than our point.


## SOURCE COUNTS AS A FUNCTION OF N H

Given that population-synthesis models reproduce the CXB as a mixture of AGN with different column densities we can analyze the source counts as a function of N H and compare them with model predictions. The latter starts to noticeably differentiate at higher column densities, with the largest difference in the CT regime.

Using the 8 − 24 keV sensitivity curves reported in Fig. 1 we first produced the total source counts 22 for our sample. We model them as a simple power-law K S −α given that our sources, having the highest hardband fluxes in the NuSTAR-Extragalactic Survey program (H16), still probe fluxes well above the break at log(S 8−24 /erg s −1 cm −2 ) ≃ −14 predicted by background synthesis models (e.g., G07, BA11). We employed a maximum likelihood estimator (Crawford et al. 1970) to obtain, through a fit to the unbinned differential counts, the best-fit value of the slope α of the integral counts. The normalization of the power-law is Figure 14. Compton thin absorbed fractions as a function of redshift. For log(Lu,X/erg s −1 ) ≈ 43.6 − 44.3 (corresponding to the 2-10 keV log(L2−10/erg s −1 ) ≈ 43.5 − 44.2, assuming for the conversion an unabsorbed power-law with Γ = 1.8). Black is the absorbed fraction estimated from our sample. Blue, green and orange are absorbed fractions obtained by the spectroscopic sample in Liu et al. (2017), U14 andBuchner et al. (2015), respectively (the latter reported at log(Lu,X /erg s −1 ) ≈ 43.7 − 44.1). The grey shaded region is relative to our data point and gives an indication of the robustness of the estimated absorbed fraction (see Section 7.2 for details). Dotted line is the best-fit model reported by Liu et al. (2017) including in the absorbed fractions also sources with photometric redshift estimates. fixed by the total number of estimated sources which should be matched by the best-fit model at the catalog lowest flux. The best-fit power-law has a slope value of α = 1.36 ± 0.28 which is flatter but still consistent with the Euclidean 3/2 value for the integral distribution and a normalization of 10.1±1.3 deg −2 at 10 −13 erg s −1 cm −2 (where the error is Poissonian from the total number of sources employed in the source counts).

We analyzed the variation of the logN -logS slope as a function of column density. In order to do this we performed a scan in N H with step 0.1 dex in logN H . For each value of column density we estimate the value of the logN -logS slope in an interval of 1 dex centered in it. We performed the usual 1000 realizations of our sample randomizing N H according to their errors and upper limit values. From each of these realizations we produce a logN -logS and obtain a best-fit value of α in each logN H bin. We construct a distribution of α and its uncertainty and assign to the bin their median values. In Fig. 15 (upper panel) we report α as a function of N H . The average number of objects included in each logN -logS interval, which is always larger than 10 for log(N H /cm −2 ) < ∼ 24, is plotted in the lower panel (along with its 1σ dispersion).

Although the values calculated in adjacent steps are correlated, this plot illustrates the robustness of the bestfit α value and its dependence on outlier objects. On scales larger than ∼ 1 dex in logN H we have an indication of uncorrelated variations of the slope as a function of N H . Throughout the range there is always consistency within the large errors with an Euclidean slope value. Table 8 reports values for α and normalization of the best-fit power-law in several logN H intervals from log(N H /cm −2 ) = 20 to log(N H /cm −2 ) = 25. Notice that fitting in separate column density bins and randomizing logN H within the uncertainties results in the sum of the normalizations from all the bins, 10.6 ± 1.4 deg −2 , which is slightly higher than the normalization obtained from the fit to the whole dataset but is consistent within the uncertainties. We notice that, with the exception of the CT sources, unobscured AGN have, on average, higher best-fit slope values (α ≈ 2 − 2.4) than obscured objects (α ≈ 1.3 − 1.5). In the middle panel of Fig. 15 we report the distribution of the median redshift values along with their interquartile range. Both α and the median redshift appear to be correlated, showing similar variations as a function of N H . Indeed, they have a Spearman correlation coefficient of ∼0.9. As expected, the median redshift of unobscured sources is larger than the sample median, meaning they comprise a large fraction of high-redshift sources. We investigated this trend by progressively removing highredshift sources. To preserve a sufficiently high number of sources (> 10) for each N H interval, we only investigated unobscured (log[N H /cm −2 ] = 20 − 22) and obscured (log[N H /cm −2 ] = 22 − 24) bins. For the unobscured sources, we find that α progressively decreases to values around ∼ 1.4 when we only consider sources at z < ∼ 0.4. For the obscured sources we notice variation around the Euclidean value across the redshift range within ∼ ±0.5, by z = 0.4. Despite models predicting that at the fluxes probed by NuSTAR logN -logS progressively flattens by going down to lower redshifts this effect is mild and not as strong as we are finding for the unobscured sources. Indeed the G07 model predicts in the flux range S 8−24 = 5 × 10 −14 − 10 −12 erg s −1 cm −2 the slope of the source counts flattens from z = 1.1 to z = 0.4, with values going from 1.6 to 1.2.

Dotted line is the Euclidean power-law model whose normalization at the lowest flux equals that estimated for the best-fit model. Red long dashed, blue short dashed and magenta dot dashed lines are predictions from G07, BA11 and Treister et al. (2009) models, respectively. (log[N H /cm −2 ] > 24).

The best-fit power-law models (accounting for N H uncertainties) for each are reported (see also Table 8) as solid lines. The dotted line represents the Euclidean power-law normalized so that it correctly predicts the total number of objects. Red long dashed, blue short dashed and magenta dot dashed lines show the predictions from G07, BA11 with U14 XLF and Treister et al. (2009) models, respectively. The discriminating power is stronger for the CT regime. However in this range we have only three objects, one of which has an upper limit and a minor contribution (during our randomization process) from less obscured objects with estimated N H close to the log(N H /cm −2 ) = 24. The uncertainties are very large (see Table 8). The models predictions are all roughly consistent with the source counts within the uncertainties, hence we cannot discriminate between models and draw firm conclusions. 9. DISCUSSION 9.1. Sifting through candidate CT sources Fig. 10 displays, regardless of the spectral modeling adopted, a high fraction (∼ 25%) of heavily absorbed (log[N H /cm −2 ] ≥ 23). Among these sources we report one source from the NuSTAR-COSMOS field (cosmos330) which is a bona fide CT and one source (ser261) from the Serendipitous fields which has an estimate compatible with being CT (i.e. either CT in the baseline model or 90% lower-limit in the range log[N H /cm −2 ] ≈ 23.7 − 23.8 from the toroidal modelings). Accounting for the uncertainties we have an equivalent number of 1.5-2 CT which within the poissonian uncertainties is fully consistent with the ∼0.4-3.3 CT sources (log[N H /cm −2 ] = 24 − 25) predicted to be observed in our survey by CXB population synthesis models (Fig. 10, bottom panel). 9.1.1. Claimed CT candidates in the COSMOS field and their impact on the observed CT budget Nonetheless in our sample we have sources from the COSMOS field classified as heavily absorbed which are in common with works focusing on Chandra (Brightman et al. 2014) and XMM-Newton (Lanzuisi et al. 2015) spectral analysis and which where claimed to be CT: cosmos181 and cosmos216. The spectra and the best fit models for these sources are reported in Fig. 4.

This disagreement is not unusual, several works using low-energy data have so far attempted the spectral identification of distant CT sources in the medium/deep survey fields (e.g. Tozzi et al. 2006;Georgantopoulos et al. 2007Georgantopoulos et al. , 2009Georgantopoulos et al. , 2013Comastri et al. 2011;Feruglio et al. 2011;Brightman & Ueda 2012;Buchner et al. 2014;Brightman et al. 2014;Lanzuisi et al. 2015) and given the range of possible spectral shapes for CT sources and the limited counting statistics (from few tens to ∼ 100 counts) for these faint sources especially at the highest energies > ∼ 5 − 6 keV where the effective area starts to drop, they have always struggled to consistently identify CT sources (see, e.g., Castelló-Mor et al. 2013). Moreover, their analysis, at least for sources with redshifts ≪ 2 (i.e., the great majority of the potential contributors to the CXB according to population-synthesis models), have been limited by sampling of the restricted lower energy part of the reflection component and of the heavily obscured primary emission. This may potentially add possibly non negligible systematic uncertainties to the statistical ones. Interestingly Marchesi et al. (2018, submitted) analyzing 30 local candidate CT AGN selected from the Swift/BAT 100-month survey, found that the addition of NuSTAR data allowed a re-classification of ∼ 40% of the sources as Compton thin. Source variability may furthermore play a role since these surveys have gathered data over time scales of years (e.g., Lanzuisi et al. 2014).

It is therefore worth to further investigate these sources in order to understand if they can possibly substantially change the CT budget in our investigation.

Following Lanzuisi et al. (2015) and Brightman et al. (2014), we applied their same toroidal modeling 23 to our joint XMM-Newton/Chandra -NuSTAR datasets. The only source which resulted to have a different column density classification is cosmos181, for which we obtained log(N H /cm −2 ) = 24.01 +0.05 −0.06 but only with the Lanzuisi et al. (2015) modeling. For the other modeling and for the source cosmos216 the agreement between the measured column density is well within the 1σ ucertainties. Therefore only cosmos181 would nominally and potentially change its classification to CT due to a small increase in the estimated column density by a little more than 0.1 dex. However its addition to the CT bin do not appreciably change the column density distribution (Fig. 10, bottom panel) as the equivalent number of CT sources would raise from ∼ 2 to ∼ 2.3.


#### CT candidates in the Serendipitous catalog

In the Serendip catalog we are finding three candidates CT sources: ser261, ser235 and 409. None of these have archival low-energy data from Chandra or XMM-Newton.

The heavily absorbed nature of ser261 was established already by a simple power-law fit which returns a very flat value of Γ = 0.68 +0.28 −1.08 . The baseline model finds ser261 to be CT. The torus models return a lower N H estimate, with lower limits in the heavily absorbed range (log[N H /cm −2 ] > 23.8 for BNTorus and log[N H /cm −2 ] > 23.7 for MYTorus), i.e. they cannot confirm or reject the CT classification. Notice that from an SDSS optical spectrum taken back in 2002 the source counterpart shows evidence of broad-lines hinting to a Type 1 nature. The source X-ray spectrum is the lowest quality in our sample, with just 24 NuSTAR net-counts. Clearly a much better NuSTAR spectrum, low-energy X-ray data and newer optical spectra are needed to better understand the true nature of this source.

As for the border-line source ser235, we mention that both baseline and MYTorus models report upper limits in the CT regime. A power-law-only model shows a more canonical slope value with Γ = 1.65 +0.19 −0.10 . Its border-line nature is likely due to the lack of low-energy data and its high-redshift, z=2.1, which makes the N H measure with NuSTAR-only data more uncertain. For the source 409, the BNTorus model is the only one reporting an estimated column density upper limit in the CT regime (the baseline model cannot constrain its value at all). although a little flat is still consistent at ∼ 1σ with the canonical value for an unabsorbed source. 9.2. Characterizing the major contributors of the residual missing CXB flux 9.2.1. On the heavily absorbed populations Thanks to the high sensitivity of NuSTAR at high energies we have investigated with our flux-limited sample the numerical predominance of the heavily absorbed AGN populations and the prominence in their spectrum the reflection components. Indeed these have been identified as the main actors in reproducing the residual unaccounted 20-30 keV CXB flux (Akylas et al. 2012). The limited sample size (63 sources) coupled with the large redshift range (z ≈ 0 − 1.5) do not allow to obtain stringent constraints. However we have obtained indicative estimates of these quantities from a more robust source-by-source broad-band (0.5-24 keV) modeling which is less prone to systematics and large statistical uncertainties 24 We have estimated an intrinsic fraction of AGN as a function of N H . Despite the low number of CT sources we were able to extract a fraction relative to the whole Compton Thin AGN population (i.e., log[N H /cm −2 ] = 20 − 24) which is formally in the range f 20−24 CT = 0.02 − 0.56 with an upper limit of f 20−24 CT < 0.66. There are many assumptions affecting this value and its uncertainty to different extents: (i) the small number statistics (function of the small sample size and of the relatively high unabsorbed flux at which the distribution of the AGN is unbiased), (ii) the assumption of the most representative absorption bias value in the CT bin (which strongly varies within this interval), (iii) the particular model used to infer the absorption bias (we explored the BNTorus model with two different choices of the opening angle) and (iv) an accurate spectral modeling for the CT sources in order to obtain accurate source counts needed to extrapolate at the limited flux the unbiased contribution of the source in the CT bin. Many of these aspects required assumptions to be made and we tried to make the most reasonable ones. This CT fraction is broadly representative for sources at redshift z ∼ 0.2 − 1.0 and luminosities log(L u,X /erg s −1 ) ≈ 43.4 − 44.6, the intervals being the 15.9% and 84.2% percentiles 25 ranges of the sub-sample of sources brighter than S intr smin (see Sect. 6) 24 Notice that in our 3-24 keV BNTorus joint spectral analysis for the log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23.5 − 24 sources, the logN H is derived with an accuracy a factor of 2 higher than that derived for sources selected at the same column densities and comparable fluxes in the soft X-ray studies by Lanzuisi et al. (2015) and Brightman et al. (2014). 25 The range delimited by these values corresponds to the inclusion of ∼ 68% of the sources assuming Gaussian distribution. and with constrained N H value. Given the large number of log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23 − 24 sources and the less pronounced bias in this bin, we obtain much better and stable constraints for these sources. Observational constraints for the local population tend to favour a larger fraction for these sources among the absorbed Compton Thin AGN for sources with comparable luminosity (Ricci et al. 2015). Comparable but stronger conclusions have been drawn by Liu et al. (2017) at higher redshifts (z = 1.6 − 2.4) for roughly similarly luminous sources (they includes less luminous, by a factor of ∼ 2, quasars). We cannot draw comparably strong conclusions on this point, we find indications for a more numerous population of log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23 − 24 compared to the log(N H /cm −2 ) = 22 − 23 one but within the uncertainties it is consistent with a constant value. Furthermore we are not able to test and disfavour models at a confidence level higher than 90%. As for the absorption fraction (f 22 ) for Compton Thin sources as a function of unabsorbed luminosity, our estimated fractions (computed in two bins) do not significantly imply a decreasing trend although they are in good agreement with those derived by much larger soft X-ray analysis on sources at similar redshifts (i.e. around or within z ≈ 0.1 − 1; U14, Buchner et al. 2015). A general increasing trend of f 22 with redshift has also been measured in deep X-ray spectroscopic investigations of the COSMOS and CDF-S fields (Buchner et al. 2015;Liu et al. 2017) and large complete samples (U14). It is reported in Fig. 14 for sources at log(L u,X /erg s −1 ) ≈ 43.5 − 44.62. We have estimated a fraction at z = 0.1 − 0.5 for sources of similar luminosity obtaining a generic agreement with extrapolations at lower redshift of the trend reported by Liu et al. (2017) and a good agreement with values estimated at z < 1 by U14 and Buchner et al. (2015). In order to better constrain and independently evaluate the luminosity and redshift dependence of f abs a much larger sample (at least twice the size of the present sample) and better quality data with good low energy X-ray coverage are necessary.


#### The importance of the reflection component

In our spectroscopic analysis we quantify also the reflection strength in each source. It is therefore interesting to compare our results to the typical assumptions made by in CXB population synthesis models. Indeed they generally implement relatively similar assumptions. The reflection is always assumed to have a constant value R ≈ 1 within each population (e.g. Ballantyne et al. 2006;Treister et al. 2009;Akylas et al. 2012;Ueda et al. 2014) or possibly a function of the degree of obscuration (e.g., G07; Ueda et al. 2014;Esposito & Walter 2016) with no dispersion around a mean value. On average we find median reflection val-ues which are: (1) significantly lower (R ≈ 0.3 − 0.7) than those assumed (R ≈ 1) by CXB models and (2) exhibit a rather broad distribution with a median value relative to the whole sample of ∼ 0.4 (Table 6). Furthermore we measure a significant anti-correlation with unabsorbed and intrinsic luminosities (the latter being more pronounced, see Fig. 8, lower panels and Table 6). This trend is further confirmed by the findings of our companion paper on stacked NuSTAR spectra (DM17). In this context we are finding sources with lower unabsorbed luminosities to have a median reflection ( R = 0.73) a factor of two stronger than more luminous ones ( R = 0.31). The broad R distribution reaches 50% percentile values a factor of two larger. When using intrinsic coronal luminosities the differences exhacerbates further by a factor of about two. A similar trend has been largely ignored by models the one exception being G07 model for which QSOs have been assumed to have no reflection. G07 assumes also higher R for Type-1 sources (R = 1.3) compared to Type-2s (R = 0.88) in order to mimick a orientation-dependent disk reflection. Ueda et al. (2014) instead assumes a flat R = 0.5 from the disk and a torus-based contribution in the context of a luminosity and redshift dependend unified scenario in order to reproduce a total R = 1 for Seyfert galaxies. Aird et al. (2015b) presenting the first direct measurements of the 10-40 keV XLF derived from the NuSTAR extragalactic survey program pointed out a degeneracy in the models parameters (the distribution of N H as a function of luminosity and z for the most obscured AGN and R) in order to reproduce the XLF. In particular they show that the high energy XLF can be alternatively modelled by either a distribution of N H derived by Aird et al. (2015a) (see Fig. 12) and a spectral model with a uniform distribution of reflection strength in the range 0 < R < 2 (i.e. R = 1) or a distribution of N H derived by Ueda et al. (2014) (Fig. 12) and a fixed R = 2 at all luminosities. Our analysis do not allow to conclusively break this degeneracy as the fraction of CT AGN is poorly constrained. Nonetheless the NuSTAR-derived R values as measured in this work and in DM17 firmly exclude the high and fixed values of R invoked in order to bring the Ueda et al. (2014) model into full consistency with the 10-40 keV XLF.

We find tentative evidence of an anticorrelation of R with N H , whereby more absorbed sources exhibit lower reflections. This is in qualitative in agreement with a disk reflection scenario although our median R values are smaller than those assumed by G07 (Table 6). This result however may also be indicative of a reflection component absorbed by the same medium obscuring the primary continuum in the hypothesis of no N Hdependence. With our small sample unfortunately we cannot test at high significance this hypothesis. Furthermore we mention that local studies find mildly obscured Seyferts to have stronger or equally strong reflections than unobscured counterparts (Ricci et al. 2011;Esposito & Walter 2016). We have insufficient statistic to infer such similar trend at comparable low luminosities (i.e. log[L u,X /erg s −1 ] < 44).


## CONCLUSIONS

We focused on a sample of 63 bright 8-24 keV-selected AGN with S(8 − 24) ≥ 7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 , from the multi-tiered NuSTAR Extragalactic Survey fields. The sample spans a redshift range of z = 0 − 2.1, with a median value z = 0.58. For the great majority of the sources (58) we performed spectral modeling in the broad 0.5-24 keV band by using archival lowenergy spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton. For five sources, selected from the Serendipitous fields, lowenergy data are not available. We used both empirically and physically motivated models, where the latter assumed Monte Carlo implementations of toroidal geometries. The results of the broad band spectral analysis can be summarised as follow:

• About 25% of the sample is comprised of heavily absorbed sources with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 23 (see Fig. 5).

• Depending on the details of the adopted modeling, the number of bona fide CT sources is 1-2 ( Fig. 10).

• For the empirically motivated model we computed unabsorbed 10-40 keV and intrinsic coronal 10-40 keV luminosities (i.e., removing the reflection contribution from the unabsorbed luminosities) and found that the former can lead to a luminosity-dependent overestimation of the latter which is highest, a factor ∼ 3 − 4, at the lowest luminosities (i.e., < 10 44 erg s −1 ; see Section 4.4 and Fig. 6).

• The median reflection strength of the sample is R =0.43, with a large scatter (interquartile range 0.06-1.50). We find that R significantly anticorrelates with unabsorbed 10-40 keV luminosity (in agreement with DM17) and intrinsic 10-40 keV AGN luminosity (see Table 6 and Fig. 8).

• The observed N H distribution for the absorbed (log[N H /cm −2 ] ≥ 22) sources is in agreement with CXB population-synthesis model predictions (see Fig. 10). The agreement persists when accounting for different spectral modelings or possibly misclassified AGN claimed as CT by previous soft Xray studies (Section 9.1.1).

• From the absorption-corrected number fraction we obtain a CT fraction broadly representative for z ≈ 0.2 − 1.0 and log(L u,X /erg s −1 ) ≈ 43.4 − 44.6 AGN. The estimated fraction, relative to the AGN population at log(N H /cm −2 ) < 24, is f 20−24 CT = 0.02 − 0.56 (<0.66 at 90% c.l.). This value drops by a factor of ∼1.7 if we assume a toroidal obscurer with a halved opening angle (Fig. 12).

• We estimated the intrinsic fraction of obscured Compton Thin (log[N H /cm −2 ] ≥ 22) sources as a function of unabsorbed luminosity at 10-40 keV (Fig. 13). The derived fractions cannot constrain a trend with luminosity however they are in good agreement with results reported by other authors at similar epochs (i.e. z < ∼ 1.0). We further calculate the absorption fraction for sources at z = 0.1−0.5 and with log(L u,X /erg s −1 ) ≈ 43.6−44.3. The resulting f 22 = 0.36±0.18 agrees with extrapolated decreasing trends (from high to low z) from surveys covering the same luminosity range and higher redshifts (z ≈ 3) and with reported values at similar redshift range.

Clearly increasing the number of sources to spectroscopically study at these flux levels and with good quality low-energy data would help to better characterize the NuSTAR hard-band selected AGN population at moderate redshift (z ≈ 0.5 − 1). This will help in further elucidating the hinted correlation between reflection strength and column density and start a robust investigation of possible redshift dependence of the absorbed fractions.

The main benefit of enlarging the sample size will be the increase in the number of robust CT sources identified at redshifts and luminosities poorly probed currently. This will allow: 1) a more robust and constrained estimate of the CT fraction; 2) the discrimination of CXB population synthesis models through the comparison of more accurate source counts in the log(N H /cm −2 ) = 24 − 25 range of column densities; 3) to start probing the log(N H /cm −2 ) = 25 − 26 bin which is precluded in our analysis due to a combination of strong absorption bias and small number statistics. The Serendipitous Survey will progressively increase its sky coverage, providing crucial help in this regard, especially if backed-up by ancillary spectroscopic low-energy X-ray and optical data. Three (likely four) CT AGN have already been found in the 13 deg 2 area probed by the first 40-month Serendipitous Survey sample in Lansbury et al. (2017a). This number has to be regarded as lower limit given the 70% redshift completeness and the hardness ratio approach used to find extreme heavily obscured candidates.

To make significant progresses in this field, an X-ray observatory with more than one order of magnitude larger collecting area, sub-arcmin PSF and higher energy coverage such as the High-Energy X-ray Probe 26 , is required. It will allow to: (1) resolve the great majority (∼ 80 − 90%) of the CXB at its spectral energy density peak, (2) break the degeneracy between high energy spectral features and the abundance of CT sources and (3) perform detailed studies on the CT source population. Despite the modest technology development required which is based on the NuSTAR heritage, such instrument is not currently planned for the next decade. Figure A1. Broad-band spectra and relative best-fit model for sources egs26, ser37 and ser148. The adopted best-fit model is the baseline one modified with the addition of low-energy ionized/neutral partial covering absorber. Black, red, green and blue spectra refer to Chandra , XMM-Newton, NuSTAR-FPMA and NuSTAR-FPMB, respectively. 442.9/431 with Γ = 2.37, log(N H /cm −2 ) ≤ 21.3 and R ≈ 67. The reflection parameter value is extremely high and unphysical. We therefore tried to add a dual-absorber modeling (e.g., Cappi et al. 1996;Dong et al. 2004) to the primary power-law, i.e., a further absorption component given by an inhomogenous cold medium at larger scales by employing the model zpcfabs. With this parametrization, we obtained an even better fit (W stat/dof = 424.4/429) with more reasonable parameters (as reported in Table 5): Γ = 1.56, log(N H /cm −2 ) ≤ 21.1 and R < 0.18. For the second absorber we find log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23.40 +0.05 −0.02 and a covering fraction f c = 0.73 ± 0.03. Spectra and best-fit model are reported in Fig. A1.


## A.4. Serendip

• ser243: This source has Γ flatter than the canonical value at high significance (see Table 5). It also seems to require a scattered component (in Chandra data at energies below 0.5 keV) with Γ sc ≃ 2.4. Freezing the primary photon index to the canonical Γ = 1.8 makes the scattered component steeper, Γ sc ≃ 3. In this case the reflection strength raises from R < 0.74 to R = 1.1.

• ser318: The XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data are simultaneous, though the spectra do not to agree well at 3-4 keV: XMM-Newton has a factor of 7-8 fewer counts in this range. NuSTAR shows a hint of Fe Kα at ∼ 3 keV.

• ser37: The spectrum of this source is very flat and unabsorbed. A fit with an absorbed power-law returns Γ = 0.2 and negligible column density. However the modeling is not acceptable, with strong residuals across the broad-band and fit statistics of W stat/dof = 345.04/218. The baseline modeling yields a much better parametrization with W stat/dof = 225.77/217. The best-fit parameters are Γ ≈ 2.5, log(N H /cm −2 ) ≤ 19.9 and R = 10.3. Both Γ and R are too high. Therefore, as done with egs26, we tried a dual absorber model modifying the primary power-law with cold and partially ionized partial covering absorbers (zpcfabs and zxipcf, respectively). The model which gives the better parametrization in terms of fit statistics and reasonable parameters (see Table 5) is obtained using the warm ionized absorption model and imposing Γ = 1.8. For the absorber we obtained the following parameters: log(N H /cm −2 ) = 22.80 +0.02 −0.03 , f c = 0.969 +0.003 −0.006 and a ionization parameter log(ξ/erg cm s −1 ) = −0.55 +0.10 −0.19 . Spectra and best-fit model are reported in Fig. A1.

• ser267: In our spectral analysis we treated this AGN as a canonical unabsorbed source. The joint Chandra and NuSTAR FPMA+FPMB low quality spectra (i.e., 45, 27 and 38 total net-counts, respectively) are jointly modelled with an unabsorbed baseline model with primary continuum slope consistent with the canonical Γ =1.8-2 value. On the other hand, in the NuSTAR spectra (i.e., in both focal plane modules) we find evidence of a strong residual at an energy of ∼ 5.7 keV (10 net-counts in both focal plane modules). The significance of this feature if modelled with a Gaussian line is at the ∼ 2σ level (based on ∆χ 2 confidence contours on line energy and normalization). The line can be modelled by a 6.4 keV Fe Kα at the redshift z = 0.131 of the source. In our best-fit baseline parametrization the line has an observed EW ≈ 1.4 keV. The low quality Chandra spectrum is consistent with this best-fit line solution. This may be an indication that the source hosts an obscured AGN. We mention however that the optical spectrum from SDSS shows broad lines pointing to a Type 1 classification for this source. Clearly better X-ray data across the broad 0.5-24 keV band are needed to shed light on the nature of this source and properly assess the significance of the line as Fe Kα.

• ser148: A simple power-law model shows a flat spectrum with Γ = 1.4 with strong residuals at low energies (W stat/dof = 3143.79/1261). A simple cold absorption is not required. The baseline model does not improve the modeling. Reflection is not required as the large residuals are at soft energies (< 1 − 2 keV). We therefore further tried additional warm absorption (zxipcf) on the primary component and obtained a good representation of the spectrum (see Table 5) with the following warm absorber parameters: log(N H /cm −2 ) = 22.76 ± 0.01, f c = 1.0 and a ionization parameter log(ξ/erg cm s −1 ) = 1.39 ± 0.05. Spectra and best-fit model are reported in Fig. A1.

• ser261: No observations at low energy are available for this sources from either Chandra or XMM-Newton. There are short observations (< 10ks) from Swift-XRT in which a source is barely detected 10 − 20 arcsec from the NuSTAR position. If this is the right low-energy counterpart it is difficult to model the joint Swift-XRT-NuSTAR spectrum. It results in a heavily absorbed source (from NuSTAR data) with a large scattered component (from Swift). We mention that the SDSS spectrum of the optical counterpart shows evidence of broad emission lines.

The binning is 0.5 dex.R and logN H with ρ = −0.25 and a null hypothesis probability that the two quantities are not related to each other of p =0.05. The median R values for unobscured and obscured samples are respectively of 0.67 and 0.28. Despite the apparent difference, their IQR have in common a quite large interval of values. The difference in the lower values (with unabsorbed sources having larger values) may reflect the fact that the obscured sample has twice as many upper limits as the unobscured sample. We verified that the presence of such a large number of upper limits does not depend on the SNR of the NuSTAR spectra. The upper bounds of the interquartile range differ by a factor of ∼ 1.7. Both categories sample AGN with similar range in luminosities (interquartile range log(L u,X /erg s −1 ) = 43.8 − 44.9 and log(L i,X /erg s −1 ) = 43.5 − 44.6)

Red dots report values from the MYTorus model. are MYTorus (Murphy & Yaqoob 2009) and the Brightman & Nandra (2011) model (hereafter BN-Torus).

## Figure 11 .
11Upper panel: absorption bias in the 8-24 keV band assuming a BNTorus model with Γ = 1.8 for different redshifts as indicated. Black and light grey are for respectively θoa = 60 deg and 30 deg (BNTorus30 case). Lower panel: ratio between the 8-24 keV absorption bias between 60 deg and 30 deg.


Fig. 11) and fixing 18 S intr min = 10 −13 erg s −1 cm −2 . We obtain a fraction of CT sources f 20−24 CT = 0.02 − 0.56 (0.01-0.33 for BNTorus30). The 90% upper-limit is f 20−24 CT < 0.66 and is reported in figure as dotted line. Assuming N H derived from baseline model only we obtain f 20−24 CT = 0.08 − 0.66.

## Figure 13 .
13Intrinsic absorbed fractions for Compton Thin sources with log(NH/cm −2 ) > 22 as a function of unabsorbed 10-40 keV luminosity. The relative median redshift from the objects contributing to each bin is highlighted with a bluerlarger dot representing local lower luminosity sources and redder-smaller ones showing farther more luminous objects. Green data are fractions reported byUeda et al. (2014) for z = 0.1 − 1 sources. Hatched orange region is the region determined byBuchner et al. (2015) for z = 0.5 − 0.75 AGN. Short and long dashed lines represent the G07 andAkylas et al. (2012) CXB synthesis model predictions, as indicated. Grey shaded regions relative to our two data points give an indication of the robustness of the absorbed fraction (see Section 7.1 for details).

## Figure 15 .
15Upper panel: best-fit power-law slopes to the logN-logS produced in 0.1 dex logNH steps within 1 dex logNH bins. The slope and the relative uncertainty (shaded grey region) are the median value of the distribution of the best-fit α from 1000 realizations of the sample obtained by randomizing logNH according to their errors and upper limits. Dotted and dashed lines are the best-fit value fo the logN-logS of the whole sample and the Euclidean value. Middle panel: is the median redshift and relative interquartile range (shaded grey region) values obtained from the 1000 random realizations of the sample. Dotted line represents the median redshift value. Lower panel: mean value of the number of the sources considered with relative dispersion (shaded grey region) obtained from the random realizations.


Fig. 16reports logN -logS for unobscured (log[N H /cm −2 ] < 22), mildly obscured (log[N H /cm −2 ] = 22 − 23), heavily obscured (log[N H /cm −2 ] = 23 − 24) and CT sources

## Figure 16 .

A simple power-law model returns Γ = 1.21 +0.53 −0.27 , which 23 They both used an edge-on BNTorus model. Lanzuisi et al. (2015) adopted Γ = 1.9 with a scattered power-law component with same photon index. Brightman et al. (2014) adopted Γ = 1.7 and torus semi-opening angle of 30 • with negligible scattered component.

The fluxes reported in C15 are from 20 ′′ apertures. They have been estrapolated to 30 ′′ aperture fluxes by assuming a 1.47 constant conversion factor. This factor is obtained as ratio between the fluxes in 30 ′′ and 20 ′′ apertures measured from the on-axis NuSTAR point-spread function.

For the 58 sources with low-energy spectral data, the difference between the estimated best-fit constants is reasonably low being smaller than a factor of ∼ 2 for the majority of the sources (50). Four sources (cosmos129, cosmos229, cosmos297 and ser77) show variations larger than a factor of 2-3 in both XMM-Newton and NuSTAR clearly pointing to source variability as main cause of discrepancy. The remaining four sources cosmos249, cosmos263, ser148 and ecdfs5 have variations by factors 2-4 with the latter showing the largest variation which is possibly due to contamination from a nearby source (see Appendix for details).
We assumed a symmetric distribution centered on the parameter value with 1σ standard deviation as the mean of the lower and upper error-bars.
This could be due to the tendency of BNTorus to overestimate the low-energy reflection component for edge-on orientations as pointed out byLiu & Li (2015). This would require a lower column density to explain the observed absorption cut-off.
We verified that our adopted median values are stable and not very sensitive to these outliers.
The fraction of the CT sources (relative to all AGN population) obtained with the best-fit slopes is rather high and uncertain given its large uncertainties; seeTable 8.18  The absorption bias in this case is smaller by a factor of about two compared to the adopted θoa = 60 deg, seeFig. 11lower panel, however given the uncertainties in estimating the exact value of S intr min due to the low number of sources, we prefer to assume the same value derived for the 60 deg case.
We calculate this range as the interval in redshift for the sources contributing at 90% of the total space densities.
They evaluated their completeness down to a certain column density by assuming a power-law with Γ = 1.8 modified by photoelectric absorption with and empirically self-absorbed (log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23) reflection component parametrized by pexrav with R = 0.5 and Ec = 300 keV and a scattered fraction set to 1.7% of the primary continuum level.22  We used equations 5 and 6 inCappelluti et al. (2007) for estimating cumulative number counts and relative uncertainties.

The evaluation of possible contribution to our spectra from additional flux from sources located within the spectral extraction radii is performed using the source information provided by the COSMOS-Legacy catalog.

We did not try joint broad-band models with the NuSTAR data (except for the CT source cosmos330) through complicated models but rather used a flux estimate at low energy with a simple absorbed power-law model to evaluate possible contamination in common energy bands. • cosmos107: The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two sources of similar flux in the COSMOS-Legacy field: lid1689, lid1688.

It has an Fe Kα line at the optical spectroscopic redshift. The hard-band NuSTAR flux for cosmos107 from the baseline model gives a flux of 9 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 .

The latter is at the edge of the NuSTAR extraction radius and its spectrum has 30 net-counts (0.5-8 keV) and is consistent with being unabsorbed. The XMM-Newton extraction radius does not include this source. Hence only the NuSTAR spectrum is potentially affected by cid818. However, at 5-7 keV cid818 flux is one to two orders of magnitudes fainter than cid284. • Cosmos129, The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two Chandra sources: cid284 (the low energy counterpart) and cid818. so we can safely assume that the NuSTAR measurement is not significantly affected by cid818• cosmos129: The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two Chandra sources: cid284 (the low energy counterpart) and cid818.

The scattered components in Chandra and XMM-Newton seem to have different shapes (Γ) and normalizations, suggestive of source variability. The source is close (several arcsec) to another AGN (cid366). • Cosmos154, • cosmos154: The scattered components in Chandra and XMM-Newton seem to have different shapes (Γ) and normalizations, suggestive of source variability.

Moreover Chandra seems to exhibit diffuse emission around the source which is probably partially included in XMM-Newton. We have decided to exclude the XMM-Newton data and use only Chandra (which has the highest statistics). Chandra does not include the latter source while XMM-Newton partially does (it is heavily blended). NuSTARwill include both CID366 emission and thermal diffuse emission. However they are relevant only at energies lower than 3-4 keV. The cid366 spectrum level at 3 keV is comparable. with cosmos154 while at 4 keV there is a factor ∼ 10 difference.

Three of them dominate in terms of counts: cid168 (the low-energy counterpart), cid190, cid192. The 0.5-8 keV (3-8 keV) flux of the first one, i.e., the low-energy counterpart, is 5.1 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 (2.7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 ). The other two have lower fluxes, 1.7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 (9.5 × 10 −15 erg s −1 cm −2 ) and 2.2 × 10 −14. • Cosmos178, The NuSTAR extraction radius includes five sources. erg s −1 cm −2 (6.8 × 10 −15 erg s −1 cm −2• cosmos178: The NuSTAR extraction radius includes five sources.

The fluxes are comparable within a factor of 3. Therefore the NuSTAR spectrum includes flux from all the three sources. The 8-24 keV flux of this source is ∼ 7 × 10 −14 erg s −1 cm −2 , implying that the cid168 flux is very likely fainter. The XMM-Newton spectrum includes only the cid168 source.

Out of these, two are very faint and the other two dominate the total number of counts. These are: cid482 (the low-energy counterpart) and cid484. Below 4-5 keV both sources have comparable Chandra fluxes although cid482 is a factor of few higher in flux. • Cosmos181, The NuSTAR extraction radius includes four sources. the contribution at 4-5 keV of cid484 is not negligible.

The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two sources, cid329 (the low-energy counterpart) and cid328. The latter is more than one order of magnitude fainter at all energies. Therefore it should not significantly affect our modelings. • Cosmos206, • cosmos206: The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two sources, cid329 (the low-energy counterpart) and cid328. The latter is more than one order of magnitude fainter at all energies. Therefore it should not significantly affect our modelings.

The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two sources separated by 33 arcsec: lid1645 (the low-energy counterpart) and lid1644. The counterpart has a factor of ∼ 5 more counts than lid1644 in the 3-8 keV Chandra spectral range. Therefore the NuSTAR spectra should not be substantially contaminated by the latter source. • Cosmos207, • cosmos207: The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two sources separated by 33 arcsec: lid1645 (the low-energy counterpart) and lid1644.

In the Chandra data, cid420 has a 3-8 keV flux which is 1.2 − 4 (1σ range) times higher than cid1120. Therefore it is likely that at least the soft NuSTAR band is contaminated to some extent by the fainter source. • Cosmos229, The small NuSTAR extraction radius (25 arcsec) includes two sources separated by 26 arcsec: cid420 (the low-energy counterpart, offset 14 arcsec from the NuSTAR position of cosmos229) and cid 1120. Because of this the source would potentially be dropped from the sample since its hard-band NuSTAR flux would potentially fall below threshold• cosmos229: The small NuSTAR extraction radius (25 arcsec) includes two sources separated by 26 arcsec: cid420 (the low-energy counterpart, offset 14 arcsec from the NuSTAR position of cosmos229) and cid 1120.

The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two sources separated by 26 arcsec: lid1791 (the identified low-energy counterpart) and lid1792. In the 3-8 keV band the counterpart is a factor ∼ 2 − 2.5 (a factor of ∼ 2 in the Chandra collected net counts) brighter than the latter contaminant source. We fit the cosmos330 spectra jointly with the Chandra spectrum of lid1792 to account for its contamination and recover the intrinsic spectral parameters for lid1791. • Cosmos330, We find that the spectral parameters of cosmos330 do not appreciably vary and that the source is still classified as CT• cosmos330: The NuSTAR extraction radius includes two sources separated by 26 arcsec: lid1791 (the identified low-energy counterpart) and lid1792.

This source does not have unique counterparts in M15. There is one at low redshift (z = 0.141; Chandra ID 103) and one at high-redshift. • Ecdfs5, z = 1.957• ecdfs5: This source does not have unique counterparts in M15.

We therefore tried a joint modeling of these two sources with the NuSTAR data. Both sources are unabsorbed with Γ ≈ 2.1. The NuSTAR spectra in the common 3-8 keV band have normalizations which are higher than the Chandra spectra by factors of ∼ 2 and ∼ 5.4 for ID 103 and ID 100, respectively. In the 8-24 keV band.

The spectrum of this source is flat and unabsorbed. A fit with an absorbed power-law returns a bestfit Γ = 0.9 with negligible column density for which we place an upper limit at log(N H /cm −2 ) ≤ 20.3 with W stat/dof = 472.31/433.
