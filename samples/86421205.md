Diabetic retinopathy is the most common complication caused by the diabetes, which affects the eyes and results in blindness. It's due to damage of the arteries and veins located in the fundus of the eye (retina) that are composed of light sensitive tissues. Although DR can be prevalent now days, its prevention remains challenging. Ophthalmologists typically diagnose the presence and severity of DR through visual assessment of the funds by direct examination and by evaluation of colour photographs. There are a large number of diabetes patients globally, this process is expensive as well as time consuming. The automated DR system is developed to predict various related diseases that are analysed. The Digital Retinal Fundus image is analysed for the classification of various stages of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).

Diabetic Retinopathy DR Tool will enable doctors to view variations from multiple fundus camera images with the help of image preprocessing techniques. The tool makes use of the emerging machine learning technology to process fundus images quickly and accurately as manual screening. Most important, it reduces the time period for executing the complete process.


## IV. DIABETIC RETINOPATHY DETECTION TECHNIQUES

A. Retinal Image Analysis Using Machine Learning Algorithm. 1) "Santhakumar R", et.al [1] introduces the design and implementation of screening and diagnostic tool for Diabetic Retinopathy was successfully completed. The screening tool has two segments; Image level and patch level prediction. The feature plot using PCA provides visualization of parameter value for the different classes. The different textural features are Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Histogram of Gradient (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). The patch level prediction using multi class Support Vector Machine is also efficiently implemented for prediction of Hard Exudates and Hemorrhage. a) Advantage: The different textural features like Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Histogram of Gradient (HOG) and

Local Binary Pattern (LBP) are implemented. The PCA is used to visualize the features and Windowing method is used for detecting Hard Exudates.

2) "Sohini Roychowdhury", et al [10] discuss about the Classifiers such as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Ada Boost are analyzed for classifying retinopathy lesions from non -lesions. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and KNN classifiers are found to be the best classifiers for bright and red lesion classification, respectively. A novel two-step hierarchical classification approach is proposed where the non-lesions or false positives are rejected in the first step. In the second step, the bright lesions are classified as hard exudates and cotton wool spots, and the red lesions are classified as hemorrhages and micro-aneurysms.  2) "Xiyang Liu", et al [4] focuses on computer vision-based framework for the automatic localization and diagnosis of slit lamp images by identifying the lens region of interest (ROI) and employing a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). The performance and effectiveness of the deep features extracted in the CNN, the ROI of the lens was identified with the adoption of twice-applied Candy detection and Hough transform and then it entered into the CNN to investigate the slit-lamp image. a) Advantage: Deployment of multi kernel learning and ensemble learning for slit-lamp images.

C. Features Extracted From Fundus Images Using Svm (Support Vector Machine) 1) "R. Adalarasan", et al [3] describes the extraction of normal and isolated characteristics or marks in color retinal images. The adaptive filters are tuned to match the lump (part) of vessel to be extracted in green channel images. The soft exudates color and intensity were close to fundus color. The lesions breed of interest was micro aneurysms, haemorrhages, hard exudates, soft exudates and neovascularization. The precision of exudates perception appears to be good since exudate pixels were accurately classified as exudates and further pixels as non-exudates by Biogeography Based Optimization Algorithm. a) Advantage: Color based approach for identifying hemorrhages, hard exudates, and soft exudates.  The EWT technique is used to decompose the image and correntropy features are obtained from decomposed EWT components. ii)

EWT is less costly as compare to other techniques like HRT, SLP and so on. 3) "Ramon Pires", et al [9] focuses bypass lesion detection, and directly train a classifier for DR referral. Novelties are the use of state-of-the-art mid-level features for the retinal images: BossaNova and Fisher Vector. These features extend the classical Bags of Visual Words and greatly improve the accuracy of complex classification tasks. The highlight that directs assessment is new for referable diabetic retinopathy, and has not been developed before. a) Advantage: Much simpler to implement, test, and deploy. D. Computer Aided Diagnosis System For Diabetic Retinopathy 1) "Romany F. Mansour" [8] survey revealed that evolutionary computing methods can play vital role for optimizing DR-CAD functional components, such as pro-processing by enhancing filters coefficient, segmentation by enriching clustering, feature extraction, feature selection, and dimensional reduction, as well as classification. Robust and efficient computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system to enable earlier DR detection and optimal diagnosis decision. The prime objective of these CAD solutions is to identify DR features earlier and identify severity of the DR. To enhance these approaches a number of evolutionary computing algorithms such as GA, PSO, ACO, BFO, DE etc have been applied which primarily functions towards enhancing functional extraction parameters and feature selection. PSO being a stochastic heuristics optimization method takes extracted features from the RR correlation analysis and employs swarm intelligence approach to identify optimal solution by estimating global minima. PSO avoid crossover and mutation processes and thus avoid significant computational overhead.


## a) Advantages i) Number of technologies developed for diabetic retinopathy (DR) have been studied and respective strength as well as weaknesses has been assessed. ii)

PSO algorithm that significantly reduced time complexity.

2) "Mike Voets", et al [7] Replication studies are essential for validation of new methods, and to Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs. The deep learning can be used to automatically detect diabetic retinopathy. They re-implemented the method since the source code is not available, and used publicly available data sets. The Kaggle Eye PACS test dataset is used for this work.  Realizing the robustness of deep neural network (DNN) algorithm.

The EC schemes can be significant for feature selection.

VI. ADVANTAGES A. Early detection of DR can help allow people to retain their sight and enable specialists to focus on treatments. B. Relatively lower cost than manual methods. C. Highly scalable process with quick response time.


## VII. APPLICATIONS


## A.

To detect the DR (Diabetic Retinopathy) stages.


## VIII. CONCLUSION

This paper surveys and analyzes the automatic DR detection and diagnosis applied to human retinal fundus images as input and processes it to identify abnormalities based on aforementioned DR features and assess its severity. Here number of technologies developed for diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been studied. This survey revealed that a significant amount of efforts have been made on enhancing the image quality by optimizing image contrast and background illumination over green channel fundus images. Thus, observing overall literatures and respective contributions, it can be visualized that evolutionary computing schemes can be of significance to strengthen all the comprising functional components of the diabetic retinopathy, including pro-processing by enhancing filters coefficient, segmentation by enriching clustering or ROI feature selection, feature extraction, feature selection, and dimensional reduction, and classification enhancement by facilitating optimal learning weight parameters regularization parameters (for SVM) etc.

:Color based approach.[3] 2) "Shishir Maheshwari", et al[6] introduces an automated diagnosisof glaucoma system. The available scanning methods are Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT), Scanning Laser Polarimetry (SLP) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). These methods are expensive and require experienced clinicians to use them. Present a new methodology for an automated diagnosis of glaucoma using digital fundus images based on Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT). The EWT is used to decompose the image and correntropy features are obtained from decomposed EWT components. These extracted features are ranked based on t value feature selection algorithm. Extracted features are used for the classification of normal and glaucoma images using Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier. a) Advantages i)


The detection of neovascularization and vascular beading caused by proliferative DR, and druse caused by macular degeneration. a) Advantage: The reduction in the number of features used for lesion classification by feature ranking using Adaboost where 30 top features are selected out of 78.B. Neural Network for Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy. 
1) "B. Sumathy" et al [2] describes the abnormal features in the fundus images with the performance approaching that of trained 
clinical observer. A novel combination of image preprocessing technique for retinal anatomical structures and classification 
with machine learning is a computer based which extracts abnormal features such as micro aneurysms, exudates, hemorrhages 
and new vessels etc. for grading the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy. It found to reduce the manual effort required for the 
detection and also the accuracy gets increased. Computationally powerful to detect and diagnose the diseases from the fundus 
images. 
a) Advantage: The first phase is preprocessing steps are done followed by next phase of removal of normal features with 
extraction of abnormal features and its statistical values. The third phase is classification stages which includes mild, moderate 
to severe, severe PDR and neovascularization etc. using neural network.
