23 Familial concordance of nutritional status is an emerging field of study that may guide the 24 development of interventions that operate beyond the individual and within the family 25 context. Little published data exist for concordance of nutritional status within Pakistani 26 households. We assessed the associations between weight status of mothers and their 27 children in a nationally representative sample of households in Pakistan using 28 Demographic and Health Survey data. Our analysis included 3465 mother-child dyads, 29 restricting to children under-five years of age with body mass index (BMI) information on 30 their mothers. We used linear regression models to assess the associations between 31 maternal BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) and child's 32 weight-for-height z-score (WHZ), accounting for socio-demographic characteristics of 33 mothers and children. We assessed these relationships in all children under-five and also 34 stratified by age of children (younger than 2 years and 2 to 5 years). In all children under-35 five and in children 2 to 5 years, maternal BMI was positively associated with child's WHZ, 36 while there was no association between maternal BMI and child WHZ for children under-37 two. The findings indicate that the weight status of mother's is positively associated with 38 that of their children. These associations have implications for interventions aimed at 39 healthy weights of families. 40 41 .CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 5, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.04.23289509 doi: medRxiv preprint 42 Introduction 43 There is a growing body of literature focusing on concordance of cardiometabolic 44 disease risk factors and outcomes within families and households, suggesting that NCD 45 prevention programs may be more effective if the family -rather than the individual -was 46 targeted for intervention. Studies show increased likelihood of adults living with someone 47 with a chronic condition, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and 48 other cardiometabolic conditions, having that same condition. This includes concordance 49 between parent-child [1,2], sibling [3,4], spousal dyads [5], and between any co-residing 50 members of households [6,7]. These studies investigate the genetic predisposition to 51 disease [6], as can be seen in strictly familial relationships, and also the effect of the 52 shared environment [8] and health behavior influences [9,10], such as in co-residing 53 studies. 54 Intergenerational concordance within households -and specifically that between 55 parents and children -may reflect a composite of genetic, epigenetic, and shared 56 environmental factors. The magnitude of intergenerational concordance of NCD risk 57 within households in Pakistan is largely unknown. Studies focusing on parent-child 58 concordance have been primarily done in high-income countries, such as in the United 59 Kingdom and Australia [11-16]. There is some evidence from low-and middle-income 60 countries (LMICs) regarding concordance of biomarkers such as hemoglobin A1c and C-61 reactive protein [2]. Specifically in South Asia, studies show statistically significant 62 associations between child under-five obesity and maternal weight, but do not further 63 stratify these relationships by child age [17,18]..

Pakistan 65 has one of the highest average household sizes and percentage of multigenerational 66 households in the world, suggesting extended sharing of environment between 67 generations. Moreover, Pakistan is following a global trend of increasing life expectancy, 68 signaling a large population of individuals at higher risk of developing NCDs that the 69 Pakistani healthcare system will have to manage in the future [19]. Additionally, children 70 in Pakistan are becoming increasingly vulnerable to different forms of malnutrition: in the 71 2018 Pakistan National Nutrition Survey (PNNS), wasting was noted in 17.7% of children, 72 the highest in Pakistan's history, and prevalence of overweight children under-five almost 73 doubled from 5% in 2011 to 9.5% in 2018. Similarly, women ages 15-49 experienced an 74 increase in overweight and obesity increasing from 28% to 37.8% from 2011 to 2018 [20]. 75 This parallel increase in excess weight across a wide range of Pakistani age 76 demographics may have important implications for cardiometabolic disease at the 77 population level. Thus, there is a need to study Pakistani household concordance of NCD 78 risk factors to further understand the extent, if present, of household concordance in 79 Pakistan, especially with an additional focus on parent-child concordance to advocate for 80 interventions that involve the full household, and not only prevention for adults.81In the present study, we analyzed the concordance of maternal and child weight 82 status, a critical risk factor for NCDs. We further investigate the dynamics of these 83 associations across different age groups of children under 5..

PDHS-7 was the 7 th 90 round of a nationally representative survey, with information about household, 91 demographic, and maternal and child health indicators. The survey design and sample 92 size calculations were formulated to provide reliable information at the national level and 93 subnational levels, as well as for urban and rural areas separately, with data collected 94 from the four provinces of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan, the 95 regions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, the Islamabad Capital 96 Territory, and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The sampling design used a 97 two-stage stratified approach and, because of non-proportional sample allocation, the 98 sample weights were generated by the PDHS team. Participants were recruited and 99 data was collected from November 2017 to April 2018 100 The respondents included all ever-married women aged 15-49 in all selected 101 households. In one-third of the selected households, height and weight were directly 102 measured for ever-married women 15-49 and children under-five years of age. For this 103 study, we included all children under-five who had WHZ information and BMI 104 information on their mothers, leading to a sampling-weight adjusted sample size of 105 3465. Fig 1 depicts the sampling scheme and relevant response rates for PDHS-7 [21].

The study was reviewed and approved by the National Bioethics Committee of 107 the Pakistan Health Research Council and the Inner City Fund/ ICF Institutional Review 108 Board. Adult participants were consented both, for themselves and for their children 109 [21]. Prior to obtaining access to and performing analysis on the PDHS-7 data, the 110 researchers of the present study submitted a concept note, gained data access, and 111 obtained permission from USAID. The data were de-identified and anonymized by the 112 DHS program prior to being shared, therefore not considered human subjects research 113 by an author-affiliated institution (Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA) and not requiring 114 further ethical clearance.


# Study Measures

116 117 Child weight status: Weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) 118 Child weight and height measurements were taken during a single visit. Weight 119 measurements were taken using SECA scales (model no. SECA 878U) and height 120 measurements using a Shorr Board (recumbent if child's age was less than 24 months 121 and standing if older). Anthropometry data in PDHS-7 was collected by two female 122 enumerators in each field team (total of 44 enumerators) who jointly took 123 measurements. All enumerators were trained beforehand to standardize procedures for 124 anthropometry, including hands-on training to measure ten children twice to assess 125 accuracy and precision of measurements and further training for those enumerators 126 who were out of range more three or more times [21].

Overall, this may indicate an avenue for early interventions 343 for weight-related risks in children, where healthier nutritional sources during infancy may 344 lead to a decreased sharing of NCD risk found between very young children and their 345 mothers as children age.

Considering strengths of this study, the analysis was done on a nationally 352 representative dataset which involved a complex sampling process to obtain the best 353 possible demographic snapshot of Pakistan. The analysis also included a significant 354 number of covariates to unveil potential confounders and used rigid levels of correction 355 and validation regarding significance and multi-collinearity. Limitations of the study 356 included the use of cross-sectional data, whereas a cohort study could provide more in-357 depth data on trends in specific households.


## 358

Overall, the findings of maternal-child concordance and, more specifically, the 359 'masking' phenomenon could have important implications regarding interventions and 360 policy making, where these seemingly non-concordant groups may be ignored as an 361 avenue to improve NCD risk unless there is data suggesting that the concordance may 362 'unmask' later. Future work should involve more detailed data collection of 363 cardiometabolic disease and, more broadly, NCD risk concordance and outcome .

180 intervals. Other reported adjusted population descriptive statistics were percentage of 181 dyads that were urban vs rural, percentage of male and female children, percentage of 182 mothers currently employed, percentage of children being the youngest child, 183 percentage of children being the oldest under-five, and the percentage of the sample 184 size in each wealth index quintile. The mean child WHZ with 95% confidence interval 185 and sampling weight-adjusted sample size was also reported for each factor level. 186 Modeling associations between maternal and child weight status 187 188 We estimated linear regression models to investigate concordance between 189 maternal BMI and child WHZ, measured continuously. Three linear models were 190 generated: 1) all children under-five years, 2) all children under-two years, 3) all children 191 ages 2 to 5, with the models adjusted for the 8 covariates. We reported the R 2 value and 192 the Wald F for each model and reported the parameter estimates with 95% confidence 193 interval and t-test value for each categorical level. For each model, the statistically 194 significant variables were remodeled including only these variables and an additional 195 term for each two-variable combination to assess for interaction between the statistically 196 significant variables. Cases with missing values for any variables were treated as 197 invalid. Associations for all models were considered statistically significant when p < 198 0.05.


mean child WHZ was in children who belonged to the richest quintile of 228 households at 0.04 (95% CI [-0.09, 0.17]), and the category with the lowest mean child 229 WHZ was children with mothers who were underweight at -0.66 (95% CI [-0.80, -0.51]).

## 287
Overall variable p-values in parenthesis denote statistically significant associations (Holm-Bonferroni 288 corrected) 289 * denotes reference category 290 Discussion and Conclusion291   We found that maternal BMI was positively associated with child WHZ in children 292 under 5. This positive association was present for children ages 2 to 5, even after 293 accounting for several socio-demographic factors, but not for children under-two. The 294 findings suggest that there is intergenerational concordance in weight status in Pakistani 295 mothers and young children which is unmasked with increased age.


findings of parent-child concordance of BMI-WHZ for all children under-five 297 are consistent with previous literature which specifically explore parent-child concordance 298 of NCD risk [2,11-16] and of association studies in South Asia which have observed a 299 positive association between maternal and children under-five weight status [17,18].300 However, previously described phenomenon of the double burden of malnutrition at 301 household level (DBMHL) suggests co-existence of undernourished children and 302 overweight mothers in the same household, but this phenomenon is primarily described 303 for child stunting and, in some cases, underweight [43-51]. Although a recent study by 304 Biswas et al., in which they analyzed the co-existence of overweight mothers with all types 305 of undernourished children under-five (stunted, wasted, and underweight) in South and 306 Southeast Asia from 2006 to 2017 data, described positive relationships between 307 maternal weight status and all three types of child undernutrition, with the greatest co-308 existence in Pakistan. However, this study did not analyze the relationship between non-309 overweight or obese mothers and their children, nor did it split the children under-five into 310 two age groups [52]. 311 Furthermore, double burden of malnutrition (DBM) at the country or population 312 level is well-established in previous literature [53-56]. DBM prevalence has been 313 increasing in Pakistan as shown by PNNS 2018 results, with wasting noted in 17.7% of 314 children, the highest in Pakistan's history, prevalence of overweight children under-five 315 almost doubling from 5% in 2011 to 9.5% in 2018, and women ages 15-49 experiencing 316 an increase in overweight and obesity increasing from 28% to 37.8% from 2011 to 2018. 317 Both, DBMHL and DBM, can co-exist with maternal-child BMI-WHZ concordance, as the 318 increasing burden of DBM, with an increasing percentage of overweight children, could


347 statistically significant positive factor across all GLM analyses. This association existing 348 in Pakistan is well established in the literature [59-64]. Increasing wealth quintile has 349 been suggested to correlate with access to nutrient rich foods and increased sedentary 350 behaviors [18,65-68].

## 132 India ,
IndiaNorway, Oman and the United States of America [23,24]. For example, a WHZ of 133 -2 indicates that the child's weight is two standard deviations below the mean for their 134 height and sex [25]. 135 Maternal weight status: Body Mass Index (BMI) Several other covariates were also considered in the analysis. A covariate was 143 included in statistical the models if it had evidence of correlation with child weight144 outcome and if there was sufficient variation in the covariate for it to add information to 145 the model, e.g. if a factor has 99% 'yes' response rate and 1% 'no' rate, then its use 146 was avoided because it would not meaningfully explain variation in the outcome.is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review) Household wealth status was measured as quintiles of assets as provided by the 153 PDHS-7 survey. Wealth index quintile categories were labeled as richest, rich, middle, 154 poor, poorest[ref]. Child sex was coded as male or female[ref]. Type of place of 155 residence was coded as urban or rural[ref]. Mother's employment status, youngest child 156 under-five and oldest child under-five were all codes as no or yes[ref]. 163 children and their mothers, it is important to consider the impact of children being born 164 small for gestational age (SGA) can have on anthropometric concordance. This is136 
The primary exposure of interest for this study was maternal BMI. BMI was 

137 measured in the same way as child WHZ, with SECA 878U scales and Shorr Boards 

138 (standing height measurement). Maternal BMI was coded as obese (30 or greater), 

139 overweight (25 to less than 30), healthy weight (18.5 to less than 25), and underweight 

140 (less than 18.5), which was the reference category ([ref]). 

141 Covariates 

142 
147 Through this process, the following eight covariates were selected for analysis: urban/ 

148 rural specific wealth index [18,22,26-28], sex of child [22,26], mother's employment 

149 status[26,27,29], type of place of residence [28,30-32], mother's youngest child under-

150 five [28,33,34], mother's oldest child under-five [28,33,34], child age in months, and 

151 maternal age in years [29,33,34].

157 Analysis 

158 
159 
A dyadic dataset of mothers and their children was created by merging 

160 anthropometric and demographic characteristics of mothers and children per DHS 

161 guidance for analysis. Mother's characteristics were treated as exposures for the child 

162 [35]. Furthermore, in studying cardiometabolic risk concordance between younger 

165 particularly important consideration in Pakistan, where the prevalence of SGA births is 

166 >45% [36]. As approximately 85% of children born SGA have experienced sufficient 

167 catch up growth by age 2 [37-39], stratifying analysis by this age point in relation to 

168 concordance which, to our knowledge, has not been done before, could yield important 

169 findings regarding the 'unmasking' of parent-child concordance. Thus, we stratified 

170 children by two years of age in our analysis and modeling. 

171 
All analysis and modeling accounted for the complex survey design [35]. All data 

172 restructuring and analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics v29.0.0.0 with Complex 

173 Samples v29. The code used for restructuring and analysis can be found via the

209 and their WHZ was not reported. Similarly, women who had BMI below 12 or above 60 210 were also flagged and did not have their BMI reported[35]. Further consideration of 211 outliers was not made because of these adjustments by the PDHS data processing 212 team. For the analysis, out of 4671 sample unweighted cases, 4130 had complete 215 variable information (with 541 missing) and were included, which led to a sampling-weight 216 adjusted sample size of 3465. With cases that had information on maternal BMI and child 217 WHZ, only two did not have complete information on the other covariates.;

199 Further Considerations for Analysis 

200 
201 
We assessed multicollinearity between the independent variables using the 

202 variance inflation factor (VIF) calculation. We used a conservative cutoff of 3, as an 

203 indicator to further investigate relationships [40]. Using this cutoff, no multicollinearity 

204 was observed among the independent variables. To account for multiple comparisons 

205 and counter the increased risk of Type I error, the Holm-Bonferroni method was used to 

206 adjust the P-value of 0.05 accordingly [41,42]. Regarding outliers, the DHS data is 

207 screened before dissemination for plausibility of Z-scores. For children who had WHZ 

208 that were below -5 standard deviations or above +5 standard deviations were flagged

The study was reviewed and approved by the National Bioethics Committee of 107 the Pakistan Health Research Council and the Inner City Fund/ ICF Institutional Review 108 Board. Adult participants were consented both, for themselves and for their children 109 [21]. Prior to obtaining access to and performing analysis on the PDHS-7 data, the 110 researchers of the present study submitted a concept note, gained data access, and 111 obtained permission from USAID. The data were de-identified and anonymized by the 112 DHS program prior to being shared, therefore not considered human subjects research 113 by an author-affiliated institution (Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA) and not requiring 114 further ethical clearance.


# Study Measures

116 117 Child weight status: Weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) 118 Child weight and height measurements were taken during a single visit. Weight 119 measurements were taken using SECA scales (model no. SECA 878U) and height 120 measurements using a Shorr Board (recumbent if child's age was less than 24 months 121 and standing if older). Anthropometry data in PDHS-7 was collected by two female 122 enumerators in each field team (total of 44 enumerators) who jointly took 123 measurements. All enumerators were trained beforehand to standardize procedures for 124 anthropometry, including hands-on training to measure ten children twice to assess 125 accuracy and precision of measurements and further training for those enumerators 126 who were out of range more three or more times [21].

Considering strengths of this study, the analysis was done on a nationally 352 representative dataset which involved a complex sampling process to obtain the best 353 possible demographic snapshot of Pakistan. The analysis also included a significant 354 number of covariates to unveil potential confounders and used rigid levels of correction 355 and validation regarding significance and multi-collinearity. Limitations of the study 356 included the use of cross-sectional data, whereas a cohort study could provide more in-357 depth data on trends in specific households.


## 358

Overall, the findings of maternal-child concordance and, more specifically, the 359 'masking' phenomenon could have important implications regarding interventions and 360 policy making, where these seemingly non-concordant groups may be ignored as an 361 avenue to improve NCD risk unless there is data suggesting that the concordance may 362 'unmask' later. Future work should involve more detailed data collection of 363 cardiometabolic disease and, more broadly, NCD risk concordance and outcome .

180 intervals. Other reported adjusted population descriptive statistics were percentage of 181 dyads that were urban vs rural, percentage of male and female children, percentage of 182 mothers currently employed, percentage of children being the youngest child, 183 percentage of children being the oldest under-five, and the percentage of the sample 184 size in each wealth index quintile. The mean child WHZ with 95% confidence interval 185 and sampling weight-adjusted sample size was also reported for each factor level. 186 Modeling associations between maternal and child weight status 187 188 We estimated linear regression models to investigate concordance between 189 maternal BMI and child WHZ, measured continuously. Three linear models were 190 generated: 1) all children under-five years, 2) all children under-two years, 3) all children 191 ages 2 to 5, with the models adjusted for the 8 covariates. We reported the R 2 value and 192 the Wald F for each model and reported the parameter estimates with 95% confidence 193 interval and t-test value for each categorical level. For each model, the statistically 194 significant variables were remodeled including only these variables and an additional 195 term for each two-variable combination to assess for interaction between the statistically 196 significant variables. Cases with missing values for any variables were treated as 197 invalid. Associations for all models were considered statistically significant when p < 198 0.05.


mean child WHZ was in children who belonged to the richest quintile of 228 households at 0.04 (95% CI [-0.09, 0.17]), and the category with the lowest mean child 229 WHZ was children with mothers who were underweight at -0.66 (95% CI [-0.80, -0.51]).

## 287
Overall variable p-values in parenthesis denote statistically significant associations (Holm-Bonferroni 288 corrected) 289 * denotes reference category 290 Discussion and Conclusion291   We found that maternal BMI was positively associated with child WHZ in children 292 under 5. This positive association was present for children ages 2 to 5, even after 293 accounting for several socio-demographic factors, but not for children under-two. The 294 findings suggest that there is intergenerational concordance in weight status in Pakistani 295 mothers and young children which is unmasked with increased age.


findings of parent-child concordance of BMI-WHZ for all children under-five 297 are consistent with previous literature which specifically explore parent-child concordance 298 of NCD risk [2,11-16] and of association studies in South Asia which have observed a 299 positive association between maternal and children under-five weight status [17,18].300 However, previously described phenomenon of the double burden of malnutrition at 301 household level (DBMHL) suggests co-existence of undernourished children and 302 overweight mothers in the same household, but this phenomenon is primarily described 303 for child stunting and, in some cases, underweight [43-51]. Although a recent study by 304 Biswas et al., in which they analyzed the co-existence of overweight mothers with all types 305 of undernourished children under-five (stunted, wasted, and underweight) in South and 306 Southeast Asia from 2006 to 2017 data, described positive relationships between 307 maternal weight status and all three types of child undernutrition, with the greatest co-308 existence in Pakistan. However, this study did not analyze the relationship between non-309 overweight or obese mothers and their children, nor did it split the children under-five into 310 two age groups [52]. 311 Furthermore, double burden of malnutrition (DBM) at the country or population 312 level is well-established in previous literature [53-56]. DBM prevalence has been 313 increasing in Pakistan as shown by PNNS 2018 results, with wasting noted in 17.7% of 314 children, the highest in Pakistan's history, prevalence of overweight children under-five 315 almost doubling from 5% in 2011 to 9.5% in 2018, and women ages 15-49 experiencing 316 an increase in overweight and obesity increasing from 28% to 37.8% from 2011 to 2018. 317 Both, DBMHL and DBM, can co-exist with maternal-child BMI-WHZ concordance, as the 318 increasing burden of DBM, with an increasing percentage of overweight children, could


347 statistically significant positive factor across all GLM analyses. This association existing 348 in Pakistan is well established in the literature [59-64]. Increasing wealth quintile has 349 been suggested to correlate with access to nutrient rich foods and increased sedentary 350 behaviors [18,65-68].

## 132 India ,
IndiaNorway, Oman and the United States of America [23,24]. For example, a WHZ of 133 -2 indicates that the child's weight is two standard deviations below the mean for their 134 height and sex [25]. 135 Maternal weight status: Body Mass Index (BMI) Several other covariates were also considered in the analysis. A covariate was 143 included in statistical the models if it had evidence of correlation with child weight144 outcome and if there was sufficient variation in the covariate for it to add information to 145 the model, e.g. if a factor has 99% 'yes' response rate and 1% 'no' rate, then its use 146 was avoided because it would not meaningfully explain variation in the outcome.is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review) Household wealth status was measured as quintiles of assets as provided by the 153 PDHS-7 survey. Wealth index quintile categories were labeled as richest, rich, middle, 154 poor, poorest[ref]. Child sex was coded as male or female[ref]. Type of place of 155 residence was coded as urban or rural[ref]. Mother's employment status, youngest child 156 under-five and oldest child under-five were all codes as no or yes[ref]. 163 children and their mothers, it is important to consider the impact of children being born 164 small for gestational age (SGA) can have on anthropometric concordance. This is136 
The primary exposure of interest for this study was maternal BMI. BMI was 

137 measured in the same way as child WHZ, with SECA 878U scales and Shorr Boards 

138 (standing height measurement). Maternal BMI was coded as obese (30 or greater), 

139 overweight (25 to less than 30), healthy weight (18.5 to less than 25), and underweight 

140 (less than 18.5), which was the reference category ([ref]). 

141 Covariates 

142 
147 Through this process, the following eight covariates were selected for analysis: urban/ 

148 rural specific wealth index [18,22,26-28], sex of child [22,26], mother's employment 

149 status[26,27,29], type of place of residence [28,30-32], mother's youngest child under-

150 five [28,33,34], mother's oldest child under-five [28,33,34], child age in months, and 

151 maternal age in years [29,33,34].

157 Analysis 

158 
159 
A dyadic dataset of mothers and their children was created by merging 

160 anthropometric and demographic characteristics of mothers and children per DHS 

161 guidance for analysis. Mother's characteristics were treated as exposures for the child 

162 [35]. Furthermore, in studying cardiometabolic risk concordance between younger 

165 particularly important consideration in Pakistan, where the prevalence of SGA births is 

166 >45% [36]. As approximately 85% of children born SGA have experienced sufficient 

167 catch up growth by age 2 [37-39], stratifying analysis by this age point in relation to 

168 concordance which, to our knowledge, has not been done before, could yield important 

169 findings regarding the 'unmasking' of parent-child concordance. Thus, we stratified 

170 children by two years of age in our analysis and modeling. 

171 
All analysis and modeling accounted for the complex survey design [35]. All data 

172 restructuring and analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics v29.0.0.0 with Complex 

173 Samples v29. The code used for restructuring and analysis can be found via the

209 and their WHZ was not reported. Similarly, women who had BMI below 12 or above 60 210 were also flagged and did not have their BMI reported[35]. Further consideration of 211 outliers was not made because of these adjustments by the PDHS data processing 212 team. For the analysis, out of 4671 sample unweighted cases, 4130 had complete 215 variable information (with 541 missing) and were included, which led to a sampling-weight 216 adjusted sample size of 3465. With cases that had information on maternal BMI and child 217 WHZ, only two did not have complete information on the other covariates.;

199 Further Considerations for Analysis 

200 
201 
We assessed multicollinearity between the independent variables using the 

202 variance inflation factor (VIF) calculation. We used a conservative cutoff of 3, as an 

203 indicator to further investigate relationships [40]. Using this cutoff, no multicollinearity 

204 was observed among the independent variables. To account for multiple comparisons 

205 and counter the increased risk of Type I error, the Holm-Bonferroni method was used to 

206 adjust the P-value of 0.05 accordingly [41,42]. Regarding outliers, the DHS data is 

207 screened before dissemination for plausibility of Z-scores. For children who had WHZ 

208 that were below -5 standard deviations or above +5 standard deviations were flagged

The study was reviewed and approved by the National Bioethics Committee of 107 the Pakistan Health Research Council and the Inner City Fund/ ICF Institutional Review 108 Board. Adult participants were consented both, for themselves and for their children 109 [21]. Prior to obtaining access to and performing analysis on the PDHS-7 data, the 110 researchers of the present study submitted a concept note, gained data access, and 111 obtained permission from USAID. The data were de-identified and anonymized by the 112 DHS program prior to being shared, therefore not considered human subjects research 113 by an author-affiliated institution (Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA) and not requiring 114 further ethical clearance.


# Study Measures

116 117 Child weight status: Weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) 118 Child weight and height measurements were taken during a single visit. Weight 119 measurements were taken using SECA scales (model no. SECA 878U) and height 120 measurements using a Shorr Board (recumbent if child's age was less than 24 months 121 and standing if older). Anthropometry data in PDHS-7 was collected by two female 122 enumerators in each field team (total of 44 enumerators) who jointly took 123 measurements. All enumerators were trained beforehand to standardize procedures for 124 anthropometry, including hands-on training to measure ten children twice to assess 125 accuracy and precision of measurements and further training for those enumerators 126 who were out of range more three or more times [21].

Considering strengths of this study, the analysis was done on a nationally 352 representative dataset which involved a complex sampling process to obtain the best 353 possible demographic snapshot of Pakistan. The analysis also included a significant 354 number of covariates to unveil potential confounders and used rigid levels of correction 355 and validation regarding significance and multi-collinearity. Limitations of the study 356 included the use of cross-sectional data, whereas a cohort study could provide more in-357 depth data on trends in specific households.


## 358

Overall, the findings of maternal-child concordance and, more specifically, the 359 'masking' phenomenon could have important implications regarding interventions and 360 policy making, where these seemingly non-concordant groups may be ignored as an 361 avenue to improve NCD risk unless there is data suggesting that the concordance may 362 'unmask' later. Future work should involve more detailed data collection of 363 cardiometabolic disease and, more broadly, NCD risk concordance and outcome .

180 intervals. Other reported adjusted population descriptive statistics were percentage of 181 dyads that were urban vs rural, percentage of male and female children, percentage of 182 mothers currently employed, percentage of children being the youngest child, 183 percentage of children being the oldest under-five, and the percentage of the sample 184 size in each wealth index quintile. The mean child WHZ with 95% confidence interval 185 and sampling weight-adjusted sample size was also reported for each factor level. 186 Modeling associations between maternal and child weight status 187 188 We estimated linear regression models to investigate concordance between 189 maternal BMI and child WHZ, measured continuously. Three linear models were 190 generated: 1) all children under-five years, 2) all children under-two years, 3) all children 191 ages 2 to 5, with the models adjusted for the 8 covariates. We reported the R 2 value and 192 the Wald F for each model and reported the parameter estimates with 95% confidence 193 interval and t-test value for each categorical level. For each model, the statistically 194 significant variables were remodeled including only these variables and an additional 195 term for each two-variable combination to assess for interaction between the statistically 196 significant variables. Cases with missing values for any variables were treated as 197 invalid. Associations for all models were considered statistically significant when p < 198 0.05.


mean child WHZ was in children who belonged to the richest quintile of 228 households at 0.04 (95% CI [-0.09, 0.17]), and the category with the lowest mean child 229 WHZ was children with mothers who were underweight at -0.66 (95% CI [-0.80, -0.51]).

## 287
Overall variable p-values in parenthesis denote statistically significant associations (Holm-Bonferroni 288 corrected) 289 * denotes reference category 290 Discussion and Conclusion291   We found that maternal BMI was positively associated with child WHZ in children 292 under 5. This positive association was present for children ages 2 to 5, even after 293 accounting for several socio-demographic factors, but not for children under-two. The 294 findings suggest that there is intergenerational concordance in weight status in Pakistani 295 mothers and young children which is unmasked with increased age.


findings of parent-child concordance of BMI-WHZ for all children under-five 297 are consistent with previous literature which specifically explore parent-child concordance 298 of NCD risk [2,11-16] and of association studies in South Asia which have observed a 299 positive association between maternal and children under-five weight status [17,18].300 However, previously described phenomenon of the double burden of malnutrition at 301 household level (DBMHL) suggests co-existence of undernourished children and 302 overweight mothers in the same household, but this phenomenon is primarily described 303 for child stunting and, in some cases, underweight [43-51]. Although a recent study by 304 Biswas et al., in which they analyzed the co-existence of overweight mothers with all types 305 of undernourished children under-five (stunted, wasted, and underweight) in South and 306 Southeast Asia from 2006 to 2017 data, described positive relationships between 307 maternal weight status and all three types of child undernutrition, with the greatest co-308 existence in Pakistan. However, this study did not analyze the relationship between non-309 overweight or obese mothers and their children, nor did it split the children under-five into 310 two age groups [52]. 311 Furthermore, double burden of malnutrition (DBM) at the country or population 312 level is well-established in previous literature [53-56]. DBM prevalence has been 313 increasing in Pakistan as shown by PNNS 2018 results, with wasting noted in 17.7% of 314 children, the highest in Pakistan's history, prevalence of overweight children under-five 315 almost doubling from 5% in 2011 to 9.5% in 2018, and women ages 15-49 experiencing 316 an increase in overweight and obesity increasing from 28% to 37.8% from 2011 to 2018. 317 Both, DBMHL and DBM, can co-exist with maternal-child BMI-WHZ concordance, as the 318 increasing burden of DBM, with an increasing percentage of overweight children, could


347 statistically significant positive factor across all GLM analyses. This association existing 348 in Pakistan is well established in the literature [59-64]. Increasing wealth quintile has 349 been suggested to correlate with access to nutrient rich foods and increased sedentary 350 behaviors [18,65-68].

## 132 India ,
IndiaNorway, Oman and the United States of America [23,24]. For example, a WHZ of 133 -2 indicates that the child's weight is two standard deviations below the mean for their 134 height and sex [25]. 135 Maternal weight status: Body Mass Index (BMI) Several other covariates were also considered in the analysis. A covariate was 143 included in statistical the models if it had evidence of correlation with child weight144 outcome and if there was sufficient variation in the covariate for it to add information to 145 the model, e.g. if a factor has 99% 'yes' response rate and 1% 'no' rate, then its use 146 was avoided because it would not meaningfully explain variation in the outcome.is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review) Household wealth status was measured as quintiles of assets as provided by the 153 PDHS-7 survey. Wealth index quintile categories were labeled as richest, rich, middle, 154 poor, poorest[ref]. Child sex was coded as male or female[ref]. Type of place of 155 residence was coded as urban or rural[ref]. Mother's employment status, youngest child 156 under-five and oldest child under-five were all codes as no or yes[ref]. 163 children and their mothers, it is important to consider the impact of children being born 164 small for gestational age (SGA) can have on anthropometric concordance. This is136 
The primary exposure of interest for this study was maternal BMI. BMI was 

137 measured in the same way as child WHZ, with SECA 878U scales and Shorr Boards 

138 (standing height measurement). Maternal BMI was coded as obese (30 or greater), 

139 overweight (25 to less than 30), healthy weight (18.5 to less than 25), and underweight 

140 (less than 18.5), which was the reference category ([ref]). 

141 Covariates 

142 
147 Through this process, the following eight covariates were selected for analysis: urban/ 

148 rural specific wealth index [18,22,26-28], sex of child [22,26], mother's employment 

149 status[26,27,29], type of place of residence [28,30-32], mother's youngest child under-

150 five [28,33,34], mother's oldest child under-five [28,33,34], child age in months, and 

151 maternal age in years [29,33,34].

157 Analysis 

158 
159 
A dyadic dataset of mothers and their children was created by merging 

160 anthropometric and demographic characteristics of mothers and children per DHS 

161 guidance for analysis. Mother's characteristics were treated as exposures for the child 

162 [35]. Furthermore, in studying cardiometabolic risk concordance between younger 

165 particularly important consideration in Pakistan, where the prevalence of SGA births is 

166 >45% [36]. As approximately 85% of children born SGA have experienced sufficient 

167 catch up growth by age 2 [37-39], stratifying analysis by this age point in relation to 

168 concordance which, to our knowledge, has not been done before, could yield important 

169 findings regarding the 'unmasking' of parent-child concordance. Thus, we stratified 

170 children by two years of age in our analysis and modeling. 

171 
All analysis and modeling accounted for the complex survey design [35]. All data 

172 restructuring and analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics v29.0.0.0 with Complex 

173 Samples v29. The code used for restructuring and analysis can be found via the

209 and their WHZ was not reported. Similarly, women who had BMI below 12 or above 60 210 were also flagged and did not have their BMI reported[35]. Further consideration of 211 outliers was not made because of these adjustments by the PDHS data processing 212 team. For the analysis, out of 4671 sample unweighted cases, 4130 had complete 215 variable information (with 541 missing) and were included, which led to a sampling-weight 216 adjusted sample size of 3465. With cases that had information on maternal BMI and child 217 WHZ, only two did not have complete information on the other covariates.;

199 Further Considerations for Analysis 

200 
201 
We assessed multicollinearity between the independent variables using the 

202 variance inflation factor (VIF) calculation. We used a conservative cutoff of 3, as an 

203 indicator to further investigate relationships [40]. Using this cutoff, no multicollinearity 

204 was observed among the independent variables. To account for multiple comparisons 

205 and counter the increased risk of Type I error, the Holm-Bonferroni method was used to 

206 adjust the P-value of 0.05 accordingly [41,42]. Regarding outliers, the DHS data is 

207 screened before dissemination for plausibility of Z-scores. For children who had WHZ 

208 that were below -5 standard deviations or above +5 standard deviations were flagged

319 be leading to the more recent findings of positives association of maternal-child weight 320 status. Co-existence of these phenomena within the same society highlight the complexity 321 of interventions and approaches required to address malnutrition among LMICs, as 322 different regions and households are experiencing various challenges. To our knowledge, there are no studies which specifically investigate the 324 relationship between maternal and child concordance under-five stratified by 2 years of 325 age, as we analyzed in this study. These findings, which show a positive association 326 between maternal BMI and child WHZ only in the 2 to 5 age group, potentially indicate 327 that concordance between child WHZ and maternal BMI is 'unmasked' after age 2, when328 the majority of early childhood catch-up growth has occurred [37-39]. As in, children who 329 may be born SGA may not show concordance of WHZ with maternal BMI during the first 330 two years of life, but as they experience their expected catch up growth and have spent 331 more time in a shared environment with their mothers, their weight status starts to become 332 concordant with their mothers, as seen by our analysis which shows the difference in 333 association between children older than and younger than two. This suggests that 334 children under-two who do not initially appear to have WHZ concordant to their mother's 335 BMI may develop this positive relationship later in life. Furthermore, a targeted review on 336 maternal and child overweight and obesity in LMICs shows that junk food, such as potato 337 chips, sponge cakes, sugary biscuits, and sugary drinks are a significant part of child diet 338 by the first two years of life [57], potentially yielding an avenue of intervention and an 339 explanation for the development of mother-child concordance after two years of age. This 340 relationship could also be affected by other dietary aspects such as breastfeeding status 341 and weaning, as prolongation of breastfeeding has been shown to decrease excess .
