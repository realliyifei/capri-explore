Statistics from the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 have shown that the number of fatalities in the construction industry is five times greater than in other sectors. Utilizing 2011-2019 information from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, scientists distinguished 1,103 development laborer fatalities in 2019. Thus, there is a critical need to alleviate this issue.A study has been conducted to investigate the root causes of fall hazards on construction sites. Therefore, this research is intended to identify and highlight the types of fall hazards that are most commonly found at construction sites today and the main causes that contribute to falls, as well as the most effective solutions to overcome the fall hazards. The discoveries will be a suggestion to development organizations for creating compelling security programs for the avoidance of fall mishaps.

## INTRODUCTION

Construction sector is very essential and integral part of infrastructure development which givesthe tremendous boost to our country's economy. The development business has enlisted gigantic development worldwide lately. Albeit the advancement of innovation is fast in a large portion of the areas, development work is still work concentrated.

The development area is the most risky ventures. Consistently, individuals pass on because of word related mishaps or business related sicknesses. Altogether, it arrives at more than 2.78 million passing and about 374 million non-deadly business related wounds and ailments every year [26]. The human expense of this everyday misfortune is huge, and the monetary weight of poor word related security and wellbeing rehearses is assessed at 3.94% of global Gross Domestic Product each year [26]. Internationally, among all, accidental wounds address a significant general medical issue and a main source of passing [27]. After street traffic wounds, falls address the subsequent driving reason for accidental injury passing around the world. Estimation is a number of 646000 fatal falls and some 37.3 million non-fatal falls each year, severe enough to require medical attention [28].

A peril is an expected wellspring of mischief or an antagonistic wellbeing impact on people. Risk is the probability that an individual might be hurt or experienced antagonistic wellbeing impacts whenever presented to a peril. Hence, chance can be limited, albeit the risk is there. Two significant perils that are normal in building locales have been distinguished by Abdul et al [1]. Actual injury dangers are regularly brought about by hardware utilized, for example, frameworks, power access gear, stepping stools, plant and apparatus for uncovering and cycles like manual dealing with, and rooftop work [1]. These risks can make direct injury laborers at site and, if extreme, it might actually cause passing.

This study is concentration to recognize the reasons for mishaps at tall structure building site and to distinguish the preventive measures for mishaps at tall structure building site. Other than that, this exploration helps in making sense of the reasons for mishaps and recognizing region where avoidance activity ought to be carried out, so laborers and top administration will increment mindfulness in forestalling site mishaps.


## Objective of the study-

The aim of the study is to identify the all possible hazards related to fall in High-rise Building Construction, to conduct occupational health risk assessment, to calculate the risk rating based on the risk matrix and to compare the risk rating before & after the control measure taken.

The study of this subject is to reduce injuries related to working at height, raise awareness of OHSW obligations and our workplace services profile in the construction industry, a coordinated approach by team in the method of addressing identified hazards, measure improvement by comparison of workplace condition assessment data.


## II-LITERATURE REVIEW

Falls are one of the OSHA's Focus Four that causes deaths of workers on construction site [24]. Fall is characterized as a descending development right down to the floor. A fall danger is a sort of actual perils that cause specialist's misfortune body balance when work at building site. Falls are generally causes by perilous demonstration, hazardous working condition, correspondence issues and the executive's responsibility. The workers that are introduced to fall chances are cause by their attitude on prosperity and prosperity confirmation is a pointless utilization that can be saved and the shortfall of correspondence among workers and the person in charge [25].

The construction industry of Malaysia represents the epicenter of growth of the country and has been propelled by demand for high-rise building projects [12]. In the past 20 years, the construction industry had contributed 3-5 percent to the GDP and played a significant role in the development of the country [14]. Nonetheless, the unfortunate time execution is the most well-known in the Malaysian development industry and on account of this the vast majority of the undertakings in Malaysia are accounted for as being late [14,15]. Subsequently, the client and partners are confronting not kidding issues connected with monetary waste, quality misfortunes and burdens with delays in development projects [13]. The delay in construction projects affects the micro and macro levels of the economy of the country. At the miniature level connected with the expense overwhelm, project deserting while large scale level arrangements with the negative pace of public development of the country [16].

According to V. Sakthiniveditha et al. (2003) presumed that Building projects are one of the main undertakings which assume an essential part in the nation's turn of events. It is assessed that for the more prominent turn of events, the elevated structure (or) multi-story structures are the most fundamental piece of the development. The bigger piece of the structure prompts tall building towers. Thus the gamble engaged with this piece of the development business additionally positions higher. Takes a chance in development projects are viewed as one of the most well-known issues that cause various adverse consequences on the development projects. Building dangers must be limited when the reason is known. The point of this study was to investigate the gamble appraisal while developing elevated structures. This study was conducted based on a review of the literature and a questionnaire. The information for this examination will be assembled through an itemized review of polls. The survey comprises of two areas and the main segment comprises of general inquiries, the subsequent segment contains the rundown of significant dangers and the sub-gambles implied. This work centers on recognizing and evaluating the dangers in elevated structures, and upgrading the dangers that happen during building development. [5] Ahsan Nawazet al. (2019) presumes that Building is a very hazardous business that misses the mark on great standing for risk the executives. However, because of expanded contention and development exercises this steadily gives it really meaning. That's what the exploration shows, in the feeling of territory Low-level gamble control was applied. The discoveries likewise demonstrate that there is a more noteworthy level of relationship between certain gamble the board and undertaking productivity. The outcomes exhibit the significance of hazard the executive's procedures, their utilization, inclusion and impact on the presentation of the worker for hire's development projects perspective, along these lines empowering the primary task members to utilize risk the board. [7] Pitroda et al. (2021) given Information on Identification of risk factors and expectations of Indian construction professionals, i.e. workers for hire, proprietors, project supervisors and designers, on the significance of various development dangers and how the dangers ought to be divided between contracting parties. Risk the board is the methodology that covers assessment risk investigation with the guide of answering subjectively and quantitatively with the suitable administration and control procedure. The term has gained unmistakable quality in different businesses. The system is also used indifferent companies for improving their output in their ventures to reduce their losses and improve their profits. The poll test is assessed with the utilization of the Overall Significance Record (RII) device for clients, workers for hire, specialists and engineers. We focused on understanding Gamble the board framework for development tasks and presenting inside and out data on the utilization of chance administration in tall structure projects. [4] Leenu Paul (2018) Risk the executives is an instrument for characterizing and dealing with specific dangers in an undertaking and with sufficient consideration. This study's philosophy relies upon the poll review that was assembled from the neighborhood skyscraper development workers for hire. Pilot study and interviews are conducted to identify the risk factors which affect the construction industry's efficiency. A sum of 24 gamble influencing factors in three divisions are recognized through pilot study and from master counsel. The risk management and assessment can be improved by combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies to analyze the risks. [8] According to Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994, section 24 [17], the employees are responsible to wear or use at every one of the hours of any defensive hardware or apparel which given by the business. Great housekeeping is the best safeguards against mishaps during development [19]. Therefore, good housekeeping is an important part in any construction site which helps to reduce occurrence of accidents and improve the overall safety performance [20]. Investigation is one of the normal types of examination to forestall any mishaps. Inspections are part of a preventive or proactive to accident prevention [18]. Training is an essential and significant piece of mishap anticipation strategy [21]. Every one of the organization ought to guarantee that the preparation program is an indispensable piece of the guidance given to all men in development work and ensure them specific consideration towards to the security issues [18]. Accordingly, there are important to carry out the fitting avoidance activity to successfully forestall the event mishaps.

## IV-CONCLUSION

The first step for emergency preparedness and maintaining a safe workplace is defining and analyzing hazards. Although all hazards should be addressed, resource limitations usually do not allow this to happen at one time. Identification of hazard and risk assessment can be used to establish priorities so that the most dangerous situations are addressed first and those least likely to occur and least likely to cause major problems can be considered later. The study also revealed that systematic methods were used and risk was assessed by brainstorming, checklist and health and safety regulations. Working at height observed to be most critical hazards in Indian Industry of construction site. Based on methods used to communicate risk at construction sites, it was revealed that toolbox meetings, site meetings, posters and informal verbal communication are used to communicate risk. It was also revealed that safety committees and gang supervisors play a major role in communicating health and safety risks. However the issue of power relations and conflicts was observed when there is a clear separation between health and safety communication and quality and productivity. The study also reveals that PPE is the main item used for risk control. However, there was enough PPE on the sites. Based on factors influencing risk management, the study reveals that legal system plays a major role in risk assessment, communication and control. The regulations provide for some hazards such as falling from a height and control mechanisms. They also require that health and safety risk to be communicated to workers and that PPE be provided for worker.
