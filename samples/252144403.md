Tuberculosis is commonly considered a pulmonary disease, although it may present in almost all organs.

One of the uncommon sites is the peritoneal cavity involving the ileocecal region or liver. Because of atypical clinical manifestations, which may include fever, emesis, anorexia and generalized peritonitis, the condition can be misdiagnosed as other more common abdominal pathologies including appendicitis, ovarian malignancy or cholecystitis leading to unnecessary extended surgery [2,3].

## Figure 1 :
1Laparoscopic image showing perihepatitis and signs of inflammatory adhesions. Background Globally, tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent (ranking above HIV/AIDS) and is still one of the top ten causes of death, despite the incidence rate declines with approximately two percent per year. Diagnosis and correct treatment of tuberculosis have prevented an estimated 54 million deaths over the period 2000-2017 [1].

## A 20 -
20year old previously healthy Eritrean male was admitted to the hospital with a two-day history of right-sided abdominal pain, pyrexia, headache and multiple vomiting episodes. He reported no significant past medical, surgical, or family history, no alcohol use, no herbal agents nor suspected drug use. Vital signs of the patients were in the normal ranges with 36.6°C body temperature, 120/60 mmHg arterial blood pressure and 72/min heartrate. Physical examination revealed right-sided abdominal tenderness, which was significant in the right hypochondrium and vague in the right iliac fossa. There were no signs of rebound tenderness, guarding or other signs of peritoneal reaction. Laboratory results reported an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 123 mg/L (normal: < 10 mg/L), increased International normalized ratio (INR) at 1.6 (normal: sample was sent to microbiological culture, and cytological testing showed inflammatory cells without malignant cells. No biopsy samples were obtained during laparoscopy.

The patient was transferred to the department of infectious diseases. Chest X-ray was inconclusive, but CT scan of thorax showed treein-bud pattern in the apex of both upper pulmonary lobes and the right lower lobe, along with nodular infiltrates and multiple cavities measuring up to two cm in diameter.

the number of entry points in the form of EDs. The reconfiguration process was set to start in 2007, with a goal of completion within 5-10 years. The aim of this study is to shed light on the effect of partial closure of an ED on the utilization of EDs. Methods: Our population-based historic cohort study was based on data from Statistics Denmark and from Danish health registries, including the Danish Civil Registration System and the Danish National Patient Registry. We included all nonpsychiatric ED contacts in citizens of Vejle municipal in the period 2014 to 2015 as Vejle ED on 5 January 2015 ceased its intake of acute orthopedic injuries between 10 pm and 7 am. As of 2015, Vejle municipality had 111,138 citizens. Contacts were excluded if patients where below 18 years old. For each contact emergency department utilized, residential municipal, and date of contact was extracted. Difference-in-difference (DID) estimation based on linear regression was employed, the dependent variable being aggregated daily ED contacts. The control group was defined as contacts between 7 am and 11 pm, and the cases being contacts between 11 pm and 7 am. Results: The study included a total of 39,659 contacts. Out of these 34,901 where between 7 am and 11 pm, and 4,758 where between 11 pm and 7 am. In days before 5 January 2015 there was on average 7.33 contacts between 11pm and 7am, in days after the average was 5.75 contacts, resulting in a 21.6% drop. The DID analysis' comparison of contacts before and after 5 January 2015 resulted in a coefficient of -2.07, p<0.01, 95%CI [-3.44, -0.70].


The 1-year program consists of different setups of time in certain specialty areas, encompassing the primary specialties internal medicine, abdominal surgery and orthopedic surgery. The education programs can be differently structured, but with the same end qualifications for the resident. We aimed to investigate the different structures of the education programs for the 1st year residency in Emergency Medicine in Denmark. Methods: All education programs were extracted from the three different medical educational regions in Denmark in March 2020. We reviewed all programs and the following data was extracted: Time in each primary specialty, medical courses, possibility to practice the role of team leader in critical ill patients and education in point-of-care ultrasound. Results: 20 of 21 emergency departments in Denmark employs residents in Emergency Medicine for their 1-year introductory residency. 13 of 20 programs assess patients in internal medicine and abdominal surgery in the same time period. 7 out of 20 has pre-specified time for patients in abdominal surgery. 10 of 20 programs does not have specified time in orthopedic surgery. This is part of the internal medicine period or not specified further. Only programs in The Region of Southern Denmark have pre-specified periods for all three main specialties. 14 of 20 programs present opportunity to participate in medical courses such as Advanced Life Support. Only 3 of 20 programs present opportunity for further education in point of care ultrasound, other than the obligatory focused lung ultrasound and ultrasound guided peripheral access. 7 of 20 programs present opportunity to participate in primary assessment of critical ill patients as team leader or observer, for critical care calls. Conclusion: The education programs in Denmark for Emergency Medicines 1st year residency varies greatly in both time in major specialties, medical courses, point-of-care ultrasound and training in the role as team leader. til publikation: 13-01-2022 Jensen et al, Higher paediatric readiness in emergency departments and trauma centres with a paediatrician on-site Dansk Tidsskrift for Akutmedicin, 2022, Vol. 1, s. 18 PUBLICERET AF DET KGL. BIBLIOTEK FOR DANSK TIDSSKRIFT FOR centres. Children constitute a smaller proportion of patients in these facilities, thus leading to the risk of poor quality of paediatric emergency care being provided. Studies show that day-to-day readiness for the emergency care of children affect paediatric patient safety and is associated with a reduced risk of mortality among critically ill children. This study aimed to assess the level of paediatric readiness in Danish emergency departments and trauma centres. We hypothesised that trauma centres had a higher paediatric readiness than emergency departments. Methods: From November 2020 to January 2021, a nationwide survey was conducted in all 18 Danish emergency departments and four trauma centres. The questionnaire was a Danish translation of the 2013 American assessment of paediatric readiness provided by the National Pediatric Readiness Project. Facility chief physicians were approached by phone and for those willing to participate, the questionnaire was e-mailed for completion by designated healthcare professionals working in the emergency department or trauma centre. Primary outcome was paediatric readiness, which was assessed using the weighted paediatric readiness score based on a scale from 0-100. A score of 100 points indicated full compliance with the 2009 American Guidelines for Care of Children in the Emergency Department. The weighted paediatric readiness score was presented as median with interquartile range (IQR). Our hypothesis was tested using the Mann-


an enhancement in experienced healthcare personnel, specialized equipment and the availability of medical specialists. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between length of stay at the hospital after a physical traumatic injury and the reconfiguration of emergency departments. Methods: The study was conducted as a retrospective cohort study including patients admitted as trauma patients at Hospital of South West Jutland within the Region of Southern Denmark and in the years 2007-2016. Statistical analyses were conducted using multiple linear regressions. Results: A total of 1693 trauma patients were included, of which 580 patients were admitted before the reconfiguration and 1113 were admitted after. The results showed a beta coefficient of -0.32 with a pvalue <0.001 and 95% confidence interval of -0.48 to -0.15, giving a 27.1% decrease in length of stay after the reconfiguration compared to before. Conclusion: After reconfiguring emergency departments, the length of stay for trauma patients has decreased, suggesting enhanced efficiency and increased the quality of care for trauma patients. til publikation: 13-01-2022 Galili et al, Low-Dose-Ketamine as an adjunct to morphine for acute pain in the ED: A protocol for a randomized, double-blinded, superiority trial Dansk Tidsskrift for Akutmedicin, 2022, Vol. 1, s. 20 PUBLICERET AF DET KGL. BIBLIOTEK FOR DANSK TIDSSKRIFT FOR AKUTMEDICIN 20 af 26 Low-Dose-Ketamine as an adjunct to morphine for acute pain in the ED: an essential and challenging part of emergency medicine and ineffective analgesia for patients attending the emergency department (ED) is common and can lead to complications, extended hospital stays and course of illness. Opioid-tolerant patients are an increasing challenge requiring different acute pain management, ie. needing much larger doses of opioids -which for a number of reasons they do not receive. The rising need for opioid sparing treatment and the difficulties in pain treatment of patients with a current use of opioids calls for clinical studies investigating effect and safety of alternatives. Low-Dose-Ketamine (LDK) has been studied as an analgesic and been shown to be useful in the reduction of acute pain in the postoperative setting. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of LDK as an adjunct to morphine in the treatment of pain in the ED. Hypothesis: LDK as an adjunct to morphine will be superior to morphine alone as regards of analgesic effect. The combination of morphine and LDK will result in a larger pain reduction in patients with a current use of opioids than patients with no prior use. combination of LDK and morphine versus IV morphine alone regarding analgesic effect. 152 patients fulfilling all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be stratified (prior use of opioids and no prior use of opioids) and randomized in a 1:1 ratio in the two groups. Perspectives: This is the first study to examine the effect of LDK as an adjunct to morphine in a general patient population in the ED with pain and to compare it with the effect for patients with a prior use of opioids. This study could present a better pain treatment for patients with and without a prior use of opioids.


telemedicine treatment of patients. In the Sjaelland Region patient referrals to the Emergency Department are based on telephone conversations with a Registered Nurse. Holbaek Emergency Department initiated a pilot study in 2019 with the objective of investigating the feasibility and potential of using photo/video as a tool in future referrals. Our hypothesis is that it can improve the referral process. Methods: The pilot study is retrospective and the approach deductive. The inclusion criteria is patients with lacerations who have been referred to the Emergency Department (ED) from the Acute Phone. 12 patients participated and consented to having photos taken of their laceration on the arrival to the ED. Twenty-five experienced Registered Nurses from the 4 Acute Phone sites in the Sjaelland Region participated. The study design is based on a control group and an investigation group. The control group is the 12 patient referrals to the ED based on the conversation on the Acute Phone. The investigation group is the 300 patient referrals provided by the retrospective review of the 12 patient photos by 25 Registered Nurses. In retrospective review the Registered Nurses either refer to the ED or own home treatment. The validation of referral with photo is investigated by measuring the congruity of the referrals in the investigation group. The potential is shown by comparing the referrals in the two groups. Results: Out of 300 photo referrals, the congruity of the Registered Nurses' referrals shows an agreement of 95% and a deviation of 5%, which shows the validity. 4 out of 12 patients with lacerations would have been referred to home treatment in the investigation group, with a referral agreement of 93%. While all 12 patients as the control group were referred to the Emergency Department. Conclusion: The results point towards a future process including photo/video contact, which will improve the ability of Registered Nurses' to provide appropriate referral and treatment instructions, and increase the number of patients referred to home treatment. Implementation of video contact on the Acute Phone starting January 2020, rolling out regionally in 2021.


without the use of presenting complaints. The aim of this study was to validate and compare two 5-level triage systems used in Danish emergency departments: "Danish Emergency Process Triage" (DEPT) based on vital signs and presenting complaints and a locally adapted version of DEPT (VITAL-TRIAGE) using vital signs only. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort in five Danish emergency departments. All patients attending an emergency department during the period of 1-4-2012 until 31-12-2015 were included. Validity of the two triagesystems were assessed by comparing urgency categories determined by each triagesystem with outcomes that resembles an urgent hospitalization: 24-hour ICU admission, two-day mortality, critical illness, surgery within 48 hours, 4hour discharge and length of stay. 04) in VITAL-TRIAGE. Length of stay were longer in VITAL-TRIAGE than DEPT. The sensitivity of DEPT to predict patients discharged within 4 hours was 0.91 (CI 0.91 : 0.92) while VITAL-TRIAGE was higher at 0.99 (CI 0.99 : 0.99). The odds ratio for 24-hour ICU admission and two-day mortality was increased in high-urgency categories of both triage systems compared to low-urgency categories. Conclusion: High urgency categories in both triagesystem are associated with adverse outcomes.

Methods: The study was conducted as a retrospective cohort study including patients admitted as trauma patients at Hospital of South West Jutland within the Region of Southern Denmark and in the years 2007-2016. Statistical analyses were conducted using multiple linear regressions. Results: A total of 1693 trauma patients were included, of which 580 patients were admitted before the reconfiguration and 1113 were admitted after. The results showed a beta coefficient of -0.32 with a pvalue <0.001 and 95% confidence interval of -0.48 to -0.15, giving a 27.1% decrease in length of stay after the reconfiguration compared to before. Conclusion: After reconfiguring emergency departments, the length of stay for trauma patients has decreased, suggesting enhanced efficiency and increased the quality of care for trauma patients. til publikation: 13-01-2022 Galili et al, Low-Dose-Ketamine as an adjunct to morphine for acute pain in the ED: A protocol for a randomized, double-blinded, superiority trial Dansk Tidsskrift for Akutmedicin, 2022, Vol. 1, s. 20 PUBLICERET AF DET KGL. BIBLIOTEK FOR DANSK TIDSSKRIFT FOR AKUTMEDICIN 20 af 26 Low-Dose-Ketamine as an adjunct to morphine for acute pain in the ED: an essential and challenging part of emergency medicine and ineffective analgesia for patients attending the emergency department (ED) is common and can lead to complications, extended hospital stays and course of illness. Opioid-tolerant patients are an increasing challenge requiring different acute pain management, ie. needing much larger doses of opioids -which for a number of reasons they do not receive. The rising need for opioid sparing treatment and the difficulties in pain treatment of patients with a current use of opioids calls for clinical studies investigating effect and safety of alternatives. Low-Dose-Ketamine (LDK) has been studied as an analgesic and been shown to be useful in the reduction of acute pain in the postoperative setting. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of LDK as an adjunct to morphine in the treatment of pain in the ED. Hypothesis: LDK as an adjunct to morphine will be superior to morphine alone as regards of analgesic effect. The combination of morphine and LDK will result in a larger pain reduction in patients with a current use of opioids than patients with no prior use. combination of LDK and morphine versus IV morphine alone regarding analgesic effect. 152 patients fulfilling all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be stratified (prior use of opioids and no prior use of opioids) and randomized in a 1:1 ratio in the two groups. Perspectives: This is the first study to examine the effect of LDK as an adjunct to morphine in a general patient population in the ED with pain and to compare it with the effect for patients with a prior use of opioids. This study could present a better pain treatment for patients with and without a prior use of opioids.


telemedicine treatment of patients. In the Sjaelland Region patient referrals to the Emergency Department are based on telephone conversations with a Registered Nurse. Holbaek Emergency Department initiated a pilot study in 2019 with the objective of investigating the feasibility and potential of using photo/video as a tool in future referrals. Our hypothesis is that it can improve the referral process. Methods: The pilot study is retrospective and the approach deductive. The inclusion criteria is patients with lacerations who have been referred to the Emergency Department (ED) from the Acute Phone. 12 patients participated and consented to having photos taken of their laceration on the arrival to the ED. Twenty-five experienced Registered Nurses from the 4 Acute Phone sites in the Sjaelland Region participated. The study design is based on a control group and an investigation group. The control group is the 12 patient referrals to the ED based on the conversation on the Acute Phone. The investigation group is the 300 patient referrals provided by the retrospective review of the 12 patient photos by 25 Registered Nurses. In retrospective review the Registered Nurses either refer to the ED or own home treatment. The validation of referral with photo is investigated by measuring the congruity of the referrals in the investigation group. The potential is shown by comparing the referrals in the two groups. Results: Out of 300 photo referrals, the congruity of the Registered Nurses' referrals shows an agreement of 95% and a deviation of 5%, which shows the validity. 4 out of 12 patients with lacerations would have been referred to home treatment in the investigation group, with a referral agreement of 93%. While all 12 patients as the control group were referred to the Emergency Department. Conclusion: The results point towards a future process including photo/video contact, which will improve the ability of Registered Nurses' to provide appropriate referral and treatment instructions, and increase the number of patients referred to home treatment. Implementation of video contact on the Acute Phone starting January 2020, rolling out regionally in 2021.


without the use of presenting complaints. The aim of this study was to validate and compare two 5-level triage systems used in Danish emergency departments: "Danish Emergency Process Triage" (DEPT) based on vital signs and presenting complaints and a locally adapted version of DEPT (VITAL-TRIAGE) using vital signs only. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort in five Danish emergency departments. All patients attending an emergency department during the period of 1-4-2012 until 31-12-2015 were included. Validity of the two triagesystems were assessed by comparing urgency categories determined by each triagesystem with outcomes that resembles an urgent hospitalization: 24-hour ICU admission, two-day mortality, critical illness, surgery within 48 hours, 4hour discharge and length of stay. 04) in VITAL-TRIAGE. Length of stay were longer in VITAL-TRIAGE than DEPT. The sensitivity of DEPT to predict patients discharged within 4 hours was 0.91 (CI 0.91 : 0.92) while VITAL-TRIAGE was higher at 0.99 (CI 0.99 : 0.99). The odds ratio for 24-hour ICU admission and two-day mortality was increased in high-urgency categories of both triage systems compared to low-urgency categories. Conclusion: High urgency categories in both triagesystem are associated with adverse outcomes.

Thus, ascitic fluid cytology has high specificity but very low sensitivity from detection of weeks, by which PCR is superior in minimizing the time of diagnosis, but again lacks sensitivity.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on the 

previously collected peritoneal seropurulent exudate 

was negative. The gastric lavage and throat swab 

showed acid-fast bacillus positive along with PCR 

positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but 

resistance was inconclusive due to poor sample 

collection and was re-ordered. In addition, throat 

swab showed strains of mycoplasma pneumonia. 

Systemic therapy with a combination of isoniazid, 

ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin was initiated. 

The patient showed improvement and was 

discharged after two weeks with a follow-up at the 

outpatient clinic. Contact tracing for tuberculosis was 

performed without any new cases encountered. 

Discussion 

Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious disease, with 

a short incubation period approximately 2-12 weeks, 

it can still manifest within 2 years after 

Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) exposure. 

Because TB is a rarity in developed countries, 

abdominal tuberculosis is even rarer and often 

overlooked without a proper background history and 

therefore should be considered as a differential 

diagnosis in patients with recent travel activity to 

tuberculosis endemic areas. 

Because a positive QuantiFERON test does not 

distinguish between latent and active infection, 

acid-fast bacilli. Measuring the activity of adenosine 

deaminase (ADA) in ascitic fluid is a useful tool to 

detect abdominal tuberculosis in highly endemic 

areas. Levels higher than 0.40 uKat/l has a 100% 

sensitivity and a 99% specificity for diagnosing 

mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, its sensitivity 

and specificity are impeded in developed countries 

due to high prevalence of cirrhosis [4,5]. 

Moreover, radiological imaging lack both sensitivity 

and specificity due to diagnostic overlap with 

common radiological findings like ascites and nodular 

irregularities. Nevertheless, radiological imaging still 

has a place in localization of the disease after 

confirmed diagnosis. A CT-scan with contrast and a 

MRI can highlight infected areas in the body, and 

assist in differentiating pulmonary from extra-

pulmonary tuberculosis. Ultrasonograhic guidance is 

usually required to obtain biopsy material.

In the present case, tuberculosis was not suspected 

during laparoscopy. Intraperitoneal fluid but no 

biopsies were collected, which may had resulted in 

delay of diagnosis. In a retrospective study on 

peritoneal tuberculosis held in Tunisian, all patients 

(n=163) showed exudative ascites, 87 had miliary 

nodules and 69% had fibrous peritoneal adhesions. 

Additionally, 87% of cases showed caseating 

granulomas in peritoneal biopsies [6]. 

Bhargava et al classified peritoneal tuberculosis 

according to laparoscopic appearance. The three 

categories were 1: thickened peritoneum with yellow-

whitish miliary tubercles with or without adhesions 2: 

Only thickened peritoneum with or without adhesions 

3: only fibro adhesive patterns. The study concluded 

that specific medication might be started solely on 

the base of visualization through laparoscopy, as the 

visual diagnosis was accurate up to 95% [7]. 

Therefore, identification of Mycobacteria in any 

material is the gold standard when initiating anti-

tuberculous treatment. It can be confirmed by (a) the 

presence of acid-fast bacilli in a throat swab, GL 

lavage or ascitic fluid; (b) positive culture for M. 

Tuberculosis in any of the aforementioned; (c) PCR 

assay for mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, 

culture can further delay the diagnosis up to 4-8 

Conclusion 

The diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis is usually 

delayed due to presentation of non-specific 

abdominal symptoms, unpredictability of laboratory 

tests and lack of proper travel history, leading to 

laparoscopic surgery, which in turn can be a viable 

method for fluid and biopsy collection, along with a 

visual aid in detecting tuberculosis. 



Asmussen et al.Conclusion: This systematic review found no difference between Diphoterine compared with water or no treatment on depth of a chemical burn.Diphoterine seems to be associated with less pain compared to water or no treatment, and Diphoterine seems to have a neutralizing effect of chemical burns.Accepteret til publikation: 13-01-2022 Søvsø et al., Disease severity of ambulance patients with non-specific diagnoses Dansk Tidsskrift for Akutmedicin, 2022, Vol. 1, s. 11 PUBLICERET AF DET KGL.

Thus, in EMS patients discharged with non-specific diagnoses, we investigated renewed contacts within 30 days, changes in diagnoses and corresponding changes in 30-day mortality. Methods: Observational cohort study of patients brought to hospital after emergency call and discharged with an ICD-10-chapter Z or R diagnosis during 2016-2018 in the North Denmark Region. Mortality and renewed contacts (new contact within 30 days) were modelled by Poisson regression.

Conclusion: One third of included patients were assigned a non-specific diagnosis, and less than 10% had renewed contact within 30 days. Compared to patients with a non-specific diagnosis, patients given a specific ICD-10 diagnosis upon renewed contact had more comorbidity and more than a twofold increase in adjusted mortality risk.

BIBLIOTEK FOR DANSK TIDSSKRIFT FOR AKUTMEDICIN 12 af 26 Do nurses know their patients? Agreement between patients' self-reported degree-of-worry and nurses' estimation of patients' degree-of-worry Gamst-Jensen et al. centered around flow and production and to a lesser degree the patients' contextual perception of acute illness. Degree-of-worry is a simple subjective measure used to enable patients to rate their worry about the condition that initiated their contact to the acute health care system on a scale from 1 (minimally worried) to 10 (maximum worried). This study examines the agreement between patients' self-rated DOW and their nurses' estimation of the patients' DOW. Methods: A total of 194 patient/nurse-pair from the emergency department at Amager Hvidovre Hospital were asked to rate their DOW (patients) and estimate their patients' DOW (nurses). Patients' age, gender, triage level, and co-morbidity was registered alongside the corresponding nurses' age, gender andBackground: 
Early 

warning scores has been 

widely used as a triage tool 

but in some instances 

been limited in spotting

ill 
patients. 

Reduced mobility has 

been associated with 

short-term

increased 
length 
of 

hospital stays and has been suggested as an addition 

to early warning scores. Few studies investigated 

reliability of mobility scores. These have been in-

hospital and based on specific patient types. Scoring 

of patient mobility in ambulances can be troublesome 

due to a hectic environment. There are no studies 

investigating inter-rater agreement of a mobility score 

applicable to a wide range of patients prehospital. 

The objectives of this study were to test inter-rater 

agreement between two ambulance clinicians using a 

mobility score for the same prehospital patient. 

Secondary to compare clinicians to observers and 

test if there is a difference in scores between regions. 

Methods: A reliability study of a 4-category mobility 

score in the prehospital setting conducted on 

ambulance clinicians from the North-and Central 

Denmark Region and The Faroe Islands assessing 

patients. Data was collected between June 2020 to 

May 2021 and 251 ambulance patients' mobility 

scores were included. Data was evaluated by 

weighted kappa, Kruskall-Wallis and a post hoc Dunn 

test were used to examine differences in scoring 

between regions. 

Results: Inter-rater agreement between ambulance 

clinicians showed a kappa 0.84 (CI95%: 0.79;0.88). 

This was supported with observers for North 

Denmark Region and Faroe Islands kappa 0.82 

(CI95%: 0.77;0.86). 
Mobility scoring between 

ambulance clinicians in Central Denmark Region 

(n=93) and North Denmark Region (n=130) were not 

statistical different. The Faroe Islands (n=28) differed 

from the other regions (p<0.05). 

Conclusion: These results indicate that the mobility 

score has a high level of inter-rater-reliability in a 

prehospital setting when used by ambulance 

clinicians. 
Comparing 
agreements 
between 

examined regions and ambulance providers show 

high inter-rater-reliability between clinicians. 
The 

mobility score may contribute to future studies 

investigating mobility as a predictor of patient's 

mortality. This could provide knowledge about how to 

improve patient triage and might be included as a vital 

sign.

Contacts with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the 
Danish healthcare system from 2005-2016: A retrospective observational 
study 

Bentsen et al. 

Background: 
The 

combination of Deep Vein 

Thrombosis (DVT) and 

Pulmonary Embolism (PE), 

Venous 

Thromboembolism (VTE), 

is the third most frequent 

cardiovascular disease. It can lead to chronic 

complications and can be lethal in the acute phase. 

As age is a risk factor for an increasing incidence of 

VTE, the growing elderly population is expected to 

increase the number of VTE. With this study, we 

aimed to investigate the number of VTE contacts in 

the Danish healthcare system from 2005-2016 with 

focus on yearly, monthly and daily variation. 

Methods: We extracted data on patient contacts to 

all public Danish hospitals in the period from 2005-

2016 with a diagnosis of either DVT or PE (ICD-10 

diagnosis of I801, I802, I803, I808, I269, I269, I260 or 

I817D). Data will be presented descriptively as 

combined numbers but also stratified by weekday, 

month and year. 

Results: We observed 57,804 contacts with DVT and 

46,161 PE in the study period. DVT contacts was 

5,005 (8.7%) in 2005 and decreased by 5.5% to 4,734 

(8.2%) in 2016. For PE it we observed an increase of 

96.8% from 2,579 (5.6%) in 2005 to 5,075 (11.0%) in 

2016. When sampling months of all years, the month 

with the highest number of contacts for DVT were 

March with 5,150 (8.9%) and lowest being February 

with 4,550 (7.9%). For PE it was January with 4,350 

(9.4%) and April with 3,505 (7.6%), respectively. 

Contacts with either DVT or PE was most likely during 

weekdays, Monday being the higher with 11,096 

(19.2%) for DVT and 8,222 (17.8%) for PE. Weekends 

was least likely with Saturday being the lowest with 

5,085 (8.8%) for DVT and 4,301 (9.3%) for PE. 

Conclusion: Number of patient contacts to Danish 

hospitals in the period of 2005-2016 has been 

decreasing for DVT but increased for PE. We found a 

small variation in contacts with either diagnosis each 

month. For day of contact, the most likely was 

Monday and least likely Saturday.

Diagnoses and mortality for patients with unclear problems calling for an 
ambulance 

Christensen et al. 

Background: 
Danish 

patients 
calling 
the 

Emergency 
Medical 

Services 
(EMS) 
with 

unclear problems are 

assigned a Danish Index 

for Emergency Care (DI) 

criteria called 'unclear problem'. Previous Danish 

studies found 'unclear problem' in 17% and 19% of 

all emergency calls. In the Emergency Departments, 

unclear problems identified as non-specific 

symptoms are well documented. We investigated 

EMS patients given an 'unclear problem' DI-criteria 

prehospitally, their hospital discharge diagnoses and 

1-day and 30-day mortality rates. 

Methods: Population-based observational cohort 

study investigating 7,935 EMS patients who received 

the DI-criteria 'unclear problem' upon an emergency 

call and who were brought to hospital in the North 

Denmark Region during January 1st, 2016 -

December 31st, 2018. Outcome variables were; 

number of emergency ambulances dispatched, 

'unclear problem' DI-criteria, and vital status (dead or 

alive) 30 days after hospital contact. We evaluated the 

association between ICD-10 diagnosis chapters and 

mortality adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity. 

ICD-10 chapters 18: "Symptoms, signs and abnormal 

clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere 

classified" and 21: "Factors influencing health status 

and contact with health services" were defined as 

'non-specific diagnoses'. 

Results: All ICD-10 chapters were represented in the 

discharge diagnoses. The majority (40.4%) were non-

specific diagnoses. Common discharge diagnoses 

were circulatory (9.6%), injuries and poisoning 

(9.4%), and respiratory diseases (6.9%). Overall 

mortality rates were for 1-day and 30-day 2.3% 

(n=181) and 7.1% (n=566), respectively. Day 1 

mortality rates were highest for circulatory diseases 

(8.6%), infections (5.4%), and respiratory diseases 

(4.0%). Mortality on day 30 was 2.6% and 4.1% for 

non-specific diagnoses, whereas circulatory, 

respiratory diagnoses and infections exhibted highest 

mortality rates. Risk of mortality was associated with 

age and comorbidities and when adjusted for these 

confounders, mortality rates decreased for all 

diagnoses. 

Conclusion: EMS patients assigned 'unclear 

problem' and brought to the hospital received 

diagnoses from all ICD-10 chapters, the majority with 

non-specific diagnoses, followed by injuries and 

poisoning, circulatory and respiratory diseases. The 

latter two groups exhibited the highest crude 

mortality rates, decreasing substantially when 

adjusted for age and comorbidity. Mortality rates 

among patients with unclear problems were 

associated with age and comorbidities rather than the 

unclear emergency medical call and following 

discharge diagnoses.

Diphoterine® for chemical burns of the skin; a systematic review 

Dinesen et al. 

Background: 
Chemical 

burns represent a small 

part of burn injuries, but 

the incidence seems to 

increase. Traditionally a 

chemical burn is rinsed 

with water or water and soap. Diphoterine is an 

amphoteric, chelating, polyvalent, slightly hypertonic 

solution made for decontamination of chemical 

splashes proposing one treatment suitable for most 

kinds of chemical burns. Objective: In this systematic 

review we aimed to assess the effect of Diphoterine 

on chemical burns compared with water or no 

treatment. The primary endpoint was depth of burn 

and secondary outcomes included pain, duration of 

hospitalization, time to return to work, need for 

surgery, pH, and complications associated with using 

Diphoterine. 

Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web 

of Science, and Google Scholar were systematically 

searched on March 22, 2021 using the term 

"Diphoterine". Interventional, observational, and 

cohort studies were included. No language 

restrictions were applied. Risk of bias was assessed 

using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool for 

randomized trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 

(NOS 0-9) for non-randomized studies. 

Results: A total of 8 studies were included. Only 1 

retrospective study evaluated the depth of a chemical 

burn and found no difference between the 

Diphoterine group and the control group. Three 

studies reported on pain and found a more 

pronounced decrease in pain when using Diphoterine 

compared to the control groups. Two studies found 

significant improvement of pH when using 

Diphoterine. No studies found a difference in time to 

return to work or duration of hospitalization. No 

studies addressed the need for surgery. No studies 

found any complications associated to the use of 

Diphoterine. Risk of bias was judged high in the 

included RCT and the rest of the studies was 

awarded between 3 and 7 stars on NOS.

Results: Of 73783 EMS patients with hospital contact 

following an 1-1-2 emergency call, 32% (N=24229) 

were assigned a non-specific diagnosis upon 

discharge. Median age 56.0 years (32.7;73.1), 48.9% 

were female and 65.7% had no comorbidity (CCI=0), 

25.9% had moderate (CCI= 1-2) and 8.4% had high 

comorbidity (CCI: 3-). Mortality within 30 days was 

2.9% and 2095 patients had a renewed contact. Of 

these, 59.8% received a specific ICD-10 diagnosis; 

circulatory (17.5%), injury/poisoning (12.0%), 

mental/behavioral (11.1%), respiratory (8.2%) and 

digestive diseases (6.2%). In renewed contacts, 

patients with different diagnoses had more than a 

twofold increase in 30-day mortality (adjusted RR 

(95%CI)): 2.52 (1.27-4.98), higher mean age (58.3 vs. 

circulatory 
diseases, 
injury/poisoning 
and 

mental/behavioral disorders. Most emergency 

ambulance patients with non-specific diagnoses had 

low mortality and no renewed contact, however 5% 

had potentially serious underlying conditions and 

high mortality.

participation, 
however 

emergency medicine is 

work experience (years). DOW was categorized as 

DOW1 (DOW=1-3), DOW2 (DOW=4-6) and DOW3 

(DOW=7-10). The agreement between patients' 3-

level DOW and nurses' estimation of patients' 3-level 

DOW was assessed with equal weighted Cohen's 

Kappa. Additional kappa values stratified on patient's 

gender, age, co-morbidity and nurses' gender, age 

and seniority are also estimated. 

Results: The difference between patients' 3-level 

DOW and nurses' estimation was in total agreement 

in n=58 pairs (29.9%) of the ratings. For n=136 

patient/nurse-pairs there was not agreement 

between scores, which corresponds to a weighted 

Cohen's Kappa of 0.19 (0.30;0.08, p<0.001). Similar 

kappa values were found in analyses stratified for 

age, gender, nurse seniority. 

Conclusion: The agreement between patients' 3-

level DOW and nurses' estimation of patients' 3-level 

DOW is low and suggests that nurses do not know 

their patients' worries. This should be addressed in 

further research, as well as, clinical work.

Furthermore, the HaH CST assists NOH's E.D. and the municipality by taking care of issues that can be handled effectively at the patient's home.Facilitation of evidence based discussions in an Emergency Department Methods: Each day a nurse from the ED decided a topic for discussion. A clinical nurse specialist and a Conclusion: In conclusion, 10 professional minutes facilitate a better understanding and an increased focus of evidence-based work by use of EBP. It creates a room for nursing-related discussion and reflection to the nurses daily work. Further research is suggested to focus on implementation, where EBP will be an integrated part of the nurses daily work. among the ambulance-patient population in the North Denmark Region in 2020 compared to previous years.Conclusion: In conclusion, the negative DID 

coefficient found shows a drop of 2 contacts per day 

between 11pm and 7am. This drop in utilization of 

EDs could indicate an inequality in accessibility to 

healthcare. This begs the question; which citizens 

does not utilize the EDs after reconfiguration, and 

what conquests this brings?

Schmidt et al. 

Background: With an 

increasing-
and 
an 

increasingly 
aging 

population, the elderly 

morbidity 
burden 
is 

growing. This raises the 

question of how we can 

effectively respond to this health-care challenge in a 

hospital setting where more patients are both old and 

comorbid. Consequently, North Zealand Hospital's 

(NOH's) Emergency Department (E.D.) has launched 

a pilot project that explores the value of having a 

cross-sectoral team (CST) to specifically manage old 

(65+ y.o.), complexly ill, and vulnerable patients on a 

hospital-at-home (HaH) basis. The purpose of this 

study was to classify and categorize the CST's elderly 

HAH patients (not formally discharged from NOH's 

E.D. but receive home visits by the E.D.'s HaH 

nurses). 

Methods: Data regarding the HaH CST-patients at 

NOH were prospectively gathered during February 

2021. Microsoft Excel software was then used to 

categorize and analyze the data. Numeric data are 

given as means ± SEM. 

Results: There were 227 HaH CST-interventions. Of 

these, 186 (81.9%) were elderly patients. The number 

of unique HaH elderly CST-patients (uHaHe-CSTps) 

was 108 (56 male and 52 female) aged 81 ± 0.8 years. 

The uHaHe-CSTps were categorized into age groups 

as following: 10 (65-69 y.o.), 18 (70-70 y.o.), 20 (75-

79 y.o.), 17 (80-84 y.o.), 27 (85-89 y.o.), 13 (90-94 

y.o.), 3 (95-97 y.o.). Of the uHaHe-CSTps, 93% were 

multimorbid, 82% had polypharmacy, 33.3% were 

readmitted patients within 2 weeks after ended HaH 

CST-intervention, and 4.6% died while in HaH CST-

care.

Background: 
Evidence 

based practice (EBP) is a 

way for the nursing 

discipline to minimize the 

gap between theory and 

practice. EBP is based on 

decision-making and is used to optimize patient 

outcomes and optimize clinical practice. To 

strengthen the nurses focus on EBP at the 

Emergency Department (ED), we introduced 10 

minutes of professional nursing related discussion 

daily. A staff nurse and a clinical nurse specialist 

facilitated it and used EBP as a tool. The objective of 

this study aims to investigate if facilitation of "10 

professional minutes" could strengthen the nurses 

focus on evidence and their practical skills using EBP 

as a tool. 

staff nurse facilitated the discussion by using a flip-

over to illustrate the topic in the EBP model. To 

evaluate the project, a questionnaire containing 11 

questions was distributed to all nurses at the ED 

(n=116) after 4½ month. Two focus group interview 

were performed to supplement the survey. 

Results: The questionnaire had a response rate of 

72%. 61% of the nurses answered that "10 

professional minutes" had influenced their nursing 

practice. 54% gained an increased focus on 

guidelines and search for evidence. 54% found the 

EBP model contributed to a better understanding of 

working evidence based. 66% found that 10 

professional minutes created a room for nursing-

related discussion. From the focus group interviews 

with respectively employees and leaders, three 

identical themes emerged; "Framework with 10 

professional minutes creates a culture for discussion 

about nursing", "The EBP model increase focus on 

evidence and nuances in nurses practical skills" and 

"10 professional minutes creates space for nursing-

related discussion and reflection in daily work".

Fewer emergency ambulances during the Covid-19-pandemic in North 
Denmark Region, a cohort study 

Lindskou et al. 

Background: The Covid-

19 pandemic have led to 

decreases in hospital 

admissions during the first 

period in the spring 2020, 

also among acute patients. 

However, it is not known if 

the pandemic had any influence on the most severely 

acutely ill and injured, that is patients calling the 

emergency number and requesting an ambulance. 

Prehospital data, both logistic and medical journals, 

are present in all of Denmark's five health care 

regions, as are in-hospital data. The aim was to study 

hospital diagnoses and 1-and 30-days mortality 

Methods: This is a regional pilot study in preparation 

of a nationwide study, designed as a population 

based historic cohort study of patients calling the 

emergency number in North Denmark Region in 2020 

compared to the years 2017-2019. Prehospital data 

were linked with patient administrative data on 

hospital diagnoses (ICD-10) and date of death. 

Outcomes 
were 
prevalence 
and 
mortality. 

Proportions were estimated using Poisson regression 

and proportions were compared by relative risks (RR) 

with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 

Results: Compared with 2017-19, there were 6.5 % 

(95%CI 3.6;9.2) fewer patients in 2020. The 

proportion of hospitalizes patients increased 1% (RR 

1.01, 95%CI 1.01;1.02), whereas patients not brought 

to a hospital decreased 5% (RR 0.95, 95%CI 

0.92;0.97). Proportion of patients with respiratory 

diseases was reduced, from mean 2042/year to 1479 

in 2020 (RR 0.76, 95%CI: 0.72;081), particularly 

during the first period of the Covid-19 pandemic in 

March-June. There was no difference for other major 

diagnoses, such as cardiovascular disease with mean 

3046/year versus 3083 in 2020. There was no 

difference in over-all 1 and 1-30-day mortality in 2020 

compared to 2017-19, neither for patients with nor 

without hospital contact, and no difference in 

mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. 

Conclusion: In the North Denmark Region the overall 

number of emergency calls decreased during the 

Covid-19 pandemic. Respiratory diseases decreased 

markedly by 24% in 2020. Opposed to other studies 

we found no difference for cardiovascular diseases.

Reorganisation of emergency departments: From policy to practice announced in Denmark. To obtain the expected benefits of the policy, the policy must be put into practice. The aim of this study is to assess the relation between policy and practice after this policy announcement.Methods:The study was designed as a crosssectional study and we conducted a survey across all Danish emergency departments (n=21), to assess the policy implementation from 2007-2017. The questionnaire was answered by executive staff at the EDs (100% response rate). We applied the multicontingency theory as an analytical framework to classify policy recommendations (specialised equipment, centralisation, multidisciplinary teams, staff, incentive structure) known to affect patient outcome. The framework further guides our analysis and expectations of the policy implementation process and ED impact.Results: The implementation rate varied across organisational dimensions: Coordination (multidisciplinary teams, triage, flow coordinator) was first implemented and terminated at the highest rates from 86-100%, whereas the implementation of structure (specialised equipment and centralisation) and staff (senior physicians and qualification upgrade) were more sluggish with implementations rates from 10-76% and 33-90%, respectively. The policy did not adhere to the multi-contingency theory and strategy and incentive structure were identified as missing organisational design dimensions of the policy. Conclusion: We found hesitant and heterogeneous translation from policy to practice, probably due to cooperation and recruitment challenges. According to our analytical framework, these issues might be caused by a lack of linkage between policy and theory. However, most of the Danish EDs developed new coordination strategies to resolve these issues. Since the policy did not suggest a complete design plan, it is not surprising, that the EDs have tried to develop independent solutions. It also shows that if only a partial design is specified with no time limits, the implementation may take different routes.

SI) has been found to be useful in the recognition of hemorrhage but no definite threshold for predicting mortality has been determined. Our aim was to determine whether a SI ≥ 1 in adult trauma patients was associated with increased in-hospital mortality compared to a SI < 1. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library were searched using controlled vocabulary, and retrospective observational studies were included. Studies were included if they reported in-hospital mortality in trauma patients aged ≥ 16 years, with a measurement of SI from the emergency department or trauma center, dividing patients in groups of SI ≥ 1 and SI < 1. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the strength and quality of the body of evidence was assessed according to GRADE. Data was pooled using a random effects model. Results: We screened 1239 citations with an interrater reliability (Cohen's kappa) of 0.90 (95% CI 0.88-0.93). Thirteen comparative cohort studies including 639210 patients were included. All studies reported a significant higher in-hospital mortality in adult trauma patients with a SI ≥ 1 compared to those having a SI < 1 at first assessment in the emergency department or trauma center.

BIBLIOTEK FOR DANSK TIDSSKRIFT FOR AKUTMEDICIN 25 af 26 Work environment in emergency medicine needs to be improved Schmidt et al. Background: Emergency medicine (EM) is a novel specialty in Denmark. So far there are only 111 board certified specialists in EM in Denmark ~5 per Emergency department (ED). We hypothesize that stressful ED work environment may impact EM recruitment. The aim of our analysis was to evaluate the rate of applicants for EM junior and senior residency and relate it to ED patient complaint rate and work environment. Methods: We evaluated EM junior residency applications; and we calculated the rate of unfilled versus posted EM senior residency appointments In Denmark in 2020. As received by The Danish Agency for Patient Complaints we compared complaints from patients received over a 3-year period for EM, Respiratory medicine (RM), Cardiology (Card) and2022 Vol. 1

appointments in Denmark amounted to 31 out of 52 posted appointments, meaning that 59% of EM senior residency appointments were unfilled. Patient complaints amounted to (means±SEM) EM 333±55; RM 88±9; Card 113±17; Endo 58±8, meaning a 3 to 5fold higher patient complaint rate in EM (p < 0.0006). There were no statistical differences in patient complaints among RM, Card and Endo. Among 8 EM junior residents 63% expressed interest in an EM career as the reason for their application but following EM experience none intended to apply for senior residency. Conclusion: More than half of posted senior residency positions in EM remain vacant. Patient complaints are significantly frequent in EM compared to other medical specialties. Junior residents are reluctant to pursue senior residency. Stressful ED working environment needs to be improved to facilitate EM recruitment.Conversely
