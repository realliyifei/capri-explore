It is caused by infection with various species of trypanosome that are continent, south of the Sahara desert. It is caused by infection with various species of trypanosome that are transmitted to the host through the bite of an infected vector, the tsetse fl y. Efforts to control the disease have transmitted to the host through the bite of an infected vector, the tsetse fl y. Efforts to control the disease have involved attempts to reduce the vector population by use of traps, insecticide application, the sterile male involved attempts to reduce the vector population by use of traps, insecticide application, the sterile male technique as well as treatment and prophylaxis of overt cases with chemotherapeutic drugs, consisting mainly technique as well as treatment and prophylaxis of overt cases with chemotherapeutic drugs, consisting mainly of isometamidium, homidium, quinapyramine and diminazene. These drugs have been in use for over 50 years of isometamidium, homidium, quinapyramine and diminazene. These drugs have been in use for over 50 years and are associated with severe toxicity and parasite resistance. Over the years, efforts in several laboratories and are associated with severe toxicity and parasite resistance. Over the years, efforts in several laboratories to formulate new treatment profi les through pharmacokinetic studies of the trypanocides, combination to formulate new treatment profi les through pharmacokinetic studies of the trypanocides, combination therapy, use of medicinal plants and application of antioxidants, have not succeeded in eradicating the threat therapy, use of medicinal plants and application of antioxidants, have not succeeded in eradicating the threat of the disease. The development of an effective vaccine has also not been successful due to the antigenic of the disease. The development of an effective vaccine has also not been successful due to the antigenic variation of the trypanosome surface coat, a condition that has stifl ed progress, if not totally halted vaccine variation of the trypanosome surface coat, a condition that has stifl ed progress, if not totally halted vaccine development. However, more recent studies suggest the trypanosomal microtubulin could be a viable antigen development. However, more recent studies suggest the trypanosomal microtubulin could be a viable antigen for vaccine development. This review focuses on measures that have been undertaken to control Animal African for vaccine development. This review focuses on measures that have been undertaken to control Animal African Trypanosomosis by chemotherapy, and discusses future measures and prospects since the measures adopted so Trypanosomosis by chemotherapy, and discusses future measures and prospects since the measures adopted so far have not successfully controlled the disease. far have not successfully controlled the disease.

Numerous methods of control have been developed, yet the disease has . Numerous methods of control have been developed, yet the disease has K. I. Eghianruwa et al.: Chemotherapeutic control of trypanosomosis -a review of past measures, current status and future trends proved very diffi cult to eradicate. Ironically, trypanosomes were among the fi rst organisms proved very diffi cult to eradicate. Ironically, trypanosomes were among the fi rst organisms to be targeted by synthetic drugs. Paul Ehrlich, 'the father of chemotherapy', chose these to be targeted by synthetic drugs. Paul Ehrlich, 'the father of chemotherapy', chose these organisms as a model on which to test his ideas . Chemotherapy has organisms as a model on which to test his ideas . Chemotherapy has been a major component in the control of trypanosomosis but no new trypanocide has been a major component in the control of trypanosomosis but no new trypanocide has been introduced into the fi eld since the early 1960s (ONYIAH, 1997). This is partly been introduced into the fi eld since the early 1960s (ONYIAH, 1997). This is partly because of the prohibitive cost of discovering, developing and introducing new drugs because of the prohibitive cost of discovering, developing and introducing new drugs onto the market ; LINARES et al onto the market LINARES et al., ., 2006). For instance, in 1975For instance, in , 2006. For instance, in 1975, the $1 billion spent on drug research and development in the USA yielded only seven the $1 billion spent on drug research and development in the USA yielded only seven drug entities, in sharp contrast to the situation in the 1950s in which about forty new drug entities, in sharp contrast to the situation in the 1950s in which about forty new drug entities were introduced yearly, with a total annual research and expenditure of drug entities were introduced yearly, with a total annual research and expenditure of less than $100 million (TROUILLER and OLLIARO, 1999). This situation is partly due less than $100 million (TROUILLER and OLLIARO, 1999). This situation is partly due to the scope of testing required by the regulatory bodies, with the consequent increase to the scope of testing required by the regulatory bodies, with the consequent increase in expenditure. The huge capital required by the developed economies to develop new in expenditure. The huge capital required by the developed economies to develop new trypanocides is regarded as hardly worth it because the political and economic situations trypanocides is regarded as hardly worth it because the political and economic situations in the countries where trypanocides are required are not encouraging (MURGOLO et in the countries where trypanocides are required are not encouraging (MURGOLO et al., 1989;GEERTS et al., 2001).

Absorption of diminazene aceturate through the oral route has been recorded in some animal species, including rats (RAETHER et al., oral route has been recorded in some animal species, including rats (RAETHER et al., 1974;KELLNER et al., 1985) and monkeys (RAETHER et al., 1974(RAETHER et al., ). 1974KELLNER et al., 1985) and monkeys (RAETHER et al., 1974).

It was observed that DMA (3.5 mg/kg) administered intravenously to mongrel It was observed that DMA (3.5 mg/kg) administered intravenously to mongrel dogs after infection with dogs after infection with T. congolense T. congolense was rapidly distributed in the body. However, was rapidly distributed in the body. However, the infection had no marked infl uence on the urinary excretion of the drug, whereas the infection had no marked infl uence on the urinary excretion of the drug, whereas intravenous administration of DMA 3.5 mg/kg in intravenous administration of DMA 3.5 mg/kg in T. b. brucei T. b. brucei infected mongrel dogs infected mongrel dogs signifi cantly altered the kinetic disposition of DMA (ONYEYILI and ANIKA, 1989). signifi cantly altered the kinetic disposition of DMA (ONYEYILI and ANIKA, 1989). The distribution half-life of the drug was markedly decreased and there was a prolonged The distribution half-life of the drug was markedly decreased and there was a prolonged elimination half-life, with a decreased total body clearance in the infected animals. These elimination half-life, with a decreased total body clearance in the infected animals. These observations were attributed to the pathological changes in the cardiovascular system observations were attributed to the pathological changes in the cardiovascular system induced by trypanosomal infection. The tissue distribution and residue profi le of DMA induced by trypanosomal infection. The tissue distribution and residue profi le of DMA (3.5 mg/kg) was also investigated in healthy dogs, and in dogs infected with (3.5 mg/kg) was also investigated in healthy dogs, and in dogs infected with T. congolense T. congolense and and T. b. brucei T. b. brucei treated intramuscularly (ONYEYILI and ANIKA, 1991). Diminazene treated intramuscularly (ONYEYILI and ANIKA, 1991). Diminazene was observed to be distributed to various organs and tissues of the body, with the highest was observed to be distributed to various organs and tissues of the body, with the highest concentrations occurring in the liver and kidneys. Higher drug levels were found in the concentrations occurring in the liver and kidneys. Higher drug levels were found in the tissues of healthy dogs when compared with those of trypanosome infected animals, tissues of healthy dogs when compared with those of trypanosome infected animals, except in the brain. Drug residues were still detectable in the tissues of the animals 10 except in the brain. Drug residues were still detectable in the tissues of the animals 10 days after drug administration (ONYEYILI and ANIKA, 1991). days after drug administration (ONYEYILI and ANIKA, 1991).

In another study, the effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ) on the tissue distribution of In another study, the effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ) on the tissue distribution of DMA was also investigated in rabbits. There was a delay in the attainment of peak DMA was also investigated in rabbits. There was a delay in the attainment of peak concentration in the rabbits treated with DMA (7mg/kg, intramuscular) and CPZ (5mg/kg, concentration in the rabbits treated with DMA (7mg/kg, intramuscular) and CPZ (5mg/kg, intramuscular). High levels of DMA occurred in the brain of rabbits given a combination intramuscular). High levels of DMA occurred in the brain of rabbits given a combination of CPZ and DMA compared to the level obtained in the rabbits given DMA alone. This of CPZ and DMA compared to the level obtained in the rabbits given DMA alone. This indicates the greater penetration of DMA into the central nervous system of the rabbits indicates the greater penetration of DMA into the central nervous system of the rabbits that received a combination of CPZ and DMA (ONYEYILI et al that received a combination of CPZ and DMA (ONYEYILI et al. ., 1992).

With regards to isometamidium (ISMD), BRAIDE and EGHIANRUWA (1980) With regards to isometamidium (ISMD), BRAIDE and EGHIANRUWA (1980) reported that drug levels were detected in goat plasma 24 hours after intramuscular reported that drug levels were detected in goat plasma 24 hours after intramuscular injection, but not after intravenous injection. These authors attributed this observation to its injection, but not after intravenous injection. These authors attributed this observation to its rapid distribution from the systemic circulation. ISMD concentrations were also detected rapid distribution from the systemic circulation. ISMD concentrations were also detected in appreciable levels in the liver and kidneys, 12 weeks after intravenous administration. in appreciable levels in the liver and kidneys, 12 weeks after intravenous administration. No drug concentration was detected in the muscles, except at the intramuscular site of No drug concentration was detected in the muscles, except at the intramuscular site of injection. The authors attributed the prophylactic action of the drug to this intramuscular injection. The authors attributed the prophylactic action of the drug to this intramuscular depot, which becomes limited following encapsulation resulting from local tissue depot, which becomes limited following encapsulation resulting from local tissue reaction (ALIU and CHINEME, 1980). As a result of the known tissue reaction of ISMD reaction (ALIU and CHINEME, 1980). As a result of the known tissue reaction of ISMD K. I. Eghianruwa et al.: Chemotherapeutic control of trypanosomosis -a review of past measures, current status and future trends at the intramuscular site of injection, OGUN and EGHIANRUWA, (1993) evaluated at the intramuscular site of injection, OGUN and EGHIANRUWA, (1993) evaluated the absorption rate of ISMD from the stomach and intestine of rats, and reported that the absorption rate of ISMD from the stomach and intestine of rats, and reported that ISMD was appreciably absorbed from the stomach and not from the intestine. In a ISMD was appreciably absorbed from the stomach and not from the intestine. In a comparative effi cacy study of ISMD following intramuscular and oral administrations, comparative effi cacy study of ISMD following intramuscular and oral administrations, the intramuscular route was found to be clearly superior (EGHIANRUWA et al., 2004). the intramuscular route was found to be clearly superior (EGHIANRUWA et al., 2004).


## Complexation of trypanocides Complexation of trypanocides

Complexes of ISMD with adjuvants have also been produced to alter the kinetic profi le Complexes of ISMD with adjuvants have also been produced to alter the kinetic profi le of ISMD. Studies involving the Isometamidium-dextran complex and isometamidium-of ISMD.

## The use of a sanative pair The use of a sanative pair

This concept, which was fi rst suggested by WHITESIDE (1962), prescribes the This concept, which was fi rst suggested by WHITESIDE (1962), prescribes the sequential use of a pair of chemically unrelated trypanocides (e.g. Berenil and Homidium). sequential use of a pair of chemically unrelated trypanocides (e.g. Berenil and Homidium). The concept entails the use of one of the sanative pair until resistant strains of trypanosomes The concept entails the use of one of the sanative pair until resistant strains of trypanosomes appear, following which the second is substituted and used until the resistant strains have appear, following which the second is substituted and used until the resistant strains have disappeared from cattle and tsetse. A modifi ed version of this concept ultimately became disappeared from cattle and tsetse. A modifi ed version of this concept ultimately became the trypanosomosis drug policy of the then Northern Region of Nigeria. The drug policy the trypanosomosis drug policy of the then Northern Region of Nigeria. The drug policy prescribed that each of the two curative drugs be used for six months of the year when a prescribed that each of the two curative drugs be used for six months of the year when a species of trypanosomes sensitive to the drug was predominant (ILEMOBADE, 1979). species of trypanosomes sensitive to the drug was predominant (ILEMOBADE, 1979 For example, For example, T. vivax T. vivax was found to be generally susceptible to homidium compounds was found to be generally susceptible to homidium compounds and was the predominant species in cattle when they were withdrawn to the wet-season and was the predominant species in cattle when they were withdrawn to the wet-season grazing areas; whereas grazing areas; whereas T. congolense T. congolense was generally susceptible to berenil and was the was generally susceptible to berenil and was the predominant species in cattle during the dry season when cattle were moved to pastureland predominant species in cattle during the dry season when cattle were moved to pastureland in the tsetse belts of the south.

## Hyperosmolar agents and relapse infections Hyperosmolar agents and relapse infections

Poor drug distribution to infected tissues, particularly the brain, is one of the host Poor drug distribution to infected tissues, particularly the brain, is one of the host related factors associated with relapse of trypanosomosis infection (JENNINGS et al. related factors associated with relapse of trypanosomosis infection (JENNINGS et al., , 1979). Diminazene aceturate, the routine drug for treating trypanosomosis in Nigeria, has 1979). Diminazene aceturate, the routine drug for treating trypanosomosis in Nigeria, has small molecular size but its charged nature prevents easy passage across the blood-brain-small molecular size but its charged nature prevents easy passage across the blood-brainbarrier (BBB), with the result that in cerebral trypanosomosis, the trypanosomes evade barrier (BBB), with the result that in cerebral trypanosomosis, the trypanosomes evade its trypanocidal action. In order to overcome this failure to reach the required therapeutic its trypanocidal action. In order to overcome this failure to reach the required therapeutic concentrations at the parasite location in the brain, hyperosmolar agents such as lithium concentrations at the parasite location in the brain, hyperosmolar agents such as lithium chloride (LiCl) and sucrose were used in combination with trypanocides, to achieve the chloride (LiCl) and sucrose were used in combination with trypanocides, to achieve the osmotic opening of the BBB and the resultant effective chemotherapy. Lithium chloride osmotic opening of the BBB and the resultant effective chemotherapy. Lithium chloride and sucrose are known to effectively open the BBB (SPATZ et al and sucrose are known to effectively open the BBB (SPATZ et al. ., 1976).

## Combination therapy Combination therapy

It has been suggested that the low effi cacy of trypanocides may result from under-dosing, It has been suggested that the low effi cacy of trypanocides may result from under-dosing, poor drug quality, rapid-infection with short-acting therapeutic agents (such as DMA) and poor drug quality, rapid-infection with short-acting therapeutic agents (such as DMA) and drug resistance. To exclude the possibilities of under-dosing and poor drug quality, samples of drug resistance. To exclude the possibilities of under-dosing and poor drug quality, samples of DMA and isomethamedium chloride obtained locally were analyzed, and the results showed DMA and isomethamedium chloride obtained locally were analyzed, and the results showed that the qualities were of acceptable standards. This result thus suggested the existence of that the qualities were of acceptable standards. This result thus suggested the existence of genuine drug resistance in the fi eld (ANENE et al genuine drug resistance in the fi eld (ANENE et al. ., 1996(ANENE et al. ., ). , 1996. In order to address the problem of drug resistance, a study was conducted In order to address the problem of drug resistance, a study was conducted in vitro in vitro to assess to assess the ability of calcium antagonists of several chemical classes (verapamil, cyproheptadine, the ability of calcium antagonists of several chemical classes (verapamil, cyproheptadine, desipramine and chlorpromazine) to reverse resistance of desipramine and chlorpromazine) to reverse resistance of Trypanosoma evansi Trypanosoma evansi to a range to a range of trypanocides including DMA, suramin and MelCy. The putative resistance modulators of trypanocides including DMA, suramin and MelCy. The putative resistance modulators were intrinsically antitrypanosomal, but were unable to reverse resistance to any of the were intrinsically antitrypanosomal, but were unable to reverse resistance to any of the trypanocides tested (ANENE et al trypanocides tested (ANENE et al. ., 1996).

One of the most signifi cant problems faced in controlling the spread of trypanosomosis One of the most signifi cant problems faced in controlling the spread of trypanosomosis is that there is little economic incentive to conduct research in these impoverished parts of is that there is little economic incentive to conduct research in these impoverished parts of the world that are endemic to the disease, and it is diffi cult to get expensive drugs to the the world that are endemic to the disease, and it is diffi cult to get expensive drugs to the people. The drug discovery scenario, however, is changing dramatically. Several potential people. The drug discovery scenario, however, is changing dramatically. Several potential drug targets and molecules have been recognized. drug targets and molecules have been recognized.

One of the drug targets identifi ed so far is related to an unusual enzyme, Trypanosome One of the drug targets identifi ed so far is related to an unusual enzyme, Trypanosome Alternative Oxidase (TAO) which Alternative Oxidase (TAO) which T. brucei T. brucei uses in glycolysis. This enzyme is the uses in glycolysis. This enzyme is the terminal oxidase of the respiratory chain of long slender bloodstream forms of the African terminal oxidase of the respiratory chain of long slender bloodstream forms of the African trypanosome, and it is absent from the host (NIHEI et al., 2002;CHAUDHURI et al., trypanosome, and it is absent from the host (NIHEI et al., 2002;CHAUDHURI et al., 2006). The amino acid sequence of TAO in HAT-causing trypanosomes was observed 2006). The amino acid sequence of TAO in HAT-causing trypanosomes was observed to be identical to that in non-human infective to be identical to that in non-human infective T. b. brucei T. b. brucei (NAKAMURA et al., 2010).

However, the procyclic forms, which are the fi rst (TAYLOR and RUDENKO, 2006). However, the procyclic forms, which are the fi rst life-cycle stage to develop in the tsetse fl y, replace the VSG coat by procyclins that do not life-cycle stage to develop in the tsetse fl y, replace the VSG coat by procyclins that do not protect the parasite from lysis by serum components. This process of differentiation from protect the parasite from lysis by serum components. This process of differentiation from bloodstream to procyclic forms is specifi c to the parasite and has been exploited by some bloodstream to procyclic forms is specifi c to the parasite and has been exploited by some workers to screen for potential drug candidates (WENZLER et al., 2016). workers to screen for potential drug candidates (WENZLER et al., 2016).

The prospects for exploiting differences between parasite and mammalian protein The prospects for exploiting differences between parasite and mammalian protein kinases to develop new trypanocides have been reported (NAULA et al., 2005). Protein kinases to develop new trypanocides have been reported (NAULA et al., 2005). Protein kinase regulates many different cellular processes, such as transcriptional control, cell kinase regulates many different cellular processes, such as transcriptional control, cell cycle progression and differentiation (WIESE et al., 2003;ELLIS et al., 2004) and its cycle progression and differentiation (WIESE et al., 2003;ELLIS et al., 2004) and its potential as drug targets is not restricted to trypanosomosis but also to a wide range of potential as drug targets is not restricted to trypanosomosis but also to a wide range of diseases and syndromes, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease diseases and syndromes, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease (SEBOLT-LEOPOLD and HERRARA, 2004;NAULA et al., 2005;STRUMBERG and (SEBOLT-LEOPOLD and HERRARA, 2004;NAULA et al., 2005;.

## Improved drug delivery to target sites in the parasite Improved drug delivery to target sites in the parasite

Drug resistance and the low therapeutic index of available trypanocides have been Drug resistance and the low therapeutic index of available trypanocides have been some of the limiting factors to the effective control of trypanosomosis by chemotherapy some of the limiting factors to the effective control of trypanosomosis by chemotherapy (DELESPAUX and De KONING, 2007). One mechanism by which trypanosomes (DELESPAUX and De KONING, 2007). One mechanism by which trypanosomes develop resistance is by alteration of the nucleoside transporter system associated develop resistance is by alteration of the nucleoside transporter system associated with the movement of drug molecules to target sites within the parasite (SHIFERAW with the movement of drug molecules to target sites within the parasite (SHIFERAW et al., 2015). Resistant populations of trypanosomes are known to take and accumulate et al., 2015). Resistant populations of trypanosomes are known to take and accumulate less trypanocides than sensitive ones ; MULUGETA less trypanocides than sensitive ones MULUGETA et al., 1997). While the search for new drugs is ongoing, efforts to develop new drug et al., 1997). While the search for new drugs is ongoing, efforts to develop new drug formulations, that would improve drug delivery to target sites within the parasite with formulations, that would improve drug delivery to target sites within the parasite with consequent increases in effi cacy and safety, are equally being pursued. Studies are consequent increases in effi cacy and safety, are equally being pursued.

Ascofuranone, a et al., 2009;OMOJA et al., 2011;MANN and OGBADOYI, 2012). Ascofuranone, a prenylated phenol antibiotic and a structural analog of coenzyme Q isolated from a prenylated phenol antibiotic and a structural analog of coenzyme Q isolated from a phytopathogenic fungus, phytopathogenic fungus, Ascochyta visiae Ascochyta visiae, resulted in 100% cure of mice infected with , resulted in 100% cure of mice infected with T. b. brucei T. b. brucei when given by intraperitoneal route in combination with glycerol. The when given by intraperitoneal route in combination with glycerol. The compound was reported to be highly non-toxic compound was reported to be highly non-toxic in vivo in vivo and able to cross the blood-brain and able to cross the blood-brain barrier (MINAGAWA et al., 1997;YABU et al., 2003YABU et al., , 2006. Similarly, a fraction of the barrier (MINAGAWA et al., 1997;YABU et al., 2003YABU et al., , 2006. Similarly, a fraction of the oily extract from garlic bulbs cured mice infected with oily extract from garlic bulbs cured mice infected with T. b. brucei T. b. brucei in four days, when in four days, when given intraperitoneally at a dose of 120 mg kg given intraperitoneally at a dose of 120 mg kg -1 -1 per day (NOK et al., 1996).

per day (NOK et al., 1996). Thorough understanding of the mode of action of the pharmacologically active Thorough understanding of the mode of action of the pharmacologically active principles in natural products is still lacking. However, possible mechanisms have been principles in natural products is still lacking. However, possible mechanisms have been suggested in some cases. For instance, NOK et al. (1996), attributed the action of the oily suggested in some cases. For instance, NOK et al. (1996), attributed the action of the oily extract from garlic bulbs to its interference with the parasites' synthesis of membrane extract from garlic bulbs to its interference with the parasites' synthesis of membrane lipids. Similarly, the mechanism of the action of ascofuranone, a structural analog of lipids. Similarly, the mechanism of the action of ascofuranone, a structural analog of coenzyme Q, is attributed to its binding at the coenzyme Q site of ubiquinol oxidase, thus coenzyme Q, is attributed to its binding at the coenzyme Q site of ubiquinol oxidase, thus blocking trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO), one of the two enzymes associated blocking trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO), one of the two enzymes associated with a unique mitochondrial electron transport system in with a unique mitochondrial electron transport system in T. b. brucei T. b. brucei bloodstream forms. bloodstream forms. Glycerol suppresses the second enzyme, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, by mass Glycerol suppresses the second enzyme, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, by mass action. Hence, it has been observed that inhibitors of TAO become trypanocidal when action. Hence, it has been observed that inhibitors of TAO become trypanocidal when combined with glycerol, due to the total block of the energy production of bloodstream combined with glycerol, due to the total block of the energy production of bloodstream forms (NIHEI et al., 2002). forms (NIHEI et al., 2002).

## Vaccine production Vaccine production

Success has not been forthcoming in the production of vaccines against trypanosomosis. Success has not been forthcoming in the production of vaccines against trypanosomosis. Studies have shown that bloodstream forms of trypanosomes circumvent the host immune Studies have shown that bloodstream forms of trypanosomes circumvent the host immune response by continuous changes to surface glycoprotein, hence continuous changes in response by continuous changes to surface glycoprotein, hence continuous changes in antigenicity. The variable surface glycoproteins (VSGs) are antigenically distinct due antigenicity. The variable surface glycoproteins (VSGs) are antigenically distinct due to extensive differences in the primary sequences (TAYLOR and RUDENKO, 2006; to extensive differences in the primary sequences (TAYLOR and RUDENKO, 2006;. Antigenic variation of the parasite has been seen as one of the RUDENKO, 2011). Antigenic variation of the parasite has been seen as one of the K. I.

The trypanosome has therefore been credited as the ultimate immune destroyer and The trypanosome has therefore been credited as the ultimate immune destroyer and escape artist (La GRECA and MAGEZ, 2011). A review of the various attempts made escape artist (La GRECA and MAGEZ, 2011). A review of the various attempts made to vaccinate both domestic livestock and laboratory animals showed from the reported to vaccinate both domestic livestock and laboratory animals showed from the reported studies that complete protection was readily achieved only if the same variable antigen studies that complete protection was readily achieved only if the same variable antigen type (VAT) was used for immunization and challenge (GRAY, 1976;MURRAY et al., type (VAT) was used for immunization and challenge (GRAY, 1976;MURRAY et al., 1979;. When a distant VAT was used for challenge, no protection 1979;. When a distant VAT was used for challenge, no protection occurred. Following these observations, many researchers in the area of trypanosomosis occurred. Following these observations, many researchers in the area of trypanosomosis control have assumed that an effective vaccine would have to contain all VATS, possibly control have assumed that an effective vaccine would have to contain all VATS, possibly an insurmountable task as the number of VATS is likely to be large. Hence many consider an insurmountable task as the number of VATS is likely to be large. Hence many consider the possibility of vaccination to be remote. the possibility of vaccination to be remote. Although this view has been widely held and propagated, some workers have shown that Although this view has been widely held and propagated, some workers have shown that failure to achieve effective vaccination to control trypanosomosis is due to factors other than failure to achieve effective vaccination to control trypanosomosis is due to factors other than antigenic variation WEI et al antigenic variation (WEI and TABEL, 2008;WEI et al. ., 2011;TABEL et al , 2011;TABEL et al. ., 2013). Studies , 2013). Studies have shown that antibodies to the VSG are required for the control of African trypanosomes have shown that antibodies to the VSG are required for the control of African trypanosomes infecting the blood, whereas infections of the skin by low numbers of trypanosomes are infecting the blood, whereas infections of the skin by low numbers of trypanosomes are controlled by innate resistance and do not require antibodies for their control. Low numbers controlled by innate resistance and do not require antibodies for their control. Low numbers of trypanosomes infecting the skin, although killed by innate resistance, do not induce of trypanosomes infecting the skin, although killed by innate resistance, do not induce protection, but enhance susceptibility to re-infections due to suppression of the innate protection, but enhance susceptibility to re-infections due to suppression of the innate resistance by adaptive immune responses (MANSFIELD and PAULNOCK, 2005; WEI and resistance by adaptive immune responses (MANSFIELD and PAULNOCK, 2005;WEI and TABEL, 2008;WEI et al., 2011;WEI et al., 2011;TABEL et al. ., 2013). These workers concluded that immune , 2013). These workers concluded that immune suppression, which is one of the cardinal effects of Trypanosomosis, is responsible for vaccine suppression, which is one of the cardinal effects of Trypanosomosis, is responsible for vaccine failure. DARJI et al. (1992) proposed that immune suppression is attributed to the coexistence failure. DARJI et al. (1992) proposed that immune suppression is attributed to the coexistence of at least two unlinked suppressive mechanisms that block different T-cell regulatory steps of at least two unlinked suppressive mechanisms that block different T-cell regulatory steps and operate through different effector mechanisms, and the authors linked these mechanisms and operate through different effector mechanisms, and the authors linked these mechanisms to the generation of prostaglandin-producing macrophages which are entirely responsible for to the generation of prostaglandin-producing macrophages which are entirely responsible for the suppression of IL-2 production, whereas the induction of a prostaglandin-independent the suppression of IL-2 production, whereas the induction of a prostaglandin-independent suppressive mechanism accounts for the suppression of the expression of IL-2 receptors (IL-suppressive mechanism accounts for the suppression of the expression of IL-2 receptors (IL-2R). This point of view had been expressed by other workers (SILEGHEM et al 2R). This point of view had been expressed by other workers (SILEGHEM et al. ., 1989;SCHLEIFER and MANSFIELD, 1993). Following the results of their studies, TABEL et al SCHLEIFER and MANSFIELD, 1993). Following the results of their studies, TABEL et al. . (2013) concluded that any attempt to produce an effective vaccine should fi rst address the (2013) concluded that any attempt to produce an effective vaccine should fi rst address the problem of induction of immunosuppression by the trypanosomes. problem of induction of immunosuppression by the trypanosomes.

Continued efforts to develop effective vaccines have resulted in studies of other non-Continued efforts to develop effective vaccines have resulted in studies of other nonvariable molecules in the trypanosome. African trypanosomes express numerous non-variable molecules in the trypanosome. African trypanosomes express numerous nonvariable antigens (LUBEGA et al., 2002;RASOOLY and BALABAN, 2004;LI et al., variable antigens (LUBEGA et al., 2002;RASOOLY and BALABAN, 2004;LI et al., 2009).

## Conclusion Conclusion

If trypanosomosis must be controlled relatively cheaply, vaccination still remains If trypanosomosis must be controlled relatively cheaply, vaccination still remains the best theoretical option. This is particularly expedient considering the fact that the best theoretical option. This is particularly expedient considering the fact that trypanosomosis affects poor economies and the cost of developing new effective drugs trypanosomosis affects poor economies and the cost of developing new effective drugs is exorbitant. There is little doubt that the introduction of an effective vaccine, if used is exorbitant. There is little doubt that the introduction of an effective vaccine, if used strategically, along with improved treatment methods and tsetse control measures, would strategically, along with improved treatment methods and tsetse control measures, would make an enormous contribution to the control of African trypanosomosis. This would make an enormous contribution to the control of African trypanosomosis. This would be followed by increased human productivity and livestock production in endemic be followed by increased human productivity and livestock production in endemic trypanosome areas of the African continent. trypanosome areas of the African continent.
