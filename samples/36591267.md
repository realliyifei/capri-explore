Background : Epilepsy is often associated with discrediting representations even in the developed countries. The prevalence of disease is 3-5 in thousand. Purpose : Our purpose was to assess social and cultural representation of epilepsy in the elderly in two French departments (Haute-Vienne and Creuse). Methods: An analysis of the answers given by  in Creuse) persons aged 65 and more, selected with the method of quota, during a face to face interview using a questionnaire which explores the representations of epilepsy. The interview was done in 2003 during the local step of an international multi centric community survey entitled "Mental disorders: Image and Realities in community sample". Results : Beliefs in supernatural causes of epilepsy, witchcraft, curse and punishment are more important in elderly aged 65 and more prevalent compared to the younger subjects; it's the opposite for social causes (conflicts, bereavements, stress). The alimentary interdictions are also persistent. Medical assistance keep a good place in the knowledge of the therapy of epilepsy. It showed that those aged 65 and more in Haute-Vienne had social and cultural representation of epilepsy, generally more pessimistic than those of the persons aged less than 65. Conclusion: The study confirmed a decrease in the stigma about epilepsy. This data suggest a better consideration of the social and cultural representations in the fight against epilepsy even in western countries.KEY WORDSElderly Social and cultural representation Epilepsy Community surveyCorresponding Author P Nubukpo, Ph.D

Currently, The subjects included were questioned using a questionnaire beliefs in magical, supernatural causes, contagion or heredity of (see table2) on the representations related to the epilepsy the disease are a barrier in the global care of People with epilepsy 2,3 prepared by the Institute of tropical neurology and neurological (PWE) especially in SSA.

The interview was done in 2003 during was 21.1% (280 people over 1807). This subclass accounted for the local step of an international multi centric community survey almost 1/5 of the total population.
