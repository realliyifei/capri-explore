We report results of a search for CIII] λλ1907,1909Å emission using Keck's MOSFIRE spectrograph in a sample of 7 z phot ∼ 7 − 8 candidates (H ∼ 27) lensed by the Hubble Frontier Field cluster Abell 2744. Earlier work has suggested the promise of using the CIII] doublet for redshift confirmation of galaxies in the reionization era given Lyα (λ1216Å) is likely attenuated by the neutral intergalactic medium. The primary challenge of this approach is the feasibility of locating CIII] emission without advanced knowledge of the spectroscopic redshift. With an integration time of 5 hours in the H-band, we reach a 5σ median flux limit (in between the skylines) of 1.5 × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 but no convincing CIII] emission was found. We also incorporate preliminary measurements from two other CLASH/HFF clusters in which, similarly, no line was detected, but these were observed to lesser depth. Using the known distribution of OH emission and the photometric redshift likelihood distribution of each lensed candidate, we present statistical upper limits on the mean total CIII] rest-frame equivalent width for our z 7 − 8 sample. For a signal/noise ratio of 5, we estimate the typical CIII] doublet rest-frame equivalent width is, with 95% confidence, < 26±5Å. Although consistent with the strength of earlier detections in brighter objects at z 6 − 7, our study illustrates the necessity of studying more luminous or strongly-lensed examples prior to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.

## INTRODUCTION

The reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) represents a key phase in the evolution of the Universe. Observations of high-redshift galaxies, which have charted a marked decline in the visibility of Lyα emission with redshift (Stark et al. 2010;Schenker et al. 2012), and those of z > 5 quasars which trace the redshiftdependent Gunn-Peterson absorption (Fan et al. 2006), indicate that cosmic reionization was largely complete by z ∼ 6. The duration of the reionization process is constrained by the polarization of the microwave background due to Thomson scattering by electrons in the ionized era; recent data from the Planck satellite and results derived from the abundance and luminosity distribution of the z > 6 galaxy population now suggest reionization was a rapid process which extended over 6 < z < 10 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2015;Robertson et al. 2015).

While Lyα emission (λ 1216Å) has proven to be the most valuable spectroscopic indicator for faint starforming galaxies in the redshift range 4 < z < 6 (e.g. Stark et al. 2010Stark et al. , 2011, resonant scattering by neutral gas in the IGM likely renders this line ineffective as a reliable probe beyond z 6.5. Despite much observational effort, there are currently very few convincing cases of detected Lyα emission beyond z 7 (Ono et al. 2012;Finkelstein et al. 2013;Vanzella et al. 2014a;Schenker et al. 2014;Oesch et al. 2015) and several distant starforming galaxies reveal no emission despite heroic expo-  (Vanzella et al. 2014b). As a result, Stark et al. (2014b) proposed it may be feasible to use metallic lines in the ultraviolet (UV) as alternative spectroscopic indicators. Examining the spectra of 17 gravitationallylensed low-luminosity galaxies at z 1.5 − 3, they discuss the feasibility of searching for CIII] (λλ1907,1909 A) and CIV (λλ1548,1550Å) emission. Although such metallic lines are normally much weaker than Lyα in luminous systems, in young metal-poor low luminosity systems characteristic of those at high redshifts these lines may become relatively more prominent. In their sample of 17 z 1.5 − 3 galaxies, Stark et al. (2014b) find CIII] emission has an equivalent width (EW) which correlates with that of Lyα and is typically 10 times weaker. As an encouraging proof of concept, Stark et al. (2014a) recently claimed tentative detections of CIII] emission in two J ∼ 25.2 galaxies with pre-determined Lyα emission at redshifts of z = 6.03 and z = 7.21.

However, as emphasized by Stark and collaborators, detecting CIII] emission in galaxies where its expected wavelength is a priori known from a Lyα redshift is less challenging than searching for emission across a wider range of wavelength governed only by a photometric redshift likelihood distribution, and given the density of skylines. Motivated by the interest in exploring the potential of this, possibly the only, immediate route to spectroscopic progress in the reionization era, we have embarked on a statistical search. Our plan is examine the spectra of a sample of gravitationally-lensed sources in the redshift range z ∼6.7-8.5 derived from recent compilations in several massive clusters (e.g. Bradley et al. 2014;Atek et al. 2014b;Zheng et al. 2014;Coe et al. 2014). Such a statistical approach is now possible due to the arrival of multi-slit near-infrared spectrographs such as Keck's Multi-Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE; McLean et al. 2012). In this paper, we examine the practicality of the method with realistic exposure times for the Frontier Field cluster Abell 2744, and also include preliminary data for two other CLASH/HFF clusters observed to shallower depths.

The paper is organized as follows: In §2 we overview the sample, observations, and data reduction. In §3 we discuss the results, summarized in 4. Throughout the work we use a standard ΛCDM cosmology with (Ω m0 = 0.3, Ω Λ0 = 0.7, H 0 = 100 h km s −1 Mpc −1 , with h = 0.7), and magnitudes are given using the AB convention. Cluster names are abbreviated to "A" or "M" for Abell (e.g. Abell et al. 1989) and MACS (MAssive Cluster Survey; e.g. Ebeling et al. 2010) clusters, respectively, followed by their ID.


## DATA


### Target Selection

We constructed a sample of high-z candidates magnified by the galaxy cluster A2744 using photometry from Hubble Frontier Fields program (Lotz et al. 2014). Candidates for inclusion in our multi-slit mask were derived from Zheng et al. (2014), Coe et al. (2014) and Atek et al. (2014b,a, see also Ishigaki et al. 2014). We pre-selected targets of known magnification down to an apparent magnitude of H 160 ∼ 28 with photometric redshifts in the range 6.7 < z < 8.5, corresponding to the visibility of CIII] within MOSFIRE's H-band filter. We also included the z ∼ 9.8 candidate from Zitrin et al. (2014) to explore the option of detecting the CIV λλ (1548, 1550) A doublet in the same band. This follows a promising detection of CIV emission at z 7.05 by Stark et al. (2015). Photometric redshift likelihood distributions, P (z), were obtained with the Bayesian Photometric Redshift code (BPZ; Benítez et al. 2004;Coe et al. 2006; see also Zheng et al. 2014), covering the full redshift range available to HST (from z = 0.01 to z = 12 in ∆z = 0.001 incre-ments). Due to slit-mask positioning constraints, only a subset of good candidates could be included on the MOS-FIRE mask and priority was given to brighter galaxies. The final mask included 8 high-z candidates as summarized in Table 1. The CIII] candidates lie mainly in the magnitude range 26.2 < H < 27.5 and have photo-z uncertainties of δ z 0.2 − 0.3. The rest-frame UV luminosities corrected for lensing magnifications have a mean of M U V −18.8 and standard deviation of 1.4. As part of this campaign we also have begun observations of two further lensing clusters, MACS0416 and A2261, drawing candidates from the catalogs of Bradley et al. (2014) and Coe et al. (2014, see also McLeod et al. 2014. As the photometric redshift distributions of these galaxies are somewhat less secure (especially for A2261), and since our observations of these clusters are significantly shallower, they currently provide less useful constraints on the presence of CIII], although we incorporate the results in this paper. We also list these additional sources in Table 1. Fig. 1 summarizes the redshift and UV luminosity distribution of the total sample in the context of the H-band window available for detecting CIII] with MOSFIRE.


### Observations and Data Reduction

Observations with MOSFIRE on the Keck 1 telescope were undertaken on 16 September, 25 November, and 27 November 2014. A total exposure of 5 hours was obtained for A2744. Thus far only 2.7 and 2.2 hours have been secured for A2261 and M0416, respectively. Median seeing varied between ∼ 0.5 − 0.8 . Each exposure comprised 120 sec integrations with an AB dithering pattern of ±1.25 along the slit. On each mask, one slit was assigned to an alignment star, in order to track possible positional drifts and transparency changes.

Data reduction was performed using the standard MOSFIRE reduction pipeline 4 . For each flat-fielded slit we extracted the 1D spectrum using a 11 pixel boxcar centered on the expected position of the target. A similar procedure was adopted in quadrature to derive the 1σ error distribution. The addition of data from different nights was performed by inverse-variance averaging the calibrated 1D spectra. To obtain the 1σ flux limits for CIII], we assumed a marginally resolved line width (Stark et al. 2014a) corresponding to three MOSFIRE pixels (∼ 5Å in the H-band) and summing in quadrature the 1D σ spectrum within the 3-pixel window.

Spectrophotometric standard stars were observed twice a night in similarly good conditions. We scaled a Vega model 5 to each standard star to determine a wavelengthdependent flux calibration using the procedure described in Vacca et al. (2003), which more accurately traces telluric corrections free from stellar absorption features. Our various flux calibrations on each night agree to within 15% and are also consistent with the nominal MOSFIRE calibration files (C. Steidel, private communication) to within ∼ 10%. The calibrated spectra of alignment stars (incorporated on our multi-slit mask) from different nights also agree to within 1 − 8%, and are typically within ∼ 20% of the flux level expected from their H 160 photometry, after aperture corrections for slit  losses. Using our adopted calibration, the median 5σ detection limit achieved in between the OH skylines for our A2744 exposure is 1.5 × 10 −18 cgs. This line flux limit is comparable with that achieved by Stark et al. (2014a) using MOSFIRE. In their 3.1 hour exposure, they report a limiting flux (5σ) of 1.8 × 10 −18 cgs.


## RESULTS

All reduced spectra were visually inspected given the expected wavelength range where CIII] might be visible according to the photometric redshift likelihood function. No convincing line was seen for any of the 7 CIII] candidates. We thus seek to determine the likely range of fluxes and equivalent widths (EW) for CIII] consistent with our non-detections 6 . In other words, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one CIII] line in our survey, as a function of a given mean total flux and EW.

Since CIII] is a doublet, we assume a line ratio CIII] 1907/1909Å of 1.4 (Stark et al. 2014a). We consider total line strengths in the range 0 − 4 × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 in 5 × 10 −20 ergs cm −2 sec −1 increments as illus-trated in Fig. 2. For each doublet line, and for each redshift step, we checked if its input flux would exceed a certain detection significance (xσ) in the corresponding wavelength in the observer frame, where x is a chosen signal/noise ratio. For a fixed line flux, the likelihood of having a detection with xσ k significance in the examined slit k is given by the number of spectral pixels with positive detections over the total number of pixels, weighted by the redshift probability function P (z). The relevant expression for slit k can be formulated as:
P det,k (F in , x) = i P k (z i )Θ (F in , x, σ k , z i ) i P k (z i ) ,(1)
where the sum is over all the redshift steps z i (z = 0 to z = 12 in 0.001 increments), and Θ is defined as
Θ (F in , x, σ k , z i ) =    1 if F in > xσ k (1907Å · (1 + z i )) or F in /1.4 > xσ k (1909Å · (1 + z i )) 0
otherwise, and we define σ k = ∞ for z i steps placing the line outside the MOSFIRE H band. P det,k therefore provides a conditional probability, i.e. the chance of detecting at least one of the two CIII] lines for a given target k with redshift probability distribution P k (z), given the limiting noise in our spectra for the mask, σ k (λ) (see §2), and as a function of the input line flux F in and the detection significance x. Finally, the probability of detecting at least one line of a given flux F in over the entire sample is:
P sample (F in , x) = 1 − k (1 − P det,k (F in , x)) ,(2)
where the product is over all slits. We repeat the above process also in terms of restframe EW, where in each iteration, instead of running over a range of input fluxes, we run over a range of restframe EWs, translated in each iteration, for each object individually, to the corresponding input flux. Figure 3 shows the probability, for both 3 and 5 σ detections, of finding at least one line in our A2744 survey as a function of the mean total CIII] flux and restframe EW. For example we have a 95% chance of detecting at least one CIII] line in our MOSFIRE survey at 5σ significance, if the typical CIII] λ1907Å line flux is 1.5 × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 (total doublet flux of 2.6 × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 ), or equivalently, if the rest-frame EW for the combined CIII] doublet is 26 ± 5 A or higher. In this estimate we have included limits from the shallower exposures on A2261 and M0416, but the results remain similar (to within typically 5%) if the sample is restricted to A2744 -for which photometric redshift errors are typically smaller and the observations are significantly deeper. Errors were propagated assuming our adopted 20% uncertainty in the flux calibration.

For comparison, Stark et al. (2014a) detected, with 3.3σ, a λ1909Å CIII] line of 4.2 ± 1.2 × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 (total estimated CIII] flux 1.1 ± 0.3 × 10 −17 ) in a z = 6.03 galaxy (J = 25.2), and a 2.8σ CIII] detection of likely λ1909Å of 0.9 ± 0.3 × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 (total estimated CIII] flux 2.3 ± 0.5 × 10 −18 ) in a z = 7.21 galaxy (J = 25.2). The total CIII] restframe EWs of these detections are 22.5 ± 7.1Å and 7.6 ± 2.8Å respectively.

While our observational limits are deep enough to recover similar line fluxes to those found by Stark et al. (2014a, see also Stark et al. 2014b), our galaxies are fainter (∼ 27 AB), so that our limits on the restframe EWs are less constraining. Assuming a CIII] EW of 22.5(7.6)Å as was found by Stark, we have ∼ 99.9%(10%) chance for detecting at least one such line in our sample with 3σ, or ∼ 90%(0%) for 5σ. Thus, it is quite likely that the primary reason for the non-detection in our survey is that, on average, the present sample is significantly fainter than those targeted by Stark et al., which also had the benefit of secure Lyα-based redshifts. The main conclusion of our limits seen in Figures  3 and 4 is that even with a more ambitious spectroscopic campaign that would likely increase the exposure time by a factor ×4 (corresponding to a 3 night integration on one mask), only more luminous z 7-8 galaxies in the reionization era would appear to be amenable for study with any reliability. Alternatively, brighter and/or more highly-magnified examples, such as those close to the critical line of a foreground cluster, might provide promising targets although generally such sources are rare. It is interesting to note the non-detection (and upper limit) on CIII] emission recently claimed by Watson et al. (2015) for a brighter source with H=24.7, magnified by µ ∼ 10 at z=7.5, showing that even for significantly brighter objects CIII] detection can be challenging. Searching for bright magnified dropouts in a very large sample of clusters, for example, is desirable for progress with current facilities and might help deliver JWST with first light targets.

For completeness, we also calculate the limit on the CIV λλ (1548,1550)Å doublet for the z 9.8 multiplyimaged object discovered by Zitrin et al. (2014) behind A2744 (Fig. 3). Stark et al. (2014b) found prominent CIV emission in some of the z ∼ 2 galaxies they targeted, and highlighted CIV as an additional promising diagnostic for high-redshift galaxies. Typically they found CIV line fluxes only a factor of about 2 weaker than those of CIII]. At the proposed redshift of the Zitrin et al. (2014) object, the doublet would be readily resolved and we assume both lines have equal strength. In this case, we determine that, with ∼ 90% confidence, the line flux for either one of the two CIV lines for a detection significance of 5σ is less than 3.6 × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 , and the rest-frame EW less than 32Å. This translates to a magnification-corrected, total CIV luminosity of 3.9 × 10 41 erg sec −1 at z = 9.8. It would be interesting to investigate further the properties of CIV emission in a larger sample. Note also Stark et al. (2015) have now detected a promising a CIV λ1548Å line in a z 7.05 object, corresponding to a restframe EW of 18.1Å (a total CIV restframe EW of 38Å). As in the CIII] case, despite reaching deep enough to detect a similar line flux, 4.1 × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 , in terms of EW the nondetection is consistent with the limits obtained from the single z ∼ 10 object.


## CONCLUSIONS

Given the attenuation of Lyα by neutral gas in the reionization era, the CIII] doublet has been proposed as a promising route toward spectroscopic verification and study of high-redshift candidates (Stark et al. 2014a,b). We report results from a short campaign with Keck/MOSFIRE to assess the prospects of detecting CIII] lines in a sample of faint gravitationally-lensed z ∼ 7 − 8 galaxies where Lyα is not seen and thus the search window in wavelength is much larger than in earlier work. We observed 14 high-z candidates magnified by three galaxy clusters. For our deepest field (A2744, with 7 CIII] candidates), we reached a 5σ(3σ) flux limit of 1.5(0.9) × 10 −18 ergs cm −2 sec −1 but did not detect any convincing line. Using a statistical method employing data from our collective campaign, we provide upper limits on the typical CIII] line flux and its rest-frame EW. Although our limits reach the line fluxes observed in some actual CIII] detections claimed in the recent literature, because our sample is significantly fainter in apparent magnitude, we only marginally reach the expected EWs based on these recent detections. This demonstrates the challenge of continuing the present investigation with current observing facilities unless either (i) brighter or more strongly-lensed sources are targeted and/or (ii) the CIII] is found to be more prominent in intrinsicallyfainter systems (e.g. Stark et al. 2014b). More data is needed to test this latter suggestion.

In red we show the 3σ line flux limit, and the dashed blue and purple horizontal lines show fiducial input CIII] line fluxes. For each such iteration we measure the fraction (in wavelength) in which the input flux is higher than the observational limit, weighted by the photometric redshift distribution. This indicates the chance of seeing CIII], as elaborated in §3.

Column 7: UV-slope, β (1σ errors), calculated by a weighted least-squares fit. Column 8: Absolute magnitude, MUV , at λ = 1500Å, calculated from the said F λ ∝ λ β fit, where the error includes in quadrature the discrepancy from the absolute magnitude obtained by translating the flux in the WFC3 band containing the redshifted λ = 1500Å, and the propagated photometric and magnification errors. Column 1: Dropout's ID and references. The first work cited for each object represents the original source of photometric data and analysis, although in some cases we made adjustments to enhance consistency across the sample. et al.
