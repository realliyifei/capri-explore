A Review of the Comparative Bacteriology of Hevea Latex and Its Commercial Derivatives
Received for publication April 16, 1957


Over the past half century the importance of bacteria in affecting the properties of Hevea latex has become increasingly apparent. Many of the early workers were familiar with a wide range of microorganisms responsible for spoilage of latex, ammoniated field latex, ammoniated latex concentrate, and a number of rubber products such as smoked sheet, airdried sheet, and crepe. This work was followed by a search for specific bacteria with the underlying thought or implication that one species might be responsible for dominant changes and that a specific bactericide for this contaminant would be a complete preservative for Hevea latex. The author views this second phase as unfortunate. There is much evidence, ranging from natural coagulation and putrefaction to the spotting of crepe and the manufacture of bubbly sheet, which suggests that a variety of organisms are responsible for latex spoilage. More important, the addition of almost any bactericide at low concentration brings evidence of the growth of resistant strains; this is particularly true of the antibiotics. These general arguments were substantiated by the work of Mrs. H. M. Overton. at the Rubber Research Institute of Malaya. Using frozen latex serum agar (Overton, 1953), she was able to isolate a wide range of organisms, with members of the genera Bacterium (Ehrenberg), Micrococcus (Cohn), Serratia (Bizio), Bacillus (Cohn), and of the coli-aerogenes group being abundantly evident. This work was extended by the author using a similar medium. However, it was difficult to assess the general implication of these results to wider areas (Taysum, 1956a). An attempt was made, therefore, to design a synthetic medium capable of satisfying the seemingly fastidious demands of latex microflora. The final design bore a fairly close resemblance to Kligler's iron agar medium. At the same time, it was shown that a wide variety of latex bacteria capable of growth from single cells on this medium were incapable of similar growth on a number of simple media, such as nutrient agar.

Using modified Kligler's iron agar, supplemented by studies on frozen latex serum agar and sheet-and skimserum agars (Taysum, 1956b), it was possible to isolate some 1000 strains of bacteria from Hevea latex systems.

It is the aim of this report to provide a list of the species identified.


## MATERIALS AND METHODS

In general, the procedure has been to culture bacteria from latex at various stages in its manufacture. Bacteria have been isolated from the following sources:

(1) The tree (Hevea brasiliensis), using various techniques ranging from the provision of sterile tapping knife, sterile chute, and sterile collecting vessel to the grossly contaminated system of normal field practice.

(2) The tapper's collecting bucket, immediately after collection and again after transport to the factory.

(3) The bulk factory ammoniating tank and the storage tank for ammoniated field latex (approximately 0.3 per cent w/w ammonia>.

(4) Concentrated latex and "skim" immediately after centrifuging (no further addition of ammonia).

(5) Concentrated latex immediately after the further addition of ammonia (to about the 0.7 per cent w/w level), in the first storage tank, in the factory bulking tank, and in the road or rail tanker before transport to the shore installation.

(6) Ammoniated concentrate in road or rail tanker on arrival at the shore installation, (that is, after diffusion of contaminating bacteria and their growth or death in the incubated system; the tankers stand for hours in direct tropical sunlight), from the shore installation tank, from the ship's tank on departure, from the ship's tank on arrival at port of destination, and from the shore installation tank at the destination port.

It is not out of place to indicate the comparative ease with which a large collection of species may be accumulated. Figure 1 shows the result of one of the simplest possible experiments in which the bacteria are isolated from the latex of a single tree taken into a sterile container; a sterile tapping knife but normal (dirty) chute are used. It is evident that a population of about ten million bacteria per ml is present. The colonies were fully apparent after incubation for 18 hr although the photograph was taken after incubation for 3 days, to improve contrast. From these plates, 12 different species were isolated. Figure 2 shows the bacteria from the latex in the tapper's bucket; gas-producing species are evident. Figure 3 is of the widely differing bacterial population of fully ammoniated latex concentrate. The plates in figures 2 and 3 are after incubation for 5 days. 349 The organisms are classified using the keys of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, Breed et al. (1948). It has been based upon morphologic studies using phase contrast, interference, and fluorescence microscopy, and on biochemical studies using 14 to 20 carbohydrates and a variety of protein sources. Gram stains and flagellar stains were employed routinely but spore stains were resorted to only when the interference methods gave reason for doubt. It is believed that in most cases the details of classification have exceeded that of the published literature but, where doubt remains, this has been clearly indicated. In general, there are two aspects of doubt: doubt that the organism is the one named (there being no reasonable doubt of the organism being a regular latex contaminant; this is indicated by an interrogation mark after the name of the organism), and doubt that the organism has any permanent habitat in latex systems (that it is anything more than a transient passenger). It is thought that these two difficulties have been fully presented in the analysis.

If anything, the list is too conservative because it has avoided the tendency to name new species in an entirely unexplored field. In the family of the Bacillaceae there is, however, good evidence for new species and a number of these have been suggested. Because of continued contact with ammonia over years, many of the bacteria demonstrate remarkable resistance to ammonia and to high pH conditions in general; growth in such systems is the rule rather than the exception. The author has made no distinction between ammoniaresistant strains and similar bacteria from neutral sources; there is much evidence to support the view that this resistance has been bred.


## RESULTS

Below are listed the species isolated from Hevea latex systems in a study lasting some 4 years and involving the isolation of about 1000 strains. For fresh latex, the extent of the study has been limited mainly to the State of Selangor; for ammoniated field latex, the area covered is virtually the Federation of Malaya, samples having been taken from Kedah (within sight of the Siam border) to Johore; for ammoniated concentrate, the scale of operation is sensibly unlimited and Figure 1.

Inocula: (upper left) 1 ml X 10-1; (upper right) 1 ml X 102; (center) 1 ml X 10-; (lower left) 1 ml X 10-; (lower right) 1 ml X 10-5. in these tests extended as far as the installation tank at the port of destination.

Family Nitrobacteriaceae. The existence of these two species reflects the frequency with which latex is inoculated with soil (table 1).

Family Pseudomonadaceae. This family is very widely distributed in Malayan waters and, hence, in fresh Figure 2. A single plate (inoculum 1 ml X 10-6) derived from latex in the tapper's bucket, at the factory. latex; the species grow readily on serum agar on which the members of the genus Pseudomonas produce a striking ultraviolet fluorescence. The numbers occurring are never large. Their occurrence again reflects the gross contamination of latex by soil and water under normal field conditions (table 2).

Family Azotobacteriaceae. The occurrence of the species again indicates soil inocula (table 3).

All the species of tables 1-3 have little or no resistance to ammonia; their occurrence in ammoniated systems is often transient and short lived. It should be emphasized, however, that death of an organism on ammoniation still leaves the latex system with the enzymic complement of that organism. Although inhibited by the high pH system and the high ammonia concentration, the activity of these enzymes may be considerable when measured over months.

Family Micrococcaceae. This extremely important family occurs widely in fresh latex. The individual species frequently show a preference for high pH conditions and are widespread in ammoniated latex concentrate. The pigmentation is often great and the organisms form a closely homogeneous group (table 4).

Family Lactobacteriaceae. A pH decrement of 1.9 (7.8 to 5.9) is that required for yellowing of the modified Kligler's iron agar medium; organisms that give this color change are designated "strong acid-producing Figure 3. The bacterial population of fully ammoniated latex concentrate (NH3 1.86 w/w, on the water phase). Inocula: Top (left) 5 ml; (center) 2 ml; (right) 1 ml; Bottom (left) 1 ml X 10-1; (center) 1 ml X 10-2; (right) 1 ml X 10-3.   (table 5). The group as a whole survives ammoniation up to 0.8 per cent on the water phase and represents the dominant population of ammoniated field latices; thus up to 97 per cent of the population of ammoniated field latex may belong to this family. The family as a whole is detected fairly well by the volatile fatty acid test (Philpott and Sekar, 1953) although members of Lactobacillus are not. Survival in fully ammoniated latex concentrate is commonly found under present-day conditions; this position could be radically altered by an improvement in factory hygiene. Also within this family fall the "minute streptococci" of the Lancefield groups F and G. These organisms are difficult to classify and little is known of their metabolism. They are strong acid-producers on the modified Kligler's iron agar, although the acid production per colony is small. Family Corynebacteriaceae. Table 6. Family Achromobacteriaceae. Table 7. Family Enterobacteriaceae. This group of closely related organisms is of widespread occurrence; in fresh latex they predominate at early times and they survive 0.3 per cent ammoniation to a marked extent. Permanent survival in ammoniated concentrate is rare. (table 8).

The Salmonella and Shigella. At least three species of Salmonella are commonly present in latex; inasmuch as no antigenic analysis has been performed, the naming of species is best delayed.

A similar position must be taken with regard to the genus Shigella where evidence for two species is forthcoming.

Family Bacteriaceae. Widely distributed, often in  


## DISCUSSION

It is evident that an amount approaching 100 species are present in these latices. It is also evident that many of these species become important under individual ecologic conditions. The phenomena of symbiosis and antibiosis are frequently encountered. No individual

The chief characteristic of this study is the diversity of the infection; it seems unlikely that any highly specific bactericide acting at very low concentration (of the order of a few parts per million) will be found for latex. Progress will be through broad spectrum antibacterial agents acting at fairly high concentrations. Mixtures of bactericides will probably be required to avoid adaptation in an industry where economic and political conditions combine to make exact supervision exceedingly difficult. In the classification itself there are obvious difficul-   There are at least five species existing in the genus Bacillus which are characterised by long rod-shaped cells and markedly wrinkled colonies, their common habitat is fully ammoniated latex concentrate. It is not clear whether these properties are truly representative of a given original type species; while the properties are maintained on subculture, they might still represent some permanent mutation to an L-form, this mutation having been induced by the abnormal conditions of growth in this highly inhibitory system. For this reason, no attempt has been made here to name new species. Despite these difficulties, which are largely intrinsic to taxonomic studies in general, the over-all picture is clear and represents a sound basis for further developments. The first of these must be towards general hygiene; a departure from the present insanitary conditions obtaining in the more remote areas. GENERAL DESCRIPTION Nearly all nonionic surfactants have the ability to solubilize some iodine, the more efficient ones taking up to 25 to 28 per cent available iodine (table 1). However, mere solubilizing should not be considered to be synonymous with complexing. Pronounced differences are detectable in toxicity, germicidal capacity, iodine vapor pressure of dilute solutions, and other properties.

Of the nonionics, those produced by ethoxylation are more numerous and have received the most attention in surfactant-iodine studies. Surfactant-iodine complexes, however, are not by any means restricted to ethylene oxide condensates or even to nonionics. Anionics and quaternary ammonium compounds can act in a similar capacity. (Cantor et al., 1956;Darragh et al., 1952;Moore and Hardwick, 1956;Rohm and Haas Co., 1954).

In preparing the surfactant-iodine complex, the iodine is generally added to the nonionic surfactant and heated to 130 to 150 F to expedite solution of the iodine and stabilize the end product. The reaction between the iodine and surfactant is exothermic, producing a rise in temperature dependent on the type of surfactant and ratio of surfactant to iodine. If the added iodine does not exceed the solubilizing limit of the surfactant, the end product will be completely and infinitely soluble in water. Such aqueous solutions possess the dark brown to amber color of iodine in water or in tinctures. When applied to the skin or to cotton fabric, there is no stain that cannot be removed with soap and water.

There is a color reaction with starch, although in some cases it is somewhat modified and not always a I Presented in part before the American Chemical Society, Miami, Fla. April 8, 1957. typical starch-iodine blue. The evaporation rate of iodine from dilute aqueous solutions is much slower after complexing with appropriate nonionic surfactants (table 2).

Acute oral toxicity studies, skin irritation and sensitization studies, and eye irritation studies show that this type of germicide is exceptionally safe to warm blooded animals under normal conditions of use (Cantor et al., 1956).

The surfactant-iodine type of germicide is unique in that there is a close relationship between color and antibacterial action. The visible amber color disappears when the titratable iodine drops to about 6 to 8 parts per million. In several standard bacteriological testing procedures which are important for evaluating disinfectants, the end point of the biological test is at approximately the same iodine level. This is in contrast to most other disinfectants or sanitizers that look just the same when freshly diluted for use and after bactericidal capacity is exhausted.

The surfactant-iodine type germicides have very low temperature coefficients and therefore can be used efficiently with either warm or cold water (Cantor and Shelanski, 1951b). COMPOSITION During the process of solubilizing iodine in nonionic surfactants, there is a definite loss of free titratable iodine due to iodination of the surfactant and formation of an acid (possibly HI).

In one experiment, an iodophor was prepared by mixing 90 per cent of a polyethoxy polypropoxy glycol with 10 per cent iodine for 45 min at 150 F. Immediately after preparation, the iodophor contained 7.33 per cent titratable iodine which decreased to 6.5 per cent after storage in a stoppered bottle for 2 weeks at 125 F and

ties. Bacillus polymyxa (Prazmowski) is a very rare 
contaminant mainly of field latex but its precise defini-
tion is open to doubt; a variant of the organism is 
Bacillus pandora (Corbet) one important distinguishing 
criterion being quebrachitol fermentation. The author 
can find no member of the genus Bacillus (Cohn) which 
ferments quebrachitol and which occurs regularly in 
latex systems, hence polymyxa is preferred. Even 
ignoring pandora, the definition of polymyxa implies 
an ability to ferment lactose which is not apparent in 
Hevea latex strains. Further, in the genera of the 
Bacillaceae there is evidence for new species.
