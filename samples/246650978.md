fecundity, survival or recruitment, correspond to those observed in observational studies (2). 48 How to experimentally induce these effects is an entirely separate question governed by 49 logistical practicalities. 50

The principle logistical challenge in experimentally testing the 'ecology of fear' is 51 how to induce enduring (long-lasting) effects on anti-predator behaviour. Time is the unit of 52 measurement of the magnitude of anti-predator responses pertinent to the 'ecology of fear', i.e. 53 the duration of time devoted to anti-predator behaviour rather than foraging, otherwise referred 54 to as the "activity cost" of anti-predator behaviour (2,10,18). Where predators are abundant 55 prey may be forced to devote a substantial portion of each and every day to anti-predator 56 behaviour, representing a substantial 'activity cost', entailing a cumulative interference with 57 foraging over weeks to months likely to reduce fecundity, survival or recruitment (2,10,18). 58 The experimental tests of the 'ecology of fear' conducted to date on free-living wildlife have all 59 accordingly involved manipulations over prolonged periods (2). The prolonged removal of 60 predators to test the 'ecology of fear' has been achieved by maintaining large fenced exclosures 61 over multiple years -at great cost (14,19). Otherwise, the prolonged removal of predators, or 62 prey ('added' predation), has involved prolonged culling (2,20), because translocation is 63 generally logistically infeasible. These constraints are why most experiments to date have 64 'added' predators by simulating their presence (2). 65

Fear is governed by cognitive information-processing in birds and mammals (2,(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9), as 66 emphasized in the above noted new focus on the neurobiological complexities of fear, which 67 recognizes that this cognitive information-processing entails integrating not only immediate 68 experience but learning and memory as well (2,4,5). Information is not a physical substance, protocols exist concerning quantifying fecundity (clutch size) with certainty in song sparrows, 116 which we followed, involving monitoring the time intervals between the laying of each new egg 117 in the nest (37). More challenging was establishing the known-fate survival of eggs and 118 nestlings. As noted in the Main Text, known-fate survival of eggs and nestlings was established 119 with certainty through a combination of, daily nest checks, continuous video surveillance 120 (detailed in 24), and protecting nests from predators of eggs and nestlings. Because even 121 automated monitoring methods are fallible (e.g. due to power failures), protecting nests was 122 designed to augment our certainty by reducing variation due to predation, by eliminating 123 predation by the principal predators of eggs and nestlings, corvids and raccoons, which are 124 known to be respectively responsible for 27 % and 48 % of attacks on song sparrow nests at our 125 study sites (27,28). As noted above, the 'ecology of fear' concerns the behavioural responses of 126 prey to predators caused by the presence of predators and the killing they do (2), and eliminating 127 killing by these predators thus potentially caused us to underestimate the adverse effects of fear, 128 as strongly indicated by the results from a previous experiment on song sparrows at these same 129 sites (27) explained in the Main Text. Establishing the known-fate survival of fledglings was 130 somewhat less challenging because we were able to use radio-telemetry and follow previously 131 published procedures for tracking fledgling survival in song sparrows (38). 132

Confusion has arisen in the literature concerning the 'ecology of fear' as a consequence 133 of it being mistakenly argued that, the effects of direct killing by predators, and the effects of 134 fear, are unrelated and mutually exclusive (2). Experiments on free-living wildlife have clearly 135 demonstrated the demographic impacts that can result from the fear induced in prey which have 136 witnessed their offspring, or their neighbours, being directly killed by predators (2). Conversely, 137 fear may cause some individuals to be more vulnerable to being directly killed by predators. For example, fledglings in our experiment were in no way protected from predators, many were 139 directly killed by predators, and the poorer condition of fledglings in the predator playback 140 treatment may be expected to have made them more vulnerable. Whatever their cause of death, 141 it is solely the fact that fledgling survival was lower in the predator playback treatment that is 142 pertinent to population growth. Knowing the proximate cause of death, i.e., whether individuals 143 are directly killed by predators, is thus not sufficient to determine whether fear affects population 144 growth; what matters is who is killed and when and how this affects the survivors (2). As 145 explained in the Main Text, if the anti-predator responses of parents ensures they survive at the 146 cost of increasing the number of their offspring directly killed by predators, parents can be 147 expected to prioritize their own survival; and so long as sufficient offspring survive to replace 148 these parents when they eventually die, the number of offspring killed by predators may not 149 affect the population growth rate (2,39,40). The sites used in the present experiment were the same sites used in a previous 159 experiment on song sparrows demonstrating that losing a nest to a predator causes breeding 160 females to become more fearful and subsequently lay smaller clutches (2,27), as noted in the Main Text. Moreover, these were also the same sites referred to in the Main Text as the 162 relatively "low predation risk sites" which when contrasted with nearby naturally high predation 163 risk sites provided part of the corroboration that the effect sizes demonstrated in our experiment 164 corresponded to observational studies, which we conducted in years prior to the experiment 165 described herein (37,41). The naturally high predation risk sites were located in urban parks in 166 Victoria, BC, Canada, c. 25 km from the sites shown in Fig. S1. The known relationship 167 between survival (longevity) and song repertoire size in song sparrows (42), used to predict the 168 transgenerational impact of fear on the survival of recruits as adults, was established in a 169 long-term study on another small coastal island 12 km from the sites in Fig. S1. 170

Song sparrows in this area are resident year-round, and pairs (female and male) occupy 171 exclusive territories averaging 0.4 ha (24,43). They build open-cup nests typically in low 172 shrubs, and build a new nest upon each attempt. Egg-laying occurs from April to July, the 173 maximum clutch size is 5 eggs, and incubation lasts 13 days. Mothers alone incubate the eggs, 174 whereas both parents feed nestlings and fledglings (24,37,38,41). Bi-parental care is 175 effectively obligatory, it having been experimentally demonstrated that while females that have 176 lost their mates do continue to attempt to care for their young, very few of these young survive 177 (44). Nestlings normally fledge 12 days after hatching, all parents normally produce two broods, 178 and some may fledge three broods per year (24, 37. 41). After leaving the nest, fledglings are 179 incapable of sustained flight for the first 7 days, and remain completely dependent on their 180 parents for food provisioning for the first 3 weeks (38). 181

The eight predator species whose vocalizations were used in the experiment, were known 182 to attack song sparrow nests at the sites shown in Fig. S1 based on prior use of our continuous 183 video surveillance systems at these sites (24,27,28), or were species seen or heard at these sites (e.g. Cooper's Hawk, Accipiter cooperii) that were known to represent a significant threat to 185 adult sparrows or their nests, based on research elsewhere (45)(46)(47). As already noted, 75 % of 186 recorded predator attacks on nests were by corvids and raccoons, with attacks by Brown-headed 187 Cowbirds (6.3 %) and owls (4.2 %) also being documented (28). Point-count surveys we 188 conducted across the Gulf Islands archipelago estimated the density of corvids at 0.40 per ha, 189 and 1.77 raccoons were detected per km during nighttime shoreline spotlight surveys of the Gulf 190 Islands, which was significantly more than on the adjacent Vancouver Island 'mainland' (28). In 191 addition to occurring in relatively high numbers, raccoons on the Gulf Islands are both diurnally-192 and nocturnally-active, in contrast to being largely nocturnal elsewhere (28). As detailed below, 193 predators were regularly detected during 100 m transects walked every eighth day at each site, 194 providing a relative index of abundance demonstrating that there was no significant difference 195 between predator and non-predator playback sites. 196


## Manipulating Fear using 'Added' Predators (Implementing the Playbacks) 197

The eight species of predators whose vocalizations were employed in the experiment 198 We statistically verified that there were no significant differences in the overall frequency 209 characteristics between the predator and non-predator playlists by conducting paired t-tests of 210 each of four frequency characteristics (peak t 1,7 = 0.38, P = 0.714; maximum t 1,7 = 0.42, 211 P = 0.686; minimum t 1,7 = 0.68, P = 0.511; range t 1,7 = 0.75, P = 0.475; see further details in 24). 212

We used at least two exemplars of every species' vocalizations, and there was no significant 213 treatment difference in the mean number of exemplars per species (predator = 8.9 ± 1.3, 214 non-predator = 7.9 ± 1.3, mean ± SE; F 1,14 = 0.33, P = 0.574). 215

As elucidated above, habituation is the overarching logistical challenge that must be 216 overcome to simulate the presence of 'added' predators over a prolonged period (21)(22)(23)(24). To 217 avoid habituation, in addition to using multiple exemplars from multiple species as just 218 described, we scrambled the order in which vocalizations were broadcast, interspersed periods of 219 silence among the vocalizations both within and between days, and repositioned and reoriented 220 the speakers every eighth day (24). Within a 24 hr. period, broadcasts of vocalizations (average 221 duration 2 min. and 20 sec.) were interspersed with periods of silence (48,49), in a ratio of 1:1. Playbacks were all broadcast using identical speakers, housed in weatherproof boxes that 229 also housed an mp3 player (all identical), hung from trees at about chest height (1.3 m). As 230 already noted, to avoid habituation, speakers were moved to different trees and oriented in 231 different directions every eighth day. Each time this was done, the volume the speakers were 232 broadcasting at (90 dB at 1 m) was checked using a sound pressure level meter, and fixed 100 m 233 transects were walked at each study site recording the number of actual predators seen or heard. 234

We verified that there was no significant treatment difference in the frequency of actual predator 235 detections per site (χ 2 1 = 0.32, P = 0.574) or the number of actual predators seen or heard along a 236 transect (predator = 1.28 ± 0.09, non-predator = 1.21 ± 0.10, mean ± SE; F 1,53 = 0.08, P = 0.583), 237

and that there was no significant treatment difference between sites in nest predation rates in 238 previous years (χ 2 1 = 0.28, P = 0.600; see further details in 24), based on data from a previous 239 study (41). We additionally verified that there were no significant treatment differences in the 240 minimum (predator = 50.0 ± 5.8 m, non-predator = 39.2 ± 4.7, mean ± SE; F 1,102 = 1.13, 241 P = 0.290) or mean (predator = 51.7 ± 5.9 m, non-predator = 51.9 ± 6.1, mean ± SE; 242 F 1,102 < 0.01, P = 0.991) distance between speakers and nests. 243

In the first and second years of the experiment playbacks were begun before first nests 244 were built, whereas in the third year they were begun at hatch. In all cases we were careful to 245 include only females that did not experience nest predation prior to the manipulation, to control 246 for the effect this is known to have on subsequent clutch size (2,27), which we have already 247 described. In all years playbacks ended when the last nestling fledged from a nest. Because 248 playbacks were begun at hatch in the third year, the effects of playback treatment on clutch size 249 and hatching success reported in Table 1 in the Main Text pertain only to the first and second  250 year. Beginning playbacks at hatch in the third year enabled us to verify that the effects on 251 Allen et al., Supplementary Information Appendix -13 of 32 clutch size and hatching success reported in Table 1 were indeed due to playback treatment, and 252 not site effects, because when there were no 'added' predators (i.e., before the playbacks were 253 turned on at hatch) there were no significant differences between the designated predator and 254 non-predator playback sites (Fig. S1)  (B) found only the radio-tag but it, (a) had been chewed (3 % of instances; as described in 52), or 292 (b) displaced to an area impossible for an offspring to get to (i.e., in 2 % of instances we found 293 the tag of a newly fledged offspring off its natal territory and > 10 m in a tree, which would be 294 impossible for an offspring to do in the first week post-fledge; see also 52). In the remaining 5 % of cases, we relocated the radio-tag intact and categorized these dependent offspring as dead 296 because after returning to the territory on three separate occasions, we located the parents and 297 watched them feed offspring for at least one hour per visit, but we never saw them feeding or 298 tending to that individual. We confirmed that right-censoring these 5 % of cases, instead of 299 categorizing them as dead, had no effect on our survival results. In 31 cases, we failed to pick up 300 the signal of an independent offspring at its natal territory which could have been due to 301 dispersal. Consequently, in all cases we intensively searched the entire island on which the 302 offspring was born and relocated 28 (90 %) of these animals and confirmed their fate as 303 described above. We further searched nearby islands (see below) for the remaining three, but we 304 never re-located them, and so we right-censored them on the date at which they were last seen 305 alive. It is unlikely that the unknown fate of these three individuals was due to dispersal because 306 of our exhaustive surveys and knowledge about the dispersal patterns of the offspring on these 307 islands (see below). We had an additional 35 instances in which the fate of dependent offspring 308 was categorized as unknown, typically due to radio malfunction, and these were right-censored. 309


## Exhaustive Intensive Surveys to Re-Sight Recruits and Establish Adult Survival 310

The exhaustive intensive surveys of each small island conducted to quantify the effects of 311 fear on recruitment and adult survival, by re-sighting survivors, are described in detail in the 312 Main Text. Here we describe the reliability of this method based on our experience studying 313 song sparrows on these islands over 15 years. Of the 100-150 colour-banded young per year 314 known to have fledged from the nest (41) over these years, about 10 % were re-sighted the year 315 after they fledged (53). In the pre-breeding surveys conducted the year after each experimental 316

year, and comparable surveys in the dozen years prior to this experiment, there was never an 317 instance where a potential recruit classified as dead (i.e., not seen), was later re-sighted alive during the subsequent breeding season or in subsequent years. With respect to adults, research 319 on breeding dispersal (the annual movement of territorial adults) in song sparrows, conducted by 320 other scientists in the same region, indicates that fewer than half of all adults show any shift in 321 the location of their territories, and of those that do, the distance shifted is very small (39.3 m, 322 about the radius of a territory; 54). Correspondingly, considering 546 adults we have banded 323 over the years, on the islands shown in Fig. S1, we have never re-sighted an adult on an island 324 other than the one it was banded on, and have only re-sighted 2 adults at locations on the same 325 island away from the sites where they were banded. Consequently, adults not re-sighted in our 326 exhaustive intensive surveys were almost certainly dead. 327


## Calculating Offspring Survival from the End of the Breeding Season to Recruitment 328

As described in the Main Text regarding the stage-structured Leslie Matrix models used 329 to calculate the population growth rate (λ) for each treatment, survival from the end of the 330 breeding season to recruitment was determined by dividing the number of directly re-sighted 331 recruits (Table 1) by the calculated number of juveniles at the end of breeding. Table S1 shows 332 the same values as reported in Table 1 


## Transgenerational Impact of Fear on Survival Predicted from Song Repertoire Size 342

Song sparrow songs comprise several highly stereotyped song types, each of which is 343 repeated numerous times before switching to a bout of a different song type (55). Each song 344 type is distinct and readily distinguishable both acoustically and by visual inspection of their 345 spectrograms (42,53,55). The number of song types each individual sings (n = 6-10 in this 346 study; referred to as its song repertoire size) is determined during a critical learning period in the 347

first year of life and never varies thereafter (53,55). Developmental stress impairing, brain 348 development, resulting song learning ability, and consequently song repertoire size, has been 349 experimentally demonstrated in song sparrows and many other songbirds (53,(55)(56)(57). The 350 transgenerational impact of this early permanent handicapping of offspring was documented in 351 free-living song sparrows in a 20-year study on an island 12 km from our study islands (Fig. S1), 352 conducted by a different research group (42). Longevity was significantly reduced in individuals 353 with smaller repertoire sizes, which the authors suggested reflected the life-long consequences of 354 early developmental stress with regards to individual quality in general (42). 355

To determine song repertoire size we recorded 300 or more continuous songs per recruit, 356 using a Marantz PMD661 solid state recorder and Sennheiser ME66 microphone, and then 357 classified these into song types by visual inspection of their spectrograms (42,53,55) 

## Figure
S1 shows the locations of the 11-15 sites distributed among the five small coastal 152 islands, where we conducted our experiment. The number of sites varied between 11 and 15 153 because we added four additional sites in later years. As noted in the Main Text there were 1-4 154 song sparrow territories per site. All of the islands are ecologically similar, with vegetation 155 comprised of relatively-undisturbed coastal Douglas fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii) forest (28). All 156 are part of the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve, and are uninhabited, though day visits and 157 overnight camping in designated areas is permitted. 158


comprised of (in diurnal to nocturnal order): Common Raven (Corvus corax), Northwestern 199 Crow (Corvus caurinus), Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii), Brown-headed Cowbird 200 (Molothrus ater), raccoon (Procyon lotor), Barred Owl (Strix varia), Western Screech-Owl (Otus 201 kennicotti) and Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius arcadius). These were matched with eight 202 non-predator species whose diel activity and vocal characteristics each corresponded with those of 203 one of the predators (e.g. Raven 'caw' and Goose 'honk'; see further details in 24); here listed in 204 the order matching the corresponding predator: Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), Mallard Duck 205 (Anas platyrhynchos), Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus), Rufous Hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus), harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), wood frog (Rana sylvatica), Common Loon (Gavia immer) 207 and Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla). 208

## 5 222 (
222broadcast : silence) during the day and 1:2.3 during the night, the different diurnal and nocturnal 223 ratios reflecting the naturally-occurring difference in the number of diurnal (more) and nocturnal 224 (fewer) vocalizations heard at the sites. Research on songbirds has shown that a period of 96 225 hours of silence largely eliminates habituation to hearing vocalizations (50), so we interspersed 226 4 days of silence between every four days of broadcasting (i.e., vocalizations were broadcast on a 227 4-day-on-4-day-off cycle).


as regards either clutch size (predator = 3.53 ± 0.15, 255 non-predator = 3.45 ± 0.13, mean ± SE; P = 0.660) or percent hatching success (0.88 ± 0.03, 256 0.92 ± 0.028, P = 0.32; 2-factor mixed model ANOVAs with site designation [Fig. S1] and nest 257 number as fixed effects and female identity as a random effect). 258 Establishing the Known-Fate Survival of Eggs and Nestlings 259 For reasons explained above, we undertook to establish the known-fate survival of eggs 260 and nestlings with certainty using a combination of, daily nest checks, continuous video 261 surveillance, and protecting every nest in both treatments from predators of eggs and nestlings. 262 Continuous video surveillance was accomplished using motion-activated, miniature (3.7 cm x 263 8.6 cm) cameras, attached to stakes positioned 25 cm from the edge of the nest, camouflaged 264 with fabric and conifer fronds (24). To protect eggs and nestlings from attacks by corvids, seine 265 netting (Muketsu 210/52 x 3-5/8" x 100 MD; Pacific Net and Twine Ltd., Vancouver, BC, 266 Canada) was typically draped over tepees constructed above the nest, made from available 267 deadfall (24). To protect eggs and nestlings from attacks by raccoons, small electric fences were 268 constructed to completely encircle the nest at a radius of approximately 2 m with three strands of 269 electrified wire located 8, 16, and 24 cm above the ground (24), powered at 2 kV by a portable 270 fence charger (Deter 200; Hallman Fence Systems Inc., Winnipeg, MN, Canada). Continuous 271 video surveillance verified that there was no direct killing of eggs or nestlings by predators. Establishing the Known-Fate Survival of Fledglings 273 As described in the Main Text, the known-fate survival of older offspring was established 274 with certainty by tracking 151 radio-tagged young from fledging to the end of the breeding 275 season (31 August). This was done in the second and third years of the experiment. We tagged 276 one to two nestlings per nest depending on transmitter availability, while maintaining similar 277 sample sizes between treatments; of 131 nestlings radio-tagged while still in the nest, 63 were 278 tagged in the predator playback treatment and 68 in the non-predator treatment. We ensured that 279 the assignment of tags included a mixture of lightweight, middleweight and heavy nestlings, 280 balanced between the two treatments (t 1,129 = 0.85, P = 0.40). In the course of mist-netting 281 fledglings to replace batteries, we opportunistically captured and tagged a further 20 dependent 282 offspring (predator playback treatment n = 6, non-predator n = 14; χ 2 1 = 2.3, P = 0.13), that we 283 included in our survival analyses by left-censoring them (see below), after confirming that their 284 inclusion did not alter our results. 285 All radio-tags (Biotrack, Wareham UK or Advanced Telemetry Systems, MN, USA) 286 weighed < 3 % of the bird's body mass and were fitted with a leg-loop harness (51) and we 287 tracked them with hand-held antennas and receivers (Telonics Inc., Mesa, AZ, USA; Biotracker, 288 Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, ON, Canada). Fate was categorized as alive after locating the 289 signal and confirming the individual's identification from their colour bands. Fate was 290 categorized as dead if we: (A) recovered the body or parts thereof (90 % of 59 instances); or 291


, as regards the number of eggs laid, and egg-, nestling-333 and fledgling survival, and then shows the result of multiplying the number of eggs laid by each 334 successive survival probability, giving the calculated number of juveniles per brood. As noted 335 above, all parents produce two broods. The calculated number of juveniles produced by the 51 336 pairs of predator playback parents is thus 88 (51 pairs x 0.86 juveniles per brood x 2 broods), and 337 the calculated number produced by the 53 pairs of non-predator parents is 193. Dividing the 338 respective calculated number of juveniles by the respective number of directly re-sighted recruits 339 per treatment (15 and 32; Table 1) gives the identical value 0.17 for each treatment (15/88 and 340 32/193), reported in the Main Text regarding survival from the end of breeding to recruitment.


transgenerational impact of fear on the survival of recruits as adults we used data 359 from Reid et al. (42; their Table 5) to derive the equation describing the regression between 360 survival (longevity) and song number (repertoire size), reported in the Main Text: longevity 361 (years) = (song repertoire size x 0.36) + 0.42. that survival was significantly lower in the predator playback treatment than the nonreduced parental provisioning of nestlings, as we previously reported 435 based on results from the first year of the present experiment (24). Parents that heard predators 436 provisioned their offspring significantly less often, and nestling mass was correspondingly 437 significantly less in the predator playback treatment, also as previously reported regarding results 438 from the first year of the experiment (24). Consistent with their being provisioned less often by 439 their parents, nestlings in the predator playback treatment were significantly hungrier, as 440 evidenced by their eating more food when provisioned by us (predator = 2.8 ± 0.09 balls of food 441 eaten, non-predator = 2.6 ± 0.09, mean ± SE; F 1,91 = 4.2, P = 0.043). Being provisioned less 442 often by their parents, and evidently consequently hungrier, nestlings in the predator playback 443 treatment accordingly had significantly less fat (predator = 4.4 ± 0.19 fat score, non-predator 444 = 5.2 ± 0.20; F 1,126 = 7.5, P = 0.007). Fear also significantly reduced parental provisioning of 445 dependent fledglings, as we demonstrated in a separate experiment (59), and in the present 446 experiment, fledglings in the predator playback treatment accordingly had significantly less fat 447 both on the first day after fledging (predator = 4.3 ± 0.25 fat score, non-predator = 5.3 ± 0.23; 448 F 1,107 = 6.4, P = 0.013) and the fourteenth day (predator = 2.8 ± 0.28, non-predator = 4.1 ± 0.24; 449 F 1,82 = 7.2, P = 0.009).

S1Magnitudes of the effects of fear on each of the components of population growth concerning offspring, and the cumulative effect on the number of offspring at each life-history stage, calculated as the percentage reduction demonstrated in the predator playback treatment relative to the non-predator (control) treatment. The values shown for each population growth component are the same as those reported in Table 1 in the Main Text. The numbers of nestlings, fledglings and juveniles were each calculated by multiplying the number of offspring at the start of the previous life-history stage by the survival during that stage (e.g. Nestlings at hatch = Eggs laid x Egg survival). *See Main Text for definitions.

Quantifying Offspring Hunger and Fat Levels 363Hunger, fat levels and mass were all quantified in six-day-old nestlings, and fat levels 364were quantified in dependent fledglings on the first and fourteenth day after fledging. Whereas 365 mass was measured in all 3 years of the experiment we began quantifying hunger and fat levels 366in year 2 and did so again in year 3. We evaluated hunger levels by hand-feeding nestlings after 367 processing them (colour-banding, etc.) just before placing them back into the nest. The food 368 consisted of moistened egg biscuit (Living World Egg Biscuit, Rolf C. Hagen Inc., Baie d'Urfé, 369 QC, Canada) rolled into a standard sized ball, 1 cm in diameter; and we estimated hunger level 370 on a scale from 0 (no food accepted) to three (three standardized balls accepted). To score fat 371 levels we used a method previously shown to reflect fear effects on adult condition in song 372 sparrows(27); following the descriptions therein to score furculum deposits on a 0 to 7 scale, 373 and abdominal deposits on a 0 to 3 scale, and summing the two scores. Mass was measured to 374 0.01 g using an electronic balance (Model PPS200; Pesola AG, Switzerland). Fat score and mass 375 were correlated, considering all nestlings taken together (Spearman rank correlation: r = 0.35, 376 P < 0.001), corroborating that, as in adult song sparrows(27), fat score provided a 377 readily-interpretable measure of condition. 378Nestling hunger and fat levels were analyzed using 3-factor general linear mixed-model 379ANOVAs (GLMMs). The independent variables were playback treatment, year, and nest 380 number (one or two), with parental identity as a random effect. Fledgling fat levels were 381 analyzed with independent variables playback treatment, year, and parental identity as a random 382 effect. In the aforementioned experiment on adults demonstrating a significant fear effect on fat 383 levels, the effect on mass was not significant(27). With respect to nestling mass, we previously 384 reported that fear affected nestling mass in the first year of the present experiment, based on an 385 Allen et al., Supplementary Information Appendix -19 of 32 ANCOVA which included brood size as both a linear and quadratic covariate(24). The 386 quadratic term was necessary in this previously reported analysis because broods of four 387 generally included a noticeably smaller and lighter nestling. Smaller and lighter nestlings need 388 not necessarily have lower fat scores and we accordingly found in the analyses reported here that 389 including brood size as a covariate was unnecessary when analyzing fat scores. Given the results 390 regarding adults(27), and more straightforward analyses required regarding nestlings, fat score 391 appears to provide both a readily-interpretable and more reliable measure of condition. 392General Statistical Notes 393For all parametric comparisons we tested for assumptions of normality and homogeneity 394 of variances. For survival analyses, all Cox Proportional Hazards models were verified to meet 395 the assumption of proportional hazards for all independent variables (following 58). As noted in 396 the Main Text and above (lines 159-161), results from a previous experiment we conducted on 397 song sparrows on these islands demonstrated that an individual's prior experience of fear affects 398 its subsequent reproduction(2,27). Consequently, our own data demonstrated that it was 399 essential to include parental identity in analyses of fear effects on reproduction, and accordingly 400 all of the analyses of fecundity and offspring survival were conducted "with parental identity 401 included as a random effect", as described in the Main Text. Also as described in the Main Text, 402 adult survival was analyzed "with identity included as a random effect to account for individuals 403 re-sighted in more than two years". In contrast, multiple lines of direct empirical evidence 404 concerning song sparrows on these islands all indicated that there was no reason to expect that 405 'site' (the 15 study sites shown inFig. S1) explained any meaningful amount of variation. As 406 detailed above, there were no significant differences between sites in predator detection 407 frequency or predator number, and no significant differences in nest predation (lines 235-240); 408 Allen et al.,Supplementary Information Appendix -20 of 32we explicitly tested for and determined that site did not explain any significant variation in clutch 409 size or hatching success (lines 251-258); based on our previous survey of the Gulf Islands there 410 was no noteworthy variation in predator density among the study islands(28; lines 186-193); and 411 the islands (and sites) were all comprised of relatively homogenous habitat and subject to 412 uniformly minimum human use or disturbance(lines 155-158). Nonetheless, to be completely 413 certain site was irrelevant we included it as a random effect in preliminary analyses of all 414 models. As expected, site never contributed significantly to any model and removing it made no 415 difference to the results. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute 416Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS 24. 417Supplementary Results and Discussion 418Fear significantly reduced (iii) the proportion of fledglings surviving as juveniles at the 419 end of the breeding season(Fig. 1A,Table 1; Table S1), which as noted in the Main Text, 420 primarily resulted from an impact on fledgling survival in the first 7 days following fledging 421(Fig. S2), when fledglings are still dependent on parental provisioning(38,59). Mortality in the 422 predator playback treatment was twice that in the non-predator treatment (25 % vs. 12 %) during 423 this first 7 days following fledging. As noted above, offspring remain completely dependent on 424 their parents for food provisioning for the first 3 weeks following fledging(38,59), and these 425 first 3 weeks were clearly the most perilous as 73 % of the total number of mortalities between 426 fledging and the end of breeding occurred during this period (both treatments combined). 427Mortalities in the predator playback treatment continued to exceed those in the non-predator 428 treatment in weeks 2 and 3 following fledging (4 % vs. 3 %, week 2; 13 % vs. 10 %, week 3), 429 but considering each week separately, it was only in the first week following fledging, when 430 fledglings are both completely dependent on their parents and incapable of sustained flight(38),
