Desulfurization of organosulfur substrates is highly important due to its relation with the industrial hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process of fossil fuels, which helps to eliminate the sulfur-containing impurities such as thiols, sulfide, thiophenes, etc. from crude oil for the production of easily processed and more cleanly combusted fuel with very low sulfur content.While the HDS process involves a hydrogenolysis reaction under a high pressure of hydrogen gas at high temperature, the hydrolysis of C−S bonds of organosulfur substrates at ambient conditions may very well be considered as a potential alternative for model desulfurization reactions.However, unlike the availability of an appreciable number of reports on base, acid, and metal ion mediated hydrolysis of thioesters in the literature, reports on the hydrolysis of more difficult substrates such as thiolates, sulfides, and other organosulfur substrates remained unavailable until 2017.The very recent discovery of a transition metal mediated hydrolysis reaction of C−S bonds at ambient conditions, however, has rapidly filled in this gap within the past few years.Development of this new stoichiometric reaction allowed the desulfurization of a large number of organosulfur substrates, including aliphatic and aromatic thiols, thiocarboxylic acids, sulfides, disulfides, thiophenes, and dibenzothiophene, at ambient conditions and was subsequently converted to a catalytic process for the hydrolysis of thiols.A brief overview of this new reaction strategy, a proposed reaction mechanism, a critical analysis of the efficiency, and future prospects are presented.

## INTRODUCTION

Transition metal mediated hydrolysis of C−S bonds of organosulfur substrates is highly important from an industrial point of view as well as from a bioinorganic perspective.Regarding the industrial relevance, the cleavage of C−S bonds is related to the industrial hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process of fossil fuels, 1−5 which removes the sulfur-containing impurities, such as thiols and thiophenes, from the crude oil and provides access to more readily processed and more cleanly combusted hydrocarbon products.The HDS process uses a molybdenum-based catalyst in the presence of a cobaltbased cocatalyst and operates at 160−600 psi pressure of H 2 and 300−450 °C temperature.The HDS process is a crucial step in the hydrotreatment of oils and helps to reduce the sulfur content of oils from 1−5% to 0.003−0.04%.Lowering the sulfur content of oil ultimately helps to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions from automotive vehicles, aircraft, railroad locomotives, ships, and various other forms of fuel combustion.Moreover, organosulfur compounds, if present even in trace amounts, may act as a poison for noble metal (Pt, Re) catalysts which are commonly used in petroleum refineries to catalytically reform petroleum naphtha by upgrading its octane rating.Thus, the hydrodesulfurization process also helps to protect such noble metal catalysts from poisoning. 6ypical sulfur-containing impurities present in different refinery products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, refinery fuel oil etc. are thiols, sulfides, disulfides, thiophenes and its derivatives, benzothiophene, dibenzothiophene, napthothiophene, benzonapthothiophene, and ≥3-ring polycyclic sulfur-containing species. 5,6−9 In the HDS process, the sulfur-containing impurities (such as RSH) present in the crude oil are converted to hydrocarbons (RH) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S).The H 2 S thus generated is removed by its absorption in lean amine which is further accompanied by an amine treating unit. 10The simplest mechanism for the HDS reaction may be considered as the direct hydrodesulfurization, which involves the substitution of a sulfur atom by a hydrogen atom in the hydrocarbon structure.This mechanism favors the hydrogenolysis reaction by the direct cleavage of C−S bonds, which may proceed without the hydrogenation of any carbon− carbon double bonds that may be present within the hydrocarbon structure.While several mechanisms (e.g., hydrogenation mechanism, transmethylation mechanism) have been proposed for the hydrodesulfurization process, the exact mechanism remains elusive to date. 4,6It is, however, noteworthy that the hydrosulfide unit has been proposed to be involved in the HDS process.−13 It is therefore no wonder that extensive research work has been undertaken by various groups to develop new and efficient desulfurization processes using both hetero-and homogeneous catalysts.−21 A majority of such processes involve the oxidative desulfurization (ODS) reaction, 17−21 where the organosulfur compounds are converted to the corresponding sulfones in the presence of an oxidant.The heterogeneous catalysts may be of different types, namely, transition metal oxides stabilized by porous solid substrates, metal−organic frameworks, ionic liquids, carbon materials, and polyoxometalates. 17Transition metal-sulfide clusters, such as Mo−Co−S clusters, 22 have often been used as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the desulfurization of thiols and thiophenes, albeit at high temperatures (110−300 °C), 23−26 and a detailed discussion regarding the same is available in the literature. 27NiMo/SBA-15 28 and nickel phosphides (Ni 2 P/ SiO 2 ) 29 have been used as catalysts for the hydrodesulfurization of thiophenes, dibenzothiophene, and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene.Intercalation compounds of MoS 2 have also been used as HDS catalysts, 30−32 and an overview of the same may be found elsewhere. 33−58 It may be noted that the zero sulfur content in oil is rapidly becoming a worldwide requirement and thus may have consequences in the oil refining industries.The conventional HDS processes, however, fail to meet such requirement of zero sulfur level fuels, while at the same time maintaining the other important fuel requirements such as boiling range, cetane index, total acid number, overall aromatics content, benzene content, vapor pressure, O 2 content, etc.−62 Transition metal mediated C−S bond cleavage of organosulfur substrates is therefore being actively pursued by various research groups around the world.A large number of reports on Co, 34−38 Fe, 39−41 Ni, 42−46 Mo, 47−52 W, 53 Rh, 37,54,55 Ir, 37,56 Ru, 35,39,41,55,57,58 Os, 35 Pd, 42 and Pt 43 mediated desulfurization of organosulfur substrates are available in the literature.−50 One of the most difficult substrates in the hydrodesulfurization process of fossil fuels is dibenzothiophene, especially alkylated dibenzothiophenes.Therefore, it is not surprising that most of the literature reports directed °C temperature to yield biphenyl and 3-methylbiphenyl, respectively. 63Insertion of Pt(PPh 3 ) 2 group by activation of the C−S bond of benzothiophene via coordination of an electrophilic transition-metal fragment, ML n (M = Mn, Ru), to the carbocyclic ring of 2,5-dimethylthiophene (Scheme 1a), benzothiophene, and dibenzothiophene has also been reported. 12C−S bond of thiophene and 2-methylthiophene could also be activated using [Cp*IrH 3 ] 2 in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor. 64Interestingly, in the case of 2methylthiophene, activation of the C−S bond occurred along with a concomitant double hydride transfer and olefin migration to yield a stable adduct (Scheme 1b). 64Reactivity of thiophenes toward various molybdenum compounds was investigated due to the importance of molybdenum as a crucial component of HDS catalysts.While the compound, [{Me 2 Si-(C 5 Me 4 ) 2 }MoH 2 ], could activate the C−S bonds of both thiophene and benzothiophene, C−S bond activation of dibenzothiophene did not take place and resulted in the formation of a molybdenum dibenzothiophene complex instead (Scheme 1c). 51Further investigation regarding the reactivity of thiophenes with molybdenum complexes showed that thiophene reacts with Mo(PMe 3 ) 6 at room temperature (Scheme 1d) to yield a thiophene adduct and a butadiene− thiolate complex (favored at low temperature) which do not undergo interconversion and thus may indicate that C−S bond cleavage may not necessarily be facilitated by an η 5 -thiophene coordination.Generation of the butadiene-thiolate complex involves C−S bond cleavage of thiophene and subsequent hydrogenation, where the necessary hydrogen is supplied by the PMe 3 ligand, thereby converting PMe 3 to a cyclometalated η 2 -CH 2 PMe 2 ligand (Scheme 1d).The molybdenum compound, Mo(PMe 3 ) 6 , could also cleave the C−S bonds of benzothiophene (Scheme 1e) to yield a paramagnetic compound, which, in turn, undergoes rapid isomerization to yield an olefin-thiophenolate complex (favored at low temperature) and a 1-metallacyclopropene-thiophenolate complex (favored at high temperature).Reaction of these two complexes with H 2 yields the same compound, [Mo-(PMe 3 ) 4 (SC 6 H 4 Et)H 3 ] (Scheme 1e), and thus demonstrates partial hydrogenation of benzothiophene on a molybdenum center.

−68 A highly reactive tungsten compound, [W-(PMe 3 ) 4 (η 2 -CH 2 PMe 2 )H], has been shown to mediate the complete desulfurization of thiophene, benzothiophene, and dibenzothiophene (Scheme 2a). 53The reaction of [W-(PMe 3 ) 4 (η 2 -CH 2 PMe 2 )H] with thiophene involves C−S bond cleavage along with a subsequent hydrogen transfer reaction and generates a butadiene-thiolate compound.The butadiene-thiolate compound then produces a butane-thiolate compound, which upon thermolysis releases but-1-ene.On the other hand, reaction of [W(PMe 3 ) 4 (η 2 -CH 2 PMe 2 )H] with benzothiophene follows a pathway that is analogous to that reported earlier for Mo(PMe complex and biphenyl in 67% and 64% yields, respectively. 65inally, a unique method for the complete desulfurization of dibenzothiophene via a double C−S bond activation− desulfurization process was achieved by the use of the trinuclear ruthenium−carbonyl compound, [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ]. 68pon treatment of dibenzothiophene with [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] in heptane, a dinuclear ruthenium compound was obtained via C−S bond activation and desulfurization (Scheme 2d), which upon further treatment with H 2 under mild conditions produced biphenyl.

It may be noted that most of the literature reports on transition metal mediated desulfurization of organosulfur substrates used organometallic compounds.A closer look into the available literature reports also shows that many of these reactions required heating at high temperatures (≥100 °C) for a long period of time, 35,42,[51][52][53]55 while some others included photolysis (UV light) 51 or high-pressure Hg lamp irradiation for 12−25 h. 40 Mo][44][45]56,57,69 The conditions of these catalytic reactions described in some of these reports again include either irradiation with blue LED 56 or visible light, 57 or heating at 110 °C for 14 h, 45 while some other reports include zincation of aryl sulfonium salts for 24 h, 44 or the use of alkyl Grignard reagents.43,69 A handful of reports on catalytic desulfurization of various organosulfur substrates are available in the literature and include desulfurization of dibenzothiophene and its sterically encumbered analogues using a platinum (1 mol % catalyst, yield = 20−75%) 43 and a nickel catalyst (1−0.1 mol % catalyst, yield = 90−100%), 43,69 desulfurization of aryl dimethylsulfonium triflates using a Ni(II) catalyst (10 mol % catalyst, yield = 52−96%), 44 reductive cleavage of C(sp 2 )-and C(sp 3 )-SMe bonds using a Ni(0) catalyst (5−20 mol % catalyst, yield = 70−100%), 45 desulfurization of cysteinyl peptides by [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ catalyst (5 mol % catalyst, yield = 70−89%, bpy = bipyridine), 57 and desulfurization of amino acids and small peptides having thiol and disulfide functionality by the use of an Ir(I)-containing photocatalyst (1 mol % catalyst, yield = 2−99%).56 These reports again include special reaction conditions such as the use of alkyl Grignard reagents, 43,69 irradiation with blue LED, 56 irradiation with visible light, 57 zincation of aryl sulfonium salts, 44 heating at 110 °C, 45 etc. Hoever, no report was available in the literature for the catalytic desulfurization of organosulfur substrates under ambient conditions and without the necessary involvement of cocatalysts/additional reagents.

The large number of literature reports on model desulfurization reactions in relation to the industrial HDS process is dominated primarily by reductive reactions with the involvement of various cocatalysts/additional reagents and most often involve exotic reaction conditions.In this connection, we envisaged that the hydrolysis of C−S bonds may be used as an alternative strategy for the desulfurization of organosulfur substrates such as thiols, which would be converted to alcohols/phenols.The hydrolysis of C−S bonds would not be related directly to the reaction involved in the industrial HDS process (hydrogenolysis), especially because the HDS process is used for the desulfurization of crude oil.A hydrolysis reaction, nevertheless, would involve a benign chemical, water, as the main reagent, and selected first-row transition metals may be used to mediate the reaction, preferably under ambient conditions.Transition metal mediated conversion of thiols to alcohols/phenols may release the sulfur functionality of the organosulfur substrates as hydrosulfide (HS − )/hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), which, in turn may be captured by the transition metal complexes and thus may lead to the isolation of new transition metal-hydrosulfide complexes as well.Characterization of such transition metal complexes in each step by spectroscopic methods and molecular structure determinations may also provide valuable insight into the reaction mechanism.

The idea for exploring the transition metal mediated hydrolysis of organosulfur substrates was inspired by the presence of various important hydrolytic enzymes in nature.It may be noted that few first-row transition metals are often used as an integral part of the active sites of enzymes that mediate the hydrolysis of various substrates in biological systems. 70,71xamples of such enzymes include carboxypeptidase A (Zn 2+ , hydrolysis of peptide bonds of C-terminal residues with large aromatic side chains), alkaline phosphatase (Zn 2+ , dephosphorylation of nucleotides, proteins, and alkaloids), liver alcohol dehydrogenase (Zn 2+ , oxidative conversion of an alcohol to an aldehyde), carbonic anhydrase (Zn 2+ , hydrolysis of CO 2 and COS), CS 2 hydrolase (Zn 2+ , hydrolysis of CS 2 and COS), arginase (Mn 2+ , final step in the urea cycle which facilitates removal of nitrogenous waste during catabolism of proteins), urease (Ni 2+ , hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbamate, which, in turn, generates ammonia and bicarbonate), and thioesterases (Zn 2+ , Fe 2+/3+ ; hydrolysis of thioesters).Among these, the examples most relevant to C−S bond hydrolysis are the carbonic anhydrase, CS 2 hydrolase, and thioesterases.Carbonic anhydrase and CS 2 hydrolase feature tetrahedral Zn(II)−OH 2 cores housed within (N His ) 3 and (N His )(S Cys ) 2 coordination spheres in their active sites, respectively, and demonstrate a somewhat complementary reactivity pattern.A tetrahedral Zn(II) center attached to the protein backbone by three amino acid residues and a catalytically important water (or hydroxide) ligand in the fourth coordination site is a common structural motif for zinc enzymes in general.While carbonic anhydrase specifically mediates the hydrolysis of CO 2 and COS instead of CS 2 , the CS 2 hydrolase preferentially mediates the hydrolysis of CS 2 and COS instead of CO 2 .The hydrolysis of the substrates by the active sites of these two enzymes, however, follows a similar mechanism and involves the coordination of H 2 O at the Zn(II) site.The pK a of the coordinated H 2 O decreases significantly, which in turn facilitates the deprotonation of the coordinated H 2 O to generate an intermediate of the type Zn(II)−OH.This intermediate serves as the nucleophile toward the substrates (CX 2 , X = S, O) and leads to the generation of species of the type, [Zn II -XC(X)(OH)].The coordinated carbonate/thiocarbonate is then replaced with H 2 O to regenerate the Zn(II)−OH 2 core.A handful of reports related to the structural and functional model complexes of zinc enzymes in general, 13,72 and carbonic anhydrase and CS 2 hydrolase in particular, 73−77 are available in the literature.However, there are only two reports which involve the Zn(II) mediated hydrolysis of COS and/or CS 2 . 76,77These reports include the reaction of Zn(II) hydroxide complexes with COS or CS 2 in MeOH or EtOH to yield complexes of the type [(TPA)Zn-SC(S)OCH 3 ] 1+ , [(TPA)Zn-SC(O)OCH 3 ] 1+ , and [(TPA)Zn-SC(O)OCH 2 CH 3 ] 1+ , which could be easily hydrolyzed upon treatment with H 2 O (in MeCN) to produce a Zn(II)-hydrosulfide complex, [(TPA)Zn-SH] (where TPA is tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine). 77Another report has shown that a phenolate bridged binuclear Zn(II)-aqua complex, [{(L)Zn-(OH 2 )} 2 ] 2+ , could mediate the hydrolysis of CS 2 in the presence of Et 3 N to afford H 2 S. 76 Apart from such studies on homogeneous reaction systems, several heterogeneous reaction systems for the hydrolysis of COS and CS 2 have also been reported in the literature. 78Few examples of such a heterogeneous catalytic system include catalytic hydrolysis of COS and CS 2 over Fe 2 O 3 cluster, 79 hydrolysis of COS by γ-Al 2 O 3 at 220 °C, 80 and catalytic hydrolysis of COS by Fe− Cu−Ce based activate carbon. 81Thioesterases, 82 on the other hand, are a broad family of enzymes and hydrolyze thioester bonds in various important biochemical pathways, such as in fatty acid synthesis.The thioesterase hydroxyglutathione hydrolases family of enzymes includes human glyoxalase II, the active site of which contains a binuclear Zn(II) species and catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoylglutathione to form glutathione and D-lactic acid. 83The mitochondrial glyoxalase II from A. thaliana, on the other hand, predominantly contains a binuclear Fe(III)Zn(II) species in its active site and mediates the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoylglutathione. 84 The active site of glyoxalase II from Salmonella typhimurium contains different ratios of manganese, iron, and zinc and hydrolyzes S-(2hydroxyacyl)glutathione derivatives to regenerate glutathione. 85onsidering the immense importance of desulfurization reactions and the fact that they are largely inspired by the reactivity of the hydrolytic enzymes in biological systems, we therefore initiated a detailed study on the reactivity of binuclear first-row transition metal complexes with thiolate (and other S-donor ligands) with the goal to find a new and efficient reaction strategy for the desulfurization of organosulfur substrates under ambient conditions.It is quite apparent that external stimuli mediated intramolecular cleavage of C−S bonds in a metal complex housed within an S-donor ligand may only give rise to metallacycle formations and/or ligand transformations.On the other hand, intermolecular C−S bond cleavage involving preformed transition metal complexes and externally added organosulfur substrates (such as thiolates) may allow the complete desulfurization of organosulfur substrates to yield new metal complexes featuring terminal or bridging hydrosulfide.Such reactions may also have an added advantage in a sense that the identity of the coordinating ligand and hence the required stability of the metal complexes may remain unchanged and thus should allow the unambiguous characterization of intermediates and final products.Therefore, we planned to examine the use of a hydrolysis reaction as a tool for the desulfurization of coordinated organosulfur substrates in binuclear first-row transition metal complexes.Choice of binuclear complexes over mononuclear complexes was made to achieve the cooperative effect from the two metal centers which may bind one organosulfur substrate and one water molecule in close proximity during the hydrolysis reactions.What follows next is a summary of the successful development of such a new, transition metal mediated, stoichiometric, and catalytic hydrolysis of C−S bonds in organosulfur substrates at ambient conditions without the necessity of any additional reagents or cocatalysts.


## TRANSITION METAL MEDIATED HYDROLYSIS OF C−S BONDS


### Hydrolysis of Thioesters

Thioesters are probably the easiest organosulfur substrates to undergo the hydrolysis of C−S bonds when compared with thiolates (especially aromatic thiolates), sulfides, thiophenes, and benzothiophenes.As a result, the hydrolysis of thioesters for the generation of thiols and carboxylic acid has been quite well-known for a long time, and examples of both base and acid promoted hydrolysis reactions are available in the literature.While the hydrolysis reactions of thioesters are generally carried out under basic conditions, such reactions are associated with problems such as (i) the requirement of more than equimolar amounts of the reagents and (ii) the formation of disulfides.An alternative approach is the acid-promoted hydrolysis of thioesters, which, however, is associated with high activation energies 86,87 and hence often requires the use of strong acids such as conc.HCl in an excess amount.

Nevertheless, an appreciable number of reports on both the base and acid promoted hydrolysis of various thioesters 88 are available in the literature.

Examples of base promoted hydrolysis reactions include the hydrolysis of triphenylmethyl thiobenzoate or α-benzoylbenzhydryl thiobenzoate in alcoholic sodium hydroxide to yield benzoic acid and the corresponding thiol; 89 alkaline hydrolysis of alkyl-, allyl-, benzyl-, trityl-thioacetates in aqueous acetone solution; 90,91 hydrolysis of S-methyl thioacetate and S-phenyl 5-dimethylamino-5-oxo-thiopentanoate; 92 general base catalyzed hydrolysis of ethyl trifluorothioacetate; 93 alkaline hydrolysis of formylthiocholine; 94 and hydrolyses of substituted S-aryl 4′-hydroxythiobenzoates, 95 of which the latter reactions have been shown to follow a dissociative pathway in mild alkaline medium and an associative mechanism in comparatively higher pH.On the other hand, examples of acid promoted hydrolysis reactions include the acid (conc.HCl) hydrolysis of triphenylmethyl thiobenzoate to yield triphenylmethyl carbinol and thiobenzoic acid; 89 acid hydrolysis of alkyl-, allyl-, benzyl-, trityl-thioacetates in aqueous acetone solution; 90,91 acid hydrolysis of S-methyl thioacetate and S-phenyl 5-dimethylamino-5-oxo-thiopentanoate; 92 and acid hydrolysis of formylthiocholine. 94he free energy of the thioester hydrolysis reactions has been investigated in detail, 96,97 and the values for the hydrolysis of S-acetyl mercaptopropanol have been reported to be ∼−7670 cal mol −1 and ∼−4400 cal mol −1 at pH 7 and at an ionic strength of 0.3, respectively. 97It has been proposed that the difference in the substituents on the thiol esters may not have a significant effect on the free energy of hydrolysis and that these values are also applicable for the free energy of many other thioesters of acetic acid with an error of nearly a few hundred calories.For example, the free energy of hydrolysis of N,S-diacetyl-β-mercaptoethylamine and S-acetylmercaptoacetate was found to be −4460 cal mol −1 and −4140 cal mol −1 , respectively. 96The rate constants for the base and acid mediated hydrolysis of S-methyl thioacetate in aqueous solution have been reported to be 1.6 × 10 −1 and 1.5 × 10 −5 M −1 s −1 , respectively, while at pH 7, the rate constant was found to be 3.6 × 10 −8 s −1 . 92These values also indicated the inhibition of the hydrolysis reaction under acidic conditions.Such inhibition of thioester hydrolysis reactions in an acidic solution has also been reported for the hydrolysis of other thioesters such as ethyl trifluorothiolacetate 98,99 and ethyl S-trifluoroacetylmercaptoacetate. 100 Moreover, acid catalyzed hydrolysis of water-insoluble thioesters is quite difficult to achieve without the involvement of various organic cosolvents.In order to circumvent this problem, acid promoted hydrolysis of a series of water-insoluble thioesters in pure water has been achieved by a hydrophobic polystyrene-supported sulfonic acid catalyst. 101ydrolysis of thioesters could also be promoted by various metal ions such as Tl 3+ , Hg 2+ , Hg 2 2+ , Ag + , Au 3+ , etc.−106 First-row transition metals have also been shown to promote the hydrolysis of thioesters, and examples include hydrolysis of a thioester (PhCH(OH)-C(O)SCD 3 ) by a mononuclear Zn(II) complex 107 and a binuclear Fe(III)Zn(II) complex, 108 and hydrolysis of hydroxyphenylthioacetic acid S-methyl ester by binuclear Zn(II)-hydroxide complexes where the binuclear complexes actually dissociate in solution to generate a mononuclear Zn(II)-hydroxide complex. 109


### Stoichiometric Hydrolysis of C−S Bonds of Thiolates, Sulfides, and Thiophenes

In contrast to the availability of such a large number of detailed reports on thioester hydrolysis, reports on the hydrolysis of thiols (especially aromatic thiols) to generate alcohols (or phenols) are virtually nonexistent in the literature.The only literature reports on the hydrolysis of C−S bonds in thiols include the oxidative hydrolysis processes which generate oxidized sulfur-containing products such as disulfides or sulfonates, along with alcohols. 110,111Examples include MnSO 4 •H 2 O mediated conversion of methanethiol to methanol and dimethyl disulfide at high temperatures (150− 280 °C) 79 and oxidation of diethyl disulfide with dioxygen in the presence of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate to yield ethyl sulfonate and ethyl alcohol, of which the latter product is often obtained only as a byproduct from the hydrolysis of ethyl sulfonate. 111he possible potential of the first-row transition metals to mediate the hydrolysis of the C−S bonds of thiolates was unveiled by an interesting observation during our quest for the synthesis and reactivity study of binuclear transition metal− thiolate complexes.5 hydrolysis of nitriles and related species by various cobalt and iron complexes, 116−120 and reaction of hydroxide bridged dicobalt(II) complexes with acetonitrile to yield acetamido bridged dicobalt complexes. 121In order to avoid the formation of [Co 2 (N-Et-HPTB)(μ-HNC(O)CH 3 )](BF 4 ) 2 , the attempted synthesis of [Co 2 (N-Et-HPTB)(μ-S t Bu)](BF 4 ) 2 was therefore performed in DMF instead of MeCN.However, to our surprise, addition of Co(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O into a mixture of HN-Et-HPTB, NaS t Bu and Et 3 N in DMF at room temperature (RT) allowed the isolation of a binuclear Co(II)-hydrosulfide compound, [Co 2 (N-Et-HPTB)(SH)(H 2 O)](BF 4 ) 2 (2a(BF 4 ) 2 ), while analysis of the mother liquor by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed the formation of t BuOH. 113n analogous reaction using NaSEt (instead of NaS t Bu) at RT again yielded 2a, while the use of a different binucleating ligand, HN-CH 2 Py-HPTB (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-(1-picolylbenzimidazolyl))-2-hydroxy-1,3-diaminipropane), in combination with NaS t Bu at RT yielded [Co 2 (N-CH 2 Py-HPTB)(SH)-(H 2 O)](BF 4 ) 2 (2b(BF 4 ) 2 ).These results confirmed the reaction to be a Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of the C−S bond in NaSEt and NaS t Bu.Control experiments revealed that the (i) involvement of a binucleating ligand (such as N-Et-HPTB 1− or N-CH 2 Py-HPTB 1− ) and hence generation of a binuclear Co(II) unit in the reaction solution was essential for the reaction to proceed; (ii) involvement of a base (such as Et 3 N or t BuNH 2 ) was absolutely necessary; (iii) addition of water in the reaction increases the yield as expected for a hydrolysis reaction; and (iv) once bridged, such as in [Co 2 (N-Et-HPTB)(μ-SEt)](BF 4 ) 2 , the thiolates could not undergo the hydrolysis reaction.Based on these results, a working mechanism for the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis reaction was proposed (Scheme 3).The proposed mechanism involved (i) the generation of a binuclear Co(II) solvento complex of the type 1+ (not shown in Scheme 3), (iii) which f inally released the hydrolyzed product, alcohol (R 2 OH), and the binuclear Co(II)hydrosulfide complexes,2a and 2b.The hydrolysis might be affected by either a coordinated H 2 O or a coordinated OH − (not shown in Scheme 3).While the initial binuclear Co(II) solvento complex (1a) and the final products (2a, 2b) were characterized by single-crystal X-ray structure determination, the identity of the proposed active intermediate, I (Scheme 3), could not be confirmed.Nevertheless, this work was the first report for transition metal mediated hydrolysis of thiolates to alcohols at ambient conditions, and hence, we went forward to explore the new reaction in detail using Co(II), Mn(II), Fe(II), and Zn(II) in different ligand platforms.

It was soon realized that in contrast to the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of C−S bonds, Mn(II) and Zn(II) (in the presence of N-Et-HPTB 1− ligand) could not mediate the hydrolysis of thiolates and instead allowed only the isolation of binuclear Mn(II)/Zn(II)-thiolate complexes. 122,123Interestingly, Fe(II) could replicate the chemistry described in Scheme 3 for Co(II) and thus the reaction of Fe(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O, HN-Et-HPTB and Et 3 N with either R 2 SH (R 2 = t Bu, CH 2 Ph) or NaS t Bu in DMF produced a binuclear Fe(II)-hydrosulfide complex, [Fe 2 (N-Et-HPTB)(SH)(H 2 O)](BF 4 ) 2 (3(BF 4 ) 2 ) (confirmed by singlecrystal X-ray structure determination) and the alcohols, R 2 OH (identified and quantified by GC-MS). 124Compound 3(BF 4 ) 2 was isostructural with 2a(BF 4 ) 2 and could also be synthesized by the reaction of a preformed diiron(II)-solvento compound, [Fe 2 (N-Et-HPTB)(DMF) 4 ](BF 4 ) 3 (4(BF 4 ) 3 ), similar to 1a(BF 4 ) 3 , with NaS t Bu in the presence of Et 3 N in DMF.The yields of 3(BF 4 ) 2 (71−75% for R 2 = t Bu and 33% for R 2 = CH 2 Ph) were also comparable with the yields of the corresponding alcohols ( t BuOH, 82%; PhCH 2 OH, 26%) and thus indicated a clean stoichiometric reaction.The results obtained with Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis of aliphatic thiolates therefore indicated that a mechanism identical or very similar to that proposed in Scheme 3 for the Co(II) mediated reaction might be operative.However, neither Co(II) nor Fe(II) could mediate the hydrolysis of aromatic thiolates (in the presence of N-Et-HPTB 1− ), C−S bonds of which are comparatively more difficult to cleave than those of aliphatic thiolates.Therefore, we planned to explore the newly developed reaction with Co(II) and Fe(II) in different binucleating ligands in order to expand the substrate scope, isolate the intermediate (I), and get more information regarding this hydrolysis reaction.

It may be noted that the ligand, N-Et-HPTB 1− , provides a combination of imidazole N-donor and alkoxo O-donor atoms to the two transition metal centers.Therefore, in the next stage, we selected the binucleating ligands having different combinations of donor atoms.Choices of such ligands included BPMP 1− (HBPMP is 2,6-bis[[bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl]-4-methylphenol) and PhBIMP 1− (HPhBIMP is 2,6-bis[bis[(N-1-methyl-4,5-diphenylimidazoylmethyl)amino]methyl]-4-methylphenol), of which the former provided a combination of pyridine N-donors and phenoxo Odonor whereas the latter provided a combination of imidazole N-donors and phenoxo O-donor.Addition of Co(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O into a mixture of HBPMP, Et 3 N, and 1 equiv of NaS t Bu, in DMF at RT allowed the isolation of the dicobalt(II)hydrosulfide compound, [Co 2 (BPMP)(μ-SH)(MeCN)](BF 4 ) 2 (5a(BF 4 ) 2 ), while the use of 2 equiv of NaS t Bu in the same reaction yielded a dicobalt(II)-bis(hydrosulfide) compound, [Co 2 (BPMP)(SH) 2 ](BF 4 ) (5b(BF 4 )). 125It was also found that unlike the essential role of Et 3 N to promote the hydrolysis of thiolates in the case of N-Et-HPTB 1− ligand, 113,124 the reaction system involving Co(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O and HBPMP could mediate the hydrolysis of NaS t Bu even in the absence of Et 3 N.However, while the generation of 5a and 5b confirmed the C− S bond cleavage of NaS t Bu, the compounds 5a(BF 4 ) 2 and 5b(BF 4 ) were often contaminated with small amount of a hydroxo-bridged dicobalt(II) compound, [Co 2 (BPMP)(μ− OH)](BF 4 ) 2 (5c(BF 4 ) 2 ), formation of which could not be completely avoided even in the absence of Et 3 N.Therefore, we planned to explore the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis reactions using the PhBIMP 1− ligand.Addition of Co(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O into a mixture of HPhBIMP, Et 3 N, and NaS t Bu, in DMF followed by stirring at RT allowed the isolation of a hydrosulfide bridged dicobalt(II) compound, [Co 2 (PhBIMP)(μ-SH)-(DMF)](BF 4 ) 2 (6a(BF 4 ) 2 ) while the thiolate was converted to t BuOH. 125The use of Et 3 N was found not to be essential, although the use of Et 3 N increased the yield of the products to some extent.Interestingly, this reaction system could hydrolyze NaSPh as well, and 6a(BF 4 ) 2 was again obtained in comparable yield (61% as compared to 68% in the case of NaS t Bu) while the generation of t BuOH (47%) and PhOH (57%) was identified and quantified by GC-MS.Moreover, the reaction was also found to be operative in five other solvents, namely, THF, MeOH, EtOH, EtOAc, and MeCN (in the absence of Et 3 N in order to avoid the formation of acetamide).In each case (except when the solvent was MeCN) the generation of 6a(BF 4 ) 2 and the alcohol corresponding to the thiolate used (NaS t Bu/NaSCH 2 (CH 2 ) 10 CH 3 ) was confirmed by singlecrystal X-ray structure determination and GC-MS, respectively.In the case of MeCN, the hydrolysis reaction allowed the isolation of the hydrosulfide bridged dicobalt(II) compound [Co 2 (PhBIMP)(μ-SH)(MeCN)](BF 4 ) 2 (6b(BF 4 ) 2 ), which differs from 6a(BF 4 ) 2 only by the identity of the coordinated solvent molecule.Binuclear solvent coordinated dicobalt(II) complexes such as [Co 2 (PhBIMP)(MeCN) 2 ](BF 4 ) 3 (6c(BF 4 ) 3 ) and [Co 2 (PhBIMP)(H 2 O) 2 (DMF) 2 ](BF 4 ) 3 (6d(BF 4 ) 3 ) were also isolated and characterized, generation of which may be considered as the first step for the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiols/thiolates.Considering the yields of 6a(BF 4 ) 2 in the six solvents (yield = 35−50% when the solvents are THF, MeOH, EtOH, EtOAc, and MeCN), DMF (yield = 68%) was found to be the best solvent for the hydrolysis reactions.With these results, we then went forward to explore the hydrolysis reaction for a wide range of 25 substrates in the presence of Et 3 N in DMF at RT, and the results are summarized in Table 1 for selected substrates. 125−9 These results thus established the newly developed hydrolytic C−S bond cleavage reaction to be an efficient reaction with a broad scope of substrates.Moreover, the following also became quite clear: (i) The transition metal mediated hydrolytic C−S bond cleavage reaction can be performed in the presence of binucleating ligands with a combination of N-/ O-donors.(ii) PhBIMP 1− is the best binucleating ligand among the four ligands (the other three being N-Et-HPTB 1− and N-CH 2 Py-HPTB 1− allowing the hydrolysis of only aliphatic thiolates, and BPMP 1− which could not of fer a clean reaction) explored so far.(iii) DMF is the best solvent for carrying out the hydrolysis reaction.(iv) Use of Et 3 N may not be necessary to mediate the hydrolysis reaction although use of Et 3 N may facilitate the reaction to some extent.The results obtained from the study on Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of organosulfur substrates using BPMP 1− and PhBIMP 1− ligands are summarized in Scheme 4 for selected substrates.It may, however, be noted that the organic products obtained for diphenylsulfide and thiophene derivatives (listed in Scheme 4) were not straightforward hydrolyzed products (for example, products for diphenyl sulfide, thiophene, and dibenzothiophene were benzene, γ-butyrolactone, and biphenyl, respectively; see Table 1), while no reasonable organic product could be identified in the case of cyclohexanethiol, 4-methylbenzenethiol, 4-methoxybenzenethiol, pentafluorobenzenethiol, 4-mercaptopyridine, 2-thiobarbituric acid, dimethylsulfide, tetrahydrothiophene, 2-bromothiophene, 3-aminothiophene-2-carboxaldehyde, and 2-methyl thiophene, by GC-MS.Nevertheless, the isolation of the hydrosulfide bridged dicobalt(II) compound, 6a(BF 4 ) 2 , in all these cases indicated the complete desulfurization of these organosulfur substrates.Moreover, the substrates 2-mercaptophenol and 2-aminothiophenol featured O-and N-donor functional groups, respectively, in addition to the thiol group, and hence might potentially bind to the Co(II) centers as chelating ligand, which in turn might hinder the reaction.Successful desulfurization of even these two substrates to generate catechol and 2-aminophenol in 40% and 19% yields, respectively, suggested moderate functional group tolerance as well.However, considering the results of the hydrolysis of all 25 substrates, it was noted that the hydrolysis reaction was most efficient for aliphatic and aromatic thiols/thiolates while it was comparatively less effective for the most difficult substrates such as thiophenes and dibenzothiophene.Despite the indication of the more efficient nature of PhBIMP 1− ligand in the Co(II) mediated study, 125 both BPMP 1− and PhBIMP 1− were explored again for Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates in order to compare and confirm the relative effectiveness of these two binucleating ligands further in such reactions.

Addition of Fe(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O into a mixture of HBPMP, Et 3 N, and a series of thiols/thiolates (RSH: R = n Bu, CPh 3 , CH 2 Ph; NaSR: R = Me, Et, t Bu), in DMF at RT allowed the isolation of the compound, [Fe 2 (BPMP)(SH) 2 (MeOH) 2 ]-(BF 4 ) (7a(BF 4 )), while the corresponding alcohols (ROH) were obtained in 19−57% yields. 126Unlike the generation of the hydroxo-bridged dicobalt(II) compound 5c(BF 4 ) 2 , the Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiols/thiolates using the BPMP 1− ligand was found to offer a clean reaction.It was also observed that the reaction could be carried out with varying yields of 7a(BF 4 ) (investigated with NaSEt as the substrate) in 5 other solvents, namely, MeCN (42%), THF (50%), EtOAc (56%), MeOH (54%), and EtOH (61%).However, the reaction system involving BPMP 1− and Fe(II) could not mediate the hydrolysis of aromatic thiols and the only product obtained after attempted C−S bond cleavage of NaSPh was a mixture of [Fe 2 (BPMP)(H 2 O) 2 ] 3+ and [Fe 2 (BPMP)(SPh)(DMF)] 2+ (identified by mass spectrometry).Therefore, we moved forward to investigate the Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis of different thiolates using the PhBIMP 1− ligand.A reaction system consisting of Fe(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O, HPhBIMP, Et 3 N and a series of thiols/thiolates (RSH: R = n Bu, CH 2 (CH 2 ) 10 CH 3 , CH 2 Ph, Ph, 2,6-Me 2 -C 6 H 4 ; NaSR: R = Me, Et, t Bu) allowed the isolation of the compound [Fe 2 (PhBIMP)(μ-SH)(DMF)](BF 4 ) 2 (8a(BF 4 ) 2 ) in 12−36% yields (compared with 35−68% yields for 6a(BF 4 ) 2 ), while the corresponding alcohols/phenols were obtained in 7−68% yields (compared with 44−84% for the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis reaction, Table 1).Moreover, while an attempted Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis reaction of thioacetate by the use of BPMP 1− produced the compound [Fe 2 (BPMP)(CH 3 C(O)-S) 2 ](BF 4 ) (7b(BF 4 )) as the sole product, the same reaction in  O for the Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiols/thiolates were performed using the PhBIMP 1− ligand, and the results established that (i) the presence of a binucleating ligand, and hence initial generation of a binuclear complex such as  126 While a combination of the results obtained from the Co(II) and Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis of organosulfur substrates in the four different binucleating ligands 113,124−126 allowed some understanding regarding the mechanism and the identity of the initial binuclear transition metal complex and the binuclear transition metal-hydrosulfide complexes, the proposed intermediate (I, Scheme 3) could be identified only by mass spectrometry. 126It was perceived that such an active intermediate might be isolated only if the reaction became sluggish.It may be noted that the effective nuclear charge for the first-row transition metals increases upon going from left to right in the periodic table, and hence, the nucleophilicity of a coordinated OH − or the pK a of a coordinated H 2 O will decrease upon going from left to right in the periodic table, which, in turn, should make the first-row transition metal mediated hydrolysis of C−S bonds less and less facile in the Scheme 4. Schematic Presentation for the Co(II) Mediated Hydrolysis of C−S Bonds in NaS t Bu and in a Series of Thiolates Using BPMP 1− and PhBIMP 1− Ligands, Respectively same order.With this idea, we planned to explore Zn(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates, which according to the proposition should be the least facile process.However, studies toward reactivity of Zn(II) with thiolates in the presence of N-Et-HPTB 1d − and BPMP 1− revealed that Zn(II) was ineffective in mediating the hydrolysis reaction and stable binuclear Zn(II) complexes with either bridging 122 or terminal 127 thiolate were isolated instead.Therefore, we went forward to explore the possibility of Zn(II) mediated hydrolysis reaction in the presence of PhBIMP 1− ligand and possible isolation of the intermediate species analogous to I. Effectiveness of the Zn(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates in the presence of PhBIMP 1 , however, was found to be moderate.While on one hand thiolate/thiocarboxylate bridged Zn(II) complexes of the type [Zn 2 (PhBIMP)(μ-SR)](BF 4 ) 2 (R = Ph, 9a(BF 4 ) 2 ; 3−Br-C 6 H 4 , 9b(BF 4 ) 2 , C(O)Ph, 9c(BF 4 ) 2 ) could be isolated and characterized, a series of aliphatic and aromatic thiolates could also be hydrolyzed to generate the corresponding alcohols/ phenols (Scheme 5). 128Reaction of a binuclear Zn(II)solvento complex, [Zn 2 (PhBIMP)(DMF) 2 ](BF 4 ) 3 (9d(BF 4 ) 3 ), with NaSCH 2 Ph in the presence of H 2 O and Et 3 N allowed the isolation of the binuclear Zn(II)-hydrosulfide compound, [Zn 2 (PhBIMP)(μ-SH)(DMF)](BF 4 ) 2 (9e(BF 4 ) 2 ), in 78% yield, along with the formation of PhCH 2 OH in 94% yield.The role of H 2 O (hydrolysis) was further confirmed by using H 2 18 O which led to the generation of 9e(BF 4 ) 2 and PhCH 2 18 OH in 77% and 90% yields, respectively.In order to bypass the difficulty and time required for the crystallization of 9d(BF 4 ) 3 , hydrolysis of a series of thiolates was, however, performed by the direct use of a hydrated Zn(II) salt in the presence of the PhBIMP 1− , Et 3 N, and H 2 O in DMF.Hydrolysis of a total of 9 thiolates (NaSR: R= Et, t Bu, CH 2 Ph, CH 2 (CH 2 ) 4 CH 3 , CH 2 (CH 2 ) 8 CH 3 , CH 2 (CH 2 ) 10 CH 3 , Ph, 2,6-Me-C 6 H 3 , and 2,4-Me-C 6 H 3 ) was investigated, which allowed the isolation of 9e(BF 4 ) 2 in 30−58% yield while the alcohols (24−80%) and phenols (40−54%) were generated in varying yields.Moreover, treatment of 9a(BF 4 ) 2 with H 2 O and Et 3 N in DMF could also affect the hydrolysis of the coordinated PhS − and allow the isolation of 9e(BF 4 ) 2 along with the generation of PhOH.This reaction was further investigated by using H 2   18   O, which again led to the generation of Ph 18 OH.

## was essential for the hydrolysis reaction; (ii) presence of H 2 O was absolutely necessary for the reaction; (iii) use of Et 3 N was essential for thiols (for deprotonation) but not for thiolates although presence of Et

In the same line, the coordinated PhC(O)S − in 9c(BF 4 ) 2 could also be hydrolyzed to generate [Zn 2 (PhBIMP)(μ-O 2 CPh)(MeCN)](BF 4 ) 2 (9f(BF 4 ) 2 ) (conversion of thiobenzoate to benzoate) while generation of hydrosulfide in the reaction solution was confirmed by precipitation of CuS.An experiment involving H 2 18 O again showed the generation of [Zn 2 (PhBIMP)(μ- 18 OOCPh)(MeCN)] 2+ (9f 18O ) by mass spectrometric analysis.All of these results indicated that the Scheme 5. Schematic Presentation for the Zn(II) Mediated Hydrolysis of Thiolates Using the PhBIMP 1− Ligand Zn(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates followed a mechanism similar to that proposed in Scheme 3. Interestingly, it was observed that unlike the Co(II) and Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis reactions involving the same ligand, the presence of Et 3 N was essential for the Zn(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates.Moreover, a critical analysis of several control reactions confirmed that unlike I in Scheme 3, the active intermediate in this case was a binuclear Zn(II)-thiolato complex featuring a coordinated hydroxide (instead of a coordinated H 2 O), [Zn 2 (PhBIMP)(μ-SR)(OH)] 1+ (9g, R = Ph), which was generated in solution only in the presence of Et 3 N, and as a consequence, no hydrolysis could be observed in the absence of Et 3 N.However, despite our best efforts, the intermediate could not be characterized by molecular structure determination.

Considering that the intermediate of the Zn(II) mediated hydrolysis differed from that proposed for Co(II) and Fe(II) mediated processes and also due to the unavailability of molecular structures for species similar to either I or 9g, we planned to explore the Ni(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates in the presence of BPMP 1− ligand.It was noted that while Co(II) and Fe(II) could mediate facile C−S bond hydrolysis reactions in the presence of the BPMP 1 ligand, Zn(II) was unable to do so.Therefore, it was anticipated that Ni(II) in the presence of BPMP 1− ligand might offer a sluggish reaction and hence was selected to be the choice of metal for further study directed toward the isolation and characterization of the active intermediate (I, Scheme 3) that precedes the C−S bond cleavage of thiolates.Indeed, unlike the Co(II) and Fe(II) mediated facile C−S bond cleavage reactions, 125,126


### Consecutive Cleavage of C−S and S−S Bonds in Disulfides

Having established the hydrolysis of thiolates in the presence of PhBIMP 1− ligand to be the most efficient process among the four reaction systems using four different binucleating ligands (Schemes 3 and 4), we went forward to expand the scope of this reaction with disulfides.−9 It may, however, be noted that the complete desulfurization of disulfides (R-S-S-R) would require the cleavage of two C−S bonds and one S−S bond, of which the former may involve a hydrolysis reaction to generate 2 equiv of alcohol/phenol while the latter may involve a 2 electron redox process involving the Co(II) or Fe(II) centers (Scheme 7).Incomplete desulfurization processes involving the simultaneous cleavage of C−S and S−S bonds of bis(trifluoromethyl)trisulfide by the use of Grignard reagents 129,130 and organolithium reagents 131,132 at −78 °C were reported in the literature, while alkyl disulfides were recovered unreacted under similar reaction conditions. 130owever, there was no report available for transition metal mediated complete desulfurization of disulfides involving the cleavage of both C−S and S−S bonds.Addition of Co(BF 4 ) 2 • 6H 2 O into a mixture of HPhBIMP and a series of disulfides (RS-SR: R = Me, t Bu, CH 2 Ph, CH 2 (CH 2 ) 10 CH 3 ) in DMF at RT allowed the isolation of 6a(BF 4 ) 2 in 41−52% yields while the corresponding alcohols/phenols were obtained in 54− 100% yields (ratios of the yields of 6a(BF 4 ) 2 and alcohols were ∼1:2, as expected). 133The cleavage of a S−S bond, however, would involve a 2 electron redox process and hence would require the generation of a dicobalt(III) species during the reaction (Scheme 7).Indeed, mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction solution for all of the desulfurization reactions involving different disulfides showed the generation of a common species, [Co III 2 (PhBIMP)(H 2 O) 2 (DMF) 2 ] 5+ (6e) in each case.Generation of such a species was never observed during the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates and diphenyl sulfide, where only the hydrolysis reaction was involved. 125In line with this, the Co(II) mediated complete desulfurization of diacetyl disulfide and dibenzoyl disulfide would therefore generate 6a(BF 4 ) 2 , 6e, and the corresponding carboxylic acids (instead of alcohols), which in turn might replace the bridging hydrosulfide in 6a(BF 4 ) 2 to generate carboxylate bridged dicobalt(II) complexes.Indeed, generation of 6a(BF 4 ) 2 and the carboxylate bridged dicobalt(II) complexes, [Co 2 (PhBIMP)(RCOO)(MeCN)] 2+ (R = Me, 6f; Ph, 6g), were confirmed by a combination of single-crystal X-ray structure determination and mass spectrometry, while the generation of 6e in the reaction solution was again observed by mass spectrometry.Very similar observations were noted for Fe(II) mediated complete desulfurization of disulfides (RS-SR: R = Me, t Bu, CH 2 Ph, CH 2 (CH 2 ) 10 CH 3 ) which again allowed the isolation of 8a(BF 4 ) 2 and the corresponding alcohols in ∼1:2 ratio of yields.However, the yields of 8a(BF 4 ) 2 were found to be much lower (20−36%) compared with that obtained for 6a(BF 4 ) 2 (41−52%), thus indicating that the Co(II) mediated process is more efficient than the Fe(II) mediated one.Generation of a diiron(III) species with the apparent formulation [Fe III 2 (PhBIMP)-(H 2 O) 2 (DMF) 2 ] 5+ (8d) was again observed by mass spectrometry, and its identity (Scheme 7) was further confirmed by comparing with the mass spectrometric and electronic absorption spectroscopic data for that of an authentic sample (independently synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electronic absorption spectroscopy).On the other hand, Fe(II) mediated complete desulfurization of diacetyl disulfide and dibenzoyl disulfide allowed the generation of 8a(BF 4 ) 2 , [Fe 2 (PhBIMP)(RCOO)(MeCN)] 2+ (R = Me, 8e; Ph, 8f) and 8d and were confirmed for the first two species by a combination of single-crystal X-ray structure determination and mass spectrometry while the generation of 8d was again identified by mass spectrometry.Interestingly, the reaction systems involving HPhBIMP and either Co(II) or Fe(II) could also desulfurize elemental sulfur (S 8 ) to yield 6a(BF 4 ) 2 and 8a(BF 4 ) 2 in 53% and 22% yields, respectively, while the generation of S


### Catalytic Hydrolysis of Thiolates

After the successful demonstration of first-row transition metal (Fe II , Co II , Ni II , Zn II ) mediated hydrolysis of a series of thiolate and other organosulfur substrates, isolation, and characterization of the all the species involved in the reaction, we planned to upgrade this reaction from a stoichiometric reaction to a catalytic one.A careful analysis of the molecular structures of the dicobalt(II)-hydrosulfide complex, 6a (and its isostructural iron analogue, 8a), revealed that (i) one of the two Co(II) centers (Co1) was five-coordinated (Scheme 8) thereby offering an available coordination site, (ii) the metal− ligand bond might not be strong enough to yield a stable dicobalt(II) complex with six-coordination at both the cobalt centers, and (iii) the hydrosulfide bridged the two Co(II) centers in an unsymmetrical manner with very different Co− SH distances of 2.644( 1 ) remained nearly invariable.Therefore, we went forward to explore the catalytic hydrolysis of C−S bonds for a series of thiolates with the following optimum conditions: (i) thiolate:H 2 O = 1:16, (ii) catalyst (6a): aliphatic thiolate = 1:5, catalyst (6a):aromatic thiolate = 1:3, and (iii) reaction time = 30 h (aliphatic thiolates), 120 h (aromatic thiolates).It was also found that the catalytic hydrolysis of thiolates was not favorable under acidic conditions, while the use of a base, such as Et 3 N, did not improve the results.Catalytic hydrolysis of a total of 11 substrates (Scheme 8) was explored at RT, 136 and the results (Table 2) showed that the catalysis was comparatively more efficient for aliphatic thiolates (yield of alcohols = 81−90%) than that for the aromatic thiolates (yield of phenols = 31−52%), which, however, was consistent with our previous reports on stoichiometric hydrolysis of thiolates 125 and the reported level of difficulty (alkyl  by mass spectrometry of the reaction solutions.Thus, the presence of excess thiolate and H 2 O triggered the decomposition of 6a and/or I 6a , which ultimately caused the TONs to be low.Nevertheless, this work 136 remains the first and so far the only example of a firstrow transition metal catalyzed hydrolysis of aliphatic and aromatic thiolates at ambient conditions and without the involvement of any additional reagents or cocatalysts.


## CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

Considering the efficiency of the stoichiometric reaction at ambient conditions, the hydrolytic desulfurization of C−S bonds in organosulfur substrates may therefore be proposed as a potential alternative to the model desulfurization reactions reported in the literature.While an appreciable number of reports were available in the literature for the hydrolysis of thioesters, there was no report for the hydrolysis of thiolates under ambient conditions and without the necessary involvement of cocatalysts and/or additional reagents.Sincere efforts from our research group during 2018−2023 were able to fill up this gap with the discovery of a new transition metal mediated hydrolysis reaction for organosulfur substrates, especially thiols/thiolates.The salient features of this new hydrolytic desulfurization process are summarized below:

(1) First-row transition metals in their +II oxidation state, such as Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II), could mediate the hydrolytic cleavage of C−S bonds in thiols/thiolates; while sulfides, thiophenes, and dibenzothiophene could be desulfurized only up to a limited extent with the use of one specific reaction system involving Co(II) and PhBIMP 1− .The hydrolytic C−S bond cleavage was later extended to affect the simultaneous cleavage of C−S (hydrolytic) and S−S (redox) bonds of disulfides as well, which again, was unprecedented.

(2) The hydrolysis of thiols/thiolates proceeds with the initial formation of a binuclear transition metal complex featuring coordinated solvent and/or water, followed by the generation of a binuclear transition metal complex featuring coordinated thiolate and water/hydroxide, which finally releases the hydrolyzed product (alcohol/ phenol) and a binuclear transition metal complex featuring one or two terminal/bridging hydrosulfide.

All the species involved in the reaction have been characterized unambiguously for different metals and ligands.

(3) The efficiency of the first-row transition metals in mediating this hydrolysis reaction generally follows the order Co(II) > Fe(II) > Ni(II) > Zn(II).Among the four binucleating ligands explored in our work, PhBIMP 1− was found to be the most efficient ligand.(4) Finally, the first and the only known catalytic system involving a binuclear Co(II)-hydrosulfide complex with PhBIMP 1− was developed for the catalytic hydrolysis of thiolates at RT, albeit with a low TON of ∼5.

There remain, however, many aspects that need to be studied in the future for further development and fine-tuning of this transition metal mediated hydrolysis reaction.Moreover, while the hydrolysis reaction presented here is indeed a new and exciting reaction strategy for the efficient desulfurization of thiols and other organosulfur substrates, the reaction needs to be significantly improved for its possible industrial use in the future.A few selected aspects that need to be explored for the overall improvement of this hydrolytic desulfurization reaction strategy are summarized below:

(1) The low turnover number observed for the catalytic hydrolysis reaction demands a thorough search for new potential catalysts, which, unlike 6a, may remain stable in the presence of excess thiolates and/or hydrosulfide.In this regard, carboxylate bridged binuclear Co(II) complexes may be tested as potential candidates for mediating the catalytic hydrolysis of thiolates since bridging carboxylates (bidentate, monoanionic) may be less prone toward substitution by thiolates and/or hydrosulfide (monodentate, monoanionic).The catalytic efficiency of such carboxylate bridged binuclear Co(II) complexes may also be improved further by the introduction of electron-donating group(s) on the bridging benzoate and/or on the phenolate unit of the PhBIMP 1− .(2) Binucleating ligands other than those already explored by us and with different combinations of N-and Odonor atoms and having more electron donation capability than the four ligands discussed here need to be explored in order to improve the catalytic efficiency.(3) The hydrolysis reaction may be explored to include more biologically relevant substrates such as sulfurcontaining amino acids (e.g., cysteine, methionine) and small peptides (with sulfur-containing amino acids as building blocks) such as glutathione and others.(4) The stoichiometric and the catalytic hydrolysis reaction presented here are most efficient in highly polar solvents such as DMF, which may not be a good choice for homogeneous desulfurization of sulfur-containing impurities in oil.The catalyst design may be modified to make it soluble in nonpolar solvents such as hexane/ petroleum ether without compromising the stability and efficiency of the catalyst.(5) While this new reaction strategy has been found to be very efficient for the hydrolysis of aliphatic and aromatic thiols, the more difficult HDS substrates such as thiophenes and dibenzothiophene could not be desulfurized efficiently.The next-generation transition metal catalysts for this hydrolytic desulfurization reaction, therefore, need to be more efficient in mediating the desulfurization of thiophenes and dibenzothiophene as well.These proposed studies for the improvement of this newly discovered transition metal mediated hydrolysis of C−S bonds, however, will require careful systematic exploration of reaction conditions, judicious choice for the combination of transition metal with ligands, and innovative catalyst design and are currently in progress in our laboratory.

toward the desulfurization of dibenzothiophene resulted only in the activation of C−S bonds instead of complete extraction of sulfur from dibenzothiophene.Literature reports include Ptmediated hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene in which thiaplatinacycles, [PtL 2 (C,S−C 12 H 8 S)] and [PtL 2 (C,S− C 13 H 10 S)] (L = PEt 3 , PMe 3 ; L 2 = Ph 2 PCH 2 CH 2 PPh 2 ) (generated via oxidative insertion of [Pt 0 Ln] into dibenzothiophene and 4-methyldibenzothiophene), were hydrodesulfurized in toluene at 20 atm pressure of H 2 and 100

the presence of PhBIMP 1− generated both [Fe 2 (PhBIMP)-(CH 3 C(O)S)(MeCN)](BF 4 ) 2 (8b(BF 4 ) 2 ) and 8a(BF 4 ) 2 and hence indicated the superiority of PhBIMP 1− over BPMP 1− in promoting the Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis reaction of bidentate chelating ligands, such as thiocarboxylates, as well.Interestingly, mass spectrometric analysis of a solution obtained by the addition of Fe(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O into a mixture of NaS t Bu, HPhBIMP, and Et 3 N in DMF revealed the generation of the possible reactive intermediate (similar to I proposed in Scheme 3), [Fe 2 (PhBIMP)(S t Bu)(H 2 O)-(DMF) 2 ] 2+ , along with [Fe 2 (PhBIMP)(S t Bu)(DMF) 3 ] 2+ and 8a.These combined results thus strongly supported the proposed mechanism for the transition metal mediated hydrolytic C−S bond cleavage of thiolates shown in Scheme 3. Furthermore, a set of control reactions including experiments involving H 2 18




3 N increased the yields of 8a(BF 4 ) 2 and the alcohol/phenol; (iv) while both Co(II) and Fe(II) could mediate the hydrolysis of a series of aliphatic and aromatic thiolates in the presence of PhBIMP 1− ligand following the same mechanism as shown for Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates in the presence of N-Et-HPTB 1− ligand (Scheme 3), a comparative study clearly established that the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiols/thiolates was much more ef f icient; and (v) Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of C−S bonds is more ef f icient in the presence of PhBIMP 1− compared with that in the presence of N-Et-HPTB 1− , N-CH 2 Py-HPTB 1− , and BPMP 1− .




the reaction of Ni(ClO 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O and HBPMP with NaSR/RSH (R = Me, Et, n Bu, t Bu) in the presence of Et 3 N in DMF for 12 h yielded a mixture of dinickel(II)-thiolate compounds, such as [Ni 2 (BPMP)(μ-SEt)(ClO 4 )](ClO 4 ) (10a(ClO 4 ), and the dinickel(II)-hydrosulfide compound, [Ni 2 (BPMP)(μ-SH)-(DMF) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 (10b(ClO 4 ) 2 ).Compound 10b(ClO 4 ) 2 was therefore isolated as a pure compound by the reaction of Ni(ClO 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O and HBPMP with NaS t Bu for 6 days in the presence of additional H 2 O (5% v/v) and Et 3 N in DMF, while the generation of t BuOH was identified and quantified by GC-MS.A dinickel(II)-solvento compound, [Ni 2 (BPMP)-(MeOH) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 3 (10c(ClO 4 ) 3 ), was also isolated and characterized, which represented the first step of the Ni(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates, and indeed further reaction of 10c(ClO 4 ) 3 with NaS t Bu in the presence of H 2 O (5%) in DMF for 6 days allowed the isolation of 10b(ClO 4 ) 2 along with the generation of t BuOH.However, Ni(II) could not mediate the hydrolysis of PhC(O)SH and instead yielded the compound [Ni 2 (BPMP)(SC(O)Ph) 2 ](ClO 4 ) (10d(ClO 4 )).Considering the known difficulty for the hydrolysis of aromatic thiolates compared with the easier hydrolysis of aliphatic thiolates, the desired dinickel(II) compound featuring both a coordinated thiolate and a water molecule, [Ni 2 (BPMP)(SPh)(DMF)(MeOH)(H 2 O)](ClO 4 ) 2 (10e(ClO 4 ) 2 ), was therefore synthesized by either the reaction of Ni(ClO 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O and HBPMP with NaSPh in DMF for 1 h or by the reaction of 10c(ClO 4 ) 3 with NaSPh for 1 h.Compound 10e(ClO 4 ) 2 (Scheme 6) featured a dinickel(II) compound with a coordinated thiolate and a coordinated H 2 O molecule.Moreover, treatment of 10e(ClO 4 ) 2 with Et 3 N and H 2 O (5% v/v) in DMF for 6 days indeed allowed the generation of PhOH and 10b(ClO 4 ) 2 via the hydrolysis of the coordinated PhS − .Compound 10e (ClO 4 ) 2 therefore satisfied the structural (featuring coordinated thiolate and H 2 O) and f unctional (generation of the hydrolyzed product) criteria of the intermediate (I) which was proposed to precede the transition metal mediated hydrolysis of thiolates.

) Å (Co1) and 2.358(1) Å (Co2) while the DMF is coordinated to the Co(II) center which had the longer Co-SH distance (Co1).It was anticipated that an incoming thiolate (RS − ) and an H 2 O molecule may replace the coordinated DMF to generate an unstable species (such as I 6a ) in solution, which may then facilitate the hydrolysis of the coordinated thiolate (Scheme 8).The proposed catalytic cycle (Scheme 8) thus might involve the reaction of 6a with thiolate and H 2 O to generate the active intermediate complex, [Co 2 (PhBIMP)(μ-SH)(RS)(H 2 O)] 1+ (I 6a ) in solution, which, in turn, might release the hydrolyzed products, namely, the corresponding alcohol/phenol and hydrosulfide (HS − ), and thus might regenerate 6a.Generation of I 6a was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of reaction solutions involving 6a, H 2 O, and a series of thiolates (RS − : R = t Bu, CH 2 (CH 2 ) 4 CH 3 , CH 2 Ph, 2,6-Me-C 6 H 3 , 2,4-Me-C 6 H 3 , and 3-Br-C 6 H 4 Ph).Involvement of an active intermediate (of the type I 6a ) was also supported by kinetic studies for the reaction of 6a with varying equivalents of NaSCH 2 Ph (1:NaSCH 2 Ph = 1:n; n = 2, 3, 4, 5) which showed that the k obs values (5.9−7.6 × 10 −4 min −1
