Session: P-81. UTIsBackground. Extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) enzymes are plasmid-mediated, rapidly emerging and complex thereby posing a major therapeutic challenge in the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in community and hospital settings. In 2017, there were an estimated 197,400 cases of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales among hospitalized patients and 9,100 estimated deaths in the United States.Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a publicly accessible National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from October 2015 to December 2017. Adult patients (age >/= 18 years old) with UTI as a principal diagnosis were included. SAS 9.4 was used for univariate and multivariate linear. Logistic regression statistical analyses were used to compare mean age at the time of admission, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, hospitalization costs, and Elixhauser comorbidity indices.Results. Of the total 5,776,156 patients included in the study, 52,765 patients had ESBL-enzyme induced UTIs. 66% were females and 34% were males. 63.3% were Caucasian, 11.6% were African-American, 18.8% were Hispanic, and 4.4% were Asian or Pacific Islander. The most common comorbidities were renal failure (22.8%), diabetes mellitus with complications (20.8%), congestive heart failure (20.5%), chronic lung disease (20.0%), neurological diseases (17.8%), obesity (12.6%), paralysis (12.5%), and depression (11.5%). In-hospital mortality was 2.5% (p< 0.0001), which was most likely due to the underlying co-morbidities. In patients without ESBL-enzyme induced UTIs, average length of stay was 7.8±8.5 days, and economic burden was $16,166.8 ± $21,183.5 USD. In comparison, patients with ESBL-enzyme induced UTIs had in-hospital mortality of 3.9%, average length of stay of 7.0 ± 9.7 days, and economic burden of $15,793.3 ± $29,268.6 USD.ESBL and UTI data analysis image 1 ESBL and UTI data analysis image 2Conclusion.We found that ESBL-enzyme-producing UTIs have statistically significant prolonged length of stay and economic burden, though in hospital mortality rate is low. This could be due to judicious use of antimicrobial therapy. There is a need for further research, as well as increased antimicrobial stewardship for UTIs, a globally recognized major cause of nosocomial acquired infections.Session: P-81. UTIsBackground. Shorter courses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics for young infants with urinary tract infection (UTI) have myriad advantages. As practice shifts toward shorter IV treatment course, this study aimed to determine the safety of early IV-to-oral antibiotic switch, and identify risk factors for bacteraemia with UTI.Methods. Retrospective audit of infants aged ≤90 days with a positive urine culture at a quaternary paediatric hospital over four years (2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020). Data were collected from the hospital electronic medical record and laboratory information system. Short-course IV antibiotic duration was defined as < 48 hours for nonbacteraemic UTI and < 7 days for bacteraemic UTI. Multivariate analysis was used to determine patient factors predicting bacteraemia.Results. Among 427 infants with nonbacteraemic UTI, 257 (60.2%) were treated for < 48 hours. Clinicians prescribed shorter IV courses to infants who were female, aged >30 days, afebrile, and those without bacteraemia or cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Treatment failure (30-day UTI recurrence) occurred in 6/451 (1.3%) infants. All had nonbacteraemic UTI and only one received < 48 hours of IV antibiotics. None had serious complications (bacteraemia, meningitis, death). Follow-up audiology was performed in 21/31 (68%) infants with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and one had sensorineural hearing loss. Bacteraemia occurred in 24/451 (5.3%) infants, with 10 receiving < 7 days IV antibiotics with no treatment failure, meningitis or death. Fever and pyelonephritis were independent predictors of bacteraemia.Conclusion.Regardless of index treatment setting, approximately 40% of all cUTI patients required ≥4 antibiotic therapy and almost half with receive an IV antibiotic in the outpatient setting in the 12-months post index date.Disclosures.
