Self-reported throat symptoms in Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and hypermobility spectrum disorders: A cross-sectional survey study
F7C74AB437846177217D1ACCB3A733AA10.1002/lio2.1120Received: 17 March 2023 Revised: 15 June 2023 Accepted: 22 June 2023
Objectives: This study identified the frequency and severity of dysphagia, dysphonia, and laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms in people with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) or hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) and explored differences between diagnostic groups.Methods: Participants were recruited via non-probability convenience sampling.Information was gathered via online survey, including the Reflux Symptom Index

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT), characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and tissue fragility and there are 13 distinct subtypes. 1permobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common subtype, likely representing >90% of cases, with a prevalence presumed at around 1/3500. 2 EDS presents with many comorbidities including pain, fatigue, anxiety, gastro-intestinal issues, autonomic dysfunction, temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD), and dental issues. 3Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) are joint hypermobility related conditions that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for hEDS or any other HDCT.Recent studies of EDS and HSD demonstrated that, between them, the prevalence of the above comorbidities is similar. 4,5e diagnosis of EDS pre 2017 would have been by the Villefranche criteria, 6 and post 2017 by the International Criteria, 1 which involve looking for various signs of connective tissue pathology including tissue laxity and fragility.In addition, many comorbidities are seen that are not in the diagnostic criteria and include inflammation for example, mast cell activation, GERD, and neuropathy among others.

To our knowledge, there are two published quantitative studies of dysphagia and dysphonia in EDS to date.A survey-based study of people with EDS identified dysphagia in 39% of respondents and dysphonia symptoms in 27% of respondents. 7][10] Gastro-intestinal symptoms in EDS have been well documented with a study finding gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) reported in 68.7% of their patients. 11Given the relationship between GORD and LPR, it is reasonable to consider whether LPR may also be a symptom of EDS, which may affect swallowing and voicing.

Further research into throat symptoms of EDS and HSD could inform assessment and treatment for this population.This study aimed to identify the frequency and severity of throat symptoms (i.e., dysphonia, dysphagia, and LPR/upper airway inflammation) in this population.


# | MATERIALS AND METHODS

This was a cross-sectional observational study.Information was gathered via an online survey using Qualtrics (Provo, UT).Participants who reported a diagnosis of EDS or HSD, aged 18 or over, and able to complete the survey in English were included.Participants were recruited via non-probability snowball sampling (a convenience sample).They were primarily recruited via EDS and hypermobility organizations: the Ehlers-Danlos Society, Ehlers-Danlos Support UK, and the Hypermobility Syndromes Association.These organizations advertised the study on social media, on their websites, and via e-newsletter.The researcher also advertised the study on Twitter.

Ethical approval was obtained from City, University of London (ref.

ETH2021-0526).The survey could be completed from 11th February-9th May 2021 inclusive, after completing an informed consent form, either online or by completing a pdf/printed copy of the survey and returning it via email or post.


## | Measures

Clinical data were gathered including age, country of residence, gender, education level, employment status, and type of EDS.The survey included patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) that are routinely used to identify the presence and severity of LPR, dysphagia and dysphonia: the Reflux Symptom Index, 12 the Eating Assessment Tool, 13 and the Voice Handicap Index. 14The RSI measure was used with caution as it should be noted that it measures severity of symptoms associated with upper airway inflammation including but not exclusive to those of LPR.With this in mind, a high RSI score in isolation does not determine the presence of LPR.The VHI consists of three subscales, measuring the Emotional (VHI-E), Functional (VHI-F), and Physical (VHI-P) impact of dysphonia.Participants were also asked if they had been diagnosed with any of four ENT conditions that had clinically been associated with EDS: TMJ, tracheomalacia/tracheostenosis, Eagle syndrome, and atlanto-axial spine subluxation (AAS).

According to authors of the measures, an RSI score of 13 or above may indicate significant LPR 12 and an EAT-10 score of 3 or above may indicate difficulties swallowing efficiently and safely, 13 so these figures were used as threshold scores respectively.


## | Statistical/analytical strategy

The frequency and impact of dysphonia (based on VHI score), frequency and severity of LPR (based on RSI score) and frequency and severity of dysphagia (based on EAT-10 score) symptoms in participants were recorded using descriptive statistics.For categorical data (EDS/HSD diagnosis, gender, residing country, education level, employment, and diagnosis of ENT conditions) frequency and percentages were utilized.For continuous scales (age, RSI, VHI, EAT-10), mean scores and standard deviations (SD) were reported.Frequency and percentages and one-sample t-tests were also utilized to report cases that met PROM thresholds outlined in Table 1.

Comorbidity differences (ENT diagnoses) were explored using chi-squared (χ 2 ) tests using Cramer's phi (ϕ) as a measure of association.Group differences between RSI scores, EAT-10 scores, VHI scores were explored using ANOVAs, based on both total scores and at item (individual question) level.Post hoc tests (Tukey) were performed to identify significant differences between groups.Partial eta squared (η p 2 ) was used to measure overall effect size (ES) and Hedge's g was calculated to measure ES between two groups at a time.Statistical significance was measured at the p < .01level.Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS v28 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).A sample size calculation in G*Power 3 15 indicated that to find a medium effect size (f = 0.25) difference between three groups (hEDS, HSD, and cEDS), at alpha .01 and power 90%, within an ANOVA, a sample size of 285 would be required (95 per group).


# | RESULTS


## | Demographics

There were 1620 participants who met the inclusion criteria.1405 had a VHI score of 31-60 (indicating a moderate impact), and 14.6% had a VHI score of 61-120 (indicating a severe impact caused by dysphonia).The VHI-E mean score was the lowest of the three subscales, followed by the VHI-F and the VHI-P mean score (Table 2).A one sample t-test showed that the cohort's mean VHI score of 31.99 (SD = 24.36) is significantly lower than the VHI threshold score of 61 to indicate a severe impact, t(1531) = À46.6,p < .001.Their mean VHI score suggested that, overall, the cohort experience a mild to moderate impact of the dysphonia with a wide distribution of scores (Table 2).

### | Co-morbidity differences

The most common ENT comorbidity was TMJD.There was a significant difference in number of people diagnosed with TMJD (χ 2 (2) = 25.839;p < .001),occurring most frequently in the hEDS group (57.3%), followed by the cEDS group (45.1%) and the HSD group (40.3%) with a moderate strength of association (ϕ = 0.135).

There was a significant difference in number of people diagnosed with AAS, (χ 2 (2) = 12.403; p = .002)occurring most frequently in the HSD group (19.6%), followed by the hEDS group (10%) and the cEDS group (5%) with a weak strength of association (ϕ = .093All three group (cEDS, hEDS, and HSD) mean RSI scores were markedly higher than the threshold of 13, with wide distributions of scores (Table 4).There was a significant difference in RSI mean score with the hEDS group scoring highest, followed by the cEDS group, and the HSD group with a small ES (η p 2 = 0.012).Post hoc comparisons revealed the hEDS group scored significantly higher than the HSD group with a small ES ( g = 0.29).Statistics are in Table 4. On item level analysis, there were significant differences in RSI-2 "clearing your throat" (p = .002),RSI-4 "difficulty swallowing food, liquids or pills" ( p < .001),and RSI-6 "breathing difficulties or choking episodes" (p = .001),scores with post hoc tests revealing significantly higher scores in hEDS than HSD with a small ES ( g = 0.18-0.29).There were also significant differences in RSI-9 score although no significance was revealed in post hoc comparisons.There were no significant T A B L E 3 Group differences in additional ear, nose, and throat-related diagnosis.thorough history, examination and testing 22 and should not be used in isolation to diagnose LPR.It is likely that the RSI scores represent a general marker of throat health, rather than being completely specific for extra-esophageal reflux.To a lesser extent, similar caveats can be applied to the VHI and the EAT-10 systems too.


# | CONCLUSION

People with EDS/HSD experience symptoms of acid reflux, dysphagia and dysphonia to varying degrees with symptoms experienced more severely in hEDS than HSD.Awareness of the impact of EDS/HSD on throat symptoms will enable health care practitioners to anticipate throat symptoms more readily in this population and provide individualized and more effective management plans for their patients.These findings may also act as a guide toward better diagnostic criteria of hEDS and HSD throat symptoms in future.

study revealed that people with EDS and HSD experience symptoms of LPR/upper-airway inflammation, dysphagia, and dysphonia to varying degrees.There were subtle but distinct significant differences in severity of throat symptoms between hEDS and HSD.The EDS/HSD cohort's mean RSI score of 22.95 (SD 9.0) indicates that LPR-like symptoms are common in people with EDS/HSD.Their mean score is substantially higher than that of 91 asymptomatic subjects in a study by Chen et al., which was 2.24 (SD 2.34).16In drawing comparisons between diagnostic groups, the hEDS group's significantly higher mean RSI total score than the HSD group suggests that, whereas both groups experience LPR-like symptoms to a degree, they are experienced more severely in people with hEDS.Item level analyses indicated the hEDS group displayed significantly higher scores on RSI items, "clearing your throat," "difficulty swallowing food, liquids or pills," and "breathing difficulties or choking episodes."The EAT-10 score findings suggest that people with EDS/HSD experience more severe swallowing difficulties than the non-dysphagic population.Compared to normative data,13the EDS/HSD cohort's mean EAT-10 score of 11.91 (SD 9.65) was substantially higher than "healthy" individuals and closest to those experiencing reflux and dysphonia.In drawing comparisons between hEDS, cEDS and HSD, significant differences were only found between the hEDS group and the HSD group, with the hEDS group displaying significantly higher mean scores on their overall EAT-10 total scores and on all 10 EAT-10 items.This suggests that, whereas both groups experience swallowing difficulties to a degree, they are experienced more severely in people with hEDS.The VHI scores showed that people with EDS/HSD experience dysphonia to varying degrees.The cohort's mean VHI score at 31.99 (SD 24.36) is lower than that found in a study of 109 people with functional dysphonia, which was 71.17It is also lower than the mean score found by Bouwers and Dikkers18in people with benign voice disorders prior to treatment at 48.9 (SD 20.9) but substantially higher than their control group at 3.6 (SD 3.8).Although there is a strong association between anxiety disorders and hEDS/HSD,19the mean VHI subscale scores (VHI-E, VHI-F, and VHI-P) indicated that people with EDS/HSD are impacted by voice difficulties on a more physical level than on a functional or emotional one.There were no significant differences in mean VHI score between groups.However, the significant difference between hEDS and HSD on the item, "My voice is creaky and dry," suggests that oropharyngeal dryness is experienced more frequently in people with hEDS than HSD.The voice difficulties experienced by participants could be explained by the recently reported multifactorial causes of dysphonia in EDS/HSD that indicate, (i) the incoordination or hypermobility of the vocal cords, (ii) reduced mobility of the cricoarytenoid joint, and(iii) loss of mucosal wave due to changes in the collagen contributing to the fine surface vibration of the vocal folds (cords), are possible mechanisms by which one's voice may be affected.20the largest study of its kind in terms of exploring throat symptoms of EDS/HSD and self-management strategies, this work provides a unique and valuable contribution and has generated interest from leading health care practitioners specializing in EDS and HSD.Prior to this study, throat symptoms of EDS/HSD have not been well reported or characterized.20cruitment of participants was highly successful for the cEDS, hEDS, and HSD groups, resulting in a large sample and strong reliability of results for these groups as well as allowing comparisons to be drawn between them.The small sample size obtained for the rarer types of EDS is likely to reflect the rarity of these conditions, the prevalence of which is not known.21The vast disparity in numbers of female to male participants meant that gender comparisons were not appropriate.However, the ratio of female to male is typical of EDS specialty clinics (author's experience [AJH]).
