ATCA SURVEY OF AMMONIA IN THE GALACTIC CENTER: THE TEMPERATURES OF DENSE GAS CLUMPS BETWEEN SGR A* AND SGR B2

We present a large-scale, interferometric survey of ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) toward the Galactic Center observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The survey covers ∆ℓ ∼ 1 • (∼ 150 pc at an assumed distance of 8.5 kpc) and ∆b ∼ 0.2 • (∼ 30 pc) which spans the region between the supermassive black hole Sgr A* and the massive star forming region Sgr B2. The resolution is ∼ 20 ′′ (∼ 0.8 pc) and emission at scales 2 ′ ( 3.2 pc) is filtered out due to missing interferometric short spacings. Consequently, the data represent the denser, compact clouds and disregards the large scale, diffuse gas. Many of the clumps align with the 100 pc dust ring and mostly anti-correlate with 1.2 cm continuum emission. We present a kinetic temperature map of the dense gas. The temperature distribution peaks at ∼ 38 K with a width at half maximum between 18 K and 61 K (measurements sensitive within T kin ∼ 10 − 80 K). Larger clumps are on average warmer than smaller clumps which suggests internal heating sources. Our observations indicate that the circumnuclear disk ∼ 1.5 pc around Sgr A* is supplied with gas by the 20 kms molecular cloud. This gas is substantially cooler than gas ∼ 3 − 15 pc away from Sgr A*. We find a strong temperature gradient across Sgr B2. Ammonia column densities correlate well with SCUBA 850 µm fluxes, but the relation is shifted from the origin, which may indicate a requirement for a minimum amount of dust to form and shield ammonia. Around the Arches and Quintuplet clusters we find shell morphologies with UV-influenced gas in their centers, followed by ammonia and radio continuum layers.

Galactic gravitational potential and exhibits some of the most complex and energetic processes in our Milky Way. The bar forces gas from the disk to be funneled to the center via x 1 and x 2 orbits (e.g. Stark et al. 2004;Kim et al. 2011). Within the bar potential, most of the molecular gas resides in a ∼ 500 pc region dubbed the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; e.g. Morris & Serabyn 1996;Oka et al. 1998;Jones et al. 2012) and can be considered the region where x 2 orbits dominate (e.g. Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2006). The cloud trajectories in the bar potential are self-intersecting which results in a large number of cloud-cloud collisions. The collisions induce shocks that dominate the physical and chemical properties of the interstellar matter in the region, in particular the molecular gas. The shocks inject turbulence into the gas and are a potential heating source. Turbulence is measured by the increased linewidths of the molecular gas in the Galactic Center region, with values typically of tens of km s −1 whereas giant molecular clouds in the disk of the Milky Way exhibit linewidths of only a few km s −1 .

Cloud-cloud collisions also influence the properties of star formation in the region. Studies (e.g. Alexander et al. 2007; Bartko et al. 2010;Lu et al. 2013) find that the initial mass function in the central parts of the Galactic Center region is skewed toward massive stars more than elsewhere in the Local Universe. In addition, the sheer amount and density of molecular material (about a few per cent, or a few 10 7 M ⊙ , of all molecular gas in the Milky Way is concentrated in about 0.01% of the volume) coupled with a star formation rate of ∼ 0.1 M ⊙ yr −1 (e.g. Crocker et al. 2011) produces a large number of high mass stars. Through stellar evolution, they inject mechanical power of ∼ 10 40 erg s −1 in the form of strong stellar winds and supernovae, and return about 0.02 M ⊙ of material back to the ISM (for an overview, see Crocker et al. 2011). A dramatic effect of these energy sources might be the ∼ 10 deg sized Fermi bubbles that extend perpendicular to the Galactic disk far into the Galaxy's halo (e.g. Su et al. 2010;Crocker et al. 2011;Carretti et al. 2013). The high density and short lifetimes of the massive stars also produce many compact, energetic objects and the CMZ is under the influence of a large flux of UV and X-ray photons as well as cosmic rays that can penetrate the molecular gas. Some of these sources influence gas locally, others influence gas on larger scales. Overall, however, the state of the gas in the CMZ is dominated by shock physics (e.g. Martín-Pintado et al. 2000;Martín et al. 2008;Protheroe et al. 2008;Amo-Baladrón et al. 2009).

Given all local and global influences, it is important to understand how star formation can proceed under these conditions. The molecular gas defines the site and the material for star formation and it is an important goal to directly measure the parameters of the molecular gas such as temperature, density, turbulence, ionization fraction and magnetic field penetration. In this paper we concentrate on the temperature of the gas. Our goal is to produce a temperature map of the Galactic Center gas, in particular of the denser gas phase on parsec scales that match the size of the individual star formation locations. A comparison of the temperatures with nearby sources, and a correlation with the cloud properties will allow us to derive the most likely heating sources of the gas, and whether they are external or internal to the gas clouds.

We decide to use ammonia as a temperature tracer. Ammonia (NH 3 ) has a peculiar structure of a prolate symmetric top, a tetrahedron with a nitrogen atom in one corner and three hydrogen atoms in the remaining corners. The nitrogen atom can tunnel through the plane defined by the three hydrogen atoms. This possibility removes the degeneracy of the symmetric top levels (J,K) at J > 0, which splits the energy levels into doublets. Transitions between those levels can be measured as 'inversion lines'. The inversion line frequencies directly depend on the rotational states of the molecule. By measuring the intensity of an inversion line one can thus derive the number of NH 3 molecules a the given rotational state. The population interchange between different K ladders is solely governed by collisions, and all (J > K,K) states decay fast into the metastable J = K levels. The distribution of all (J,J) states is thus a result of the energetics of the collisions, and is simply described by a Boltzmann distribution at a temperature T . Ammonia is thus an excellent thermometer.

In the following we present interferometric observations of the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) transitions across a large fraction in the CMZ which we use to construct a temperature map of the clumped gas in the region at pc size resolution. The observations and data reduction are described in Sect. 2, followed by our results in Sect. 3. A discussion of the morphology, kinematics, temperature structure of the gas clumps and their relation to other Galactic Center objects are presented in Sect. 4, followed by a summary in Sect. 5.


## OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION


### General Setup

We observed the Galactic Center during 8 nights on 2005 August 3-8, 10, and 12 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA 1 , project id: C 1322) with 5 antennas in the most compact, hybrid H 75 array configuration (baselines in the range of 31 to 89 m). Antenna CA 06 was also used but, due to the long baselines to the rest of the array (∼ 4.5 km), it is down-weighted and does not contribute substantially to the surface brightness sensitivity.

The K-band system at the ATCA was tuned to observe both polarizations at a center frequency of 23.708 GHz with a bandwidth of 64 MHz split into 128 channels. This setup was chosen to observe both, the NH 3 (1,1) (rest frequency: 23.6945GHz) and (2,2) (rest frequency: 23.7226 GHz) lines simultaneously within the same band (when adjusting for the systemic velocity of the Galactic Center and the observatory velocity at the time of the observations). This resulted in a velocity resolution of ∼ 6.3 km s −1 at a total Local Standard of Rest (LSR) velocity range of -180 to +165 km s −1 common to both lines.

Given that the shortest baseline is 31 m, the array is only sensitive to emission less than ∼ 1.3 ′ , which corresponds to about half the primary beam of the observations (∼ 2.4 ′ ).


### Mosaicking Technique

Our survey covers an area of 0.2 degree 2 , 1 • in Galactic longitude (−0.2 • ℓ 0.8 • ) and 0.2 • in Galactic latitude (−0.13 • b 0.07 • ), i.e., it is centered on ℓ = 0.3 • and b = 0.03 • . At the assumed distance of the Galactic Center, 8.5 kpc, the covered area corresponds to widths of ∼ 148 pc in ℓ and ∼ 30 pc in b, ∼ 4440 pc 2 in total.

A hexagonal, fully-sampled pointing pattern was used to cover the observed area (primary K-band beam of the ATCA: ∼ 2. ′ 4), 840 pointings in total. To obtain the most uniform uv-coverage we set up the following mosaicking strategy: The field was split up into 6 different, 1 The Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia Telescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO. equal sized sub-regions along Galactic longitude, with 140 pointing centers each. In addition, each sub-region was furthermore split up into two different scans, each of which covers half (i.e. 70 pointings) of the area: an ℓ scan along Galactic longitude and a b scan along Galactic latitude (see Fig. 1). Scans of the fields were started at different sidereal times during the 8 nights making sure that each scan and field, i.e. the entire 840 pointings of the survey, are covered at least once per night and in rare occasions twice. The typical uv-coverage of a single pointing is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. Note, however, that due to our distinct ℓ and b scan driving scheme and the overlaps of the primary beams in the hexagonal pattern, the actual uv-coverage at any position on the map is better.

Each pointing has an integration time of ∼ 30 s per night, accumulating to ∼ 4 min in total. Time lost between the pointings due to acceleration and deceleration of the ATCA dishes for our survey amounts to about a second and is therefore negligible.


### Calibration

Flux calibration was performed using daily observations of the ATCA standard calibrator PKS 1934-638. The ∼ 1.3 Jy bright phase (complex gain) calibrator PKS 1710-269 was observed twice for 2 min each ℓ or b scan, i.e. every ∼ 35 min (see Sect. 2.2). PKS 1710-269 is located at the Galactic coordinates ℓ = 357.73044774 • , b = 6.99364372 • and can be considered to be a point source for this array configuration and frequency. The same source was used to update the pointing of the individual ATCA antennas every ∼ 1.5 hours with typical corrections of ∼ 5 ′′ . Antenna-based bandpasses were determined by daily ∼ 10 min integrations on PKS 1255-053 (also known as 3C279), which has a flux of ∼ 15 Jy in K-band. We estimate the absolute flux uncertainty to ∼ 15 %. Note, however, that both ammonia lines were observed in the same band. Relative flux values and resulting parameters such as the temperature (Sect. 4.4) are therefore much more accurate.

All data reduction steps were performed with the MIRIAD software package (Sault et al. 1995). All data were first corrected for atmospheric opacity (task atlod with option opcorr) and edited for corrupt visibilities and shadowed antennas. Furthermore, the first seven and last 3 edge channels were discarded. The task mfcal was used to obtain bandpass and complex gain solutions and gpboot performed absolute flux calibration. This solution was bootstrapped to the complex gain calibrator (and eventually to the data) when the latter was at the same elevation as the flux calibrator PKS 1934-638. The 1.2 cm radio continuum was separated from the uv data using line-free channels at either end of the spectra and in between the NH 3 (1,1) and (2,2) lines (task uvlin).


### Imaging

The task invert was used to Fourier transform the visibilities into a combined mosaic image of all pointings, including the corrections for the primary beam shapes. During that step the visibilities were weighted in the natural scheme as well as by the inverse of their noise variance. Eventually the data were deconvolved with the maximum entropy algorithm as implemented in mosmem. A first step comprised a non-restricted 30 iteration run of mosmem across the mosaic, followed by a restoration of the cube (task restor). This cube, however, still showed considerable sidelobe structure. The results improved substantially after using the result from the first application of mosmem, convolving it to about twice the natural beam size, and blanking all values below 100 mJy beam −1 per channel, in the following we call this cube the 'mask'. Eventually, the original data set was deconvolved again, but we forced mosmem to only act on those pixels where the mask was non-blank. The restoration process of the resulting new deconvolved model with the residuals of the deconvolution process did eventually preserve the fluxes in the maps. The effects of the sidelobes on the data, however, were drastically reduced. We checked the fluxes of the maximum entropy deconvolution with the more familiar CLEAN algorithm (task mossdi) and found that while the fluxes are comparable, the extended emission was much better reproduced with mosmem.

The final data have a beam size of ∼ 26. ′′ 2 × 16. ′′ 8, with a position angle of −70 • , corresponding to a physical resolution in the Galactic Center of ∼ 1.1 pc ×0.7 pc. The pixel size of the data was chosen to be 4 ′′ . The flux rms noise per channel is ∼ 7 mJy beam −1 which corresponds to an rms brightness of ∼ 35 mK.

Eventually, the total data cube was split into cubes that comprise only the NH 3 (1,1) or the NH 3 (2,2) inversion lines.


## RESULTS


### Radio Continuum

Using the line-free channels from our data, we are also able to construct a 1.2 cm continuum map which is displayed in Fig. 2(b). The dynamic range across all pointings of the mosaic is of order 10 4 with the brightest sources toward Sgr A* at T mb = 30.5 K (with some confusion from close-by sources), and Sgr B2 (M) and (N) with main beam brightness temperatures of 48.5 K and 27.9 K, respectively. The 'mini-spiral' associated with Sgr A* is also visible as is the Sgr B1 region at (ℓ, b) ≈ (0.49 • , −0.06 • ). Some of the most striking features are the presence of the non-thermal radio arcs along Galactic longitudes of ℓ ∼ 0.18 • . Their fluxes increase from high to low latitudes from ∼ 0.2 to ∼ 0.6 K with the brightest, ∼ 1.4 K spots in the 'pistol' or 'sickle' region at (ℓ, b) = (0.189 • , −0.051 • ) (see Fig. 2; for a spectral index analysis, see Lang et al. 1999). The thin, unresolved vertical filaments appear to be connected in projection to the thermal, arched filaments that start at b ≈ 0.07 and extend to (ℓ, b) ≈ (0.071 • , −0.001 • ). Between that position and the Sgr A* region, a number of scattered radio continuum point sources are detected in the map. Overall, the 1.2 cm ATCA radio continuum map exhibits a very similar morphology when compared to the 21 cm and 90 cm Very Large Array maps presented by Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2004), Anantharamaiah et al. (1991), and Nord et al. (2004). The low frequency maps, however, also contain a number of finer, arcminute long filaments, perpendicular to the plane, sometimes called non-thermal radio filaments (NRFs) or threads, that we do not detect in our 1.2 cm data.


### Sample Spectra

In Fig 3 we show spectra from the ammonia datacubes at different positions in the CMZ. The measured parameters of Gaussian fits to the spectra are listed in Table 1 and derived values in Table 2. For better orientation, we also indicate the area that the positions belong to in Table 2. Ammonia (1,1) peak brightness temperatures are typically around ∼ 1 K with values of up to ∼ 17 K. NH 3 (2,2) peak temperatures are typically ∼ 10% weaker than those of the (1,1) line. FWHM widths of the sample spectra are 20-40 km s −1 . Some of the positions show multiple ammonia components and are listed with "a" and "b" appendices in the tables. Ammonia has hyperfine structure which needs to be distinguished from multiple gas components and also adds to the FWHM. An analysis is presented in Sect. 3.6.

Absorption is observed toward the star forming regions Sgr B2 (N) at position 32, Sgr B2 (M) at position 29, and the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at position 7. The absorption spectra are rather complex and contain all components along the lines of sight from the earth to the CMZ.


### Total Intensity

The integrated ammonia (1,1) intensity map is shown in Fig. 2. In this representation, the velocity integrated brightness temperature was converted NH 3 (1,1) column densities. The upper level columns of the inversion line can be derived via the following relation: (Henkel et al. 2000) where N u is given in units of cm −2 , the frequency ν in GHz, the main beam brightness temperature T mb in K, and the velocity v in km s −1 . The upper and lower levels of each inversion line are almost evenly populated due to the small energy difference. We therefore double each upper level population to arrive at the total, upper and lower population for each line. The dynamic range of the map spans more than 2 orders of magnitude with the Sgr B2 molecular cloud being exceptionally bright. In fact, the interferometric map around Sgr B2 shows a very steep gradient with a decline in brightness by a factor of ∼ 30 within a radius of only 5 pc (for a more detailed discussion of the profile see Protheroe et al. 2008). Part of the steep decline, however, might be due to the missing short spacings which filters out very extended emission (Sect. 2). Single dish maps (e.g. Guesten et al. 1981;Handa et al. 2006;Purcell et al. 2012) show extremely bright and extended emission, so the short spacing filtering effect is substantial in this region and we detect only the local peaks of the emission. Toward the positions of Sgr B2 (M) and (N) at (0.667 • , −0.036 • ) and (0.680 • , −0.029 • ), respectively, the ultra-compact H ii regions (see also Fig. 2[b]) are bright enough in the radio continuum to yield ammonia absorption instead of emission. This explains the two 'holes' on top of this region.
N u (J, K) = 7.77 × 10 13 ν J(J + 1) K 2 T mb dv (1)
Very striking features are the two 'molecular arcs' in between Sgr B2 and a Galactic longitude of ∼ 0.2 • . The molecular arcs appear to be symmetric with the symmetry axis slightly below the zero Galactic latitude line at b ∼ −0.02 • ; one arc spanning up to b ∼ 0.06 • and the other up to b ∼ −0.09 • (outlined by a dashed and dotted line in Fig. 4). If they are coherent features, they have lengths of ∼ 0.5 • which corresponds to ∼ 75 pc. They are mostly coincident with the dusty ring detected as a cold structure in Herschel temperature maps by Molinari et al. (2011) (see also Sect. 4.3). One of the brightest clumps being part of the molecular arcs is the 'brick' G0.253+0.016 at ∼ (0.253 • , 0.016 • ). It is a high density, compact molecular clump with an integrated brightness temperature of ∼ 230 K km s −1 that could be the formation site of a massive star cluster (e.g. Longmore et al. 2012).

The sightline toward Sgr A* is relatively weak with a temperature-velocity integral of ∼ 11.7 K km s −1 . At distances of ∼ 30 ′′ from Sgr A* however, we do see surrounding emission from the circumnuclear disk (CND), a feature that is also prominent in lines of other molecules such as HCN (Christopher et al. 2005;Montero-Castaño et al. 2009, see Sect. 4.6 for details).

Toward negative Galactic longitudes, the 20 km s −1 cloud at (ℓ, b) ∼ (−0.1, −0.08) is one of the strongest features in our map and it splits into three almost parallel filaments with lengths of ∼ 0.1 • or ∼ 15 pc. The two at higher b are with 110-130 K km s −1 very similar in integrated brightness, whereas the one at lower b is somewhat weaker with 80-100 K km s −1 .

In between the 20 km s −1 cloud and the molecular arcs is the region where the massive Arches and Quintuplet clusters reside (see Sect. 4.5). In that part of the CMZ, the molecular arcs intersect in projection, giving way to a somewhat rounder, shell-like structure. This structure is located near to a large cloud that is elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane in the vicinity of the nonthermal radio continuum arc (Sect. 3.1). From there, two molecular features are visible that form a ">" shape and merge close to the 20 km s −1 cloud.


### Global Velocity Structure

Binning three channels to velocity widths of ∼ 19 km s −1 , the channel maps of the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) inversion line emission are displayed in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. As expected, the NH 3 (2,2) emission is generally somewhat fainter but very similar in structure to the (1,1) emission. Given the dynamic range of the data (see Sect. 3.3), we display the maps in logarithmic units. At low velocities, the tip of the 20 km s −1 cloud as well as the molecular arc at b > 0 • are visible (see also Fig. 2). The southern molecular arc breaks up into clouds at velocities ∼ 20 km s −1 and ∼ 80 km s −1 and is therefore not as coherent in velocity space as the northern one. It is somewhat surprising that this arc does not have many cloud components in the intermediate velocity range at ∼ 50 km s −1 . The molecular gas at (ℓ < 0 • , b > 0 • ) is in the velocity range of 50 − 100 km s −1 with an additional component at ∼ −60 to −40 km s −1 . The intensityweighted velocity map (moment 1; Fig. 4) indicates a very similar velocity structure in the (ℓ < 0 • , b > 0 • ) region and the arc structure at negative b values between Sgr A* and Sgr B2. Note that emission at negative velocities is relatively weak and thus the intensity-weighted velocity map displayed in Fig. 4(b) is biased toward larger values.

In Fig. 7 we show a position-velocity map of the entire data cube. The greyscale is the peak intensity determined along b. In this plot the velocity difference between the different molecular arcs becomes apparent again, with a maximum separation of ∼ 100 km s −1 and an indication that the tips of the arcs arrive at similar velocities after a smooth velocity difference decrease.

The mean velocity of Sgr B2 is about ∼ 70 km s −1 and absorption of ammonia toward Sgr A* is at ∼ 0 km s −1 . Despite local deviations, a trend can be observed for velocities to decrease from large ℓ toward Sgr A*. This trend may be extended to the other directions. The 20 km s −1 cloud, for example, is closer to Sgr A* than the 50 km s −1 cloud which itself is closer to the Center of the Galaxy than Sgr B2 at 70 km s −1 . The velocity decline toward Sgr A* may indicate streaming motions along the central bar of the Galaxy (e.g., Blitz & Spergel 1991), or an x 2 orbit along the a 100 pc dust ring described by Molinari et al. (2011) (see also Sect. 4.3). In the first case, if we take the angle of the Galactic bar with respect to the Sun-Sgr A* line of 22 • (Babusiaux & Gilmore 2005), we derive a velocity gradient of the molecular gas at the de-projected distance of Sgr B2 (∼ 270 pc) of ∼ 75 km s −1 along the bar toward Sgr A* (projected, i.e., measured distance and velocity: ∼ 100 pc and ∼ 70 km s −1 ). This corresponds to an average velocity gradient of ∼ 0.28 km s −1 pc −1 . The dynamic timescale for Sgr B2 gas streaming along the bar toward the Galactic Center would be therefore ∼ 3.5 Myr in this picture. If Sgr B2 is on the 100 pc ring (see Sect. 4.3), it will take ∼ 2 Myr to reach a position that is aligned in projection with Sgr A*.

The linewidths of the ammonia emission are in the range of 20-40 km s −1 without significant differences toward individual regions (see Table 1). In Fig. 2 we show the 2 nd moment of the ammonia (1,1) data cube. The very large values in this map, however, are at positions with multiple line components and do not reflect the true velocity dispersions of the ammonia distribution.


### Temperature Map

One of the main goals of this survey is to derive a temperature map of the region between Sgr A* and Sgr B2. As alluded to in the introduction, the ratio of the upper level populations N u for two different inversion lines, (J ′ ,J ′ ) and (J,J), can be expressed by a rotational temperature T rot . This parameter can be derived via the following equation
N u (J ′ , J ′ ) N u (J, J) = g op (J ′ ) g op (J) 2J ′ + 1 2J + 1 exp −∆E T rot,JJ ′ ,(2)
(e.g., Ott et al. 2005). ∆E is the energy difference between the NH 3 (J ′ , J ′ ) and the NH 3 (J, J) levels in K [41.2 K between NH 3 (1,1) and (2,2)], g op are the statistical weights given as g op = 1 for both para-ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions. Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) radiative transfer models (e.g. Ott et al. 2005) show that the population distribution (and thus the temperature) is almost entirely independent of the density of the gas, and the above relation can be used for densities that start at the critical density of ammonia of ∼ 10 3 cm −3 up to extreme densities of ∼ 10 7 cm −3 .

For low temperatures, the rotational temperatures correspond well to kinetic temperatures. At higher energies, however, collisional de-excitation and the dependency of the collisional cross-section on the energy result in a deviation from this trend. LVG calculations suggest that the equation
T kin = 6.06 × exp(0.061 T rot,12 )(3)
provides a reasonable approximation for the conversion from T rot,12 to T kin (see figure 5 in Ott et al. 2011). The relation is flattening at T kin 80 K (T rot,12 ∼ 40 K) and we therefore consider 80 K as the lower limit for all higher temperatures (similar calculations are shown, e.g. in Guesten et al. 1981;Walmsley & Ungerechts 1983;Mauersberger et al. 1986;Danby et al. 1988). To determine higher temperatures more accurately, higher J = K inversion lines need to be observed (e.g. Mills & Morris 2013).

Applying Eq. 3 to our data, we construct a kinetic temperature map of the region between Sgr A* and Sgr B2 which is displayed in Fig. 8. Most of the kinetic gas temperatures, in particular in the molecular arcs between Sgr A* and Sgr B2 are relatively uniform at ∼ 30 K for smaller clouds and about ∼ 50 K for the larger molecular complexes. Hotter molecular gas with temperatures of 80 K are found towards clouds in the vicinity of Sgr A* and in the Sgr B2 region. In particular, across Sgr B2 a temperature gradient is visible with temperatures exceeding 80 K at high Galactic latitude and longitude, and much colder temperatures of ∼ 30 K at lower Galactic latitudes and longitudes. First indications for this gradient have been described in the literature e.g. in Churchwell & Hollis (1983) or Huttemeister et al. (1993), but the gradient was never imaged in this lucidity before.

3.6. Optical Depths As already mentioned, the lines in the observed field are, with ∼ 20 − 40 km s −1 , quite broad. On the other side, our velocity resolution of ∼ 6.3 km s −1 is relatively coarse. Together, both properties of the data make it difficult to determine the strength of the ammonia hyperfine lines that are ∼ ±8 km s −1 and ∼ ±20 km s −1 from the main line. However, for some relatively narrow lines it is possible to detect the hyperfine lines separately and in Fig. 3 lines at positions 2, 6, 11, 19, 24, 25, and 28, do show some indications of the ∼ ±20 km s −1 hyperfine structure. For those lines the main-to-hyperfine line flux ratios are very consistent at a ratio of ∼ 2.2 with only ∼ 20% variation. Using: (Ho & Townes 1983) we derive optical depths τ to be ∼ 2.4 ± 1.
T mb,peak (main lines) T mb,peak (outer hyperfine lines) = 1 − exp(−τ ) 1 − exp(−0.22 τ )(4)
A spectral fit with the NH 3 fitting routines in the CLASS software provide similar optical depths, ranging from about τ ∼ 1 to ∼ 3.5, with the majority in the τ ∼ 1.5 to 2 range. The fits, taking into account the hyperfine line strengths, also result in line widths that are smaller than the measured ones and typically 10-20 km s −1 less than the simple FWHM linewidths.

The calculations of the column densities (Sec. 3.3) assume optically thin ammonia lines. A correction for the sightlines with moderate optical depths can be expressed by τ /(1−exp[−τ ]). For our τ ∼ 1−2.4 cases this amounts to ∼ 1.6 − 2.7. Changes to the temperature, however, are minimal and the correction factors cancel out (Eq. 2) when the optical depths for the (1,1) and (2,2) lines are identical. This is in fact a good assumption since the average temperatures of the gas is at ∼ 38 K (see Sect. 4.4, see also Sect. 3.5), which is in between the energies above ground for the (1,1) [E = 22.7 K] and (2,2) [E = 63.9 K] levels, respectively. In the unlikely edge cases where one of the transitions is optically thin and the other exhibits τ ∼ 2, any temperature corrections would also be close to a factor of ∼ 2, with colder temperatures for higher optical depths of the (1,1) line.


## DISCUSSION


### Comparison to SCUBA observations

In Fig. 9 we show ammonia (1,1) column density contours overlaid on a SCUBA 850 µm map. The absolute flux of the SCUBA data is somewhat uncertain due to the chopping technique used (see Pierce-Price et al. 2000, for a description of the original data) and should be treated as a lower limit since extended flux is likely filtered out. As mentioned in Sect. 2.2, our interferometric ammonia measurements suffer from similar problems and a short spacing correction with single dish data would be required to recover the entire flux of the region. Therefore, on large scales, the comparison of extended emission in both maps will not be very reliable. On more compact scales, on which this paper focuses, however, the data can be compared and the ammonia (1,1) column densities and the SCUBA 850 µm data trace each other extremely well. All features, except for Sgr A* and the ammonia absorption against the compact H ii regions Sgr B2(N) and (M) are reproduced in both datasets. Sgr A* is dominated by non-thermal emission (e.g., Liu & Melia 2001) and is therefore unrelated to dusty molecular gas.

To determine the validity of a dust-to-gas relationship between ammonia and the SCUBA 850 µm data, we determined both fluxes in each pixel (4 ′′ in size) after smoothing to a common resolution of 30 ′′ . Following this, we binned the distribution of the pixels in the NH 3 (1,1) column density versus the SCUBA 850 µm fluxes in order to obtain a point density distribution of these values. The logarithmically scaled point density distribution is shown in Fig. 10. The tip of the contours (largest values in dust and gas) follow an almost linear relation as indicated by the dashed line. The line, however, is not centered on the origin of the plot but shifted along the SCUBA 850 µm axis. This offset may be the result of the missing large scale flux of both maps. However, if the 850 µm flux is underestimated, the line would shift even further away from the origin on this axis. On the other hand, if it is mainly the interferometric ammonia measurements where we miss flux, the graph would shift up and could be brought in agreement with starting at the origin. But such a shift would be extreme as a correction of ∼ 2×10 15 cm −2 is required, a value that would almost double the column density for an average cloud (taking account missing SCUBA flux will increase the difference even further). Temperature variations of gas and dust are unlikely to have a significant effect on the slope of the plot, but could broaden the distribution. We also corrected for the temperature and calculated total ammonia column densities from the (1,1) line and the temperature (via the Eq. A15 in Ungerechts et al. 1986). As listed in Table 2, the (1,1) and (2,2) populations are together about half of the total ammonia column density that we derive from our data. A comparison with the entire ammonia column density thus leads to a very similar plot as the one shown in Fig. 10 and it does not contain a substantial additive component. In addition, 850 µm dust fluxes are not exceedingly susceptible to variations in temperature. The offset of the line may thus be due to a large amount of missing flux from extended emission mainly of the NH 3 (1,1) line. A different explanation for the offset would be that the ammonia forms on dust grains which also shields the material and that a minimum of dust is required to produce ammonia efficiently and to protect it against destruction through the surrounding UV radiation field (see also the discussion in Weiß et al. 2001).


### The Radio Filaments and the Molecular Gas

In contrast to the SCUBA maps, the radio continuum emission and the molecular gas as traced by ammonia show little coincidence. Only the star forming region Sgr B2 exhibits radio continuum emission from the H ii regions at the same positions where large amounts of molecular gas are found (see Fig. 2). For this region it is obvious that the molecular gas most likely feeds the current star forming activity. As already noted by Mehringer et al. (1995), there is much less molecular gas in the star forming Sgr B1 region at (ℓ, b) = (0.50 • , −0.05 • ). This may indicate that the Sgr B1 region is more evolved than Sgr B2 and that the remaining molecular gas has already been dispersed.

In addition, the non-thermal radio arcs at ℓ ∼ 0.15 also occupy a region with only little ammonia line emission. The pistol/sickle region at (0.16 • , −0.06 • ), for example, exhibits NH 3 (1,1) column densities of only ∼ 2 × 10 13 cm −2 . In addition, at larger Galactic latitudes, the radio arc bifurcates into two roughly parallel components at ℓ ∼ 0.19 • and ℓ ∼ 0.17 • . Along the filaments, the NH 3 (1,1) column densities are ∼ 12×10 14 cm −2 , whereas the column density in the very thin, long area in between the two filaments rises up to ∼ 28×10 13 cm −2 . The radio emission in the two arched thermal filaments that connect to the main non-thermal arcs and that stretch from (0.14 • , 0.05 • ) to (0.08 • , 0.00 • ) and from (0.10 • , 0.08 • ) to (0.06 • , 0.02 • ) are also in regions with low NH 3 average column densities. Toward lower Galactic latitude and lower Galactic longitudes, however, very prominent molecular gas clumps are apparent in the integrated intensity maps (c.f. Fig. 2). A notable exception to this behavior is the "handle" of the pistol/sickle, the radio filament that extends roughly perpendicular to the large non-thermal radio arcs at Galactic latitudes of ∼ −0.04 • . Molecular gas appears to be aligned with this feature and exhibits column densities of ∼ 2.4 × 10 14 cm −2 . Finally, the region around Sgr A* with the associated mini-spiral is also very bright in 1.2 cm radio continuum emission but has only weak features of molecular gas. In particular, the very prominent circumnuclear, molecular ring around Sgr A*, which is very bright in HCN (Christopher et al. 2005), is not exceptionally strong in the NH 3 (1,1) and (2,2) transitions (see Sect. 4.6). The ammonia feature has a somewhat larger diameter than that of HCN and column densities of 2 − 4 × 10 14 cm −2 . This is up to an order of magnitude less than the column densities in the 20 and 50 km s −1 clouds. The more isolated radio continuum regions at (−0.013 • , 0.021 • ) and (−0.053 • , 0.020 • ) also show local peaks in the ammonia distribution of a few 10 14 cm −2 . Associated star formation may thus be in a relatively early stage.

4.3. The Molecular Arcs and the 100 pc Dust Ring Some of the most prominent features in the interferometric ammonia map (Fig. 2) are the two molecular arcs west of Sgr B2, between ℓ ≈ 0.2 • and 0.6 • . The two Galactic northern and southern arcs are almost symmetric in shape, mirrored along a line at constant b ≈ −0.02 • . The northern arc is certainly much brighter than the low-b counterpart. In Fig. 9(c) we show an overlay of the ammonia to Spitzer 8 µm data. Some of the detected gas corresponds very well to strong absorption features in the infrared images. In particular the northern arc is heavily absorbing the infrared emission whereas the southern arc is hardly visible in the Spitzer image at all. Similarly, the string of molecular clouds north of Sgr A* are less absorbing than those south of Sgr A*, namely the 20 and 50 km s −1 clouds. This can be interpreted such that the northern arc and the clouds south of Sgr A* are in front of most of the IR emission whereas the southern arc and the clouds north of Sgr A* are located behind. The different structures are indicated by the sinusoidal solid (back structure) and dashed (front) lines in Fig. 4(b) (also in Fig. 7). This picture is consistent with the morphology of the "figure 8" 100 pc ring that was recently detected in a Herschel temperature map by Molinari et al. (2011). The shapes of the dust ring and our ammonia arcs are very similar and the ammonia may thus be emitted by clumps residing in the dust ring. Molinari et al. (2011) claim that the ring is rotating, based on single dish data of the CS molecule. Our data is filtering out the diffuse emission and the clumps seem to follow a somewhat different picture. Whereas the Molinari et al. (2011) interpretation suggests that the foreground arc east of Sgr A* should be redshifted compared to the background arc, we find the opposite. In Fig. 7 the northern, foreground arc (dashed line), is at lower velocities compared the foreground arc (solid line). The velocities of the two arcs are less distinct toward Sgr B2 and at the position of the non-thermal arcs at about b ∼ 0.15 • . This indicates that the structure might be described by an expansion with a velocity of ∼ 30 km s −1 . Signatures for an expansion were also detected in previous CO measurements by (Sofue 1995), albeit at much larger expansion velocities. A comparison of our ammonia data with the intensity-weighted N 2 H + map presented in Jones et al. (2012) corroborates the view gained on the basis of the ammonia data alone, i.e. it appears to contradict the rotating ring picture. Our map, unfortunately, does not cover the region between Sgr A* and Sgr C, which contains the other half of the 100 pc ring at ℓ < 0 • .


### The Temperature Distribution of Molecular Clumps

Due to the filtering effect of the ATCA interferometer, we derive the temperature distribution of molecular clumps more or less directly, with little contribution from diffuse inter-clump gas. In Fig. 11(a), we show the kinetic temperature distribution of all pixels in our map. The distribution peaks at about 38 K and has a FWHM of 43 K, spanning the 18-61 K range. We derive very few areas with a lower limit of kinetic temperatures of > 80 K. Previous studies have detected high temperature components in the Galactic Center molecular gas using single dish telescopes (e.g. Guesten et al. 1981;Huettemeister et al. 1993b;Rodríguez-Fernández et al. 2001;Ao et al. 2013;Mills & Morris 2013). It is very likely that the hot material is mostly diffuse and filtered out by our interferometric observations in combination with that our (1,1) and (2,2) lines are not sensitive to high temperatures. This pronounces the clumpier material which is substantially colder on average. From Fig. 8(b) we may see a trend that smaller clumps exhibit colder temperatures. A different view is shown in Fig. 11 where we plot the logarithm of the total ammonia column density (cf. Sect. 4.1) to the derived kinetic temperature of the gas. The pixel by pixel correlation has been binned and logarithmic contours are shown. The plot confirms that gas at higher column density also tends to show a higher temperature. If the heating is external, one would expect it to affect clouds of all sizes to similar depths. Smaller clumps would thus be more thoroughly heated whereas larger clumps would be able to maintain a colder inner core. Since we see the opposite, we may assume that most of the gas heating takes place internal to the individual clumps. If the star formation rate per molecular gas mass is roughly constant, larger clumps will contain more proto-stars, in particular more massive proto-stars. Those stars are the most likely candidates for internal heating. We hardly detect massive clumps with very low temperatures, or small clumps with large temperatures. Small clumps that do contain massive proto-stars may in fact dissipate relatively quickly, eluding their observation.

The Galactic Center, however, is known to contain external heating sources such as cosmic rays, shocks, a strong UV field, X-ray sources, and dust. As explained above, most of the heating in the clumps is likely internal. But in some places the external heating may play a significant role, even for the smaller clumps. Notably, this includes the bow-shaped region from the thermal, arched filaments, through the high column density 50 km s −1 and 20 km s −1 clouds, in addition to the compact and dense Sgr B 2 region which exhibits a strong temperature gradient (both traced by the yellow and red spots in Fig. 8[a]). The bow-shaped region is close to Sgr A*. Although the CND is cooler (see Sect. 4.6), the warmer gas may be influenced by activity of Sgr A*, which may cause larger X-ray and cosmic ray fluxes, as well as shocks. PDR effects may play a major role in the "mini-starburst" Sgr B2, which is also a place where the x 1 and x 2 orbits of the central stellar bar intersect. The resulting shocks might be an additional heating mechanism for the molecular gas in that area and can potentially explain the Sgr B2 temperature gradient that is hotter at larger Galactic longitude values.


### The Arches and Quintuplet Cluster Regions

Besides the Sgr B regions, young stellar clusters are visible all across the CMZ. Two of the most prominent, massive clusters are the Arches (0.121 • , 0.017 • ) and the Quintuplet (0.160 • , −0.059 • ) clusters displayed in Fig. 12. The clusters have masses of ∼ 10 4 M ⊙ and are with ages of ∼ 2 Myr for the Arches and ∼ 4 Myr for the Quintuple cluster (Figer et al. 1999) relatively young. The different ages may also be reflected in the dense gas map. Close to the Arches cluster, a large filament of dense molecular gas extends roughly parallel to the non-thermal radio continuum filament. The immediate surroundings of the Quintuplet cluster, however, are relatively clear of ammonia and may have dispersed over the lifetime of this cluster. The three-color composite map of the region in Fig. 12 shows how different the distributions of the gas tracers are. CO emission ) is brightest closer in the direction to the Galactic Center and only little is visible in a roughly circular region that is defined by the radio arcs, the pistol/sickle and the thermal arched radio filaments that extend from the non-thermal arc to smaller Galactic longitudes. This region can be roughly described by a circle centered on (ℓ, b) = (0.138 • , −0.007 • ) and having a diameter of 0.08 • (indicated by the cyan circle in Fig. 4[b]). The region, almost entirely surrounded by radio continuum emission appears to be filled with [C I] 3 P 0 − 3 P 1 emitting gas (rest frequency: 492.161 GHz; data from Martin et al. 2004).

[C I] is a well-known tracer for photo-dissociation regions (PDR) and this indicates that the gas is mainly ionized within this cavity. This is supported by the detection of Fe Kα 6.4 keV emission in the region (Wang et al. 2002(Wang et al. , 2006Tatischeff et al. 2012). The gas traced by ammonia is scattered all across that area. The main filaments, however, are close to the radio continuum emission toward the inside of the region. The two stellar clusters are also at the inner edge of the radio continuum emission. The ammonia channel maps (Fig. 5) at this position show signatures that may be interpreted as an expanding structure but the relative velocities could well be due to other motions, too. If it is expanding, the driving force could be provided by the gas traced by [C I]. This scenario would also explain why the morphology and kinematics of the NH 3 emission does not follow the overall sinusoidal pattern that is prominently observed by the molecular arcs between the shell (cyan circle in Fig. 4[b]) and Sgr B2, which is continued south and north of Sgr A* (Sect. 4.3).

The presence of strong [C I] emission also indicates PDR conditions and hence a higher ionizing flux and, since the [C I] emission is widespread, a higher temperature. The temperature map of ammonia (Fig. 8), however, shows values of T kin ∼ 40 − 60 K which are only slightly enhanced compared to other, more quiet regions of the mapped area. The denser gas therefore appears to be well-shielded against heating from ionizing flux. If the picture of an expanding shell structure holds true, the distribution of the different gas tracers may thus indicate that dense gas forms a boundary layer that is filled with ionized and PDR gas (see also the discussion in Sect. 4.2). The dense gas layer is also where the Arches and Quintuplet clusters are located. The radio continuum is emitted in an additional sheet surrounding the dense gas that takes the role of the interface to the unaffected ISM. Substructures are observed close to the stellar clusters and within the radio continuum emission.

The more immediate environment of the Quintuplet cluster is relatively devoid of ammonia emission but has a local peak in [C I]. It also shows radio continuum emission aligned with the outer part of the structure. This emission forms the pistol/sickle region. The situation is less clear for the gas in the immediate surroundings of the Arches cluster. The Arches appears to be located on the rim of a cavity, that is centered on (ℓ, b) ∼ (0.107 • , 0.033 • ) and filled with PDR gas. Since warm, ionized gas follows the path of least resistance, it may originate from the Arches cluster but then accumulate in this substructure.


### The Circumnuclear Disk

The circumnuclear disk around Sgr A* is the most central position in our Milky Way at which substantial amounts of molecular gas are detected. The ring has been mapped in various dense molecular tracers, like HCN (e.g. Christopher et al. 2005;Montero-Castaño et al. 2009;Martín et al. 2012) and shows a characteristic diameter of an arcminute (or about 3 pc) with a total mass of ∼ 10 6 M ⊙ stored in various clumps (Christopher et al. 2005). A temperature map with NH 3 (1,1) column density contours is shown in Fig. 13. We detect a clumpy structure that is in broad agreement with the HCN observations. Herrnstein & Ho (2005) mapped the region in the ammonia lines with the Very Large Array. They detect an even clumpier distribution with their more extended array. With our shorter spacings, we are able to detect the most likely connection of the CND with the 20 km s −1 cloud and possibly the 50 km s −1 cloud (see also McGary et al. 2001). The 20 km s −1 cloud has a velocity gradient and at the position where it connects to the CND, the value is about 40 km s −1 (see Fig. 13). From this level, the values roughly decrease in a clockwise direction around the CND. This indicates that gas is fed from the 20 km s −1 to the CND.

Given that the CND is only ∼ 1.5 pc away from the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, it is surprisingly cold. We detect kinetic temperatures between 25 K in the clumps and a maximum of ∼ 70 K in some inter-clump regions. Our values are much lower than single dish measurements that derive a few hundred K for two regions of the CND (e.g. Requena-Torres et al. 2012). This could indicate that the CND is composed of clumpy cold and diffuse hot material as we are not sensitive to extended emission. The temperature structure of the clumps in the CND is not significantly different from regions further away, e.g. in the molecular arcs (Sect. 4.3). As seen in Fig. 8, the temperatures of the CND are also lower than those in a the warmer bow-shaped region described in Sect. 4.4. Cooling and shielding appears to be more efficient in the CND, if the higher surrounding temperatures are caused by Sgr A*.


## SUMMARY

We observed the region between the supermassive black hole Sgr A* and the massive star forming region Sgr B2 in our Milky Way with the ATCA in the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines (−0.2 • l 0.8 • ;

−0.13 • b 0.07 • ). The interferometric data filters the clumpy structure that otherwise blends with a more diffuse component in single dish observations. We find the following:

• The dense gas is distributed in many filamentary structures with two prominent molecular arcs between Sgr A* and Sgr B2. The dense molecular arcs are likely located on the '100 pc' ring that was recently detected in Herschel dust temperature maps.

• Except for the extreme Sgr B2 region, the 1.2 cm radio continuum and ammonia emission are almost anti-coincident. This includes the continuum emitted from Sgr B1, the non-thermal arcs, the arched, thermal filaments, as well as the mini-spiral around Sgr A*.

• SCUBA 850µm data trace the dense ammonia gas very well, in an almost linear relationship. We see possible indications that a minimum amount of dust may be required for substantial amounts of ammonia to form and survive the encompassing UV radiation field.

• A map of kinetic temperatures is constructed that is reasonably accurate in the 10-80 K range. For some of the gas, in particular gas close to Sgr B2 and in the vicinity of the 20 and 50 km s −1 clouds and the arched, thermal filaments, we derive a lower limit of > 80 K for the kinetic temperature.

• The peak of the kinetic temperature distribution is at ∼ 38 K with a FWHM that spans 18-61 K. On average, larger clumps exhibit larger temperatures than smaller clumps. The dominating heating mechanism is thus likely internal, and possible sources could be proto-stars.

• The molecular gas for the circumnuclear disk immediately surrounding Sgr A* with a radius of ∼ 1.5 pc is likely being supplied by the 20 km s −1 cloud. The CND is cooler than gas in the 20 km s −1 and 50 km s −1 clouds, and gas closer to the arched, thermal filaments.

• The region close to the Arches and Quintuplet clusters shows signs for a layered structure with more diffuse PDR gas that is surrounded by dense ammonia clumps. Furthermore, the radio continuum filaments form an outer layer.

The Galactic Center is an energetic region and understanding the dense gas clumps is key to understanding star formation in extreme conditions. The difference of the diffuse and dense gas components can be revealed by additional single dish observations. Finally it will be desirable to observe higher transitions over the full CMZ to obtain a map of a larger range of temperatures. For example, the NH 3 (2,2) line has an energy of ∼ 64 K above ground, but the (3,3), (6,6) and (9,9) levels are at ∼ 123 K, ∼ 407 K, and ∼ 852 K, respectively, and therefore trace much warmer gas. Other temperature tracers can be used to calibrate all methods against each other. The CMZ is also an important benchmark for comparisons with other galactic nuclei, near and far, active and quiet. Understanding the details of heating and cooling, star formation, AGN feedback and gas transfer in the nearby CMZ is therefore indispensable to understand the role of nuclear regions for galaxy evolution at all cosmic epochs.

## TABLE 2## OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION


### General Setup

We observed the Galactic Center during 8 nights on 2005 August 3-8, 10, and 12 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA 1 , project id: C 1322) with 5 antennas in the most compact, hybrid H 75 array configuration (baselines in the range of 31 to 89 m). Antenna CA 06 was also used but, due to the long baselines to the rest of the array (∼ 4.5 km), it is down-weighted and does not contribute substantially to the surface brightness sensitivity.

The K-band system at the ATCA was tuned to observe both polarizations at a center frequency of 23.708 GHz with a bandwidth of 64 MHz split into 128 channels. This setup was chosen to observe both, the NH 3 (1,1) (rest frequency: 23.6945GHz) and (2,2) (rest frequency: 23.7226 GHz) lines simultaneously within the same band (when adjusting for the systemic velocity of the Galactic Center and the observatory velocity at the time of the observations). This resulted in a velocity resolution of ∼ 6.3 km s −1 at a total Local Standard of Rest (LSR) velocity range of -180 to +165 km s −1 common to both lines.

Given that the shortest baseline is 31 m, the array is only sensitive to emission less than ∼ 1.3 ′ , which corresponds to about half the primary beam of the observations (∼ 2.4 ′ ).


### Mosaicking Technique

Our survey covers an area of 0.2 degree 2 , 1 • in Galactic longitude (−0.2 • ℓ 0.8 • ) and 0.2 • in Galactic latitude (−0.13 • b 0.07 • ), i.e., it is centered on ℓ = 0.3 • and b = 0.03 • . At the assumed distance of the Galactic Center, 8.5 kpc, the covered area corresponds to widths of ∼ 148 pc in ℓ and ∼ 30 pc in b, ∼ 4440 pc 2 in total.

A hexagonal, fully-sampled pointing pattern was used to cover the observed area (primary K-band beam of the ATCA: ∼ 2. ′ 4), 840 pointings in total. To obtain the most uniform uv-coverage we set up the following mosaicking strategy: The field was split up into 6 different, 1 The Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia Telescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO. equal sized sub-regions along Galactic longitude, with 140 pointing centers each. In addition, each sub-region was furthermore split up into two different scans, each of which covers half (i.e. 70 pointings) of the area: an ℓ scan along Galactic longitude and a b scan along Galactic latitude (see Fig. 1). Scans of the fields were started at different sidereal times during the 8 nights making sure that each scan and field, i.e. the entire 840 pointings of the survey, are covered at least once per night and in rare occasions twice. The typical uv-coverage of a single pointing is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. Note, however, that due to our distinct ℓ and b scan driving scheme and the overlaps of the primary beams in the hexagonal pattern, the actual uv-coverage at any position on the map is better.

Each pointing has an integration time of ∼ 30 s per night, accumulating to ∼ 4 min in total. Time lost between the pointings due to acceleration and deceleration of the ATCA dishes for our survey amounts to about a second and is therefore negligible.


### Calibration

Flux calibration was performed using daily observations of the ATCA standard calibrator PKS 1934-638. The ∼ 1.3 Jy bright phase (complex gain) calibrator PKS 1710-269 was observed twice for 2 min each ℓ or b scan, i.e. every ∼ 35 min (see Sect. 2.2). PKS 1710-269 is located at the Galactic coordinates ℓ = 357.73044774 • , b = 6.99364372 • and can be considered to be a point source for this array configuration and frequency. The same source was used to update the pointing of the individual ATCA antennas every ∼ 1.5 hours with typical corrections of ∼ 5 ′′ . Antenna-based bandpasses were determined by daily ∼ 10 min integrations on PKS 1255-053 (also known as 3C279), which has a flux of ∼ 15 Jy in K-band. We estimate the absolute flux uncertainty to ∼ 15 %. Note, however, that both ammonia lines were observed in the same band. Relative flux values and resulting parameters such as the temperature (Sect. 4.4) are therefore much more accurate.

All data reduction steps were performed with the MIRIAD software package (Sault et al. 1995). All data were first corrected for atmospheric opacity (task atlod with option opcorr) and edited for corrupt visibilities and shadowed antennas. Furthermore, the first seven and last 3 edge channels were discarded. The task mfcal was used to obtain bandpass and complex gain solutions and gpboot performed absolute flux calibration. This solution was bootstrapped to the complex gain calibrator (and eventually to the data) when the latter was at the same elevation as the flux calibrator PKS 1934-638. The 1.2 cm radio continuum was separated from the uv data using line-free channels at either end of the spectra and in between the NH 3 (1,1) and (2,2) lines (task uvlin).


### Imaging

The task invert was used to Fourier transform the visibilities into a combined mosaic image of all pointings, including the corrections for the primary beam shapes. During that step the visibilities were weighted in the natural scheme as well as by the inverse of their noise variance. Eventually the data were deconvolved with the maximum entropy algorithm as implemented in mosmem. A first step comprised a non-restricted 30 iteration run of mosmem across the mosaic, followed by a restoration of the cube (task restor). This cube, however, still showed considerable sidelobe structure. The results improved substantially after using the result from the first application of mosmem, convolving it to about twice the natural beam size, and blanking all values below 100 mJy beam −1 per channel, in the following we call this cube the 'mask'. Eventually, the original data set was deconvolved again, but we forced mosmem to only act on those pixels where the mask was non-blank. The restoration process of the resulting new deconvolved model with the residuals of the deconvolution process did eventually preserve the fluxes in the maps. The effects of the sidelobes on the data, however, were drastically reduced. We checked the fluxes of the maximum entropy deconvolution with the more familiar CLEAN algorithm (task mossdi) and found that while the fluxes are comparable, the extended emission was much better reproduced with mosmem.

The final data have a beam size of ∼ 26. ′′ 2 × 16. ′′ 8, with a position angle of −70 • , corresponding to a physical resolution in the Galactic Center of ∼ 1.1 pc ×0.7 pc. The pixel size of the data was chosen to be 4 ′′ . The flux rms noise per channel is ∼ 7 mJy beam −1 which corresponds to an rms brightness of ∼ 35 mK.

Eventually, the total data cube was split into cubes that comprise only the NH 3 (1,1) or the NH 3 (2,2) inversion lines.


## RESULTS


### Radio Continuum

Using the line-free channels from our data, we are also able to construct a 1.2 cm continuum map which is displayed in Fig. 2(b). The dynamic range across all pointings of the mosaic is of order 10 4 with the brightest sources toward Sgr A* at T mb = 30.5 K (with some confusion from close-by sources), and Sgr B2 (M) and (N) with main beam brightness temperatures of 48.5 K and 27.9 K, respectively. The 'mini-spiral' associated with Sgr A* is also visible as is the Sgr B1 region at (ℓ, b) ≈ (0.49 • , −0.06 • ). Some of the most striking features are the presence of the non-thermal radio arcs along Galactic longitudes of ℓ ∼ 0.18 • . Their fluxes increase from high to low latitudes from ∼ 0.2 to ∼ 0.6 K with the brightest, ∼ 1.4 K spots in the 'pistol' or 'sickle' region at (ℓ, b) = (0.189 • , −0.051 • ) (see Fig. 2; for a spectral index analysis, see Lang et al. 1999). The thin, unresolved vertical filaments appear to be connected in projection to the thermal, arched filaments that start at b ≈ 0.07 and extend to (ℓ, b) ≈ (0.071 • , −0.001 • ). Between that position and the Sgr A* region, a number of scattered radio continuum point sources are detected in the map. Overall, the 1.2 cm ATCA radio continuum map exhibits a very similar morphology when compared to the 21 cm and 90 cm Very Large Array maps presented by Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2004), Anantharamaiah et al. (1991), and Nord et al. (2004). The low frequency maps, however, also contain a number of finer, arcminute long filaments, perpendicular to the plane, sometimes called non-thermal radio filaments (NRFs) or threads, that we do not detect in our 1.2 cm data.


### Sample Spectra

In Fig 3 we show spectra from the ammonia datacubes at different positions in the CMZ. The measured parameters of Gaussian fits to the spectra are listed in Table 1 and derived values in Table 2. For better orientation, we also indicate the area that the positions belong to in Table 2. Ammonia (1,1) peak brightness temperatures are typically around ∼ 1 K with values of up to ∼ 17 K. NH 3 (2,2) peak temperatures are typically ∼ 10% weaker than those of the (1,1) line. FWHM widths of the sample spectra are 20-40 km s −1 . Some of the positions show multiple ammonia components and are listed with "a" and "b" appendices in the tables. Ammonia has hyperfine structure which needs to be distinguished from multiple gas components and also adds to the FWHM. An analysis is presented in Sect. 3.6.

Absorption is observed toward the star forming regions Sgr B2 (N) at position 32, Sgr B2 (M) at position 29, and the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at position 7. The absorption spectra are rather complex and contain all components along the lines of sight from the earth to the CMZ.


### Total Intensity

The integrated ammonia (1,1) intensity map is shown in Fig. 2. In this representation, the velocity integrated brightness temperature was converted NH 3 (1,1) column densities. The upper level columns of the inversion line can be derived via the following relation: (Henkel et al. 2000) where N u is given in units of cm −2 , the frequency ν in GHz, the main beam brightness temperature T mb in K, and the velocity v in km s −1 . The upper and lower levels of each inversion line are almost evenly populated due to the small energy difference. We therefore double each upper level population to arrive at the total, upper and lower population for each line. The dynamic range of the map spans more than 2 orders of magnitude with the Sgr B2 molecular cloud being exceptionally bright. In fact, the interferometric map around Sgr B2 shows a very steep gradient with a decline in brightness by a factor of ∼ 30 within a radius of only 5 pc (for a more detailed discussion of the profile see Protheroe et al. 2008). Part of the steep decline, however, might be due to the missing short spacings which filters out very extended emission (Sect. 2). Single dish maps (e.g. Guesten et al. 1981;Handa et al. 2006;Purcell et al. 2012) show extremely bright and extended emission, so the short spacing filtering effect is substantial in this region and we detect only the local peaks of the emission. Toward the positions of Sgr B2 (M) and (N) at (0.667 • , −0.036 • ) and (0.680 • , −0.029 • ), respectively, the ultra-compact H ii regions (see also Fig. 2[b]) are bright enough in the radio continuum to yield ammonia absorption instead of emission. This explains the two 'holes' on top of this region.
N u (J, K) = 7.77 × 10 13 ν J(J + 1) K 2 T mb dv (1)
Very striking features are the two 'molecular arcs' in between Sgr B2 and a Galactic longitude of ∼ 0.2 • . The molecular arcs appear to be symmetric with the symmetry axis slightly below the zero Galactic latitude line at b ∼ −0.02 • ; one arc spanning up to b ∼ 0.06 • and the other up to b ∼ −0.09 • (outlined by a dashed and dotted line in Fig. 4). If they are coherent features, they have lengths of ∼ 0.5 • which corresponds to ∼ 75 pc. They are mostly coincident with the dusty ring detected as a cold structure in Herschel temperature maps by Molinari et al. (2011) (see also Sect. 4.3). One of the brightest clumps being part of the molecular arcs is the 'brick' G0.253+0.016 at ∼ (0.253 • , 0.016 • ). It is a high density, compact molecular clump with an integrated brightness temperature of ∼ 230 K km s −1 that could be the formation site of a massive star cluster (e.g. Longmore et al. 2012).

The sightline toward Sgr A* is relatively weak with a temperature-velocity integral of ∼ 11.7 K km s −1 . At distances of ∼ 30 ′′ from Sgr A* however, we do see surrounding emission from the circumnuclear disk (CND), a feature that is also prominent in lines of other molecules such as HCN (Christopher et al. 2005;Montero-Castaño et al. 2009, see Sect. 4.6 for details).

Toward negative Galactic longitudes, the 20 km s −1 cloud at (ℓ, b) ∼ (−0.1, −0.08) is one of the strongest features in our map and it splits into three almost parallel filaments with lengths of ∼ 0.1 • or ∼ 15 pc. The two at higher b are with 110-130 K km s −1 very similar in integrated brightness, whereas the one at lower b is somewhat weaker with 80-100 K km s −1 .

In between the 20 km s −1 cloud and the molecular arcs is the region where the massive Arches and Quintuplet clusters reside (see Sect. 4.5). In that part of the CMZ, the molecular arcs intersect in projection, giving way to a somewhat rounder, shell-like structure. This structure is located near to a large cloud that is elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane in the vicinity of the nonthermal radio continuum arc (Sect. 3.1). From there, two molecular features are visible that form a ">" shape and merge close to the 20 km s −1 cloud.


### Global Velocity Structure

Binning three channels to velocity widths of ∼ 19 km s −1 , the channel maps of the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) inversion line emission are displayed in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. As expected, the NH 3 (2,2) emission is generally somewhat fainter but very similar in structure to the (1,1) emission. Given the dynamic range of the data (see Sect. 3.3), we display the maps in logarithmic units. At low velocities, the tip of the 20 km s −1 cloud as well as the molecular arc at b > 0 • are visible (see also Fig. 2). The southern molecular arc breaks up into clouds at velocities ∼ 20 km s −1 and ∼ 80 km s −1 and is therefore not as coherent in velocity space as the northern one. It is somewhat surprising that this arc does not have many cloud components in the intermediate velocity range at ∼ 50 km s −1 . The molecular gas at (ℓ < 0 • , b > 0 • ) is in the velocity range of 50 − 100 km s −1 with an additional component at ∼ −60 to −40 km s −1 . The intensityweighted velocity map (moment 1; Fig. 4) indicates a very similar velocity structure in the (ℓ < 0 • , b > 0 • ) region and the arc structure at negative b values between Sgr A* and Sgr B2. Note that emission at negative velocities is relatively weak and thus the intensity-weighted velocity map displayed in Fig. 4(b) is biased toward larger values.

In Fig. 7 we show a position-velocity map of the entire data cube. The greyscale is the peak intensity determined along b. In this plot the velocity difference between the different molecular arcs becomes apparent again, with a maximum separation of ∼ 100 km s −1 and an indication that the tips of the arcs arrive at similar velocities after a smooth velocity difference decrease.

The mean velocity of Sgr B2 is about ∼ 70 km s −1 and absorption of ammonia toward Sgr A* is at ∼ 0 km s −1 . Despite local deviations, a trend can be observed for velocities to decrease from large ℓ toward Sgr A*. This trend may be extended to the other directions. The 20 km s −1 cloud, for example, is closer to Sgr A* than the 50 km s −1 cloud which itself is closer to the Center of the Galaxy than Sgr B2 at 70 km s −1 . The velocity decline toward Sgr A* may indicate streaming motions along the central bar of the Galaxy (e.g., Blitz & Spergel 1991), or an x 2 orbit along the a 100 pc dust ring described by Molinari et al. (2011) (see also Sect. 4.3). In the first case, if we take the angle of the Galactic bar with respect to the Sun-Sgr A* line of 22 • (Babusiaux & Gilmore 2005), we derive a velocity gradient of the molecular gas at the de-projected distance of Sgr B2 (∼ 270 pc) of ∼ 75 km s −1 along the bar toward Sgr A* (projected, i.e., measured distance and velocity: ∼ 100 pc and ∼ 70 km s −1 ). This corresponds to an average velocity gradient of ∼ 0.28 km s −1 pc −1 . The dynamic timescale for Sgr B2 gas streaming along the bar toward the Galactic Center would be therefore ∼ 3.5 Myr in this picture. If Sgr B2 is on the 100 pc ring (see Sect. 4.3), it will take ∼ 2 Myr to reach a position that is aligned in projection with Sgr A*.

The linewidths of the ammonia emission are in the range of 20-40 km s −1 without significant differences toward individual regions (see Table 1). In Fig. 2 we show the 2 nd moment of the ammonia (1,1) data cube. The very large values in this map, however, are at positions with multiple line components and do not reflect the true velocity dispersions of the ammonia distribution.


### Temperature Map

One of the main goals of this survey is to derive a temperature map of the region between Sgr A* and Sgr B2. As alluded to in the introduction, the ratio of the upper level populations N u for two different inversion lines, (J ′ ,J ′ ) and (J,J), can be expressed by a rotational temperature T rot . This parameter can be derived via the following equation
N u (J ′ , J ′ ) N u (J, J) = g op (J ′ ) g op (J) 2J ′ + 1 2J + 1 exp −∆E T rot,JJ ′ ,(2)
(e.g., Ott et al. 2005). ∆E is the energy difference between the NH 3 (J ′ , J ′ ) and the NH 3 (J, J) levels in K [41.2 K between NH 3 (1,1) and (2,2)], g op are the statistical weights given as g op = 1 for both para-ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions. Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) radiative transfer models (e.g. Ott et al. 2005) show that the population distribution (and thus the temperature) is almost entirely independent of the density of the gas, and the above relation can be used for densities that start at the critical density of ammonia of ∼ 10 3 cm −3 up to extreme densities of ∼ 10 7 cm −3 .

For low temperatures, the rotational temperatures correspond well to kinetic temperatures. At higher energies, however, collisional de-excitation and the dependency of the collisional cross-section on the energy result in a deviation from this trend. LVG calculations suggest that the equation
T kin = 6.06 × exp(0.061 T rot,12 )(3)
provides a reasonable approximation for the conversion from T rot,12 to T kin (see figure 5 in Ott et al. 2011). The relation is flattening at T kin 80 K (T rot,12 ∼ 40 K) and we therefore consider 80 K as the lower limit for all higher temperatures (similar calculations are shown, e.g. in Guesten et al. 1981;Walmsley & Ungerechts 1983;Mauersberger et al. 1986;Danby et al. 1988). To determine higher temperatures more accurately, higher J = K inversion lines need to be observed (e.g. Mills & Morris 2013).

Applying Eq. 3 to our data, we construct a kinetic temperature map of the region between Sgr A* and Sgr B2 which is displayed in Fig. 8. Most of the kinetic gas temperatures, in particular in the molecular arcs between Sgr A* and Sgr B2 are relatively uniform at ∼ 30 K for smaller clouds and about ∼ 50 K for the larger molecular complexes. Hotter molecular gas with temperatures of 80 K are found towards clouds in the vicinity of Sgr A* and in the Sgr B2 region. In particular, across Sgr B2 a temperature gradient is visible with temperatures exceeding 80 K at high Galactic latitude and longitude, and much colder temperatures of ∼ 30 K at lower Galactic latitudes and longitudes. First indications for this gradient have been described in the literature e.g. in Churchwell & Hollis (1983) or Huttemeister et al. (1993), but the gradient was never imaged in this lucidity before.

3.6. Optical Depths As already mentioned, the lines in the observed field are, with ∼ 20 − 40 km s −1 , quite broad. On the other side, our velocity resolution of ∼ 6.3 km s −1 is relatively coarse. Together, both properties of the data make it difficult to determine the strength of the ammonia hyperfine lines that are ∼ ±8 km s −1 and ∼ ±20 km s −1 from the main line. However, for some relatively narrow lines it is possible to detect the hyperfine lines separately and in Fig. 3 lines at positions 2, 6, 11, 19, 24, 25, and 28, do show some indications of the ∼ ±20 km s −1 hyperfine structure. For those lines the main-to-hyperfine line flux ratios are very consistent at a ratio of ∼ 2.2 with only ∼ 20% variation. Using: (Ho & Townes 1983) we derive optical depths τ to be ∼ 2.4 ± 1.
T mb,peak (main lines) T mb,peak (outer hyperfine lines) = 1 − exp(−τ ) 1 − exp(−0.22 τ )(4)
A spectral fit with the NH 3 fitting routines in the CLASS software provide similar optical depths, ranging from about τ ∼ 1 to ∼ 3.5, with the majority in the τ ∼ 1.5 to 2 range. The fits, taking into account the hyperfine line strengths, also result in line widths that are smaller than the measured ones and typically 10-20 km s −1 less than the simple FWHM linewidths.

The calculations of the column densities (Sec. 3.3) assume optically thin ammonia lines. A correction for the sightlines with moderate optical depths can be expressed by τ /(1−exp[−τ ]). For our τ ∼ 1−2.4 cases this amounts to ∼ 1.6 − 2.7. Changes to the temperature, however, are minimal and the correction factors cancel out (Eq. 2) when the optical depths for the (1,1) and (2,2) lines are identical. This is in fact a good assumption since the average temperatures of the gas is at ∼ 38 K (see Sect. 4.4, see also Sect. 3.5), which is in between the energies above ground for the (1,1) [E = 22.7 K] and (2,2) [E = 63.9 K] levels, respectively. In the unlikely edge cases where one of the transitions is optically thin and the other exhibits τ ∼ 2, any temperature corrections would also be close to a factor of ∼ 2, with colder temperatures for higher optical depths of the (1,1) line.


## DISCUSSION


### Comparison to SCUBA observations

In Fig. 9 we show ammonia (1,1) column density contours overlaid on a SCUBA 850 µm map. The absolute flux of the SCUBA data is somewhat uncertain due to the chopping technique used (see Pierce-Price et al. 2000, for a description of the original data) and should be treated as a lower limit since extended flux is likely filtered out. As mentioned in Sect. 2.2, our interferometric ammonia measurements suffer from similar problems and a short spacing correction with single dish data would be required to recover the entire flux of the region. Therefore, on large scales, the comparison of extended emission in both maps will not be very reliable. On more compact scales, on which this paper focuses, however, the data can be compared and the ammonia (1,1) column densities and the SCUBA 850 µm data trace each other extremely well. All features, except for Sgr A* and the ammonia absorption against the compact H ii regions Sgr B2(N) and (M) are reproduced in both datasets. Sgr A* is dominated by non-thermal emission (e.g., Liu & Melia 2001) and is therefore unrelated to dusty molecular gas.

To determine the validity of a dust-to-gas relationship between ammonia and the SCUBA 850 µm data, we determined both fluxes in each pixel (4 ′′ in size) after smoothing to a common resolution of 30 ′′ . Following this, we binned the distribution of the pixels in the NH 3 (1,1) column density versus the SCUBA 850 µm fluxes in order to obtain a point density distribution of these values. The logarithmically scaled point density distribution is shown in Fig. 10. The tip of the contours (largest values in dust and gas) follow an almost linear relation as indicated by the dashed line. The line, however, is not centered on the origin of the plot but shifted along the SCUBA 850 µm axis. This offset may be the result of the missing large scale flux of both maps. However, if the 850 µm flux is underestimated, the line would shift even further away from the origin on this axis. On the other hand, if it is mainly the interferometric ammonia measurements where we miss flux, the graph would shift up and could be brought in agreement with starting at the origin. But such a shift would be extreme as a correction of ∼ 2×10 15 cm −2 is required, a value that would almost double the column density for an average cloud (taking account missing SCUBA flux will increase the difference even further). Temperature variations of gas and dust are unlikely to have a significant effect on the slope of the plot, but could broaden the distribution. We also corrected for the temperature and calculated total ammonia column densities from the (1,1) line and the temperature (via the Eq. A15 in Ungerechts et al. 1986). As listed in Table 2, the (1,1) and (2,2) populations are together about half of the total ammonia column density that we derive from our data. A comparison with the entire ammonia column density thus leads to a very similar plot as the one shown in Fig. 10 and it does not contain a substantial additive component. In addition, 850 µm dust fluxes are not exceedingly susceptible to variations in temperature. The offset of the line may thus be due to a large amount of missing flux from extended emission mainly of the NH 3 (1,1) line. A different explanation for the offset would be that the ammonia forms on dust grains which also shields the material and that a minimum of dust is required to produce ammonia efficiently and to protect it against destruction through the surrounding UV radiation field (see also the discussion in Weiß et al. 2001).


### The Radio Filaments and the Molecular Gas

In contrast to the SCUBA maps, the radio continuum emission and the molecular gas as traced by ammonia show little coincidence. Only the star forming region Sgr B2 exhibits radio continuum emission from the H ii regions at the same positions where large amounts of molecular gas are found (see Fig. 2). For this region it is obvious that the molecular gas most likely feeds the current star forming activity. As already noted by Mehringer et al. (1995), there is much less molecular gas in the star forming Sgr B1 region at (ℓ, b) = (0.50 • , −0.05 • ). This may indicate that the Sgr B1 region is more evolved than Sgr B2 and that the remaining molecular gas has already been dispersed.

In addition, the non-thermal radio arcs at ℓ ∼ 0.15 also occupy a region with only little ammonia line emission. The pistol/sickle region at (0.16 • , −0.06 • ), for example, exhibits NH 3 (1,1) column densities of only ∼ 2 × 10 13 cm −2 . In addition, at larger Galactic latitudes, the radio arc bifurcates into two roughly parallel components at ℓ ∼ 0.19 • and ℓ ∼ 0.17 • . Along the filaments, the NH 3 (1,1) column densities are ∼ 12×10 14 cm −2 , whereas the column density in the very thin, long area in between the two filaments rises up to ∼ 28×10 13 cm −2 . The radio emission in the two arched thermal filaments that connect to the main non-thermal arcs and that stretch from (0.14 • , 0.05 • ) to (0.08 • , 0.00 • ) and from (0.10 • , 0.08 • ) to (0.06 • , 0.02 • ) are also in regions with low NH 3 average column densities. Toward lower Galactic latitude and lower Galactic longitudes, however, very prominent molecular gas clumps are apparent in the integrated intensity maps (c.f. Fig. 2). A notable exception to this behavior is the "handle" of the pistol/sickle, the radio filament that extends roughly perpendicular to the large non-thermal radio arcs at Galactic latitudes of ∼ −0.04 • . Molecular gas appears to be aligned with this feature and exhibits column densities of ∼ 2.4 × 10 14 cm −2 . Finally, the region around Sgr A* with the associated mini-spiral is also very bright in 1.2 cm radio continuum emission but has only weak features of molecular gas. In particular, the very prominent circumnuclear, molecular ring around Sgr A*, which is very bright in HCN (Christopher et al. 2005), is not exceptionally strong in the NH 3 (1,1) and (2,2) transitions (see Sect. 4.6). The ammonia feature has a somewhat larger diameter than that of HCN and column densities of 2 − 4 × 10 14 cm −2 . This is up to an order of magnitude less than the column densities in the 20 and 50 km s −1 clouds. The more isolated radio continuum regions at (−0.013 • , 0.021 • ) and (−0.053 • , 0.020 • ) also show local peaks in the ammonia distribution of a few 10 14 cm −2 . Associated star formation may thus be in a relatively early stage.

4.3. The Molecular Arcs and the 100 pc Dust Ring Some of the most prominent features in the interferometric ammonia map (Fig. 2) are the two molecular arcs west of Sgr B2, between ℓ ≈ 0.2 • and 0.6 • . The two Galactic northern and southern arcs are almost symmetric in shape, mirrored along a line at constant b ≈ −0.02 • . The northern arc is certainly much brighter than the low-b counterpart. In Fig. 9(c) we show an overlay of the ammonia to Spitzer 8 µm data. Some of the detected gas corresponds very well to strong absorption features in the infrared images. In particular the northern arc is heavily absorbing the infrared emission whereas the southern arc is hardly visible in the Spitzer image at all. Similarly, the string of molecular clouds north of Sgr A* are less absorbing than those south of Sgr A*, namely the 20 and 50 km s −1 clouds. This can be interpreted such that the northern arc and the clouds south of Sgr A* are in front of most of the IR emission whereas the southern arc and the clouds north of Sgr A* are located behind. The different structures are indicated by the sinusoidal solid (back structure) and dashed (front) lines in Fig. 4(b) (also in Fig. 7). This picture is consistent with the morphology of the "figure 8" 100 pc ring that was recently detected in a Herschel temperature map by Molinari et al. (2011). The shapes of the dust ring and our ammonia arcs are very similar and the ammonia may thus be emitted by clumps residing in the dust ring. Molinari et al. (2011) claim that the ring is rotating, based on single dish data of the CS molecule. Our data is filtering out the diffuse emission and the clumps seem to follow a somewhat different picture. Whereas the Molinari et al. (2011) interpretation suggests that the foreground arc east of Sgr A* should be redshifted compared to the background arc, we find the opposite. In Fig. 7 the northern, foreground arc (dashed line), is at lower velocities compared the foreground arc (solid line). The velocities of the two arcs are less distinct toward Sgr B2 and at the position of the non-thermal arcs at about b ∼ 0.15 • . This indicates that the structure might be described by an expansion with a velocity of ∼ 30 km s −1 . Signatures for an expansion were also detected in previous CO measurements by (Sofue 1995), albeit at much larger expansion velocities. A comparison of our ammonia data with the intensity-weighted N 2 H + map presented in Jones et al. (2012) corroborates the view gained on the basis of the ammonia data alone, i.e. it appears to contradict the rotating ring picture. Our map, unfortunately, does not cover the region between Sgr A* and Sgr C, which contains the other half of the 100 pc ring at ℓ < 0 • .


### The Temperature Distribution of Molecular Clumps

Due to the filtering effect of the ATCA interferometer, we derive the temperature distribution of molecular clumps more or less directly, with little contribution from diffuse inter-clump gas. In Fig. 11(a), we show the kinetic temperature distribution of all pixels in our map. The distribution peaks at about 38 K and has a FWHM of 43 K, spanning the 18-61 K range. We derive very few areas with a lower limit of kinetic temperatures of > 80 K. Previous studies have detected high temperature components in the Galactic Center molecular gas using single dish telescopes (e.g. Guesten et al. 1981;Huettemeister et al. 1993b;Rodríguez-Fernández et al. 2001;Ao et al. 2013;Mills & Morris 2013). It is very likely that the hot material is mostly diffuse and filtered out by our interferometric observations in combination with that our (1,1) and (2,2) lines are not sensitive to high temperatures. This pronounces the clumpier material which is substantially colder on average. From Fig. 8(b) we may see a trend that smaller clumps exhibit colder temperatures. A different view is shown in Fig. 11 where we plot the logarithm of the total ammonia column density (cf. Sect. 4.1) to the derived kinetic temperature of the gas. The pixel by pixel correlation has been binned and logarithmic contours are shown. The plot confirms that gas at higher column density also tends to show a higher temperature. If the heating is external, one would expect it to affect clouds of all sizes to similar depths. Smaller clumps would thus be more thoroughly heated whereas larger clumps would be able to maintain a colder inner core. Since we see the opposite, we may assume that most of the gas heating takes place internal to the individual clumps. If the star formation rate per molecular gas mass is roughly constant, larger clumps will contain more proto-stars, in particular more massive proto-stars. Those stars are the most likely candidates for internal heating. We hardly detect massive clumps with very low temperatures, or small clumps with large temperatures. Small clumps that do contain massive proto-stars may in fact dissipate relatively quickly, eluding their observation.

The Galactic Center, however, is known to contain external heating sources such as cosmic rays, shocks, a strong UV field, X-ray sources, and dust. As explained above, most of the heating in the clumps is likely internal. But in some places the external heating may play a significant role, even for the smaller clumps. Notably, this includes the bow-shaped region from the thermal, arched filaments, through the high column density 50 km s −1 and 20 km s −1 clouds, in addition to the compact and dense Sgr B 2 region which exhibits a strong temperature gradient (both traced by the yellow and red spots in Fig. 8[a]). The bow-shaped region is close to Sgr A*. Although the CND is cooler (see Sect. 4.6), the warmer gas may be influenced by activity of Sgr A*, which may cause larger X-ray and cosmic ray fluxes, as well as shocks. PDR effects may play a major role in the "mini-starburst" Sgr B2, which is also a place where the x 1 and x 2 orbits of the central stellar bar intersect. The resulting shocks might be an additional heating mechanism for the molecular gas in that area and can potentially explain the Sgr B2 temperature gradient that is hotter at larger Galactic longitude values.


### The Arches and Quintuplet Cluster Regions

Besides the Sgr B regions, young stellar clusters are visible all across the CMZ. Two of the most prominent, massive clusters are the Arches (0.121 • , 0.017 • ) and the Quintuplet (0.160 • , −0.059 • ) clusters displayed in Fig. 12. The clusters have masses of ∼ 10 4 M ⊙ and are with ages of ∼ 2 Myr for the Arches and ∼ 4 Myr for the Quintuple cluster (Figer et al. 1999) relatively young. The different ages may also be reflected in the dense gas map. Close to the Arches cluster, a large filament of dense molecular gas extends roughly parallel to the non-thermal radio continuum filament. The immediate surroundings of the Quintuplet cluster, however, are relatively clear of ammonia and may have dispersed over the lifetime of this cluster. The three-color composite map of the region in Fig. 12 shows how different the distributions of the gas tracers are. CO emission ) is brightest closer in the direction to the Galactic Center and only little is visible in a roughly circular region that is defined by the radio arcs, the pistol/sickle and the thermal arched radio filaments that extend from the non-thermal arc to smaller Galactic longitudes. This region can be roughly described by a circle centered on (ℓ, b) = (0.138 • , −0.007 • ) and having a diameter of 0.08 • (indicated by the cyan circle in Fig. 4[b]). The region, almost entirely surrounded by radio continuum emission appears to be filled with [C I] 3 P 0 − 3 P 1 emitting gas (rest frequency: 492.161 GHz; data from Martin et al. 2004).

[C I] is a well-known tracer for photo-dissociation regions (PDR) and this indicates that the gas is mainly ionized within this cavity. This is supported by the detection of Fe Kα 6.4 keV emission in the region (Wang et al. 2002(Wang et al. , 2006Tatischeff et al. 2012). The gas traced by ammonia is scattered all across that area. The main filaments, however, are close to the radio continuum emission toward the inside of the region. The two stellar clusters are also at the inner edge of the radio continuum emission. The ammonia channel maps (Fig. 5) at this position show signatures that may be interpreted as an expanding structure but the relative velocities could well be due to other motions, too. If it is expanding, the driving force could be provided by the gas traced by [C I]. This scenario would also explain why the morphology and kinematics of the NH 3 emission does not follow the overall sinusoidal pattern that is prominently observed by the molecular arcs between the shell (cyan circle in Fig. 4[b]) and Sgr B2, which is continued south and north of Sgr A* (Sect. 4.3).

The presence of strong [C I] emission also indicates PDR conditions and hence a higher ionizing flux and, since the [C I] emission is widespread, a higher temperature. The temperature map of ammonia (Fig. 8), however, shows values of T kin ∼ 40 − 60 K which are only slightly enhanced compared to other, more quiet regions of the mapped area. The denser gas therefore appears to be well-shielded against heating from ionizing flux. If the picture of an expanding shell structure holds true, the distribution of the different gas tracers may thus indicate that dense gas forms a boundary layer that is filled with ionized and PDR gas (see also the discussion in Sect. 4.2). The dense gas layer is also where the Arches and Quintuplet clusters are located. The radio continuum is emitted in an additional sheet surrounding the dense gas that takes the role of the interface to the unaffected ISM. Substructures are observed close to the stellar clusters and within the radio continuum emission.

The more immediate environment of the Quintuplet cluster is relatively devoid of ammonia emission but has a local peak in [C I]. It also shows radio continuum emission aligned with the outer part of the structure. This emission forms the pistol/sickle region. The situation is less clear for the gas in the immediate surroundings of the Arches cluster. The Arches appears to be located on the rim of a cavity, that is centered on (ℓ, b) ∼ (0.107 • , 0.033 • ) and filled with PDR gas. Since warm, ionized gas follows the path of least resistance, it may originate from the Arches cluster but then accumulate in this substructure.


### The Circumnuclear Disk

The circumnuclear disk around Sgr A* is the most central position in our Milky Way at which substantial amounts of molecular gas are detected. The ring has been mapped in various dense molecular tracers, like HCN (e.g. Christopher et al. 2005;Montero-Castaño et al. 2009;Martín et al. 2012) and shows a characteristic diameter of an arcminute (or about 3 pc) with a total mass of ∼ 10 6 M ⊙ stored in various clumps (Christopher et al. 2005). A temperature map with NH 3 (1,1) column density contours is shown in Fig. 13. We detect a clumpy structure that is in broad agreement with the HCN observations. Herrnstein & Ho (2005) mapped the region in the ammonia lines with the Very Large Array. They detect an even clumpier distribution with their more extended array. With our shorter spacings, we are able to detect the most likely connection of the CND with the 20 km s −1 cloud and possibly the 50 km s −1 cloud (see also McGary et al. 2001). The 20 km s −1 cloud has a velocity gradient and at the position where it connects to the CND, the value is about 40 km s −1 (see Fig. 13). From this level, the values roughly decrease in a clockwise direction around the CND. This indicates that gas is fed from the 20 km s −1 to the CND.

Given that the CND is only ∼ 1.5 pc away from the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, it is surprisingly cold. We detect kinetic temperatures between 25 K in the clumps and a maximum of ∼ 70 K in some inter-clump regions. Our values are much lower than single dish measurements that derive a few hundred K for two regions of the CND (e.g. Requena-Torres et al. 2012). This could indicate that the CND is composed of clumpy cold and diffuse hot material as we are not sensitive to extended emission. The temperature structure of the clumps in the CND is not significantly different from regions further away, e.g. in the molecular arcs (Sect. 4.3). As seen in Fig. 8, the temperatures of the CND are also lower than those in a the warmer bow-shaped region described in Sect. 4.4. Cooling and shielding appears to be more efficient in the CND, if the higher surrounding temperatures are caused by Sgr A*.


## SUMMARY

We observed the region between the supermassive black hole Sgr A* and the massive star forming region Sgr B2 in our Milky Way with the ATCA in the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines (−0.2 • l 0.8 • ;

−0.13 • b 0.07 • ). The interferometric data filters the clumpy structure that otherwise blends with a more diffuse component in single dish observations. We find the following:

• The dense gas is distributed in many filamentary structures with two prominent molecular arcs between Sgr A* and Sgr B2. The dense molecular arcs are likely located on the '100 pc' ring that was recently detected in Herschel dust temperature maps.

• Except for the extreme Sgr B2 region, the 1.2 cm radio continuum and ammonia emission are almost anti-coincident. This includes the continuum emitted from Sgr B1, the non-thermal arcs, the arched, thermal filaments, as well as the mini-spiral around Sgr A*.

• SCUBA 850µm data trace the dense ammonia gas very well, in an almost linear relationship. We see possible indications that a minimum amount of dust may be required for substantial amounts of ammonia to form and survive the encompassing UV radiation field.

• A map of kinetic temperatures is constructed that is reasonably accurate in the 10-80 K range. For some of the gas, in particular gas close to Sgr B2 and in the vicinity of the 20 and 50 km s −1 clouds and the arched, thermal filaments, we derive a lower limit of > 80 K for the kinetic temperature.

• The peak of the kinetic temperature distribution is at ∼ 38 K with a FWHM that spans 18-61 K. On average, larger clumps exhibit larger temperatures than smaller clumps. The dominating heating mechanism is thus likely internal, and possible sources could be proto-stars.

• The molecular gas for the circumnuclear disk immediately surrounding Sgr A* with a radius of ∼ 1.5 pc is likely being supplied by the 20 km s −1 cloud. The CND is cooler than gas in the 20 km s −1 and 50 km s −1 clouds, and gas closer to the arched, thermal filaments.

• The region close to the Arches and Quintuplet clusters shows signs for a layered structure with more diffuse PDR gas that is surrounded by dense ammonia clumps. Furthermore, the radio continuum filaments form an outer layer.

The Galactic Center is an energetic region and understanding the dense gas clumps is key to understanding star formation in extreme conditions. The difference of the diffuse and dense gas components can be revealed by additional single dish observations. Finally it will be desirable to observe higher transitions over the full CMZ to obtain a map of a larger range of temperatures. For example, the NH 3 (2,2) line has an energy of ∼ 64 K above ground, but the (3,3), (6,6) and (9,9) levels are at ∼ 123 K, ∼ 407 K, and ∼ 852 K, respectively, and therefore trace much warmer gas. Other temperature tracers can be used to calibrate all methods against each other. The CMZ is also an important benchmark for comparisons with other galactic nuclei, near and far, active and quiet. Understanding the details of heating and cooling, star formation, AGN feedback and gas transfer in the nearby CMZ is therefore indispensable to understand the role of nuclear regions for galaxy evolution at all cosmic epochs.

Parameters derived from Gaussian fits to the sample spectra. Whenever two velocity components could be distinguished, they are labeled "a" and "b" (ℓ/b: Galactic longitude/latitude in B1950 coordinates; T mb,peak : peak brightness temperature; v LSR,peak : peak LSR velocity; ∆v FWHM : FWHM velocity width, superscripts distinguish between the (1,1) and the (2,2) inversion transition lines).  Scanning pattern of the sub-mosaic fields. Every second row was scanned first in one direction and later the remaining pointings in the orthogonal direction. Each number marks a pointing center of the entire field and numbers in circles indicate those observed in the respective ℓ or b scan. The primary beam size of the ATCA in K-band is ∼ 2. ′ 4, shown in between the two panels. Bottom: Typical uv-coverage for a single mosaic point.  All spectra are at the same scale. NH 3 (1,1) is displayed in thick and NH 3 (2,2) in thin lines. The parameters of the spectra are listed in Tables 1 and 2. (b) An intensity contour per plane of the NH 3 (1,1) emission data cube, color coded by velocity (sometimes referred to as a 'renzogram'). The plot is overlaid on the integrated emission and we indicate two symmetric cosine functions that roughly describe the pattern of the molecular arcs. These features likely delineate the '100 pc' ring. The solid curve describes the molecular arc in the foreground and the dashed curve indicates the arc in the background. The cyan circle denotes a possible cavity close to the site of the Arches and Quintuplet clusters, both clusters are marked as cyan crosses. (c) velocity dispersion (moment 2). Note that double line spectra may show up as artificially high velocity dispersions and also affect the mean velocities.    -Position-velocity map of the NH 3 (1,1) emission. The data cube for this plot is collapsed across Galactic latitude and the peak intensity along that axis is shown in both, greyscale and contours. The black solid and dashed lines indicate the same clouds as outlined in Fig. 4(b).   Arendt et al. 2008). Overlaid on this image are the ammonia (1,1) column density contours and the dotted and dashed white lines correspond to those in Fig. 4[b].   Ammonia (1,1), Blue: C I. Overlaid are the Arches and the Quintuplet stellar clusters in red contours and the 1.2 cm radio continuum in white (see Fig. 2 for the contour spacing). The CO and C I data have been observed with the AST/RO south pole telescope . Shown are the contours of the NH 3 (1,1) column density map in white contours (levels from 10 × 10 13 cm −2 in 10 × 10 13 cm −2 increments), and the 1.2 cm continuum outlining Sgr A* and the mini-spiral in black contours. The grayscale image is the kinetic temperature map. Numbers indicate the peak velocity value at various positions. The 20 km s −1 cloud is located toward smaller Galactic latitudes.
