Fifty-eight percent of the students (58%) reported that they were dissatisfied with their eating habits, and 27.4% tried to control their weight.Several methods of weight control were used, the most frequent (65.4%) were diet and physical exercise, none resorted to laxatives and 8.4% consulted a nutritionist.Self-esteem was very low in 27.1% and low in 34.7% of the students.Overall, the prevalence of orthorexia among our participants was 52.6%.The mean score of the ORTO-15 was 39.19AE4.48.Orthorexia was significantly correlated with the use of weight control measures (p=0.035) and physical activity (p=0.042).Students with low self-esteem had higher tendency for orthorexia but with no significant correlation.Conclusions: Our study supports a non-negligible frequency of orthorexic behaviors in medical students but future studies are needed to assess the direct effect of self-esteem on orthorexia.

Introduction: Evidence is growing for the bio-immuno-metabolic model of pathogenesis in anorexia nervosa (AN), an eating disorder with a chronic and relapsing nature.The role of the gut microbiome in this process is also receiving intense research interest.The gut microbiome and the use of probiotics and prebiotics have been extensively studied in gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional GI disorders (FGIDs).Exploring links between AN and these GI disorders may open new avenues of treatment such as the use of probiotics and prebiotics in AN.Objectives: This review explores: i) GI presentation in AN and its relationship with the gut microbiome ii) factors influencing the gut microbiome presentation in AN including dietary patterns iii) whether the gut microbiome may be involved in the pathogenesis and maintenance of AN iv) gut microbiome presentation in GI disorders and commonalities with AN v) evidence for the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics as adjunct treatment in AN.Methods: GI symptomatology and gut microbiome presentation in AN were examined through literature searches.Gut microbiome changes related to common dietary patterns in AN were explored.Microbiome changes that may influence development or maintenance of AN were considered.Microbiome alterations seen in relevant GI disorders were explored and commonalities considered between these and alterations in the microbiome in AN.Literature searches were performed for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in AN and relevant GI disorders.

Introduction: Obesity is a major public health problem and some developed countries have declared it 'the modern day epidemic'.One of the major eating disorders that leads to obesity is BED, which involves consuming large quantities of high carbohydrate food.Studying the factors that cause and contribute to BED can help tackle this major health hazard and alleviate a huge burden on the nationalized health service.Objectives: To determine the frequency of Binge Eating Disorder (BED) among obese adults, and to study its relationship to depression, anxiety, life stressors, personality and self esteem.Methods: The sample was a randomised sample of clinically obese individuals, body mass index (BMI) of 30 and above.The sample was collected from two sites; Nutrition Clinic in Student's Hospital, Cairo University and a Private Nutrition Centre.250 cases were recruited over one year.All patients were subjected to a clinical interview derived from Kasr El Aini sheet , and measurement of Waist-Hip Ratio.Assessment of depression and anxiety was through Beck Depression Inventory , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale(TMAS).Other tools used were the Eysenck's Personality Inventory, Eating Disorder Inventory -2.

Results: BED among obese adults was 48%; 83 % of them had drive for thinness, 25% were bulimics, 45 % had ineffectiveness feeling.Also 83 % had body dissatisfaction, 8% were perfectionism seeking, 43 % showed interpersonal distrust and 25% presented maturity fears.Impulsivity was scored high in 25% , 66.6%had social insecurity and 77% had severe Extraversion.All were statistically significant.On the other hand there were no statistical significant difference between obese adults with BED and those without on TMAS.Half percent of participants with BED and 34.6 percent of participant without BED had moderate level of anxiety.In addition , there were no significant difference between obese participants with BED and those without BED according to BDI.However, 83.3% of obese cases with BED while 60 % for those without BED had manifest depression ranging from mild to severe depression.Conclusions: Obese adults with BED have more drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, feeling of ineffectiveness, perfectionism seeking, interpersonal distrust, maturity fears and social insecurity than non BED.Extraversion and Neuroticism are also more among BED.There were no significance different between both group in relation to Anxiety and Depression.Introduction: Eating Disorders (EDs) as a public health concern were explored by numerous studies, where attention was drawn to further exploration of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) in non-western countries due to the existing gap in the area (Cummins et al., 2005;Javier & Belgrave, 2019).The studies emphasized the importance of exploring the perceptions and attitudes of healthcare practitioners in order to improve the quality of medical care for people who have AN (Atti et al., 2020;Colmsee et al., 2021;Costa-Val et al., 2019;Ghaderi et al., 2020;Jafar & Morgan 2021;Kohrt et al., 2020;Reas et al., 2021).Little research related to EDs in Central Asia has been found among previous literature.This study contributes to further research in this area taking into account societal and cultural specifics existing in Kyrgyzstan.Objectives: Healthcare practitioners are accessible for the majority of the population of Bishkek through the local primary healthcare (PHC) structure.Therefore, the perceptions of the local PHC workers were explored within the present study.The aim of the current research was to explore how primary healthcare practitioners perceive AN and people who have AN in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.Methods: Six semi-structured interviews with six PHC workers who currently provide medical care for the local population were conducted in accordance with the Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA).The results were discussed in frames of the Social Constructionism theory.Results: The interviews uncovered major themes which show how the participants perceive AN and people with AN.According to the participants, AN develops due to stress.Families of AN patients carry the heavy burden of the disorder.The participants described how local and western socio-cultural standards influence the development of AN and seeking treatment process.AN patients do not want to be treated due to the stigmatization of mental health area within the local population and self-stigmatization of mental health disorders.However, the participants themselves have both positive and negative attitudes towards the mental healthcare.Conclusions: The participants represent local societal perceptions and attitudes related to EDs and AN among medical professionals in accordance with the social constructionism theory.Overall, the PHC physicians in Bishkek have positive attitudes towards AN patients.They feel compassionate towards people who need their professional help.However, the participants feel like they are not able to provide the appropriate medical help for the population with AN due to the way PHC structure in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan functions.Local PHC practitioners do not receive enough resources to provide medical care for people with mental health issues in general.The important discourse uncovered within the present study is the attention brought to the local PHC structure.

The use of new technology in prevention and treatment of psychiatric diseases -preliminary results


## Introduction:

The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious global public health issue with wide-ranging negative effects on people's lives, which is reflected in steadily rising mental health problems.In order to appropriately respond to the increased occurrence of psychiatric illness, protect mental health and strengthen resilience it is necessary to include new technologies, such as extended reality (XR) or socially assistive robots (SAR) in not only psychiatric European Psychiatry S853
