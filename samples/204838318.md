We present measurements of spectral properties for a total of about 500,000 quasars selected from the fourteenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR14) quasar catalog. We performed a careful and homogeneous analysis of the SDSS spectra of these sources, to estimate the continuum and line properties of several emission lines such as Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Mg ii, C iii], C iv and Lyα. From the derived emission line parameters we estimated single-epoch virial black hole masses (M BH ) for the sample using Hβ, Mg ii and C iv emission lines. The sample covers a wide range in bolometric luminosity (log L bol ; erg s −1 ) between 44.3 and 47.3 and log M BH between 6.8 and 10.2 M . Using the ratio of L bol to the Eddington luminosity as a measure of the accretion rate, the logarithm of the accretion rate is found to be in the range between −2.51 and 0.89. We performed several correlation analyses between different emission line parameters and found them to match with that known earlier using smaller samples. We noticed that strong Fe ii sources with large Balmer line width, and highly accreting sources with large M BH are rare in our sample. We make available online an extended and complete catalog that contains various spectral properties derived in this work along with other properties culled from the SDSS-DR14 quasar catalog.

## INTRODUCTION

Quasars, a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion of matter onto a super massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk (Antonucci 1993). The availability of a large number of quasars with measured line and continuum properties is of paramount importance in a wide variety of astrophysical research such as galaxy evolution, black hole growth etc. For example, the mass of the black holes (M BH ) in AGN is found to be strongly correlated with host galaxies velocity dispersion suggesting the co-evolution of black hole and host galaxy (Kormendy & Ho 2013). Thus, measuring M BH for a large sample of quasars is required to study the growth and evolution of black hole across cosmic time. A direct method to measure M BH in quasars over a large range of redshifts is via the technique of reverberation mapping (Blandford & McKee 1982;Peterson 1993) and reverberation mapping studies show a suvenduat@gmail.com strong correlation between the quasar monochromatic luminosity (L) at 5100Å and the size (R) of the broad line region (BLR) (Kaspi et al. 2000;Peterson et al. 2004;Bentz et al. 2013). Since reverberation mapping requires long-term monitoring campaign and difficult for high redshift objects, the size-luminosity (R − L) relation has been used to estimate M BH from the singleepoch spectrum having a monochromatic luminosity and emission line width measurements (e.g., Woo & Urry 2002;Shen et al. 2011). The values of M BH estimated from single-epoch spectrum is found to be consistent with the reverberation mapping M BH estimates (Grier et al. 2017).

Also, statistical studies of quasars will help in a better understanding of quasar properties (Urry & Padovani 1995;Kellermann et al. 1989) such as the quasar luminosity function (Richards et al. 2006b), black hole mass function, which shows a peak at z ∼ 2 (Vestergaard & Osmer 2009;Kelly et al. 2010), and the Eddington ratio distribution, which peaks at L bol /L Edd ∼ 0.05 (Kelly et al. 2010), where, L bol is the bolometric luminosity and arXiv:1910.10395v1 [astro-ph.GA] 23 Oct 2019 L Edd = 1.3 × 10 38 (M BH /M ) erg s −1 is the Eddington luminosity. Several correlations between continuum and emission line properties in quasars are available, e.g., the anti-correlation between line equivalent width (EW) and continuum luminosity (Baldwin 1977), especially strong in C iv and Mg ii lines (Shen et al. 2011), correlations between continuum luminosity and line widths and luminosities, etc (e.g., Boroson & Green 1992;Greene & Ho 2005;Shen et al. 2011;Rakshit et al. 2017;Calderone et al. 2017). Also, studies of the emission lines from AGN will help in enhancing our understanding on the physical conditions of the gas close to the central regions of AGN (Osterbrock 1989).

All of the above studies require large number of quasars. Since the discovery of quasars about more than half a century ago (Schmidt 1963), the number of quasars that are known has increased gradually. A significant increase in the number of quasars happened in the last two decades with the bulk of the contribution coming from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). In addition to SDSS, other surveys too have contributed to the increase in the number of quasars such as the 2dF quasar redshift survey (2QZ; Croom et al. 2004), the bright quasar survey (Schmidt & Green 1983) and the large bright quasar survey (LBQS; Hewett et al. 1995). Also, the number of quasars is expected to increase manifold in the future from the next generation large optical imaging survey using the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST; Ivezić et al. 2019Ivezić et al. , 2014. In spite of the many quasar surveys that are available, SDSS has provided us with the largest homogeneous sample of quasars with optical spectra. The latest report from Pâris et al. (2018) has provided a catalog of 526,356 quasars over 9376 degree 2 region of the sky from SDSS. This quasar catalog significantly increases the number of quasars compared to the earlier catalogs from SDSS -DR5 (Shen et al. 2008), SDSS-DR7 (hereafter S11; Shen et al. 2011), and SDSS-DR10 (hereafter C17; Calderone et al. 2017). Though Pâris et al. (2018) catalog of quasars contain X-ray, UV, optical, IR and radio imaging properties of the quasars wherever available, they lack spectral information of the sources. However, knowledge of the spectral properties of the sample of quasars in Pâris et al. (2018) is needed to address various problems in quasar research. In this paper, we carried out detailed spectral modeling of all the quasars cataloged in Pâris et al. (2018) and provide a new catalog of continuum and emission line properties of quasars along with M BH and Eddington ratio. This paper is structured as follows. Our data and spectral analysis procedures are described in section 2. We compare our measurements with the previous works and present the catalog in section 3. We discuss some applications of the catalog in section 4 with a summary in section 5. A cosmology with H 0 = 70 km s −1 Mpc −1 , Ω m = 0.3, and Ω λ = 0.7 is assumed throughout.


## DATA AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

We started with the SDSS DR14 quasar catalog (version "DR14Q v4 4") by Pâris et al. (2018, hereafter DR14Q), which includes all the spectroscopically confirmed quasars observed during any SDSS data release, consisting of 526,356 quasars having i-band absolute magnitude M i (z = 2) < −20.5 and either at least one emission line with full width at half maximum (FWHM) larger than 500 kms −1 or showing interesting/complex absorption features. It was constructed from SDSS-DR14 (Abolfathi et al. 2018) and a major part of the newly discovered quasars in DR14Q are from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) of SDSS IV (Myers et al. 2015). A detailed description of DR14Q can be found in Pâris et al. (2018).

To measure the spectral information of the quasars in DR14Q, we first downloaded all the reduced spectra from the SDSS database * . We then analysed each spectrum using the publicly available multi-component spectral fitting code PyQSOfit † developed by Guo et al. (2018). A detailed description of the code and its applications can be found in Guo et al. (2019) and Shen et al. (2019). First, we corrected each spectrum for Galactic extinction using the Schlegel et al. (1998) map and a Milky Way extinction law of Fitzpatrick (1999) with R V = 3.1. We then transformed the observed spectrum to the rest frame using the redshift value provided in DR14Q. Finally, we performed multi-component spectral fitting to each spectrum.


### Continuum components

The light from stars in the host-galaxy of a quasar can contribute to the observed quasar's spectrum, particularly significant for low-z quasars (z < 0.8). Thus, to extract intrinsic AGN properties, the host galaxy contribution to each spectrum must be removed. We, therefore, carried out host galaxy-quasar decomposition to the spectra for z < 0.8 quasars based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method of Yip et al. (2004a,b) inbuilt in the PyQSOfit code. We used the global model (independent of redshift and luminosity) with 5 PCA components for galaxies that can reproduce ∼98% galaxy spectra and 10 PCA components for quasars that can reproduce ∼96% quasars spectra. We then subtracted the host contribution, if present, from each spectrum (see Guo et al. 2018 Figure 1. Examples of spectral decomposition. Top: An example of a quasar spectrum with significant host galaxy contribution. Also, shown here are the SDSS data (black), the best fit quasar+host galaxy template (pink), host galaxy subtracted spectrum (grey) and decomposed host galaxy (purple). Bottom: An example of a quasar spectrum without significant host galaxy contribution. The power law + polynomial continuum (blue), Fe ii (magenta), broad line (green), narrow line (blue) and the total best fit model (red), which is a sum of fcont+line are shown in each panel. A zoomed version of individual complex is shown below each panel.   Using the host-galaxy subtracted spectrum, we modelled the entire continuum, masking prominent emission lines as
f cont = f pl + f poly + f BC + f Fe ii(1)
where the power law continuum (f pl ) is
f pl = β λ/λ 0 α ,(2)
and the polynomial continuum (f poly ) is
f poly = 3 i=1 a i (λ − λ 0 ) i .(3)
with a reference wavelength λ 0 = 3000Å. The parameters α, β and a i are the power-law slope, normalization and polynomial coefficient, respectively. The Balmer continuum (f BC ; Grandi 1982;Dietrich et al. 2002) is defined as
f BC = F BE B λ (T e ) 1 − e −τ λ (λ/λBE) 3(4)
where τ λ is the optical depth at the Balmer edge of wavelength λ BE = 3646Å , B λ (T e ) is the Planck function at the electron temperature T e and F BE is the normalized flux density. The Fe ii model (f Fe ii ) is
f Fe ii = b 0 F Fe ii (λ, b1, b2),(5)
where b 0 , b1, b2 are the normalization, Gaussian boarding and wavelength shift parameters of the Fe ii model to fit the data. Both the UV and optical Fe ii emission were modeled. The UV Fe ii template (1200−3500Å ) was taken from Vestergaard & Wilkes (2001), Tsuzuki et al. (2006) and Salviander et al. (2007). The optical Fe ii template (3686−7484Å ) was based on Boroson & Green (1992).

Since various components were used in the continuum modeling process, the fitting process has degeneracy. Hence, we used
f cont =    f pl + f poly + f Fe ii , if z ≤ 0.35 f pl + f BC + f Fe ii , otherwise
Furthermore, for sources with z > 1.1, the Balmer component resembles a power law. Thus, following previous studies (e.g., Dietrich et al. 2003;Shin et al. 2019), we fixed T e = 15, 000 K, τ λ = 1 and allowed F BE to vary between 0 and 0.3 × F 3675 , where F 3675 was determined at λ = 3675Å, where the Fe ii contribution is insignificant.

The best fit continuum model was subtracted from each spectrum leading to only the line spectrum. Individual line complex was fitted separately, while all emission lines within a line complex were fitted together. The full list of emission lines and the number of Gaussian components used for individual line are given in Table 1. Broad emission line profiles in many objects can be very complex (e.g., asymmetric, disc like) and can not be well represented by a single Gaussian. Moreover, the line width estimated by a single Gaussian model is systematically larger by 0.1 dex compared to the multiple Gaussian model (Shen et al. 2008(Shen et al. , 2011. Thus, following previous studies, we used multiple Gaussians to model broad emission line profiles (e.g., Greene & Ho 2005;Shen et al. 2011). During the fitting, the velocity and width of all the narrow components in Hβ and Hα complex were tied together with an added constraint that the maximum allowed FWHM of narrow components is 1200 km s −1 , while the broad components have FWHM > 1200 km s −1 . Furthermore, the flux ratios of [O iii] and [N ii] doublets were fixed to their theoretical values, i.e., F (5007)/F (4959) = 3 and F (6585)/F (6549) = 3. Note that, we did not use any narrow component to model C iii] and C iv emission lines, and the line FWHM and flux were determined from the whole line because of ambiguity in the presence of narrow component in these lines (also see Shen et al. 2011Shen et al. , 2019. Many high-z spectra were affected by broad and narrow absorption lines that could bias the line fitting results, hence, we iterated the continuum fitting to remove the pixels that fall below 3σ. A few example of the spectral decompositions is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Note that due to the large number of quasars, visual inspection of all the spectral fittings was not possible. Thus, only random checks were made. All the spectral fitting plots are made publicly available for the users ( care should be taken when using the fitting results of very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) spectrum.)

We measured the continuum (slope, luminosity) and emission line (line peak, FWHM, EW, luminosity, etc.) properties from the best fit model ‡ . The uncertainty in each parameter was estimated using Monte Carlo approach. We generated 50 mock spectra for each object by adding Gaussian noise to the original spectrum considering the associated flux uncertainty at each pixel. We then calculated 1σ dispersion from the distribution of each parameter obtained from 50 mock spectra and considered it as measurement uncertainty. We calculated L bol from the monochromatic luminosity using the bolometric correction factor from Richards et al. (2006a) and S11
L bol =        9.26 × L 5100 , if z < 0.8 5.15 × L 3000 , if 0.8 ≤ z < 1.9 3.81 × L 1350 , if z ≥ 1.9
Note that the above correction factors are derived from the mean spectral energy distribution of AGN and using a single value could lead to 50% uncertainty in L bol measurements (Richards et al. 2006a).

In Figure 3, we plot L bol against redshift for DR14 quasars. The DR7 quasars from S11 are also shown. As mentioned in Pâris et al. (2018), the peak of the redshift distribution at z ∼ 2.5 is due to the quasars observed by SDSS-III to access Lyα forest while the peaks at z ∼ 0.8 and 1.6 are due to the known degeneracy in the quasars target selection (see also Ross et al. 2012). The bolometric luminosity has a mean of log(L bol ) = 45.91 ± 0.56 erg s −1 with a range of 44.32 − 47.32 erg s −1 (3σ around the median). A large fraction of low-luminosity quasars are included in DR14 compared to DR7. For example, the fraction of quasars with log L bol < 46 erg s −1 in DR14 is about 54% compared to 27% in DR7.

We included the commonly used BALnicity Index (BI; Weymann et al. 1991) and its uncertainty from the SDSS DR14 quasars catalog of Pâris et al. (2018) to flag the broad absorption line quasars (BAL-QSOs) in this work. Due to the large sample of quasars, visual inspection of and 95 percentile density contours along with density maps are shown. The redshift and bolometric luminosity distributions are also shown for DR14 quasars sample (empty histogram, this work) along with DR7 quasars (filled histogram, S11). A large fraction of high redshift and low luminous quasars were targeted by DR14 compared to DR7.

all spectra was not done by Pâris et al. (2018) to confirm BAL features in DR14Q and a fully automated detection of BAL for all z > 1.57 quasars were performed focusing on C iv absorption troughs. A total of 21,876 quasars with C iv absorption troughs wider than 2000 km s −1 is present in this work. We note that the actual number of BALQSOs could be larger.

All the parameters and their uncertainties are compiled into a catalog, which is described in section A and Table A1, containing 229 columns. We also provide an extended catalog where we appended all other information from Pâris et al. (2018), which include multi-band imaging properties, thereby leading to 335 columns in our extended catalog.


## COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS WORKS

We compared our measurements with S11 and C17 catalogs. The former catalog is based on all DR7 quasars with 105,783 entries while the later is based on DR10 quasars up to z = 2 with 71,251 entries. Although different methods were used by both the authors than the PyQSOfit code used in our analysis, a comparison can be made. We refer the readers to Calderone et al. (2017) for a discussion on S11 and C17 spectral analysis methods. We cross-matched our catalog with S11 and C17  Figure 4. Comparison of continuum luminosity measurements between our work and S11 and C17 for all the common quasars. The inner and outer contours are the 1σ and 2σ density contours. The one-to-one line is also shown.

using TOPCAT § (Taylor 2005), and took only the common entries for comparison.

In Figure 4, we compare our continuum luminosity measurements with S11 and C17 where our measurements are plotted along the x-axis in the left panels. We also plot the distribution of measurements for all three catalogs in the right panels. In general, we found excellent agreement between the measurements. The mean and standard deviation of the difference between this work and S11 (C17) is 0.001 ± 0.108 (0.018 ± 0.098) dex for L 1350 , −0.067 ± 0.067 (−0.003 ± 0.063) dex for L 3000 and −0.060 ± 0.131 (0.084 ± 0.203) dex for L 5100 . We notice a larger difference in the estimates of L 5100 compared to other luminosities between S11, C17 and our work. Our estimates of L 5100 lying in between S11 and C17. We attribute this difference due to differences in the host galaxy subtraction procedures. For example, S11 did not perform host galaxy decomposition, thus, their measurements are contaminated by the host § http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/ mbt/topcat/ galaxy contribution. As a consequence, a strong anticorrelation between continuum spectral slope and L 5100 is found in S11. On the other hand, C17 used a single 5 Gyr old elliptical galaxy template to subtract the host galaxy contribution, while, we used PCA method inbuilt in PyQSOfit to subtract the host galaxy (see section 2.1).

In Figure 5, we compare the Hβ (top), Mg ii (middle) and C iv (bottom) line luminosity measurements between all three catalogs. In all cases, we found strong agreement. The mean and standard deviation of Hβ line luminosity between this work and S11 (C17) are −0.046 ± 0.146 (0.035 ± 0.160) dex, while the same for Mg ii and C iv line luminosities are 0.104 ± 0.100 (0.065 ± 0.115) dex and −0.034 ± 0.142 (0.027 ± 0.165) dex, respectively. All the line luminosity plots show a strong correlation with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient r s > 0.95 for both Hβ and Mg ii lines, while 0.93 (0.90) for C iv line luminosity between this work and SII (C17). However, the emission line widths in different catalogs are less strongly correlated ( Figure 6) having r s = 0.82 (0.63) for Hβ, 0.75 (0.73) for Mg ii and 0.67 (0.30) for C iv between this work and S11 (C17). The mean and standard deviation between this work and S11 (C17) is −0.036 ± 0.139 (−0.136 ± 0.201) dex for Hβ, −0.002 ± 0.126 (−0.069 ± 0.151) dex for Mg ii and −0.055 ± 0.163 (−0.162 ± 0.244) dex for C iv line width measurement. Though our measurements are in good agreement with S11, C17 have in general larger line FWHM compared to this work and S11. About ∼ 8% of the sources in C17 have Hβ FWHM larger than 14,000 km s −1 (these objects may hit the upper limit of FWHM in broad line, which is 15,000 km s −1 in C17), while the same for S11 and this work is only ∼1 % and 0.5%, respectively. This produces a strong spike in the line width distribution for C17 ( Figure 6). The discrepancy is due to the use of different spectral decomposition methods e.g., both S11 and this work use multiple broad Gaussian components up to 3 to represent the broad lines while C17 first used a single Gaussian component to represent a broad 'known' line and later added multiple Gaussians to represent 'unknown' emission lines, if present close to the 'known' line (see Calderone et al. 2017, for more details). The spectral catalog generated in this work for a large number of quasars can be used to investigate the correlation between various line and continuum properties in detail. Here, we studied some of the correlations. The luminosity of Balmer lines show strong correlation with monochromatic 5100Å continuum luminosity over a wide range of redshift and luminosity suggesting the physical mechanism behind the correlation are same in different AGN across all redshift and luminosity range (e.g., Greene & Ho 2005;Jun et al. 2015;Rakshit et al. 2017). In Figure 7, we plot the luminosity of Hα (top panel) and Hβ (middle panel) against L 5100 . In both cases, a strong correlation is found with r s of 0.90 and 0.79, respectively. We performed linear regression analysis with measurement errors on both axes using Bayesian  Table 2. The 20, 40, 68 and 95 percentile density contours are also shown.  


## APPLICATIONS


### Correlation analysis

log L(Hβ) = (0.900 ± 0.002) log L(5100) + (2.51 ± 0.08) (7) with an intrinsic scatter of 0.033 ± 0.001 and 0.045 ± ¶ https://github.com/jmeyers314/linmix 0.001, respectively. These correlations are shown by the black dashed line in Figure 7. For equation 6, a linear regression using bces * * (Akritas & Bershady 1996;Nemmen et al. 2012) gives a slope (m) of 1.163 ± 0.006 and intercept (c) of −8.59±0.27 considering log L(5100) as the independent variable (blue dashed-dot line) and m= 1.271 ± 0.008 and c= −13.36 ± 0.36 for orthogonal least squares (magenta-dashed line). The same for equation 7 is found to be 0.886 ± 0.003 and 3.16 ± 0.13 (m, c) for log L(5100) as independent variable and m= 1.021 ± 0.007 and c= −2.83 ± 0.33 for orthogonal least squares.

The correlation between L[OIII] − L(5100) has been widely used to estimate bolometric luminosity for Type 2 AGN since their host galaxy contamination prevent reliable estimation of L 5100 (see Kauffmann et al. 2003;Heckman et al. 2004). However, this relation has a large scatter (Heckman et al. 2004;Shen et al. 2011). The L([O III]λ5007) as a function of L 5100 is plotted in the bottom panel (r s = 0.59) of Figure 7. The best-fit linear regression using linmix gives log L[OIII] = (0.707 ± 0.003) log L(5100) + (10.67 ± 0.13) (8) with an intrinsic scatter of 0.104 ± 0.001, respectively. But the same using bces is found to be m= 0.680±0.003 and c= 11.88±0.15 when log L(5100) is the independent variable, and m= 0.969 ± 0.012 and c= −0.957 ± 0.53 for orthogonal least squares. Using only objects having a good quality spectra with continuum median SNR > 10 pixel −1 , we obtained a slightly steeper slope of m= 0.836 ± 0.006 using linmix.

In Figure 8, we plot various such line and continuum quantities and performed correlation analysis between them. We only included objects with line (or continuum) SNR > 5 pixel −1 for this analysis. The fits to the data are shown by dashed lines in Figure 8 and the results of the fitting are given in Table 2. We found a strong correlation between Mg ii and Hβ broad line width (Jun et al. 2015), anti-correlation between EW and continuum luminosity for both C iv and Mg ii lines (Baldwin 1977), and correlation between EW and FWHM in Mg ii line (Dong et al. 2009). Note that the correlation analysis is sensitive to the spectral quality, especially, low SNR spectra (< 5 pixel −1 ) can bias the results (see Shen et al. 2011, for a detailed discussion).

The main parameters of the well-known 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1; Boroson & Green 1992;Sulentic et al. 2000bSulentic et al. , 2002 are the FWHM of broad Hβ line and R Fe ii defined by the ratio of the EW of Fe ii (4435−4685Å )  to Hβ broad line. These two quantities are plotted in Figure 9 for all objects in the catalog with valid measurements. Firstly, quasars with a wide range of Fe ii strength can be found at a given FWHM (Hβ). Similarly, at a given Fe ii strength, the Hβ can have a large range. The R FeII distribution peaks at ∼ 0.6 which can be occupied by quasars with FWHM(Hβ) of ∼ 1000 − 10, 000 km s −1 . This dispersion is suggested to be due to an orientation effect (see Shen & Ho 2014;Sun & Shen 2015). Secondly, the popular trend of decreasing FWHM and increasing R FeII is noticed as also shown in previous studies (e.g., Shen et al. 2011;Coffey et al. 2019). Thus, quasars with a very broad Hβ line and strong Fe ii strength is rare, especially in the low redshift SDSS sample. However, IR spectroscopic study of high-z quasars shows a systematically larger FWHM(Hβ) compared to the low-z sources at high R FeII (Shen 2016). The dashed line represents the separation of quasars into two populations; the population A (FWHM(Hβ) broad ≤ 4000 km s −1 ) sources with strong Fe ii and soft X-ray excess, and population B (FWHM(Hβ) broad > 4000 km s −1 ) sources with weak Fe ii and a lack of soft X-ray excess (Sulentic et al. 2000a).

Previous studies found an anti-correlation between [O iii] and Fe ii emission, i.e., objects with strong [O iii] are found to be weak Fe ii emitters and vice versa (e.g., Boroson & Green 1992;Grupe et al. 1999;McIntosh et al. 1999;Rakshit et al. 2017) although Véron-Cetty et al. (2001) found such anti-correlation is very weak. In Figure 10, we plot R5007, i.e. the ratio of EW of [O III]5007 to the total Hβ (sum of broad and narrow Hβ components) against R Fe ii (left) and EW of Fe ii (right). We found that the anti-correlation, although weak, is present with correlation coefficient r s = −0.17 between R5007 and R Fe ii , while the R5007 vs. EW (Fe ii) anticorrelation is moderately stronger with r s = −0.33 indicating that the strong Fe ii sources may have weak [O iii] emission or vice versa.

The value of M BH in an AGN can be estimated using virial relation from single-epoch spectrum having continuum luminosity and line width measurements as follows log M BH M = A + B log λL λ 10 44 erg s −1 + 2 log FWHM km s −1 (9) where A and B are constants empirically calibrated by various authors using reverberation mapping R −L relations of local AGN (Kaspi et al. 2000(Kaspi et al. , 2005Bentz et al. 2013) Woo et al. 2018) and C iv with Mg ii or Hβ (e.g., Vestergaard & Peterson 2006;Assef et al. 2011;Park et al. 2017). In this work, we used the black hole mass calibrations from Vestergaard & Peterson (2006, thereafter VP06), Assef et al. (2011, thereafter A11), Vestergaard & Osmer (2009, thereafter VO09) and S11. We caution that the derived virial M BH values could have uncertainty > 0.4 dex due to the different systematics involved in the calibrations used, which has not been taken in to account. The uncertainties in the virial M BH values that are provided in the catalog are only the measurement uncertainties calculated via error propagation of Equation 9. In Figure 11 we compare M BH calculated using different lines. We plot Mg ii based black hole masses against Hβ (upper left) and the ratio of the two masses (lower panels). Using Mg ii mass calibrations from S11 we found slightly larger offsets (−0.09 dex) and dispersion (0.29 dex) compared to VO09 calibration (offset=−0.06 dex, dispersion=0.28 dex). Similarly, the same for C iv masses against Mg ii masses is shown in the right panels. Here, we see a larger offset when Mg ii calibration of S11 was used compared to VO09. Hence, in the catalog, we have provided virial M BH values calculated based on (a) Hβ line (for z < 0.8) using the calibration of VP06, (b) Mg ii line (for 0.8 ≤ z < 1.9) using the calibration provided by VO09, and (c) C iv line (for z ≥ 1.9) using VP06 calibration. A detailed calibration of black hole masses will be presented elsewhere.

We estimated Eddington ratio (R Edd ), which is the ratio of bolometric (L bol ) to Eddington luminosity (L Edd ). The values of M BH and Eddington ratios for all quasars are also provided in the catalog. In Figure 12, we plot R Edd against M BH . Firstly, the accretion rate decreases with increasing M BH and highly accreting quasars with massive black holes are rare. Secondly, low accreting and low mass black holes are also rare due to the flux limit of SDSS. The distribution of R Edd and M BH is also plotted. The mean of the log M BH distribution is 8.64 ± 0.55 M having a range of 6.8 − 10.2 M (3σ around the median) and the log R Edd distribution has a mean of −0.86±0.52 with a range of −2.51 to 0.89.


## SUMMARY

We have carried out detailed spectral decomposition, that include host galaxy subtraction, AGN continuum and emission line modeling for more than 500,000 quasars spectra from SDSS DR14 quasar catalog and estimated spectral properties such as line flux, FWHM, wavelength shift, etc. We estimated virial M BH and Eddington ratios for the quasars. We performed various correlation analysis to show the applicability of the measurements presented in this work in a larger context. The strong Fe ii emitters with larger line FWHM, and highly accreting high mass sources are found to be rare in this large sample of quasars. In particular, we found the well-known inverse correlation between EW and continuum flux in C iv and Mg ii, and the strong correlation between Balmer line and continuum luminosity. We provide all the measurements in the form of a catalog, which is the largest catalog containing the spectral properties of quasars till date. This catalog will be of immense use to the community to study various properties of quasars.

‡ For 89 out of the 526,356 quasars in DR14Q, there is insufficient or no valid data points in the spectrum to perform spectral decomposition, and therefore, these objects were excluded in this work.
* * https://github.com/rsnemmen/BCES
We provide two catalogs:1. The main catalog is based on only the spectral information from this study consisting of having 229 columns.The format is shown below.2. An extended catalog where all the columns of DR14Q(Pâris et al. 2018) is appended after the main catalog (i.e., after column #229). The extended catalog has a total of 335 columns.Both the catalogs along with other supplemental materials will be made publicly available.
