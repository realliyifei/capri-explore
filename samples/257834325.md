Prolonged response to first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor in a metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harbouring complex G719X and S768I mutations: A case report from Vietnam and literature review
10.1002/rcr2.1131C A S E R E P O R T Associate Editor: David Lam
A complex of G719X and S768I mutations is infrequently observed, constituting less than 0.3% of all EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the response to first-line TKIs is inconsistent in the literature. In this study, we report a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer carrying rare EGFR compound mutations of G719X and S768I who benefited from first-line treatment with gefitinib in Vietnam. This patient had a prolonged response lasting over 44 months with first-generation TKI. He continued to take gefitinib without experiencing serious adverse events. NSCLC with a rare complex of G719X and S768I mutation revealed a good response to gefitinib. K E Y W O R D S first-generation TKIs, G719X and S768I mutations, NSCLC, rare EGFR mutation

## INTRODUCTION

Lung cancer is among the most common and fatal cancers in the world. 1 The comprehension of molecular pathways involved in lung cancer development has led to the development of targeted therapies that are focused on the correct gene mutations in genes. The EGFR mutation is one of the most common genetic alterations in non-small cell lung cancer, with prevalence rates ranging from 22% to 62% in Asian countries. The evolution of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has led to significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), particularly in patients with sensitizing mutations like the deletion of exon 19 or the L858R point mutation in exon 21. [2][3][4][5] However, the efficacy of first-generation TKIs for uncommon EGFR mutations is still unknown. Our patient was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma that harboured a rare combination of EGFR mutations (G719X and S768I), the patient experienced a successful response to first-generation TKI for 44 months. He continued to take gefitinib without experiencing serious adverse events.


## CASE PRESENTATION

A 68-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension for 2 years, amlodipine-treated regularly, visited our hospital in June 2019 with a dry cough, right-sided chest pain, and mild dyspnea. An enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a 55 Â 120 mm mass in the right lung. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated a tumour that was 5 Â 12 cm in size in the right pulmonary lobe and multiple nodules in both lungs ( Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and bone scan did not show any signs of metastasis. A CTguided lung biopsy was performed, and adenocarcinoma was confirmed. Molecular analysis of the tumour using a realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed a complex of EGFR mutations, including an exon 18 mutation (G719X) and an exon 20 mutation (S768I). The patient was advised on the basis of the effectiveness and the cost of different generation TKI therapies, however, the patient chose to take gefitinib, first-generation, at a dose of 250 mg every day due to financial constraints. After 6 months of treatment, the patient's clinical symptoms improved, and he experienced a reduction in cough and chest pain, as well as a significant reduction in the size of the lung lesions on imaging ( Figure 1B). At the time of this article's writing, he is taking gefitinib at a daily dose of 250 mg, and his condition has remained stable for 44 months of treatment without experiencing adverse events of a greater than or equal to a severity grade of 2 ( Figure 1C).


## DISCUSSION

Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations are one of the most common oncogenic driver events in NSCLC. 1,2 Classical activating mutations (exon 19 deletions and the L858R point mutations) comprise many EGFR mutations and are well documented as having a significant association with the therapeutic response to EGFR TKIs. The EGFR TKIs bind to the ATP region on the tyrosine kinase, which results in the inhibition of persistent phosphorylation, the inhibition of intracellular transmission, and a reduction in proliferation, adhesion, invasion and metastasis, and an acceleration in the death process of the cell. However, lowfrequent mutations including point mutations, deletions, insertions and duplications occur in exons 18-25 of the EGFR gene in NSCLC and are associated with diminished response to EGFR TKIs. 3,4 Despite the existence of numerous highly specific methods for detecting rare EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients, the understanding of the molecular biology of those mutations is still limited. In clinical trials of advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, only 7%-23% of patients had uncommon EGFR mutations. 5 These mutations are composed of a variety of different mutations that are almost 600 in number. In a study by Kate et al, complex mutations in EGFR were observed in 53% of all patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (44 of 83 patients). 6 From literature research and our own experience, a complex of G719X and S768I mutations is extremely rare, constituting less than 0.3% (3 of 1260 patients) of all EGFRpositive non-small cell lung cancer, 6 and around 60 documented cases in the published literature since their first description by Lund-Iversen et al in 2012 7 (Table 1). In  these cases, a variety of tyrosine kinase inhibitors were employed in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer, however, there is no recommendation for which TKIs to use in the presence of complex G719X and S768I mutations due to the lack of data on the effectiveness of TKIs in these compound mutations. Osimertinib, the thirdgeneration TKI, was recommended for the treatment of EGFR-sensitive advanced NSCLC in a clinical trial that compared its benefits to those of first-generation TKIs. 5 However, clinical studies of the use of osimertinib for the treatment of NSCLC with compound mutations in this pathway are lacking. A study by Ramalingam et al (Aura study) only reported one patient with complex of G719X and S768I mutations who was treated with osimertinib at a dose of 80 mg/day, and the total duration osimertinib treatment was 5.6 months. 13 A multicentre, phase II study by Cho et al evaluated patients with uncommon mutations showed that progression-free survival (PFS) of two cases with complex of G719X and S768I mutations was not separately reported, however, patients with G719X and/or S768I mutations had a PFS of less than 13 months. 16 Indeed, Cai et al documented a lasting response to osimertinib that was longer than 31 months in G719X and S768I mutations in patients with lung cancer. 18 Contrasting these findings, a study by Zapata Laguado et al. reported a poor outcome of first-line osimertinib for a patient with lung cancer harbouring these compound mutations, the patient progressed after 4 months of treatment. 20 In comparison with the third-generation TKI, the clinical data regarding afatinib in treating NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations are more extensive. In the Lux-Lung series, patients with G719X and/or S768I had a median PFS of approximately 13-15 months. 21 Additionally, two studies that reported the use of afatinib in patients carrying these compound mutations demonstrated a response that lasted longer than a year (range, 12-17 months) at the time of publication, however, both patients experienced gastrointestinal toxicities and a dose reduction was reported in one patient due to toxicity. 15,17 In our study, we demonstrated a prolonged response to gefitinib, the first-generation TKI, in a patient with advanced NSCLC that harboured uncommon complex of G719X and S768I mutations, and no progression of disease has been documented so far in this patient for 44 months of treatment with a targeted agent. Although first-generation TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) were less effective in common EGFR mutations than second-and third-generations TKIs, 4,5 several case reports of patients using first-generation TKIs with compound of G719X and S768I mutations demonstrated promising results. A retrospective study by Chiu et al demonstrated a median PFS of 11.9 months in patients included G719X mutation in combination with either S768I or L861Q mutations. 8 A study by Svaton et al that used gefitinib reported a PFS of 8 months. 9 In addition, Lund-Iversen et al documented a successful response to gefitinib in a 70 year-old male patient at 14 months of treatment. 7 These findings were similar to the treatment of firstgeneration TKIs in common EGFR-positive NSCLC. 2 6 In conclusion, we here reported the successful response to gefitnib in the Vietnamese patient with advanced NSCLC carrying uncommon complex of G719X and S768I mutations. The response to first-generation TKIs was inconsistent from report to report in the literature. Additional research is necessary to assess the efficacy of first-generation TKIs in patients with advanced NSCLC that harbour uncommon EGFR mutations.
