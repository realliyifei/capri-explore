## INTRODUCTION

Bertolotti's syndrome is defined as a congenital lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) that is responsible for disabling low back pain. It most commonly occurs at the L5 level, followed by the L6 level, and is characterized by various morphologic presentations [ Table 1]. Several medical and surgical therapies are available to treat this syndrome: for example, physical therapy, corticosteroid injections (many risks/complications without documented long-term efficacy), laminectomy, spinal fusion, and removal of the pathologic bone segment. [2,10,14] Here, we demonstrate the outcomes after surgical resection of LTSV in two pediatric patients and have reviewed the relevant literature.

relief. Her neurological examination was normal. Lumbar X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed Bertolotti's syndrome, characterized by a right-sided partially sacralized L5 vertebra with pseudoarthrosis between L5 to S1 and ileum, with areas of irregularity/sclerosis [ Figure 1a and b]. She underwent resection through a posterior midline approach confirmed on the postoperative CT [ Figure 1c and d]. She was asymptomatic within 6 postoperative weeks and remains symptom-free 2 years later.


## Patient 2

A 16-year-old female presented with 2 years of low back pain and 3 months of pain radiating into her left hip refractory to NSAIDs and physical therapy. Comorbidities included recurrent migraines, major depressive disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome. Her neurological examination was normal. e lumbar CT and MRI studies showed Bertolotti's syndrome on the left at the L5-S1 level characterized by an enlarged left L5 transverse process fused with the ilium and sacrum, with mild degeneration/sclerosis of the left L5 pars interarticularis [ Figure 2a and b]. After surgical resection, confirmed on postoperative CT, she was intact and remained so 1 year postoperatively [ Figure 2c and d].


## DISCUSSION AND REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE Diagnosis and pathophysiology of Bertolotti's syndrome

Bertolotti's syndrome is found in 10% of patients presenting with back and leg pain under 30 years of age. [16] e biomechanics of LSTV is attributed to an alteration or reduction of movement between the transitional vertebra and the sacrum that can ultimately lead to pain from stress in the facet joint and/or is exacerbated by disc degeneration. [9] Table 1: Castellvi classification schema of Bertolotti's syndrome by laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral) and morphological characteristics (size and anatomy involved) of the abnormal vertebral articulation.


## Castellvi classification system for lumbosacral transitional vertebra


## Type

Characteristics Specification I Enlarged, dysplastic transverse process (>19 mm craniocaudal width) Ia: Unilateral Ib: Bilateral II Pseudoarticulation of the transverse process and sacrum with incomplete lumbarization/sacralization; enlargement of the transverse process w/pseudoarthrosis with a diarthrodial joint between itself and the sacrum IIa: Unilateral IIb: Bilateral III Transverse process completely fused with the sacrum with complete lumbarization/sacralization IIIa: Unilateral IIIb: Bilateral IV Type IIa pseudoarticulation on one side of vertebrae and Type IIIa fusion on the contralateral side 


## Radiographic analysis

Radiographs, including flexion, extension views, and oblique views, confirm the diagnosis of Bertolotti's syndrome. Both CT and MRI also demonstrate Bertolotti's syndrome and also readily identify associated stenosis, osteophytes, and sclerosis adjacent to the articulation between the lumbar segment and ilium and/or sacrum.


## Management of Bertolotti's syndrome

Surgical resection of LSTV should be considered in patients presenting with intractable low back pain despite conservative treatment (e.g., physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and localized anesthetic blocks in adults Figure 3). [7] Outcomes of surgery with Bertolotti's syndrome ere are few reports for patients under 18 years of age treated for Bertolotti's syndrome [ Table 2]. [5] In three pediatric studies, two 17 years old experienced relief of their back and leg pain at 6 months and 1 year after surgery; in another, a 13 years old reported no improvement at 6-month follow-up; in a third, an 18 years old (in the same study) reported total alleviation of back pain 2 years after surgery. [3,4,8] Likely, Bertolotti's syndrome is underdiagnosed in the pediatric population. Although surgical outcomes are generally positive, no randomized studies have documented their efficacy versus conservative nonsurgical treatment.


## CONCLUSION

Bertolotti's syndrome is seen in 10% of patients presenting with back and leg pain under 30 years of age. [16] While few surgical cases are reported in pediatric patients, removal of the abnormal transverse apophysis and disconnection from the lumbar spine/sacral ala should be considered as for those who fail conservative treatment.
