Electronics 2023, 12, 2676.Abstract: Biomedical signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) are recorded routinely to provide helpful information for early diagnosis of disease. Low power consumption is very important to allow long-term ambulatory monitoring with battery-powered systems. A direct digital conversion (DDC) technique has been proposed in recent years, which employs preamplifier and data converters, reducing the complexity of the readout chain and thus its power consumption. This paper provides a review on DDC for biopotential signals and bio-optical signal acquisition. The state-of-the-art DDC-based readout architectures together with circuit implementations are provided.

## Introduction

Home-based health monitoring through wearable devices is becoming prevalent. Low power consumption is very important to allow long-time monitoring. Besides power consumption, for multiple-channel applications such as neural recording, there are also requirements of a small size and minimum off-chip components.

There are mainly two categories of biomedical signals: biopotential signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG), and bio-optical signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Interestingly, they share a similar signal pattern, which is a small useful component superposed on a large quasi-DC component [1]. Traditional biopotential signal readouts consist of an AC-coupled preamplifier followed by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) [2]. To reliably achieve a sub-Hz high pass frequency, large off-chip components are needed. Meanwhile, DCcoupled structures have a limited gain, reducing the effective resolution on the useful AC signal at the ADC output. Traditional bio-optical signal readout circuits use an integrator or a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) to convert the photocurrent to a voltage that is then digitized by an ADC [3]. However, the architecture of using TIA is prone to noise folding. In addition, due to the low perfusion index (PI) of the chest PPG signal, a larger dynamic range (DR) is required for the readout circuit, which undoubtedly increases the complexity of the design and power consumption.

In recent years, a direct digital conversion (DDC) structure has been proposed to directly digitize biomedical signals, which overcomes the above problems by combining preamplifier and ADC into one stage while making compromises among area, noise, power, and input impedance, etc.

In Section 2, we describe the techniques for neural signal recording. In Section 3, the techniques for voltage-controlled oscillator-based signal recording are presented. In Section 4, we discuss the techniques for PPG/NIRS signal recording. In Section 5, we conclude with the focus of neural signal recording and PPG/NIRS signal recording.


## Techniques for Biopotential Signal Recording

Multi-electrode neural recordings are becoming standard practice in neuroscience research to gain knowledge on the way the brain works and enable neuro-prosthetic applications. There is a clear need for a higher number of recording sites per given area, which provides real-time signals at the level of neurons from an ever-increasing brain volume. In parallel with the requirements of signal integrity and low power consumption, a miniature IC chip area with the minimum number of off-chip component is of paramount importance to enable hundred-channel neural probes [4].

One of the main issues leading to a large chip area is the electrode DC offset originating from the electrode-electrolyte interface [5]. This offset can reach the levels of up to 100 mV depending on the type of material of the electrode and the surrounding tissue and fluids [5], which is higher than the actual neural signals, i.e., action potential (AP) around 1 mV and local field potential (LFPs) around 10 mV. While accepting this large DC offset would lead to a limited gain of frontend amplifier and very high resolution of ADC with high power, the common solution is to reject the DC component with a passive or active filter, as shown in Figure 1. The high pass corner frequency can be expressed as fHP = 1/2πRfbCfb. With the properly chosen Rfb and Cfb, the filter cut-off should be made under 1 Hz to capture the complete signal band of the LFPs while rejecting the DC signal. In terms of circuit design, this approach may be challenging because high product RfbCfb requires high values for one or both of the filter elements. Achieving both high capacitance capacitor and high resistance resistor values requires a large circuit area. Pseudo-resistors, as shown in Figure  2 (n is design parameter and UT is the thermal voltage), can be used with a small area, but it can exhibit an X0.1 to X10 variation over PVT and be sensitive to light exposure [6]. The direct digital conversion technique can provide DC rejection capability with an extremely small chip area. The high pass corner frequency can be expressed as f HP = 1/2πR fb C fb . With the properly chosen R fb and C fb , the filter cut-off should be made under 1 Hz to capture the complete signal band of the LFPs while rejecting the DC signal.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, the first DDC for biopotential signal readout was proposed by H. Kassiri et al. [7]. Figure 3a shows a conventional first-order ∆∑ ADC; this circuit has a tradeoff between integrated noise, oversampling rate (OSR), and power consumption. As a result, with an anticipatory design, it can satisfy a neural recording front-end requirement of bandwidth, noise, and power. However, any DC offset from the electrode can make the amplifier saturated. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the first DDC for biopotential signal readout was proposed by H. Kassiri et al. [7].

However, any DC offset from the electrode can make the amplifier saturated. In order to improve the suppression of the electrode DC offset (EDO) while maintaining a high chain gain, the so-called ∆ 2 ∑structure added an additional ∆ stage to the ∆∑modulator as shown in Figure 3b. As a result, the difference of two consequent input signals is fed into the DDC, which removes the DC component, avoiding integrator saturation. The output of the quantizer is thus the derivative of the input signal, and it can be integrated into the digital domain to reconstruct the AC component of the original signal. In the feedback path, the DAC and integrator is implemented by a digital controlled charge pump. Although this structure enables EDO rejection in a rail-to-rail range, integration using IDAC results in an insufficient ability to track fast transients due to the large time constant of the integrator. Moreover, a DT ∆ 2 ∑ADC needs a high OSR to avoid KT/C noise aliasing at the cost of limited input impedance. As a result, the differential-mode signal caused by different high impedances of the microelectrode attenuates the ability of immunizing large artifacts. Figure 4 shows an op-amp-less ∆-modulator diagram using a continuous-time ∆-ADC [8] to achieve the shaping the spectra of neural signals such as LFPs and ECoG, which can decrease the DR requirement of recording front end by more than 30 dB.

Meanwhile, this structure achieves above GΩ input impedance because it uses the DC-coupled front end without input capacitors. However, without noise shaping, low-frequency noise of the system is high, so that SNDR is limited.

A second-order hybrid continuous time to discrete time (CT-DT) ∆∑-∑modulator [9] was presented as shown in Figure 5. The structure adds a ∑ stage to a conventional twoorder ∆∑-modulator, thus achieving three-stage noise shaping and one-stage input signal shaping.

However, the input impedance of this work is still relatively low (26 MΩ).  Works [7,9,10] employed switched cap/chopping circuit at the input as shown in Figure 7a, which leads to a limited input impedance. Recently, Gm-C-based structures have been proposed to solve this problem. S. Wang exploited the current feedback gm stage [11] as the CT-integrator within a ∆ 2 ∑ architecture [12], which is shown in Figure 7b. The inherent high Z in of the gm stage together with the proposed bootstrapping increase the input impedance to 663 MΩ, which is shown in Figure 8. The EDO rejection of this work is, however, only ±70 mV. M. Sporer proposed a Gm-C-based second-order delta sigma modulator in [13] using bulk-driven DSL. The structure achieves a bandwidth of 10 kHz and an input impedance of 238 MΩ, while the EDO rejection range is only ±100 mV. A similar structure was proposed in [14]; however, its linearity is limited due to the open-loop Gm-C stage. Readout circuits in other fields [15,16] can also offer some ideas.

Table 1 summarizes the performance of state-of-the-art DDC-structured biopotential readout circuits. In [7], a DT ∆-∆∑ structure was implemented to eliminate the input DC offset, which achieved rail-to-rail offset tolerance. A high OSR (1000) is needed to reduce kT/C noise. Such high switch frequency with a capacitor leads to a limited input impedance (<100 MΩ). In [9], a hybrid CT-DT ∆∑-∑ modulator was used which achieves threestage noise shaping. The low-gain (gain = 8) stage needs large power consumption (15 µW) to reduce input-referred noise. The system linearity is limited by a five-bit quantizer and a five-bit CDAC.

This work has an above GΩ (2.94 GΩ) input impedance because there are no input capacitors. Without an op-amp, the system only occupies 0.044 mm 2 . However, without noise shaping, SNDR (60 dB) is limited. In [12], a current feedback gm stage was proposed as the CT-integrator within a ∆ 2 ∑ architecture. A second-order noise shaping (OSR = 512) was used to achieve low quantization noise. However, the flicker noise of current mirror was not chopped, so that the noise (2.88 µVrms) of the system was not low enough. In order to boost input impedance, this work implemented bootstrapping first gm stage, which limited EDO tolerance (70 mV). In [13], a Gm-C-based second-stage ∆∑-modulator was used with bulk-driven DSL. It achieved a 238 MΩ input impedance with low OSR (136) and small input capacitor (60 fF). In [14], a similar structure was used, achieving low noise (3.9 µVrms) with a 0.0046 mm 2 area. Overall, compared to the DT delta-sigma DDC structure, the CT (continuous-time) delta-sigma DDC structure is more favored in neural signal acquisition systems because it does not require a high oversampling ratio and hence avoids noise aliasing. If a large input range is the primary requirement of the system, the preferred approach is to use low gains and ∆∑-∑ structures [10]. When input impedance is of paramount importance, a system that does not use a large input capacitance becomes the primary choice [8,12]. When considering the number of acquisition channels limited by chip area, using the Gm-C structure without capacitors as an integrator has advantages, as demonstrated in [13,14].

## Techniques for Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)-Based Signal Recording

Although the CT-∆∑modulator achieves a high dynamic range, low noise and high input impedance at the same time, the supply voltage cannot be easily reduced to a sub-1V range because the output signal amplitude and thus the overall SNR/SNDR are always limited by the supply. This makes the front ends difficult to implement in a more advanced technology node together with the ever-complicated digital processing circuits, which benefit significantly from Moore's law. Frequency-domain separation is a workable approach to reduce supply and cancel artifacts [17].

Therefore, W. Jiang proposed a VCO-based neural signal recording system [18] in 2017 which is able to work at a 1.2 V supply while providing similar performance as that of the CT-∆∑ architecture. Instead of processing input signal in the voltage domain, it directly converts voltage into the frequency domain by using VCO. Due to the high voltage-to-frequency gain of VCO, the input signal can be applied directly to the VCO without preamplifier, as shown in Figure 9, achieving a high input range together with low noise. To maintain high SDNR of system, the VCO nonlinearity can be corrected by foreground correction. In this work, it is implemented by a fifth-order polynomial VCO tuning curve stored in the digital circuits. The VCO-based neural signal recording system achieves a ±50 mV input range and a 76 dB SNDR. Meanwhile, it occupies 0.135 mm 2 with an analog power of 3 µW and a digital switching power of 4 µW. The disadvantage of this loop architecture is that it may still limit the linearity of system because of PVT variations, even with a nonlinearity calibration effort.

To avoid this limitation of open-loop VCO-based system, a closed-loop CC-VCO-based sensor readout system featuring hybrid PLL-∆∑modulator is proposed in [19]. As shown in Figure 10, the dual VCOs integrate the input voltage to create phase variation, which is subsequently detected by phase frequency detector (PFD). The PFD acts as an integrator that generates the sum of input phase difference. Compared to classic PLL, this work uses an array of 15 PFDs instead of only one PFD as an efficient quantizer. The dual VCO structure allows the PFD to perform self-comparison without an extra phase. The PFD array can detect every delay stage of VCOs which naturally create a set of evenly phase-shifted PWM waveforms without a classic barrel-shifter.

In [19], a closed-loop VCO-based system is presented using a PFD array as quantizer. With a PFD array, the system avoids high-speed VCO to save power (4.5 µW) and area (0.025 mm 2 ). Therefore, the FoM of the system is higher than that in [18]; however, the input impedance is not considered. In [22], a Gm-C-based CT-DSM is proposed without chopping. This work has good performance on SNDR (80.4), area (0.078 mm 2 ) and input impedance (13.3 MΩ@10 kHz). However, without chopping, the CMRR (76 dB) and noise (95 nV/ √ hz) are poor. In [20], a VCO-based quantizer is proposed using DPCM to avoid nonlinearity. With low OSR (OSR = 32), the system achieves an SNDR of 89 dB, consuming 3.2 µW. Although other performance values are excellent, the input impedance (4 MΩ) is limited by the chopper and input capacitor. In [21], a third-order VCO-based DSM was proposed using a pseudo-virtual ground to eliminate the large swing at the integrator output. This work also achieves good tradeoff between SNDR (92 dB) and power (4.4 µW), but input impedance is poor. Compared to the traditional DDC structure, the VCO-based DDC structure can achieve higher SNDR and FOM more easily because it has larger input range and displays lesser quantizer power consumption. The linearity of closed-loop structures is better [19][20][21][22] compared to the open-loop VCO-based structures in [18]. An obvious advantage of higherorder VCO-based DDC [21] is their ability to achieve large input range and high SNDR. When input impedance is the primary requirement, chopper-less designs [18,22] exhibit excellent performance at the cost of low-frequency noise. When considering the area of the acquisition chip, the hybrid PLL DSM structure proposed in [19] is suitable due to its low VCO center frequency.


## Techniques for Bio-Optical Signal Recording

Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are optical sensing modes that not only provide heart rate as conventional ECG, but also enable calculation of blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ). PPG obtains the pulsating changes in the volume of blood vessels along with the pulsation of the heart by recording the light absorption of the measured part in real time. Similar to biopotential signal recording systems, biooptical recording systems should also feature low power, low noise and small chip area to reduce costs. What is more, the PPG signal consists of an AC component and a DC component, and the ratio of AC/DC can be as low as 0.1%; therefore, another challenge of the PPG sensor readout system is to achieve a high DR [25,26]. A conventional PPG readout circuits includes a TIA, an anti-aliasing filter, a sample/hold circuit and an ADC. The ADC quantization noise and nonlinearity can limit the PPG sensor DR [27][28][29][30]. Therefore, DDC techniques play an important role in minimizing the power, noise and chip area while providing a high DR [31,32].

In terms of a low-power PPG system, reducing the power of LED drivers is significant. The system feedbacks the PPG output to the LED driver to control the driving current dynamically in [33]. As shown in Figure 14, a TIA followed with a nine-bit ADC is used to convert the PPG input current to a digital signal. Dynamic Range Enhancement (DRE) is implemented, which includes a digital filter to obtain the DC components of the PPG signal. This DC component is feedbacked to subtract the static photocurrents, so the accuracy requirement for Aa is relaxed. Moreover, the digital output value can dynamically adjust the LED driving current to ensure that the driving current is in a reasonable state. In this way, the system achieves a 87 dB time-varying interference attenuation with a 425 µW power consumption. However, the dynamic range is limited by DRE.

Compressive sampling is another technique to save LED driving currents [34]. As shown in Figure 15, the signal is sampled at a sub-Nyquist frequency and adjacent samples are uneven in time distribution. Hence, the LED driving current is proportionally reduced.

The HBLL receives the PPGCLK signals and estimates the heartbeat interval (HBI) by using a counter.

Integrating the PD on the chip can save area and simplify the system architecture while offering good tradeoffs of power and noise. An integrated monolithic PPG sensor with on-chip pinned photodiodes (PPD) is proposed [36]. PPD is commonly used in CMOS image sensors (CIS) due to their high sensitivity. Therefore, this work achieves the same signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio compared to that of the conventional architecture at a significantly lower power. As shown in Figure 17, averaging is applied to reduce the read noise and relax DR requirements.

Architecture of the monolithic PPG sensor. Table 3 summarizes the power consumption of state-of-the-art PPG readout circuits. It is worth noticing that various technologies have been implemented to rapidly reduce the LED power and AFE power of a PPG system, even at the cost of area. As illustrated before, accurate recording of PPG signals requires high DR of the readout system. The majority of the PPG signal is the DC component; therefore, the main ADC power is used to quantify DC currents. A workable solution is the use of a DC servo loop to subtract the DC components before the input signals enter TIA. F. Marefat proposed a new light-todigital convertor (LDC) which allows the measurements of DC and ambient components of the PD current for signal cancellation [31]. As shown in Figure 18a, two eight-bit IDACs are implemented to compensate the ambient light, as well as DC components, which are recorded for further processing as well. PDACs serve as main-feedback DAC of LDC, and nDACs replicating pDACs relax the current-drive requirements of the amplifier. This topology can achieve a 92.7 dB DR while consuming 8.1 µW power. Based on this concept, a second-order ∆∑ LDC is applied for benefiting from two-stage noise shaping [37]. As shown in Figure 18b, two 10-bit DACs instead of 8-bit DACs are employed to cancellate the ambient light and DC components. Multiple DACs are implemented to complete the closed loop while ensuring linearity. However, the second-order architecture benefits from lower noise, but also consumes higher amounts of power. In this work, a 108.2 dB DR is achieved while using a 15.7 µW AFE power. Since oversampling is necessary for noise shaping, a higher pulse frequency is required with higher LED power.  Q. Lin proposed a reconfigurable LDC for PPG sensor readout in [38] which utilizes a current integration and a charge counting to reduce noise contribution.

Finally, this work achieves a 119 dB DR with a 196 µW power consumption. Dual-slope ADC is an excellent solution for the required high DR of PPG monitoring. Further, this architecture is also suitable for low-bandwidth and linearity requirements. To reduce AFE power consumption caused by dual-slope ADC long-time conversion, a hybrid-architecture-slope LDC is proposed [39]. With noise shaping, the hybrid architecture quantizer can be lower to achieve the same resolution as that of the pure dual-slope quantizer. As shown in Figure 20, a 10-bit quantizer is used to convert the integrator output to a digital code. An on-chip digital threshold filter controls a seven-bit IDAC to compensate the DC components of PPG signals. This work achieves a 134 dB DR while consuming 28 µW of power.

In a bio-optical signal recording system, the LED power consumption is the main contributor to the system power consumption compared to AFE. Compared to using a one-bit quantizer LDC [31,37] structure, using slope-based LDC [38] and dual-slopebased LDC [39] can greatly reduce LED power consumption by low LED pulse frequency. Furthermore, compared to [38], although the dual-slope-based LDC has a higher rate of AFE power consumption, it has higher DR while consuming less LED power.


## Conclusions

This paper describes an overview of biomedical signal readout circuits. In the ECG monitoring domain, a direct digital conversion technique has been proposed in recent years, which employs preamplifier and data converters, reducing the complexity of the readout chain and thus its power consumption. To be suitable for low power supply and process node, VCO-based architecture is proposed. However, all methods have poor performance in input impedance. Boosting input impedance is still a significant highlight of the biomedical sensor. For bio-optical monitoring, low power consumption and high DR are the main challenges. Determining a way to provide a good tradeoff between DR, AFE power and LED power is the focus of PPG design in the future.
