a b s t r a c tOligosaccharides are low molecular weight carbohydrates between monosaccharides and polysaccharides, which consist of 2 to 20 monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds. They have the effects of promoting growth, regulating immunity, improving the structure of intestinal flora, and are antiinflammatory and antioxidant. With the comprehensive implementation of the antibiotic prohibition policy in China, oligosaccharides as new green feed additive have been paid more attention. Oligosaccharides can be divided into the following 2 categories according to their digestive characteristics: one is easy to be absorbed by the intestine, called common oligosaccharides, such as sucrose and maltose oligosaccharide; the other is difficult to be absorbed by the intestine and has special physiological functions, called functional oligosaccharides. The common functional oligosaccharides include mannan oligosaccharides (MOS), fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), chitosan oligosaccharides (COS), xylooligosaccharides (XOS) and so on. In this paper, we review the types and sources of functional oligosaccharides, their application in pig nutrition, and the factors limiting their efficacy in recent years. This review provides the theoretical basis for further research of functional oligosaccharides, and the future application of alternative antibiotics in pig industry.

## Introduction

Antibiotics have antibacterial, antiviral, and growth-promoting effects. Since the 1940s, antibiotics have been widely used in livestock and poultry production. Their effects of medical treatment, health care, and growth promotion have had a very beneficial impact on the development of animal husbandry (Yin et al., 2021;Murugaiyan et al., 2022). With the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for meat products increases greatly, which also prompts abuse antibiotics in the breeding process, resulting in antibiotic residues, and causing great harm to human health Yang et al., 2019; Lalou ckov a and Sk rivanov a, 2019). With the progress of science and technology and the improvement of people's safety awareness, the damage of antibiotics to human beings has become increasingly apparent. There are more and more calls to ban antibiotics. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued Notice 194 prohibiting the addition of antibiotics to feed from January 2020. Therefore, the development and utilization of new green residue-free feed additives have been paid more and more attention, and implementing a comprehensive antibiotic prohibition policy has been implemented.

Oligosaccharides are low molecular polymer composed of 2 to 20 monosaccharide groups connected by the same or different glycosidic bonds, which can be categorized into common oligosaccharides and functional oligosaccharides according to the action mode of oligosaccharides. After entering the gastrointestinal tract, oligosaccharides are digested and absorbed, and thus used as energy sources by the body such as sucrose and maltose (Rajagopalan and Krishnan, 2019;Vieira et al., 2020). Functional oligosaccharides have not only the characteristics of common oligosaccharides, but also a variety of biological functions, which can be used as feed additives to promote the growth and health status of livestock and poultry. Therefore, in recent years, the domestic pig breeding industry has been hit hard by the double blow of African swine fever and COVID-19, how to improve the immunity of pigs and reduce the disease rate has become a top priority. Functional oligosaccharides can effectively reduce intestinal pH value, promote mineral absorption, improve animal feed conversion efficiency, maintain intestinal microflora structural homeostasis, improve body immunity, and have the characteristics of green residue-free (Pan et al., 2018). Many animal experiments have shown that functional oligosaccharides have good effects on pigs, poultry and ruminants, which can improve animal performance, reduce feed to meat ratio, improve disease resistance and intestinal health, and thus reduce mortality, so they are regarded as an adequate substitute for antibiotics (Xu et al., 2019;Tiwari et al., 2020).

Functional oligosaccharides are sugars formed by corresponding monosaccharides linked by a-1,6, a-1,3, and a-1,2 glycoside bonds.

However, the front part of the digestive tract of monogastric animals can only produce enzymes digesting a-1,4 glycoside bonds.

Therefore, functional oligosaccharides are not easily degraded by intestinal digestive enzymes, but directly enter hindgut where many microorganisms live. Beneficial microorganisms can produce enzymes that decompose various glycosidic bonds. Functional oligosaccharides are decomposed and utilized here and converted into small molecules such as short-chain fatty acids to promote the proliferation of beneficial bacteria and inhibit harmful microorganisms ( Fig. 1). Common functional oligosaccharides include xylooligosaccharides (XOS), mannan oligosaccharides (MOS), chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). With the increase of antibiotic prohibition, the development, utilization, and mechanism of new green additives such as functional oligosaccharides are particularly significant. In this paper, we will review the types and sources of functional oligosaccharides, their application in pig nutrition, and the factors limiting their efficacy in recent years. This review will provide the theoretical basis for further research of functional oligosaccharides, and the future application of alternative antibiotics in pig industry.


## Types and sources of functional oligosaccharides

Functional oligosaccharides mainly include FOS, MOS, XOS and COS (Patel et al., 2011). Because functional oligosaccharides have physical and chemical characteristics such as low calorific value, stability, safety and non-toxicity, high viscosity, strong hygroscopicity and not being digested by gastrointestinal tract, and also improve the intestinal microflora, reduce serum cholesterol and neutral fat, improve blood sugar, improve the feed efficiency, improve animal immunity, thus it has attracted the attention of the more and more scholars (Pan et al., 2018). The following mainly introduces the related characteristics and sources of FOS, MOS, XOS and COS.


### Fructo-oligosaccharides

The molecular formula of FOS, also known as fructo-oligose, glucose-trisaccharide, is GFn (n 4, G for glucose, F for fructose). It is a general term for a group of oligosaccharides formed by binding several D-fructose on the basis of sucrose molecules through b-1,2 glycosidic bonds (Rastall et al., 2010;Rahim et al., 2021). Solid fructo-oligosaccharides are white powdery, easily soluble in water, low in sweetness that only 0.3 to 0.6 of sucrose, and low in energy, which also the only functional oligosaccharide with the dual physiological characteristics of super bifidogenic factors and water-soluble dietary fiber, which widely exists in bananas, potatoes, wheat, barley, onion, garlic, and other plants. Among them, the content of Jerusalem artichoke tuber is the most abundant (Yıldız, 2010;Micciche et al., 2018). It is difficult to extract natural FOS. Commercial production methods of FOS are generally divided into 2 categories, one is the sucrose enzymatic method, and the other is the extraction method (Cano et al., 2020). Relevant studies have shown that FOS can promote the abundance of many beneficial bacteria in the intestinal tract of livestock and poultry, inhibit the growth and reproduction of harmful bacteria, and improve the digestion and absorption of nutrients, and consequently to improve the microecological environment, and improve their immunity and production performance in livestock and poultry.


### Mannan oligosaccharides

In general, MOS consists of mannose-molecules or mannoseglucose, which is formed by a-1,2, a-1,3, a-1,6 glycosidic bonds.

Glucose is a phosphorylated glucomannan protein complex extracted by enzymolysis from mannosan-rich yeast cell walls Fig. 1. The beneficial effects of functional oligosaccharides on the intestinal health of weaned piglets through interaction with intestinal microbes. Functional oligosaccharides are broken down by specific enzymes secreted by beneficial bacteria in the gut to produce short-chain fatty acids that maintain intestinal health. SCFAs ¼ short-chain fatty acids. N. Liu, H. Shen, F. Zhang et al. Animal Nutrition 13 (2023) 206e215 (Faustino et al., 2021). They widely exist in guar bean gum, sesbania gum, konjac powder, and yeast microbial cell walls, MOS from different sources have different chemical structures. For example, konjac MOS with a molecular ratio of 1:1.6 are synthesized by polymerization of glucose and mannose residues through b-1,4 glycosidic bonds, and its side chain is connected by b-1,3 glycosidic bonds, which has the characteristics of gel (Sohn et al., 2000;Wang et al., 2018). The main chain of oligosaccharides derived from yeast cell wall is mainly arranged by highly branched pyranose residues.

The main chain is secured by a-1,6 glycosylases, and the side chain is connected by a-1,2 and a-1,3 bonds. They main composition is a mixture of disaccharide, trisaccharide, and tetrasaccharide, which have the following characteristics: (1) soluble in water, but insoluble in ethanol, acetone and ether and other organic solvents;

(2) high temperature resistance, high temperature conditions will not damage its structure and physiological function; (3) easy to absorb moisture, but after moisture absorption does not affect its use value. Commercial MOS are mainly extracted by enzymolysis and then put into production. At present, MOS for feeding mainly come from konjac powder enzymolysis products and yeast cell wall extracts (Yui et al., 1992). In pig breeding, MOS have critical protective effects on the intestinal health and immune performance of pigs. Related studies have shown that mannan oligosaccharides have dual effects of absorbing intestinal pathogens and immune regulation in piglets (Saeed et al., 2017).


### Xylo-oligosaccharides

Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) are functional oligosaccharides formed by combining of 2 to 10 xyloses by b-1,4 glycosidic bonds.

The main components of xylo-oligosaccharides are xylose, xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylan with a small amount of xylotriose or more, the main effective components are xylobiose and xylotriose (M€ akel€ ainen et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2018). Solid XOS are light yellow or light brown powder with high heat and acid resistance and good stability, and the effect of reducing water activity. In addition, compared with other oligosaccharides, the viscosity of XOS is lower, and the processing is more convenient. The primary sources of XOS are corn cob, straw, rice bran, wheat bran, rice husk, cottonseed shell, and other agricultural wastes. These raw materials are rich in xylan hemicellulose (up to 30%) and which also have wide range of sources and low prices. Therefore, reasonable development and application can increase the added value of agricultural and sideline products and reduce the cost of breeding (Carvalho et al., 2013). There are 3 main methods for extracting and preparing XOS: high-temperature cooking, acid extraction, and chemical-enzyme linked method. Chemical-enzyme-linked method is the most popular preparation method in China (Bhatia et al., 2019). XOS contribute to the formation of dominant beneficial flora in the intestinal tract of animals, thus inhibiting the adhesion of harmful bacteria in the intestinal tract, and positively improving the microflora and immune functions of the gastrointestinal tract of animals. Meanwhile, XOS also have specific impact on promoting the digestion and utilization of nutrients in livestock and poultry, thus improving their growth performance and antioxidant capacity (Gobinath et al., 2010;Yang et al., 2015).


### Chitosan oligosaccharides

COS are oligosaccharides linked by b-1,4 glycosidic bonds, and the numbers of glucosamine are usually 2 to 10. As the only natural cationic basic polysaccharide discovered at present, COS are generally less than 3,000 U in molecular weight and have good water solubility, partly soluble in methanol but insoluble in ethanol. Meanwhile, COS have excellent function and high biological activity, and their metabolites are non-toxic and antigenfree, which can be easily absorbed by the body. COS are not easily decomposed in the animal gastrointestinal tract and are absorbed directly by intestinal cells into blood circulation after entering the intestinal tract. The primary source is abundant marine biological resources, such as shrimp shells and crab shells. Then the oligosaccharides with the required degree of polymerization less than 20 were obtained by enzymic degradation (Singla and Chawla, 2001). COS have many physiological functions including antioxidant, regulating intestinal microecological environment, and improving body immunity. They also have the physiological functions such as anti-bacterial, anti-tumor, and improving animal growth performance etc., and consequently have been widely used in livestock, poultry production, and biomedicine (Ma et al., 2011;Swiatkiewicz et al., 2015).


## The application of functional oligosaccharides in pig breeding


### Growth performance

Functional oligosaccharides directly enter the intestinal tract of animals in the undegraded form, which can improve the absorption and utilization rate of nutrients in the intestinal tract and promote the overall growth performance of animals (Qiang et al., 2009). Some studies have shown that functional oligosaccharides can improve the intestinal health of pigs during pig breeding, improve feed intake, daily weight gain, and feed conversion rate of pigs, and reduce the diarrhea rate of piglets to a certain extent (Zou et al., 2016;Schokker et al., 2018). Different types of oligosaccharides can promote the growth performance of pigs in the breeding process to a certain time (Table 1). At the same time, the same type of oligosaccharides also has different effects on the growing development and health status of pigs at different growth stages. Diets supplemented with 0.1% FOS increased average daily gain and average daily feed intake, as well as dry matter and nitrogen digestibility of growing pigs from d 0 to 56 of the trial period (Lim et al., 2022). Some studies have found that the average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and weight gain/feed consumption of weaned piglets were significantly improved by adding 100 and 200 mg/kg COS and 80 mg/kg aureomycin in the diet, respectively. Meanwhile, the apparent digestibility of DM, Ca and P was also significantly improved in these 3 groups . The same conclusion was reached in other experiment, with the increase of dietary COS level, the improvement of average daily gain, average daily feed intake and apparent digestible energy of DM and N increased linearly (Chen et al., 2009). These results indicate that adding a certain amount of COS in the diet can replace antibiotics to improve the growth performance of piglets to a certain extent. For sows, studies have shown that functional oligosaccharides can also reduce their feed to milk ratio to a certain extent (Cheng et al., 2015).


### Immune function

The immune system is the primary weapon of the body to defend against the invasion of pathogens and remove foreign bodies and foreign pathogenic microorganisms. As an immune enhancer, functional oligosaccharides can combine with the surface of some viruses, toxins, and bacteria to improve body's immune function. Functional oligosaccharides can improve B lymphocyte mediated humoral immunity and T lymphocyte mediated cellular immunity, improve mucosal immunity of animals, and thus increase the immune function of animals, which have been used as immune adjuvant in livestock and poultry production (Dawood et al., 2018;Ashaolu et al., 2020). Serum biochemical index can reflect the animal metabolism in the body and help the livestock and poultry farmers detection and diagnosis of livestock and poultry diseases, further improve the animal growth performance . Therefore, serum biochemical levels including immune capacity and antioxidant capacity of livestock and poultry were measured as indicators to measure animal health status, so as to reflect the effect of functional oligosaccharides on immune function. Functional oligosaccharides can prevent and treat diseases by stimulating intestinal immune cells and increasing the production of immunoglobulin after ingested by pigs (Choque-Delgado et al., 2011). After antibiotics are forbidden, diarrhea caused by weaning stress of piglets becomes more and more serious, so it is urgent to find a new antibiotic substitute without residue. Therefore, the main research focus of functional oligosaccharides on immune function is their effect on the immunity of weaned piglets (Table 2). When 30 mg/kg or 500 mg/kg COS is added to the diets of weaned piglets, it can be used as an immunomodulator to increase the serum cytokines levels such as IgA, IgM and IgG (Duan et al., 2020;Xu et al., 2018). IgA, IgM, and IgG are antibodies to specific intestinal immune reactions of piglets, which can prevent pathogenic bacteria and other harmful substances from entering the body and act as a barrier. In addition, the increase of immunoglobulin and interleukin content in serum can also promote the development of immune organs. Shao et al. (2000) also showed that MOS could significantly increase the level of IgG and IgA in the serum of suckling piglets, but it had no significant effect on the content of IgM. Meanwhile, the related research shows that short-chain fructooligosaccharides can improve the secretion of cytokines in sows and enhance the immune response of IgA in serum and intestinal tract. In addition, it can improve the immune barrier function of sows to promote maternal health and maintain the normal growth and development of fetuses. Short-chain fructooligosaccharides can further enhance the immune response of intestinal mucosal cells of weaned piglets by increasing the number of cecal goblet cells (Le Bourgot et al., 2017).


### Antioxidant effect

Under certain conditions, the redox balance of the body is disrupted, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production rate exceeds the clearance rate of antioxidant system in the body, which leads to a large accumulation of oxygen free radicals known as "oxidative stress". It has a dual role, on the one hand which can inhibit microbial infection; on the other hand, if oxidative stress continues, it may lead to the occurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases, and then lead to metabolic disorders and physiological disorders, which adversely affect the growth performance, life span and quality of animal products, and bring huge economic losses to farmers and harm the health of consumers (Fig. 2). Timely regulatory measures can stop losses in time (Lauridsen et al., 2019). Antibiotic therapy is still one of the main treatment methods for animal inflammatory diseases, but the development of antibiotic substitutes is particularly critical in the era of antimicrobial prohibition. Functional oligosaccharides can alleviate oxidative stress by reducing the production of ROS and lipid metabolite malondialdehyde (MDA), and also can improve the body's antioxidant capacity by promoting the body's production of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, functional oligosaccharides can be added to livestock and poultry feed as an antioxidant to relieve oxidative stress, reduce the occurrence of inflammation and maintain body health (Table 2). There have been increasing reports on oligosaccharides as antioxidants to maintain health in recent years (Vieira et al., 2020). Adding 1% FOS to the diet of weaned piglets can increase the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in serum, and reduce the content of MDA in serum, which can relieve the oxidative stress of weaned piglets (Zhang et al., 2022). The same conclusion was also obtained when 2.5 g/kg FOS was added to the diet of piglets challenged with Escherichia coli (E. coli), confirming that FOS can increase the levels of GSH-Px and catalase (CAT) in plasma and intestinal mucosa of piglets (Luo et al., 2021). The antioxidant capacity and placental amino acid transport capacity of pregnant sows were improved by adding 30 mg/kg COS in the diet, and the activity of GSH-Px in offspring piglets was also increased. Meanwhile, the mRNA expressions of SOD and GSH-Px in colon of piglets were detected to increase. Therefore, functional oligosaccharides can have a series of beneficial effects on the health of sows and the growth and development of their offspring, promote the intestinal development of piglets, and improve the intestinal antioxidant performance, which can be used as a reference by farmers (Xie et al., 2016a(Xie et al., , 2016b. Different types of oligosaccharides can improve the antioxidant properties of pigs at different stages, which strongly proves that functional oligosaccharides have excellent antioxidant properties and can be used as an "antioxidant" in the future pig breeding process.


### Intestinal health

As a critical part of nutrition and nutrient absorption of livestock and poultry, intestinal health is very essential for livestock growth and disease resistance. Maintaining intestinal health is the key to realizing healthy livestock breeding. Among them, the meaning of "intestinal health" is multi-level, maintaining the integrity of the mucosal layer of the body to play a normal immune function, and includes stable intestinal flora structure and suitable intestinal environment (Jha et al., 2019). Functional oligosaccharides can promote animal intestinal development, improve the intestinal morphology and barrier function, and can be fermented to produce short-chain fatty acids of certain bacteria in the intestine. Thus, forming the intestinal acidic environment, providing a suitable living environment for bacteria, acidic environment is conducive to the intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, which can be beneficial to maintain health, intestinal tract to improve their immunity, ensure the follow-up healthy growth of animals and reduce breeding risks  (Cheng et al., 2017). Different types of functional oligosaccharides have certain effects on the intestinal health of pigs at different stages, mainly in promoting the proliferation of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus, as well as inhibiting the proliferation of E. coli. Moreover, the application effects of different types of functional oligosaccharides in animals are not consistent. When they are put into use, it is necessary to analyze the structural characteristics and specific conditions of livestock and poultry to select the appropriate type to achieve the best effect (Table 3). Supplementation of 200 mg/kg COS in the diets of weaned piglets infected with E. coli can increase the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, decrease the relative abundance of E. coli, and increase the villus height of ileum and jejunum, which is beneficial to the digestion and absorption of nutrients and intestinal health of weaned piglets (Liu et al., 2010). The relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Turicibacter in intestinal contents of weaned piglets was decreased when 100 mg/kg XOS were added in diets . Therefore, the application of different oligosaccharides in animal intestinal health should be further studied, and the mechanism underlying needs to be continuously explored to ensure the stabilizing effect of oligosaccharides in livestock and poultry breeding.


## Influencing factors

The key to pig farming is to improve the growth performance and immune performance, thereby reducing the incidence of disease. The prohibition of antibiotics and the frequent occurrence of African swine fever at home and abroad have caused more attention to the research and application of new feed additives. In recent years, many studies have been reported on the application of functional oligosaccharides in pig breeding, especially in weaned piglets. It plays a significant role in promoting animal growth, improving feed utilization efficiency, and reducing diseases. However, relevant reports have found that adding functional oligosaccharides into the diet of pigs has no significant effect, indicating that the effect of oligosaccharide feed additives is related to many factors, such as animal breeding environment, animal species and age, as well as the supplemental level of oligosaccharide in feed.


### Animal feeding environment

The effect of functional oligosaccharides on healthy pigs is not very significant. MOS can significantly increase the contents of IgA, IgG, and IgM in serum of germ-free piglets, but in normal healthy piglets, it can only increase the level of IgA, and has no significant effect on the contents of the other 2 immunoglobulins. Only when the intestinal factors have a great influence on the production performance, the growth-promoting effect can be clearly shown (Spring et al., 2015). In addition, only when animals are in a poor feeding environment, the feed hygiene cannot be well guaranteed, resulting in intestinal health and immune system impact, functional oligosaccharides can play a significant antibacterial and immune function, to play a role in regulating intestinal health. In general farms, piglets with 0.3% FOS increased their body weight by 13%, but only 4% in farms with more stringent sanitary conditions (Nakamura et al., 1988). Jeon et al. (2000) found that COS produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan has bacteriostatic effect. Only 0.5% concentration can completely inhibit the growth of E. coli, which can well protect the intestinal health of livestock and poultry.


### Physiological stage

The structure and function of the digestive tract are different in different physiological stages of animals. Functional oligosaccharides generally play a significant role in weaned piglets and diseased piglets. For growing-finishing pig, which have strong immune system and better health status, so adding oligosaccharide to their diets will not show much beneficial effects. Weaned piglets with developing immune system and unstable intestinal microflora are easier to get sick that the main reason of diarrhea is the increase of pathogenic bacteria, so adding functional oligosaccharides after weaning can achieve a better effect. Studies have shown that piglets grow slowly at 1 to 2 wk before and after weaning, and adding mannan oligosaccharides to the diet of weaned piglets improves the growth performance more significantly than pigs at the growth stage (Miguel et al., 2004).  added 200 mg/kg XOS to the diet of weaned piglets. They found that the intestinal microflora structure of piglets was improved, and the relative abundance of Lactobacillus increased, and E. coli decreased. When the same dose of XOS were added to the diets of growing pigs, the intestinal microbiota structure of pigs was not significantly changed (Sutton et al., 2021). Therefore, when selecting functional oligosaccharides as feed additives, the physiological stage of the feeding target should be considered first to better play the role of functional oligosaccharides and achieve the expected results of the feeding target. 


### Types and dosage of functional oligosaccharides

With a complex structure, widely spread source, and different production process, the functional oligosaccharides produced by different types and manufacturers have significantly different effects. For example, MOS play a role in feeding mainly by absorbing harmful bacteria and toxins and stimulating the immune system of animals. Still, there are relatively few studies on the effects of other oligosaccharides on the immune system. Besides the effect of the type of functional oligosaccharide on pig breeding, the dosage of additives also has a specific effect. When the same functional oligosaccharides were added to the same animal diets, the results varied depending on the amount added. The insufficient number of functional oligosaccharides in the diet had no apparent effect. On the contrary, if the dosage is too large, it will increase feed and feeding cost, and fail to increase beneficial bacteria, reduce harmful bacteria, and cause animal diarrhea. Therefore, the effective concentration of functional oligosaccharides should be fully considered if they are applied in the diets.


### Inherent levels of oligosaccharides in diets

The feed materials are rich in oligosaccharides, while the content of oligosaccharides in corn is very low. Still, the non-digestible sugars such as raffinose and stachyose are rich in barley, wheat, and soybean (Karr-Lilienthal et al., 2005), so the oligosaccharides in barley, wheat and soybean may affect the experimental results of dietary functional oligosaccharides.


## Application prospects


### Application of functional oligosaccharides in weaned piglets

As a new kind of green feed additive, functional oligosaccharides can improve the nutrients digestibility in the diet for weaned piglets, reduce the ratio of feed to meat, improve the antioxidant capacity of weaned piglets, improve the intestinal microflora structure, reduce the diarrhea rate, and relieve weaning stress. Dietary supplementation of 400 to 600 mg/kg COS can improve the growth rate of weaned piglets, enhance intestinal defense capacity, increase the number of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and reduce the number of Staphylococcus aureus in cecum (Yang et al., 2012). Adding 500 mg/kg XOS to the diet of weaned piglets can increase the average daily gain and feed utilization rate of piglets, and improve the serum antioxidant capacity, which is beneficial to the growth performance and survival rate of piglets (Chen et al., 2022). Davis et al. (2000) found that adding MOS can significantly improve piglets' performance (feed intake, daily gain, and feed conversion rate). Functional oligosaccharides improve the growth performance of piglets and have certain effects on the intestinal microflora of piglets. Supplementation of 0.5 g/kg COS can increase the number of beneficial bacteria and the concentration of short chain fatty acids in the ileum and colon of piglets, and reduce the number of harmful bacteria, which has a regulatory effect on the intestinal microbiota structure of piglets (Kong et al., 2014). Supplementation of 4 g/kg short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides in the diet of piglets with intestinal dysfunction can reduce the expression of malondialdehyde and proinflammatory factors in the jejunum and can restore the number of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract to the normal level (Yan et al., 2020). At the same time, relevant reports have shown that 2% FOS can increase the average daily gain and the number of Bifidobacterium in the ileum of weaned piglets (Shim et al., 2005).


### Application of functional oligosaccharides in sows

The gestation period of sows is a particularly vulnerable physiological stage, and corresponding measures should be taken according to its physiological characteristics to avoid adverse effects before and after delivery, such as insufficient milk production, frequent disease, and other phenomena. This period affects the health of piglets after birth and affects the reproductive cycle of sows. Dietary functional oligosaccharides can improve intestinal microflora structure, feed intake and nutrient digestion and absorption, antioxidant capacity and non-specific immunity. Meanwhile, dietary functional oligosaccharides can encourage better average daily gain, litter weight and healthy litter rate of postpartum weaned piglets (Fig. 3). Duan et al. (2019) added 400 mg/kg MOS in diets of sows and 800 mg/kg MOS in diets of piglets. They found that the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in jejunum of sows and piglets increased, while the relative abundance of E. coli decreased, and the secret immune globulin (SIgA) content in jejunum mucosa of piglets found an increase. In the piglets, they found that the mRNA expression levels of IL-8 and Toll-Like receptor ligand (TLRL) were decreased, and the contents of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-2, IL-4 and interferon (IFN)-g in serum of piglets were Fig. 3. Effects of functional oligosaccharides on the health of sows. Dietary functional oligosaccharides can improve the intestinal microbiota structure of sows, improve the feed intake and nutrient digestion and absorption, so as to improve the antioxidant capacity and non-specific immunity of sows, and further promote the body health of weaned piglets. N. Liu, H. Shen, F. Zhang et al. Animal Nutrition 13 (2023) 206e215 decreased, while the content of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was increased, which proved that MOS can improve the intestinal flora structure and immunity of sows and piglets, and it also can inhibit the occurrence of intestinal inflammation and improve the survival rate and growth performance of piglets. Cheng et al. (2015) fed 40 mg/kg COS to sows during oestrus increasing litter size of sows by 18.5% and piglet survival by 19.2%. After feeding 30 mg/kg COS to sows in late gestation and lactation, the amino acid content in milk secreted by sows increased, and the daily gain and weaning weight of offspring increased. At the same time, the blood sugar level and liver glycogen content of piglets are reduced, which further improves the growth efficiency of piglets (Xie et al., 2015). In addition, relevant studies have proved that obesity in sows during late gestation will aggravate perinatal metabolic disorders and affect offspring piglets' performance and intestinal health. Feeding gilts 1000 mg/kg of COS can reduce their final body weight and avoid excessive obesity (Egan et al., 2015). The effects of functional oligosaccharides on alleviating sow obesity and improving offspring survival were further verified. Supplementation of 100 mg/kg COS in the diet of sows increased serum leptin and immunoglobulin content at 35 and 85 d of gestation, and increased fetal survival rate, number of live piglets per litter and average body weight (Wan et al., 2016).


## Conclusion

In recent years, functional oligosaccharides have attracted more and more attention under the background of antibiotic resistance. There are many functional oligosaccharides, such as COS, XOS, MOS, FOS, etc. They come from a wide range of sources and are green and pollution-free, a good substitute for antibiotics. The physiological functions of functional oligosaccharides and their mechanism of action in pig breeding have also been further recognized. Functional oligosaccharides have certain positive effects on growth performance, immunity, and intestinal health of pigs, but there are still many factors affecting the function of functional oligosaccharides, and how to find a stable role for the use of functional oligosaccharides as feed additives remains to be further explored. All in all, future research should pay more attention to the relevant factors affecting the function of functional oligosaccharides, and study how to eliminate the adverse effects better, to use functional oligosaccharides with maximum efficiency, provide beneficial help for the development of pig breeding industry and provide a reference for the development and utilization of available functional oligosaccharides.
