a b s t r a c tBackground: Traditional knowledge (TK) is the culture as well as the identity of the majority of the ethnic communities. This knowledge is diminishing with time and with the advancement of synthetic medicines. The medicinal plants are equally effective with fewer side effects when compared to allopathic treatments for humans as well as livestock.Objective: The main focus of this study is to document the use of plants for the treatment of human ailments by traditional healers in the Barpeta district of Assam. Materials and methods: A survey was conducted to gather information on phytomedicines from among the 30 local practitioners or traditional healers in the Barpeta district of Assam state through face-to-face interviews and discussions. The data obtained from the study was compiled through the UR (Use report). The data was analyzed by F ic (informant consensus factor) and RFC (relative frequency of citation). The botanical name of the plants was verified using https://wfoplantlist.org/plant-list. Results: A total of 50 plant species having medicinal benefits belonging to 48 genera and 30 families were recorded. The leaves were the most used parts used in treatment accounting for 74% of the total and were usually used by extracting the juice. Besides, the most common disease treated using herbal medicines includes that of the GIT (gastrointestinal tract). The GIT disease category showed the highest F ic index which is 0.25. The plant species Syzygium cumini showed the highest RFC index of 0.50. Conclusions: The common people of the Barpeta district of Assam are found to be familiar with the practice of traditional medicines. This knowledge has mostly been passed down to generations from their ancestors who acquired it through trial and error methods. These medicinal plants are used in crude form. Therefore, the plants must be thoroughly analyzed and tested to identify the active principles involved in their mechanism of action which can be used in drug development.

## Introduction

All the districts including Barpeta under the state of Assam are crowded with an enormous diversity of flora. It encompasses a total area of 2243.96 sq. km having Bajali District in the east, Bongaigaon & Chirang in the west, Baksa to the north, and Goalpara & Kamrup District to the south of its border.

The application of plants as a healing source in Chinese writings and Egyptian papyrus was identified by the Ancient Unani manuscripts. Multiple research has presented evidence of the use of plants as medicines by Indian Vaidyas, Unani Hakims, and the Mediterranean and European cultures for over 4000 years [1e4]. The use of different plants by various ethnic communities or people in remote areas through TK for curing various diseases is very profound [5,6]. There are still thousands of people who are dependent on nature for food, fuel, medicines, and other livelihoods [7e10]. Herbal medicines are becoming more popular nowadays due to their efficacy and fewer side effects. The drug formulation prepared from herbs tends to have been found to have very less adverse effects when compared to allopathic medicines [11,12]. Multiple research has shown the importance of TK of medicines for the discovery of novel drugs. With gradual decrease in the efficacy of synthetic medicine and the development of resistance by pathogens against the particular medicine makes it necessary to discover novel drugs [13e15]. TK of medicinal plants against different ailments serves as a promising tool for the discovery of highly effective medicines [16].

Some of the common species having medicinal values include Eugenia jambolana [17], Holarrhena antidysentrica, Terminalia bellerica [18], Asparagus racemosus [19], Leucas aspera, Rubus moluccanus, Acmella calva and Houttuynia cordata [20], Curcuma longa, Aloe vera [21] Strobilanthes cusia [22], Centella asiatica, Zingiber officinalis [23], Terminalia chebula, Sphagneticola calendulacea, Saraca indica, Piper longum, Hydnocarpus kurzii [24], Saccharum officinarum, Aegle marmelos (Bhattacharyya et al., 2020), Emblica officinalis and many more [25]. The main objective of the present investigation is to highlight the traditional knowledge of the local people in connection with medicinal plants and to list out different ailments against which those plants are being used.


## Methodology


### Survey design

The survey was based on a cross-sectional study. An extensive field survey was conducted in different regions of the Barpeta district of Assam, India in 2021 and 2022. The respondent in our surveys mainly involved elderly people and local healers knowing the traditional use of the plants. The information on medicinal plants was obtained through face-to-face interviews consisting of semi-structured questions with the respondent at their residence. Before beginning each interview, prior informed consent was taken verbally from the respondents.


### Sampling

Our study is mainly based on subjective sampling methods which focuses on certain people in the communities knowing the plant use against a wide variety of illnesses. The knowledge was mainly passed on from their ancestors who in turn acquired them through trial and error methods.


### Sample size

A total of 677 villages are included in our study area, however, it is not possible to sample every village. Therefore, certain villages are chosen at random based on prior information. Using the random sampling method, we interacted with a total of 200 people in the study area out of which only 30 were found to have TK concerning the plants used for therapeutic purposes. They were considered as the 30 key respondents due to their rich indigenous knowledge on the therapeutic application of plants.


### Data processing


#### Data collection tool

The interviews especially focussed on the experiences of the local healers, plant species, and the specific parts being used (whole plant, roots, shoots, leaves, and flowers) to treat the particular disease, method of preparation of herbal medication, mode of use (oral consumption or external application in the form of juice, paste, or direct use) and dosage. The data gathered from the informants were then used to collect plants for voucher specimens [26].


#### Data repositories

The pressed and preserved specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of the PG Department of Botany, M.C. College (Gauhati University), Barpeta, Assam.


#### Data analysis tools

F ic (informant consensus factor): The information obtained from the survey was compiled through the UR (Use report) in Table 1. The data was analyzed by F ic (informant consensus factor) which helped in determining the homogeneity of the TK obtained from the informant about the use of specific plants. It was calculated using the formula:
F ic ¼ (N ur -N t )/(N ur -1)
Where N ur is the number of use reports in each disease category and N t is the number of taxa used in each disease category. The value of F ic ranges from 0 to 1 wherein if the value approaches 1 then it indicates a high degree of consensus among the informants [27,28].

RFC (relative frequency of citation): The relative significance of the medicinal plants was estimated by RFC (relative frequency of citation) whose value lies in the range of 0e1. This value indicates the importance of each plant species among the local healer. RFC is calculated by the following formula:


## RFC]FC/N

Where, FC is the frequency of citation i.e., how many informants have mentioned a specific plant and N is the total number of informants. If the value of RFC approaches 0 then it means very less informants mentioned the species. When the value tends to 1 then it indicates that most of the informants have mentioned the particular species [29].


#### Data access

The scientific names of the identified plant specimens are verified by the online database The World Flora Online (http:// www.theplantlist.org/).


### Methodological limitation

The study might have some coverage bias as certain segments of the population are excluded. The population from the urban or semi-urban areas was not included in our study as they are mainly dependent on the synthetic healthcare system. Their preference for traditional medicine is very low. They seldom seek traditional healers for the treatment of minor or severe ailments and their familiarity with the indigenous medicine system is negligible.


## Results


### Socio-demographic characteristics

The total population of Barpeta district as per the 2011 Census is 14, 39, 806 (consititing of 7,38,684 males and 7,01,122 females) according to Barpeta District Administration. Out of the 30 traditional healers interviewed, only a few of the healers in our study were females. The old adults and elderly respondents in their sixties and above were maximum as compared to the middle-aged adults. The traditional use of plants was very uncommon among young adults. Some of the respondents were literate but most of them were illiterate. The main occupation was farming and some small business and females were mainly housewives. 


### Taxonomy identification

TK refers to the understanding and skills of ancient culturebased practices that are different from modern synthetic knowledge [30]. TK can be of many types referring to the knowledge of people associated with resource use and management. These people are mainly those who stay in close association with nature such as the tribal communities. With time, they have developed practices that can be beneficial to them and in turn, sustain nature and natural resources. One of the TKs of these communities is the use of plants and plant parts for the treatment of a wide array of diseases and disorders [31]. The plant species documented in the current study are the result of the TK of plants of the local communities in the Barpeta District.

In the present study, 50 species of medicinal plants belong to 48 genera and 30 families have been reported. The most notable families were Fabaceae with 5 species followed by Malvaceae, Zingiberaceae, Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, and Myrtaceae having 4 plant species each. Two species have been reported each from the families Urticaceae and Araliaceae. The remaining 22 families including Amaranthaceae, Rutaceae, Apocynaceae, Rubiaceae, etc. have been recorded with one species each as shown in Table 1.


### Most commonly used plant parts

The study shows the utilization of leaves, roots, bark, fruits, seeds, stems, flowers, rhizomes, and sometimes the whole plant by traditional healers. A thorough investigation concluded that leaves account for 74% followed by whole plants for 10% and flowers for 6%. The utilization of seeds, bark, roots, and rhizomes is only 2%, each. Only 1% of rhizomes and 1% stems are used for ethnomedicinal purposes.


### Mode of preparation and administration

The healers adopted different means to administer the phytomedicines. The most widely adopted formulation included the preparation of juice obtained by crushing the leaves or plant parts and extracting out the juice, followed by paste, decoction, and oils. About 58% of the reported plant species are used by extracting juice  from leaves, flowers, or the whole plant, followed by 24% as paste, 16% as decoction, and 4% as chewed raw.


### Analysis of usage based on the treatment of different diseases

The plants as well as the specific diseases cured using them were compiled randomly. We focused on the knowledge of the healers about different types of diseases they can treat using plants rather than starting with a specific list of diseases. The final table was prepared solely on the information obtained during the survey. The total number of user reports recorded for different diseases/conditions is 75. It has been found that most plants were administered for treating diseases associated with GIT (gastrointestinal tract) followed by conditions associated with the integumentary system (dermatological diseases). The remaining plants were used against physical injuries such as cuts and wounds, disorders of the reproductive tract, metabolic disorders such as diabetes, ENT (ear, nose, and throat) diseases, and so on as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1.


### F ic (informant consensus factor)

The F ic for the disease under the category GIT is highest having a value of 0.25 followed by dermatological and reproductive disorders having a value of 0.20 each. The remaining disease categories have the least value of F ic . A high value of F ic indicates that comparatively fewer species are used by a large number of the traditional healers for disorders of GIT, dermatological and reproductive disorders. On the other hand, the low F ic value for the rest shows that the healers disagree on the species to be used in the treatment within a category of disease.


### RFC (relative frequency of citation)

The total number of informants i.e. N in our study was 30. The highest RFC i.e. 0.50 was found for the Syzygium cumini followed by A. vera and Achyranthes aspera with a value of 0.47. This indicates that most of traditional healers consider these species useful as healing herbs. Some species such as Alpinia galanga, Benincasa hispida, Cynadon dactylon, and many others as shown in Table 3 showed the least RFC value i.e. 0.03. This suggests the disagreement of traditional healers on the use of a particular plant species for its medicinal properties. The remaining species along with their RFC values are shown in Table 3.


## Discussion

The results obtained from the current exploratory survey show a total of 50 medicinal plant species. The study reported medicinal plants belonging to 30 different families and 48 genera being used by traditional healers in the different regions of the Barpeta district. The highest use has been found in the families of Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Malvaceae. Other important families are Zingiberaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae, Urticeae, and Araliaceae. The leaves were the most used parts for preparing the medicine formulation followed by whole plants. It depicts that the secondary metabolites active against the particular ailment are mainly present in leaves.

Most of the plant species have been documented by similar but extensive studies from Assam, India, and different countries outside India. The species such as Sida cordifolia, Sida rhombifolia [16] Drymaria cordata [18], C. longa, Clerodendrum colebrookianum, B. hispida, Ananas comosus, Ageratum conyzoides, A. marmelos [32], Hydrocotyle javanica, C. asiatica, C. dactylon, Cajanus cajan, Pouzolzia zeylanica, Saraca asoca [23], have been reported from Assam. Many important works across India have also mentioned the use of plants in traditional medicine systems including Dracaena angustifolia, Eclipta prostrata, S. cumini [33], A. aspera, Tinospora cordifolia, Mimosa pudica, Justicia adhatoda [21], Clitoria ternatea [34], A. vera, H. cordata, Mikania micrantha and Psidium guajava [35] are some of the internationally important reported plants that are documented in the present study.

The present study has reported some particular use of plants that have not been reported earlier by any other workers. These are Fragaria vesca for the treatment of impotency, Hellenia speciosa for piles, Persicaria orientalis for cracked heels, Oxalis corniculata in the prevention of nasal bleeding, Ocimum gratissimum for maintaining good hair health, Commelina benghalensis as remedy for insomnia, Boehmeria nivea for hair fall, and A. galanga in ear infection.

Many early studies have shown the active principles obtained from Ricinus communis to have the goitrogenic effect that can induce goitre formation [36]. However, during our survey, some respondents reported the use of R. communis in the treatment of goitre. The result may be due to the mode of formulation preparation or the additional ingredient (ginger extract) used along with it. Therefore, further investigation will be required to validate the use which if proven true can become a breakthrough in the treatment of goitre and other thyroid-associated disorders.


## Conclusion

The local practitioners/healers are the people who know the utilization of natural resources such as plants and sometimes animals for the treatment of different illnesses/conditions. The Barpeta district of Assam (India), being rich in biodiversity, is also the richest in terms of TK repository, where the traditionally knowledgeable people have inherited the knowledge system from their ancestors by trial and error methods, their skills, and innovations of using the plant as medicines. These methods are getting lost with time and advancement in modern medicine. Therefore, the conservation of these valuable TKs is the need of the hour.

The plants are given for the treatment of a particular illness in their crude form. However, not all the components are responsible for the healing properties, there are certain active principles or secondary metabolites that may be involved in the action. Therefore, the plants must be thoroughly analyzed, and tested to identify the active principles involved in their mechanism of action. The identification of the active principles can further help in drug development.
