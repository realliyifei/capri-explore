Methods: Design used in qualitative research with explanatory survey approach. The technique of sampling snowballs over the internet online, an anonymous online instrument was developed using google form. Questionnaire links were sent via email, WhatsApp, and other social networks through researchers. The instrument packaged in structured questioner form (included as an additional file) consists of questions covering several fields: (1) sociodemographic data (age, gender and level of education), (2) New normal behavior habits include wearing a mask, washing hands with soap or hand sanitizer, social distancing, Do not a crowd with many people, keep the environment around the residence always clean and healthy, packaged in google form.

## Introduction

The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing concern in the medical community, as it spreads globally. [1][2] The fact that people without symptoms is a potential source of infection justifies a thorough analysis of the dynamics of current outbreak transmission. 3 The virus is mainly transmitted by direct or indirect contact with the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose or mouth or hands. 4 Hygiene is considered an important step to prevent the transmission of pathogens in health care facilities, and it is proven that improving hand hygiene compliance significantly reduces infections acquired from health care. 5 Therefore, hand hygiene is recommended as an important strategy to help prevent the spread of Responses from respondents were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, with "Never"=1, "Almost never"=2, "Sometimes 3,"

"Almost always 4 and "Always" 


## Results and Discussion


COVID-19 in hospitals. possible spread of COVID-19. There is evidence that daily hygiene measures are an important part of infection prevention, which is important in the prevention of transmission and transmission. 6 There is evidence that daily hygiene measures are an important part of infection prevention and important in preventing transmission and transmission of infections. 4 Cross-rationing to others who live together, body hygiene habits, care control behaviors and disinfection in the environment. 7 Basic hygiene such as washing hands with soap and clean water is the most effective and economical way to prevent various infections of the digestive tract,digestion, and skin. 8 Coronavirus Disease 2019 

(COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by 

Severe 
Acute 
Respiratory 
Syndrome 

Coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2). 9 This pandemic 

has strengthened the need for changes in new 

normal behavior, namely 
frequent hand 

washing with hand sanitizer or with soap and 

running water, 
wearing masks, 
social 

distancing, avoiding crowds. The use of masks 

is very important to prevent pathogens from 

being inhaled and cause airway infections can 

result in low immunity and susceptible to the 

covid-19 virus. 10 Efforts made in improving 

personal hygiene are as follows; provide CTPS 

hygiene tools in public or home, bring hand 

sanitizer and wet wipes when out, use masks, 

cultivating new normal behavior. 11 The 

purpose of the study is to explore public 

knowledge about clean and healthy living 

behaviors after Covid 19. 

Methods 

The research design used in this study 

is qualitative with the explanatory survey 

approach that is attempt data collection is 

specifically designed to avoid contact person to 

person. The explanatory survey was conducted 

online, and only participants with Internet 

access were able to participate in the study. The 

sampling technique using snowball samples 

and online questioner was developed using 

Google 
forms 
with 
consent 
forms. 

Questionnaire links are sent via email, 

WhatsApp, and other social networks owned 

by researchers. Participants are encouraged to 

complete surveys covering sociodemographic 

(age, gender and education level), (2) daily 

behavior of family members that allows the 

transmission of covid 19 (hand washing with 

soap or hand sanitizer, change clothes after 

traveling, immediately bathe and clean 

yourself after from outside the house) with the 

format of the response carried out through the 

dichotomous question (yes =1/ not =0), (3) 

Personal hygiene habits are also supporting 

questions including; oral self-hygiene during a 

period of self-isolation (brushing 2 or more 

times per day, flossing once a day, gargling 

once a day, brushing the tongue once a day). 




To our knowledge, as we know, new normal behavior today has become a habit of everyday people in running a clean and healthy lifestyle. 12 However, in this study, it has not been able to see further the different effects of each member of the public in carrying out new normal behavior habits, because researchers have not made direct observations in the study subjects group. 13 The situation and conditions on the ground have not fully supported the data retrieval activities directly to respondents. hygiene and the environment around the residence. 19 The main thing in efforts to understanding to always run new normal behavior becomes a habit of living a clean and healthy life. 20 The main thing in efforts to The results also provide information that, effectively, clean and healthy living behaviors, hygiene at home and in daily life have the potential to reduce infection rates and antibiotic consumption, thereby reducing selective pressure for further development and spread of resistance 21 As noted in this new normal behavior effort to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus and slow the spread of COVID 19, hygiene practices including hand washing, are the first line of defense to reduce the transmission of infection and spread of the coronavirus. 22The study concluded that most of the study subjects had good knowledge of the spread, transmission and disconnection of the COVID-19 chain, but there were gaps in understanding new normal behavior. The following research is recommended to conduct a study on health belief models related to compliance with carrying out clean and healthy living behaviors.In 
this 
study, 
we 
explored 

sociodemographic, environmental hygiene 

around the place, healthy behavior habits 

including, wearing masks, hand washing, 

social distancing, availability of facilities for 

hand washing with hand sanitizer or hand 

washing with running water. 14 The results 

showed that the community has carried out new 

normal behavior with awareness without any 

compulsion from anywhere. Thus new normal 

behavior including, wearing masks, washing 

hands with running water or hand sanitizer and 

social distancing has become a new habit in 

order to break the chain of spread of 'covid 

19. 15 

Changes in thinking and changes in 

people's insights about the impact of this 

pandemic on hand hygiene prevent the spread 

of COVID-19, it is very important to comply 

with all measures of the Health protocol 

established by the government(RI, 2020) In 

addition, it will be interesting to know the 

different effects depending on the number of 

people in the household. Improper use of 

measures in indirect transmission of COVID-

19 between people living together. 16 

In descriptive sociodemographic data, 

the cleanliness of the environment around the 

place, healthy behavior habits include, wearing 

masks, hand washing, social distancing, the 

availability of facilities for hand washing with 

hand sanitizer or hand washing with running 

water. The results showed that the community 

has carried out new normal behavior with 

awareness without any compulsion from 

anywhere. Thus new normal behavior 

including, wearing masks, washing hands with 

running water or hand sanitizer and social 

distancing has become a new habit in order to 

break the chain of spread of 'covid 19. 17-18 

In the results of the study related to 

individual data respondents obtained result 

that highlights personal hygiene, considering 

sharing toothbrushes, toothpaste, the same 
container for brushes, closing the toilet lid 

before flushing and replacing the brush after 

the virus process can be a cross-contamination 

path COVID-19. 13 However, when studying 

oral hygiene habits, there is no significant 

difference so it is less able to provide 

information about personal hygiene. These 

results can be interpreted to show that personal 

hygiene 
exerts a considerable influence in 

breaking the chain of spread of COVID-19. 11 

Some respondents provided information 

related to factors that might 
contribute in 

efforts to break the chain of transmission and 

spread of covid'19 through 
increased 

knowledge and understanding of personal 

increase 
people's 
knowledge 
and 

increase 
people's 
knowledge 
and 

understanding to always run new normal 

behavior becomes a habit of living a clean and 

healthy life. 20
