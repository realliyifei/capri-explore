Ziegler-Graham et al.'s study on estimating the prevalence of limb loss in the United States from 2005 to 2050 highlights the growing need for innovative solutions in prosthetic device development [56].It is essential to understand the user satisfaction for long-term ULP prosthesis use, as highlighted by McFarland et al. [55]. Only then, and combining knowledge from biomechanics, materials science, and psychology can lead to a better understanding of user needs, which in turn may improve retention and satisfaction rates among ULP prosthesis users.

McFarland et al.'s study also highlights the importance of user satisfaction in longterm ULP prosthesis use. Combining knowledge from biomechanics, materials science, and psychology can lead to a better understanding of user needs, which in turn may improve retention and satisfaction rates among ULP prosthesis users [55].

Mass customization, demonstrated by Pallari, Dalgarno and Woodburn et al.'s work on foot orthoses [57], shows the potential of 3D printing in creating personalized prosthetics catered to individual needs. Developing customizable ULP sockets with tailored mechanical properties could significantly improve both fit and functionality for users.

Lastly, Biddiss and Chau's [42] research emphasizes the importance of understanding factors leading to ULP prosthesis abandonment. Interdisciplinary research combining insights from biomedical engineering, psychology, and social sciences can help identify barriers to continued use and devise strategies to increase long-term adoption and satisfaction rates.

The aforementioned examples serve to illustrate the considerable potential of interdisciplinary research in the design, fabrication, fitting, and maintenance of ULP, paving the way for the development of increasingly personalized, comfortable, and efficient prosthetic devices. Collaborative efforts encompassing a range of disciplines, such as biomechanics, materials science, psychology, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, have the capacity to yield remarkable advancements in ULP design, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals with limb loss.

Nevertheless, interdisciplinary research is not without its challenges, particularly with regard to effective communication and collaboration among researchers originating from disparate disciplinary backgrounds [3]. Each discipline possesses its own lexicon, concepts, and methodologies, which may impede efficacious communication and cooperation. Jeffrey [3] and Bruce et al. [8] posit that forging common ground and fostering mutual understanding among team members are essential for the success of interdisciplinary research. This might necessitate additional time and effort during the project's initial stages to establish effective communication channels and engender trust among researchers from various backgrounds. This study endeavours to explains the opportunities and challenges inherent in interdisciplinary research through an analysis of diverse cross-disciplinary studies.


### Challenges and Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Research

Interdisciplinary research has become increasingly important in recent years, offering significant opportunities for innovation by harnessing the knowledge and expertise of professionals from diverse fields [4,5]. Upper limb prosthetic socket design and manufacturing are areas where interdisciplinary research can play a crucial role, as they involve the integration of various fields such as engineering, materials science, biomechanics, and health care. By engaging in interdisciplinary research, researchers can develop innovative solutions that address the diverse needs of prosthetic users.

However, interdisciplinary research also presents several challenges, such as the need for effective communication and collaboration among researchers with different disciplinary backgrounds [3]. Each discipline has its language, concepts, and methodologies, which may hinder effective communication and collaboration. Both Jeffrey [3] and Bruce et al. [8] suggest that establishing common ground and shared understanding among team members are crucial for successful interdisciplinary research. It might require additional time and effort in the initial stages of the project to develop effective communication channels and foster trust among researchers from different backgrounds.

Feller, Ailes and Roessner [58] highlight the valuable contributions and potential impacts that research universities can make on technological innovation within various industries, including upper limb prosthetic design and manufacturing, through interdisciplinary collaborations in Engineering Research Centers (ERCs). Bozeman and Boardman [59] discuss the challenges that managing multipurpose and multidisciplinary university re-search centres entail, as institutional innovation is often required in order to accommodate collaborative work among researchers from diverse fields.

One opportunity in interdisciplinary research in upper limb prosthetic socket design is the potential for innovation in the field. By incorporating ideas and approaches from different disciplines, researchers can develop novel solutions to address the multifaceted problems associated with prosthetic socket design [58,59]. For example, the integration of advanced materials and engineering techniques can lead to the development of lightweight, comfortable, and durable prosthetic sockets that can withstand the stresses induced by the body's movements.

Furthermore, interdisciplinary research enables researchers to address the various user needs more effectively. Upper limb prosthetic users have unique needs and preferences, including comfort, aesthetics, functionality, and durability [6]. By engaging with health care professionals, researchers can better understand the users' needs and develop tailored solutions to meet those needs [60].

However, challenges in interdisciplinary research include the potential resistance to new ideas and approaches from traditional disciplinary frameworks [61]. Researchers may hold different epistemological and ontological beliefs, which can cause disagreements and hinder collaborative work [5]. To address this issue, researchers need to be open to diverse perspectives and engage in constructive dialogue that fosters integration and innovation [60].

Moreover, the evaluation of interdisciplinary research presents significant challenges. As Klein et al. [4] point out, interdisciplinary research often has variable goals and requires unique criteria and indicators to measure success. The current academic reward system may not fully recognize the contributions of interdisciplinary research, which can limit funding opportunities and career recognition [5,59]. Addressing these challenges and providing support for interdisciplinary researchers are essential for fostering innovation in the field.

In conclusion, interdisciplinary research in upper limb prosthetic socket design and manufacturing offers significant opportunities for the development of innovative solutions that address the multifaceted issues associated with prosthetic use. By embracing the unique perspectives and integrating diverse disciplines, researchers can design practical and effective prosthetic devices that meet users' varied needs. However, overcoming the communication, collaboration, resistance to change, and evaluation challenges associated with interdisciplinary research is crucial for successful implementation. With proper support and openness to diverse perspectives, interdisciplinary research can indeed pave the way for ground-breaking advances in upper limb prosthetic socket design and manufacturing.

However, to achieve this, researchers must engage in continuous dialogue to develop a shared understanding and respect for different disciplinary perspectives and approaches, integrate diverse methodologies and epistemologies, and promote institutional innovation that accommodates collaborative research efforts. Furthermore, the encouraging women enter into this science field, as suggested by Rhoten and Pfirman [5], and the consideration of contextual influences on transdisciplinary collaboration, as discussed by Stokols et al. [6], can enhance interdisciplinary research's effectiveness and productivity in upper limb prosthetic socket design and manufacturing. By addressing these challenges and capitalizing on the opportunities provided by interdisciplinary research, significant improvements can be made in the lives of individuals requiring upper limb prosthetic devices.

Embracing interdisciplinary collaboration has the potential to drive innovation by integrating different disciplines, such as engineering, materials science, biomechanics, health care, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. By addressing the diverse needs and preferences of prosthetic users and focusing on technology advancements, researchers and professionals can greatly enhance the quality of life for individuals requiring upper limb prosthetic devices [1,2].

However, interdisciplinary research also presents important challenges, mainly concerning effective communication and collaboration among researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds [3]. To overcome these challenges, researchers need to engage in continuous dialogue, develop shared understanding and respect for different disciplinary perspectives and approaches, and integrate diverse methodologies and epistemologies [8]. Promoting institutional innovation that accommodates collaborative research efforts is critical for the success of interdisciplinary research in upper limb prosthetic socket design and manufacturing [6,59].

Encouraging women to enter this field, as suggested by Rhoten and Pfirman [5], and considering contextual influences on transdisciplinary collaboration, as discussed by Stokols et al. [6], are essential steps that can enhance the effectiveness and productivity of interdisciplinary research in prosthetic socket design and manufacturing. This approach not only contributes to building a more inclusive and diverse pool of experts, but also fosters creativity and innovation in a field where user satisfaction is paramount [14,55].

Moreover, addressing the limitations and challenges associated with 3D printing, such as material properties, durability, quality control, and training requirements, is essential for the technology to reach its full potential in the development of upper limb prosthetic socket design and manufacturing [20,26]. Furthermore, the integration of emerging technologies such as AI and VR opens new research opportunities that can transform prosthetic device development and improve outcomes for users [7,54].

The potential of interdisciplinary research in upper limb prosthetic socket design and manufacturing can be realized when researchers, professionals, and institutions work together to embrace interdisciplinary collaboration, address the challenges it presents, and capitalize on the opportunities offered by this approach. By doing so, significant improvements can be made in the lives of individuals requiring upper limb prosthetic devices, ultimately contributing to their well-being and quality of life.

Through the examination of case studies, discussions around the advantages and drawbacks associated with interdisciplinary research, and consideration of user satisfaction and prosthetic usage, this paper provides an invaluable insight and direction for researchers and professionals seeking to contribute to this transformative field. In summary, addressing challenges and seizing opportunities provided by interdisciplinary research will be instrumental in fostering meaningful advancements in the lives of those who rely on upper limb prosthetic devices.
