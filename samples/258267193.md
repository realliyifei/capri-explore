This report highlights the feasibility of electrical cardioversion intervention for the treatment of heat stroke complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation. There has never been any mentions in the previous literature of the possibility of electrical cardioversion in the event of heat stroke complicated by rapid arrhythmia. A 61-year-old man with classic heat stroke complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation was admitted to our emergency department. In the early stages of treatment, hemodynamics were not stable under the treatments of aggressive cooling and volumeexpanding rehydration. It was considered to be related to rapid atrial fibrillation, and the administration of drug cardiover and control of ventricular rate failed. Subsequently, synchronous electrical cardioversion was given 3 times (biphasic wave, energy: 70J-80J-100J, respectively), successfully cardioversion and hemodynamically stable. Although the patient eventually died of progressive deterioration of multiple organ failure, timely cardioversion might be effective for the treatment of heat stroke complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation.

## Introduction

Heat stroke (HS) is the most severe type of heat illness, characterized by an increase in core body temperature of >40 • C, abnormal central nervous system function, and progressive multi-organ impairment [ [1,2]]. Cardiovascular disease is considered to be the first affected system in heat stroke [ [3]], and the clinical manifestations are mostly tachycardia and hypotension [ [4,5]]. However, it's inconclusive on whether electrical cardioversion is appropriate or not in the event of heat stroke complicated by rapid arrhythmia.

Here we report a case and review literature in this situation.


## Case report

A 61-year-old male with a 20-year medical history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency department (ED) with unconscious that had developed 60 minutes before. His sister was able to provide the history. She reported that he was given acupuncture point compressions and taken quick-acting Jiuxin pills by his family members at the scene of the attack, the patient physical cooling was not given. By the above disposal, he still should not be called. No diabetes, coronary heart disease, psychosis, liver and kidney dysfunction were provided. His first electrocardiogram in the ambulance displayed rapid atrial fibrillation (ventricular rate was 180 beats/minutes). Once at triage, the nurse immediately directed him to the resuscitation room.

On initial examination, he was in coma status and severe respiratory distress, and his Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 4. Review of vital signs revealed a systolic blood pressure was less than 90 mmHg and blood glucose was 7.8mmol/L. He had tachycardia to 200 beats/min (rapid atrial fibrillation), fingertip oxygen saturation of 92% and body temperature of 39.5 • C. His second electrocardiogram in the resuscitation room still displayed rapid atrial fibrillation which the ventricular rate was 205 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed pupils were the same size (2.5mm), extensive wheezing sounds were in both lungs, heart rhythm was absolutely irregular, bowel sounds were decreased, lateral Babinski sign and meningeal irritation were negative. No ventricular wall movement abnormalities, cardiac structural abnormalities, and adheal thrombosis were found according to cardiac ultrasound.

He was diagnosed as classic heat stroke according to the diagnostic criteria in expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of heat stroke in China [ [5]], concomitantly accompanied by rapid atrial fibrillation. He was rapidly treated with oxygen therapy, aggressive physical cooling and rapid rehydration of ice saline at 4 • C. His body temperature dropped to 38 • C and fingertip oxygen saturation rised to 97% through treatment within 20 minutes of his arrival，but the patient remained comatose and the systolic blood pressure continued to drop to 70-80 mmHg. Throughout the treatment period, ECG monitoring showed persistent rapid atrial fibrillation in patients, and the ventricular rate fluctuated around 200 beats per minute.

Considering the rapid atrial fibrillation leading to hemodynamic instability, we conducted drug cardioversion by amiodarone, ventricular rate control by sildiran and potassium supplementation by potassium chloride injection. However, the patient's heart rhythm did not improve, the blood pressure still showed a downward trend. After weighing the pros and cons， we performed the synchronous electrical cardioversion (a biphasic wave of 70 J), but we failed. Subsequently, two electrical cardioversions of 80 J and 100 J were given again. The patient's heart rhythm changed to supraventricular tachycardia which the rate fluctuated around 145 beats per minute, and his blood pressure rose to 110/65 mmHg.

In the follow-up rescue, we continued to treat according to the treatment principles of heat stroke, and the patient's heart rate was stable at 120-140 beats per minute. However, he had no improvement in consciousness, and his organ functions including breathing, blood clotting, heart, liver, and kidneys were demaged. He was treated with endotracheal intubation, ventilator-assisted ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), drug treatment including glucocorticoids, vasoactive medications, hemostatic drugs, human fibrinogen, prothrombin complex, Frozen plasma et al. Nevertheless, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and she finally died of the classic heat stroke.


## Discussion

As the global ambient temperature rised, the incidence of heat stroke increased year by year, and the case fatality rate remained high [ [6]], even under intensive care conditions, the case fatality rate was as high as 26.5％-63.2％[ [7,8]]. It seriously affected the lives, health and safety of the public. In this case, the patient was quickly and definitively diagnosed with classic heat stroke, accompanied by functional damage to 5 organ systems including nervous system (Loss of consciousness，GCS was 4), respiratory system (PaO 2 /FiO 2 was 100 mmHg), cardiovascular system (Pressure-Adjusted Heart Rate was 20.5 per minute), kidneys (Scr was 160.1 μmol/L) and blood system (PLT was 61 × 10 9 /L). According to the Marshall scoring standard, this patient had an overall MOD score of 13, and although active comprehensive treatment was given, he was ultimately not successfully rescued.

To date, there is a lack of literature and data support for standards for the treatment of heat stroke, and many comprehensive treatment options for heat stroke refer to the comprehensive management of cardiac arrest [ [9,10]], emphasizing timely, monitoring, comprehensive assessment and treatment. At the beginning of rescue, we considered that rapid atrial fibrillation aggravated hemodynamic instability and performed three consecutive electrical cardioversions after the failure of drug intervention, finally the patient's heart rate and blood pressure were temporarily stabilized. However, it is not known whether electrical cardioversion is appropriate or not in the event of heat stroke complicated by rapid arrhythmia. This intervention is not mentioned in the guidelines for the early management of patients with heat stroke published. To our knowledge, no similar case has been reported in the literature yet.

We reviewed the literature and found that tachyarrhythmias are more common in heart injury diseases caused by heat stress. Causes of this condition include: (1) heat stress causes degeneration and necrosis of cardiomyocytes to directly lead to increased excitability of myocardium [ [3]], (2) excessive secretion of norepinephrine and catecholamines [ [11]], (3) increased expression of cardiac-induced nitric oxide synthase [ [12]], and so on. In addition to the above factors, the patient in this case had hyperventilation and hypokalemia in the early stage of the disease, and the patient had fixed abnormal electrical conduction pathways because of atrial fibrillation, which can easily leaded to episodes of atrial fibrillation under heat stress.

However, tachyarrhythmias have a large impact on the development of heat stroke and the prognosis outcome. During the startup phase, rapid atrial fibrillation can lead cardiac blood output and blood flow through the surface of the body to decrease. Thereby, the body's ability to metabolize heat is weakened, resulting in an imbalance in the regulation of body temperature and triggering heat stroke. During the progression phase, the amount of circulating blood in the peripheral is insufficient, and the ability to carry oxygen is weakened, resulting in ischemia and hypoxia in various organs, which aggravates the process of organ damage. During the terminal phase, severe ischemia, hypoxia and hyperthermic toxicity of organs, greatly shorten the effective treatment time window for heat stroke, which is directly related to the final poor prognosis. Therefore, early active intervention is important when heat stroke is accompanied by rapid arrhythmias.

The clinical trial of rapid arrhythmias is mainly through drug intervention, and if the drug intervention is ineffective, synchronous electroborhelance therapy needs to be given for restoring sinus rhythm and improve patient cardiac function [ [13]]. Electrical cardioversion has a high level of safety and a low complication rate when strictly in accordance with routine operations，but the current can still cause damage to the heart muscle cells. Moreover, the incidence and severity of injury were positively correlated with the energy and number of electrical cardioversion [ [14,15]].

We believe that the occurrence and development of heat stroke in this case and the onset and persistence of rapid atrial fibrillation interact with each other and are mutually causal. Hemodynamics lose stability under the dual influence of dehydration and poor blood output from the heart, and the progression of multi-organ failure can be accelerated without active and rapid intervention. We consider that it is difficult to stabilize the hemodynamics of patients by giving aggressive cooling and rapid rehydration alone, termination of rapid atrial fibrillation should be placed in the same important position as the first two measures. We have successively given amiodarone and sidilan, but have not been able to terminate atrial fibrillation, which we believe may be related to the patient's poor blood volume, slow blood flow leading to a prolonged time of action of the drug peak, and decreased sensitivity of the heart to antiarrhythmia drugs in hypokalemia. Therefore, we carried out 3 electrical cardioversions urgently with increasing energy of 70-80-100J respectively, and the cardioversion was successful and the hemodynamics were stabilized. Immediately after electrical cardioversion, the re-examination of myocardial markers suggests that both Myo and CTNI are significantly higher than before, suggesting that myocardial injury is worse. We comprehensively analyzed the causes and concluded that the direct heart damage caused by high fever and myocardial ischemia and hypoxia was the mainstay, and the myocardial damage caused by electrical cardioversion was secondary. We assessed cardiac mechanical function and prognostic risk after cardioversion with the biomarker NT-Pro-BNP levels [ [16]] and echocardiographic parameters [ [17]] including left atrial indexed volume (LAVI), left atrial reservior strain (LARS) and left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), the results showed that NT-Pro-BNP levels (3110.12ng/L), E/e' ratio (15.1) and LAVI (39mL/m2) were increased, LARS (26%) and LVEF (47%) were decreased, indicating poor cardiac function and poor prognosis. Although the patient was aggressively treated, his multi-organ function impairment progressed rapidly, and eventually he died. However, evaluating the pros and cons, we believe that electrical cardioversion intervention is reasonable and feasible in the treatment of heat stroke with rapid arrhythmias, which can buy time for the rescue of subsequent heat stroke disease.


## Summary

This case provides some evidence for the use of electrical cardioversion in patients with a heat illness accompanied by rapid arrhythmia. Further research is required to assess the security of electrical cardioversion in patients with heat stroke.
