Dance movement therapy(DMT)is a physical and psychological intervention, but there was no meta-analysis of RCTs in the systematic review of DMT for dementia, and the results of RCTs were inconsistent. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of dance movement therapy on depression and anxiety of persons with dementia in comparison to no treatment, standard care. Six electronic databases (Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, EBSCO, CNKI) were searched through January 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Chinese and English language were considered, including: (1) population is women and men of all age with dementia and MCI; (2) intervention is dance movement intervention; (3) comparison is no treatment or standard care; (4) outcome is depression or anxiety. The four review authors independently reviewed studies on an abstract/title level and again after reading the full paper, and we independently evaluated methodological quality. Six randomized controlled trials were identified on depression and anxiety symptoms in persons with dementia. The target sample size was 29-842 older adults. Meta-analysis showed there were significant differences in favor of dance in depression (SMD = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.95, P = 0.003), but not in outcomes of anxiety. Trials of high methodological quality, large sample sizes, and clarity in the way the intervention is put together and delivered are needed to assess whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention on depression and anxiety for persons with dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 5th leading cause of death in the USA. With nearly 300 failed therapeutic trials to date,

## INVOLVING PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA IN SOCIAL RESEARCH: A LITERATURE REVIEW

Pamela Manley, 1 and Candace Kemp, 2 1. Georgia State University/Gerontology Institute, Atlanta,Georgia,United States,2. Gerontology Institute,Georgia State University,Atlanta,Georgia,United States Abstract Studies involving persons with dementia as research participants have increased over the years, due in part to an emphasis on patient and public involvement in health care and participatory action research. Recent studies indicate a growing trend toward engaging persons with dementia, not only as participants, but also as co-researchers. Further, studies involving persons with dementia as co-researchers and advisers have garnered increased attention due to the inclusion of this population's unique perspectives and lived experiences. Theoretically, frameworks such as person-centered-and relationship-centered care, also influence and shape the research process. This literature review examines empirical research conducted over the past decade that reports the involvement of persons with dementia as research participants ("research on") and co-researchers and advisers ("research with"). Among the 27 articles identified, 12 reported "research on," and 15 reported "research with" persons with dementia. "Research on" targeted participants' emotional expressions/responses, engagement in exercise/activities; social environment influences, and cognitive training; whereas "research with," which was mostly qualitative, focused on co-researchers' perspectives of and experiences with the research process; needs, priorities, and recommendations in research planning; partnering with persons with dementia on the design and development of research instruments, and the importance of critically evaluating the research process. Findings documenting research challenges, complexities, and ethical concerns are also discussed. Overall, findings demonstrate the feasibility of involving persons with dementia in a meaningful way and further affirms that including them as co-researchers is not only beneficial, but has the potential to enhance the entire research process.

Family caregivers of persons with dementia (PWDs) use social media to obtain and share health information. Yet relatively little is known about the types of information that these caregivers share. We address this gap by analyzing caregivers' posts (N = 401) in two subreddits, r/Alzheimers and r/ dementia, which represent two subgroups on the social media platform Reddit. Our research questions were as follows: (1) What are these caregivers' main purposes in posting? (2) What types of health information do the caregivers exchange online? (3) What are the characteristics of online posts that receive the caregivers' greatest attention? Content and correlational analyses revealed that over half of users (57%) posted regarding specific types of health information that they desired to seek and share, whereas the remaining users posted information for sharing only. The health information most commonly posted fell into the following three categories: psychosocial health information, information about patients' daily care, and characteristics of health conditions. The more health information types that a post contained, the greater the number of people who participated in the subreddit discussions. Further research should examine how social media meet PWD caregivers' needs for information support.

Critical wandering is common in persons living with dementia, it is defined as wandering that results in an individual going missing. This exposes the missing vulnerable older adult to risks and dangers. Persons with dementia who become lost and go missing and get lost can face adverse outcomes, such as injury and death, yet the amount of information available on the risk factors associated with these incidents is scarce. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with critical wandering in persons living with dementia. We used Tricco et al.'s (2018) approach for scoping reviews and searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Scopus. We included studies that referred to critical wandering in persons with dementia, cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer, and published since 1980. We identified 3,376 publications, which was reduced to 1641 publications after we removed duplications. A total of 78 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for analysis and extraction. A rigorous process to synthesize and categorize the research evidence was followed. We identified four different types of risk factors associated with going missing: (1) personal, (2) physical environment and geographical location, (3) cultural environment, and (4) social environment and support resources. Recognition of these risk factors can help persons living with dementia and their care partners identify interventions and proactive strategies to mitigate or prevent critical wandering. This will support persons with dementia, their care partners, and community organizations to balance safety, autonomy, and independence to maximize quality of life.


## STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTING MUSIC-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

Takashi Amano, 1 Joe Strong, 2 Cole Hooley, 3 and Megumi Inoue, 4 1. Rutgers University-Newark, Newark, New Jersey, United States, 2. University of Knoxville,Tennessee,United States,3. Brigham Young University,Provo,Utah,United States,4. George Mason University,Fairfax,Virginia,United States Previous research has found that music-based interventions are effective at improving several outcomes related to dementia for nursing home residents. Some studies have investigated the implementation of music-based interventions. However, to date, there is no synthesis available regarding strategies and outcomes of these implementation studies. This study aims to synthesize available evidence regarding implementation strategies and outcomes of music-based interventions for nursing home residents with dementia. We conducted a systematic literature search in PsychInfo, PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library. A total of 8 studies were included for the qualitative synthesis. Of the eight studies, half were studies of music therapy and the other half were on individualized music. We identified 49 implementation strategies. The most frequently reported category of strategies was planning (34.7%), followed by education (24.5%), quality management (24.5%), restructuring (12.2%), and finance (4.1%). No strategies under the category of attending to the policy context were reported. We identified 21 implementation outcomes. The most frequently reported category was adoption (33.3%), followed by fidelity (28.6%), appropriateness (19.0%), sustainability (9.5%), acceptability (4.8%), and cost (4.8%). No studies measured feasibility or penetration. Although various implementation strategies have been utilized, most of them are under the categories related to intervention methods. Less attention has been paid to strategies that aim at structural changes of intervention delivery systems. Future studies should investigate facilitators and barriers of implementing music-based interventions especially focusing on organizational and structural aspects.


## UNDERDIAGNOSIS OF DEMENTIA AMONG INDIGENOUS OLDER ADULTS WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT

Takashi Amano, 1 Carlos Andres Gallegos, 2 William Waters, 3 and Wilma Freire, 4 1. Rutgers Newark,New Jersey,United States,2. University of Vermont,Burlington,Vermont,United States,3. Universidad San Francisco de Quito,Quito,Pichincha,Ecuador,4. Universidad San Francisco de Quito,Universidad San Francisco de Quito,Pichincha,Ecuador Early and timely diagnosis of dementia has been recognized as key to improving health outcomes. However, underdiagnosis among the indigenous population has not been adequately investigated. This study examines the association between indigenous ethnic identity and receiving a diagnosis of dementia and identifies factors associated with receiving a diagnosis of dementia. Data were drawn from Ecuador's Survey of Health, Welfare and Aging (SABE) -2009, based on a probability sample of households in Ecuador with at least one person 60 years or older. This is a robust data set that allows for understanding ethnic dimensions and disparities, especially because of the successful recruitment of indigenous households. The final sample consisted of 1,437 people who had cognitive impairment. Whether participants had ever been told that he/she had dementia was compared between the groups of people who identified themselves either as indigenous or others. Binary logistic regression analysis was utilized. Indigenous participants had a lower probability than others of receiving a diagnosis of dementia after controlling for health and function related covariates. This association became statistically insignificant after including socioeconomic factors in the model. The final model revealed that people who had higher educational attainment were more likely to receive a diagnosis of dementia. Findings suggest that underdiagnosis among indigenous older adults can be explained by their lower socioeconomic status rather than by health and functional status. This finding implies the possibility of developing strategies to promote timely diagnosis by targeting populations who are especially susceptible to underdiagnosis of dementia.
