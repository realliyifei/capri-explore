Case Report
Background: Severe ankylosing spondylitis (AS) affects the entire spine, increasing the risk of vertebral fractures. ere are several fusion procedures used (e.g., anterior, posterior, or combined 360° procedures) to stabilize these fractures.Case Description:A 45-year-old male with a 33-year diagnosis of AS presented with a progressive quadriparesis of 6 months' duration. Previously, he had surgery on both hips. e medical report documented degenerative spondylolisthesis at the C5-C6 level along with syndesmophytes a herniated disc and stenosis. Following a circumferential decompression/fusion without complications, the patient's symptoms resolved.Conclusion:For patients presenting with cervical fractures and AS, circumferential surgical decompression/ fusion may result in good outcomes.

## INTRODUCTION

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) may present in patients under the age of 40 and is more prevalent in males (e.g., 80% under age 30). [7] Severe AS affects the entire spine, increasing the risk of vertebral fractures. However, there are few guidelines regarding the optimal management of cervical fractures attributed to AS.


## METHODS

We performed a literature review in PUBMED for AS. We included 13 AS articles involving a total of 221 patients.

Here, we also present a 45-year-old male who in 2019 presented with a C5-6 cervical fracture attributed to AS.


## CASE REPORT


## Case description

A 45-year-old male with a 33-year history of AS presented with a progressive quadriparesis (e.g., hypertonia, hyperreflexia positive bilateral Babinski and Hoffman signs, and neck disability index [NDI] of 10) of 6 months duration. e neurological findings included Grade IV quadriparesis, with hypertonia/hyperreflexia, and bilateral Hoffman's and Babinski signs. Previously, he had surgery on both hips for AS deformities.


## Radiologic findings

e preoperative medical report showed degenerative changes of the atlantoaxial joint, and at the C5-C6 level, degenerative spondylolisthesis, posterior syndesmophytes, thickening of ligamentum flavum, bilateral uncoarthroses, degenerative changes of the interapophyseal articulation, C5-C6 joint effusion, and disc dehydration/herniation and stenosis [ Figure 1a-c].


## Surgical procedure

e patient underwent a circumferential surgical procedure. e first operation included an anterior C5-C6 discectomy and fusion that utilized a cage containing iliac autograft; a plate was also applied. e secondary surgery involved a posterior approach (e.g., C5-C6 laminectomy with bilateral lateral mass screw placement).


## Postoperative course

Up to 2 years postoperatively, the patient remained asymptomatic (e.g., NDI of 0) with final fluoroscopic images confirming adequate C5-C6 circumferential fusion [Figures 2a and b, 3].


## DISCUSSION

We presented our case of AS and a review of 13 studies of cervical AS. ose cases are presented in [ Table 1]. e latter series involved 127 (57.2%) patients who were treated by posterior surgery alone, while 63 (28.3%) underwent combined anterior and posterior operations. Interestingly, 134 (60.3%) patients demonstrated unsatisfactory outcomes. is high failure rate was largely attributed to performing posterior fusions only.  Ma et al. [5] had certainly promoted performing 360° fusions for patients with cervical AS involving spinal cord injuries. Certainly, circumferential fusion utilized in our patient yielded an excellent outcome.


## CONCLUSION

e operative technique utilized to treat patient with cervical AS fractures should depend on the type/location of these fractures with the clinical findings. [1][2][3][4] However, most studies showed that a circumferential surgery for these cases correlates with the best outcomes. [6][7][8] Declaration of patient consent e authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent.
