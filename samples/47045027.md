IntroductionThere is considerable uncertainty about the reproducibility of the various instruments used to measure dyspnea, their ability to reflect changes in symptoms, whether they accurately reflect the patient's experience and if its evolution is similar between acute heart failure syndrome patients and nonacute heart failure syndrome patients. URGENT was a prospective multicenter trial designed to address these issues. Methods Patients were interviewed within 1 hour of first physician evaluation, in the emergency department or acute care setting, with dyspnea assessed by the patient using both a five-point Likert scale and a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) in the sitting (60º) and then supine (20º) position if dyspnea had not been considered severe or very severe by the sitting versus decubitus dyspnea measurement. Results Very good agreements were found between the five-point Likert and VAS at baseline (0.891, P <0.0001) and between changes (from baseline to hour 6) in the five-point Likert and in VAS (0.800, P <0.0001) in acute heart failure (AHF) patients. Lower agreements were found when changes from baseline to H6 measured by Likert or VAS were compared with the seven-point comparative Likert (0.512 and 0.500 respectively) in AHF patients. The worse the dyspnea at admission, the greater the amplitude of improvement in the first 6 hours; this relationship is stronger when dyspnea is measured with VAS (Spearman's rho coefficient = 0.672) than with the five-point Likert (0.272) (both P <0.0001) in AHF patients. By the five-point Likert, only nine patients (3% (1% to 5%)) reported an improvement in their dyspnea, 177 (51% (46% to 57%)) had no change, and 159 (46% (41% to 52%)) reported worse dyspnea supine compared with sitting up in AHF patients. The PDA test with VAS was markedly different between AHF and non-AHF patients. Conclusions Both clinical tools five-point Likert and VAS showed very good agreement at baseline and between changes from baseline to tests performed 6 hours later in AHF patients. The PDA test with VAS was markedly different between AHF and non-AHF patients. Dyspnea is improved within 6 hours in more than threequarters of the patients regardless of the tool used to measure the change in dyspnea. The greater the dyspnea at admission, the greater the amplitude of improvement in the first 6 hours.Introduction Endotracheal intubation (ETI) engages the patient's life and demands a good experience. A preliminary prospective study has shown in one hospital that emergency physicians (EPs) rarely performed ETI. Do the EPs in Ile de France (Paris region) have sufficient experience and regular training to realise this procedure safely in the emergency room (ER)? Methods We conducted a descriptive telephone-based questionnaire study to assess EPs' endotracheal intubation skills through all ERs in Ile de France public hospitals. A questionnaire was completed by the investigator during a 10-minute telephone call with at least one EP in each ER. The structure of hospitals, number of ETIs performed, devices and personnel available and the existence of protocols were collected. Their usual practice of sedation and intubation, training and proposals for changes were noted.ResultsThe study was made through all of the 64 public hospitals of Ile de France. Fifty-six hospitals have an ICU, 37 a mobile ICU. We questioned 96 EPs; that is, 10% of EPs from our region. All of the 96 EPs called responded. These physicians were certified emergency physicians (CAMU) for 90% of them. The median of ETI declared was 24.5/year per ER. Thirty-eight percent of EPs performed less than five ETIs during the past 2 years. The success rate reported was 85%. In 94% of ERs, metallic blades and Eischmann mandrin were available and about two nurses can help during the procedure. Predictive criteria for difficult ETI cited the most were: short neck, obesity, small mouth opening and otorhinolaryngology disease or previous history of cervical radiotherapy. Seventy-six percent of EPs followed the recommendations for preoxygenation and 91% performed rapid sequence induction. The vast majority (76%) of ERs did not have standardized procedures for airway management. Theoretical training was acquired for 46% of EPs by the CAMU, practical training occurring in the operating room for 71%. Among the EPs interviewed, 87% believe that they should remain the principal actor for ETI -although as high as 89% of them consider that they were insufficiently trained in ETI management and only 41% pursued continuing medical education on that theme. Seventyseven percent proposed to spend time in the operating room to improve their practice of ETI. Conclusions ETI is rarely performed in the ER. It should be part of the EP curricula and written procedures should be made.Introduction Incorrect positioning of the endotracheal tube (ETT) within the airway after emergent intubation can result in serious complications. Accidental mainstem bronchus intubation is associated with contralateral atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, hypotension, and decreased survival. Conversely, failure to place the tube several centimeters beyond the vocal cords may result in inadvertent extubation, aspiration, pneumonia, or laryngeal spasm [1]. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ETT malpositioning after emergency intubation in the out-of-hospital setting. Methods A retrospective study of a 5-year time period, using records of 1,081 patients admitted to the trauma emergency room (ER) at a university hospital. Within 30 minutes after admission, a chest X-ray or whole-body CT scan was routinely performed in intubated patients to determine the tube-tip-carina relationship. Results Sixteen out of 1,081 patients died immediately after admission to the trauma ER and were not further radiologically diagnosed. Of the surviving 1,065 patients, 346 (32.5%) were female and 719 (67.5%) male. In the group of 488 intubated patients, 346 (70.9%) were correctly intubated, 89 (18.2%) were not correctly intubated -herein were 64 patients (14.7%) intubated with tip-carina distance <2 cm, and 25 patients (5.7%) were endobronchially intubated. Chest X-ray scans were not available for 53 patients (10.9%). Detailed data on ETT placement were available in 435 patients; 346 (79.5%) with correct ETT placement, 89 (20.5%) with incorrect ETT placement. None of the patients displayed an esophageal or pharyngeal intubation (0%). Of 435 patients, 324 had been intubated preclinically on scene -254 (78.4%) were correctly intubated, 70 (21.6%) were not correctly intubated. Conclusions This study clearly shows that ETT misplacement in emergency patients is still a serious problem with an incidence of 21.6% in our study, of which 5.7% were endobronchially intubated. We conclude that the skill level of the operator may be key in determining efficacy of endotracheal intubation. Based on our findings, all efforts should be made to verify the tube position with immediate radiographic confirmation after admission to the ER.

For the synchronized film, the investigator wore a lead apron and dosimeter, stood 1 to 1.5 meters away from the patient, and pressed the inspiratory hold button. The sequence of the paired films was computer-randomized. The ventilator model, settings, patient position and portable X-ray machine settings were kept constant between films. Patients served as their own controls. Films were independently scored (1 = not clear/poorly inflated, 5 = very clear/well inflated) by two specialist radiologists based on five criteria: (i) clarity of lines and tubes, (ii) definition of pulmonary vasculature, (iii) visibility of mediastinum, (iv) definition of the diaphragm and (v) degree of lung inflation. Linear regression, taking two radiologists' scores of each patient into account, was used to examine whether there were any differences in the criteria ratings between random and synchronized films. Radiologists and statistician were blinded. Results We recruited 110 patients; there were no complications from the breath-hold maneuver. Dosimeter readings were negligible. Synchronized films had higher total scores and mean scores for criteria (ii) to (v), 95% confidence interval. P values were statistically significant: for total score, P <0.001; and for criteria (ii), P = 0.001; (iii), P <0.001; (iv), P <0.01; and (v), P <0.001. Conclusions Synchronizing the CXR to end-inspiration improves the quality of the film and is safe. Reference 1.

Introduction A bedside chest ultrasound (bCUS) programme performed by intensivists after 18 months of training was introduced on a regular basis in a 10-bed emergency ICU from April to November 2008, in order to check its effectiveness in the early diagnosis and treatment of pleural effusion (PE). The results have been compared with those of a control group, when bCUS was not part of the ICU procedures. Methods The procedure was performed within the first 24 hours after admittance. All of the 92 patients were examined supine, with the probe perpendicular to the chest wall, using all of the intercostal spaces as the acoustic window. With this technique, once we identified the lung's base, we looked for signs of PE according to the following criteria: (a) space between the two pleural layers; (b) variation in the interpleural distance of this space during breathing. For each patient the following data were collected: age, sex, weight, height, SAPS II, number of chest drains, number of ultrasound scans performed, number of significant PE (at least 2 cm of width between the two pleurae), amount of ultrasound-guided drainage actually performed within the first 24 hours, timing of resolution of PE. Data were compared with those of a group of patients admitted to the ICU from January to March 2008, when bCUS was not part of the daily procedures and only chest CT and X-ray scans were used as evidence of PE. We considered P <0.05 statistically significant. Results A total of 103 bCUS were performed on the first day in the control group, against the 12 bCUS performed in the study group. A total of 59 PEs for which drainage proved to be useful were found. An amount of 27 pleural drainages were performed within the first 24 hours. We have no evidence of complications. All of the positive cases for PE have been successfully treated. All drainage was performed within the first 24 hours or at least within the first 48 hours. Conclusions Compared with the control group (25.9%), in the study group 45% of drainage performed was done within the first 24 hours thanks to the skill of intensivists. As far as PE is concerned, the introduction of bCUS performed by intensivists in the ICU daily routine determines an increase of early diagnosis and treatment. However, the increase in the number of the first-day treatments was not significant since this procedure is now turning from a purely diagnostic approach into an operative one. This will necessarily need time.


## Introduction

The quality of portable chest radiographs (CXRs) taken in the ICU is inferior to films taken in the radiology department. The inability of sedated, ventilated patients to hold their breath during CXR will also affect the degree of lung inflation and contribute to lack of correlation between serial CXR changes and clinical status [1]. We studied the effect on CXR quality by manually synchronizing the ventilator to end-inspiration in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Methods A pair of CXRs was taken after recruiting intubated, ventilated patients within 24 hours of emergency ICU admission. Intubated post-elective surgical patients were excluded due to the high likelihood of normal lungs. The control film was taken in the Introduction The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is beneficial in the hospital and home care environment. It is used to support ventilation during neurological disease, ventilatory defects, congestive heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea. Field emergency medicine has inherent complications for the delivery and monitoring of patients receiving CPAP. We completed an internal quality audit to determine whether CPAP had benefit and whether capnography could be comfortably used in parallel with a CPAP device to monitor ventilation. Methods The data collection was completed on patients with respiratory distress. Data were collected pre-CPAP and post-CPAP. Patients were monitored with capnography and pulse oximetry. Emergency Medical Services and Emergency Department staff evaluated acceptance and ease of use of the equipment. A one-tailed paired test and descriptive statistics were completed. Results Eighteen respiratory distress patients received CPAP: eight female, nine male and one patient had missing data (sex entry was blank). Mean age was 79 years. Statistical significance was determined at P <0.05. There was no significant difference in heart rate: mean pre-CPAP = 116, mean post-CPAP = 114, P = 0.19. There was a significant improvement in arterial oxygen saturation percentage: pre-CPAP = 81.5, mean post-CPAP = 90.2, P = 0.0003. There was a significant improvement in end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO 2 ) (ventilation parameter): mean pre-CPAP = 40.1, mean post-CPAP = 35.1, P = 0.038. There was a significant decrease in respiratory rate: pre-CPAP = 36, post-CPAP = 33, P = 0.031. Using a Borg scale for severity of respiratory distress, there was a significant improvement after CPAP: pre-CPAP = 8.06, post-CPAP = 5.7, P = 0.0001. The emergency medical technicians found the devices, CPAP, mask, and etCO 2 , easy to use, and 16 patients ranked it comfortable. Two patients were uncomfortable with CPAP. The most comfortable score was 10; the population scored the overall comfort of CPAP with etCO 2 at 7.8. Conclusions CPAP in field emergency medicine can be easily applied, is well tolerated, and results can be monitored by capnography. Capnographic measurements indicated improved ventilation by a decrease in carbon dioxide. CPAP and etCO 2 can be used in field emergencies to support and monitor ventilation during respiratory distress.

Introduction During mechanical ventilation, signal pulses within pressure and flow curves can be observed that are related to the activity of the beating heart. From a signal-processing view, these cardiogenic oscillations (COS) can be understood as repeated pulses that are transferred via the lungs and airways to the airway opening. It was demonstrated earlier that COS, achieved during breath-holding maneuvers, were influenced by changes in mechanical properties of the thorax [1]. We hypothesized that these COS can be extracted from the airway pressure and flow signal during spontaneous breathing. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these isolated signals contain information about the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. Methods Fifteen healthy volunteers breathed spontaneously against continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 0 to 9 cmH 2 O at normal thorax or at thorax bending, limiting motility to 90% of the normal circumference. Airway pressure and flow as well as an electrocardiogram were recorded at a sample frequency of 200 Hz. To isolate the signals that are related to the activity of the heart, pressure and flow data were aligned in time to the Rwave of the QRS complex and averaged. Results Highly characteristic pressure and flow oscillations could be extracted from the spontaneous breathing signals. Both signals were closely related (r 2 = 0.97 ± 0.02, each P <0.0001). The pressure amplitude of the COS was influenced by CPAP (P = 0.049) and thorax motility (P <0.001); in contrast, the flow amplitude was influenced only by thorax motility (P <0.001). Conclusions COS can be extracted from the airway pressure and flow signal during spontaneous breathing. They contain information about the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. After further investigations, our new method potentially allows an estimation of compliance of the respiratory system during spontaneous breathing. Introduction Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is useful for improving oxygenation, decreasing hypercapnia, and avoiding invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations and acute respiratory failure [1,2]. During the hospitalization, the treatment intensity is quite variable on the basis of the patient's clinical condition. Often, after the acute phase, patients need only periods of NIV followed by oxygenotherapy. NIV reduces the work of breathing and probably improves the respiratory muscular strength even when the ventilation is ended [3]. The aim of this study is to evaluate this effect in COPD submitted to NIV. Methods We studied 10 patients (seven male; three female; age 74.2 ± 5.3 years) admitted to our hospital with a COPD exacerbation and acute respiratory failure. After a period of clinical stabilization, patients underwent spirometry and arterial blood gas as basal examinations. For each patient, NIV was applied for 2 hours and than spirometry and arterial blood gas were repeated. Results are presented as mean ± SD. Data were evaluated by paired t test and a value of P <0.05 was taken as statistically significant.

Results At the end of NIV, the forced ventilatory capacity (FVC) and the forced expiratory volume at the first second (FEV1)/FVC ratio were significantly increased compared with the basal value: FVC 47.9 ± 11.0% basal, 55. Introduction Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is accepted as an effective and relatively complication-free method of respiratory support of premature infants [1,2]. We intended to compare the effectiveness of two nCPAP devices/approaches (Hudson prongs/bubble (H), and Infant Flow (IF)), in different groups of very low birth weight infants in a large trial. Methods Infants weighing 750 to 1,500 g, gestational age <32 weeks, were enrolled from April 2006 to July 2008 at 12 centers. The newborns, categorized into three study groups, were randomly assigned to one of the nCPAP devices in the first 6 hours of life. Study group A (n = 119) were neonates placed immediately on nCPAP. Group B (n = 157) were placed on nCPAP after receiving surfactant. Group C (n = 56) were treated with conventional ventilation and nCPAP was used as the method of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Results There were no statistically significant differences between the two devices with regard to treatment success, pneumothorax or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The incidence of severe nasal complications was lower in the infants treated with Infant Flow: 0.8% (IF), 6.6.% (H) (P = 0.01) in group A; 0.6% (IF), 5.1% (H) (P = 0.01) in group B; and 0% (IF), 5.3% (H) (P = 0.1) in group C. The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis was also lower in the group A infants treated with Infant Flow: 2.5% (IF), 8.3% (H) (P = 0.03).


## Conclusions (1)

The two nCPAP methods are comparable with regard to the incidence of pulmonary complications and primary effectiveness. (2) The Infant Flow method resulted in fewer severe nasal complications.


## Introduction

The development of hemodynamic instability following emergent endotracheal intubation and the initiation of positive pressure ventilation is a potentially life-threatening adverse event. Unfortunately, the incidence of post-intubation hemodynamic instability (PIHI) is relatively unknown. The objective of this study is to estimate the risk of PIHI in adult patients who require emergent intubation and to identify factors contributing to the likelihood of this adverse event.

Methods This is a systematic review of published adult, inhospital studies of emergent endotracheal intubation. A systematic search of Medline (1950 to November 2008) and relevant bibliographies was completed. No restrictions were placed on the language of publication, patient diagnosis, indication for intubation, or intubation method employed. One author independently reviewed all citations, and two authors reviewed all candidate articles during the process of final selection. Data were independently retrieved on a standardized data abstraction form by two authors. Randomeffects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of PIHI across studies. Results A total of 22 relevant studies were identified and included in our analysis. One randomized controlled trial and 21 observational studies met the eligibility criteria. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 2,833 patients (median, 214). The prevalence of postintubation hypotension ranged from 0% to 39%, with a randomeffects, pooled estimate of 8.5% (95% CI, 4.8% to 14.5%). Studies that defined PIHI with a temporal relationship between blood pressure reduction and intubation had a PIHI prevalence of 13.9% (95% CI, 8.8% to 21.2%) compared with a prevalence of 5.0% (95% CI, 1.6% to 15.0%) in studies that did not. Heterogeneity between studies limits conclusions on the effect of indication for intubation, intubator experience, medications utilized to facilitate intubation, and management strategies used for PIHI. Conclusions Post-intubation hemodynamic instability occurs commonly after emergent intubations. Efforts are required to identify risk factors, and potential preventative and therapeutic interventions for PIHI.

complication was tracheal stenosis, encountered in 15 patients (3%). The ICU mortality was 20.7%. Of the 351 patients discharged from the ICU, 45.8% were decannulated prior to discharge from the ICU and 31% in the ward; 23% of them could not be decannulated at any moment. Ward mortality in the group of patients decannulated in the ICU was 5%, 10% in the patients decannulated in the ward and 37% in those who failed decannulation, for a total of 50 deaths before hospital discharge (11%). The main diagnoses of the patients who died on the ward were: residual encephalopathy in 62% (postanoxic, posttraumatic or other causes), severe chronic respiratory failure in 10%, spinal cord injury in 6%, and neuromuscular disease in 4%.

Conclusions We had a low rate of early complications, similar to other series, with no procedure-related deaths [1]. Our main complication was airway stenosis. As in other studies, patients who needed a tracheostomy belonged to a group of patients with a high severity and mortality. Some of them do not recover a satisfactory neurological and functional status to be decannulated and present a high ward mortality. Introduction Unnecessary prolongation of mechanical ventilation is related to increased morbidity. On the contrary, early discontinuation of mechanical ventilation with reintubation is also related to bad prognosis. High respiratory rate, cardiac load and neuromuscular dysfunction are known factors related to weaning failure. Oxygen tissue saturation (StO 2 ) obtained by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) reflects the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption at the muscle level. StO 2 evolution during weaning may have a role in assessing respiratory muscle performance and help us to predict patient readiness to be weaned. The study objective is to describe respiratory muscle StO 2 during a T-tube test.

Methods A patient with mild head injury and pulmonary contusion was submitted to a T-tube trial after obtaining stability on day 5. The NIRS signal from serratus anterior muscle was acquired by placing an Inspectra device probe on the skin surface of the   [1]. Simultaneously, the respiratory rate, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded. Results After 5 minutes the patient failed on his first T-tube trial, showing profuse sweating, accessory muscle recruitment and increasing respiratory rate and mean arterial pressure ( Figure 1). The StO 2 signal decreased during ventilatory failure until the patient was on assistance again. Conclusions NIRS was sensitive to respiratory muscle fatigue but further research is in process to assess its predictive capability. Introduction There is evidence that formal weaning protocols can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and complications of prolonged unnecessary ventilation [1]. In our ICU we do not employ a formal protocol, but have a standard practice where patients with spontaneous respiratory efforts on pressurecontrolled ventilation (PCV) have a trial of assisted spontaneous breathing (ASB). Patients on ASB with pressure support ≤10 cmH 2 O will then have a trial of unassisted continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with high-flow oxygen.

Methods A retrospective audit was conducted on 47 patients in a 13-bed general medical and surgical ICU of a university hospital. The length of time between first spontaneous breaths while on PCV and a trial of ASB was recorded. The length of time from achieving pressure support ≤10 cmH 2 O on ASB to a trial of unassisted CPAP was recorded. A retrograde step was defined as going back on to PCV from ASB, or to ASB from unassisted CPAP. If the trial of weaning was repeated within 12 hours of a retrograde step, this was noted as a continuous attempt at weaning. Similar data were collected for subsequent retrograde steps.


## Results

The median duration of MV from initiation to discontinuation was 85 hours (range 1 to 345 hours), with a median time of 37 hours (range 1 to 245 hours) on PCV and 32 hours (range 0 to 264 hours) on ASB. The median time from recorded spontaneous breaths on PCV to ASB was 1 hour (range 0 to 34 hours). Twenty-nine (62%) patients on PCV progressed on ASB without any retrograde steps. The median time from having pressure support ≤10 cmH 2 O on ASB to unassisted CPAP was 2 hours (range 0 to 41 hours). Thirty-one (66%) patients on ASB progressed on CPAP without any retrograde steps. Forty-one patients (87.2%) had a first attempt to wean from PCV to ASB and 40 patients (85%) from ASB to CPAP within 10 hours of eligibility. Maximum delay in initiating first attempts to ASB was 34 hours, and 41 hours to CPAP. Reasons for retrograde steps included respiratory instability (n = 19), signs of poor tolerance or haemodynamic instability on ASB/unassisted CPAP (n = 18) and interventions, for example bronchoscopy, imaging, theatre, and so forth (n = 13).


## Conclusions

The median duration on MV in our unit compares favourably with a large randomised controlled trial with a similar patient population [1]. Most patients had their first attempt to wean within 10 hours from eligibility. A significant number of patients may have weaned more quickly if a formal protocol was in place. Introduction Several diseases of different origin as well as prolonged mechanical ventilation result in diaphragmatic dysfunction and atrophy. To date most in vitro experiments on the mechanics of diaphragm muscles are performed at isolated muscle strips. Since the improvement of the knowledge about the diaphragm functionality is lacking in view of the position and curvature, a model of the whole diaphragm appears necessary. Here we present a new in vitro model of an isolated whole rat diaphragm inside a bioreactor [1]. Methods The bioreactor consists of a pressure chamber on which a highly flexible membrane is attached. A rat diaphragm is fixed on this membrane. By application of a gas volume into the pressure chamber, a defined deflection of the diaphragm is achieved. The highly flexible membrane adapts a given shape thus allowing the diaphragm to take up its in vivo profile. Electrical stimulation results in a contraction of the diaphragm. These diaphragm-twitches generate pressure pulses inside the pressure chamber. Rat diaphragms were excised rapidly and kept at room temperature in Krebs-Henseleit solution bubbled with oxygen. By application of one of two different initial pressures (P1: 7 mbar; P2: 12 mbar) the diaphragms were set to a defined degree of deflection. Using a platinum wire electrode, the diaphragms were electrically stimulated at impulses of 6V. The stimulation train duration was set to 500 ms or 1 second. The pulse duration was set to 50 ms at a frequency of 50 Hz. The pressure pulses resulting as the response on muscle contraction were measured inside the pressure chamber.

Results An increase of the initial pressure led to an increased pressure caused by the muscle contraction. An enlarged muscle regeneration time led to an increase of the diaphragmatic twitchinduced pressure.


## Conclusions

Our new in vitro model of an isolated whole rat diaphragm allows the performance of mechanical and physiological investigations on the entire diaphragm. A dependency of pressure development of the diaphragm on its deflection state could be demonstrated. Furthermore, we found effects of diaphragm muscle fatigue. Our new model could be used in numerous types of investigations, such as releasing factors of diaphragmatic dysfunction or respiratory muscle fatigue.  Introduction Supplemental oxygen is part of the supportive treatment of hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Prolonged exposure to high fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) has been shown to be injurious to the lung in vitro [1]. The optimal paO 2 in critical illness has not been established but the clinical impression is that patients are frequently exposed to a higher FiO 2 than is necessary. The aim of this study was to investigate current oxygen treatment in patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation and determine whether this resulted in exposure to a higher FiO 2 than that required to adequately oxygenate haemoglobin (SaO 2 >95%). Methods Indices of oxygenation were collected for 30 patients requiring mechanical ventilation >2 days. Data were collected 4-hourly for 48 hours. The PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio was determined for each data point and used to model the theoretical FiO 2 required to maintain an SaO 2 of 95% (paO 2 = 10.7 kPa).


## Results

The results are shown in Figure 1. Data are expressed as medians (IQR). The median observed FiO 2 was 0.4 throughout the study whereas the median FiO 2 , calculated to maintain an SaO 2 of 95%, was 0.3. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that critically ill patients may be exposed to a higher FiO 2 than that required to maintain adequate oxygenation. Further, these results highlight an area of ICU care that has received little study, with no published clinical trials examining the effect of FiO 2 on outcome. Reference 1.  Introduction Pleural effusion is a common finding in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients.

However, the effect of pleural effusion on gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ALI/ARDS patients, during mechanical ventilation, has never been prospectively studied. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of ALI/ARDS, who underwent a CT scan at 5 cmH 2 O PEEP for clinical reasons, were included in the study. Lung and pleural effusion were outlined separately; lung total weight and pleural effusion volume were computed with dedicated software. A PEEP test at 5 and 15 cmH 2 O with constant minute ventilation was performed. Exclusion criteria were: age <18 years, hemodynamic instability, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and evidence of barotrauma.

Results We enrolled 11 ALI/ARDS patients (10 male). The mean clinical characteristics on admission to the ICU were: age 67.5 ± 9.9 years, BMI 24.4 ± 2.1 kg/m 2 , PaO 2 /FiO 2 203.1 ± 56.1 mmHg, PEEP 9.1 ± 2.8 cmH 2 O and pH 7.394 ± 0.048. The volume of pleural effusion was not significantly related with the change in PaCO 2 (r 2 = 0.068; P = 0.437), PaO 2 (r 2 = 0.015; P = 0.722) and dead space (VD/VT) (r 2 = 0.019; P = 0.682) going from PEEP 15 to PEEP 5 cmH 2 O. Conclusions Pleural effusion does not seem to influence the gasexchange response to PEEP.

Introduction Different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) associated or not with alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM) may have a significant impact on ventilator-induced lung injury [1], but this issue has not been well addressed in a model of lung injury using inhaled hydrochloric acid. We aimed to evaluate the effects of PEEP and ARM on respiratory mechanics and lung tissue in an inhaled hydrochloric acid acute lung injury (ALI) model. Methods Thirty-two pigs (22.9 ± 2.8 kg), were randomly allocated into one of four groups (I -Control-PEEP, II -Control-ARM, III -ALI-PEEP, IV -ALI-ARM). ALI was induced by intratracheal instillation of hydrochloric acid. PEEP values were progressively increased and decreased from 5, 10, 15 and 20 cmH 2 O in all groups. Three alveolar recruitment maneuvers of 40 cmH 2 O for 20 seconds were applied to the assigned groups at each interval of PEEP level increase or decrease. Histological analysis was made to evaluate the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, alveolar wall thickening, atelectasis, hemorrhage, alveolar edema and alveolar disruption. Histomorphometrical analyses of the lungs were also performed to determine alveolar dimensions. Results Inflammation and alveolar disruption were statistically greater in group II when compared with group I. There were no statistical differences between groups III and IV with respect to hemorrhage, alveolar edema, inflammation and alveolar disruption. Mean alveolar area and mean alveolar intercept were higher in group IV when compared with groups I and II (P <0.05). The mean alveolar area was significantly smaller in the diaphragmatic lobes when compared with other middle and upper pulmonary lobes, but no statistical difference was found among groups. Conclusions The association of PEEP with ARM promoted a greater degree of alveolar disruption. Acknowledgement Grants from LIM08-Anesthesia; FAPESP 02/08621-1. Postoperative pulmonary dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is a significant clinical problem and has long been recognized. Postoperative hypoxemia carries high morbidity leading to prolonged postoperative recovery and hospital stays. We hypothesized that adding high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) would be effective for treatment of postoperative hypoxemia after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, independently of the mode of ventilation or the use of nitric oxide. Methods During 2 years, 210 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass with pump surgery after diagnosis of hypoxemia (PO 2 /FiO 2 <200) were randomized into six groups after operation (35 in each group): pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with inhaled nitric oxide and ideal PEEP (group 1), PCV without inhaled nitric oxide and ideal PEEP (group 2), PCV without inhaled nitric oxide and PEEP 5 cmH 2 O (group 3), volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) with inhaled nitric oxide and ideal PEEP (group 4), VCV without inhaled nitric oxide and ideal PEEP (group 5) and VCV without inhaled nitric oxide and PEEP 5 cmH 2 O (group 6). Arterial and mixed venous blood were drawn and analyzed before the interventions, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after the interventions in the ICU to determine the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio. Hemodynamic measurements were analyzed. The time to extubation was compared among groups, accordingly to the ICU weaning protocol. Results There was no significant difference among the groups regarding hemodynamic measurements (mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure and SVO 2 ). Oxygenation was higher in both high-PEEP groups (groups 1, 2, 4 and 5) than in the PEEP 5 groups (groups 3 and 6) during the mechanical ventilation period (P <0.01). Also, the time to extubation was significantly lower in high PEEP groups than in the PEEP 5 groups (220 min vs. 428 min, P <0.03).

Conclusions Ventilation with high PEEP after cardiac surgery is associated with improvement of oxygenation and less time of mechanical ventilation independently of the mode of ventilation and of the use of nitric oxide.

Control system for automated titration of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume using dynamic nonlinear compliance as the setpoint S18 ventilator to the respiratory system. The controller titrates the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (VT) to ventilate the lung at its maximal compliance in order to avoid excessive lung overinflation as well as underinflation. Methods The mechanics controller consists of a software program to set PEEP and VT and a user interface to observe the compliance and the controller state. The program has following structure:

(1) Dynamic compliance is calculated breath by breath using the implemented slice function [1]. This function divides VT into six consecutive volume slices of equal size. (2) For each volume slice, one value of dynamic compliance (CSLICE) is determined by leastsquares fit using the linear resistance and compliance model within each slice [2]. The six CSLICE values are plotted over the corresponding volume, giving the compliance-volume curve. (3) The shape-compliance function of the controller identifies one out of six shape categories [3]. (4) The PEEP and VT-change function calculates the PEEP and VT titration depending on the shape category and sends a command to the ventilator for setting the new PEEP and VT automatically.


## Results

The system was tested with previously recorded patient data (McRem) [4]. The compliance controller retrospectively analysed the respiratory data and determined the shape category depending on the course of CSLICE. For shapes representing an intratidal increase of CSLICE, the controller increased the PEEP. A reduction of PEEP occurred when CSLICE decreased intratidally. PEEP was maintained when CSLICE was maximal and constant. Furthermore, for hybrid shape categories (one part in the linear region and one part in the increasing and/or decreasing region) the VT was reduced. Conclusions The automated respiratory mechanics control system titrates PEEP and VT automatically until intratidal compliance reaches its maximal value within an appropriate VT. 


## Introduction

The optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a balance between the prevention of overdistention in the nondependent part and alveolar collapse in the dependent part. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been introduced to monitor regional change of ventilation at the bedside. We evaluated the effect of changes in PEEP on regional ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients with or without lung disorders.

Methods Functional EIT (fEIT) images were obtained in 14 patients on pressure-controlled ventilation with constant driving pressure at four PEEP levels (15, 10, 5 and 0 cmH 2 O). fEIT images made before each reduction in PEEP were subtracted from those recorded after each PEEP step to evaluate the regional increase/decrease in tidal impedance in each EIT pixel.


## Results

The response of regional tidal impedance to PEEP showed a significant difference from 15 to 10 cmH 2 O (P = 0.002) and from 10 to 5 cmH 2 O (P = 0.001) between patients with and without lung disorders ( Figure 1). During the decrease in PEEP from 15 to 10 cmH 2 O, tidal impedance increased in the ventral parts in both groups, but decreased markedly in the dorsal parts in the patients with lung disorders. From PEEP 10 to 5 cmH 2 O, tidal impedance increased in the ventral parts and decreased in the dorsal parts in patients without lung disorders, whereas in patients with lung disorders tidal impedance decreased in both regions. Lowering the PEEP from 5 to 0 cmH 2 O decreased tidal impedance in both regions in both groups.

Conclusions During a decremental PEEP trial, EIT can visualize improvement or loss of ventilation in dependent and nondependent parts, indicating lung collapse or decreased overdistention.

Introduction Monitoring the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) is a valuable tool to optimize respiratory settings that could be of particular importance in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. We evaluated the feasibility and precision of an ICU ventilator with an inbuilt nitrogen washout/washin technique in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. Methods Duplicate EELV measurements were performed in 26 patients between 5 and 30 kg after cardiac surgery. All measurements were taken during pressure-controlled ventilation at 0 cmH 2 O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Results Linear regression between duplicate measurements was excellent (R 2 = 0.99). Also, there was good agreement between duplicate measurements, bias -1.0% (-1.7 ml) ± 5.7% (15.5 ml) ( Figure 1). The mean EELV was 18.9 ± 4.4 ml/kg at 0 cmH 2 O PEEP. The EELV correlated significantly with age (P <0.001, Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine

Introduction Intraabdominal hypertension is a condition affecting respiratory mechanics in many situations such as laparoscopy or morbid obesity. We investigated the effects of different intraabdominal pressures (IAP) at different positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels on nonlinear respiratory mechanics and the effects on hemodynamics and oxygenation in a rat model. The application of a pneumoperitoneum served as a model for elevated IAP. Methods A helium pneumoperitoneum was established in 20 anesthetized female Wistar rats that were randomly allocated to one of four PEEP levels (0, 3, 6 and 9 mbar). IAP of 9, 12, 15 and 18 mbar was instilled in a random sequence in each rat, followed by respiratory mechanics measurement and blood gas analysis. From the low flow maneuvers' pressure-volume loops, the lower inflection point and the mathematical turning point within the expiratory limb were detected and compared with the IAP applied during the measurement. For investigation of the lung's intratidal compliance, 10 consecutive breaths before and after low flow maneuvers were analyzed. Intratidal nonlinear compliance was calculated using a modified SLICE method [1]. Results A higher IAP led to a decreased steepness of quasi-static pressure-volume loops resulting in a right shift of the expiratory lower inflection point. The pressure at the mathematical turning point of the expiratory limb correlated well with the IAP (r = 0.97, P <0.001). Intratidal compliance decreased with increasing IAP before and after the low flow maneuvers. After execution of the low flow maneuvers the compliance increased. Relative compliance gain caused by the low flow maneuvers was dependent on PEEP, IAP and slice (all P <0.001). The peak inspiratory pressure increased with increasing IAP and was significantly smaller after recruitment maneuvers (P <0.001). The peak inspiratory pressure was dependent on PEEP and IAP (P <0.001). PaO 2 was dependent on PEEP (P = 0.008) but not on IAP (P = 0.153). Arterial pressure was not dependent on PEEP (P = 0.068) or IAP (P = 0.292).

Conclusions Intraabdominal hypertension alters respiratory mechanics. IAP has no effect on oxygenation as long as PEEP is applied. The examination of nonlinearity holds important information for the evaluation of respiratory mechanics. The success of recruitment maneuvers on healthy lungs depends strongly on the IAP. Introduction Vibration response imaging (VRI) is a bedside lung sound monitoring system. The VRI measurement has been proven sensitive to changes in ventilator settings, including changes in the mode of mechanical ventilation or in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In the present study, we correlate lung sound distribution with functional residual capacity (FRC). Methods Thirty-nine lung sound measurements were performed on seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients at different levels of PEEP before and after recruitment maneuver. The FRC was obtained for each measurement. Lung sound distribution was monitored using the sound distribution index (SDI), an index revealing the lung sound distribution at peak inspiration and computed from the percentages of lung sound distribution in four lung segments (right lower (RL), left lower (LL), right upper (RU), left upper (LU)) as SDI = 100 -abs(RL + LL -RU -LU) / 2abs(RU + LU -RL -LL) / 2 (range 0% to 100%). P values were obtained using the Wilcoxon two-sample test.

Results Significantly increased mean (± SD) SDI was registered in cases with higher FRC. In two out of five measurements with FRC above 2.9 l, a low SDI was obtained (~70%). Conclusions Lung SDI significantly increased with FRC. At very high volumes, a decreased SDI may indicate possible hyperinflation.

Introduction Improvement of oxygenation during acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requires a high level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to recruit nonaerated lung zones and decrease pulmonary shunt. However, monitoring of alveolar recruitment at the bedside is difficult, as neither the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, thoracopulmonary compliance or generation of pressure curve are indices of alveolar recruitment and avoidance of lung hyperinflation. Monitoring of the functional residual capacity (FRC) at the bedside may be useful to monitor directly lung recruitment and to optimize the PEEP level [1]. The aims of this study are to evaluate the FRC by a modified nitrogen Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1

S20 multiple washout technique (NMBW) in ALI/ARDS patients, and to set PEEP levels on data of FRC values. Methods Twenty patients with ALI/ARDS were enrolled in the study. All patients were ventilated in pressure-controlled ventilation with an Engstrom carestation ventilator (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) in accordance with the ARDSnet guidelines. FRC measurement was carried out with the COVX module integrated within the ventilator (GE Healthcare) by a NMBW technique. Every patient had a basal FRC measurement and then three measurements at PEEP 15/10/5 cmH 2 O during a derecruiting maneuver. After all measurements, PEEP was set as the PEEP at which value FRC started to decrease. At basal time (T0) and after setting the best PEEP (T1) the PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio and static compliance were measured too. All data are reported as the mean ± SD. A t test was used to compare changes during time.

Results Table 1 presents the main results of the study. Conclusions FRC measurement by the NMBW technique integrated in the ventilator is useful to assess functional lung impairment at the bedside. Setting PEEP on FRC measurements may improve lung recruitment and oxygenation, but anatomical studies (CT scan) are also warranted. Introduction Early identification of progression to acute lung injury (ALI) in patients at risk may change therapy and potentially improve outcome. Central to the pathogenesis of ALI is pulmonary microvascular injury and increased permeability resulting in pulmonary edema. We proposed that the pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) (extravascular lung water (EVLW) (ml) / pulmonary blood volume (PBV) (ml)) reflects the severity of this injury and predicts progression to ALI in patients at risk. Methods The PVPI was measured prospectively in 27 patients who either were at increased risk to develop ALI (n = 17) or who had ALI on presentation (n = 10) for the first 5 days after admission to the ICU. Results Ten out of 17 patients at risk for ALI progressed to it. The mean (± SEM) PVPI on day 1 was lower in patients who did not develop ALI vs. those that did (1.4 ± 0.1 vs. 2.6 ± 0.4, P = 0.01) in the 17 patients who did not have ALI on presentation ( Figure 1). There was no difference in PVPI for those that developed ALI vs. those that had it on presentation (2.6 ± 0.4 vs. 2.7 ± 0.3, P = 0.5).

A cutoff PVPI value of 1.9 or less discriminated those that would not develop ALI from those who did or who had it on presentation with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 85%, respectively ( Figure 2).

Conclusions Increased PVPI is a feature of early ALI and predicts progression to ALI in patients at increased risk. Early identification of patients with elevated PVPI and who are at risk to develop ALI may lead to consideration of early initiation of lung protective ventilator strategies.

Introduction Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a promising bedside device with the potential to assess changes in regional ventilation and lung blood flow [1]. The purpose of our study was to monitor lung images and changes in impedance by EIT in a model of hemorrhagic shock with endotoxemia followed by fluid resuscitation.

Methods Twelve anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, supine pigs were submitted to hemorrhagic shock (50% blood volume) and endotoxin infusion. Animals were randomly allocated to control

(n = 6) or a treatment group with lactated Ringer's (n = 6). The mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), blood gas, extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI), lung compliance and pulmonary EIT (Dräger, Germany) were measured before shock (T basal ), 60 minutes after hemorrhagic shock (T shock ) and hourly in the treatment period (T 1 , T 2 and T 3 ). Statistical analysis was based on one-way ANOVA (P <0.05). Results In T shock there was a significant decrease in MAP, CVP, SvO 2 , lung compliance, cardiac index, EVLWI and ITBVI and an increase in lactate (P <0.05). Fifty percent of control animals died between T 2 and T 3 . In treated animals, at T 3 the EVLWI reached values near those of T basal whereas ITBVI remained below baseline (P <0.05) and above T shock (P <0.05). There was sensible change in functional EIT images ( Figure 1) and significant differences in impedance along time. Significant global impedance change occurred in T 2 relative to T shock (P <0.05). Most of the EIT changes were attributable to the ventral lobes (local 1 ), which showed significant differences in T 2 and T 3 relative to T basal (P <0.05) and of T 1 , T 2 and T 3 relative to T shock (P <0.05).

Conclusions Pulmonary impedance changes induced by the proposed model of shock and resuscitation were monitored successfully with the EIT device. Changes were suggestive of alterations in regional ventilation and ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Introduction Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has the potential for bedside monitoring of regional lung function. Evaluation of EIT imaging requires the identification of the lung area in the images. A functional EIT-based method (fEIT) has been proposed to identify the lung area in EIT images for patients with healthy lungs [1,2]. However, in patients with certain lung diseases, the fEIT method will fail to include those lung regions where a low ventilation change is present. Besides, identified lung regions may include the cardiac-related area. A method to estimate the lung area accurately is missing. The aim of this study was to develop an improved method for lung area estimation in EIT images (LAE), which is suitable for both healthy subjects and patients with serious pulmonary diseases. Methods In our LAE method, the lung area as determined by fEIT is mirrored and the cardiac-related area, which is distinguished in the frequency domain, is subtracted. Forty-nine mechanically ventilated patients were investigated (test group: 39 patients, thoracic surgery; control group: 10 patients, orthopedic surgery without pulmonary disease). An EIT video sequence of 5 minutes duration comprising about 60 breathing cycles from every participant was recorded and subsequently analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA. P <0.01 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as means and standard deviations.

Results It is assumed that the fraction of the lung in the thorax for different people should be more or less in the same range, in spite of the state of the lung. The sizes of the lung area determined with fEIT are in control group S_C, fEIT = 361 ± 35.1 and in test group S_T, fEIT = 299 ± 60.8 (P <0.01). On the contrary, the sizes estimated with the LAE method are in control group S_C, LAE = 353 ± 27.2 and in test group S_T, LAE = 353 ± 61.1 (P = 0.41). Conclusions The result demonstrates that the novel LAE method can better access the lung region in EIT images, from which the analysis of regional lung ventilation will benefit. Further validation will be pursued by comparing the results with anatomic computed tomography image of the chest morphology. Introduction Micromechanical properties of alveolar walls are needed for finite element modeling of the lung that in turn may be used to guide mechanical ventilation therapy. The aim of this project is to develop an endomicroscopic device [1] to measure the local mechanics of alveolar walls in vitro and in vivo under varying conditions. Here we report on the development and the evaluation of the endoscopic system, which is -on the first runperformed in an artificial environment (bioreactor) with known mechanical properties. Methods A system of two concentric trocars was built to adjust and monitor the local pressure by means of a flushing fluid in the endoscopic field of view. The fluid is pumped through the double trocar system that is surrounding the endoscope. By adjusting the flow rate of the fluid, the mean pressure P2 in the endoscopic field of view, can be kept constant. The alveolar pressure is changed by adjusting the airway pressure P1. The transpulmonary pressure (Pt) for the observed subpleural alveoli is thus Pt = P1 -P2 ( Figure 1b). Pt is varied by applying different continuous positive airway pressure values to animal-model airways. The mechanical reaction of the observed alveoli is, thereby, recorded by video endoscopy. Assuming that the recorded outlines reflect changes in the diameter of an observed alveolus allows calculation of mechanical properties such as the stress-strain relationship of the alveolar wall. For evaluation, the endoscopic system is applied to an artificial membrane with known mechanical properties in a bioreactor. A pattern of particles on the membrane allows quantifying the three-dimensional deformation under pressure changes. Mechanical membrane properties can be determined by the relation between membrane-deformation and transmembrane pressure Pm = Pa -Pb (Figure 1a).

## Introduction

In several studies it has been shown that inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (NO and iloprost) can decrease the pulmonary hypertension and also improve the oxygenation during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. We investigated the effects of prone and supine positioning on the effects of inhaled iloprost in an animal-ARDS model. Methods After approval of the animal ethics committee, 10 pigs were anesthetized and intubated. Invasive systemic and pulmonary arterial catheterizations were performed (T1). ARDS was induced in all animals with the infusion of oleic acid (0.15 to 0.30 ml/kg). The study design is shown in Figure 1. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters and ventilation parameters were measured; arterial and mixed venous blood samples were drawn; and were recorded in T1 to T6. Pigs were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation mode with FiO 2 100%, with 4 cmH 2 O positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) in the beginning and with 8 cmH 2 O PEEP after induction of ARDS. Statistical analysis was made with Student's t test, repeated measures of ANOVA (with Tukey as the post-hoc test) and paired t tests. P <0.05 was significant. Results There was no significant difference between the sequences. Iloprost decreased the mean pulmonary arterial pressure in both supine (37 vs. 31 mmHg) and prone (38 vs. 29 mmHg) positions significantly, but there was no significant difference between both positions. Prone position was associated with an improvement in oxygenation compared with supine position both with or without iloprost application. There was no spillover effect of iloprost. Conclusions Iloprost decreased pulmonary arterial pressures in both positions. On the other hand, the prone position improved oxygenation. The decrease in pulmonary arterial pressures and improvement in oxygenation was better in prone position + iloprost; however, these findings were not statistically significant. Introduction Endothelial injury is an important prognostic factor in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1,2]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in endothelial destruction and angiogenesis [3]. The expression of VEGF in ARDS varies, depending on epithelial and endothelial damage [4,5]. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of VEGF in lung tissue from ARDS patients. Methods Lung specimens were obtained by autopsy from 10 patients with severe ARDS and were compared with a control group of 10 non-ARDS patients autopsied. All lung samples were stained for standard histopathological analysis and for immunohistochemical methods using a specific mouse monoclonal antibody.

Results Compared with expression in non-ARDS control individuals, pulmonary expression of VEGF was significantly decreased (P <0.001) in ARDS patients. Alveolar macrophages were similarly immunopositive in both groups. No differences were noted with regard to the individual patient's characteristics (age, gender, period of ARDS condition, number of ICU days). Conclusions A decrease in alveolar type II cellularity, due to apoptosis, has been observed during ARDS that may reduce the production of VEGF in the alveolar space and may participate in the decrease in lung perfusion.

Introduction A retrospective observational study was conducted to evaluate whether the plasma level of soluble E-selectin [1] might be a specific pathologic marker of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Methods The data of 52 critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and initiated on mechanical ventilation were retrospectively evaluated.


## Results

The plasma levels of soluble E-selectin determined within 24 hours of admission were significantly correlated with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores determined within 24 hours of admission. Furthermore, the scores for both respiratory failure (evaluated by the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio) and liver dysfunction (evaluated by the serum bilirubin value) in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scoring system were significantly correlated with plasma levels of soluble E-selectin. In relation to respiratory failure, the plasma level of soluble E-selectin was higher in patients with ALI/ARDS than in those without (Figure 1), and receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that this parameter might be a specific marker of ALI/ARDS ( Figure 2).

Conclusions Soluble E-selectin might be specific and useful marker for the clinicopathologic assessment of ALI/ARDS in critically ill patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. However, further investigation is clearly needed to determine whether soluble E-selectin can indeed predict the development of ALI/ARDS. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1

## Introduction

In vitro studies have shown that cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) can be cleaved by neutrophil elastase with a resulting reduction in affinity for cortisol [1]. Local elastase production by activated neutrophils may trigger cortisol release by CBG cleavage, providing a potential mechanism for targeted delivery of corticosteroids to inflamed tissues. We looked for evidence of this process at sites of inflammation in critically ill patients. Methods Sera and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected from six mechanically ventilated patients with a clinical diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These samples, along with sera from six healthy controls, were subjected to gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting for CBG. Densitometry was used to quantify the proportion of cleaved CBG. Results CBG cleavage product was seen within the BAL but not the sera of patients with acute inflammatory lung disease. Figure 1 shows a typical western blot comparing control sera (C1 and C2), septic sera (S1 and S2) and BAL from the same septic patients (B1 and B2, respectively). The mean percentage of CBG in the cleaved form was 63.3% ± 21.8 in BAL compared with 0.94% ± 1.73 in sera from the same patients and 12.5% ± 11.4 from healthy controls (see Figure 2; all comparisons statistically significant).

Conclusions This study provides the first in vivo support for a mechanism of enhanced cortisol delivery to sites of inflammation that involves local CBG cleavage.

Introduction Cell-to-cell communication via gap junctions has been implicated in the control of vascular tone and may be altered in sepsis. Endothelial cells express connexin (Cx) 37, Cx40 and Cx43 and cytokines may modulate their function in sepsis resulting in altered gap junctional intercellular communication. Our hypothesis is that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) will decrease gap-junctiondependent cell-to-cell communication of vascular connexin. Methods Transformed HeLa cells expressing vascular Cx37, Cx40 or Cx43 were used in these experiments. HeLa cells were treated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for up to 2 hours. In dye-transfer experiments, carboxyfluroscein (HeLaCx40 and HeLaCx43) or Alexa Fluor-480 (HeLaCx37) was injected into one cell for 10 seconds and cell transfer was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes and the number of labeled cells counted. Cell lysates were prepared in Triton X-100 lysate buffer and detergent-soluble fractions collected. Cx37, Cx40 and Cx43 were detected by western blot. Results After 1 hour, TNF treatment resulted in near total loss of dye-coupling in HeLaCx37 and HeLaCx43 (P <0.02, n = 14 to 16) and remained constant up to 2 hours. Dye coupling in HeLaCx40 cells remained unchanged after 1 hour and decreased after 2 hours (P <0.05, n = 10). Western blots indicated that TNF treatment did not affect detergent solubility of Cx40 and Cx43. However, TNF caused a significant increase in detergent solubility of Cx37.

Conclusions These results suggest that inflammatory mediators affect connexins differently. The loss of Cx37 function may be due to the loss of detergent resistance, suggesting internalization of Cx37 in response to TNF.


## Introduction

The most appropriate advanced airway intervention in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains unproven. Trained ambulance personnel may attempt endotracheal intubation in the field for OHCA patients. This study aims to review prehospital airway management in OHCA.

Methods Observational, retrospective case review over a 4-year period. All cases of OHCA brought to the Emergency Department of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Scotland were identified. Patient demographics, the airway management technique and documented complications were recorded. The primary endpoint measure was survival to hospital admission. Results In total, 794 OHCA cases were identified. The aetiology of cardiac arrest was medical in 95.2%, traumatic in 3.9% and unrecorded in 0.9% of cases. Prehospital endotracheal intubation was attempted in 628 (79%) cases and was successful in 573 (91.2%) cases. A significant complication (multiple attempts, displaced endotracheal tube or oesophageal intubation) occurred in 55 (8.8%) cases. In total, 165 (20.8%) patients survived to hospital admission, of whom 110 (17.5%) had undergone prehospital intubation. Fifty-five (33.1%) patients who did not undergo prehospital intubation survived to hospital admission. Conclusions Prehospital endotracheal intubation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with significant complications. For ambulance crews not routinely undertaking endotracheal intubation, a supraglottic airway device may be more appropriate. Reliable methods of confirming endotracheal intubation in the field should be utilised.


## Introduction

The study evaluated the ability of focused echocardiography (F-ECHO) and capnography to differentiate between pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and pseudo-PEA during resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA In the NON-ECHO group, significantly higher doses of epinephrine were needed (P = 0.009) and CPR lasted longer (P = 0.003).

Conclusions F-ECHO and capnography during PEA in OHCA facilitates return of spontaneous circulation, ICU admission, 24hour survival, and hospital survival. This effect was attributed to the ability to distinguish between PEA and pseudo-PEA and to institute appropriate treatment during CPR. The confirmation of these results in a large study is warranted.


## Introduction

The overall incidence of ventricular tachycardia/ ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) as the first recorded electrical rhythm in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has declined from ~70% to ~25% over the past 30 years. This change has been attributed to primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and VT/VF. We evaluated whether the incidence of VT/VF as first recorded rhythm differed by location among bystander-applied automatic external defibrillator (AED) patients and emergency medical services (EMS)-witnessed cardiac arrests. Methods A prospective cohort study of nontraumatic cardiac arrest from December 2005 to April 2007 in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium database from 10 US and Canadian sites. The incidence of an initial shockable rhythm on AED or documented VT/VF was compared among bystander-applied AED patients and EMS-witnessed arrests in public versus private settings. Results The first rhythm was known in 13,235 out of 14,059 (94%) adult EMS-treated cardiac arrests. Of the 13,235 with known rhythms, 3,436 (26%) had VT/VF. Among 1,115 EMSwitnessed arrests, 61/161 (38%) had VT/VF in public settings and 224/954 (23%) in private settings. Similarly, for bystander AED applied in the private setting, 39/114 (34%) were shocked. But, in contrast, 125/159 (79%) (P <0.001 vs. all other) were shocked by the AED in the public setting. Witnessed arrests in both the private setting (vs. public) and in EMS-witnessed cases (vs. bystander AED applied) were more likely to occur in older subjects and females. After adjusting for age and gender via logistic regression models, a significant difference in the odds of having a shockable rhythm in a public versus private location of arrest remained in EMS-witnessed arrests (P <0.005). The difference also remained in bystander AED-applied arrests (P <0.001) after adjusting for age, gender, and bystander-witnessed status.


## Conclusions

The incidence of VT/VF is far greater in the public setting particularly for bystander-witnessed AED-applied arrests. Patients in the private home setting, even for EMS-observed arrests, are far less likely to benefit from AED application than bystander-witnessed patients in the public setting. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation strategies may need to be tailored by arrest location.

Introduction To improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the American Heart Association released guidelines in 2005. We examined the effect of these guidelines on survival in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Epistry -Cardiac Arrest. We hypothesized that survival would increase after guideline implementation. Methods One hundred and seventy-four emergency medical service (EMS) agencies from eight out of 10 ROC sites were surveyed to determine 2005 American Heart Association guideline implementation, or crossover, date. Two sites with 2005 compatible treatment algorithms prior to guideline release were not included. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to a noncardiac cause, EMS-witnessed events, patients <18 years old, and patients with do-not-resuscitate orders were excluded. A linear mixed-effects model was applied for survival controlling for time and agency. The crossover date was added to the model to determine the effect of the 2005 guidelines. Results Of 174 agencies, 83 contributed cases to both cohorts during the 18-month period between 1 December 2005 and 31 May 2007. Of 7,403 cases, 4,897 occurred during the 13-month (median) interval before crossover and 2,506 occurred in the 5-month (median) interval after crossover. The overall survival rate was 5.9%. Our model estimated an overall increase in survival over time (monthly OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.04, P = 0.23), a decrease in survival at crossover (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.66 to 1.26, P = 0.59), and a further increase in survival over time after crossover (monthly = OR 1.005, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.05, P = 0.84). Conclusions The present study found a trend towards increased survival over time and no statistically significant effect of the 2005 guidelines early after implementation. This observed increase in survival over time may be attributed to the Hawthorne effect or participation in the ROC or improved quality assurance. A delay in knowledge and skill acquisition amongst EMS providers and the need to rechoreograph their cardiac arrest treatment may explain why no significant increase in survival was observed after implementation. EMS providers may require more time to gain proficiency in the guideline changes before the full potential of the guidelines can be realized. Further longitudinal study is needed to determine the full impact of the guidelines on survival.

Introduction Some clinical diagnoses such as sepsis, renal failure, metastatic cancer, house-bound lifestyle, and stroke are associated with worse prognosis after inhospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) [1][2][3]. But there are a few reports about chronic liver disease, Asian people, and the incidence of IHCA is rarely reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hospital mortality of adult patients who had experienced IHCA by underlying disease and the incidence of IHCA. Methods Between March and October 2008, 69 patients who experienced IHCA were prospectively enrolled in the study. There were 64,345 total admissions to the hospital in this period. Patients who had cardiac arrests in the ICU, emergency room, and operating room were excluded from this study. The hospital mortality compared group A (chronic liver disease, 10 patients and cancer, 24 patients) with group B (chronic lung disease and heart failure, chronic renal disease and diabetes mellitus). Results The incidence of IHCA was 1.07 events per 1,000 hospital admissions. Of the 69 enrolled patients, 34 were assigned to group A and 35 to group B. The mean patient age of group B was higher than group A (66.7 vs. 56.5 years, P = 0.003). There was no difference of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) more than 20 minutes between the two groups (group A, 53% vs. group B, 63%, P = 0.40). The hospital mortalities of underlying disease were presented: chronic liver disease (90%), cancer (88%), chronic lung disease (20%), and heart failure (54%). The hospital mortality was higher in group A than in group B (88.2% vs. 45.7%, P <0.001). The hospital mortality was higher during the night compared with during the day (80% vs. 50%, P = 0.01) and ROSC was higher during the day than during the night (80% vs. 41%, P = 0.001).

Conclusions In this study, the chronic liver disease and cancer group had poor prognosis compared with the other underlying diseases such as chronic lung disease or heart failure.

Introduction Cerebral performance of survivors from cardiopulmonary arrest is usually based on the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral performance categories (GP-CPC), and favorable neurological outcome are GP-CPC 1 (good cerebral performance) and GP-CPC 2 (moderate cerebral disability). Especially, CPC 1 is called full recovery. However, do the patients categorized as GP-CPC 1 work as they did before? We evaluated higher brain function among patients who were classed GP-CPC 1 and analyzed the factors influencing it. Results Among 15 eligible patients, eight cases with nonhigher brain dysfunction and seven cases with higher brain dysfunction were analyzed. In patients with nonhigher dysfunction: bystander CPR, eight cases (100%); witnessed, eight cases (100%); and DC (AED) use, eight cases (100%). In patients with higher brain dysfunction: bystander CPR, three cases (43%); witnessed, five cases (71%); and AED (DC) use, six cases (86%). Patients with nonhigher brain dysfunction were more likely to receive bystander CPR than those with higher brain dysfunction (Fisher's exact test P = 0.026).

Conclusions One-half of patients who were generally called full recovery could not work as they did before because they had higher brain dysfunction after resuscitation. It is important to analyze factors that influence the recovery to higher brain function in patients with GP-CPC 1 to improve the outcome of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation.

Introduction Two randomized clinical trials explored that induced hypothermia improved outcomes in adults with coma after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation [1,2]. In this study, we present the usefulness of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring to predict the patient's outcome after induced hypothermia. Methods Hypothermia (34°C, 48 hours) was induced in patients after the recovery of spontaneous circulation. The indication was as follows: motor response of Glasgow coma scale ≤5, at least one of the brain stem reflexes intact and age 15 to 80 years. ICP and oxygen saturation of the jugular vein (SjO 2 ) monitoring were performed during hypothermia.

Introduction Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that, in certain groups of patients, is potentially reversible if treated early enough. Outcome after cardiac arrest is mostly determined by the degree of hypoxic brain damage. Patients recovering from cardiopulmonary resuscitation are at great risk of subsequent death or severe neurological damage, including a persistent vegetative state. The early definition of prognosis for these patients has ethical and economic implications; it is estimated that the cost for the care of severely brain-damaged survivors runs into billions of dollars each year.


## Methods

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the value of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in predicting outcomes in patients early after inhospital cardiac arrest. This study was carried on 30 patients who had inhospital cardiac arrest during their admission to the critical care unit and for whom cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed according to the protocol of the European Resuscitation Guidelines, who survived for at least 12 hours after the event and for whom informed consent was obtained. We excluded patients with neoplastic diseases known to increase NSE levels (small cell lung cancer, melanoma and malignancy of the kidney and testicles, stroke (ischemic and/or hemorrhagic) or traumatic brain injury Introduction Recent investigations have revealed that the state of post-ischemic brain recirculation is of major importance in recovery from sudden death, and we developed an isolated global ischemic brain model that excludes the confounding variables of bypass, donor blood, and whole body damage to investigate the strategy of controlled reperfusion. This study examines primary damage of cerebral function and tissue with uncontrolled brain reperfusion following 30 minutes of brain ischemia, and tests whether controlled brain reperfusion can attenuate the damage. Methods Sixteen pigs underwent 30 minutes of global brain ischemia by clamping major neck vessels via a small suprasternal incision. Seven pigs then received uncontrolled reperfusion with normal blood, while the other nine pigs received controlled reperfusion by infusing a modified (leukodepleted, hypocalcemic, hyperosmolar, alkalotic, normoglycemic, antioxidant enriched) warm blood solution into both carotid arteries for 20 minutes. Six pigs underwent Sham operation. Brain oxygen uptake and venous conjugated dienes (CD) were measured during reperfusion. The neurologic deficit score (NDS) (0 = normal, 500 = brain death) was determined at 24 hours after ischemia, and brain water contents and cerebral infarction by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining were assessed post mortem. Results Sham pigs were neurologically normal at 24 hours. Uncontrolled reperfusion resulted in two early deaths with brain herniation, multiple seizures, low brain oxygen uptake*, high CD levels (1.64 ± 0.03 A 233 nm )*, and high NDS (244 ± 19 in survivors)* indicating marked functional neurologic impairment. Postmortem analysis showed marked brain edema (84.3 ± 0.6%)* and extensive brain infarcts*. In contrast, pigs receiving controlled reperfusion had high brain oxygen uptake, low CD levels (1.3 ± 0.07 A 233 nm ), no post seizures, and low NDS (41 ± 11), with all pigs being able to sit and eat, and three showing complete recovery. Brain edema was reduced (81.8 ± 0.5%), and 2,3,5-Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1

Conclusions Our novel ischemic brain model provides an effective tool to study brain ischemia. More importantly, these data indicate that controlled reperfusion attenuates reperfusion injury in the brain as it has been applied in other organs, and introduces the potential of using controlled reperfusion as a new treatment for sudden death and stoke.

Effectiveness of an underbody forced warm-air blanket in preventing postoperative hypothermia after coronary artery bypass graft surgery with normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass Introduction Mild induced hypothermia (MIH) has become a standard of care in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) [1,2]. Even though the initial randomised trails excluded victims with noncoronary causes of OHCA, MIH may still be useful to attenuate ischemic brain damage in this group of patients.  Introduction Despite cardiac arrests accounting for 5.8% of admissions to intensive care, there is significant variation in the management and outcome of these patients in different units [1]. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that active cooling to 32 to 34°C for 12 to 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) significantly improves the outcome of patients who have an out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation arrest [2]. However there are a range of cooling techniques employed, and no trials have demonstrated that any particular system is superior [3]. Introduction Diagnosis of brain death is very important. Confirmatory tests have been used to corroborate brain death, but they are expensive, nonattainable in all ICUs and in some instances have no correlation with clinical tests [1]. The Cerebral State Index (CSI) (Danmeter, Odense, Denmark) is a portable apparatus that has been made for determination of the depth of anesthesia based on brain waves determination and analysis [2]. Methods This is a study on 65 head-injured patients and 72 alert head-injured patients. Eighteen to 24 hours after confirmation of brain death by clinical tests applied by a neurologist, the CSI was recorded according to the company's instruction. The CSI was recorded if the electromyography was zero on the screen and the quality index was above 70%. Results If the CSI score was ≤3 for detection of brain death and the CSI score was ≥3 for detection of nonbrain-dead patients, the CSI can detect 100% of cases with brain death from nonbraindead patients. Furthermore, if burst suppression (BS%) >75% is for detection of brain death and BS% between 0% and 75% is for detection of nonbrain-dead patients, the CSI could detect 100% brain-dead patients from nonbrain-dead patients.


## Methods

Conclusions MRI, CT and electroencephalography are time consuming and expensive, and require specialized people. In a previous study the Bispectral index scale (BIS) had been used for confirmation of brain death [3], but was not successful because the range of EEG filtration of BIS is wider than that of CSI and the calculation methods are different; moreover they did not consider BS% in addition to BIS. In the present study all of the clinically diagnosed brain-dead patients had CSI = 3 and BS% = 75%, and all of the clinically no-brain-death patients had CSI ≥3 and BS% ≤75. So the sensitivity and specificity of CSI for detection of brain death is 100%.


## Introduction

Cushing's triad of bradycardia, hypertension and abnormal breathing due to critically raised intracranial pressure was described in 1903 [1] and is generally accepted clinically. We recognised that our patients undergoing uncal herniation and brain stem compression (whilst intubated and ventilated) did not appear to exhibit this classic response.

Methods We identified suitable patients from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Wardwatcher audit database for our ICU admissions from August 1999 to February 2007. We used the search terms subarachnoid haemorrhage and traumatic brain injury both linked to brain stem death testing. From the resultant 175 patients, a consecutive sample of 50 patients was chosen for chart review. There were 30 males, mean age 40.5 years, and 20 females, mean age 50 years. Diagnoses were subarachnoid haemorrhage n = 27, stroke n = 6, traumatic brain injury n = 5, subdural haematoma n = 3, intracerebral haemorrhage n = 6, other n = 3. The time of coning was identified by the development of fixed dilated pupils and loss of cough reflex. Haemodynamics were recorded 1 hour before coning occurred, at the time of coning and 1 hour later. In 43 ventilated patients a hypertensive surge was documented. One other patient underwent the blood pressure surge breathing spontaneously and was not intubated. In six patients the haemodynamic surge had not been documented by the bedside nurse. It was evident from chart review that coning had occurred in the hour between haemodynamic recordings. Results In 44 patients there was a significant rise in blood pressure at the time of confirmation of uncal herniation with a subsequent fall. This was accompanied by a major tachycardia in 38 patients and a normal heart rate in five patients. Only one patient exhibited a bradycardia and had been extubated as part of withdrawal of therapy.

Conclusions We have demonstrated that the haemodynamic response to critically raised intracranial pressure in a ventilated patient is not a bradycardia. We have used an approach akin to that of Cushing but all of the six patients in Cushing's original paper were breathing spontaneously. All but one of our patients was ventilated. We suggest that by avoiding hypoxaemia and hypercapnic acidosis the cardiac response is altered. It is important for clinicians to be aware of this to aid recognition of coning for diagnostic and prognostic reasons. Introduction Endotracheal suctioning (ETS) is a routine nursing procedure used to decrease pulmonary complications; however, in severe head-injured patients it can result in a sudden increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and may put the patient at risk for further cerebral damage [1][2][3]. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ETS on ICP in severe head-injured patients. Methods Twenty-one patients with acute severe head injury (Glasgow coma score ≤8, range 4 to 8) were studied. Each subject received four passes of insertion of a standardized suction catheter and application of negative pressure limited to 10 to 15 seconds in each procedure of suctioning. The  Introduction We have previously shown that a significant proportion of patients have increased numbers of lymphocytes proliferating in response to myelin basic protein 10 days post traumatic brain injury (TBI); associated with a trend for more favourable outcome [1]. This suggests that the adaptive immune response may have a protective role following TBI, as demon-strated in animal models [2]. In this study, we further explored this process by examining the effect of TBI on regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers, and determining whether a change in Treg frequency was long lived. Methods We recruited 12 patients with severe or moderate TBI who required protocol-driven therapy to maintain cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure. Blood samples were taken within 72 hours and 10 days post TBI. A separate group of patients was studied 6 months post TBI. Age-matched and sexmatched healthy volunteers were used as controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. Flow cytometry was used to identify Tregs according to the surface expression of markers (CD4/CD25 high /CD45RO high /CD127 low ).

Results When compared with controls, patients at 10 days and at 6 months post TBI showed a greater proportion of PBMCs with a Treg phenotype (Mann-Whitney U test; P <0.01 and P <0.05, respectively). The proportion of Treg cells at 72 hours was higher than controls, but this difference did not reach significance. See Figure 1. Introduction It is very hard to achieve optimal water balance in severe head injury (SHI) patients (Glasgow coma score ≤8). Cardiopulmonary complications are common after SHI: neurogenic pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and so on [1][2][3][4]. In this study we present the alteration of cardiopulmonary function on pulse contour Conclusions Persistent catecholamine release and the different sensitivity of blood vessels to catecholamine cause the blood volume redistribution: systemic hypovolemia and hydrostatic pulmonary edema. The excess cardiac preload due to catecholamine release leads to brain natriuretic peptide release resulting in natriuresis.


## Introduction

The RESCUEicp study (Randomised Evaluation of Surgery with Craniectomy for Uncontrollable Elevation of Intracranial Pressure) aims to provide Class 1 randomised evidence as to whether decompressive craniectomy is effective for the management of patients with raised and refractory intracranial pressure (ICP) following traumatic brain injury. Methods An international multicentre randomised trial comparing decompressive craniectomy with medical management. Patients (n = 50 for the pilot phase, n = 600 for the main study) with traumatic brain injury and raised ICP (>25 mmHg) refractory to initial treatment measures are eligible for the study. Patients are randomised to one of two arms: continuation of optimal medical management (including barbiturates) versus surgery (decompressive craniectomy). The inclusion criteria are: traumatic brain injury, age 10 to 65 years, abnormal CT scan and the exclusion criteria: bilateral fixed and dilated pupils, bleeding diathesis, devastating injury not expected to survive 24 hours. Outcome is assessed using the extended Glasgow Outcome Score and the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. See Figure 1.

Introduction Bedside measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) is a promising technology to detect vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [1]. The Bowman ® rCBF monitor facilitates continuous and quantitative assessment of brain tissue perfusion in ml/100 g tissue/minute with a thermodiffusion microprobe. The probe is self-calibrating at user-definable time intervals from 1 to 120 minutes. To estimate the necessary recalibration frequency, we looked at the measurement drift between two calibration points. Methods In 32 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, a Bowman ® rCBF probe was implanted in the vascular territory of the aneurysm-harboring vessel. According to previous experience, we performed automatic recalibration of the rCBF device every 30 minutes, thus yielding measurement periods of 25 minutes. CBF was recorded once per second. Data were averaged over 1 minute and all measurement cycles were pooled.


## Results

The mean analyzed monitoring time per patient was 6.9 days. The mean rCBF was 24.4 ml/100 g/min at the beginning and 25.6 ml/100 g/min at the end of the measurement cycles between two recalibration periods, thus representing a mean drift of 1.15 ml/100 g/min per 25-minute measurement period (P <0.001). This drift was heterogeneous in different patients (range -3.67 to 12.0 ml/100 g/min). Patients number 24 to 32 who were monitored more recently showed a significant upward drift of 7.57 ml/100 g/min, whereas data from patients number 1 to 23 had a downward drift of -0.67 ml/100 g/min. Explanation for this phenomenon is a revision of the monitor software by the manufacturer that was performed after patient 23. This finding was verified with external data. Conclusions The current implementation of the Bowman ® rCBF monitor shows a severe upward measurement drift that is clinically relevant. At present, the only solution is to perform recalibrations as frequently as possible. Reference 1.

## Introduction

The objective is to study the relationship between end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2 ) and cerebrovascular pressure reactivity in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cerebrovascular pressure reactivity is the ability of cerebral vessels to respond to changes in transmural pressure. A cerebrovascular pressure reactivity index (PRx) can be determined as the moving correlation coefficient between the mean intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial blood pressure. A negative or zero value reflects a normally reactive vascular bed whereas positive values reflect passive, nonreactive vessels. This index correlates significantly with outcome after TBI [1]. Carbon dioxide affects the cerebral vascular response. Our aim is to identify the optimal EtCO 2 , at which PRx reaches its lowest value. Methods A prospective observational study of 20 patients with TBI at the Royal London Hospital. All patients were managed according to the local guidelines for the management of TBI. PRx was determined by ICM+ (Cambridge University) software by calculating the correlation coefficient between ICP and arterial blood pressure. A total of 965 hours of data were recorded including the mean arterial pressure, ICP, cerebral parfusion pressure, PRx and EtCO 2 .

Results We plotted EtCO 2 against PRx to identify the optimal EtCO 2 and the range of carbon dioxide reactivity. The graph of PRx compared with EtCO 2 indicated a U-shaped curve, suggesting that too low or too high ETCO 2 was associated with a disturbance in pressure reactivity ( Figure 1). We found this pattern in 66% of the patients. In the other patients (34%) there was no such correlation, so it was not possible to identify optimal EtCO 2 , probably indicating loss of carbon dioxide reactivity.  Introduction Current prognostic information following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is of limited clinical utility. We hypothesized that wide practice variation exists in determining prognosis in this population. We conducted a survey of Canadian intensivists to better understand prognosis determination and decisions regarding level of care following severe TBI. Methods Survey items were generated to assess the perceived utilization and utility of different tests for prognosis determination, and the perception of prognosis and decision on the level of care. We used direct questions and scenario-based questions (fivepoint Likert scales). We pretested the questionnaire to assess its clinical sensibility, and conducted test-retest reliability. Canadian intensivists were identified at all level I and level II trauma centers. The survey was administered electronically. Nonrespondents were sent a paper questionnaire.

Severe brain trauma management analysis using a highrate recording tool: better definition allows better analysis of practice Introduction Review of practice is a way to enhance quality of care. We developed a high-rate recording tool able to store the data of critical care patients [1]. We recorded 15 severely braininjured patients and analyzed our team's practice according to commonly admitted recommendations. Methods Fifteen patients were recorded at a rate of one value each 2 seconds during a total of 750 hours. We analyzed the data to identify 5-minute or longer episodes of cerebral hypoperfusion (CHP) and intracranial hypertension (ICHT). The episodes were electronically detected among the signal files and manually validated using software allowing signal graph visualization and scrolling.

Results Two hundred and forty-one episodes were detected: 135 episodes of ICHT and 106 episodes of CHP. ICHT and CHP episodes were grouped in 84 cases (34%). CHP episodes were shorter than ICHT episodes (P <0.02). Medical reactions were observed in 128 cases (53%) and more often concerned episodes lasting more than 30 minutes (n = 88, 59%) than shorter episodes (n = 61, 41%). Electronic analysis of CHP showed that overall reactions are made to increase the mean arterial pressure (47%) rather than to lower intracranial pressure (35%). Adequacy of medical decisions for mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure management was, respectively, 45% and 55% considering recommendations made for severe head trauma management.

The brain is a major source of S100 increase in porcine endotoxemic shock Introduction Cerebral dysfunction frequently complicates septic shock. A marker of cerebral dysfunction could be of significant value in managing sedated septic patients. Plasma S100 (S100B) proteins increase in sepsis. S100B is present in the brain, but also in other tissues. To date, the source of this protein has not been investigated in sepsis. The aim of this study is to determine whether the brain is the source of S100B in an experimental sepsis model.


## Methods

Twenty-seven pigs were anesthetized and randomized to either infusion of endotoxin at the rate of 1 μg/kg/hour (n = 19) or saline (n = 8). Catheters were inserted into a cervical artery and the superior sagittal sinus. Blood samples were collected from both sites and physiological data were registered before the start of the endotoxin infusion and hourly. After 6 hours, the animals were terminated and brain tissue samples were taken from the left hemisphere. S100B in plasma was measured by ELISA. Brain tissue samples were stained with biotinylated S100B antibodies. Results S100B levels increased in plasma and expression of S100B in cerebral tissue was higher in endotoxemic animals compared with controls. Statistically higher sinus versus arterial S100B concentration was only found at 2 hours in the endotoxemic animals ( Figure 1). Conclusions Although other sources exist, the brain is a major source of S100B in endotoxemia, making it a potential marker of cerebral dysfunction in septic shock.

Introduction After severe brain injury, anemia can adversely affect cerebral oxygen delivery and brain tissue oxygen (PbtO 2 ). However, it is unclear whether low hemoglobin (Hb) contributes to brain tissue hypoxia or compromises oxidative metabolism. Methods We studied 28 consecutive patients with severe brain injury (15 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 8 with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 5 with traumatic brain injury) who underwent multimodality intracranial pressure, PbtO 2 and microdialysis monitoring. The relationship between Hb levels and the risk of brain tissue hypoxia (BTH), defined as PbtO 2 ≤15 mmHg, and metabolic crisis (MC), defined as lactate/pyruvate ratio ≥40 and glucose <0.7 mmol/l, was analyzed with general linear models of logistic function for dichotomized outcomes utilizing generalized estimating equations for model estimation.

The mean age was 53 (20 to 83) years, 18 (64%) patients were female, median Glasgow coma scale was 6 (IQR 4 to 8) and 32% were dead at discharge.

For every reduction in Hb range below the reference, there was an increased risk of MC (adjOR = 1.7 (95% CI = 1 to 2.9), P = 0.048 for 1 to 9 mg/dl; and adjOR = 4.2 (1.6 to 11.4), P <0.01 for ≤8 mg/dl) ( Figure 1). A reduction in Hb below 8 mg/dl was also associated with increased risk of BTH (adjOR = 2.5 (1 to 6.5), P = 0.04) ( Figure 2). The number of hours per day monitored spent in MC, but not with BTH, was associated with mortality at discharge (adjOR = 1.6 (1.1 to 2.4), P = 0.02).

Conclusions Mild reductions in blood Hb below 9 mg/dl are associated with an increased risk of MC and BTH after severe brain injury. MC had a more pronounced relationship with anemia and was associated with a greater risk of death.

Introduction Nonconvulsive seizures (NCSZ) and periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) are common and associated with poor outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our objective is to describe the frequency of renal, liver, metabolic and thrombotic dysfunction after ICH and its association with nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), NCSZ and PEDs. Introduction Central nervous system (CNS) failure along with other systems is included in septic multiorgan failure; however, in our opinion, it is the less studied. Earlier, a S100β level rise was described for septic encephalopathy patients, but together with this sites of a local ischemia or a bleed were discovered according to computer tomography in a brain [1]. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether it is the functional or the organic CNS insult that defines septic encephalopathy and to study the dependence of septic encephalopathy on the severity of sepsis. Methods The prospective study involves 28 septic patients according to sepsis criteria and ACCP/SCCM classifications. The primary site localization of infection in our study excluded the CNS according to computer tomography. After the approval of the hospital ethics committee we investigated the patients without neurological disturbances. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group (n = 12) included the patients with various degrees of impairment of consciousness (<15 points of the Glasgow coma scale). The second group (n = 16) included patients without any disturbances of consciousness. There were no differences between groups in age, gender, severity of sepsis, the cortisone level, lactate, and arterial and jugular bulb blood saturation.


## Results

The S100β level in group 1 was reliably higher than in group 2, and on average it surpassed the normal rate by 2.6 times (group 2 showed the S100β level as not exceeding the normal level of 0.15 units/ml). Venous blood saturation in the two groups reliably did not differ and was within the norm. However, the saturation of the jugularis blood in group 1 was equal to 57.64 ± 13.3, which is below the norm. Venous blood lactate exceeded in group 2, while group 1 showed a normal rate both in venous and jugular blood (lactate jugular = 1.76). The 28-day mortality was reliably higher in group 1. The S100β level correlated with mortality.

Plasma catecholamine and natriuretic peptide concentrations after SAH. NOR, noradrenalin; DOA, dopamine. Introduction Vasospasm is the main cause of death and cognitive deficits in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage after rupture of an aneurysm (aSAH). Some trials have shown that statins in the acute phase of aSAH reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of cerebral vasospasm [1]. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of simvastatin (SVT) as prevention against vasospasm. Methods We realized a prospective, randomized, nonblind study with the use of 80 mg SVT (night) in the first 72 hours of the beginning of bleeding, and a control group that did not use SVT, for 21 days between January and December 2008. Informed consent was obtained for all patients. CT scans were performed as a control and another CT scan was performed in patients with altered neurological signals. In the presence of changes suggestive of vasospasm or correlation in clinical conditions and CT scans, the patients were taken for a cerebral arteriography examination followed by an angioplasty procedure if necessary. Liver and renal function and LDL cholesterol were evaluated weekly, and total creatine kinase was evaluated every 3 days. Exclusion criteria: liver and renal disease, pregnant elevation of serum transaminases (three times normal value), creatinine ≥2.5, rhabdomyolysis or total creatine kinase ≥1,000 U/l.


## Results

We excluded two patients with bleeding for more than 72 hours. There was no significant change in the levels of total creatine kinase, and renal or liver function. We included 21 patients, 11 in the SVT group and 10 in the control group. Mortality was eight patients (38%), six patients in the control group and two of the SVT group. Vasospasm was confirmed by cerebral arteriography examination in four patients in the control group and one patient in the SVT group. All the patients who died showed Fisher scale IV. Conclusions SVT at a dose of 80 mg was effective in reducing the mortality (18.1% against 60%) compared with the group that did not use SVT, and also decreased the incidence of cerebral vasospasm despite the APACHE II score being higher in the group that used SVT (14.3 vs. 10.7). Less morbidity occurred in the SVT group, with an average Glasgow outcome score of 3.25 vs. 2.

Magnesium use on prophylaxis of vasospasm morbidity and the mortality rate in subarachnoid hemorrhage Introduction We propose this study in order to reach two points: the clinical incidence of vasospasm morbidity, confirmed by CT; and the mortality of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients in 28 days [1]. It shows the comparison of a group of patients that used magnesium (Mg) (intervention, Group 1) with those that did not use Mg (control, Group 2

those who survive about 40% to 50% develop significant neurological deficits [1]. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as pneumonia occurring more than 48 hours after initiation of mechanical ventilation. About 20% of post-aneurysmal SAH patients are reported to experience VAP [2]. In this trial, we aimed to report the short-term outcomes of VAP. We performed a surveillance analysis on aneurysmal SAH patients who required mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Review of the literature gives a wide variation in outcome between 3.2% and 42%. It is our hypothesis that a combination of more aggressive critical care management combined with early intervention should result in a reevaluation of treatment plans in those with a historically perceived poor outcome.


## Methods


## Introduction

The most widely adopted scale to assess consciousness in severely brain-damaged patients is the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) [1]. Its major shortcomings are the failure to assess the verbal component in intubated patients, the inability to test brainstem reflexes and breathing patterns. In 2005, Wijdicks and colleagues proposed a new coma scale, the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) scale [2], which consists of four components (eye, motor, brainstem, and respiration), each component having a maximal score of 4. Our objective was to validate the French version of the new FOUR coma scale in a general ICU and to assess its predictive value as compared with the GCS. Methods We performed FOUR and GCS evaluations in randomized order in 176 acutely brain-injured patients (days from insult to randomization <1 month). We assessed the association between GCS and FOUR scores using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and etiology of coma was performed to assess the link between the studied scores and the outcome based on the Glasgow outcome scales 3 months after injury (n = 63). Results Forty-one patients (21 in group 1 and 20 in group 2) were enrolled. The mean age was 37 ± 9 years, with a masculine predominance (75.4%). The mean length of hospitalization was 32 days. The length of hospitalization of group 1 was less than that of group 2 (P = 0.02). The weaning of MV was more precocious in the patients of group 1 than those of group 2 (P = 0.01). Also, the beginning of motility recuperation was more precocious in group 1 than in group 2 (P = 0.001).


## Results

Conclusions Although the results of the literature are not conclusive, our work -of which the most important slant is the absence of randomization -reveals that there is a meaningful difference for MV weaning between the group receiving IVIg in relation to the PE group. These encouraging results would merit confirmation by controlled and randomized works.

Introduction Neuromuscular weakness is a condition which is often found during long-term ICU treatment. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the main reason for neuromuscular weakness.

Diagnosis of CIP is difficult in the ICU setting. The  Introduction Muscle weakness and atrophy due to critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPM) is common in long-stay intensive care patients. Recent nerve excitability studies suggest that the recovery cycle after a single supramaximal stimulus provides useful information about axonal membrane potential and ion channel function in neuropathies. We previously found that critical illness polyneuropathy is associated with nerve depolarization, and that this depolarization is strongly correlated with serum potassium in patients with renal failure [1]. We have adapted this method to human muscle fibres, by measuring the changes in conduction velocity of muscle fibres [2]. The muscle relative refractory period (RRP) increases and supernormality (SN) decreases in ischaemia, suggesting that these measures may be indicators of membrane potential also in the muscle [2]. The aim of this study was to evaluate muscle RRP and SN in patients with CIPM. Methods Nine patients (age 44 to 73 years) with electrophysiologically proven CIPM were studied on two occasions within 1 week. Multifibre responses to direct muscle stimulation through needle electrodes were recorded from the brachioradialis, and the latency changes measured as conditioning stimuli were applied at interstimulus intervals of 2 to 1,000 ms. RRP and SN were compared with an age-matched control group.


## Results

In patients with CIPM, muscle RRP was abnormally prolonged (6.25 ± 2.74 ms (mean ± SD) vs. 3.27 ± 0.45 ms in healthy subjects; P = 0.0015) and supernormality was reduced (3.6 ± 3.1% vs. 9.3 ± 3.4%; P = 0.013). Moreover, during renal failure (8/18 measurements), muscle supernormality correlated strongly with serum potassium (R = 0.95, P = 0.0004).

Conclusions Muscle fibres are depolarized in CIPM. If, as we have previously suggested, nerve membrane depolarization is an important cause of neuropathy in critical illness, it seems likely that muscle membrane depolarization may be an important cause of myopathy. Serum potassium is an important factor for muscle membrane depolarization in patients with renal failure. 


## Introduction

The use of intensive insulin therapy (IIT) in neurocritical care patients is controversial: IIT failed to improve mortality and morbidity in brain-injury patients in a number of trials. Hypoglycemia increases the risk of death and may contribute to the development of secondary brain injury in these patients. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Hypoglycaemia, a common complication of strict glucose control in critically ill patients, has controversial effects on mortality. The hyperglycaemic index (HGI) takes into account the unequal time distribution of blood glucose sampling and is a better predictor of death than other methods to quantify hyperglycaemia [1]. By analogy with the HGI, we defined the hypoglycaemic index (HGI-60) as the area above the glucose curve and lower than 60 mg/dl divided by the length of ICU stay. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of hypoglycaemia on inhospital mortality in critical care patients using a new method for quantification of hypoglycaemia, the hypoglycaemic index (HGI-60 Introduction Endocrine disturbances during critical illness lead to a feeding-resistant wasting syndrome, characterised by profound protein breakdown, promoting delayed recovery and poor outcome. Parenteral nutrition failed to counteract the hypercatabolic state, possibly due to aggravation of the detrimental hyperglycemic response to critical illness. In our rabbit model of prolonged critical illness we investigated the impact of varying intravenous glucose load, while maintaining normoglycemia, on mortality, organ damage, and catabolism/anabolism. Methods Critically ill rabbits were randomised into a fasting group, a standard parenteral nutrition group, and two groups receiving either an intermediate or high additional amount of intravenous glucose within the physiological range, all maintained normoglycemic with insulin. These normoglycemic groups were compared with a hyperglycemic group (similar high glucose load as the last normoglycemic group) and with healthy rabbits. Protein and lipid load was equal for all fed groups. Results Varying intravenous glucose load did not affect the mortality or organ damage, provided normoglycemia was maintained. Fasted critically ill rabbits lost weight, which was attenuated by increasing intravenous glucose load. As compared with healthy rabbits, mRNA expression of several components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was elevated in skeletal muscle of fasted critically ill rabbits, which was counteracted by intravenous feeding. Except in the normoglycemic group with intermediate glucose load, circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 and thyroid hormone levels decreased in all groups, most pronounced in hyperglycemic rabbits. Conclusions Provided normoglycemia is maintained, increasing intravenous glucose within the physiological range is safe for organ function and survival of critically ill rabbits and reduces catabolism compared with fasting.

## Reduction of glucose and insulin concentrations during in vitro incubation of whole blood

Introduction Incubation of whole blood has been used in numerous in vitro investigations. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that glucose and insulin concentrations declined during incubation. Methods Six young, healthy and fasting males donated blood. Aliquots containing heparin-anticoagulated whole blood were added to with different quantities of insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and bacterial endotoxin (Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide serotype 026:B6; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA). Aliquots were incubated for 6 hours at 37°C in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO 2 and 95% air. Concentrations of blood glucose were measured every hour, whereas insulin was measured at baseline and 6 hours. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare medians.


## Results

The glucose concentration in aliquots to which insulin 30 nmol/l and lipopolysaccharide 1,000 ng/ml were added decreased linearly and approached zero after 6 hours (median 0.6 vs. 4.75 mmol/l, P = 0.027; presented as a line chart of medians with range in Figure 1). The insulin content in blood samples without any additions was reduced by more than 50% during incubation (median 22.5 vs. 48.0 pmol/l, P = 0.028; depicted as box plots with median lines, 25th to 75th percentile boxes and 10th to 90th percentile error bars in Figure 1). Similar glucose and insulin measurements were performed during incubation of other selected aliquots. The reductions of glucose and insulin content were analogous to the results above; the magnitude of reduction seemed to be independent of the addition of insulin and/or lipopolysaccharide.

## Conclusions

The concentration of glucose was reduced to almost zero during 6 hours of incubation; the decline was probably due to glycolysis in blood cells rather than the effects of insulin. The resulting hypoglycaemia may affect cellular functions, and addition of glucose should therefore be performed during in vitro incubations. The decline in insulin content was unexpected, as insulin is mostly degraded in the liver and kidney, but to some extent also in blood cells and extracellularly.

Surprising result after evaluating a nurse-driven guideline on blood glucose management 


## Introduction

To implement a tight glycemic control protocol in the ICU, it is essential to obtain active nurse involvement [1,2]. Our objective was to evaluate nurses' perceptions about three different blood glucose control protocols for critically ill patients. Methods As part of a randomized control trial comparing three blood glucose control protocols in ICU patients, we issued a questionnaire to all nurses who participated in the study to evaluate their perception on protocol efficacy, benefits, safety, risks, feasibility and a question asking which protocol the nurses would like to be adopted in their ICU. The randomized control trial arms were: a computer-assisted insulin protocol (CAIP) with continuous insulin infusion to maintain blood glucose between 100 and 130 mg/dl; a Leuven protocol with insulin infusion to maintain blood glucose between 80 and 110 mg/dl; and conventional treatment with subcutaneous insulin if glucose >150 mg/dl. Results Sixty nurses answered the questionnaires. The CAIP was considered the most efficient by 57% of the nurses. About 58% of the nurses evaluated its performance as good or very good, compared with 22% for the Leuven protocol (P <0.001) and 40% for conventional treatment (P = 0.08). The CAIP was considered easier to use than the Leuven protocol (P <0.001) and as easy as conventional treatment (P = 0.78). Fifty-six percent of the nurses chose the CAIP as the protocol they would like to be adopted in their institution.


## Conclusions

The CAIP was more efficacious, safer and easier to use than the Leuven protocol. Compared with conventional treatment, the feasibility and safety of the CAIP were considered similar. Most nurses chose the CAIP as the protocol they would like to be adopted in their ICU.

Introduction Tight glycemic control (TGC) in the ICU is difficult, and is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia [1]. We use a nurse-wise insulin titration protocol for TGC in our ICU. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a simple computer alert on the quality of TGC. Methods An alert was created with the EventManager ® of MetaVision ® . The nurses received a pop-up message on the bedside workstation, with a simple suggestion for the timing of the next measurement and a nonspecific instruction to check caloric intake and insulin dose, at the following blood glucose (BG) thresholds: BG >180 mg/dl, >110 mg/dl, <80 mg/dl, <60 mg/dl. When BG was <40 mg/dl, an alert was sent to all workstations, and to both doctors and nurses. The alert was implemented on 1 August 2007. We performed an observational cohort study, including all adults (>18 years) who were in our ICU between 31 January and 31 July 2007 (control group, n = 731), and between 31 August 2007 and 6 February 2008 (alert group, n = 654). StatView ® was used for statistical analysis.


## Results

The mean BG per patient, the glycemic penalty index (GPI) [2] and the hyperglycaemic index (HGI) [3] were significantly lower after implementation of the alert. There were fewer patients in the alert group who experienced at least one episode of BG Introduction This study was performed to determine the effect variables supposed to affect optimal blood glucose concentrations between 80 and 150 mg/dl in postoperative/post-traumatic patients. Methods From January 2007 to December 2007, 826 postoperative/post-traumatic critically ill patients admitted to a university adult ICU performing intensive insulin therapy were surveyed daily using computer assistance with respect to minimal and maximal daily blood glucose concentrations and insulin therapy. The variables age, sex, sepsis, neurosurgical patient, steroids, adrenaline and/or noradrenaline infusion rate, acute renal failure, liver function assessed by the Model of Endstage Liver Disease score [1], organ dysfunctions reflected by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score [2], and severity of disease by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II [3] were monitored. Results Seven hundred and sixty-four patients with an ICU stay >48 hours were eligible for evaluation. In multiple logistic regression with backward elimination to determine the most relevant parameters, sepsis (OR = 1.2, with corresponding 95% CI = 1.1 to 1.4), neurosurgical patients (OR = 1.6, CI = 1.3 to 1.9), steroids (OR = 1.5, CI = 1.2 to 1.9), noradrenaline infusion (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.6), and age (per year) (OR = 1.02, CI = 1.01 to 1.02) were associated with an increased risk not to lay within an optimal blood glucose range of 80 to 150 mg/dl (P <0.01).

Conclusions Sepsis, neurosurgery, steroids, catecholamine infusions and age may be associated with increased risk for difficult blood glucose control in postoperative/post-traumatic patients.


## Introduction

In critical illness, hyperglycemia is a frequent complication resulting from metabolic and hormonal changes. Recent findings suggest increased glycemic variability may confer a strong independent risk of mortality in the critically ill [1]. Conventional measurements of glucose control include morning glucose, mean daily glucose, percentage of glucose readings in the goal range, and the hyperglycemic index (HGI) [2]. The objective of this study was to determine the most appropriate method for assessing glycemic control in cardiovascular (CV) surgery patients. Results Compared with placebo, GLP-1 decreased peak glucose concentrations (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l vs. 12.7 ± 1.1 mmol/l; P = 0.01) and markedly attenuated the overall glycaemic response to enteral nutrition (blood glucose area under the curve 30 to 270 min, 2,077 ± 145 mmol/l/240 min vs. 2,568 ± 208 mmol/l/240 min; P <0.02) ( Figure 1). GLP-1 caused a transient, but nonsustained, suppression of plasma glucagon concentrations (t = 30 min, 90 ± 12 pmol/ml vs. 104 ± 10 pmol/ml; P <0.01) and tended to increase the plasma insulin/blood glucose ratio (between t = 0 and 270 min, mean Δinsulin/glucose ratio 5.0 ± 2.0 mU/mmol vs. 2.5 ± 0.9 mU/mmol; P = 0.12).

Conclusions Acute, exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill. Exogenous GLP-1 represents a potentially novel therapy for the management of hyperglycaemia in the critically ill.

Introduction Recent recommendations on tight glucose control in general critically ill patients questioned its effect on patient outcome [1,2]. The aim of our work is to determine whether the implementation of tight glucose control to our practice improved our patients' outcome.

Methods In this retrospective cohort study we used baseline data from our intensive care register. An intravenous insulin protocol to maintain tight glucose control was implemented in our practice on 6 June 2003. In the study we enrolled patients admitted to our sixbed multidisciplinary ICU over a 2-year period before (years 2001 and 2002 -group with usual glucose control) and a 2-year period after (years 2004 and 2005 -group with tight glucose control) the introduction of tight glucose control. In total 231 adult mechanically ventilated patients, admitted primarily or within the first 24 hours to our ICU, were included. We recorded the length of ICU stay, length of artificial ventilation, cost, APACHE II and SOFA scores, and examined the incidence of nosocomial infections and mortality in both groups of critically ill patients.


## Results

One hundred and fifteen patients in the group with usual glucose control and 116 patients in the group with tight glucose control were analyzed; no significant difference on severity of disease in both groups (APACHE II score 23.7 vs. 24.14, P = 0.765 and SOFA score 7.9 vs. 7.8, P = 0.743) was detected. Tight glucose control was associated with a significant reduction of nosocomial pneumonia (20% vs. 11%, OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.86). There was no significant difference in hospital mortality, length of stay, artificial ventilation and cost. Conclusions Tight glucose control was associated with a significant reduction of nosocomial pneumonia, but not with a reduction of hospital mortality, length of stay, artificial ventilation and hospital cost. Introduction Critically ill infants and children often develop hyperglycaemia. In adults it is associated with worsened outcome.

No studies have so far investigated the feasibility and outcome of a standardized insulin/glucose protocol in children with congenital heart disease after cardiac surgery. Methods We prospectively studied children with congenital heart disease after cardiac surgery, for glucose intake, concomitant blood glucose values and results of insulin treatment. Results are expressed as the median and range, P <0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results Eighty-nine children were evaluated (male 56.2%), age 0.9 years (1 day to 17.9 years), length of ICU stay 22 hours (2.5 to 28.0 hours). All children survived. Fifty children were treated with and 39 without insulin. Overall, first blood glucose on admission to the ICU was 5.7 mmol/l (3.1 to 21.6 mmol/l), after 6 hours was 8.2 mmol/l (4.7 to 23.0 mmol/l), highest blood glucose was 9.9 mmol/l (3.4 to 23.7 mmol/l), and 77.5% was hyperglycaemic during admission (>8.0 mmol/l). Fifty out of the 70 children with hyperglycaemia were treated with insulin. Time to reach normoglycaemia in insulin-treated children was 6.4 hours (0.3 to 17.2 hours), total length of insulin treatment was 11.9 hours (2.3 to 23.0 hours) and the length of hyperglycaemia was 6.7 hours (1.2 to 17.0 hours) ( Table 1). The duration of hyperglycaemia of treated and untreated children was not significantly different. Hypoglycaemia (<4.0 mmol/l) occurred in 10 children (11.2%); none of them had severe hypoglycaemia (<2.2 mmol/l). Conclusions This study shows that a majority (77.5%) of children admitted after cardiac surgery develops hyperglycaemia and 72.5% were treated with insulin. The duration of hyperglycaemia was not different between children with or without insulin treatment. It can be questioned whether beneficial effects of insulin therapy can be expected with the short duration of insulin treatment (11.9 hours), which was noticed in this study.

Introduction Fifty years' worth of published evidence has inferred benefits of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusion to critically ill patients. We sought to measure the treatment effect of GIK infusion on mortality in critically ill patients.


## Methods

We conducted a systematic review of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, conference proceedings, clinical practice guidelines, and other sources using a comprehensive strategy. We identified randomized controlled trials comparing GIK treatment with standard care or placebo in critically ill adult patients. The primary outcome variable was mortality. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standardized instruments; consensus was reached by conference. Preplanned subgroup analysis included studies of high-quality methodology, septic shock or other circulatory shock populations. We used the chi-square test and the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity (I 2 ) to assess for statistical heterogeneity (P <0.10, I 2 >25%). The primary analysis was based on the random effects model to produce pooled ORs with 95% CIs.


## Results

The search yielded 1,720 potential publications; 23 studies were included in the final analysis, providing a sample of 22,525 patients. Included studies only contained populations of acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular surgery patients.

The combined results demonstrate no statistically significant heterogeneity (P = 0.57, I 2 = 0%) and no effect on mortality (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.11) with GIK treatment. Among the highquality studies (n = 4) there was no effect on mortality (OR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.95 to 1.14). No experimental studies of shock or sepsis populations were identified. Conclusions This meta-analysis found that there is no mortality benefit to GIK infusion in critically ill patients; however, study populations were limited to acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular surgery patients. No studies were identified utilizing GIK in patients with septic shock or other forms of circulatory shock, providing an absence of evidence regarding the effect of GIK as a therapy in patients with shock. Introduction Major surgery carries a significant risk of postoperative infections, such as surgical site infections. An estimated 500,000 surgical site infections occur annually at a cost of more the $1 billion/year in the US alone. Surgical trauma leads to an initial excessive inflammatory response, together with an almost immediate and dramatic depression of cell-mediated immunity. This immnosuppression may be due to a significant decrease in plasma arginine levels observed following surgery. This arginine deficiency can severely impair T-cell proliferation and key T-cell receptor function. Perioperative arginine administration can prevent arginine deficiency and restore cellular immunity. The purpose of this metaanalysis was to examine the relationship between immunemodulating enteral nutrition therapy (IMENT) containing arginine and infectious complications, length of stay, and mortality rates in surgical patients. Methods All prospective randomized controlled trials of argininecontaining IMENT versus standard enteral nutrition in surgical patients conducted from 1990 to 2008 were identified from multiple databases. Studies included in the analysis evaluated infectious complication, length of stay, and/or mortality rates. Methodological quality of individual studies was scored and necessary data were abstracted in duplicate and independently. Results Thirty randomized trials with a total of 2,789 patients compared the use of arginine-containing IMENT with standard enteral nutrition in surgical patients. Arginine-containing IMENT significantly decreased infectious complications (relative risk = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.69, P <0.00001) and overall length of stay (weighted mean difference = -2.09, 95% CI = -3.20 to -0.97, P = 0.0002) versus standard enteral nutrition. As expected in a low-mortality surgical population, however, no effect was observed on mortality (relative risk = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.80, P = 0.84).


## P130 Incidence and risk factors of hypertriglyceridemia in the ICU


## Conclusions

The cumulative results show that arginine-containing IMENT significantly reduces overall infections and length of stay in surgical patients. Based on this evidence, arginine-containing IMENT could soon become the standard of care in the surgical patient. This large treatment effect demands definitive evaluation in a large multicenter trial.

Introduction Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an inhibitor of the arginine-NO pathway. ADMA accumulates when degradation in the liver by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase is impaired. In theory, plasma citrulline, formed when arginine is converted by NO synthase, and when ADMA is metabolized, would be lowered and ornithine, formed by the degradation of arginine in the urea cycle, would be potentially elevated when ADMA accumulates as in sepsis and in liver failure [1]. Methods Fourteen male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or hemihepatectomy (HH). Plasma levels of arginine, ADMA, citrulline and ornithine were measured before and 120 minutes after 5 mg/kg LPS and HH, respectively. Results See Table 1.

Conclusions Plasma levels of arginine and derivatives should not be interpreted as a reflection of metabolism at the tissue level. In HH, the elevated ADMA levels suggest dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase activity depends on the liver tissue mass. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Delayed gastric emptying is one of the major reasons for enteral feeding intolerance in ICU patients [1][2][3]. We studied the effect of ginger supplementation to the diet on development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in ICU patients [2]. Methods In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled fashion, 32 ARDS mechanically ventilated patients who were fed entrally were studied. Patients were randomized into two groups; one group had ginger added and the other had placebo added to their enteral feeding. The amount of feeding tolerated in the first 48 hours, the amount of feeding tolerated during the entire study period, development of VAP, the number of ICU-free days, the number of ventilator-free days and morality were evaluated. Results Enteral feeding tolerated in the first 48 hours of study was significantly higher in patients with the ginger-supplemented diet (51% vs. 57%, P <0.005). However this was not different during the entire study period (92% vs. 93%, P = 0.42). VAP was seen in 6.3% of the patients in the ginger group and in 31.3% of the control group, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.08 


## Introduction

We hypothesized that constitutively expressed arginase 1 (Arg-1) may be released from hepatocytes to the circulatory compartment to play the role of extinguisher at the front and to serve a protective function by modulating inflammation. We used a cell culture model of epithelial barrier dysfunction to determine whether liver cytosolic proteins could decrease NO • production and preserve enterocyte paracellular barrier function on that basis. Methods We exposed immunostimulated Caco 2BBe enterocytelike cells to human liver cytosol (LC). Cytomix (IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-1β) was used to stimulate the cells. Arginase activity in cell supernatants and murine serum was measured by following the generation of citrulline and urea from arginase. Tissue lysates and conditioned media were untreated or treated with the enzyme inhibitors (S)-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine-HCl (BEC) and L-N(6)-(1iminoethyl) lysine (L-NIL), which inhibit arginases and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), respectively. Results Cytomix increased paracellular permeability, and induced the expression of iNOS and release of NO • . LC protein (400 μg/ml) applied to the basal but not apical compartment preserved barrier function and completely blocked the release of NO • but only slightly decreased the magnitude of iNOS protein expression in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation demonstrated that microsomal Arg-1 prepared from LC decreased iNOS-dependent NO • production. BEC and anti-Arg-1 antibody inhibited the NO • blocking ability of LC. Surprisingly, LC arginase activity required activation by a cell-derived factor and its release could be blocked by treating cells with L-NIL. Increased consumption of arginase by activated LC Arg-1 led to decreased iNOS dimerization, which decreased NO • production. In the serum from endotoxemic mice, arginase activity was significantly increased. Furthermore, iNOS existed in ileal mucosa predominantly in the inactive monomeric form at 18 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection, consistent with decreased iNOS activity in the absence of arginase.

Conclusions Arg-1 is one such liver-derived protein that increases in serum during endotoxemia and other inflammatory states. Modulation of mucosal iNOS activity following activation of circulating Arg-1 may be protective because it would be expected to decrease epithelial barrier dysfunction as a result of decreased NO • production.

Role of parenteral glutamine supplementation on patient outcome in the surgical ICU Introduction Multiple organ failure (MOF) is a frequent cause of death in the critically ill patient. The gut could be the cornerstone of MOF, the first step being an early splanchnic ischemia, inducing the loss of barrier function, systemic infections and MOF [1]. Plasma citrulline (normal 20 to 60 μmol/l) reflects a small bowel mass and is decreased in various small bowel diseases [2]. The objectives of the study were to study plasma citrulline kinetics and their prognostic value in adults hospitalized in the ICU. Methods A prospective monocentric observational study, including adults consecutively admitted to the ICU without small bowel disease, and without chronic renal failure. We studied at onset, hour 12, hour 24, day 2, and day 7 of plasma citrulline, and clinical, biological, prognostic and therapeutic parameters. The univariate analysis of plasma citrulline (0 to 10 μmol/l, 11 to 20 μmol/l, and >20 μmol/l) with other variables and multivariate analysis.

Results Sixty-seven patients were included, mean age 60 years, organ dysfunctions and/or infections model ODIN score of 2.4, IGS2 score (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) of 50, and a 28day mortality of 34%. During the first day, mean plasma citrulline decreased from 18.8 to 13.5 μmol/l, and it decreased more in nonsurvivors than in survivors among patients without acute renal failure (37% vs. 18%). A lower plasma citrulline at hour 24 was associated with higher plasma C-reactive protein, nosocomial infection rate, and 28-day mortality (P = 0.006, P = 0.03 and P = 0.03). A lower plasma citrulline at day 2 was associated with a higher use of catecholamines, and a lower use of enteral feeding (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, plasma citrulline at hour 24 and ODIN score at admission ≥3 were associated with 28-day mortality (P = 0.04 and P = 0.04).

Conclusions A lower plasma citrulline at hour 24 was associated with higher plasma C-reactive protein, nosocomial infection rate, and 28-day mortality. A lower plasma citrulline at day 2 was associated with a higher use of catecholamines, and a lower use of enteral feeding. Such results could reflect the systemic consequences of acute intestinal failure in patients hospitalized in the ICU. Introduction Within the frame of postoperative total parenteral nutrition, a frequent consequence due to postaggression metabolism is an inhibition of lipoprotein lipase leading to hypertriglyceridemia [1]. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the administration of a fish-oil-containing lipid emulsion (SMOF) compared with a lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil led to a better utilisation of the lipids. Methods A prospective randomised study. After approval of the ethical committee, 44 postoperative surgical patients with an indication for parenteral nutrition therapy were included in the study. Nonprotein calories were given as 60% glucose and 40% lipid emulsion. The total energy intake per day was 25 kcal/kg body weight. The sedation regimen was standardised (midazolam and fentanyl), propofol (a lipid emulsion) was avoided. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 22) received SMOF (SMOFlipid ® 20%), and group B (n = 22) received an emulsion based on olive and soybean oil (ClinOleic20%). Lipid emulsions were administered for 5 days continuously. Trigylceride (TG) levels were measured before the start of infusion (d0), at day 1 (d1), day 2 (d2), and day 5 (d5) after the start of infusion. A pathological TG level was defined at 300 mg/dl and the significance level at P <0.05. Results There were no significant differences in TG levels at baseline (d0: group A: 119 ± 35 vs. group B: 120 ± 45 mg /dl; P = 0.87), whereas at d2 (group A: 151 ± 52 vs. group B: 202 ± 108 mg/dl; P < 0.03) and at d5 (group A: 163 ± 72 vs. group B: 233 ± 94 mg/dl; P < 0.01) the TG levels in the SMOF group were significant lower than in the control group. At d5 the incidence of pathological TG levels was significant lower in patients receiving SMOF (0%) compared with the control group (31.8%).


## Conclusions

The administration of a fish-oil-containing lipid emulsion within a parenteral nutrition regimen led at d2 and d5 of the nutrition regimen to significantly reduced TG levels compared with a lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil, indicating a better utilisation of the administered TGs.  Introduction Erythromycin is the most potent prokinetic drug available. It is commonly used intravenously. The aim of our study was to determine the effective lowest dose of enteral erythromycin, its tolerability and comparing the dose with the severity of the disease and outcome. Methods All patients admitted to the trauma ICU between January 2004 and January 2008 who developed feeding intolerance were included (residual volume >500/24 hours). The starting dose was 125 mg erythromycin twice daily; if no response, the dose was increased up to a maximum of 1 g twice daily. Data were entered in SPSS software. The chi-square test + one-way ANOVA with post hoc analysis were used. P <0.05 was significant. Results One hundred and seven patients were included, with 85% being male, average age 41 ± 18 years. The majority of patients (54%) suffered from traumatic brain injury, 74% were ventilated, 51% on inotropes, 55% on three opioids, 84% on enteral feeding. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was significantly higher and the Glasgow coma scale was significantly lower in patients receiving 1g erythromycin (P <0.05). See Table 1.

Conclusions A low dose of enteral erythromycin 125 mg twice daily is potentially effective in patients on intravenous metoclopromide having enteral feeding intolerance. Combining prokinetic therapy and keeping the administration of erythromycin as short as possible can prevent the development of bacterial resistance.

Feeding enterally the hemodynamically unstable critically ill patient: experience from a multicentre trial (the REDOXS © study) Introduction The delivery of adequate enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients with shock is problematic. The purpose of this study is to describe how EN is delivered in patients with shock from the REDOXS © study, a multicentre, randomized controlled trial of pharmaconutrition. Methods In 20 centres in Canada and Europe, we randomized mechanically ventilated adults with two or more organ failures to one of four groups: (1) glutamine, (2) antioxidants, (3) glutamine plus antioxidants, (4) placebo. EN and parenteral nutrition were initiated and maintained independently as per the Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines. Shock was defined as the presence of hypoperfusion requiring vasopressors for at least 2 hours. Daily data including the timing of EN, volumes received, incidence of high gastric residual volumes (hGRVs), use and timing of motility agents and small bowel feeding were collected. Results From May 2007 to July 2008, 159 patients with shock were randomized, 122 (77%) received EN only, and 13 (8%) patients received EN in combination with parenteral nutrition. EN was started 20.2 hours (median, range 0 to 204.8 hours) after ICU admission. The mean duration of EN was 9.2 days (median 6.8, range 0.1 to 30 days) and the mean volume of EN received was 67% (range 2.5 to 199%) of that prescribed. In total 73/135 (55%) had hGRVs >250 ml, and in these patients motility agents and small bowel feeding were used in 78.1% and 41.1% of patients, respectively. Motility agents were started before onset of hGRVs in 21% patients, on the same day as hGRVs in 40% S60 patients and on average 1.6 ± 0.9 days after hGRVs in 39% patients. The percentage mean prescribed volume of EN received 24 hours before and after the start of motility agents was 35.1% vs. 55.9% (P = 0.009). Small bowel feeding was started before onset of hGRVs in 20% patients, on the same day as hGRVs in 14% patients and was started on average 4.7 ± 3.5 (mean, SD) days after hGRVs in 67% patients. The percentage mean prescribed volume of EN received 24 hours before and after the start of small bowel feeding was 54.2% vs. 67.3% (P = 0.36).

Conclusions In critically ill patients with shock, EN can be provided in the early phases of acute illness to the majority of patients. The delivery of EN in this population can be maximized by better adoption of motility agents and small bowel feeding.  ). It was a retrospective study. All data were recorded before (T0) and at the end of MARS treatment (T). Results Among 16 fulminant hepatic failure patients, we observed a significant decrease of encephalopathy (P = 0.04). On the other hand we did not observe significant improvement of hemodynamic parameters (norepinephrine dose, mean arterial pressure), metabolic parameters (pH, lactate) or hepatic tests (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time, factor V). In this subgroup, hospital mortality is 31% at day 28. In the group treated for acute on chronic liver failure, the results did not show a difference between grade of encephalopathy before and after the session. We only observed a trend of improvement in hemodynamic and biologic parameters but this was not statistically significant except for cholestase parameters (γ-glutamyltransferase P = 0.022, bilirubin P = 0.002). Hospital mortality is 71% at day 28. Among the patients with hepatorenal syndrome, 62.5% were anuric. We observed a significant increase of diuresis output (P <0.01). We did not observe any significant adverse event.


## P145

Conclusions Our results confirmed that nonbiologic hepatic support by MARS was safe. The results were disappointing above all in cirrhosis patients. Nevertheless, results in hepatorenal syndrome were encouraging. Introduction A considerable body of evidence indicates the contribution of the immune system to the mechanisms leading to acute pancreatitis [1]. Data focusing on the early course of events at the clinical ground of the process are lacking. The aim of the present study was to provide a complex evaluation of peripheral blood monocyte and subpopulations of lymphocytes in patients with acute pancreatitis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

## Comparison of two indwelling bowel catheters on economic impact by number of bedding and dressing changes per day

Methods Forty-three patients were enrolled in the study; 33 with acute pancreatitis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and 10 healthy subjects. Peripheral blood immune cells were studied on days 1 and 4 by flow cytometry. Results Percentages of natural killer (NK) cells and of apoptosis of CD4 lymphocytes upon diagnosis are presented in Table 1.

Changes of NK cells and of monocyte apoptosis are presented in Table 2. Introduction Selenium is one of the most investigated trace elements and an important link in the antioxidant system [1]. It is known that selenium levels are lower than normal at the time of admittance to the ICU in critically ill patients [2]. Several cohort surveys highlight the role of selenium deficiency in the carcinogenesis of oesophageal cancer [3]. Mortality and morbidity data after oesophagectomy may vary, but remain considerably high [4]. Methods In three Hungarian university centres, 36 patients who were operated on with oesophageal cancer (OG-group) and admitted to the ICU, and 96 healthy volunteers (C-group) were recruited. In the OG-group, full blood selenium levels were measured preoperatively (t0) and on the first (t1) and second (t2) postoperative days. Selenium levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry in the laboratories of Byosin Arzneimittel GmbH (Fellbach, Germany), blinded to patient's condition or group assignment. All data are presented as the mean ± SD. Conclusions This study has shown significantly lower selenium levels in OG-patients as compared with controls and a significant decrease in the postoperative period. Whether this has any influence on outcome requires further investigation.

Introduction Selenium (Se) and selenocysteine residues are essential for the activity of glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GPX). GPX plays an important role in antioxidant defense. Se deficiency is reported in critically ill patients due to deficient dietetic intake, unsupplemented parenteral nutrition, catabolic state and increased losses. The objective of the study was to study the Se and GPX status in critically ill children with cardiac dysfunction and the effects of Se supplementation. Methods Thirty-five critically ill cardiac children (mean age: 2.82 ± 3.41 years) with different cardiac disorders (15 with myocarditis, 15 with cardiomyopathy and five with rheumatic heart disease) were investigated for blood Se and GPX levels and echocardiographic parameters at admission and after 3 days of parenteral Se supplementation (initial dose of 2 μg/kg/day on the first day followed by 1 μg/kg/day). Fifteen healthy children were included as controls.

Results At admission, Se and GPX levels were significantly decreased in patients (6.61 ± 1.16 μg/l and 10.8 ± 1.14 U/l) compared with controls (16.06 ± 2.08 μg/l and 20.64 ± 2.13 U/l) (P <0.001). Se levels did not differ between studied cardiac diseases (P >0.05). Se levels correlated positively with corresponding ejection fraction values (EF) (r = 0.57 and P <0.05) and fractional shortening values (FS) (r = 0.45 and P <0.05), and negatively with left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (r = -0.50 and P <0.05). After Se supplementation, Se and GPX were raised (16.53 ± 2.25 μg/l and 19.71 ± 2.63 U/l). Clinical examination revealed that orthopnea improved in 88.6% of cases and dysrhythmia disappeared in 65.7%. Echocardiography showed that EF and FS were also significantly improved (admission values for EF and FS were 34.6 ± 7.4 and 16.8 ± 4.1, compared with 52.6 ± 11.4 and 27.7 ± 6.8 after Se supplementation; P <0.05).

Conclusions Se deficiency is one of the mechanisms of worsening cardiac dysfunction in critically ill patients regardless of the underlying cardiac etiology. Se supplementation can reverse such a mechanism and improve cardiac performance.

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction High doses of selenium (Se) may improve the condition of ICU patients with respect to its involvement in antioxidative protection and other tasks. In the previous work we concluded, that the decrease of 28-day mortality is not significant. Now procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), as markers of the severity of actual status, were monitored and evaluated in relation to the plasma Se concentration. Methods One hundred and forty patients were randomized into groups A and B. Group A received standard Se substitution: 30 to 75 μg/day NaSelenite intravenously; group B received Se substitution according to a protocol: 1,000 μg at day 1, followed with 500 μg at days 2 to 14. These groups were divided into four subgroups: systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. Plasma levels of Se, CRP and PCT were examined. SOFA and 28-day mortality were evaluated as clinical markers. Relations between parameters were evaluated statistically. In both groups, transitions among subgroups during treatment were evaluated. All patients monitored less than three times were excluded. Results Negative correlations between Se x PCT, Se x SOFA and Se x CRP were found (Table 1). Correlation coefficients (r) were statistically significantly higher in group B. Evaluation of transitions among subgroups during treatment showed there was a difference in subgroup septic shock between groups A and B. Into the less severe stage of sepsis moved 28% in group A (14 examinations) and 44% (16 examinations) in group B. 


## Conclusions

There were more significant negative correlations between plasmatic Se and parameters of inflammation in the group of patients supplemented with high doses of Se. In accordance was a finding of more frequent transition from septic shock to a less severe stage of sepsis. Even if a decrease of mortality was again not found, the presented results may perhaps indicate a positive metabolic influence in critical illness. Introduction Mathematical models are widely used to simulate physiological processes in the human body and can be exploited for diagnostic purpose or the automation of therapeutic measures [1]. Usually these models focus on one single aspect of the human physiology. Complex models with interaction between different physiological processes usually do not consist of interchangeable submodels. We therefore designed a versatile software based on Matlab with dynamically exchangeable subsystems within the three model families of respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and cardiovascular dynamics. Methods For each submodel the parameters have been extracted from the corresponding literature. Common interfaces were defined for each model family based on these parameters to ensure interchangeability within the same model family. For simulation of human body gas exchange we used a two-compartment model with oxygen and carbon dioxide dissociation curves. The model family of cardiovascular dynamics consisted of a singlecompartment model and a six-compartment model including the response to pleural pressure. The respiratory mechanics were based on a first-order resistance-compliance model and a secondorder resistance-compliance model. Model parameters were fit to human test data or to data taken from the literature. Simulation is executed using a dedicated caller program to combine the selected submodels and to execute them subsequently at each time step. Submodel selection and basic parameter specification can be done via a graphical user interface. The software was tested with different model combinations. Each combination was supplied with alterations in ventilation frequency and positive endexpiratory pressure.

Results Simulation based on parameters from the literature with the variations described above showed plausible results. Alterations in ventilation frequency indicated a response time consistent with data acquired by Jensen and colleagues [2]. Conclusions The developed software is able to simulate different combinations of submodels at variable complexity. Simulation results are consistent with experimental data. Interaction between submodels can be seen in the simulation output.

Introduction Application of the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) for patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock is undoubted. But the time of IABC initiation is questionable. The goal of the study was to evaluate the influence of the IABP initiation time and dose of dopamine for patient hemodynamic data and inhospital mortality. Methods Sixty-two consecutive acute myocardial infarction patients managed with IABP were included in the study. The initiation time of IABP and administered dopamine doses were compared. Two subgroups of patients were separated: those receiving less than 10 μg/kg/minute dopamine, and others receiving 10 μg/kg/minute dopamine or more. Standard hemodynamic indices of cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), stroke index (SI), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAmean), cardiac power (CP = CO x MAP / 451, where MAP is mean arterial pressure) and cardiac power index (CPI = CI x MAP / 451) were measured.

Results CO in the first group was 3.58 ± 1.12 l/minute, in comparison with 2.54 ± 1.08 l/minute (P <0.0001) in the second group. CI correspondingly was 1.9 ± 0.6 l/minute/m 2 and 1.38 ± 0.61 l/minute/m 2 (P = 0.001), SV was 43.8 ± 26.14 ml and 30.01 ± 13.75 ml (P = 0.012), SI was 23.93 ± 15.58 ml/m 2 and 16.28 ± 7.75 ml/m 2 (P = 0.017), CP was 0.68 ± 0.25 W and 0.4 ± 0.23 W (P <0.0001), CPI was 0.36 ± 0.14 W/m 2 and 0.22 ± 0.13 W/m 2 (P <0.0001), PCWP was 21.32 ± 6.04 mmHg and 24.16 ± 7.42 mmHg (P = 0,104), PAmean was 28.74 ± 8.53 mmHg and 30.23 ± 7.05 mmHg (P = 0.47). In the second subgroup, hemodynamic indices (CO, CI, SV, SI, CP and CPI) were statistically significantly lower (P <0.05) in comparison with the data of patients receiving less than 10 μg/kg/minute, while PCWP and CVP values differed insignificantly. Inhospital mortality was higher among patients receiving 10 μg/kg/minute dopamine or more. Among 31 patients receiving less than 10 μg/kg/minute dopamine 16 (51.6%) died, while among those 31 receiving 10 μg/kg/minute or more 27 (87.1%) died. This was a significant difference according to the Pearson χ 2 criterion (χ 2 = 9.182, P = 0.002).

Conclusions Initiation of aortic counterpulsation should be considered as soon as possible, while the patient with acute myocardial infarction is treated with low doses of vasopressors. Results Compared with male patients, female patients were older (P <0.01); The morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and the rate of physical labors were significantly higher in female patients (P <0.01, P <0.01, P <0.01); the morbidity of hyperlipemia and the rate of mental labors and positive family history were significantly lower in female patients (P <0.01, P <0.01, P <0.05). In the <55 years group, the morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and the rate of physical labors were significantly higher in female patients (P <0.05, P <0.01, P <0.01); the rate of mental labors were significantly lower in female patients (P <0.01). In the 55 to 64 years group, the morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and the rate of physical labors were significantly higher in female patients (P <0.01, P <0.05, P <0.01); the rate of mental labors was significantly lower in female patients (P <0.01). In the 65 to 74 years group, the morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and the rate of physical labors were significantly higher in female patients (P <0.05, P <0.01, P <0.01); the rate of mental labors was significantly lower in female patients (P <0.01). In the ≥75 years group, the rate of physical labors was significantly higher in female patients (P <0.01); the rate of mental labors was significantly lower in female patients (P <0.01).

## Study of risk factors for female patients with acute myocardial infarction

Conclusions Compared with male patients, female patients with AMI were older, and type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension probably played more important roles in female patients. A higher rate of physical labors and a lower rate of mental labors in female patients probably contribute to prevent them from AMI.

Influence of arterial pressure on tissue perfusion in septic shock 


## Introduction

The aim of this study was to measure the effects of increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) on systemic oxygen metabolism and regional tissue perfusion in septic shock. Methods Twenty patients with the diagnosis of septic shock who required pressor agents to maintain a MAP ≥65 mmHg after fluid resuscitation to a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) ≥12 mmHg were included. Norepinephrine was titrated to MAPs of 65 mmHg, 75 mmHg and 85 mmHg in 20 patients with septic shock.

Results At each level of MAP, hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, PAOP, cardiac index, left ventricular stroke work index, and systemic vascular resistance index), metabolic parameters (oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, blood lactate), and regional perfusion parameters (gastric mucosal PCO 2 , skin capillary blood flow and red blood cell velocity, urine output) were measured. Increasing the MAP from 65 to 85 mmHg with norepinephrine resulted in increases in cardiac index from 3.5 ± 0.4 l/min/m 2 to 5.0 ± 0.5 l/min/m 2 (P < 0.03). Blood lactate was 3.5 ± 0.8 mEq/l at a MAP of 65 mmHg and 3.0 ± 0.8 mEq/l at 85 mmHg (P = NS). The gradient between arterial PCO 2 and gastric intramucosal PCO 2 was 11 ± 3 mmHg (1.5 ± 0.3 kPa) at a MAP of 65 mmHg and 15 ± 3 mmHg at 85 mmHg (2.0 ± 0.3 kPa, P = NS). Urine output at 65 mmHg was 40 ± 10 ml/hour and was 45 ± 12 ml/hour at 85 mmHg (P = NS). As the MAP was raised, there were no significant changes in skin capillary blood flow or red blood cell velocity.

Conclusions Increasing the MAP from 65 mmHg to 85 mmHg with norepinephrine does not significantly affect systemic oxygen metabolism, skin microcirculatory blood flow, urine output, or splanchnic perfusion.

heart. The aim of the present study was to address the issue of applying the technique of left ventricular (LV) pacing to that substrate of heart failure patients with a narrow rather than wide QRS complex, and with LV rather than biventricular pacing in order to permit the use of an ordinary dual-chamber pacemaker.

Methods We conducted an acute study on 20 patients (15 male, five female; mean age 43 years); all had CHF (12 ischemic and eight idiopathic) with normal QRS duration on ECG. All patients were under maximal tolerated doses of antifailure treatment. All patients were subjected to M-mode and two-2D echocardiography to measure: left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), fractional shortening (FS), ejection fraction (EF), mitral regurge area and cardiac output before and 15 minutes after LV pacing. All patients were subjected to temporary dual-chamber right atrium, LV pacing; the LV lead was passed retrogradely via the transaortic route. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was measured using a trilumen, balloon-tipped thermodilution Swan-Ganz catheter. Patients were divided into group I (PCWP >15 mmHg, 10 patients) and group II (PCWP <15 mmHg, 10 patients).

Results Echocardiographic measurements after pacing in group I showed significantly lower LVEDD (5.12 vs. 6.53 cm, P <0.004), lower LVESD (4.01 vs. 4.65 cm, P <0.034), smaller mitral regurge area (9.7 vs. 13.4 cm 2 , P <0.005), higher FS (18.9 vs. 17, P <0.04) and higher EF (37.9 vs. 35.5%, P <0.02). In contrast, following pacing in group II, the hemodynamics were not significantly different from pre-pacing values. Conclusions Single LV -rather than biventricular -pacing could achieve remarkable hemodynamic beneficial effects in patients with CHF even with normal QRS, but only in that substrate of patients with a high PCWP. Although this is an acute study, our findings open the scope for widespread application of the concept of multisite pacing.


## P156 Left ventricular pacing alone improves haemodynamic variables D Rgab

Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P156 (doi: 10.1186/cc7320) Introduction Despite advances in drug treatment, congestive heart failure (CHF) remains a major healthcare problem associated with a poor quality of life and a high mortality rate. During the past decade, cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) using biventricular (BIV) pacing emerged as a promising technique improving the quality of life, exercise tolerance and mortality in patients with severe CHF. Left univentricular (LV) pacing is able to achieve the same mechanical synchronisation as BIV pacing in experimental studies and in humans resulting in significant improvement in functional class, quality of life and exercise tolerance at the same extent as those observed with BIV stimulation. The aim was to study the acute hemodynamic effects of LV pacing in the category of patients with severe CHF and QRS duration <130 ms and to determine whether pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) >15 mmHg could have an impact on these changes in hemodynamics.

Methods We conducted an acute study on 20 patients (15 male, five female; mean age 43 years); all had CHF (12 ischemic and eight idiopathic) with a QRS duration <130 ms. All patients had an ejection fraction <40%. Group I comprised 10 patients with PCWP >15 mmHg, group II comprised 10 patients with PCWP <15 mmHg. Haemodynamics were measured using a Swan-Ganz catheter at baseline and during LV VDD pacing. All patients were under maximal tolerated doses of antifailure treatment.

Results After LV pacing, group I showed a significant decrease in right atrial pressure (P = 0.001), and PCWP also significantly decreased (P = 0.0001), while the cardiac output ignificantly increased (P = 0.04). In group II none of these hemodynamic parameters showed any significant improvement. The improvement of hemodynamics in group I occurred despite the greater increase in QRS duration after LV pacing when compared with group II (24 vs. 21%, respectively).

Conclusions LV pacing acutely benefits CHF patients with PCWP >15 mmHg irrespective of the QRS duration. Although this is an acute study, our findings open the scope for revising the current wide QRS duration as an indication for CRT and to consider the less expensive LV rather than BIV pacing when a patient is considered a candidate for resynchronization.

Introduction Postoperative atrial fibrillation is one of the most frequent complications after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between preoperative left atrial dysfunction assessed by tissue Doppler and postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG an involvement of the apex of the right ventricle (RV) has been recognized affecting approximately one-quarter of cases.

Methods TS was diagnosed in 10 patients (nine female, one male; mean age 67 years) who displayed typical signs of acute myocardial ischemia, showed typical ECG changes and slightly elevated troponin I (0.8 ng/ml; n ± 3.5 ng/ml; normal <0.3 ng/ml). Echocardiography was obtained on admission in all patients. TS was presumed by identification of the typical LV apical ballooning configuration (echo positive). In 10 patients left heart catheterization was then performed immediately. Results All patients displayed LV apical ballooning on LV angiography without coronary artery lesions. Nine patients were echo positive (90%; sensitivity 91%, specificity 100%); in the one echonegative patient the LV angiogram showed only a very small apical ballooning area. In all of the nine patients classified as echo positive, involvement of the RV apex was identified as well.

Additional hypokinesia of the middle part of the RV was seen in two patients; however, the basal RV wall segments were never compromised. One patient showed dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction.

Conclusions RV involvement was a common feature in TS, involving 90% of patients. In all cases, the apical portion of the RV was compromised, the basal segments were never affected. In most patients the typical wall motion disturbance was readily seen on transthoracic echocardiogram. RV involvement was identified in all echo-positive patients. Probably, identification of RV apical ballooning may aid in differentiating TS from MI. Introduction Bradycardia is described as a side effect of α 2sympothomimetic infusion. It is supposed as a dose-dependent phenomenon. Cholinergic antagonists or β-sympathomimetics are recommended for the bradycardia correction. We propose that the severity of bradycardia associated with α 2 -sympothomimetic infusion depends on the level of hypothyroidism. The aim of this report is to provide evidence for our point of view. Methods Fifteen patients after sellar region tumor surgery were included in the study. Resistant arterial hypotension developed in the early postoperative period in all patients and they were monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter for this reason. The hormonal profile (triiodothyronine, thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and cortisol) was investigated daily during the whole period of hemodynamic monitoring.


## Results

The cause of resistant arterial hypotension in all cases was decreased vascular tone (systemic vascular resistance index = 1,503 ± 624 dyn·s·cm 5 ·m 2 ), and so phenylephrine as the α 2sympothomimetic was the drug of choice. Administration of phenylephrine started with the mean dose of 2.9 μg/kg/minute, and the maximal mean dose during the period of arterial hypotension was 5 μg/kg/minute. Bradycardia developed in four patients during infusion of phenylephrine. All these patients had clinical signs of hypothyroidism (hypothermia, dynamic ileus, etc.) and decreased levels of T3, T4, free T3 and free T4. In order to correct bradycardia, the infusion of phenylephrine was combined with cholinergic antagonists and β-sympathomimetics. Simultaneously, dose administration of thyroid hormones was increased.

Heart rates reached the normal range, when clinical signs of hypothyroidism were corrected, and the level of thyroid hormones tended to rise. In 11 patients without clinical signs of hypothyroidism and normal levels of thyroid hormones in plasma, bradycardia never developed even if they received high doses of phenylephrine (5.5 μg/kg/min).

Conclusions Bradycardia, associated with α 2 -sympothomimetic infusion, is a consequence of hypothyroidism in patients after sellar region tumor surgery. This phenomenon is not dose dependent. Patients with bradycardia, developed after beginning α 2 -sympothomimetic infusion, need to be screened for hypothyroidism. If hypothyroidism is confirmed, therapy with L-thyroxin should be administrated immediately. In patients having received thyroid hormones, their doses need to be increased. Introduction Epicardial accelerometers have proved to detect myocardial ischemia with high sensitivity [1]. In this combined experimental and clinical study using an epicardial accelerometer, we aimed to test two methods for real-time automated detection of myocardial ischemia. Methods One accelerometer (5 x 5 x 2 mm 3 ) was sutured in the perfusion area of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Epicardial acceleration was simultaneously recorded with ECG, and the ECG QRS complex was automatically detected for timing of systole. From the epicardial acceleration, signal circumferential peak velocity and displacement was automatically calculated within a time interval of 150 ms after peak R on the ECG. Experimental model: in 10 open-chest pigs, regional left ventricular function was reduced by temporary LAD occlusion and global myocardial function changed by esmolol infusion. The myocardial circumferential strain measured by echocardiography was used to confirm ischemia. Clinical model: the accelerometer methods were tested in seven patients, receiving coronary artery bypass grafting. LAD was occluded for 3 minutes before grafting and the accelerometer measurements were compared for hemodynamics, ECG STsegment analysis and strain by transoesophageal echocardiography.


## P160

Results Accelerometer systolic displacement was superior to systolic velocity to detect ischemia by automated analysis. Accelerometer systolic displacement demonstrated dyskinesia during LAD occlusion in pigs (11.5 ± 2.3 to -1.2 ± 2.8 mm, P <0.01), while hypokinesia was found in patients (12.8 ± 8.1 to 3.5 ± 4.4 mm, P <0.01). Ischemia was confirmed by strain echocardiography in both models (P <0.01). No significant changes in hemodynamics and in the ECG ST segment were seen during LAD occlusion in patients. In the experimental model, esmolol infusion induced fewer changes in the automated accelerometer measurements than LAD occlusion (P < 0.01) and ischemia was detected with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 95 to 100%. Conclusions Sensitive real-time detection of myocardial ischemia was feasible by the use of automated analysis of continuous epicardial accelerometer signals. This technique may improve realtime detection of ischemia during and after cardiac surgery. Introduction Insufficient reliability and specificity of cardiac output (CO) as a widely used parameter for prognosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) outcomes led to investigations and a search for new methods and parameters. Cardiac power (CP) (a parameter proportional to the product of CO and mean arterial pressure) was introduced after studies mainly performed using the invasive intermittent thermodilution (ITD) technique. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability and specificity of the new parameter mainly by means of noninvasive techniques such as impedance cardiography (ICG). Methods CO and CP were evaluated by both ITD and ICG methods in patients with AMI, admitted within 12 hours from the onset of pain. CP was evaluated using the suggested formula: CP = CO x MAP / 451, where MAP = mean arterial pressure.

During the period of 2004 to 2008, 289 (196 men and 93 women) patients were investigated. The standard eight-electrode ICG registration was used. The optimal binning method using the minimal description length principle was used to predict outcomes after AMI: inhospital mortality, survival after 6 months and survival after 12 months.

Results CP evaluated on the first day was found as the only valuable prognostic parameter using the model entropy method in the group of patients where noninvasive evaluation of CO was used. Inhospital mortality was predicted with single cut point 0.65, sensitivity 100% and specificity 92.2%, while survival of 12 months was predicted with single cut point 0.90, sensitivity 88.9% and specificity 73.0%. Only prediction of inhospital mortality was possible in the group of patients where CO was evaluated using the ITD technique. The most significant criteria using minimized entropy model were CP evaluated on the third day (single cut point 0.79, sensitivity 84.6%, specificity 100.0%) and CO evaluated also on the third day (single cut point 4.00, sensitivity 84.6%, specificity 100.0%).

Conclusions Cardiac power is a reliable predictor for inhospital mortality and survival within the first year after acute myocardial infarction. It could be evaluated using ITD and with sufficient accuracy by means of a noninvasive method -ICG -as well.

Admission was unplanned for 36 (85.7%) parturients following emergency caesarean section. Status of the heart was severe aortic or mitral stenosis 21 (50%) cases, mitral or aortic regurgitation with heart failure 5 (11.9%) cases, mechanical prosthetic valve requiring anticoagulation 8 (19%) cases, myocardial infarction 1 (2.4%) case and peripartum cardiomyopathy 7 (16.6%) cases. The median duration of stay was 4 days (range 1 to 11 days), median Obstetrical SAPS was 19.3 (range 10 to 32) and APACHE II score was 13 (range 8 to 32). There were five (11.9%) maternal deaths, due to two cases PPCM, one cerebral death and two prothesis thrombus.


## Conclusions

The majority of the cases of parturients was unbooked for antenatal care; this leads us to acknowledge the existence of risk factors related to pregnancy. Maternal functional class is an important predictor of outcome; a high index of suspicion for cardiac diseases is essential to identify risk [1], once these patients are referred for a cardiologic opinion there is a needed for cardiologist to develop a systematic approach to their evaluation. Ideally these considerations should be commenced during prepregnancy consultations, but continued throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period [1]. Introduction Nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy. However, the relative contribution of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the influence of eNOS and iNOS on cardiac function, NO production rate and survival in the clinically relevant polymicrobial cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. Methods B6/c57 wildtype (WT) and eNOS -/mice were rendered septic by CLP or were sham operated. Immediately, the selective iNOS inhibitor 1400W (6.6 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally and subcutaneously) or carrier were applied. At 12 hours after sepsis induction, heart function was assessed by pressure-volume loops (1.4 Fr Millar catheter). NOx levels and endogenous NO production (blood plasma/heart tissue) were measured via gasphase chemiluminescence detection, high-performance liquid chromatography and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. To evaluate apoptosis and inflammation, quantitative immunochemistry was applied. iNOS expression was analyzed via RT-PCR.

Results Cardiac function was significantly impaired solely in septic WT mice with diminished left ventricular developed pressure/dPdt max (dPdt max : WT CLP = 10,981 ± 1,100 mmHg/s vs. WT sham = 13,408 ± 827 mmHg/s; P <0.01) and increased left-ventricular volumes. Inhibition of iNOS in septic WT mice resulted in ameliorated cardiovascular impairment, whereas no signs of septic cardiomyopathy were observed in septic eNOS -/-. In contrast to septic eNOS -/mice, septic WT mice developed a significant increase in NO3 -, NO 2 and bioactive NO levels. eNOS deficiency was associated with diminished apoptosis and modified inflammation. In eNOS -/mice, a decreased iNOS expression was observed compared with septic WT mice. Both genetic eNOS deficiency and pharmacologic iNOS inhibition was associated with a significant survival benefit. While eNOS -/mice survived longest, additional iNOS inhibition in the latter diminished this benefit significantly. Conclusions In this clinically relevant model of sepsis, eNOS constitutes an important factor mediating septic cardiomyopathy.

To what extent the diminished inflammation, apoptosis, NO production rate, iNOS expression and prolonged survival in eNOS -/mice contribute to the observed benefits remains to be clarified in future studies. Introduction Myocardial dysfunction observed within the context of sepsis is partially due to desensitization of the cardiac muscle to vasoactive agents. Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer and a K + -ATP channel opener, plays a significant role in the treatment of myocardial depression although its use in sepsis has not yet been established. Methods We studied 42 patients (66.1 ± 7.54 years, 24 male) who met the criteria for sepsis (infection by Gram-negative bacteria and at least two SIRS criteria) and displayed severe heart dysfunction (cardiac index (CI) ≤2.2, ejection fraction (EF) ≤35%). The APACHE II score was 21.2 ± 4.9. Patients were randomized to receive additionally to their standard treatment levosimendan (0.1 μg/kg/minute 24-hour infusion) (group A, n = 23) without loading dose or dobutamine (5 to 10 μg/kg/minute 24-hour infusion) (group B, n = 19). Noradrenaline was used to preserve the mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg. The primary goal was mortality at 7 and 30 days. Results Mortality at 7 and 30 days was 30% and 60% in group A versus 36% and 68% in group B (P = 0.05, P = 0.03, respectively). The CI and EF significantly increased in group A (ΔCI: 1.79 ± 0.16 vs. 1.4 ± 0.12, P = 0.027; ΔEF: 4.8 ± 0.2% vs. 3.5 ± 0.7%, P = 0.04), and also SvO 2 (P = 0.012) and mean arterial pressure (P = 0.035) were significantly increased. Conclusions Levosimendan compared with dobutamine improves the hemodynamic profile of septic patients with myocardial dysfunction; and while there is evidence that it reduces mortality, further studies are needed to verify this. Introduction Myocardial contractile function following cardiac surgery often requires inotropic support. Traditionally, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and catecholamines are used [1,2]. Levosimendan is a novel inotropic agent-calcium sensitizer that enhances myocardial contractility without increasing intracellular calcium and myocardial oxygen demand [3]. The aim of our study was to evaluate circulation following levosimendan infusion, to find out the efficiency of tissue oxygen supply and to evaluate other inotrope dosage rates during levosimendan infusion. Methods Thirteen patients with acute heart failure following elective cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass treated with levosimendan and other inotropes were enrolled. Haemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index), PaO 2 , SvO 2 , plasma lactate, cardiac troponin I and other inotropes rates were obtained at baseline, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours and 24 hours after the start of levosimendan infusion. Levosimendan was administered at a rate of 0.1 μg/kg/minute (no bolus) with a total 24-hour dose of 12.5 mg for each patient. Other inotropic agents used were epinephrine (range 0.03 to 0.15 μg/kg/min), norepinephrine (range 0.03 to 0.18 μg/kg/min), dobutamine (range 3.5 to 7 μg/kg/min) and corotrope (range 0.3 to 0.6 μg/kg/min). Results Thirteen patients (nine female, four male) were investigated. Forty-six per cent of patients had III to IV (New York Heart Association) stage of congestive heart failure (ejection fraction <40%). Six patients died within 24 hours and were excluded. Maximal changes occurred 24 hours after levosimendan infusion. Mean arterial pressure increased, while the mean pulmonary artery pressure and central venous pressure decreased. The cardiac index did not change considerably. Oxidative stress markers improved. Mean infusion rates of epinephrine, dobutamine and corotrope decreased, while the norepinephrine mean rate did not change. Conclusions Levosimendan improves circulation by means of its positive inotropic effect, increases mean arterial pressure, and decreases pulmonary pressure. Levosimendan could be a drug of choice in myocardial hypoxia, probably combined with right heart failure. Introduction Patients with poor left ventricular function require inotropic drug support after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The use of levosimendan in these patients is associated with a better postoperative function [1]. A recent study has attributed this phenomenon to preconditioning effects of levosimendan [2]. However, a recent study showed no benefit in starting levosimendan before CPB [3]. We hypothesized that admitting the patient to intensive care 24 hours before CPB and starting levosimendan preoperatively could reduce postoperative cardiac damage. Methods Fifty patients with an ejection fraction less than 30% scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with CPB received anesthesia with propofol, cisatracurium and sufentanil. The patients were randomly assigned to two protocols. Group A: levosimendan 0.1 μg/kg/minute started before CPB after induction + dobutamine 5 μg/kg/minute started after the release of the Aox. Group B: levosimendan 0.1 μg/kg/minute started on the ICU 24 hours before CPB + dobutamine 5 μg/kg/minute started after the release of the Aox. Data analysis: SV, dobutamine, noradrenaline time and dose, cardiac enzymes, global hemodynamic variables, ICU and hospital length of stay. Statistical significance was accepted at P 0.05. Results There was no difference in postoperative stroke volume and troponin I. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in both groups was very low. There was a significant difference in ICU length of stay but not in hospital length of stay. Conclusions In cardiac surgery patients with a low preoperative ejection fraction there is no difference in cardiac function and postoperative troponin I levels between the two different levosimendan treatment modalities. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation is low when levosimendan is used perioperatively. There is a significant reduction in the ICU length of stay, but not in the hospital length of stay.


## P166 Haemodynamic effects of levosimendan following cardiac surgery A Slezina, E Strike, M Bekers-Anchipolovskis

Introduction Levosimendan, a novel calcium sensitizer, has been shown to improve hemodynamic function in patients with acute heart failure [1]. The aim of the study was to assess the hemodynamic effects of levosimendan as a rescue medication in addition to conventional therapy in patients with low cardiac output (LCO) after cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction. Methods Forty-one patients with LCO admitted to the cardiac ICU between June 2004 and November 2008 were included in this observational hemodynamic study. Thirty-four patients were admitted after open heart surgery and seven patients for ischemic acute heart failure. Levosimendan (0.1 μg/kg/min x 24 hours, without bolus) was added to conventional inotropes and/or intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The measured parameters were: cardiac output/index, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PaoP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2 ). Baseline data were collected before levosimendan administration and the following datasets were obtained at 6, 24 and 48 hours. Length of stay (LOS) in the cardiac ICU and inhospital mortality were also registered. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD. Fisher's exact test and a nonpaired t test were used when appropriate. P <0.05 was considered significant. Results All patients were on dobutamine and epinephrine. IABP support was used in 28 (68%) of cases. The addition of levosimendan significantly improved cardiac index (from 2.27 ± 0.9 l/min/m 2 to 3.05 ± 0.9 l/min/m 2 at 6 hours (P <0.01); 2.93 ± 0.8 l/min/m 2 at 24 hours (P <0.02) and 2.93 ± 1.0 l/min/m 2 at 48 hours (P <0.05)). LVEF increased with 19.8% (from 30 ± 8% to 37 ± 9% at 48 hours (P <0.05)). SvO 2 improved significantly from 57 ± 13% to 69 ± 8% at 48 hours (P <0.01). PaoP decreased significantly only in the first 6 hours from 19 ± 5 mmHg to 15 ± 4 mmHg (P <0.05). The mean LOS in the cardiac ICU was 14 ± 13 days. Inhospital mortality was 24.4%.


## Conclusions

In our case series, addition of levosimendan following ineffective conventional therapy resulted in substantial hemodynamic improvement. These preliminary results support the use of levosimendan in patients with LCO as a rescue medication with favorable short-term effects. Introduction Microvascular resuscitation is a crucial therapeutic goal in sepsis. The current study was performed to test the hypothesis that a combination of levosimendan and inhaled nitric oxide (INO) may improve microvascular perfusion in septic shock. Methods After initial hemodynamic stabilization (mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg; mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥65%), seven patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock received intravenous levosimendan 0.2 μg/kg/minute for 24 hours. At the end of the first 24 hours of the study period, inhaled nitric oxide (35 ppm) was added for another 12 hours. Sublingual microvascular perfusion was analyzed using the sidestream dark field method. The total vessel density (mm/mm 2 ), perfused vessel density (mm/mm 2 ), De Backer score (1/mm), microcirculatory flow index of small vessels (MFIs) and microcirculatory flow index of medium vessels (MFIm) were obtained at baseline and after 24 and 36 hours. Results Levosimendan significantly (P <0.05 vs. baseline) increased perfused vessel density from 11.3 mm/mm 2 (10.7; 12.6) to 14.8 mm/mm 2 (13.7; 16.1) and MFIs from 2 (1.9; 2.2) to 3 (2.8; 3). Addition of INO further increased MFIm from 2.6 (2.5; 2.8) to 3 (3; 3). Data are presented as median (25%; 75% range). No statistically significant differences were found in any of the other investigated parameters. Conclusions The combination of Levosimendan and INO may improve microvascular perfusion in septic shock. Introduction Nonhemodynamic mechanisms of cell injury might play a role in the loss of glomerular filtration rate during sepsis [1]. We hypothesized that levosimendan may positively affect renal function by a combination of systemic and regional hemodynamic, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. We therefore performed a case-control study to investigate the effects of levosimendan on creatinine clearance in patients with septic shock. Methods Ninety-nine septic shock patients received levosimendan (0.2 μg/kg/min for 24 hours) within the first 36 hours following onset of septic shock. For each study patient, a control subject from a group of patients with septic shock of an institutional database was matched for Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, baseline creatinine concentration, delay from shock onset, age, and gender. Serum creatinine concentrations were analyzed just before the start of the 24-hour period of levosimendan infusion (baseline) and 96 hours after levosimendan had been initiated. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated by applying the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Results Compared with the control cohort, levosimendan significantly increased the glomerular filtration rate after 96 hours (62 ± 46 vs. 50 ± 33 ml/min, P < 0.05). In addition, the maximum serum creatinine concentration was lower in the levosimendan group (2.2 ± 1.3 vs. 2.6 ± 2 mg/dl, P <0.05 vs. control) during the 96-hour study period. Conclusions The present data suggest that levosimendan may improve renal function in patients with septic shock. Introduction Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer that increases cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular calcium levels. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in acute decompensated heart failure but has not been evaluated in severe sepsis/septic shock. We hypothesized that levosimendan increases the cardiac index similar to dobutamine in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Methods In a randomized, open-label trial, 42 patients admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis/septic shock were randomized to receive either levosimendan (group L) or dobutamine (group D) as part of an early-goal directed therapy protocol [1]. Study drugs were titrated incrementally to an ScvO 2 ≥70% or to a maximum dose, whichever was achieved first, and were continued for a total of 24 hours only. Group L received levosimendan 0.05 μg/kg/ minute intravenously that was increased by 0.05 μg/kg/minute every 30 minutes (maximum 0.2 μg/kg/min). Group D received dobutamine 5 μg/kg/minute intravenously which was increased by 5 μg/kg/minute every 30 minutes (maximum 20 μg/kg/min). Rescue therapy consisted of dobutamine 10 μg/kg/minute intravenously titrated to ScvO 2 ≥70% or a maximum of 20 μg/kg/minute, whichever was achieved first. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg) was treated with norepinephrine infusion, titrated to a MAP ≥65 mmHg. ScvO 2 was recorded hourly. Cardiac output was measured continuously using the FloTrac™ device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Continuous data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, and proportions were compared using Fisher's exact test. Results are presented as the mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated. Significance was defined as P <0.05.

## Effects of levosimendan on renal function in septic shock: a case-control study

Results APACHE II scores were 21 ± 7 versus 27 ± 7 (P = 0.02), and the ICU mortality was 10 (48%) versus 13 (62%) (P = 0.35) for groups L and D, respectively. The cardiac index was lower in group L compared with group D (estimated marginal mean ± SEM: 2.8 ± 0.1 vs. 3.2 ± 0.1, respectively, P <0.01) but the ScvO 2 changes over time did not differ between groups (P >0.5).

Norepinephrine was administered to 17 (81%) patients in group L and 21 (100%) in group D (P = 0.04).

Conclusions Dobutamine increased the cardiac index more than did levosimendan, although there was no difference between the two drugs with regard to their effects on ScvO 2 . 


## Introduction

The calcium sensitizer levosimendan enhances myocardial contractility, which could be advantageous in patients with myocardial ischemia requiring inotropic support. Methods During 3 years 3,852 patients with high-risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in our department. In 106 cases ACS was complicated with cardiogenic shock (mean age: 68.6 ± 1.2 years); moreover, in 26 cases patients had to be resuscitated (cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)). Short-term and long-term effects of levosimendan on cardiac functions and on survival of cardiogenic shock and post-CPR patients were analyzed. Levosimendan was administrated in 39 of 106 cases as add-on therapy for patients with impaired left ventricular function, by extensive wall motion abnormality and by high blood cardiac enzyme concentration. Levosimendan therapy was started in most cases on the second or third day and applied for 6 hours as a continuous infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min). The mean time spent in the primary cardiac care center (inhospital time) was 6.0 ± 0.4 days, and the whole follow-up was 204.6 ± 29.9 days long.


## Results

In the post-CPR patient group there was no significant difference in survival according to levosimendan treatment during short-term follow-up (36.5% vs. 40.0%, P = 0.790) and during long-term follow-up (15.6% vs. 15.0%, P = 0.754). On the other hand, for nonresuscitated patients the survival rates were significantly higher in the levosimendan-treated patient group during short-term follow-up (84.4% vs. 57.9%, P <0.001) and during long-term follow-up (47.3% vs. 23.0%, P <0.001). The time interval between the onset of myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention did not influence the effect of levosimendan on short-term and long-term mortality.

Conclusions In summary, levosimendan may improve cardiac function and decrease short-term and even long-term mortality in cardiogenic shock patients independently of the time interval of myocardial infarction. This positive effect of levosimendan may be abolished by post-CPR patients.

## Study of hemodynamics in patients treated with landiolol in the ICU


## Introduction

We experienced patients whose cardiac functions were maintained or deteriorated during the treatment of a shortacting β-blocker, landiolol. We therefore investigated the effects of landiolol on the cardiac function in patients.

Methods From January through December 2007, 21 patients were selected if they had tachycardia (heart rate (HR) >100 beats/min) and they were treated with continuous infusion of landiolol. Hemodynamics were recorded using pulmonary artery catheters at four time points (before administration of landiolol, 1 hour after beginning of administration, immediately before discontinuation of administration, and 1 hour after discontinuation of administration).

Infusion of landiolol was discontinued if the HR fell below 90 beats/min or the cardiac index (CI) fell below 2.0 l/min/m 2 . The paired Student t test was used to compare the differences. P <0.05 was statistically significant.

Results Between the point before administration of landiolol (2.4 ± 1.8 (mean ± SD) μg/kg/min) and 1 hour after beginning of administration, although the HR was decreased from 137 ± 20 beats/min to 109 ± 20 beats/min (P <0.01), the stroke index (SI) was increased from 20.4 ± 8.1 ml/beats/m 2 to 22.5 ± 7.0 ml/beats/m 2 , and thus the CI was maintained (2.76 ± 1.05 l/min/m 2 and 2.43 ± 0.78 l/min/m 2 ). Between the point before discontinuation of administration (1.4 ± 1.1 μg/kg/min) and 1 hour after discontinuation of administration, the HR was not increased significantly (93 ± 18 beats/min and 100 ± 16 beats/min), however the SI was increased 21.5 ± 6.7 ml/beats/m 2 to 25.7 ± 5.4 ml/beats/m 2 (P <0.05), and therefore the CI was increased 1.93 ± 0.54 l/min/m 2 to 2.50 ± 0.40 l/min/m 2 (P <0.01). Infusion of landiolol was discontinued because the HR fell below 90 beats/min in 12 patients and the CI fell below 2.0 l/min/m 2 in nine cases. There were no significant differences in the catecholamine index, pulmonary artery pressure, and central venous pressure.

Conclusions We investigated hemodynamics in 21 patients who used landiolol and recognized the effects of rate control and depression of the SI and the CI; thus when we use landiolol, we have to pay attention to the HR and cardiac function [1]. Introduction Pulmonary hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease commonly seen in ICU septic patients. PAH is characterized by alterations in the pulmonary circulation leading to right ventricular failure and is associated with poor outcome in such patients. Various agents such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been used for its treatment. Drugs that induce pulmonary vasodilatation, increase contractility and maintain a stable haemodynamic profile seem an attractive treatment option in acute PAH patients. However, there is lack of evidence-based guidelines in the current medical literature. Although oral diltiazem has been shown to improve haemodynamics in chronic PAH patients, it has not been used for the treatment of acute PAH. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of intravenous diltiazem on a porcine model of acute PAH during sepsis.

Methods PAH was induced in 16 anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs (25 kg) by intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg LPS (Escherichia coli, 111: B4) in a period of 30 minutes. After LPS administration, animals were randomly divided into two groups. Group A received intravenous diltiazem 280 to 400 μg/kg, and Group B an equal dose of placebo (normal saline) and served as the control. Haemodynamic measurements, including parameters of systemic and pulmonary circulation, were performed before and after LPS administration and every 20 minutes for 2 hours. Results After LPS infusion, both systolic pulmonary pressure (PAPs) and diastolic pulmonary pressure (PAPd) exhibited a statistically significant increase (PAPs from 18 ± 1 to 48 ± 7 mmHg, P <0.01 and PAPd, from 7.7 ± 0.7 to 27 ± 4 mmHg, P <0.01) and remained elevated over time. Diltiazem administration reduced significantly both PAPs and PAPd in relation to placebo (P <0.001), but not to baseline levels. The heart rate, cardiac output and systemic haemodynamics exhibited no difference between groups throughout the time period.

Conclusions Intravenous diltiazem was associated with a reduction of pulmonary pressure without any systemic hypotension in a porcine model of endotoxin-induced acute PAH. This may represent a significant advance in the treatment of acute PAH.

Postoperative arrhythmia is associated with higher morbidity and mortality [1]. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of oral β-blocker (celiprolol) and intravenous magnesium (Mg) on the frequency of supraventricular arrhythmia (SVA) after pulmonary resection.

Methods Twenty-six patients undergoing pneumonectomy or bilobectomy were randomised to receive either celiprolol (group 1, n = 13) or intravenous Mg (group 2, n = 13). Patients were excluded if they had a history of congestive heart failure, second-degree or greater heart block, a history of SVA, or were receiving oral β-blocker, diltiazem, or verapamil. Patients of group 1 received oral celiprolol (100 mg every 8 hours) starting before operation and continued for 10 days postoperatively. Group 2 received intravenously 2 g Mg at the time of the thoracotomy, at 6 hours then every day for 3 days. All patients were followed clinically with at least four daily ECGs for up to 10 days. Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package SPSS version 11.0. P <0.05 was considered significant. Introduction Esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction is the surgical treatment for cancer of the esophagus. The perfusion of the distal part of the gastric tube depends exclusively on the microcirculation, making it susceptible to hypoperfusion and ischemia. It is unknown whether an increased perfusion pressure can exert a beneficial effect on gastric tissue perfusion.


## Results

Methods For this purpose we performed a gastric tube reconstruction in 12 pigs, mean bodyweight 32 ± 1 kg (mean ± SE). Besides systemic hemodynamic parameters, the gastric microvascular blood flow (MBF) was assessed on pylorus, corpus and fundus with laser Doppler flowmetry and gastric microvascular HbO 2 saturation (mHbSO 2 ) and hemoglobin concentration (mHbcon) with spectrophotometry. Animals were evenly randomized over two groups: in both groups the mean arterial pressure was increased from 50 to 110 mmHg with infusion of noradrenaline; however, in the nitroglycerin (NTG) group the central venous pressure was maintained below 10 mmHg throughout the entire experiment with intravenous NTG. In this way, we aimed to increase the perfusion pressure gradient over the gastric tube tissue.

Results Central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were lower in the NTG group. Although the systemic circulation tended to be more dynamic in the NTG group at baseline, all systemic hemodynamic parameters were similar in both groups throughout the experiment. Baseline MBF was all-over higher in the NTG group. Following surgery, in both groups the MBF decreased severely especially in the upper gastric tube. At higher mean arterial pressure (MAP), MBFs tended to be higher than at the lowest MAP levels. Overall, MBFs were higher in the NTG group. mHbcon levels increased significantly with the initial decreases in flow and remained lower in the NTG group. mHbSO 2 values were no different between groups and did not change accordingly at different MAP levels.

Conclusions In our experimental model, tissue perfusion is severely compromised following formation of the gastric tube; this effect is aggravated by systemic hypotension independent from cardiac output. Venous congestion might contribute to this effect and can be prevented with continuous intravenous administration of NTG. Clinical studies will have to demonstrate an effect on anastomotic healing and outcome.

Introduction Vasopressin has been suggested as a useful vasoactive agent in the support of vasodilatory shock in adults; however, its effect in children is unclear. We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin in this population, administered as an adjunctive vasoactive agent, would lead to more rapid reversal of vasodilatory shock when compared with placebo.

Methods In this multicenter, double-blind trial, children with clinical evidence of vasodilatory shock were randomized to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.0005 to 0.002 U/kg/min) or placebo in addition to open-label vasoactive agents. Vasoactive infusions were titrated according to established guidelines to maintain target mean arterial pressure and adequate perfusion. The primary outcome was the time to vasoactive-free hemodynamic stability. Secondary outcomes included mortality, organ-failure free days, length of stay, and adverse and serious adverse events.

Results Sixty-five out of 69 children (94%) who were randomized received the study drug (33 vasopressin, 32 placebo) and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and placebo groups in the time to vasoactive-free hemodynamic stability (49.7 vs. 47.1 hours, respectively, P = 0.85). There were 10 deaths (30%) in the vasopressin group and five deaths (15.6%) in the placebo group (relative risk = 1.94; 95% CI = 0.75 to 5.05, P = 0.24). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to organ-failure free days (22 vs. 25.5 days, P = 0.11), ventilator-free days (16.5 vs. 23 days, P = 0.15), length of pediatric critical care unit stay (8 vs. 8.5 days, P = 0.93), or the adverse and serious adverse event rate ratios (12.0%, 95% CI = -2.6 to 26.7, P = 0.15; and 3.2%, 95% CI = -13.7 to 7.8, P = 0.55, respectively). Conclusions In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients with vasodilatory shock, low-dose vasopressin did not demonstrate any beneficial effects but a concerning trend in mortality.

S74 vasoconstriction, V2 receptor stimulation promotes coagulation, at least in part through an increase in plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) activity. We hypothesized that, at an intravenous infusion rate representative of the requirements for the treatment of sepsis-induced vasodilatory hypotension in sheep [2], AVP provides procoagulant activities. We tested this hypothesis by measuring vWF:Ag activity in unanesthetized healthy sheep during administration of AVP in comparison with the vWF:Ag activity increase induced by the selective V2 receptor agonist desmopressin (dDAVP).

Methods After two to four measurements of vWF:Ag activity and hemoglobin (Hb) over a 1-hour baseline (BL) period, 13 female sheep were randomly administered one of two treatments: an intravenous bolus of dDAVP (1 nmol/kg; n = 7) or a 2-hour intravenous infusion of AVP (3 pmol/kg/min; n = 6). vWF:Ag activity and Hb were measured every 30 minutes over 2 hours from the time of dDAVP administration or the initiation of AVP administration. For each sheep, vWF:Ag activity was corrected for plasma volume by calculating the vWF:Ag activity/Hb ratio and was expressed as percentage of the mean BL value. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Results Following dDAVP bolus injection and during AVP infusion, the vWF:Ag activity/Hb ratio increased to a maximum of 135 ± 4% (n = 7) and 135 ± 6% (n = 4) of mean BL value, respectively (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002 vs. BL, respectively). The vWF:Ag activity/Hb ratio did not increase beyond the maximal fluctuation range of BL measurements in two out of the six sheep treated with AVP (maximum increases of 96% and 101%).

Conclusions At an intravenous infusion rate representative of the requirements for the treatment of sepsis-induced vasodilatory hypotension in sheep [2], the V1a/V2 receptor dual-agonist AVP increased vWF:Ag activity to the same extent as the selective V2 receptor agonist dDAVP. Because of its V2 receptor agonist activity, the use of AVP may potentially amplify the microcirculation impairment caused by sepsis-induced coagulopathy. 


## Introduction

The present study was designed as a prospective, randomized, laboratory experiment to compare the effects of a selective V1-agonist (Phe2-Orn8-vasotocin), a selective V2antagonist ((propionyl1-D-Tyr(Et)2-Val4-Abu6-Arg8,9)-vasopressin) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), when given as first-line therapy, on hemodynamics, metabolic changes, mesenteric blood flow (Qma) and mortality using a clinically relevant model of septic shock [1]. Methods Fecal peritonitis was induced in 21 anesthetized, invasively monitored, mechanically ventilated sheep. A combination of crystalloids and 6% hydroxyethyl starch was titrated to maintain constant hematocrit. Following the shock time (ST), defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60 mmHg, sheep were randomly assigned to receive either a continuous infusion of 1 μg/kg/hour V2-antagonist, 0.05 μg/kg/minute V1-agonist or 0.5 mU/kg/minute AVP (n = 7 each). Norepinephrine was titrated up to a maximum of 1 μg/kg/minute to maintain MAP at 70 ± 5 mmHg in all groups. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM.

Results No significant differences between groups were detected at baseline and ST. The cardiac index and urine flow were similar between groups. The V1-agonist led to a higher Qma than in both other groups from 5 to 8 hours after ST (P <0.05 each). Compared with AVP, selective V1-agonism stabilized MAP more effectively and allowed a reduction in cumulative norepinephrine requirements from 4 to 8 hours. The V1-agonist and the V2antagonist did not differ in these variables. V2-antagonism attenuated the decrease in base excess compared with both other groups and was associated with increased fluid requirements compared with V1-agonism (18 ± 1 vs. 14 ± 1 ml/kg/hour). Compared with AVP, the V1-agonist and the V2-antagonist reduced arterial lactate levels (3.5 ± 0.5 and 4.1 ± 0.3 mmol/l vs. 5.5 ± 0.2 mmol/l, P <0.02 each) and prolonged survival (13 ± 1 hour and 14 ± 1 hour vs. 10 ± 1 hour; P <0.01 each). Introduction Vasopressin is commonly used as an adjunct to catecholamines to support blood pressure in refractory septic shock. Its effect on vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery is unknown. We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would decrease the length of stay in the ICU in patients submitted to cardiac surgery with a pump. Methods We assigned patients who presented vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery in the first 24 hours after arrival in the ICU. During 6 months, out of 458 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 82 developed vasoplegia shock and participated in the study. We randomly assigned patients to receive norepinephrine (initial doses of 5 mg) or vasopressin (0.01 to 0.04 U/min). All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain a target blood pressure. The primary endpoint was the length of ICU stay. Secondary endpoints were mortality, timing of needing vasopressors, incidence of organ dysfunction and adverse effects. Results A total of 82 patients were included in the analysis -42 patients received norepinephrine and 40 patients received vasopressin. There was a significant difference between the norepinephrine and vasopressin groups in the length of ICU stay (4.2 days vs. 7.3 days, P <0.005). Also, the vasopressin group of patients presented a lower incidence of renal failure compared with the norepinephrine group (4.5% vs. 8.9%, P <0.001). There was no significant difference in the overall rates of adverse events, rates of mortality and timing of vasopressor therapy. Conclusions Low-dose vasopressin reduced the length of ICU stay and the incidence of renal failure in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery compared with norepinephrine. Also, the vasopressin group did not present more adverse events. In previous studies, we have found a higher incidence of ACRI in arterial femoral than in radial access sites. In the present study, we increased the number of arterial catheters in order to increase the probability of finding significant differences in the incidence of ACRI between other arterial accesses.  (0) access (OR = 7.6; 95% CI = 1.37 to infinite; P = 0.01) and brachial (0) access (OR = 6.2, 95% CI = 1.11 to infinite; P = 0.03). We did not find significant differences in the ACRI incidence per 1,000 arterial catheter days between radial and dorsalis pedis (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.24 to infinite; P = 0.73); and between radial and brachial access (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.20 to infinite; P = 0.88).

Conclusions Our results suggest that femoral arterial access should be avoided in order to minimize the risk of arterial catheterrelated infection.


## P187

Inline filtration reduces the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in critically ill children Rates of CRBSI may be modified by clinical care during insertion and utilisation of central venous catheters (CVCs) [1]. As such, the incidence of CRBSI has been proposed as a quality indicator. There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of CRBSI. Methods We applied two internationally recognised guidelines [1,2] to evaluate the CRBSI prevalence in a prospective study of CVC replacements over 3 months on an adult cardiothoracic ICU. We utilised these criteria for confirmed CRBSI but considered additionally CVC colonisation and possible CRBSI. CVC tips were sent for semiquantitative culture, and contemporaneous blood was drawn for qualitative culture from both the CVC and a peripheral vein. Possible CRBSI was defined as positive CVC blood culture and tip in the absence of a peripheral blood culture; colonised CVC was defined as a positive tip and negative blood culture. Results A total of 33 CVCs were replaced for: clinical suspicion of a CRBSI (64%); duration of use (24%); incidental positive blood culture (9%); and clinical evidence of catheter site infection (3%). Ninety-one per cent of CVC tips were sent for culture. Fifty-eight per cent of cases had paired blood cultures sent. The incidence of antimicrobial therapy at the time of blood sampling was 85%. Only a single CVC replacement (3%) was associated with a confirmed CRBSI. By contrast, the incidence of possible CRBSI was greater (45%).

Conclusions Clinical suspicion of CRBSI was associated with infrequent microbiological confirmation. The impact of antibiotic therapy on diagnostic sensitivity is unknown. The incidence of possible CRBSI was much greater; we believe this entity encompasses unknown proportions of both colonised CVCs and CRBSI.

The widely used definitions of CRBSI probably therefore underestimate the true incidence: this limits their utility to describe a parameter that may benchmark different ICUs and drive quality improvement processes within an ICU. We propose that both confirmed and possible CRBSI rates should be recorded as (different) surrogates for the true rate. Finally, this illustrates the shortcomings of assessing outcomes (CRBSI rate). Measuring adherence to quality control processes (care bundles) may be a better comparator. Methods Data from two randomized, double-blind, phase 3 micafungin trials evaluating treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis (n = 842) were analysed. Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate: associations of baseline CVC removal within 24 hours (CVC24) and 48 hours (CVC48) versus nonremoval with each treatment outcome; and associations of potential confounding factors with treatment outcomes. A final multivariate analysis was performed on those associations with P ≤0.10. Results Univariate analysis revealed that CVC24 was associated with 28-day survival (P = 0.05) and 42-day survival (P = 0.05), and CVC48 with 28-day survival (P = 0.01), 42-day survival (P = 0.01), and overall treatment success (P = 0.02). Neither CVC24 nor CVC28 were associated with time to mycological eradication. After controlling for confounding variables such as baseline Candida species, APACHE II score, underlying disease, and so on, multivariate analysis revealed that neither CVC24 nor CVC48 were statistically significant prognostic indicators for 28-day and 42-day survival ( Figure 1). In addition, CVC48 was not associated with overall treatment success. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 


## Introduction

The use of pulse pressure variation (PPV) and systolic pressure variation (SPV) is possible during controlled mechanical ventilation (MV) [1]. Even in acute respiratory failure, controlled MV tends to be replaced by assisted ventilatory support, which may generate a tidal volume (Tv) inadequate to change the pulmonary venous flow and swing in pleural pressure [2]. This makes the use of dynamic indices unreliable. Our hypothesis was that during a pressure-support-assisted ventilatory (PSV) approach few imposed breaths (flow-triggered synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV)) could allow the monitoring of PPV and SPV. We therefore tested whether PPV and SPV during PSV + SIMV could be as accurate as in controlled MV. Methods A prospective case-control study. Thirty patients who met the criteria of weaning from controlled MV were included. PPV and SPV were measured, first, during 20 minutes in PSV with three per minute flow-triggered SIMV breaths (10 ml/kg, duration 5 s, inspiration to expiration ratio 1:3) (T1), and then during three consecutive breaths in controlled MV (respiratory rate 12/min, duration 5 s, inspiration to expiration ratio 1:3, Tv 10 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure and FiO 2 as in PSV) (T2). Throughout 20 minutes of data collection, saline infusions were kept constant (3 ml/hour) without performing any fluid loading. Correlation and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare respective values of PPV and SPV in the two modes of ventilation. Results Significant correlations were found between dynamic indices in SIMV during pressure support ventilation and those in controlled MV mode. The mean differences between two measurements were: PPV 0.6 ± 2.8% (limit of agreement: -5.0 and 6.2), SPV 0.5 ± 2.3 mmHg (limit of agreement: -4.0 and 5.1).

Conclusions PPV and SPV measured during SIMV fitted with the findings in controlled MV. Dynamic indexes could be accurately monitored in patients breathing with assisted respiratory assistance adding an imposed large enough SIMV breath [3].

Introduction Dynamic parameters predict fluid responsiveness and improve fluid management during surgery. We intend to demonstrate that the noninvasive pleth variability index (PVI) guides peroperative fluid management and optimizes the circulatory status. Methods Patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were randomized into two groups comparing the peroperative PVIdirected fluid management (group P) versus standard care (control, group C). Protocol: induction of general anesthesia was followed by, in group P, 500 ml followed by 2 ml/kg/hour crystalloids; 250 ml colloids infused if PVI >13% for more than 5 minutes; if required, vasoactive support was introduced after lowering PVI <10%. In group C, 500 ml crystalloids followed by fluids at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Results Eighty-two patients completed the protocol. No difference was detected in preoperative characteristics, type of surgery and anesthesia. Peroperative and postoperative (24-hour) crystalloid infusions were significantly different. Lactate levels were significantly lower in group P, whereas the peroperative and postoperative volumes infused in group P were lower (Figure 1).


## Conclusions

The PVI improves peroperative fluid management in abdominal surgery. The reduced mean volume infused associated with reduced lactate levels suggests the capacity of the PVI to infer tailored fluid administration.

Introduction New predictors of fluid responsiveness have been obtained from plethysmographic waveforms displayed on pulse oxymeters. However, they require recordings on a PC and offline operator-dependent analysis. A new parameter called the plethysmography variability index (PVI) has been proposed by a pulse oxymetry manufacturer to be used for the purpose of fluid responsiveness. Its advantage is that it can be automatically calculated and displayed on the screen of the pulse oxymetry monitor. The aim of the study is to test the accuracy of this parameter to predict fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. Methods Inclusion criteria were septic shock patients fully adapted to their respirator and on sinus rhythm. Methods involved simultaneous recording of the following tracings: invasive blood pressure, plethysmography pulse oxymeter (Philips™), ECG, airway pressure and digit values inscribed on the device (Masimo™). Echocardiography was used to calculate the velocity-time integral (VTI). We infused fluid (500 ml saline) in patients with pulse pressure variation (ΔPP) ≥15% and performed passive leg raising (PLR) in patients with ΔPP <15%. We compared the PVI with ΔPP and with the variability of pulse oxymeter wave amplitude (ΔPPleth) and sought the best threshold PVI value that predicted ΔPP >15%. Patients who increased their VTI by more than 15% in response to fluid or to PLR were defined as responders. The significance of the PVI threshold to distinguish between responders and nonresponders was examined.

Results In the first step 25 patients were enrolled. Fifty paired values were analysed. The r 2 coefficients between ΔPP-PVI, ΔPPleth-PVI and ΔPP-ΔPPleth were 0.81, 0.79 and 0.74, respectively. A threshold PVI value of 20 identified patients with ΔPP >15% with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 90%. In a second step 18 other patients were enrolled. All patients with PVI >20 (n = 8) were fluid responders and 10 patients with PVI <20 were PLR nonresponders.


## Conclusions

The PVI automatically obtained from a pulse oxymetry device seems an accurate index of fluid responsiveness. The numerical value of 20 distinguished responders from nonresponders with good sensitivity and specificity. Introduction Dynamic preload indicators are superior to static indicators for predicting fluid responsiveness [1][2][3]. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of a low tidal volume on the capacity of pulse pressure variation (PPV) to predict fluid responsiveness.


## P206

Methods A transversal and interventional study that included 30 critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure, sedated and mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 to 7 ml/kg. Mechanical ventilatory measurements including positive endexpiratory pressure plateau and peak pressures, static compliance and hemodynamic measurements including PPV, heart rate, mean systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index were obtained before and after fluid challenge, performed with 1,000 ml crystalloids or 500 ml colloids. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac index of at least 15%. Results Thirty patients were enrolled: aged 56 ± 16.8 years, APACHE score = 28 ± 8, male = 15; 19 patients with septic shock, one patient with sepsis, five patients in postoperative liver transplantation, three patients with acute pancreatitis, one patient with cardiogenic shock and one patient in postoperative aortic Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1  Introduction Fluid responsiveness is still a cornerstone in managing patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Recently new technologies have been generated for facilitating the accuracy of predicting fluid responsiveness at the bedside, based on cardiopulmonary interaction [1,2]. We evaluated the effectiveness and accuracy of three dynamic indices, currently available in intensive care monitoring devices, which are pulse pressure variation (PPV) [3], stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform variation (POPV) in septic mechanically ventilated patients [4].    Results Both HUT and PLR induced significant changes in SV ( Figure 1). Introduction Pulse pressure variation (PPV) for prediction of fluid responsiveness depends on the tidal volume (VT), and using VTs of the recommended 6 ml/kg makes PPV unreliable [1]. So far, nobody has suggested how to handle the VT when interpreting PPV or other dynamic parameters, but we hypothesise that PPV is proportional to VT and thus that PPV should be indexed to VT. The aim was to investigate how three VT levels affected PPV at four different intravascular volumes. Methods The study was approved by the national animal ethical committee. Eight anesthetised and ventilated pigs (23 to 27 kg) were bled 25% of the blood volume (hypovolemia). PPV was measured at ventilation with VTs of 6, 9 and 12 ml/kg (VT6, VT9 and VT12, respectively). Thereafter, depleted blood was replaced with voluven (normovolemia) and PPV was again measured at the three VT levels and subsequently at the +25% and +50% hypervolemic levels also generated with voluven infusion. PPV values were log-transformed and compared with a paired t test. Comparisons were made at each intravascular volume level between VT6 and VT9, VT9 and VT12, and VT6 and VT12. Because three comparisons were performed, P <0.05/3 = 0.017 was considered significant. Results All comparisons for PPV at different VTs were significantly different (P <0.001); see Table 1 for factorial increases in PPV. At -25% hypovolemia, PPV did not fully double with doubling of VT, whereas PPV slightly more than doubled at normovolemia and hypervolemia.

## Introduction

The aim of the study was to see how many patients were fluid responders on arrival in the ICU and to evaluate the performance of dynamic preload indices in predicting fluid responsiveness in fully sedated and mechanically ventilated patients. The following indices were studied: pulse pressure variation (PPV), stroke volume variation (SVV) and systolic pressure variation (SPV).

Methods Patients were monitored with the LiDCOTMplus and received a fluid challenge (250 ml boluses of colloid in 5 min) to ascertain fluid responsiveness. Patients in which a fluid challenge produced a 10% increase in stroke volume were considered fluid responders and thus the fluid challenge was repeated according to the unit protocol [1]. In fully mechanically ventilated patients, the PPV, SVV and SPV were recorded and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed.

Results Thirty-three patients (mean age 64 years; SD ± 13.80; mean BMI 27.34; 16 female and 17 male) were included; 23 patients were on spontaneous ventilation and 10 were totally fully ventilated with a mean tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and positive endexpiratory pressure of 5 cmH 2 O. Thirteen patients (40%) were responders, of which five were mechanically ventilated. Areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness were examined for ventilated patients; for PPV, AUC = 0.65 with SD ± 0.14, P = 0.28 showing a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 79% for a cutoff value of 14%; for SVV, AUC = 0.73 with SD ± 0.14, P = 0. Introduction Haemodynamic monitoring is a cornerstone of intensive care. In addition to parameters of preload and afterload, the assessment of cardiac output (CO) is of paramount importance. Thermodilution (TD) using the pulmonary artery catheter and transpulmonary TD using the PiCCO device are the gold standards for CO determination. After calibration by TD, the PiCCO device is able to assess CO using pulse contour (PC) analysis. Despite an overall good correlation of PC-CO and TD-CO in several studies, the manufacturer suggests recalibration by TD after 8 hours. Little is known about the long-term accuracy of PC-CO. Therefore it was the aim of our prospective study to investigate the long-term accuracy of PiCCO-2-derived PC-CO in the daily ICU routine. Methods In 10 consecutive patients (five male, five female, age 65 ± 15 years) the PC-CO was recorded immediately before recalibration by TD-CO. One hundred and ninety-four measurements with a mean time-lag between two measurements of TD-CO of 663.5 ± 371 min (100 to 2,700) were recorded. Mechanical ventilation, catecholamine and arrhythmia occurred in 60 (31%), 132 (68%) and 154 (79%) of the measurements.


## Results

The 194 pairs of PC-CO and TD-CO showed a highly significant correlation (P <0.001; r = 0.875). There was no significant difference between PC-CO versus TD-CO (4.1 ± 1.  Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Established methods to optimize cardiac function and fluid balance based on flow-related variables are invasive or require considerable attentiveness. The purpose of this study was to guide intraoperative fluid and catecholamine therapy in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease undergoing major abdominal surgery using a recently introduced less-invasive device without the need for manual calibration (FloTrac/Vigileo™) and to determine possible improvement in outcome by means of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plasma levels and the duration of hospital stay. Methods Forty American Society of Anesthesiologists III patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery with pre-existing cardiac disease (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy) were studied. Patients were randomly allocated into a standard care group and an intervention group, where a stroke volume variation (SVV) and cardiac index (CI)-based protocol for volume and catecholamine therapy was implemented until the end of surgery. In brief, CI ≥2.5 l/min/m 2 was aimed for, with a SVV threshold value for fluid challenge of 12%. After the baseline (skin incision), haemodynamic data and plasma NT-proBNP levels were obtained after 180 minutes, at the end of surgery, 5 hours post surgery, and on postoperative days 1 and 2, and the ICU and hospital stays were recorded. Results Demographic data and Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity physiology and operation score values were comparable between the groups. The intervention group received significantly more colloid volume replacement and more dobutamine; crystalloid volume replacement and norepinephrine consumption did not differ. Plasma NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in the standard care group on postoperative days 1 and 2 (832 ± 675 vs. Results There were no significant differences in basic demographic and laboratory data among the four groups.  Introduction Shock is a critical condition. The knowledge and skills of the physician can improve the outcome of these patients. We therefore studied the factors that affect physician knowledge and skill. Methods We enrolled 12 shocked patients admitted to the medical ICU, their symptoms having been evaluated by the patientcare team for defining the type of shock [1,2]. Venous catheterization (central venous pressure) and arterial catheterization (A-line) had been performed for invasive monitoring data [3]. After that either clinical evaluation data or invasive monitoring data were collected for analysis [4]. Results All 12 shock patients, seven men and five women, were defined in four groups: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive and distributive/septic shock in four cases, two cases, one case, and five cases, respectively. Shock was defined by 38 volunteer physicians, 27 men and 11 women. All physicians were studying in the training program: 28 were in the residency program (first, second and third years -12, eight and eight physicians, respectively), 10 in the fellowship training program (first and second years equally   Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data of all 23 cadavers whose EVLW was measured using the single indicator transpulmonary thermodilution system (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany) at four teaching hospitals from July 2004 to November 2008. We evaluated the relationship between EVLW, the postmortem lung weight and the amount of plural effusion.

Results Although the amount of the plural effusion was between 10 ml and 1,600 ml, we found very close correlation between premortem transpulmonary measurements of EVLW and postmortem lung weight (Figure 1; n = 23, R = 0.954, R 2 = 0.91).

Conclusions Measurement of the EVLW using the PiCCO system is very closely correlated with gravimetric measurement of lung weight, which is independent of the amount of pleural fluid.  Figure 1.

Conclusions We conclude that in sepsis ScvO 2 does not reliably predict SvO 2 , independent of the sepsis origin. The difference between ScvO 2 and SvO 2 in sepsis appears not to be a fixed one. Also, this difference seems independent of several hemodynamic parameters.    S96 goal-directed fluid therapy remain controversial, with concerns regarding the risk of overhydration. We used a splanchnic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model with a high mortality rate to test whether fluid infusion aimed to target constant left ventricular enddiastolic volume (LVEDV) would ameliorate physiologic and biologic parameters in this situation.

Methods Two groups of adult rats were subjected to 90 minutes of mesenteric ischemia followed by 150 minutes of reperfusion, with one group (I/R+Vol) receiving fluids (one-half glucose 5% and one-half Isohes ® ) to maintain the LVEDV at baseline levels during reperfusion, and the other group (I/R) receiving no extra fluids. A sham group (instrumented without I/R) served as controls.

Results In spite of a persisting acidosis, the LVEDV-directed fluid therapy was able to prevent the rapid fatal outcome, without evidence of overhydration (Figure 1), as demonstrated by the absence of an increased lung wet/dry weight ratio.

Conclusions Early LVEDV-directed fluid therapy markedly improves the outcome from mesenteric I/R injury.


## P233

Utility of brain natriuretic peptide as a marker of early cardiac risk in patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurism repair and changes in peripheral circulation has not been investigated. After successful regional anaesthesia blocks, local vasodilation and increased local blood flow occur as a result of blockade of sympathetic nerve fibers. We therefore studied the effects of peripheral vasodilation induced by regional anaesthesia blocks on resting StO 2 values. 


## Methods


## Introduction

The hypothesis was that anemia, independently of hemodynamic stability, affects tissue oxygenation saturation (StO 2 ) and the deoxygenation rate during stagnant ischemia. The blood hemoglobin concentration is determinant of oxygen delivery. In anemic patients, oxygen delivery decreases and oxygen extraction is increased. This leads to decreased venous hemoglobin saturation and a lower tissue oxygen saturation. The rate of tissue deoxygenation during ischemia is dependent on oxygen consumption and on the amount of oxygen available in the tissue [1].

Methods In a prospective observational study we included 340 patients in the medical emergency room. On admission, StO 2 and the tissue deoxygenation rate during ischemia were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. Patients were divided into four groups according to hemoglobin concentration and hemodynamic (HD) stability: Group 1 (nonanemic, HD-stable patients), Group 2 (anemic, HD-stable patients), Group 3 (nonanemic, HD-unstable patients), Group 4 (anemic, HD-unstable patients). Differences in StO 2 and the rate of tissue deoxygenation were analyzed. Results Anemic groups had a significantly lower hemoglobin concentration compared with nonanemic groups (138 ± 16 vs.

76.5 ± 15 g/l, P <0.001). HD-unstable groups had significantly higher lactate levels compared with HD-stable groups (1.6 ± 0.6 vs. 3.9 ± 1.6 mmol/l, P <0.001). The results are presented in Table  1. StO 2 in Groups 2 and 3 was comparable, while the difference in the deoxygenation rate in these groups was significant (P = 0.007).

Conclusions Anemia significantly affects StO 2 and the deoxygenation rate. It probably contributes to lower StO 2 equally as HD instability. In contrast to HD instability, anemia causes more rapid deoxygenation during ischemia. Reference 1.  Effect of peripheral blood flow variations in StO 2 during regional block.  with near-infrared spectroscopy and vascular occlusion (VOT) has been used to study pathophysiological states, but there is a paucity of data for standardised techniques in normal subjects. Three-minute VOT is frequently described. We have collected StO 2 data for this technique and compared them with a shorter 2-minute test. Methods Twenty-five subjects were studied using an InSpectra 650 monitor and a 15 mm probe. VOT was applied at systolic blood pressure + 50 mmHg on opposite arms for 3-minute and 2-minute time periods. StO 2 data are reported for baseline, downslope (DS) and upslope (US)%/minute, overshoot%, area over the ischaemic curve (AOC Isch) and area under the recovery curve (AUC Rec)%/minute and recovery time (Rec Time) in minutes. Differences were analysed using paired t tests. Individual differences were then examined in relation to a predicted magnitude of response based on the ischaemic load and occlusion time. These patterns imply a preconditioned adaptation to repeated VOT and an exaggerated hyperaemic response. Further studies are required to determine acceptable rest periods between VOTs to ameliorate these changes.


## Results

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Microcirculatory, leukocyte/endothelium interaction and 7-day survival time effects of human recombinant C-reactive protein (rCRP) associated or not with volume resuscitation were studied in the hamster window chamber model during resuscitation from nonhypotensive endotoxemia [1,2]. Methods Awake hamsters subjected to endotoxemia with intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (2 mg/kg) were divided, 1 hour after LPS injection, into four groups: LPS (n = 6): no treatment; VR (n = 6): received 40 ml/kg body weight of NaCl 0.9% in 1 hour followed by 20 ml/kg body weight during the remaining 4 hours; rCRP (n = 6): received rCRP infusion in the dose of 24 μg/kg/hour during 5 hours; VR/rCRP (n = 6): received 40 ml/kg body weight of NaCl 0.9% in the first hour followed by 20 ml/kg body weight during the remaining 4 hours, and in the last period it was combined with rCRP infusion in the dose of 24 μg/kg/hour. Groups were compared with Control (n = 6): no LPS. Arteriolar and venular diameters, functional capillary density (FCD), venular leukocyte rolling and adhesion, and 7-day survival time were evaluated. Results LPS reduced FCD so it was maintained lower than Control and baseline even after 24 hours (13 ± 11 and 100 ± 7% from baseline in LPS and Control, respectively). Volume resuscitation and rCRP restored FCD to baseline levels but it was lower than Control after 24 hours (36 ± 25 and 32 ± 20% from baseline in VR and rCRP, respectively). VR/rCRP restored FCD and it was not different from Control (72 ± 26% from baseline in rCRP). Arteriolar and venular diameters were not different among groups. LPS increased the number of sticking leukocytes to the venular wall (41.2 ± 13 and 1.1 ± 1 leucocytes/mm 2 in LPS and Control, respectively). rCRP and VR/rCRP significantly reduced venular leukocyte adhesion (12.6 ± 7.1 and 11.8 ± 9.5 leucocytes/mm 2 in rCRP and VR/rCRP, respectively). There was no difference in rolling leukocytes among groups. The survival curve was not significantly different in rCRP, VR and VR/rCRP from Control. Conclusions rCRP associated or not with volume resuscitation improved tissue perfusion, reduced the number of sticking leukocytes and increased the survival time during endotoxemia in the hamster model.  Introduction To assess potential metabolic and microcirculatory alterations in critically ill patients, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used, in combination with a vascular occlusion test (VOT), for the noninvasive measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ), oxygen consumption, and microvascular reperfusion and reactivity. However, the methodologies for assessing StO 2 are very inconsistent in the literature and results vary from study to study. In this study we investigated the effects of the probe spacing and measurement site, using both a 15 mm and a 25 mm probe spacing on the thenar and the forearm, in healthy volunteers. Methods StO 2 was noninvasively measured in eight healthy volunteers during 3-minute VOTs using two InSpectra Tissue Spectrometers equipped with either a 15 mm or a 25 mm probe. VOT-derived StO 2 traces were analyzed for baseline, ischemic, reperfusion, and hyperemic parameters.

## Assessment of tissue oxygen saturation during a vascular occlusion test using near-infrared spectroscopy: role of the probe spacing and measurement site studied in healthy volunteers


## Results

Although not apparent at baseline, the probe spacing and measurement site significantly influenced VOT-derived StO 2 parameters (Figures 1 and 2). StO 2 parameters in the hyperemic phase of the VOT were shown to significantly correlate to the minimum StO 2 value after 3 minutes of ischemia.


## Conclusions

The present study showed that NIRS measurements in combination with a VOT are measurement site and probe dependent. Additionally, this study indicated that reactive hyperemia depends on the extent of ischemic hit and supports the use of a target StO 2 over the use of a fixed time of occlusion. Introduction It is known that formation of a gastric tube after esophagectomy impairs microcirculatory perfusion in the anastomotic region. The impaired microcirculatory perfusion is caused by poor arterial inflow and insufficient venous drainage, due to ligation of three of the four gastric arteries. We therefore hypothesized that improving venous drainage by giving nitroglycerin (NTG) and titrating norepinephrine (NE) to increasing levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP) would improve microcirculatory perfusion of the distal part of the gastric tube. Methods Five pigs, bodyweight 30.5 ± 0.5 kg (mean ± SD) were anaesthesized and instrumented for continuous hemodynamic monitoring. A median laparotomy was performed and a gastric tube was reconstructed. Laser speckle imaging was used to measure the microcirculatory blood flow (MBF) in the gastric tube. Laser speckle imaging is a laser-based technique that measures MBF in a macroscopic field at a video frame rate. NTG was titrated to in order to achieve a central venous pressure below 10 mmHg. MBF was measured at the base and at the distal site of the gastric tube at MAP increasing stepwise from 50 to 110 mmHg. For this purpose the MAP was decreased with infusion of propofol and increased with infusion of NE. We determined the flow at the distal site for each step compared with flow at the base of the gastric tube (fraction of flow) in percentages.


## P245 Effects of perfusion pressure on microcirculatory perfusion of gastric tubes in pigs

Results Hemodynamic values: MAP was increased in steps of 10 mmHg. The heart rate and cardiac output remained constant at around 123 ± 28 bpm and 4.2 ± 1.0 l/min, respectively. Central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure did not change throughout the experiment. MBF results: at MAP below 70 mmHg the fraction of flow at the distal part was 23.49 ± 3.47%. This increased significantly to 31.12 ± 9.15% at MAP between 70 and 90 mmHg. The fraction of flow for MAP above 90 mmHg was 29.42 ± 6.84%. See Figure 1.

Conclusions Hypotension impairs flow in the distal part compared with the base of the gastric tube. Normotension significantly improves flow in this region. MBF in the distal part does not benefit from increasing MAP to supranormal values.

## P246 Lack of autoregulatory blood flow escape in the skin after infusion of therapeutic levels of noradrenaline through a microdialysis system in healthy volunteers


## Introduction

In burn-injured patients we have previously shown that skin has a decreased autoregulatory blood flow adjustment. Lack of such a function in skin would make uncontrolled use of vasoconstrictors detrimental to this organ. If ischemia-like conditions are produced in the skin, use could enhance the inflammatory response and increase the risk of organ dysfunction. We exposed local areas of the skin in healthy volunteers to therapeutic levels of noradrenaline (NA) by infusion through microdialysis (MD) intradermally, to investigate whether autoregulatory escape is present in the skin during strong α 1 -adrenergic stimulation.

Methods Five subjects received three MD catheters (CMA 70) intradermally in the lower arm. Catheters were perfused for a 90-minute stabilizing period, Ringer solution with 20 mmol/l urea, for skin blood flow determinations (urea clearance). Thereafter NA 0.5 or 5 μg/ml was perfused (2 μl/min) for 60 minutes followed by a buffer washout period. After this 0.5 mg/ml nitroglycerine was perfused (2 μl/min) for 60 minutes. Samples were collected every 10 minutes and analysed for urea, lactate, pyruvate and glucose. Results During perfusion with NA 5 and 0.5 μg/ml, skin blood flow decreased significantly as indicated by changes in urea clearance; increased lactate pyruvate quotients and corresponding rapid decreases in tissue glucose levels. These changes further increased during the perfusion of pure buffer. Normalization was first noted during infusion of nitroglycerine.

Conclusions Both doses of NA, previously claimed to be physiological, induce a reproducible and severe vasoconstriction as indicated by effects on urea clearance, increases in lactate pyruvate quotients and decreases in tissue glucose. These data suggest that skin lacks an autoregulatory escape function and ischemia was induced in the skin of healthy volunteers by the NA infusion. The ischemia situation further deteriorated until an active vasodilatation was started. In this skin vascular model, in healthy volunteers, NA shows negative effects that may also be important for the critical care setting. Further studies are needed to validate these findings. Conclusions We could demonstrate significant alterations of the tissue-dependent microcirculation in patients after successful resuscitation. Patients in the post-resuscitation phase showed during therapeutic hypothermia an increased microcirculation, reflecting TVD and PVD, compared with the microcirculation after rewarming, independent of noradrenaline or dobutamine.

## Alterations of tissue-dependent microcirculation in patients after successful resuscitation H Busch, S Rahner, C Bode, T Schwab

Introduction Microcirculatory dysfunction is a key element in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock and is related to endothelial dysfunction. Studies in vivo have shown that infusion of magnesium sulphate increased endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in healthy people and patients with cardiac disorders, but the effect on the septic patient's vessels, especially small ones, is unknown. We hypothesized that magnesium sulphate infusion can improve microcirculation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods Six septic patients (mean age 56 ± 16 years), who had already been fluid resuscitated, underwent magnesium sulphate infusion 2 g over 60 minutes with additional volume loading and use of norepinephrine if required. Sublingual microcirculation was evaluated using side dark-field videomicroscopy (MicroScan ® ; MicroVisionMedical). Each patient's microcirculation was evaluated by examining three to six different sublingual areas (10 to 20 seconds/image). In all patients, measurements were obtained at baseline and after 60 minutes. Images were analyzed by semiquantitative scores of flow (mean flow index; proportion of perfused vessels) and density (total vascular density; perfused vascular density) of small vessels (<20 μm). Data are presented as median values (percentiles 25 to 75). Results Data of this study have shown that perfused vascular density increased from 9.7 (4.9 to 13.0) n/mm (at baseline) to 12.1 (10.1 to 13.6) n/mm (at 60 min), proportion of perfused vessels increased from 70 (40 to 83)% to 77 (67 to 85)% but without statistical significance, P = 0.068.

Conclusions Magnesium sulphate has a tendency to improve microcirculation in severe sepsis and septic shock patients, but further studies are needed to obtain more detailed results. 


## Introduction

The increase in endothelial capillary permeability represents one of the early and significant hallmarks of sepsis. An inflammatory-induced damage in endothelial glycocalyx has been identified as the mechanism involved in this increase in permeability in the condition of ischemia-reperfusion [1]. To date no data are available for glycocalyx damage in sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether sepsis-associated increase of permeability is due to glycocalyx alteration. Methods To induce sepsis, the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a clinically relevant model of polymicrobial infection that mimics human sepsis, was used [2]. Nine rats underwent CLP, two rats, receiving laparotomy only, served as control. Rats were then transcardially perfused with PBS and PBS + paraformaldehyde 4% at three different time points (3, 7 and 15 hours after CLP). Kidneys were collected and processed for light and confocal microscopy examination. Alterations in glycocalyx were studied using digoxigenin-labelled lectin maackia amurensis agglutinin (MMA) (to identify sialic acids, a large family of nine-carboxylated sugars present on the cell surface) and mouse monoclonal antibody against Syndecan-1 (an integral membrane proteoglycan).

Results In control rats, the luminal surface of the glomerular endothelium appeared intensely stained for MMA lectin and Syndecan-1, indicating the presence of normal glycocalyx. Since its early phase (3 hours), sepsis induced a significant alteration in the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx, which worsened at later time points (7 and 15 hours). At 15 hours, disruption of the glomerular architecture was also present.

Conclusions Alterations in endothelial glycocalyx may represent the first step of sepsis-related changes in permeability. It is likely that treatments aimed at preserving glycocalyx may also prevent not only the increase in permeability but possibly glomerular disruption.  Introduction Sepsis-associated renal failure is a common complication of septic shock. The current study investigates whether an innovative score of electron microscopic tubular injury (EMTI) is correlated with plasma creatinine concentration in ovine endotoxemic shock.

Methods Twenty-nine awake healthy ewes received a continuous endotoxin infusion until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell below 65 mmHg. Thereafter, sheep were optimally volume-resuscitated and received norepinephrine to establish a MAP of 70 ± 5 mmHg. After 12 hours animals were anesthetized and killed. Kidney tissue samples (10 per animal) were analyzed with standard transmission electron microscopy techniques. The EMTI score (0 to 12) was determined as the sum of (1) vacuolar cell degeneration (0 to 3), (2) basal membrane dissociation (0 to 3), (3) epithelial cell injury (0 to 3), and (4) luminal obstruction (0 to 3). The EMTI score was averaged as the mean value of the 10 kidney samples of each animal and was correlated with maximum plasma creatinine concentrations by Pearson product moment correlation.


## Results

The EMTI score (median 5.9; 25% to 75% range 4.1 to 6.9) significantly correlated with the plasma creatinine concentration (1.19; 1.06 to 1.34) with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.371 (P = 0.0476; Figure 1). Conclusions The EMTI score is useful to quantify alterations of renal tubular integrity and thereby reflects changes in renal function in ovine endotoxemia. Scientific use of the EMTI score may provide further insight into the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated renal failure. Introduction A prominent role of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines is increasingly recognized to play a prominent role in the development of renal injury during sepsis. Because of its high mortality rates, early detection of renal injury is of the utmost importance and the discovering of renal biomarkers seems promising in achieving this goal. Methods We induced endotoxin tolerance to accomplish an attenuated proinflammatory state by intravenous injection of Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients admitted to intensive care. Diagnosis of AKI relies on serum creatinine and urine flow. These have disadvantages of low specificity and sensitivity and a slow rate of change. Renal damage results in release of tubular enzymes into the urine. Measurement of urinary alpha glutathione S-transferase (αGST) and pi glutathione S-transferase (πGST) may indicate AKI more acutely and accurately than current methods of diagnosis. Methods Urine was collected from patients with a sepsis diagnosis 4 hourly over 48 hours. Urine was frozen, and urinary πGST and αGST measured. Fluid and vasopressor management was recorded, but managed independently. Serum creatinine was measured at 0, 24 and 48 hours. AKI was diagnosed using AKI Network criteria [1]. Results We present the first 35 patients recruited, 20 were male, 15 female. Median patient age was 53 years. Median APACHE II score was 13. Median ICU length of stay was 9 days. ICU mortality was 14%, hospital mortality 23%. AKI was diagnosed in 26% of patients. Statistical significance was tested by Wilcoxon signedrank test. Although the median πGST at 0 hours was elevated (11.8 μg/l (non-AKI) versus 22 μg/l (AKI)) this was not statistically significant between the two groups, P = 0.985. πGST did not demonstrate an increased urinary level in AKI versus non-AKI (median values 0.89 μg/l vs. 3.4 μg/l at 0 hours). See Figure 1.

## Inflammation-induced renal injury subsides when endotoxin tolerance develops in humans as measured by urine proteomics

Conclusions A trend towards early expression of πGST was identifiable in this study. This may indicate early detection of AKI, which may help guide therapeutic interventions. πGST does not seem to be released as a biomarker using this sepsis model, suggesting a more specific distal tubular injury. Further work is required to determine levels of πGST in nonstressed kidneys. Introduction Serum creatinine is a late marker of acute kidney injury (AKI). Plasma neutrophil gelatinase (pNGAL) is an early biomarker of AKI after cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of pNGAL to predict AKI in ICU patients. Methods All patients admitted to three ICUs of the same institution were enrolled in this prospective observational study. pNGAL was analyzed at ICU admission. RIFLE criteria were calculated at admission and for each day during the first week. Patients were classified according to RIFLE criteria (RIFLE 0 or 1). Four groups were identified: RIFLE 0-0, 1-1, 1-0 and 0-1.

Results During this 1-month period, 88 patients were included in the study. Thirty-six patients had RIFLE 0-0 with a mean pNGAL of 98 ± 60 nmol/l. Twenty-two patients had RIFLE 1-1 with a mean pNGAL of 516 ± 221 nmol/l. Twenty patients had no AKI at admission but developed AKI at 48 hours (24 to 96 hours) (RIFLE 0-1). In this case the mean pNGAL was 342 ± 183 nmol/l. Ten patients had RIFLE 1-0 and the mean pNGAL was 169 ± 100 nmol/l. With a cutoff value of 155 nmol/l, the sensibility and specificity to predict AKI were respectively 82% and 97%. Seven patients needed extrarenal therapy, all of them had pNGAL >155 nmo/l. The patients with pNGAL <155nmol/l had more shock, more sepsis and a higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score.

Conclusions pNGAL at ICU admission is an early biomarker of AKI in a setting in which the timing of kidney injury is unknown. pNGAL increases 48 hours before RIFLE criteria. 


## Introduction

We investigated the early predictive value of plasma and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) compared with serum creatinine in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a heterogeneous adult ICU population. Previous studies display the excellent predictive value of urine NGAL for AKI in a pediatric ICU setting [1,2]. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted, including 63 patients. After ICU admission, plasma and urine samples were collected at eight time points. NGAL measurements were performed using an ELISA. The difference between the increase in NGAL and the increase in serum creatinine was calculated in relation to the time point at which maximum AKI was reached (T = 0). AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network definitions.


## Results

Mean age (±SD) in years and APACHE II (±SD) scores for AKI I (n = 22), II (n = 21) and III patients (n = 20) were respectively (56 ± 18, 21 ± 7), (58 ± 19, 25 ± 8) and (63 ± 13, 27 ± 7). In AKI III patients, the difference between the increase in plasma NGAL and the increase in serum creatinine expressed as a percentage (95% CI) at 72, 48 and 24 hours prior to maximum AKI was 203% (-169 to 574), -10% (-221 to 830) and -25% (-205 to 155). For urine NGAL and serum creatinine the difference was respectively 584% (-603 to 1,770), 756% (12 to 1,499) and 726% (240 to 1,212). Figures 1 and 2 depict the increase in urine NGAL and serum creatinine separately and their difference in relation to T = 0. There was no positive difference in patients with AKI stages I and II for urine or plasma at any time point prior to maximum AKI. Conclusions NGAL is, compared with serum creatinine, an earlier predictor of AKI III, in a heterogeneous adult ICU population. Urine NGAL provides a larger and more sustained window of early prediction than plasma NGAL in patients with developing AKI III.

The use of urine NGAL as an early predictive biomarker for AKI III is therefore promising in an adult heterogeneous ICU setting. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1

In two of our eight studies CIN was significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions Our data indicate that CIN is associated with significant mortality, requirement of RRT and/or persistent renal impairment in nearly one-half of the patients. Since these data were collected in patients included in studies aimed at prophylaxis of CIN, the risk might be even more elevated in clinical routine. Prophylaxis of CIN should therefore be a major issue in patients at risk. There was a significant difference in the mean SAPS II score between the dead and alive patients (70 vs. 46, P <0.001).

Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that AKI III (OR = 5.75, 95% CI = 1.2 to 25.5) and SAPS II score ≥65 (OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 3.5 to 68.2) were found to be independent predictors of hospital mortality. Conclusions In septic patients, AKI III appeared to be a strong predictor of hospital mortality. This finding is similar to a previous study [3], which also showed that in patents with AKI only AKI III was an independent risk factor for hospital death. Conclusions AKI estimated by pRIFLE criteria occurs in major pediatric burns, and failure was associated with increased mortality. Patients with AKI had higher admission burn and illness severity, increased incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome, more operations, and had increased duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay. AKI is a marker of increased resource utilization and risk for adverse outcomes after burn injury in children.

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Methods We conducted a prospective study, approved by the ethics committee, enrolling 11 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock under CRRT. We measured the cytokines using the immunoassay method. The cytokine measurement was done every morning until the end of renal support. We analyzed the following data: age, severity scores (Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)), cytokines (TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10) levels on pre-filter, post-filter and ultrafiltrate samples. We correlated these data with filter duration, considering 24 hours as the maximum theoretical limit for effective cytokine removal. Results From the 11 patients enrolled, we collected 420 valid samples to measure the cytokine levels. The mean age and SAPS II were respectively 66 ± 10.7 years and 46 ± 27.1. The mean total SOFA score at admission and at day 3 were 11.2 ± 4 and 12.7 ± 4 respectively, with ΔSOFA = +1.3 points (P >0.05). The mean ICU hospitalization time was 25.9 ± 33.5 days. We have done 876 hours of dialytic therapy; 33 AN69 membranes were used, during a mean time of 26.5 ± 25.6 hours. The mean total levels found for cytokines are presented in Figure 1 and the levels depending on the filter duration are in Figure 2. The ICU mortality was 54.6%. Conclusions The present study does not allow us to define a specific pattern for the removal of inflammatory mediators related to CRRT. We observed a trend for cytokine reduction dependent on filter duration with the higher efficacy removal until 24 hours. The cytokine level found in the effluent does not reflect the absolute reduction found in post-filter, and this effect could be dependent on adsorption, according to other studies [1,2].

Introduction Adequate anticoagulation is a precondition to improve blood epuration. In a prospective crossover trial, we compared the removal of middle molecules in continuous renal replacement therapy, by two methods that used either trisodium citrate ACD (BRAUN Laboratories) or heparin as anticoagulation.

Methods Fourteen critically ill patients were treated by continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. The dialysate and hemofiltration flows were 1,500 ml/hour each. All patients received two sessions of 36 hours successively. Patients 1 to 7 received systemic heparinization first, then regional anticoagulation by citrate. Conversely, Patients 8 to 14 received heparin and then citrate. Every 12 hours during each session of renal replacement (T0, T12, T24 and T36), blood epuration of small molecules (urea, creatinine) and middle molecules (β 2 -microglobulin, retinol binding protein) were evaluated from blood and effluent samples. Results At all time periods, there was no significant difference in creatinine and urea clearances between citrate and heparin treatment, except in T12 where creatinine clearance was significantly higher when using citrate than when using heparin (38.5 ± 4.0 ml/min vs. 34 ± 4.1 ml/min, P = 0.02). We did not observe a significant decline of urea and creatinine clearance during the session. The retinol binding protein blood and effluent rates were limited and stable during the session. Between T0 and T12, results showed a significant improvement of β 2 -microglobulin clearance with using citrate or heparin. After T12, β 2 -microglobulin clearance decreased with citrate treatment and stayed stable with heparin. Clearance seems to be higher with citrate than heparin, however, with only a significant difference in T12 (20.1 ± 4.0 vs. 16.3 ± 3.1 ml/min, P = 0.02). Undergoing citrate treatment, we recorded significant metabolic alkalosis (P = 0.0025) but without hypernatremia.

Conclusions Regional citrate anticoagulation in continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration is an efficient and safe method of anticoagulation. Its impact upon blood epuration of small or middle molecules remains to be established. Hemodynamic stability was maintained in the patients on SLED, as none needed switchover to CRRT. The patients undergoing SLED were dialysed during daytime by the haemodialysis nurse, eliminating the need for a specialist nurse in the night. After a median 48 hours of CRRT, it was possible to switch to SLED, resulting in optimal utilization of resources. SLED was much cheaper than CRRT. In a country like India where often there are economical constraints, the judicious use of SLED will help us optimize the need for CRRT.

Observational cohort of renal replacement therapy patients at a district general hospital ICU: case mix and outcomes  [1,3]. We found the APACHE II score to predict mortality accurately, in contrast to published work showing underprediction [2]. This may represent a better outcome in our cohort. We were unable to demonstrate a correlation between the RIFLE score at initiation of RRT and hospital mortality. This could be due to small numbers, or to an equivalence of outcome for the RIFLE classes once RRT is established. Methods Measurements were performed in 11 healthy instrumented animals. After baseline measurements, animals were randomized to receive either no treatment (n = 6) or continuous venovenous hemofiltration with a polysuphon membrane (CVVH, n = 5). Further data were collected at 6 and 10 hours after the randomization. During each time point the following data related to (1) organ perfusion (hepatosplanchnic and renal blood flows), (2) microcirculation (ileal mucosal and renal cortex laser Doppler flowmetry and sidestream darkfield imaging), (3) energy balance (arterial and regional pH, lactate/pyruvate and ketone body ratios), (4) oxidative/nitrosative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive species, nitrates + nitrites), (5) inflammation (TNFα, IL-6) and (6) endothelial dysfunction (von Willebrand factor, asymmetric dimethylarginine) were collected. Results Hemofiltration affected neither regional organ blood flows nor ileal mucosal and renal cortex microvascular perfusion. No changes in liver and kidney oxygen exchange and energy balance were detected during the 10-hour treatment. Similarly, CVVH did not interfere with surrogate markers of inflammation, oxidative/ nitrosative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Conclusions In our model CVVH utilizing a modern biocompatible polysulphon membrane did not induce any significant deleterious effects in various biological systems. The importance of our findings lies in the fact that any changes in the studied parameters, if observed in future studies, cannot be attributed to the effects of putative extracorporeal circuit bioincompatibility. Finally, our data support the postulated concept of good biological tolerance of CRRT. Acknowledgement Supported by MSM 0021620819 -Replacement of and support to some vital organs.

## Influence of continuous venovenous hemofiltration on transpulmonary thermodilution-derived parameters


## Introduction

The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dataset that needs to be specified when presenting pharmacokinetic data for critically ill patients with acute renal failure, and to review the current literature to establish whether this minimum Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Results None of the studies analysed presented the full dataset that we established as necessary ( Figure 1). Of concern, basic pharmacokinetic parameters such as the volume of distribution and clearance were absent in a significant number of studies effectively abrogating calculation of a meaningful dosing regimen.

Conclusions A large proportion of current studies do not report key information necessary to devise a rational dosing regimen for patients with acute renal failure receiving continuous renal replacement therapy. We have presented a set of criteria we believe are necessary to calculate an antibiotic-dosing regimen for these patients and hope this will be a useful guide when reporting future pharmacokinetic data. Introduction As a high proportion of patients who require continuous renal replacement therapy will also be receiving antibiotics, the issue of whether significant amounts of antibiotic are adsorbed by the haemofilter is relevant to critically ill patients. The aim of the study is to determine the time course of adsorption of gentamicin to a polyacrylonitrile filter (PAN) and a polyamide filter, respectively. Methods A unit of expired whole blood was mixed with heparinized lactated Ringer's solution to made up a total volume of 1,000 ml. Five hundred milliliters of this blood-crystalloid mixture was taken to a glass chamber where it was agitated and heated. After the equilibration period, 20% of a standard dose of the drug was infused into the mixing chamber. The blood-crystalloid mixture was then circulated through an in vitro continuous venovenous hemofiltration model. The ultrafiltrate was returned to the mixing chamber and no replacement fluid was infused. As a result, any decrease in drug concentration could only occur due to adsorption. Samples were taken from the mixing chamber for measurement of the drug concentration. At 90 minutes, the remaining 500 ml blood-crystalloid mixture will then be added to the mixing chamber. Samples were taken again after another hour. If the fall in drug concentration was less than those predicted from the dilution effect following the increase in blood-crystalloid volume, it indicates reversibility of adsorption. A second dose of drug was then added and samples were taken afterwards. Adsorption of antibiotic before and after the second dose was compared. Two types of filter, namely a 0.6 m 2 PAN hemofilter (Multiflow 100; Hospal) and a 0.6 m 2 polyamide hemofilter (Hemofilter 6S; Gambro), were used in the study and four batches of tests were repeated for each hemofilter. Results Drug adsorption by PAN hemofilters was significant, whereas drug adsorption by polyamide hemofilters was much lower compared with that of PAN hemofilters. Gentamicin adsorption by PAN hemofilters was completed at 30 minutes and it was irreversible.


## Conclusions

The adsorption properties of gentamicin by the two hemofilters were markedly different.  Introduction Ultrafiltration (UF) is effective and safe in treating volume-overloaded patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and diuretic resistance [1]. Accurate determination of the amount of fluid to be removed and maintenance of the circulating blood volume are critically important [2]. The inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) and its collapsibility index (IVCCI) are compromised in ADHF patients due to high right atrial pressure [3]. We hypothesized that monitoring of IVCCI could be used to optimize fluid removal rate during UF. Methods Twenty patients (nine male, 11 female; age 76 ± 4, New York Heart Association classes III to IV) admitted to our medical ICU for ADHF were treated with UF (Aquadex System 100; CHF Solutions, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and IVCD with M-mode subcostal echocardiography during spontaneous breathing were evaluated before UF (T0), at 12 hours (T1) and at 24 hours (T2). The IVCCI was calculated as follows: [(IVCD max -IVCD min ) / IVCD max ] x 100. Results The mean UF time was 25.5 ± 5 hours with a mean volume of 259 ml/hour and a total ultrafiltrate production of 6.6 ± 2 l. Differences between the T0 and T2 parameters are presented in Table 1. Hypotension was observed only in those patients (2/20) who reached IVCCI >35%. In all the other patients a significant increase in IVCCI was obtained without any hemodynamic instability. are correlated with increased mortality in septic shock acute renal failure (ARF) [1]. ARF treatment requires renal replacement therapy (RRT). The cytokine plasmatic level during and after hemodialysis (HD) in septic ARF is partially described [2]. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) hemodialyser membranes own high adsorptive capacity [3]. In this prospective observational trial, we study the plasmatic level of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 during and after the first HD seance with PMMA membrane in septic shock patients with ARF.

## Results

The mean total duration of NA infusion was 46 hours shorter in the adsorber group compared with the control group (95% CI = -104 hours to 12 hours, P = 0.165) ( Table 1). The average length of NA infusion was 17.4 ± 6.8 hours (5.8 to 23.8 hours) following the start of adsorption treatment. The level of LPS decreased in all but one study patient and all were without NA at 24 hours. The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment decrease was 3.4 ± 1.7 from baseline to 24 hours post treatment The average length of hospital stay was 3.4 days shorter in the adsorber group (95% CI of the difference, -21.7 to 14.8 days, P = 0.881). All study patients were alive on day 28 and one control died in the hospital. Conclusions Single 2-hour LPS hemoperfusion was associated with a rapid decrease in NA dose, reversal of septic shock, and decrease in organ dysfunctions and LPS concentrations. The total duration of NA infusion and hospital stay were shorter compared with historical controls, but the difference was not statistically significant in this small study.  


## Introduction

The aim of the study was to evaluate the first experience with endotoxin adsorption in complex intensive care of critically ill patients with sepsis after heart surgery. Methods Eleven adult patients were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: undergoing Alteco LPS adsorption procedures (n = 6), and undergoing hemoperfusion using Toraymyxin columns (n = 5). Intensive therapy of sepsis in both groups included antibacterial therapy, hemodynamic and respiratory support, prevention of thromboembolism, stress ulcer prophylaxis, nutritive support, and studied extracorporeal techniques to endotoxin removal (two procedures for every patient).

Results Endotoxin adsorption procedures were started on average at day 8 after surgery in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and confirmed Gram-negative infection. As the result of procedures, hemodynamic indices improved in both groups while the dose of inotropic support decreased. Also we noted the improvement of oxygenating lung function. Positive dynamics of procalcitonin, endotoxin and inflammation mediator concentrations were noted. A favorable influence of studied procedures on the course of the infective process was confirmed by the dynamics of leukocyte count and the tendency to normalization of body temperature. Blood cultures taken several days after the procedures were negative. There was no deterioration of hemodynamic indices during and after procedures. No cases of thrombosis of the extracorporeal contour were noted. Data are presented in Figure 1 as mean ± SEM. Conclusions Both studied procedures are safe. Clinical studies should be continued to define the place of endotoxin adsorption in complex treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis. Introduction Septic shock is a condition associated with diffuse coagulopathy and multiple organ failure, and frequently leads to death. Direct hemoperfusion using a polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (DHP-PMX) has been used for the treatment of septic shock [1]. On the other hand, there is another kind of acute blood purification therapy, but the optimal column of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is still controversial. Methods We treated 88 septic shock patients by DHP-PMX. The patients were divided into two groups based on the survival outcome and on the improvement in the circulatory dynamics immediately after DHP-PMX (Group A: increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) by more than 30 mmHg (44 cases); Group B: increase of SBP by 30 mmHg or less (44 cases)). In another study conducted to review the best choice of acute blood purification therapy after DHP-PMX, the patients were divided into three groups: groups undergoing CVVHDF using a polymethylmethacrylate membrane hemofilter (PMMA) (28 cases), CVVHDF using a polyacrylonitrile membrane hemofilter (26 cases), and no CVVHDF after DHP-PMX (34 cases). Results There were 48 survival cases and 40 expired cases. The overall survival rate was 54.5% (good outcome judging from the APACHE II score), and outcome significantly related to APACHE II score, Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score and blood lactic acid value before treatment (P <0.0001). The improvement rates of the blood pressure (increased by more than 30 mmHg) were 50.0% and significantly low blood lactic acid level in Group A. For another examination, only the PMMA CVVHDF group showed a better outcome (survival rate of 78.6%) compared with the other groups (P = 0.0190). In addition, only the PMMA CVVHDF group showed significant improvements of the blood lactic acid on day 3 (P = 0.0011).


## P282 Best choice of acute blood purification therapy based on the severity score and blood lactic acid values in septic


## Conclusions

Our study suggests that DHP-PMX treatment was effective in the early phase of septic shock before critical increase of the blood lactic acid levels. The optimal column for CVVHDF, as determined by improvement of the blood lactic acid levels, following DHP-PMX treatment is the PMMA column. S118 hundred and twenty-six septic patients who had severe sepsis or septic shock due to intra-abdominal infections were treated with PMX-DHP. Methods These patients were separated into two groups: whose who survived for at least 28 days after the start of PMX-DHP therapy (survival: 85 cases) and those who did not (nonsurvival: 41 cases). Background factors and inflammatory mediators were examined in each group. PMX-DHP was assessed with the changes of clinical parameters (heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and various cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1ra, PAI-1  Introduction Ultrasound is increasingly used to facilitate central venous catheter and regional anesthetic block placement [1,2]. Bacterial colonization of ultrasound probes has been demonstrated and the potential for cross-contamination between patients exists [3]. There are few, if any, studies investigating this for procedures performed by anesthesiologists, in the operating room and ICU. Methods Following Institutional Review Board approval, 18 ultrasound probes utilized by anesthesiologists were sampled after 1 week of average usage during 2 months in 2008. Standard microbiologic techniques were used [4]. Data were recorded, stored securely, and analyzed using appropriate statistics. Results Sixty-nine samples were obtained. Forty-nine percent of samples showed bacterial colonization. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus was identified in 42.6%. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus (1.4%) and Gram-negative bacteria (4.4%) was low.

Conclusions Ultrasound probes utilized in busy operating rooms and ICUs at a tertiary-care facility are a potential source for contamination and cross-contamination. Further studies of ultrasound use, probe contamination with the potential to serve as a vector for pathogens, and cleaning protocols are indicated. Introduction Although several precautions are taken or studies using national guidelines are conducted for preventing deviceassociated infections (DAI), it is still a big problem with high morbidity and mortality rates, related to frequent and long-term usage of invasive devices [1]. The aim of the study is to assess the incidence of DAI and to determine the microorganisms and resistance patterns of the pathogens. Methods All microbiological tests of DAI patients in the ICU between January 2007 and November 2008 were analyzed. All microorganisms isolated from patients were recorded and their resistance patterns were also ascertained. Results Sixty-nine patients were diagnosed as DAI using the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VIP) was the most frequent, with an incidence of 49.3% (n = 35), followed by catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CR-UTI) (n = 20) and central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CVC-BSI) (n = 15) with an incidence of 28.9% and 21.8%, respectively. The most frequent pathogens in VIP cases were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 57% of cases (80% of which were resistant to fluoroquinolones), enterobacteriaceae species in 22% of the cases (50% of which were resistant to ceftriaxone) and Staphylococcus aureus in 8% of the cases (100% of which were methicillin resistant). The most frequent pathogens in CR-UTI cases were enterobactericeae in 60% of cases (70% of which were resistant to ceftriaxone), enterococci species in 25% of the cases (none of the enterococci was resistant to vancomycine) and P. aeruginosa in 15% of cases (100% of which were resistant to flouroquinolones). The most frequent pathogens in CVC-BSI cases were coagulase-negative staphylococci in 66% of cases (75% of which were methicillin resistant), S. aureus in 20% of the cases (85% of which were resistant to methicilline) and enterobacteriaceae species in 14% of cases (30% of which were ceftriaxone).

Conclusions DAI increase the mortality and morbidity rates in the ICU. Therefore it is important to know the possible pathogen microorganisms and their resistance patterns for the success of the selection of the ampiric antibiotic treatment. Introduction Up to 20% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation for >48 hours will develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [1]. Dental plaque and oropharyngeal (OP) secretions of intubated patients often contain organisms capable of causing VAP [2]. Methods An intervention to improve oral hygiene (8-hourly OP cleaning/suctioning, toothbrushing and instillation of chlorhexidine gel) was commenced in one zone of an adult general ICU. Nursing staff in the rest of the ICU delivered standard oral hygiene (concurrent control). No other specific VAP prevention strategies were used in any patient. All patients on mechanical ventilation were reviewed daily for VAP using National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance criteria [3].

Results In a 4-month period, 71 patients were admitted to the intervention zone (Group A) and 189 patients were admitted to control beds (Group B). Table 1 summarises the results with values for age, APACHE II score and length of ICU stay shown as medians and interquartile ranges.

Conclusions Use of an intervention to improve oral hygiene was associated with a reduction in the incidence of VAP. 


## Introduction

The objective was to determine the frequency of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients and its role as a risk factor for ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) that may be enhanced among these patients.


## Methods

The study was conducted in a pediatric ICU of Ain Shams University Hospital on 24 mechanically ventilated patients (16 VAP patients and eight without VAP as controls, with mean age 16.6 ± 20.5 and 18.6 ± 22.4 months, respectively). Esophageal 24 hour pH-metry beside clinical and laboratory evaluation of the underlying problem and severity of the patient's condition were carried out. Results All VAP patients had GER (50% alkaline reflux, 12.5% acidic reflux and 37.5% combined reflux) compared with 75% of non-VAP patients (100% alkaline reflux). The total reflux time was found to be significantly longer among VAP (50 minutes) versus non-VAP (3 minutes) patients. There was a significant increase in acidic reflux parameters among nonsurvivors versus survivors (P <0.001).

Conclusions GER is a constant incident in our mechanically ventilated pediatric patients, with alkaline reflux being more common than acidic reflux. Both acidic reflux and alkaline reflux Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Aspiration of subglottic secretions is recommended by the American Thoracic Society, for the prevention of ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) [1], but has a poor implementation rate in some countries [2]. VAP is the most frequent infection in ventilated patients, occurring in up to 27% of cases [1]. Introduction Nosocomial pneumonia is the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent ICU-acquired infection in mechanically ventilated patients. The purpose of our study is to assess the prevalence and the etiologic pathogens of VAP in our ICU, as well as its impact on morbidity and mortality. Methods A prospective observational study in a multidisciplinary eight-bed ICU. During an 18-month period, 160 consecutive patients with a length of stay (LOS) ≥48 hours were enrolled in the study. Data were collected using a specially designed software and included age, gender, APACHE II score on admission, days on mechanical ventilation, LOS and ICU outcome. Patients were stratified into two groups: Group A included patients who did not develop VAP (n = 144), and Group B patients in whom VAP diagnosis was confirmed (n = 16). In Group B, isolated pathogens and their in vitro susceptibilities were also recorded. VAP diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical criteria and positive quantitative cultures of bronchial aspirates (≥10 5 colonyforming units/ml). Data were analyzed using Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Results Age (64 ± 18 vs. 70 ± 13 years, P = 0.257) and APACHE II score on admission (18.9 ± 7.6 vs. 18.8 ± 9.7, P = 0.965) were similar in both groups. Calculated VAP incidence was 5.87/1,000 ventilator-days (four early and 12 late-onset VAP). Duration of mechanical ventilation (17 ± 22 vs. 30 ± 12 days, P < 0.001) and LOS (19 ± 22 vs. 34 ± 15 days, P <0.001) were statistically longer in Group B. Isolated pathogens included: Acinetobacter baumannii (10 patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (four patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients), other Gram-negative (one patient). Overall antibiotic resistance to carbapenemes was 88%, to aminoglycosides 82%, to aztreonam 94%, to piperacillin/ tazobactam 82% and to colimycin 6%. ICU mortality was considerably higher in Group B (24.3% vs. 43.8%). Conclusions All VAP cases in our ICU were caused by Gramnegative multidrug-resistant bacteria. Colimycin seems to be our major therapeutic weapon against these strains. VAP prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation and LOS, and contributes to higher mortality rates in ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Introduction Surveillance of hospital-acquired infections in intensive care wards is a very important but time-consuming process requiring involvement of all medical personnel [1]. This means published data on infections after cardiac surgery are rather limited [2]. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiology and etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) following coronary surgery in ICU patients. Methods The surveillance was based on the active method. Cases of infections were detected by the hospital Infection Control Team in cooperation with the unit personnel in accordance with Centers for Disease Control definitions during 2007. Data on surgical site infections (SSI; 33 cases) served as the background for validation of VAP surveillance. Results Altogether 53 VAP cases after 2,170 surgical events were detected. The ventilator utilization ratio was 0.52. The total cumulative VAP incidence rate was 2.2% and the ventilatorassociated hospital-acquired pneumonia rate was 18.3/1,000 ventilator-days; mortality was 1.9%. The total cumulative incidence SSI rate was 1.4%. Etiological factors of VAP were Gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa -10.4%, Escherichia coli -12.5%, Klebsiella pneumoniae -16.7%) and Candida albicans. Conclusions In the analyzed setting, in which surveillance of SSI has been run since 2002, detected SSI incidence rates are similar to those reported in the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance and Krankenhaus Infectionen Surveillance System programs [3,4]. However, obtained data on the epidemiology of VAP are different. Also, there are differences in both the epidemiology and microbiology of VAP in this hospital and results reported from other cardiac surgery wards. This indicates a necessity for introducing effective surveillance of hospital-acquired pneumonia after cardiac surgery procedures in the ICU. Acknowledgement Partially financed by K/ZDS/000649.


## Introduction

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent ICU-acquired infection among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. The aim of our study was to test the incidence, the rate of mortality and the impact of VAP to prolong the duration of ICU stay, in our both medical and surgical ICU. Methods During a 32-month period, from November 2005 to August 2008, 127 patients were admitted to our ICU; 114 of them had received mechanical ventilation and were included retrospectively in our study. The sum of the mechanical ventilation days was 1,330. The patients compared were divided into two groups. Group A included 28 patients (24.5% of the total) with VAP (five early and 23 late), and Group B included 86 patients with no VAP. Results The incidence of VAP was 24.5% in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, or 21 of episodes per 1,000 days of mechanical ventilation. We detected no statistically significant difference among the two groups according to age (mean ± SD): 64.62 ± 15.9 and 64.53 ± 16.9, P = 0.97, nor the APACHE II score (mean ± SD): 19.96 ± 6.8 and 19.33 ± 7.79, P = 0.7. We detected a statistically significant difference among the two groups according to the duration of ICU stay (days, mean ± SD): 33.75 ± 20 and 10.27 ± 11.29, P <0.0001. We detected a difference according to the rate of mortality, 32.14% and 22.09%, respectively, although not statistically significant, P = 0.31, OR = 1.67. Conclusions The incidence of VAP in our study is similar to other studies, which varies from 8% to 28%. VAP prolongs the duration of ICU stay, while the attributable mortality rate for VAP is still debated. Nevertheless, we have to improve our clinical approach in order to recognize better the risk factors and to develop a more effective prevention program. S124 cells. Differences in CC-10 concentrations have been demonstrated in several inflammatory lung diseases (for example, bronchial asthma and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia). Moreover, there is evidence that in infectious pulmonary diseases the type of microorganism (for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) influences CC-10 activity. In this study we evaluated the presence of CC-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as a potential marker for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients with a suspicion of VAP. The first hMPV-positive patient had an underlying hematological malignancy (multiple myeloma). Already being treated with broadspectrum antibiotics, the patient developed signs of respiratory distress. Five days after hospital admission, the patient was admitted to the ICU because of respiratory insufficiency. A BAL performed the same day yielded no causative microorganism at that time. The second hMPV-positive patient had been admitted to the hospital with a community-acquired pneumonia for which no causative organism was identified. Five days after hospital admission, progressive respiratory insufficiency necessitated ICU admission. Twelve days after ICU admittance a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, which yielded Candida albicans in 10 2 colony-forming units/ml. In both patients no causative microorganism for pneumonia could be identified during hospitalisation, and therefore we speculate that hMPV may at least have contributed to or perhaps even caused the respiratory deterioration under antibiotic therapy. Conclusions In critically ill patients 1.4% of collected BALF samples revealed the presence of hMPV RNA. Therefore, hMPV may play a part in respiratory complications in ICU patients. An additional study is necessary to investigate the extent to which hMPV contributes to respiratory failure in patients admitted to the ICU. Conclusions Significantly (P <0.05) increasing resistance rates (I+R%) and increasing MICs (2log MIC) were found among P. aeruginosa to carbapenems and ceftazidime. For other speciesantibiotic combinations there were either low (<1%) resistance rates or not the same significant changes demonstrated with the two trend models. This study showed that trend analysis based on MIC distributions was not more sensitive than trend analysis based Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine S125 on changes in susceptibility (I+R). High (>27%) resistance rates were seen for all tested drugs against P. aeruginosa while low (<1%) resistance rates were only shown for carbapenems against E. coli and K. pneumoniae.

## P302 Trend analysis of antibiotic resistance and minimum inhibitory concentration distribution from 1997 to 2007 among Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in European ICUs

Introduction Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains one of the most important pathogens in the nosocomial setting, where it is a common causative agent of bacteremia [1,2]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of Pseudomonas spp. strains isolated from inpatients hospitalized in the ICU of our hospital throughout a 3-year period. Methods A total of 175 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas spp. collected from January 2006 to December 2008 were investigated in this study. Each isolate was obtained from a different patient. Identification and routine antibiograms of the isolates were carried out using the Vitek 2 automated System (BioMerieux ® , Marcy I'Etolie, France). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of imipenem, meropenem and colistin were also determined by the agar dilution method according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.


## Results

The isolates included in our study originated from blood cultures 70 (40%), urine 53 (30.3%), bronchial aspirates 23 (13.1%), central venous catheters 18 (10.3%) and others 11 (6.3%). The resistance rates changed from 2006 to 2008 as follows: amikacin: 72 to 83%, aztreonam: 90 to 95%, ceftazidime: 81 to 89%, ciprofloxacin: 79 to 85%, colistin: 0 to 0%, meropenem: 72 to 83%, imipenem: 72 to 83%, netilmicin: 72 to 83%, piperacillin/tazobactam: 71 to 80%, tobramycin: 72 to 83%, ticarcillinlin/clavulanic acid: 71 to 80%. Conclusions Pseudomonas spp. infections are particularly serious for incubated ICU patients with 40 to 50% mortality rates. In our hospital, the percentage of Pseudomonas spp. multiresistant isolates has increased dramatically over the past 3 years. The majority of isolates were resistant to 15 or more antibiotics. What is most worrying is the fact that there is a prevalence of a multiresistant phenotype that was only sensitive to colistin. The emergance and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas spp. are of great concern worldwide. It is necessary to limit the overuse of antibiotics and to implement a new antibiotic policy.  Introduction Staphylococcus aureus is a potential pathogenic microorganism and a causative agent of ~25% of infections in intensive care patients. Optimal empiric therapy may reduce morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is essential to provide the clinician with resistance data of the local circulating strains and patients pathogens. A national surveillance program of the Dutch Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Group was started in the Netherlands in 1996 to gain insight into the emergence of microbial resistance at local, regional and national levels. This study describes the findings of resistance development of S. aureus from ICUs of 14 large referral hospitals all over the Netherlands over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006. Methods In the first 6 months of each year, the participating hospitals collected clinical isolates from, among others, blood and respiratory samples. In total 943 isolates were collected: 250 from three hospitals in the north, 187 from two in the east, 229 from five in the west and 280 from four in the south. The susceptibility to relevant antibiotics was determined by micro broth dilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Results Resistance to penicillin fluctuated over time at ~75%; seven methicillin-resistant S. aureus were isolated (0.7%). Resistance to clarithromycin increased to 10% in 2003, but decreased in 2006 to 6%, the level before 2003. Resistance to clindamycin fluctuated over time from 4 to 8%. Doxycyclin resistance varied between 2 and 10%. No resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid was demonstrated. Resistance to gentamicin and rifampicin was sporadically found. The prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance was between 0 and 4% until 2002.

In 2003, a peak in the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance (ciprofloxacin 14% and moxifloxacin 8%) was observed. Resistance to ciprofloxacin remained at this high level until 2005 and decreased in 2006. Resistance to moxifloxacin decreased immediately. Regional differences were observed for ciprofloxacin, with the highest resistance in the western and southern parts and with doxycyclin with the lowest resistance rate in the northern part.

Conclusions During the 10-year study period only an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. The data presented still justify the empiric choice of flucloxacillin (with rifampicin or gentamicin depending on the indication) in case of an infection probably caused by S. aureus in ICU patients. Mann-Whitney test, unpaired t test and chi-squared test were used accordingly; P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 65 patients were enrolled and randomized in the continuous (n = 33) and intermittent (n = 32) groups. No significant differences between both groups in all assessed parameters were found. Clinically evaluated failure of therapy in the continuous versus intermittent groups was in 12 (36%) patients versus eight (25%) patients, and microbiological failure in seven (21%) patients versus eight (25%) patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 24-hour creatinine clearance (CrCL) higher than 130 ml/min/1.73 m 2 on vancomycin serum levels, and to identify an accurate marker of this condition. Methods This study was carried out in a multipurpose ICU, on 120 critical septic patients, 36% with septic shock (42 patients), 67 men (72.5%), average age 56 ± 21 years, average APACHE II score and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 17.2 and 42.2, respectively. We studied 120 consecutive vancomycin treatments (continuous perfusion) and we assessed therapeutic levels (20 to 30 μg/ml) on days 1, 2 and 3 (V1, V2 and V3). Patients were divided into two groups according to CrCL: G1 ≤130 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (n = 77); G2 >130 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (n = 43  Introduction Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have been recognised as microorganisms capable of causing epidemics in critically ill patients [1]. The present report describes an outbreak involving VRE colonisation in our ICU. Methods After several weeks of severe nursing shortage, when often there were only three nurses for 10 critically ill patients, the first VRE was isolated from one of the two blood cultures of a trauma patient. Rectal swabs of all of the patients' and ICU staff were collected. Because there was no patient who had been discharged to the ward during this period no further analysis was required.

Results Enterococcus casseliflavus was isolated from six out of the 10 patients' rectal swabs. Once the outbreak was identified, all patients were placed under strict contact isolation and cohorted, and barrier precautions were instituted. Four patients who had negative rectal swabs were isolated in another ICU. Five of the patients did not demonstrate signs of infection and were accepted as colonisation. ICU staff had negative rectal swabs. Two of the patients who had positive rectal swabs had died because of underlying primary disease (acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome due to aspiration pneumonia). The first patient who had a positive blood culture was treated with intravenous Linezolid and discharged to home after 14 days. Another patient who had sepsis due to necrotising fasciitis was discharged to the ward after obtaining three negative rectal swabs. The other patient who had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and pneumonia was discharged to the ward after obtaining three negative rectal swabs. The last patient was isolated in another room and followed up for 4 weeks and discharged to the ward after obtaining three negative rectal swabs.

## P310 Telavancin for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia in severely ill and older patients: the ATTAIN studies

Introduction Telavancin (TLV) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with activity against Gram-positive pathogens. The Assessment of Telavancin for Treatment of Hospital-acquired Pneumonia (ATTAIN) programme studied TLV for the treatment of hospitalacquired pneumonia (HAP). This analysis compared the clinical cure rates achieved with TLV or vancomycin (VAN) for severely ill and older patients. Methods ATTAIN 1 and ATTAIN 2 were methodologically identical, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 studies. Adult patients with pneumonia acquired after 48 hours in an inpatient acute-care or chronic-care facility, or acquired within 7 days after being discharged following ≥3 days of hospital stay were randomised to TLV 10 mg/kg intravenously every 24 hours or VAN 1 g intravenously every 12 hours for 7 to 21 days. A test-of-cure (TOC) visit was conducted 7 to 14 days after end-of-study treatment. Compliant patients who had a clinical response of either cure or failure at TOC were considered clinically evaluable (CE).

Results Pooled clinical cure rates at TOC for several clinically relevant subgroups including the elderly as well as patients with severe HAP at baseline are presented in Figure 1. The percentage of patients reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was comparable between the TLV and VAN groups (80% vs. 79%, respectively). Conclusions Although not statistically significant, TLV achieved numerically higher cure rates than VAN for treatment of HAP in severely ill and older patients with comparable treatment-emergent adverse events.  S129 antiseptic-impregnated catheter for short-term catheterization and recommend avoiding femoral access to reduce the risk of central venous catheter-related bacteremia (CVC-RB). The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of CVC-RB with rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters (RM-C) and standard catheters (S-C) in femoral venous access; and the cost of CVC-RB with both types of catheter. Methods A cohort study, conducted in a 24-bed polyvalent medical-surgical ICU of a university hospital. We included patients admitted to the ICU from 1 June 2006 to 30 September 2007, who underwent femoral venous catheterization. The cost of CVC-RB included the cost of antimicrobial agents and the diagnosis methods; but other costs were not included (such as prolongation of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, extrarenal depuration, etc.).


## Introduction


## Results

We inserted 73 RM-C during 634 catheter-days and 111 S-C during 927 catheter-days. We diagnosed eight CVC-RB in the S-C group and none in the RM-C group. The incidence of CVC-RB with RM-C was significantly lower than with S-C (0 vs. 8.62 per 1,000 catheter-days, OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.00 to 0.86; P = 0.03). The total cost in the RM-C group was €7,300 (73 central venous catheters (CVC) per €100 each CVC, and none CVC-RB), the mean cost per catheter was €100 (€7,300/73 CVC), and the mean cost per catheter-day was €11.51 (€7,300/634 CVC-days). The total cost in the S-C group was €15,330 (111 CVC per €30 each CVC = €3,330, more than €12,000 per the eight CVC-RB), the mean cost per catheter was €138 (€15,330/111 CVC), and the mean cost per catheter-day was €16.54 (€15,330/927 CVC-days).

Conclusions RM-C could decrease the incidence of femoral venous catheter-related bacteremia and are more efficient than standard catheters. Introduction Pediatric patients in the ICU are highly vulnerable to invasive fungal infections [1]; Candida has been reported to be the third most common pathogen in pediatric ICU wards [2]. However, information on new antifungal therapies in children remains limited. Micafungin (MICA) is a once-daily antifungal agent of the echinocandin class. Methods A retrospective review of MICA pediatric data from six trials. Results MICA was received by 296 children for invasive candidiasis, refractory invasive candidiasis, refractory invasive aspergillosis, prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients, or to assess pharmacokinetics (PK). Most patients aged <1 year were premature (38/66), whereas most children aged >1 year were HSCT recipients or undergoing another therapy for a hematological malignancy (181/230). Maximum daily dose was similar for patients aged <1, 1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12 and 13 to 15 years with medians of 2.0, 1.5, 1.5, 1.9 and 1.5 mg/kg, respectively. Treatment success rates are shown in Figure 1. MICA showed linear PK, with a higher clearance in neonates than in older children and adults. Common adverse events (incidence ≥2%) were transient increases in transaminases, hypokalemia, hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase.

## Micafungin for the treatment of pediatric invasive fungal infections

Introduction Rickettsia conorii infection, the agent of Boutonneuse fever, presents usually in a form considered benign, with serious complications in less than 10% of patients. Its mechanism of infection consists of vascular endothelial invasion by the microorganism and subsequent vasculitis and tissue necrosis. The process is usually localized or limited to the skin but can progress with malignant severe systemic involvement [1,2]. Methods A series of three cases of patients with multiple organ failure admitted to an ICU with confirmed diagnosis of Boutonneuse fever is presented (positive serology or tissue PCR). Results Common to all the patients was the rapid development of the disease (average: 3 days) from the initial complaints of fever after a bite by an unidentified agent and development of generalized rash, and the diagnosis of multiple organ failure (average Simplified Acute Physiology Score II: 59; average Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on admission: 12.6). All developed respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, haematological failure with haemolytic anaemia and acute renal failure suggestive of serious widespread vasculitis. One of the cases developed lethal refractory septic shock within 6 hours of admission. Tetracycline antibiotic therapy was started early in all patients, based on clinical and epidemiological data, since initial microbiological results were negative. Conclusions This series of cases illustrates the most severe form of Boutonneuse fever, usually associated with comorbidities such as diabetes, malignant disease, immunodeficiency or delay in the diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy, which was not the case in these patients.

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Appropriate intravenous, broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as rapidly as possible for suspected severe infections in the presence of hypotension. Timing and delay of initial administration of effective antimicrobial therapy is an important predictor of survival [1]. It is hypothesized that appropriate prehospital-initiated intravenous, broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy will reduce the delay of administration and will reduce mortality [2]. Methods One hundred and ninety-eight patients meeting the criteria for septic shock on initial clinical presentation prehospital were randomized to receiving broad-spectrum intravenous antimicrobial therapy and fluid per guided protocol or to receiving intravenous fluid only. Results Out of 198 septic shock patients, 99 received prehospital antimicrobial therapy. Blood cultures were taken prior to administration. Both groups were comparable in all aspects. There were 83 male and 26 female patients in the test group, and 79 male and 20 female patients in the control group (P = 0.021). Mean age was 67.9 ± 10.5 years in the test group and 63.8 ± 11.0 years in the control group (P = 0.186). The APACHE II score in the test group and in the control group was statistically not significant (P = 0.661). In the test group 28%, compared with the control group 53%, of patients had community-acquired pneumonia (P = 0.083). The mean intensive care stay in the test group was 6.8 ± 2.1 days and in the control group it was 11.2 ± 5.2 days (P = 0.001). The first antimicrobial administration after emergency department admission time in the control group was 3.4 ± 2.6 hours (P = 0.02). The 28-day mortality rate was significantly reduced to 42.4% (test group) compared with 56.7% in the control group (P = 0.049, OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.32 to 1.00). Conclusions The adjuvant treatment of patients with a guided prehospital-initiated broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy with intravenous fluid reduces the delay in antimicrobial administration and significantly reduces the 28-day mortality rate in patients with septic shock. Results Fifteen patients were identified, 13 men and two women. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 65 years. The patients were admitted to intensive care for polytrauma (10 cases), chest trauma (three cases) and cerebrovascular accident (two cases). The main infections were ventilator nosocomial pneumonia (100%), surgical site infection (6.6%), primary bacteremia (13%), catheter infection (20%), and meningitis (13%). The bacteria responsible were A. baumanii (100%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (46%), Staphylo-coccus aureus (26%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (6%), and Morganella morganii (6%). All patients had normal renal function at the onset of antibiotic therapy. Five patients received colistin monotherapy, six patients received combination therapy colistin with imipenem or third-generation cephalosporin, and four patients received colistin with teicoplanine. The colistin was used at 4 mg/kg/day administered intravenously and aerolized colistin at 2 mg/kg for 8 to 16 days. A favourable response was observed in 12 cases. Overall mortality was three cases. Colistin induced reversible nephrotoxicity in one case and a reversible neuropsychiatric event was observed in one case. Bacterial eradication was confirmed in 14 patients (93%).

Conclusions Garnacho-Montero and colleagues reported that intravenous colistin was as effective as imipenem [1]. Our findings with colistin can be considered encouraging in comparison with previous experience. Introduction Aminoglycosides, especially gentamicin, are extensively used for treatment of severe infections. A dose of 7 mg/kg is recommended to achieve a high peak serum concentration. However, its accumulation is associated with adverse reactions, notably renal injury. Knowledge of gentamicin pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients is therefore crucial to therapeutic success and prevention of toxicity. Methods Patients' demographic and clinical data were collected. We studied gentamicin pharmacokinetic data from patients treated between January 2006 and June 2008 in two ICUs. Patients were eligible if the gentamicin dose was selected to achieve high serum levels (target concentration of 16 to 24 μg/ml) and if pharmacokinetic data from such patients, specifically peak and trough levels, were measured after the first dose. The Sawchuk and Zaske onecompartment pharmacokinetic model [1] was used to calculate the gentamicin volume of distribution (Vd), maximum concentration (Cmax) and clearance.


## Results

We studied 32 patients with a mean age of 63 years (24 men). Mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 7.65 and the mean Charlson comorbidities score was 3.54. The median Vd was 0.41 l/kg (IQR 0.36 to 0.46 l/kg). Only four patients had a Vd equal to or less than 0.26 l/kg, usually found in the healthy population. We found no correlation between Vd and age, Charlson comorbidities score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and creatinine serum level (r 2 = 0.016, 0.18, 0.037, and 0.067, respectively). The presence of mechanical ventilation and septic shock had no influence on Vd (P = 0.59 and P = 0.14, respectively). Women had a significantly higher mean Vd/kg (0.51 vs. 0.39 l/kg, P = 0.002) and, therefore, lower Cmax (15.2 vs. 18.5 μg/ml, P = 0.016). In a logistic regression model, only sex (female: OR = 0.032; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.387) and the dose/kg (per mg/kg: OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 1.17 to 8.79) were significantly associated with the achievement of Cmax above 16 μg/ml.


## Conclusions

The gentamicin Vd cannot be predicted by age, the presence of renal failure or any studied comorbidities. Therefore, in order to obtain adequate therapeutic levels as soon as possible, a high first gentamicin dose (that is, at least 7 mg/kg) should be given to all patients. In women, even higher doses may be needed. recommends starting appropriate antibiotic therapy within 1 hour after making the diagnosis of septic shock. In the ICU of our emergency center, we perform empiric antibiotic therapy for septic shock patients within 6 hours after admission. Methods Cases of severe sepsis or septic shock diagnosed and treated in the ICU of our emergency center for more than 48 hours between January 2005 and September 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. The cases were divided into a survival group and a nonsurvival group, and were compared in relation to primary diagnosis, clinical findings, and type of pathogen. The chi-square test and paired t test were used to perform the statistical analysis. Results There were 107 cases, 24 cases of severe sepsis and 83 cases of septic shock, and 73 of them were in males. The mean and standard deviation of the patients' age was 66.4 ± 15 years. The severity of their illness according to the APACHE II score was 22.3 ± 8, and their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 9.1 ± 4. The causes of the sepsis were pneumonia (51.4%), peritonitis (13.1%), and soft tissue infection (13.1%). Mortality was 26.2%. There were 79 cases in the survival group and 28 in the nonsurvival group. The two groups are presented in Table 1. We performed a multivariate regression analysis to identify prognostic factors, and the only independent prognostic factors were age (OR = 0.955 (P = 0.022; 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.99)), acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) (OR = 5.789 (P = 0.002; 95% CI = 1.91 to 17.4)) and base deficit (OR = 1.113 (P = 0.008; 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.2)). Early appropriate antibiotic therapy (EAAT) was not correlated with survival. 


## S133

Recently, it was revealed through our animal models that intravenous administration of freeze-dried sulfonated human normal immunoglobulin (IVIG) makes anti-inflammatory effects by enhancing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production through stimulation of sensory nerves, which inhibits the production of TNF.

In this study, we examined whether IVIG for septic patients enhances IGF-1 production. Methods Fourteen septic patients indicating a high level of soluble E-selectin were surveyed, who were transported to our hospital from April to November 2007. They were divided into two groups, IVIG group (G-group, 5 g/day x 3 days, nine cases, 67.2 ± 8.64 years old) and nonadministered group (control group, C-group, five cases, 69 ± 12.9 years old).


## Results

In the G-group, the values of IGF-1 on the fifth day (162.22 ± 52.91 ng/ml) and seventh day (150.44 ± 29.06 ng/ml) were significantly higher than that on day 0 (88.59 ± 29.79 ng/ml, P <0.05). Furthermore, The value of IGF-1 of the G-group (162.22 ± 52.91 ng/ml) was significantly higher than that of the Cgroup (68.80 ± 24.04 ng/ml) on the fifth day (P <0.05).

Conclusions We revealed that IVIG for septic patients enhances IGF-1 production. Furthermore we will enhance the effect of sulfanated immunoglobulin compared with that of intact immunoglobulin in the difference of the anti-inflammatory effect and the mechanism.

Introduction In the CORTICUS study, despite the fact that the median time to shock reversal was shorter in the hydrocortisone (HC) group, improvement of outcome was not demonstrated. This is explained as an increased incidence of superinfection, including new episodes of sepsis or septic shock, but the explanation seems to be unclear so there are still debates about the study. We examined the outcome of HC therapy and the effect on later infectious complications, especially fungal infection. , HC was given only to patients that were poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. We assessed the 28-day and 90-day survival rate, hospital discharge rate, the incidence of new septic shock, the positive rate of endotoxin and β-D-glucan. Results Out of 96 patients, 38 patients were determined as responders and 58 as nonresponders. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was higher in nonresponders (11 ± 3.3 vs. 13.6 ± 3.7, P = 0.0014). For the 58 nonresponders, HC was used for 40 patients (HC group). The 28-day survival rate was higher in HC (61% vs. non-HC 44%, P = 0.49), but the 90-day survival rate decreased to 33% in HC and 28% in non-HC (P = 0.47), and the discharge rate reversed as 25% in HC versus 28% in non-HC (P = 0.84). The incidence of new septic shock was 20% in HC, 11% in non-HC. The positive rate of endotoxin did not increase before and after treatment in both groups. The mean concentration of β-D-glucan did not increase in non-HC (59 ± 99 to 48 ± 44 pg/ml), but it significantly increased in HC (50 ± 70 to 69 ± 186 pg/ml) (P = 0.049). Conclusions The 28-day survival rate was higher in the HC group than the non-HC group as reported in the French study, but no beneficial effect was seen in longer outcome, consistent with the CORTICUS study. Moreover, HC therapy may have a risk to increase fungal infection.

Effects of methylprednisolone on sepsis-induced blood-brain barrier permeability and reflex responsiveness in rats 


## Introduction

The purpose of this study was to assess neurological function and examine blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes in septic encephalopathy after cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). The protective effect of high-dose methylprednisolone administration on BBB derangement and neurological dysfunction was also investigated.

Methods An experimental prospective randomized study was performed on 42 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Sepsis was induced through CLP. A bolus 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone administration followed by intravenous injection of 5.4 mg/kg/hour for 8 hours was given immediately after CLP in septic and shamoperated rats. Control groups for both septic and sham-operated rats were injected with equal volumes of saline.

Results Neurological function was assessed at 8, 12, and 24 hours after sepsis induction. Those rats surviving for 24 hours post procedure were anesthetized and decapitated for investigation of BBB integrity using a spectrophotometric assay of Evans blue dye extravasations. A significant decrease in neurological function and a significant increase in BBB permeability were observed with the induction of sepsis compared with the sham-operated controls. Administration of methylprednisolone caused a significantly improved reflex responsiveness and decreased brain tissue Evans blue dye content in septic rats.


## Conclusions

The present investigation shows that methylprednisolone administered immediately after sepsis induction via CLP is associated with better neurologic scores, which might be related to its positive effects on sepsis-induced BBB permeability changes. Introduction Mechanical ventilation (MV) may evoke damage to healthy lungs leading to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). We hypothesized that downregulation of pulmonary inflammation may attenuate VILI. The present study investigated whether lung inflammation and injury can be restored by dexamethasone (Dex). To prevent the systemic negative side effects of free Dex, we targeted Dex by delivering anti-E-selectin Dex liposomes into activated endothelium of inflamed lungs. Methods Mice were tracheotomized and ventilated in the pressure control mode for 5 hours with 50% oxygen levels, 2 cmH 2 O positive end-expiratory pressure and 12 cmH 2 O peak inspiratory pressure (lung protective, LP-MV) or 20 cmH 2 O peak inspiratory pressure (lung injurious, LI-MV). Nonventilated mice were used as controls. Free Dex, anti-E-selectin or isotype IgG Dex liposomes were given systemically at initiation of MV. After 5 hours, lung injury was determined by arterial oxygen levels, tissue edema and bronchoalveolar lavage protein levels. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed by myeloperoxidase activity and IL-1β, keratinocytederived chemokine and E-selectin mRNA.


## P327 Systemic administration of E-selectin-directed dexamethasone liposomes attenuates pulmonary inflammation in a mouse model of ventilator-induced lung injury

Results LI-MV decreased oxygenation levels, increased tissue edema and increased bronchoalveolar lavage protein levels as compared with LP-MV, suggesting that lung function was deteriorated by LI-MV. Both MV strategies enhanced pulmonary inflammation. Anti-E-selectin Dex liposomes and free Dex, but also IgG Dex liposomes, reduced ventilator-induced lung inflammation. However, Dex treatment did not diminish lung injury.

Conclusions Systemic administration of targeted and free Dex attenuates VILI-associated pulmonary inflammation, but not lung injury.


## Introduction

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors for relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) patients and the impact on postoperative hemodynamic status. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed on elective CPB patients on a 24-bed ICU of a tertiary university hospital. RAI was defined as a rise in serum cortisol ≤9 μg/dl after the administration of 250 μg cosyntropin. Plasma cortisol levels were measured preoperatively, immediately before and 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes after the administration of cosyntropin (250 μg).


## Results

We included 120 from 137 consecutive patients, of whom 17 met criteria for exclusion (eight off-pump, two surgical emergencies, two with endocarditis, five corticoid dependency). We studied 84 (70%) males and 36 (30%) females. Mean age 67 ± 12 years. Plasma cortisol levels were measured preoperatively, immediately before, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the administration of cosyntropin and at 24 postoperative hours. The RAI (Δcortisol ≤9 μg/dl) incidence was 77.5%. Etomidate was the only independent risk factor associated with RAI (OR = 8.51, 95% CI Introduction Although critical-illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) is common in septic shock patients, its diagnosis and management remain controversial [1,2]. The recent consensus conference on CIRCI reported that baseline total serum cortisol and that after 250 μg synthetic ACTH is insufficient to evaluate the adrenal response to sepsis [1]. To our knowledge, there is no CT-scan study that has evaluated adrenal gland imaging during septic shock. The aim of our study was to describe the adrenal gland volume evaluated by CT scan during septic shock. Methods A single-center study during 1 year. Two groups of patients who benefited from an abdominal CT scan were studied. Patients who presented septic shock, an ACTH test and an abdominal CT scan in the 72 hours before or after the onset of shock were included in the group septic shock (shock +). Patients who benefited from an abdominal CT scan but did not present any shock were included in the group nonshock (shock -). CIRCI was defined as a delta serum total cortisol less than 9 μg/dl after an ACTH test of 250 μg. The main endpoint was the total adrenal gland volume evaluated by CT scan with semiautomatic software (Myriane Intrasense, Montpellier, France).


## Results

In the preliminary results we compared 66 patients in septic shock with 20 patients without any shock. In the septic shock group, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score was 46 (40 to 56) and mortality in the ICU was 36%. The total adrenal gland volume is presented in Table 1. The ACTH test was not evaluable in four patients in the group septic shock leading us to analyse 62 patients.


## Conclusions

Our preliminary results showed for the first time that in septic shock the total adrenal gland volume is three to four times higher than in nonseptic patients. The diagnosis and outcome impact of this increase volume should be better evaluated. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Response to the ACTH test did not influence the adrenal volume. *P <0.05. S136 from day 1 to day 7 (1.447; 1.103 to 1.898) were associated with an increased 3-month survival. But systemic steroids did not improve 28-day and 3-month survival. Conclusions The effects of systemic steroids in patients with severe CAP requiring mechanical ventilation in the MICU did not improve survival.

Introduction Several studies, largely retrospective, have suggested improved outcomes and a reduction in inflammatory response in patients who develop infection whilst on statin therapy. This study reports outcomes for patients on established statin therapy admitted to hospital with presumed infection compared with those patients not on a statin. Methods The study was approved by the Princess Alexandra Hospital Research Ethics Committee and conducted from May 2006 to October 2008 as part of a randomised controlled study investigating continuing established statin therapy. A daily computer-generated report identified all patients admitted to hospital with a potential diagnosis of infection. Results From a total of 2,291 patients screened, 2,239 were considered to have presumed infection. Of these, 2,161 were aged >30 years and were included in the final analysis (statin users = 633, no statin use = 1,528). The statin group was significantly older with a mean age (± SD) of 69 ± 12 versus 61 ± 16 years (P = 0.0001) and included more men (62.1% vs. 55.2%, P = 0.004). The source of presumed infection was not statistically different between the groups (overall chi-square P = 0.16). A presumed respiratory source was the most common in both groups (statin 35.5% vs. no statin 37.1%, respectively) followed by skin (19.0 vs. 20.3%), gastrointestinal (17.8 vs. 14.1%), urosepsis (13.0 vs. 11.7%) and other sources (14.7 vs. 16.8%). Two or more SIRS criteria was seen in 65.4% of the statin group patients and 67.8% of the no statin group (P = 0.30). Hospital mortality was similar in both groups (7.4% statin group and 6.5% no statin group, P = 0.64), as was the rate of ICU admission (17% statin group and 16% no statin group; P = 0.63). Hospital length of stay was not significantly different between the groups (11.4 ± 15.4 days in the statin group and 12.5 ± 26.2 days in the no statin group, P = 0.10). Conclusions In a heterogeneous cohort of patients admitted to hospital with presumed infection, prior statin therapy was not associated with an improved outcome or reduced systemic inflammatory response. The age and gender differences observed are in keeping with previous literature and support the assertion that statin users represent a different patient group to those not using statin therapy.

Introduction Statins may prevent organ dysfunction in patients with infections, but the optimal time for this therapy is unknown. Our objective was to determine the evolution of inflammation in patients treated for infection on general wards and the impact of previous statin use. Methods We performed a single-centre prospective cohort study (April to September 2008) in unselected patients admitted to medical wards with infection, collecting data on demographics, comorbidities, and statin use before admission; and 10-day followup data on intensive care or high-dependency unit (ICU/HDU) admission and death, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and organ dysfunction (using a modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), and infection markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBC)). Evolution of organ dysfunction, SIRS, WBC and CRP were analysed descriptively; continuous data are expressed as the mean (SD) or median (Q1 to Q3). The effect of statins was explored in regression models accounting for within-patient correlation, with P <0.05 taken as statistically significant. Results Two hundred and nine patients were admitted with infections (lung 51.0%, urinary 34.2%, skin/soft tissue 18.5%, other 5.2%; ≥1 infection/patient possible): age 63.8 years (20.7), 49.8% male, Charlson score 2 (1 to 3), previous statin users 27.8%, WBC 15.6 (12.0) x 10 9 /l, CRP 105 (113) mg/l. On admission, 88.9% had ≥1 SIRS criterion (median 2 (1 to 3)) and 72.3% had modified SOFA score ≥1 (median 1 (0 to 2)), with no statin versus non-statin group differences. CRP, WBC, and the proportion of patients with ≥1 SIRS criterion and modified SOFA score ≥1 decreased over time (P <0.0001), but generalized linear mixed models showed no effect of statins (P = 0.98, 0.51, 0.55, and 0.25) when adjusted for time, age, sex, and Charlson score. By day 10, seven patients were admitted to the ICU/HDU, four patients had died, and 64 patients had ≥1 day with a higher modified SOFA score versus admission. Overall, 35.9% of patients developed this combined outcome (statin (44.8%) vs. non-statin (32.5%); OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 2.85 to 3.25 after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson score). Conclusions Ward patients with infection often develop some organ dysfunction, but the risk of death/higher care is low. Trials of statins to prevent such clinically important outcomes would need to be large. S137 this study was to study cardiac autonomic balance and heart rate variability (HRV) indices in acute rheumatic fever. Methods A prospective study was conducted on three groups. Group I included 20 patients with acute rheumatic carditis. Group II included 20 patients with no cardiac involvement (10 with chorea (Group IIa) and 10 with arthritis (Group IIb)). Group I included 10 in failure (Group Ia) and 10 compensated (Group Ib). Group III included 20 healthy controls. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) assay, echocardiography, cardiovascular autonomic function tests (5AFTs) and 24-hour ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitoring for arrhythmias and HRV. Studied HRV variables included the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals that are greater than 50 ms (PNN50). Results Group I had significantly higher values for 5AFTs score, NE, supraventricular premature beats (SVPBS) and ventricular premature beats (VPBS) (P <0.001). Measured variables were more affected in Group Ia compared with Group Ib (Table 1) and in patients with heart failure New York Heart Association class IV compared with class Group III. Conclusions Acute rheumatic carditis is associated with significant autonomic dysfunction. HRV indices can be used for risk stratification in those patients.


## Introduction

We have recently shown that recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) improved pulmonary function [1] and cardiac performance [2] in ovine acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. Peroxynitrite (ONOO -) is known to inactivate adrenoreceptors in sepsis. It can be detected with equal amounts of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). rhAPC has been effective to reduce lung 3-NT levels in sepsis [1]. We therefore hypothesized that rhAPC might reduce cardiac 3-NT levels as well, and studied cellular enzymes involved with the ONOOpathway in cardiac tissue. Methods Fifteen sheep (33 to 38 kg) were operatively prepared for chronic study and randomly allocated to either the sham (uninjured, untreated), control (injured) or treatment (rhAPC) groups (n = 5 each). After a tracheotomy, acute lung injury was produced in the control and rhAPC groups by insufflation of cotton smoke, followed by instillation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria into the lungs according to an established protocol [1]. The sheep were studied for 24 hours in the awake state and ventilated with FiO 2 1.0. In the treatment group, rhAPC (24 μg/kg/hour) was intravenously administered, beginning 1 hour post injury. Heart tissue 3-NT, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were measured (ELISA) after 24 hours. Data presented as the mean ± SEM; *significance, P <0.05. Results After 24 hours, 3-NT levels (nM/ml/mg) were 19 ± 3 in sham and were significantly increased in the control group (101 ± 11*). The rhAPC group (22 ± 18*) showed significantly lower 3-NT tissue levels then controls. MDA levels (μM/ml/mg) were 48 ± 5 in sham and were significantly increased in the control group (85 ± 3*). The rhAPC group (41 ± 3*) showed significantly lower MDA tissue levels then controls. The MPO activity (mU/mg) showed no differences between groups: sham (180 ± 11), control (200 ± 15), and rhAPC (210 ± 20), respectively. Conclusions rhAPC has no influence on cardiac MPO levels, but significantly reduced heart tissue 3-NT and MDA levels in ovine acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, thereby improving cardiac performance. These findings may lead to further investigations of rhAPC and cardiovascular function. 


## Introduction

The pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis are complex and poorly understood. We performed a proteomics study to characterize early host responses to sepsis as determined by altered plasma proteome in a porcine model of peritonitis-induced sepsis. Methods In seven instrumented and mechanically ventilated pigs, sepsis was induced by inoculating autologous faeces. Haemodynamics, oxygen exchange, inflammatory responses, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and other laboratory parameters were monitored. Plasma samples were obtained before and 12 hours after the induction of hyperdynamic sepsis. Plasma proteins were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Proteins that changed in abundance were identified by mass spectrometry (MS, quadrupole TOF/TOF MS and MS/MS).

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1  Results From approximately 1,500 protein spots in each gel, levels of 47 proteins spots were significantly altered in the septic plasma samples compared with corresponding baseline ones. MS identified 35 protein forms representing 22 unique proteins whose plasma levels were increased, whereas 12 forms of eight unique proteins were significantly decreased during sepsis.

Conclusions We identified a set of plasma proteins with significantly altered levels during an early phase of sepsis in a porcine model of peritonitis-induced sepsis using a proteomics approach. Most of these altered proteins have important roles in the inflammatory response. Some findings are novel, and exploring their roles may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.

Introduction Studies have demonstrated that silymarin (milk thistle) has cytoprotective effects and induces apoptosis. We hypothesized that silymarin decreases sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rat model through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Methods Forty-eight rats were randomized to sham (n = 16), control (n = 16), and silymarin (n = 16) groups. ALI was induced with CLP in the control and silymarin groups. Animals in the silymarin group received silymarin 50 mg/kg/day for 3 days before the experiment and 2 days afterward. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6; lung tissue malondialdehyde and glutathione levels; lung histopathologic examination; and lung wet-to-dry (w/d) weight ratio measurements were used to compare and evaluate the severity of lung injury between the groups. Apoptosis was quantitated using paraffin sections of lung by fluorescent terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. Survival analyses were also performed. Results Mortality rates for the silymarin and control groups were 37.5% and 87.5%, respectively (log-rank P = 0.0503). Compared with the silymarin group, the control group exhibited significantly more severe lung injury, as indicated by higher mean values for serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid TNFα (P = 0.01 for both), IL-1β (P ≤ 0.028 for both), and IL-6 (P ≤ 0.01 for both); neutrophil infiltration of the lungs (P = 0.003); pulmonary edema (P = 0.001); total lung histopathologic injury score (P <0.001); w/d (P = 0.019); and lung-tissue malondialdehyde (P = 0.011) levels. Lung tissue glutathione levels were significantly higher in the silymarin group than the control group (P = 0.001). Compared with the control group, induction of apoptosis was increased in the silymarin group (P = 0.003).

Conclusions Silymarin reduces the severity of sepsis-induced ALI and may also improve survival in a CLP rat model. These beneficial effects of this agent are probably due to its inhibitory effects on the inflammatory process and oxidative injury and its proapoptotic effect.

Introduction Nattokinase is a serin protease derived from fermentation of boiled soy bean that has a potent fibrinolytic effect [1]. The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of nattokinase on plasma fibrinogen levels, whole blood viscosity and mortality in rats with sepsis. Methods Fifty adult female Wistar rats were used in the study. Nattokinase (6 mg/day) was given via the intragastric route for 7 days. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation-puncture. Analysis of plasma fibrinogen levels, whole blood viscosity and survival was performed.

Results Mean plasma fibrinogen levels of rats that received nattokinase prior to cecal ligation-puncture were lower than the others that did not receive nattokinase prior to cecal ligationpuncture and the sham-operated group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Mean blood viscosity of rats analyzed with the Rheolog™ scanning capillary viscometer was lower in the nattokinase-supplemented animals with cecal ligation-puncture group at a 1/second shear rate (P <0.05) (Figure 1). Nattokinase supplementation did not significantly influence survival rates and survival times of the rats after cecal ligation-puncture.


## Conclusions

The results of our in vivo study were not sufficient to prove the fibrinogenolytic effect of nattokinase but confirmed the results of a previous in vitro study investigating the effect of nattokinase on blood viscosity. More in vivo and in vitro studies with large study populations are required to investigate the use of nattokinase to prevent and treat sepsis-related disseminated intravascular coagulation. Comparison of mean blood viscosity data of the groups Lap (shamoperated group), CLP (cecal ligation-puncture group) and Nat + CLP (nattokinase-supplemented cecal ligation-puncture group).


## Introduction

The aim of the study is to verify the impact of the implementation of the diagnostic and therapeutic bundles suggested by Sepsis Surviving Campaign (SSC) [1] on the outcome of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods A retrospective analysis of the outcome of severe sepsis and septic shock patients before, during and after the implementation of the bundles according to the SSC in an eightbed polyvalent ICU. We evaluated ICU and hospital mortality, the length of stay, the level of compliance to the bundles and its impact on the mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the chisquare test. . We observed a reduction of the overall ICU and hospital mortality from 73% to 43%, not statistically significant, even if the difference between the observed and predicted mortality showed a statistically significant improvement (P = 0.027) (Figure 1). On the contrary, the length of stay [2] was 18 days in 2005, 23 days in 2006, 25 days in 2007. Our compliance was respectively 59% in 2006 and 55% in 2007 for resuscitation bundles and 58% in 2006 and 78% in 2007 for management bundles. The mortality was higher (70%) in the group with an overall compliance score ≤6 compared with 40% for those with a score ≥7.


## Results

Conclusions Even though the main difficulty was to timely reach the targets of the bundles, the existence of a protocolized approach to severe sepsis and septic shock seems to contribute to the reduction of mortality in our population of patients. 


## P342 Compliance with sepsis resuscitation but not management bundles improves the survival of surgical patients with septic shock

Introduction The purpose of this study was to describe the effectiveness of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign bundles with regard to both implementation and outcome in surgical patients with septic shock. Methods A single centre prospective observational study of surgical patients admitted to the ICU from September 2005 to August 2008 fulfilling criteria for the international sepsis definitions.

Results We analyzed prospectively 149 surgical patients with septic shock. The mean age was 69 ± 13 years, APACHE II score: 23 ± 7, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment: 8 ± 2. The mortality rate was 34.2% in the ICU and 42.3% in the hospital. There were no significant differences in the characteristics and the severity of septic shock between the compliant (C) and noncompliant (NC) groups. We found differences in the ICU and hospital mortality between the C and NC groups in two Resuscitation Bundles (RB): central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 ) ≥70% (25% vs. 43%, P = 0.01 and 32% vs. 52%, P = 0.02) and source control (14% vs. 56%, P <0.001 and 24% vs. 63%, P <0.001, respectively).

The compliance rate of all RB was 27% and there were significant differences in mortality between the C and NC groups (17% vs. 40%, P = 0.01 and 35% vs. 49%, P = 0.009 in the ICU and hospital, respectively). There were no significant differences in the ICU and hospital mortality with the Management Bundles compliance. In the multivariate analysis, source control, ScvO 2 ≥70%, compliance of all RB, mechanical ventilation, APACHE II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment were independently associated with mortality. When the influence of age and severity was controlled by logistic regression, source control was Severe sepsis and septic shock hospital mortality. S141 independently associated with survival (OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.55, P = 0.003).

Conclusions Implementation of the RB was associated with decrease mortality of surgical patients with septic shock. Among all sepsis bundle elements, the source control was the only independent predictor of survival. The compliance of Management Bundles had no impact on survival. Results Both groups did not show any difference in initial APACHE II score and clinical baseline characteristics. With implementation of the SOP, use of volume in the first 6 hours (1,506 vs. 2,154 ml, P <0.05) and in the first day (4,005 vs. 6,122 ml, P <0.001) significantly increased. Furthermore, treatment with hydrocortisone, selenium and insulin increased after implementation of the SOP significantly. Catecholamines and rhAPC were unaffected. Mortality in the patient group without SOP was 57%, and in the intervention group with SOP the mortality was 38.5% (P <0.05).


## P343

Conclusions Owing to the implementation of a standard algorithm, a significant increase in volume therapy and adjunctive sepsis therapy were realised more frequently compared with patients treated without the SOP and could be associated with a lower mortality rate in patients. The realisation of an evidence-based SOP in daily practice in patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock might be effective, shown in the alteration of treatment practice and the reduction of mortality.


## Introduction

The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology, consumption of resources and outcome of patients with severe sepsis. Conclusions Severe sepsis was common in Indian ITUs. The ITU mortality was higher compared with the western literature. Grampositive infections were less common although the incidence of parasitic and viral infection was higher than in the West.

Introduction Sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early recognition and treatment are of paramount importance in reducing mortality; this has been highlighted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) [1]. A consensus of opinion exists as to Time Zero being the first instance where severe sepsis is present. We undertook a study of newly qualified doctors in a university teaching hospital, to evaluate how effective they were at recognising severe sepsis; and whether a simple intervention could improve their ability to perform this task.  [1] criteria and associated percentage mortality respectively was nil 59 (8%), SIRS 120 (9%), sepsis 40 (28%), severe sepsis 13 (35%) and septic shock 16 (41%). One hundred and ninety-six patients were deemed to have one of the sepsis diagnoses by the primary physician, an overdiagnosis of 51%. Antibiotic prescription and associated mortality percentage respectively were: appropriate 82 (12%) and inappropriate 100 (28%). Antibiotic therapy was changed correctly after microbiology data in 21 of 88 patients (24%). Duration of therapy was correct in 51 of 183 patients (28%).


## Conclusions

The prevalence of sepsis and the associated mortality is similar to that described in other studies [1]. Physicians tend to overdiagnose sepsis. Antibiotic prescribing practices were incorrect with respect to selection, modification after microbiology data and duration of treatment. A major deficiency in diagnostic and therapeutic ability among physicians was identified in this study. Appropriate steps must be taken to remedy this deficiency. Introduction Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) is an exaggerated inflammatory and coagulation response to infection. sCAP has high rates of mortality and necessitates modified treatment to that for mild/moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the grave nature of this condition it is poorly characterised. A systematic review was performed to gauge current data and identify unmet needs associated with sCAP.

Methods MEDLINE was searched for English-language papers concerning sCAP published after 1998. Results There are a number of published indices for diagnosing sCAP but these are difficult to use in the clinical setting. In the literature, sCAP is defined as CAP requiring admittance to an ICU or as CAP that results in death. Current International Statistical Classification of Disease and diagnosis-related group codes do not specify whether pneumonia is community acquired or hospital acquired or indicate the severity of the infection. Estimates of the prevalence of sCAP in patients with CAP range from 6.6 to 16.0% [1,2]. Mortality rates for patients with sCAP range from 10 to 55% [3,4]. The discrepancy in these rates emphasises the variation in hospital practices due to the lack of an objective definition of sCAP. The absence of a clear definition for sCAP could result in inappropriate treatment of this life-threatening condition, increasing mortality rates. There are scant data concerning the costs of treating sCAP; increased expenditure for patients with sCAP versus those with CAP results from ICU treatment, increased length of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and rehabilitation costs. It is expected that the clinical and cost benefits of new therapies will be more easily recognised if sCAP is consistently defined. Defining sCAP appropriately requires a focused international initiative and collaboration between clinicians and payers. Conclusions There is a major unmet need for a meaningful definition of sCAP. Poor characterisation of sCAP has resulted in variable reports of its prevalence and may result in inappropriate treatment leading to increased mortality in this patient population. The results of this systematic review form the basis for developing a new treatment pathway to improve outcomes for patients with sCAP.

Introduction In this observational cohort study we attempted to elucidate a haemoglobin (Hb) target that favours the mortality outcome in severe sepsis patients. The optimum level of Hb to influence outcome in severe sepsis is yet to be determined. Although the analysis of severe sepsis patients in the Canadian transfusion requirement in critical care study [1] did not find any mortality benefit with a Hb level of 10 g/dl or above, the early goaldirected therapy trial [2] showed significant mortality benefit by achieving haematocrit ≥30%, equivalent to a Hb value of 10 g/dl, during the early treatment period. This pilot study was therefore undertaken to look for any relationship between Hb levels and mortality in severe sepsis patients admitted to the ICU. Methods All patients 16 years or older with severe sepsis or septic shock who stayed longer than 24 hours between July 2006 and June 2007 were retrospectively included in the study. Patient demographics, Hb levels measured by the blood gas analyser during their period of severe sepsis and outcome data were collected. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed with ICU survival and 28-day survival as the dependent variables. 


## Results


## Introduction

Former studies have shown that monocyte apoptosis is crucial for the final outcome of sepsis in the field of acute pyelonephritis [1]. The significance of apoptosis in acute intraabdominal infection was studied. Methods Acute peritonitis was induced after cecal ligation and puncture in 17 male New Zealand rabbits. Four sham-operated rabbits were also studied. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated after Ficol gradient centrifugation; monocytes were further isolated after plastic adherence. Apoptosis of monocytes was estimated after staining positive for annexin V and negative for propidium iodine by flow cytometric analysis. Results Monocyte apoptosis is presented in Table 1. A rate of apoptosis greater than 40% was found in six animals after 24 hours; it was lower than 40% for 11 animals. The median survival of the former was 15.2 days and of the latter 4.2 days (logrank: 5.49, P = 0.019).

Conclusions Sepsis arising in the field of peritonitis is accompanied by inhibition of apoptosis of monocytes. The rate of apoptosis 24 hours after sepsis induction is detrimental for the survival of the septic host.  S145 papers reported association of the IL-10 -1082G allele with adverse outcome in sepsis [1,2]. The study objective was to investigate whether IL-10 promoter polymorphism -1082 G/A is associated with adverse outcome in severe sepsis and septic shock patients.


## Methods

The study was conducted in the mixed medical-surgical adult ICU of P. Stradinš Clinical University Hospital in Riga in 2007 and 2008. A total of 103 critically ill patients who met the proposed severe sepsis and septic shock criteria were included. The IL-10 -1082 polymorphism was genotyped by sequencing. All patients were followed up throughout their stay in the ICU to clinical outcome. The frequency distributions of the genotypes in the subgroups were compared using the Pearson chi-square test. P <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.


## Results

Of the 103 patients observed, 44 (43%) had an adverse outcome in the ICU. In the survival group 11 (19%) had G/G at position -1082 of the IL-10 gene, 25 (42%) were heterozygous G/A, and 23 (39%) were homozygous A/A. In the nonsurvival group five (11%) had G/G, 30 (68%) had A/G, and nine (21%) had the A/A genotype. The polymorphism frequencies between survival and nonsurvival differed significantly (P = 0.034, χ 2 = 6.8).

The relative risk for adverse outcome in IL-10 -1082 alternative G allele carriers (G/G and G/A genotypes) was 1.6 (95% CI = 0.91 to 2.83).

Conclusions We found association of the IL-10 promoter polymorphism -1082 G/A with clinical outcome in severe sepsis and septic shock patients; alternative -1082 G allele carriage seems to be associated with greater risk for adverse outcome in the studied patient population.

Introduction Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a mediator produced by endothelial cells [1]. It is in doubt whether its production in the intubated septic host is due to an effect of anesthetic medication or to the sepsis process. The present study attempted to provide an answer. Methods In 10 mechanically ventilated pigs, anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane inhalation. Then shock was induced by the intravenous administration of 25 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli 111: B4 in eight pigs; two were controls. Blood was collected by a Swan-Ganz catheter and by a peripheral vein. Ang-2 was estimated by an enzyme immunoassay.


## Results

The median Ang-2 of the peripheral circulation among controls and pigs at shock was at baseline 1,403. Introduction Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) is a major endothelial receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein [1]. Its expression is induced by pro-atherogenic stimuli as well as by inflammatory cytokines. LOX-1 acts also as an adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte recruitment. The systemic leukocyte activation in sepsis represents a crucial factor in the impairment of the microcirculation of different tissues, causing multiple organ failure and death. The aim of our experimental study was therefore to evaluate the effects of LOX-1 inhibition on the endotoxin-induced leukocyte adherence within the intestinal microcirculation using intravital microscopy. Methods Group 1 (n = 10 Lewis rats) remained untreated and served as the control group. In Group 2 (n = 10) endotoxemia was induced by intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In Group 3 (n = 10) endotoxemic animals were treated with 10 mg/kg anti-Lox-1-IgG. Endotoxemic animals of Group 4 (n = 10) were treated with an unspecific IgG. Following 2 hours of endotoxin challenge or placebo administration, intestinal microcirculation was evaluated using intravital microscopy. LOX-1 expression was quantified by western blot and reverse-transcription PCR.

Results LOX-1 inhibition reduced significantly the leukocyte adherence in the submucosal venules of the intestinal wall (P <0.05). Functional capillary density of the intestinal muscular layers as well as in the mucosa increased following administration of the LOX-1-antibody in comparison with untreated LPS animals (P <0.05). At the mRNA level, LOX-1 expression was significantly increased in the untreated LPS group (P <0.05) whereas animals with LOX-1-antibody administration showed a significant reduction of the expression (P <0.05).

Conclusions LOX-1-antibody administration in experimental endotoxaemia significantly reduced leukocyte adherence and increased microvascular perfusion within the intestinal microcirculation. The inhibition of the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 may represent an attractive target for the modulation of endotoxin-induced impairment of the microcirculation in sepsis. Conclusions GTS-21 suppresses TNFα and stimulates IL-10 release during human endotoxemia in healthy human volunteers, resulting in a shift towards a more anti-inflammatory pattern. This effect may have potential for in vivo modulation of the innate immune response.

Inflammatory response of critically ill and haemodialysis patients after whole blood stimulation by cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi Introduction IL-2 activates numerous key cells in the immune system [1]. We have previously demonstrated that IFNγ mRNA gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is downregulated in patients with sepsis compared with healthy controls [2]. Here we investigated IFNγ gene expression in cultured PBMC from healthy controls and patients with severe sepsis and examined whether exogenous IL-2 can influence IFNγ mRNA expression. Methods PBMC were isolated from five healthy controls and five patients with severe sepsis and were cultured in 24-well plates.

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Conclusions IFNγ mRNA production is reduced in PBMC in sepsis but can be stimulated ex vivo to produce normal IFNγ levels.

In the absence of rIL-2, IFNγ mRNA production is inducible in T cells but not in monocytes and B cells. IL-2 modulation of IFNγ mRNA production appears to be stimulus dependent, and may contribute to the host defence mechanism.

Introduction Our purpose was to assess the effects of superphysiologic dosages of human purified C1-esterase inhibitor infusion (C1INH) on complement-dependent pathways of systemic inflammatory response in patients with sepsis.


## Methods

In the terms of an open-label prospective control study, human purified C1INH (Bicizar; BioGenius LLC, Russia) was administered at total dosage of 12,000 U to 20 sepsis patients. Patients (n = 22) who did not receive C1INH infusion were enrolled as controls. C3 and C4 complement subunits, IL-6, Creactive protein and procalcitonin results were analyzed in quartiles according to C1INH baseline activity.

Results C1INH activity was different in quartiles at entry in both groups (P <0.03). C1INH infusion resulted in elevation of C1INH activity in the treatment arm ( Figure 1). The most significant difference was observed between the upper quartiles of the groups (P <0.01). The degree of C1INH activity shift had a negative association with the baseline results (r = -0.635, P <0.01). C3 (P <0.01) and C4 (P <0.05) levels displayed a more rapid and pronounced rise after C1INH infusion in patients with higher baseline C1INH activity. The C-reactive protein concentration dropped significantly in patients who received C1INH (130 mg/l (28 to 293)) already on the third day of the study in comparison with the control (185 mg/l (72 to 343); P = 0.022). The same trend characterized the IL-6 level. Patients with elevated procalcitonin values at the onset of sepsis had a more significant C1INH increase (r = 0.635, P <0.05).

Conclusions Downregulation of complement activity with C1INH might help to contain severe systemic inflammation. Presumably, the response to C1INH infusion was related to its baseline activity. C1INH activity in the Bicizar (q) and control groups (c): analysis in quartiles.

with MPs isolated from sham rats (shMPs) and 15 animals inoculated with MPs isolated from rats with peritonitis (sMPs). Rats were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and were infused with the same amount of cMPs or shMPs or sMPs. We measured the heart rate, mean arterial pressure, carotid artery blood flow and portal vein blood flow. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded during 7 hours, and then animals were sacrificed. The aorta and heart were harvested for further in vitro tissue analyses.

Results (1) The cellular origin (phenotype) but not the circulating concentration of MPs was different in septic rats, characterized by a significant increase in leukocyte-derived MPs.

(2) sMPs but not cMPs or shMPs decreased the mean arterial pressure without any effect on carotid artery and portal vein blood flows. (3) Rats inoculated with sMPs exhibited an increase in superoxide ion production and NF-κB activity, overexpression of inducible NO synthase with subsequent NO overproduction and decrease in endothelial NO synthase activation.

Conclusions Rats with sepsis induced by peritonitis exhibited a specific phenotype of MPs. Inoculation of sMPs in healthy rats reproduced hemodynamic, septic inflammatory patterns, associated with oxidative and nitrosative stresses. Introduction Pharmacological actions of gaseous biological mediator hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) include vasodilatation, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration as well as induction of suspended animation-like state [1,2]. Its beneficial cellular actions include cytoprotection and anti-inflammatory effects [2]. Methods Rodent models of ischemia and reperfusion of the heart, murine and ovine models of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a canine model of cardiopulmonary bypass, porcine models of myocardial infarction and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery were used. H 2 S was administered in an iso-osmolar, pHneutral intravenous formulation (IK-1001).

Results In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, a significant protection by IK-1001 was seen in terms of reduction of myocardial infarct size. These effects were accompanied by reduction in myocardial IL-1 levels and reduction in neutrophil infiltration [3]. The cardiac protection of H 2 S was confirmed in a porcine model of myocardial ischemia [4] and in a canine model of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. IK-1001 was also protective in murine and ovine models of acute respiratory distress syndrome, where improvement in survival and pulmonary function was accompanied by a reduction in oxidant stress and suppression of the production of IL-6 and inhibition of the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase [5]. In models of thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery, reperfusion was accompanied with significant increases in the production of IL-1 and IL-6, which were reduced by IK-1001. IK-1001 also improved renal function, provided hemodynamic stabilization and attenuated oxidative DNA damage [6].

Conclusions H 2 S thus exerts organ-protective and anti-inflammatory effects in various animal models of critical illness. The mechanisms may involve metabolic effects leading to the induction of hypothermia, antioxidant mechanisms, modulation of gene expression, activation of KATP channels, and inhibition of inflammatory cell activation.

Introduction Kidney ischemia is one of the mechanisms of acute renal failure and it is known that the free oxygen radicals play an important role in this type of injury. We tested the hypothesis that dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), a free radical scavenger, has a protective role in a renal ischemia-reperfusion animal model [1]. Methods Renal ischemia was induced to 45 male, New Zealand rabbits. The subjects were divided into three groups based on ischemia duration: 30, 60 or 90 minutes. Each group was divided into three subgroups: (a) DMSO previous to ischemia, (b) DMSO after ischemia, (c) control group. All subjects were given 6 hours of reperfusion. Three blood samples were taken at baseline, ischemic and reperfusion phases. Each sample was tested for serum creatinine, blood ureic nitrogen and urea. After reperfusion, bilateral nephrectomy was performed on each subject before euthanasia. A pathological analysis evaluated tubular and basement membrane changes. The level of injury was scaled in three stages: mild, moderate and severe.


## Results

The histological analysis showed severe damage in 33% of the control group, compared with 0% in both treatment groups (chi-square P = 0.00) ( Table 1). Blood chemistry analysis in the control group at 60 and 90 minutes of ischemia showed higher Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction It has been reported that the blood level of carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) is increased in critically ill patients such as those with sepsis or multiple trauma [1,2]. Because carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the metabolites of heme catabolism, it has been suggested that there may be increased breakdown of heme in these patients. Heme oxygenase (HO) is the enzyme involved in the rate-limiting step for catabolism of hemecontaining proteins. It was recently reported that HO-1 acts as a potent anti-inflammatory agent and antioxidant through its products [3]. HO-1 may therefore be an inducible defense against cellular stress that occurs during the inflammatory process [1,4]. Against this background, we decided to evaluate the relation among the blood level of CO, HO-1 expression by monocytes, oxidative stress, and the outcome of sepsis. Methods Thirty patients who fulfilled the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock and 17 other patients without sepsis during their stay in the ICU were studied. HO-1 expression by monocytes, arterial CO, oxidative stress, and cytokines were measured.

Results Arterial blood levels of CO, cytokines, as well as monocyte HO-1 expression were higher in septic shock patients than in nonseptic patients. Increased HO-1 expression was significantly correlated with the arterial CO concentration and oxidative stress. There was a positive correlation between survival and higher HO-1 expression or CO level. Conclusions We found that the increase of endogenous CO production in sepsis mainly reflects increased heme turnover secondary to upregulation of HO-1, which is partially in response to systemic oxidative stress. A strong correlation between the blood CO level and survival supports the beneficial effect of HO-1 upregulation and increased CO production in patients with sepsis.

Introduction IL-18 is said to be involved in organ injury. We investigated the IL-18 values of septic acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Methods The subjects were 38 patients during the 3-year period from 2004 to 2007 from whom it was possible to collect a blood specimen within approximately 6 hours of the onset of septic ALI or ARDS. Their mean age was 67 years, and their mean APACHE II score was 29. Their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 13, and their mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was 170. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was 246 in the ALI group and 135 in the ARDS group. There were four cases (10.5%) in the 28-day mortality group, and six cases (15.8%) in the 90-day mortality group.


## Results

The value of IL-18 in the dead group was significantly higher than in the surviving group (1,649 ± 1,056 pg/ml vs. 4,523 ± 2,798 pg/ml; P <0.05), and in the ARDS group was also significantly higher than in the ALI group (2,467 ± 1,880 pg/ml vs. 1,314 ± 800 pg/ml; P <0.05).

Conclusions These results suggested that IL-18 may play a major role in progression of ARDS in respiratory disorder as multiple organ failure.

Introduction Sepsis is often accompanied by myocardial depression; one of the possible mechanisms includes mitochondrial injury. We hypothesized that opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) may occur during sepsis-induced myocardial depression. We investigated the opening of the mPTP in septic hearts by measuring cytochrome C release into the cytosol.

Methods Sepsis was induced in rats by 7.5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide injection intraperitoneally. After 4 hours, hearts were excised and mounted in a Langendorff setup to study myocardial contractility ex vivo. Subsequently, hearts were frozen and 5 μm cryostat sections were made. Sections were stained for cytochrome C using immunohistochemistry. Healthy rats served as controls.

Results Septic animals showed a decreased contractility (P <0.005) and lower developed pressure (P <0.001) when compared with healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed no release of cytochrome C in healthy or septic hearts. Conclusions Cytochrome C is not released during sepsis-induced myocardial depression. These results indicate that the mitochondrial permeability pore may not be involved in the development of myocardial dysfunction during sepsis.

Introduction Comparing genomic changes in mice strains demonstrating physiologic differences with pathologic insults is a novel approach to elucidate potential mechanisms. Our hypothesis was that murine strains exhibit different cardiac/genomic responses to specific pathogens. Methods The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) and end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) cardiac performance was compared in B6, C57 and FVB mice (pressurevolume loops, Millar catheter; isoflurane anesthesia) 4 hours after zymosan (ZYM) or endotoxin (LPS) intraperitoneally. Gene expression profiles unique to mouse strain/baseline/treatment were created using two-way ANOVA/two-fold filtering.

Results ESPVR improved in B6/C57 mice after ZYM ( Figure 1). Diastolic compromise (Figure 2) occurred in FVB mice following ZYM but in B6 mice after LPS. Genomic analyses within strains revealed pathogen-specific differences: for example, ZYM-treated FVB mice (diastolic impairment) demonstrated downregulation of key cell cycle, vascular endothelial growth factor, L-type calcium channel genes, with upregulation of T-cell receptor and the srcfamily kinase (exaggerated inflammatory response).

Conclusions Comparative genomic analyses provide new insights into septic cardiac pathophysiology.

Introduction Cardiac dysfunction is one of the key features in sepsis and septic shock, yet its mechanism is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in sepsis by integrating echocardiographic with biochemical and inflammatory markers. Methods Over 14 months, 127 consecutive, septic/systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients in our ICU were collected. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography with measurements of systolic and diastolic function, and blood samples were collected and serum separated for measurements of biomarkers. All clinical parameters were collected from the ICU charts during the days of echocardiography studies and blood sampling. Outcome measures were ICU, inhospital survival and survival up to 2 years. Patients with segmental wall motion abnormality -indicating myocardial infarction or regional ischemia and/or significant mitral or aortic disease -were excluded from the analyses.

Results Out of 86 patients without regional myocardial dysfunction and/or significant valvular disease, 36 (42%) died during follow-up, almost all of them within the first 6 months. Thirty-one (36%) patients had positive blood cultures and they were more tachycardic and hypotensive and had shorter E-wave deceleration time than SIRS (negative culture) patients (P = 0.024). The echocardiographic measurements most predictive of mortality by Cox survival analysis were E-wave/Em ratio (Exp(β) = 1.12, P = 0.006) and pressure gradient over the tricuspid valve (Exp(β) = 1.04, P <0.0001). Among the biomarkers, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and IL-18 were the strongest predictors of mortality (P = 0.004 and P <0.001). Troponin and NT-proBNP best correlated with higher E-wave/Em ratio, and lower Em and Sm waves and with the cytokines TNFα and IL-8. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular endsystolic volume or left ventricular ejection fraction did not predict survival and did not correlate with troponin or NT-proBNP elevation.

Conclusions After exclusion of all patients with coronary artery disease and/or significant valvular dysfunction, there is still a significant incidence of troponin and NT-proBNP elevation in septic/SIRS patients. Echocardiographic features most significantly associated with troponin and NT-proBNP elevation were measures of diastolic dysfunction (high E-wave/Em ratio, low Sm and Em). Measures of systolic dysfunction did not correlate with troponin or NT-proBNP elevation.

Introduction Risk stratification is a major problem in the care of critically ill patients. To date, there is no widespread acceptance of any prognostic marker for ongoing risk stratification. In the present study we aim to determine whether N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) serves as a marker of dynamic risk stratification. Methods This prospective observational study was performed in the ICU of the Department of Cardiology/Medical University of Vienna between August 2004 and June 2007. Adult patients with a length of ICU stay ≥48 hours were included. In addition to routine clinical and laboratory assessment, blood samples for determination of NT-pro-BNP were obtained in all patients on admission (NT-pro-BNP-0h) and after 48 hours (NT-pro-BNP-48h). NT-pro-BNP plasma levels were assessed by use of commercially available kits.

Results Out of 286 patients included (196 male (68.5%), age 64 ± 14 years), there were 226 ICU survivors (79%). ICU survivors had significantly lower NT-pro-BNP-0h as well as NT-pro-BNP-48h levels compared with ICU nonsurvivors (7,063 ± 9,183 vs. 15,254 ± 12,850 pg/ml, P <0.0001, NT-pro-BNP-0h; and 8,304 ± 9,147 vs. 17,302 ± 12,687 pg/ml, P <0.0001, NT-pro-BNP-48h, respectively). There was no statistically significant change in NTpro-BNP levels in ICU survivors compared with ICU nonsurvivors (Δ-NT-pro-BNP 1,240 ± 7,814 vs. 2,047 ± 11,081 pg/ml, P = 0.624), but significantly more ICU survivors had a decrease in NTpro-BNP within 48 hours (37% vs. 33%, P <0.0001). In Cox regression models, NT-pro-BNP-0h, NT-pro-BNP-48h and increase/decrease of NT-pro-BNP were independent predictors of ICU mortality within 28 days, with NT-pro-BNP-48h being the most potent parameter (NT-pro-BNP-0h Wald 11.289, P = 0.001; NTpro-BNP-48h Wald 17.630, P <0.001; increase/decrease Wald 4.992, P = 0.025, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with respect to prediction of ICU survival was 0.714 (P <0.0001) for NT-pro-BNP-0h, 0.713 (P <0.0001) for NT-pro-BNP-48h and 0.489 (P = 0.800) for Δ-NT-pro-BNP.

Conclusions NT-pro-BNP reflects not only the severity of the disease on ICU admission, but -more importantly -the plasticity of NT-pro-BNP monitors the severity of the disease during the ICU stay.

Introduction Endothelin-1 is known to be elevated in patients with various pulmonary and nonpulmonary diagnoses. CT-pro-endothelin-1 (CT-pro-ET-1) is a stable precursor molecule of endothelin-1.

In the present study we tested whether CT-pro-ET-1 is elevated in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. Moreover, we tested whether an elevation of CT-pro-ET-1 is a predictor of an adverse outcome.

Methods In this prospective observational study we included 78 patients with documented respiratory failure on ICU admission and 266 patients with various other diagnoses and without respiratory failure. Blood samples for determination of CT-pro-ET-1 were obtained in all patients on ICU admission. CT-pro-ET-1 was determined by use of a new sandwich immunoassay.

Results Respiratory failure was attributed to a primary pulmonary cause in 66 patients: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 15), pulmonary hypertension (n = 7), pneumonia (n = 17), acute respiratory distress (n = 3), pulmonary embolism (n = 6), postoperative respiratory failure (n = 12) and various/mixed causes (n = 6). A total of 12 patients had respiratory failure because of primary cardiogenic edema. Patients presenting with primary pulmonary failure on ICU admission had significantly higher CT-pro-ET-1 levels compared with patients with diagnosis of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and patients without respiratory failure (193 ± 117 vs. 160 ± 67 vs. 148 ± 94 pmol/l, P = 0.007).

In patients with primary pulmonary failure and in patients with cardiogenic edema, there was no statistically significant difference in CT-pro-ET-1 levels between ICU survivors and ICU nonsurvivors (195 ± 155 vs. 191 ± 127 pmol/l, P = 0.908 and 160 ± 75 vs. 164 ± 5 pmol/l, P = 0.940). In contrast, in the mixed cohort of critically ill patients without respiratory failure, CT-pro-ET-1 levels were statistically significantly lower in ICU survivors compared with ICU nonsurvivors (140 ± 93 vs. 179 ± 95 pmol/l, P = 0.007).

Conclusions CT-pro-ET-1 plasma levels are increased in patients admitted to the ICU because of respiratory failure. Elevated plasma levels of CT-pro-ET-1 are a potent marker of adverse outcome in our mixed cohort of critically ill patients. In the subgroup of patients admitted to the ICU because of respiratory failure due to a primary pulmonary cause or due to cardiogenic edema, however, elevation of CT-pro-ET-1 did not provide statistically significant prognostic information.

Serum high-mobility group box-1 protein as a specific marker of severe abdominal injury Introduction Trauma cases who have altered consciousness are candidates for missed injury of the abdomen. A specific marker of severe abdominal trauma would therefore be considered useful for rapid evaluation and treatment of abdominal injuries in trauma cases. On the other hand, high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) has been widely studied in relation to its role in sepsis and inflammation [1,2]. Methods We measured the serum HMGB1 concentrations in 50 consecutive trauma patients as early as possible after they arrived in the emergency room. All cases with an abbreviated injury scale over 3 were enrolled in the study. The correlations between the serum HMGB1 levels and the body region of injury were examined. Then, a comparative evaluation of the injury severity score, revised trauma score and probability of survival was conducted in the patients with and without elevated serum HMGB1 concentrations. In addition, we measured the serum HMGB1 levels in 45 septic shock patients and the relationship between the HMGB1 level and underlying disease. Results There were no significant correlations between the serum HMGB-1 levels and the presence of severe head, chest or extremity injury. On the other hand, the serum HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in the subject group with severe abdominal injury (mean HMGB-1 level, 16.9 ng/ml; 10 cases) as compared with that in the subject group without severe abdominal injury (mean HMGB-1 level, 2.2 ng/ml; 40 cases) (P = 0.0069). In septic shock patients, the serum HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in the subject group with peritonitis (mean HMGB-1 level, 19.1 ng/ml; 22 cases) as compared with that in the subject group without peritonitis (mean HMGB-1 level, 8.8 ng/ml; 23 cases) (P = 0.0447).

Conclusions According to our data, high serum levels of HMGB1 were not correlated with an increased likelihood of head injury, chest injury or extremity injury, but were significantly correlated with the presence of severe abdominal injury. This result suggests the possibility of the serum HMGB-1 level representing a specific marker of severe abdominal injury.


## Introduction

The conventional sepsis diagnosis, using the cultivation technique, needs 24 hours for bacterial identification and 36 hours for fungal. The use of empiric therapy makes the growth of bacteria and fungi slower or may yield negative findings in many cases of septic shock. The molecular technique can contribute to a more rapid and specific diagnosis in septic patients. SeptiFast detects 26 bacterial and fungal species DNAs, using the PCR in real time and giving results after 6 hours. This is important for de-escalation therapy and beginning of appropriate antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sensibility and the specificity of the SeptiFast test versus traditional diagnosis. Methods We enrolled 16 patients admitted to the ICU in the past 6 months with surgical severe sepsis and septic shock. All patients were treated with empiric antibiotics at the time of testing. Fungal and bacterial DNA was detected by the LightCycler SeptiFast. We compared the results of molecular diagnosis with the cultivation technique (BACTEC 9050) and microbiological blood culture Results The preliminary results are presented in Table 1. to 179)) in comparison with those without sepsis (n = 147) (ACR1 = 56.6 (IQR 27 to 111) and ACR2 = 37.8 (IQR 18 to 93)) (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1). In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, ACR1 emerged as the most reliable indicator of sepsis (area under curve (AUC) of ACR1 = 0.710 >AUC of ACR2 = 0.694). ACR1 concentration of 145.7 mg/g had sensitivity of 50.5% and specificity of 87.1% with positive predictive value of 71.6% and negative predictive value of 73.1% in diagnosis of sepsis.

Conclusions Absence of significant microalbuminuria at the time of ICU admission is unlikely to be associated with sepsis.

Introduction Endotoxin (ET) is a structural molecule of the Gramnegative bacilli extracellular membrane, which activates target cells including macrophages and neutrophils, and causes septic shock. But it is known that the conventional ET measurement method has many problems; for example, a discrepancy between plasma ET concentration and clinical manifestation in the septic patient. We therefore evaluate the usefulness of a new developed method to measure the plasma ET activity (endotoxin activity assay (EAA)) [1] in patients under sepsis compared with the ordinary method of the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay.

Comparison of ACR1 between sepsis and nonsepsis patients. nonactivated 44% (7/16), moderately activated 13% (3/23) and highly activated 50% (7/14). A bell-shaped mortality relationship was noted, with high mortalities in both the nonactivated and highly activated groups, and a much lower mortality in the moderately activated group. Subdividing the PC activation groups according to APACHE II score yielded the highest mortality, 71% (5/7), in the nonactivated subgroup with APACHE II ≥25, whereas the APACHE II score showed no relationship with mortality in the other PC activation groups. Minimum PC levels did not correlate with APC-PCI and showed no significant differences between the activation groups.

Conclusions Nonactivation of PC in sepsis may represent the failure of an appropriate protective response and is therefore associated with increased mortality, especially when the APACHE II score is elevated. Septic patients without PC activation and a high APACHE II score may be those who are most likely to benefit from APC treatment. PC measurements were not predictive of PC activation as indicated by APC-PCI levels.

Copeptin is a strong and independent predictor of outcome in cardiogenic shock In a logistic regression model, copeptin was the best predictor of ICU survival, with only NT-pro-BNP providing independent additional information (copeptin OR = 1.002; P = 0.001 and NT-pro-BNP OR = 1.001; P = 0.05).

Conclusions Elevated plasma levels of copeptin are a strong and independent predictor of adverse outcome in patients with cardiogenic shock.

Introduction Early diagnosis of sepsis is crucial for management and outcome of critically ill patients. The use of clinical parameters, white cell count or body temperature proved far from ideal in identifying patients who need antimicrobial therapy. The lack of a sensible and specific marker of infection may be responsible for delaying or prolonging antibiotic use [1]. The aims of this work were to test the predictive ability of the serial monitoring of IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) to stratify the different levels of sepsis and to assess whether their measurement could add to the therapeutic decision-making process during longterm ICU stay.

Methods In a prospective observational study we studied the time course of inflammatory markers in consecutive cases of long-term critical illness in the general ICU of a university hospital. Daily sera were subsequently analyzed for CRP, PCT and IL-6 (only in the last 16 patients) in all patients with length of stay >6 days.

Results We enrolled 26 patients, for a total of 592 days. In seven patients that never experienced severe sepsis/septic shock CRP, PCT and IL-6 levels decreased over time, the 14 who recovered had a reduction of markers, while no variation was found in five patients expired in sepsis. One hundred and ninety-eight days classified as severe sepsis/septic shock had CRP (72. (105.51 to 289.27)) higher than 394 SIRS/sepsis days, P <0.001. Prediction of severe sepsis/septic shock (receiver operating characteristic area) was 0.59 ± 0.03 for CRP, 0.82 ± 0.02 for PCT and 0.76 ± 0.03 for IL-6 (P <0.001). Forty-four antibiotic courses were recorded; the initial value of markers was higher than the last day, and mean course values were higher than those without antibiotics. Adopting 0.25 ng/ml as the PCT cutoff value between infection expected to be treated with antibiotics and inflammation without the need for antibiotic therapy, inappropriate antibiotic treatment was given on 202/592 days. Conclusions Daily measure of PCT, at variance of CRP or IL-6, is accurate in discriminating a day spent in severe sepsis/septic shock. An antimicrobial therapy policy based only on clinical diagnosis proved ineffective, with 34% of inappropriate days that could have been saved using a PCT-guided antibiotic strategy. marker of local bacterial infections. By this method, the normal value of PCT is defined as <0.25 ng/ml -but according to some publications PCT <0.1 ng/ml is a more reliable cutoff point to reject diagnosis of local bacterial infection. Some patients after major surgery have nonspecific signs of infection (for example, fever, leukocytosis) that is usually discussed as true infection and antibiotic therapy (ABT) is provided. We tried to optimize ABT in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass using PCT. Methods Sixty-six patients aged from 2 days to 72 years (39 adults, 27 children) with nonspecific signs of infection without its focus were studied. Seventy-six PCT tests from blood plasma were made (PCT sensitive LIA; BRAHMS, Germany) to decide whether ABT is sufficient or antibiotics should be prescribed/changed/ discontinued. Results Based on PCT testing results we have made following decisions (see Figure 1). As Figure 1 shows, when PCT was <0.1 ng/ml antibiotics were discontinued or not prescribed in 61% of cases. In 30% of cases we prolonged ABT for several days. Only in 9% cases were antibiotics changed. In patients who had PCT of 0.1 to 0.25 ng/ml we tended to continue or change ABT (77%). If elevated PCT levels (>0.25 ng/ml) were detected, we prescribed (20%) or reinforced (73%) ABT in the majority of cases. In total we discontinued or did not prescribe antibiotics in 31/76 cases (41%) taking into consideration the results of PCT testing. We did not register progression of bacterial infection in those cases with the exception of one 10-month patient with mild exacerbation of bronchitis. Conclusions There is a big need to optimize ABT in postoperative period in cardiac surgery patients due to significant overuse of antibiotics. PCT-guided tactics are safe and allowed reduction of unnecessary antibiotic usage in patients with nonspecific signs of infection. At the same time, supernormal PCT levels are a strong indicator to prescribe or change ABT.  Receiver operating characteristic analysis of APACHE II, APACHE IV and PCT. Introduction It has been suggested that plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels measured on discharge from the ICU may be a useful predictor of either unplanned readmission or unexpected death on the ward. Previous work has found that raised plasma CRP independently predicted, in separate studies, each of these two poor outcomes [1,2]. We investigated whether these results could be repeated in our mixed medical/surgical ICU for a composite poor outcome measure combining death and readmission. Methods We prospectively enrolled a cohort comprised of all ICU admissions over 1 year. We collected admission clinical and demographic data and APACHE II scores. At discharge we recorded the white cell count and serum levels of CRP and albumin, and we observed death and readmission outcomes up to 2 weeks after ICU discharge. This time period was chosen on the grounds that an association between discharge CRP and postdischarge outcome should relate to persisting inflammatory activity and would be of most relevance in the short term.

## Introduction

Neonates are recommended smaller doses of morphine than adults and, accordingly, we hypothesised that the distribution of morphine and its metabolites over the blood-brain barrier differs between these age groups. In addition, neonatal asphyxia, with potentially harmful effects on the brain, in theory, might further affect the pharmacokinetics of substances over the blood-brain barrier. Methods During anaesthesia, microdialysis probes were inserted into the brain cortex and in a central vein of 11 exteriorized nearterm lambs (127 gestation days) and six nonpregnant adult sheep. Five of these lambs were subjected to 10 minutes of asphyxia through umbilical cord occlusion during delivery. Morphine, 1 mg/kg, was thereafter intravenously administered as a 10 minute constant infusion. Microdialysis and blood samples were collected for up to 360 minutes after morphine administration, and analyzed using liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry. Data presented as the mean ± SD.


## Results

The morphine unbound drug brain:blood distribution ratio (K p,uu ) was 1.19 ± 0.20 and 1.89 ± 0.51 for the sheep and premature lambs without asphyxia, respectively (P = 0.018). The half-lives in the blood and brain cortex, clearance, volume of distribution, and distribution in the brain of unbound drug were all numerically significantly higher in the adult sheep as compared with the premature lambs. The morphine-3-glucuronide K p,uu values were 0.27 ± 0.16 and 0.17 ± 0.15 in sheep and premature lambs (P = NS), indicating a net efflux from the brain in both groups. Induced asphyxia did not affect the results.


## Conclusions

The morphine K p,uu was above unity, indicating a net influx of morphine into the brain. In addition, influx was significantly higher in premature lambs than in adult sheep. We interpret this as an active transport of morphine into the brain, which may be counteracted with increased efflux with age. Further, neonatal asphyxia did not change these pharmacokinetic findings. The K p,uu in the sheep was different from the values obtained in humans (0.64), rats (0.49), mice (0.5) and pigs (0.47), where a net efflux of morphine from the brain was observed.

Introduction Volatile anaesthetics using the anesthetic conserving device (ACD) have become an alternative ICU sedation regimen [1,2]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postconditioning effects following sevoflurane or propofol administration in patients after elective cardiac surgery. Methods Fifty patients either received sevoflurane via ACD or propofol for ICU sedation. The primary endpoint was a change in troponine T (TNT), besides measures of myocardial creatine kinase (CK-MB), N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and haemodynamics. Measure points were set at baseline, end of surgery, 24 hours and 48 hours after surgery.

Results TNT and CK-MB levels were significantly higher (P <0.0001) at all measure points compared with baseline in each group, without any significant differences between both groups. NT-proBNP values were significantly lower following sevoflurane at 24 and 48 hours (P <0.05) compared with propofol ( Figure 1). Conclusions Postoperative sevoflurane sedation via ACD led to lower NT-proBNP levels at 24 and 48 hours, while TNT and CK-MB values were comparable in both study groups.

Introduction Daily interruption of continuous infusions of sedatives (wake-up calls (WC)) has been found previously to promote more rapid withdrawal of ventilatory support in ICU patients. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring has been reported to adequately describe the depth of sedation in critically ill patients. We compared the effectiveness and safety of both sedation strategies in a mixed medical-surgical ICU population.

Methods Patients expected to need sedation for at least 1 day were randomly assigned to a WC strategy, sedation guided by BIS, or a control group. Clinical assessment of the sedation depth, the Ramsay score, was performed in all three groups. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1

Conclusions These results showed that the implementation of sedation protocols for intubated patients added to the implementation of NIV decreased moreover the duration of IMV.


## Introduction

The effect of therapeutic hypothermia on sedative drug clearance and neurological prognostication is unknown. Hypothermia has been shown to affect clearance of drugs metabolised by the cytochrome p450 system (fentanyl, midazolam and muscle relaxants) [1]. We undertook a retrospective study to ascertain whether the use of remifentanil sedation was associated with reduced duration of ICU stay, ventilation, mortality or neurological outcome compared with fentanyl in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.  S163 hospital mortality and neurological outcome at hospital discharge. Good neurological outcome was classified as Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Criteria grade 1 to 2 at hospital discharge [2]. Predictive models used multivariable logistic regression.


## Methods

Results Eighty-three patients received therapeutic hypothermia (crude ICU mortality 43%, median APACHE II score 18); of which 54 received fentanyl sedation and 29 remifentanil. In the multivariable models, remifentanyl was not associated with ICU (P = 0.35) or hospital (P = 0.22) mortality or good neurological outcome (P = 0.75). However, remifentanyl was associated with a positive trend towards an increase in both ventilator-free and ICUfree days (both P = 0.08).

Conclusions Use of remifentanil was not associated with a reduction in ICU or hospital mortality, nor with good neurological outcome. However, there was a trend to increased ventilator-free and ICU-free days. This effect needs to be confirmed prospectively with a larger dataset. Caution must be exercised regarding the effect of delayed sedative drug metabolism on neurological assessment in patients who have undergone therapeutic hypothermia, especially drugs metabolised by the cytochrome p450 system.

Introduction Critically ill patients often require emergency intubation with administration of etomidate as the sedative agent. The use of etomidate has been challenged as it causes a reversible adrenal insufficiency probably leading to an increase in hospital morbidity.

Methods In this prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind trial, we assigned 234 patients to receive 0.3 mg/kg etomidate and 235 patients to receive 2 mg/kg ketamine for intubation. The primary endpoint was the maximum value of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA max ) during the first inhospital 3 days. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00440102.) Results The mean SOFA max score between the two groups was not significantly different (10.3 ± 3.7 for etomidate vs. 9.6 ± 3.9 for ketamine; P = 0.056). There was no significant difference in 28day mortality (81 (35%) deaths vs. 72 (31%) deaths, P = 0.36), the number of patients needing catecholamine (137 (59%) patients vs. 120 (51%) patients, P = 0.10), median (IQR) ventilator-free days (12 (0 to 25) days vs. 15 (0 to 26) days, P = 0.36) and median (IQR) hospital-free days (4 (0 to 22) days vs. 6 (0 to 23) days, P = 0.57). Adrenal insufficiency incidence was significantly higher in etomidate than ketamine group (86% vs. 48%, P <0.001).

There was no significant difference between the two groups in intubation conditions. There was no significant difference in outcome between the etomidate and ketamine groups on prespecified subgroup analysis (trauma or sepsis patients). 


## Introduction

The development of delirium within the ICU and postoperatively is an important problem in the ICU, and it has previously been associated with an increased hospital mortality.

## Methods

The preoperative risk of cardiac or respiratory events was scored using the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) and the preoperative respiratory failure index (PRFI) in 403 patients. Methods Sixty-three adult medical and surgical ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive magnesium (2 g bolus intravenously, continued by 16 g/day infusion, target range 1.0 to 2.0 mmol/l) or saline. Patients were sedated with remifentanil and midazolam titrated to achieve the desired level of sedation measured by the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). Those patients achieving a RASS score of ±1 or 0 were monitored daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). The incidence of delirium, delirium duration, daily remifentanil and midazolam consumption were compared between groups. Statistical performance was compared using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests.


## Results

The groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, and admission APACHE II (17.2 ± 5 vs. 18.5 ± 8) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (4.9 ± 2 vs. 5.6 ± 3) scores. The incidence of at least one episode of delirium occurrence was 25% in the magnesium group and 27.3% in the control group. The magnesium group achieved the desired level of sedation of RASS score ±1.0 much earlier than the control group and spent more time within that level of RASS score (68% vs. 36%) Addition of magnesium resulted in more days without delirium (89% vs. 55%).

There was a reduction in the daily remifentanil and midazolam consumption in the magnesium group. Conclusions This is a preliminary report of an ongoing study. Our results demonstrated that addition of magnesium to the sedation protocol lowers both the remifentanil and midazolam consumption and resulted in more days without delirium in a mixed population of ICU patients.

Memory dysfunction after brain traumatic injury depends on the Marshall score but not on the duration of sedation: preliminary findings 


## Introduction

The aim of the study was to identify the causes of memory dysfunction after brain traumatic injury. Recently, a light anaesthesia, more than a deep anaesthesia, has been accused of causing postoperative cognitive dysfunction [1]. Conversely, the daily sedative interruption in ICU patients does not result in adverse mental outcome [2]. Patients affected by brain injury can have severe memory dysfunction after discharge [3]. Methods One hundred and twenty-one patients were admitted to an emergency department ICU in 2007 with major trauma (injury severity score >15) and severe to moderate brain injury (Glasgow coma scale <13). Of these patients, 25 died in the days following trauma. Thirty-four of them -submitted, during the ICU stay, to several lengths of sedation (17.2 ± 9.2 days; range 1 to 40)were evaluated at the follow-up visit 6 months after discharge from the ICU. As a part of neurological evaluation, verbal and visuospatial memory tests were administered to the patients to obtain a diagnosis of memory dysfunction. Conclusions In brain traumatic injury patients the extent of brain damage, qualified by the Marshall score, is related to late memory dysfunction regardless of the length of sedation and the severity of the initial clinical picture.


## Introduction

In recent years there has been increasing evidence that resuscitation strategy with different fluids can have widely divergent impacts on the immune response. This study was undertaken to determine the COX-2 and E-selectin expression in the lung tissue in the swine model during an acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) procedure with hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0,4), normal saline solution (NS) or gelatin (GEL). Methods Twenty-eight pigs were anesthetized, instrumented and randomized into four groups: control, ANH + HES, ANH + NS and ANH + GEL. Animals in the ANH group were submitted to ANH to a target hematocrit of 15% with volume replacement performed with HES and GEL at a 1:1 ratio and NS at a 3:1 ratio. The withdrawn blood was returned to the animals 120 minutes after the end of hemodilution. After euthanasia, the chest cavity was opened and the lobes of the lung were removed and fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution. After the histopathological assessment, the lungs were prepared with antibody anti-COX-2 and E-selectin. The pathologist, who was blinded to the experimental protocol, scored the expression of COX-2 and E-selectin by semiquantitatively evaluating the intensity (absent -0, weak -1, moderate -2 and strong -3) and incidence (absent -0, 10% -1, 10 to 50% -2, 50 to 75% -3 and 75 to 100% -4) of positively stained endothelium of the interstitial pulmonary microvasculature. The total index was obtained from the sum of the frequency and the intensity scores. For the immunohistochemistry score, a nonparametric Fisher's test was used.


## Results

The intravascular leukocytes expression of COX-2 in the NS group was weak and differed significantly only from the GEL group (P <0.05). In contrast, groups HES and GEL showed a moderate and strong COX-2 expression, respectively, which was different from the control group (P <0.05, P <0.001, respectively).

Blunt abdominal trauma in children: a score to predict the absence of organ injury Introduction Blunt abdominal traumas (BAT) are frequent and potentially life-threatening events in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial workup, and to design a score that would allow ruling out significant intra-abdominal organ injuries. Methods Data were collected prospectively from 147 consecutive patients admitted for BAT in a tertiary-care hospital, over a 30month period. The statistical significance of various parameters (trauma mechanism, clinical examination, laboratory tests and ultrasound findings) was analyzed in relation to intra-abdominal injuries. To fix the cutoff limits for the various laboratory tests, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The items with the highest negative predictive value (NPV) were then selected, and their respective relative risk was computed. This was then integrated in a score (named Blunt Abdominal Trauma in Children (BATiC)), which was tested on our population.


## Results

Among the 31 parameters evaluated, 10 differed significantly between the two groups: abdominal pain, signs of peritoneal irritation, hemodynamic instability, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (AST), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), lipase, creatinine, and abdominal ultrasound. For the six laboratory examinations, cutoff limits were determined using the ROC curves: AST >60 IU/l, ALT >25 IU/l, LDH >330 IU/l, WBC count >9.5 g/l, lipase >30 IU/l, and creatinine >50 IU/l. Based on their respective relative risks for abdominal organ injury, the following points were attributed for these items: abnormal abdominal Doppler ultrasound (4), abdominal pain (2), peritoneal irritation (2), hemodynamic instability (2), AST >60 IU/l (2), ALT >25 IU/l (2), WBC count >9.5 g/l (1), LDH >330 IU/l (1), lipase >30 IU/l (1), creatinine >50 μg/l (1). A score ≤7 had a NPV of 97%, and included 67% of the studied population.

Conclusions These results suggest that in hemodynamically stable patients with a normal abdominal Doppler ultrasound, and a BATiC score ≤7, intra-abdominal lesions are very unlikely, and systematic CT scan or hospital admission may be avoided.

Risk of infection to packed gauze in damage control surgery for patients with hemorrhagic shock: safe limit of duration of packing  Duration of packing and bacterial culture of packed gauze.

Methods A prospective observational case-series study. We performed bacterial culture of the removed gauze in patients who underwent gauze packing in damage control surgery and removal of the packed gauze. We examined the relation between the duration of packing and risk of infection of the packed gauze.

Results Twenty-one patients were enrolled. The duration of packing ranged from 19 to 146 hours. Bacterial culture was negative in 52% of cases and positive in 48% of cases. Bacterial culture was positive in all cases in whom the duration of packing was over 100 hours. The duration of packing was longer in positive bacterial culture cases than in negative (no statistical difference). More cases were positive in bacterial culture in cases with gastrointestinal perforation (GIP) than without GIP (no statistical difference). However, many cases with GIP were obligated to continued packing for a long duration. There was no relation between bacterial culture and preoperative and operative bleeding ( Figure 1). Conclusions Gauze packing in damage control surgery is thought to be safe within 96 hours from the viewpoint of infection. We cannot determine the relation between bacterial infection and GIP.  We therefore tested its efficacy in a profound hemorrhagic shock model. Rats in both groups receiving pHPP survived significantly longer (P <0.001) than rats receiving vehicle alone. All rats in the vehicle group were dead by 140 minutes. Five out of 12 animals treated with pHPP survived longer than 4 hours and one rat survived for 455 minutes. Prompted by the recognition that pHPP is an endogenous metabolite converted to HGA in the tyrosine catabolism pathway, we sought to determine whether treatment with HGA could extend survival in the same HS model. The percentage of treated rats that survived until 5 hours in groups 2 or 4 was 33.3%. No statistical significance was observed among rats in groups 2, 3, 4. In order to obtain additional information regarding the mechanism responsible for the protective effects, we administered an inhibitor of the tyrosine catabolism, dichloroacetic acid alone or in addition to pHPP. Accordingly, the data showed that all rats in groups 5 or 6 died within 4 hours. Conclusions These findings show that administration of a nanomolar dose of pHPP markedly improves survival following lethal HS. This improvement is very probably related to a direct pharmacologic effect of pHPP on inflammation that is shared with EP and together with pHPP acting as an anaerobic carbon source. Infusion of drug in only 2% of the EBV strongly suggests that these effects are not related to resuscitation.

Introduction Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; Novoseven) is indicated for treatment of bleeding in hemophilic patients with antibodies against factor VIII or factor IX. Although not licensed or agreed for other indications, its use for refractory hemorrhage is increasingly reported. We reviewed our experience with off-label use of rFVIIa in this indication.


## Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with rFVIIa from March 2004 to November 2008 in our hospital. Those included in a multicentric study (n = 10) or treated within approved (n = 3) or nonhemorrhage (n = 4) indications were excluded. Initial use imposed constringent guidelines implementation. According to these, use of rFVIIa requires cross-checking for active correction of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulation factors and consideration for any feasible haemostatic surgery or embolisation.

Results Forty-two patients were included. Median age was 39 years and 60% were male. The underlying condition was trauma in 14% of cases and surgery-associated hemorrhage in 76%.

Bleeding stopped in 79% of cases. Potentially associated thromboembolic complications were observed in five (11.9%) cases, only one being very probably linked to rFVIIa. The overall 30day mortality was 40.5%. The initial experience was followed by a decline in the use of rFVIIa, and the release of guidelines followed by a continuous increase. We observed a progressive decline in the 30-day mortality rate, from 70% in the first 10 patients to 17% in the last 10 ( Figure 1). The average number of blood transfusions before rFVIIa remained stable but the median rFVIIa doses decreased from 206 μg/kg in the first 10 patients to 80 μg/kg in the last 10. Conclusions Local guidelines release did not decrease the number of cases but seem to impact on when and to whom rFVIIa is administered. Their release, associated with increasing experience, was associated with a striking lowering of mortality rate. Results One study has demonstrated that one single dose of rFVIIa (80 μg/kg) could reduce transfusion requirements in cirrhotic patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant. Compared with 29% growth in the placebo arm, intracerebral hemorrhage volume growth in the 40, 80, and 160 μg/kg arms was 16%, 14%, and 11%, respectively (corresponding to a relative reduction of 45%, 52% and 62%).


## P429

Conclusions Use of rFVIIa should be reserved for salvageable patients with coagulopathic bleeding that is unresponsive to existing medical therapies. Definitive surgical control of accessible sites of hemorrhage is nevertheless a necessary intervention.

Introduction Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) plays a key role in hemostasis. The aim of this study was the clinical evaluation of the efficacy of rFVIIa in the treatment of bleeding during and after abdominal and cardiac surgery. Methods A meta-analyses of case-series studies (n = 67) on the treatment of bleeding with rFVIIa regarding reduction or cessation of bleeding and mortality. We used the questioners of Novo Nordisk to assess the indications and effectiveness of treatment. We compared the amount of blood loss within 12 hours before and within 12 hours after giving rFVIIa, and the dynamics of bleeding. In 10 patients the bleeding started after surgery intraoperatively, in 57 patients severe hemorrhage developed in the postoperative period. We also compared the full blood count and laboratory coagulation profile parameters before treatment, and 2 and 12 hours after treatment. In cardiac surgery rFVIIa was administered 5 to 49 minutes after neutralization of heparin with protamine sulfate. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1

Thirty-day mortality after rFVIIa.

Introduction Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; Novoseven) is indicated for treatment of bleeding in hemophilic patients with antibodies against factor VIII or factor IX. Although not licensed or agreed for other use, it is increasingly reported for refractory hemorrhage. Implantation of a circulatory assist device requires tight anticoagulation therapy and may be complicated by massive bleeding. We report our experience with off-label use of rFVIIa in nine patients with circulatory assistance. Conclusions In our establishment, off-licence use of rFVIIa has often been unsuccessful and may have been used as salvage therapy. There is heterogeneity in prescribing rFVIIa and its use does not conform to European guidelines [1]. Controversy continues about the merits of using off-licence rFVIIa at all [2].

Introduction Massive postpartum bleeding remains a major cause of maternal morbidity and death. An estimated 90% of such deaths might be preventable.

Methods rFVIIa was used in our ICU in the treatment of 12 women with severe or life-threatening postpartum bleeding (PPB) in 2005 to 2008 due to placenta previa accrete, rupture of the uterus and pre-eclampsia with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets. The average patient age was 30 years. We used the questioners of Novo Nordisk to assess the indications and effectiveness of treatment. All patients had normal coagulation parameters before surgery. We compared the amount of blood loss within 12 hours before and 12 hours after giving rFVIIa, the dynamics of bleeding (assessed in ml/hour) before and after treatment and coagulation profile parameters. We used small doses of rFVIIa (15.25 to 50 μg/kg). We used Student's t test for statistical analysis of the laboratory data prior to and after rFVIIa.

Results Indications for administration of rFVIIa were considered when sudden blood loss exceeded 1,800 ml or when continuing blood loss of 500 ml/hour (in the drain). Patients after rFVIIa treatment received a lower number of packed red cell transfusions (4.0 ± 4.46 vs. 9.61 ± 6.7, P = 0.007), compared with before treatment. In addition, the median amount of crystalloid/colloids administered decreased markedly. After administration, rFVIIa .05). The association between FVIII:C levels and mortality remained essentially unchanged when considering noncancer mortality, all-cause vascular mortality or mortality due to ischemic heart disease. Compared with males, females with elevated FVIII:C had a worse outcome resulting in higher hazard ratios reaching 6.8 (95% CI = 4.6 to 9.9) within the highest decile compared with males (hazard ratio = 3.4, 95% CI = 2.6 to 4.5).

Conclusions In our large patient cohort we are firstly able to demonstrate that FVIII:C plasma activity is strongly associated with all-cause mortality. Additionally, FVIII:C appears to interact with gender. Especially in women, FVIII:C might help identifying highrisk cohorts that might benefit from individualized prevention strategies.

S176 be detected in healthy and anticoagulated blood. We compared the gel time (GT) required to form the incipient clot and the corresponding fractal dimension (d f ) against laboratory markers of haemostasis and thromboelastography (TEG). Methods Blood samples were taken from 52 healthy adults and similarly 34 individuals whose blood had been anticoagulated with heparin over the therapeutic range.


## Results

The incipient clot in normal blood is established as a sample-spanning network cluster at the GP [2]. The value of d f in whole healthy human blood is 1.74 (±0.07), which indicates a high degree of branching in the fibrin network at criticality and is commensurate with that reported to arise in other biological systems. There was a significant reduction in the value of d f and a corresponding prolongation in the GT in the heparin group as compared with the healthy group ( Figure 1). Conclusions We describe for the first time that the incipient clot formed at the GP of whole blood is characterised by a fractal microstructure. The values of d f and GT discriminate between clot structure in healthy and anticoagulated blood. The relationship between these new markers may provide a basis for exploring the relationship between coagulation pathways and clot quality.

Introduction Severe traumatic or intraoperative blood loss necessitates massive transfusion. This blood loss and the dilution of coagulation factors result in insufficient haemostasis. Treatments to enhance the haemostatic capacity need to be evaluated. An acquired bleeding model due to a dilutional coagulopathy was developed in the rabbit to estimate the contribution of PCC (Beriplex P/N; CSL Behring) on haemorrhage. Methods Rabbits were anesthetised using isofluran and were mandatorily ventilated. The animals were instrumented to monitor the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Dilutional coagulopathy was induced by phased blood withdraw, salvaged erythrocyte retransfusion and volume substitution with hydroxyethyl starch. After the dilutional procedure the bleeding was inflicted by cutting the lateral kidney pole. To characterise the model, animals were allocated to groups: I, sham operation (no dilution, placebo treatment; n = 5); II, negative control (dilution, placebo treatment; n = 7); III, PCC 25 U/kg intravenously (dilution, verum treatment; n = 6). Coagulation factor activity, thrombin generation (TGA), prothrombin time (PT) and the bleeding from the kidney wound were assessed. Introduction Right heart mobile thrombi (RHMT) are not frequent in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (APE); however, bear a significant risk of APE recurrence and hemodynamic compromise. Immediate therapy is recommended, but the optimal approach is considered to be controversial in the absence of controlled trials [1]. Methods We report an analysis of 21 out of 209 (10%) consecutive patients with echocardiographically diagnosed RHMT managed at our institution during the past 5 years. For demographics, vital signs and laboratory values on entry see Table 1.


## Results

Results Eight (38%) out of 21 patients with RHMT presented with massive, 12 (57%) submassive and one with small APE. Right ventricle overload was detected in 20 out of 21 patients (95%). Fifteen (71%) patients were thrombolysed, three (14%) patients have undergone surgical embolectomy. Thrombolysis was successful in 13 out of 15 (87%) patients, RHMT was dislodged in two patients; in one of them with fatal outcome, the other one was Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Disorders of acid-base equilibrium are common in critically ill patients. The Stewart approach has been found useful in explaining these disorders, where conventional analysis was deficient. However, much uncertainty remains about the usefulness and clinical meaning of this new approach. The aim of our study was to compare the traditional method based on the analysis of standard base excess (SBE) and anion gap with the Stewart approach based on the analysis of the independent variables in septic shock. Methods A prospective observational study with all patients admitted to the ICU of our hospital for septic shock between September 2007 and July 2008. Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Cl -, pH, PaCO 2 , lactate, phosphorus, albumin were measured at admission. Bicarbonate, SBE, anion gap corrected for albumin (AGc), Cl corrected for water excess/deficit (Clc), apparent and effective strong ion differences and strong ion gap (SIG) were calculated. Unmeasured anions were identified if SIG >6 mEq/l. Results Thirty-one patients were included. Metabolic acidosis (SBE <-3 mEq/l) was found in 20 (64.5%) patients, while the Stewart approach identified metabolic acidosis in 27 (87%) patients. The traditional approach failed to identify seven cases of metabolic acidosis (five patients considered normal and two having an alkalosis).The inclusion of AGc in the traditional analysis based on SBE resulted in a different clinical interpretation of acid-base status than the Stewart method in only two (6.4%) patients. The Stewart approach did not identify one patient with metabolic acidosis observed with the use of SBE and AGc. Hyperlactatemia (lactate >2 mmol/l) was present in 18 (58%) patients. SIG and AGc were elevated in 25 (81%) and 24 (77.4%) patients. Hypoalbuminemia was found in all patients. Patients with normal SBE and high SIG had lower Clc than patients with low SBE (103.1 ± 2.3 vs. 108 ± 3.6; P = 0.03). Albumin was not different between these two groups. The normal SBE found with high SIG was almost completely explained by the alkalinizing effect of hypochloremia. AGc and SIG showed a very good self-correlation (r 2 = 0.708; P = 0.001). Thirteen patients died before day 28. All metabolic acid-base variables failed to predict outcome. Conclusions The Stewart approach and traditional method associating the AGc are clinically interchangeable in identifying the acid-base disorders in septic shock patients. Because of its simplicity and very good correlation with the complex calculation of SIG, AGc must be used in clinic practice. Critically ill patients may present high SIG with a normal value of SBE as a result of associated hypochloremic alkalosis.


## Introduction

The Stewart approach to acid-base management has evolved to be the method of choice [1]. While the quantitative approach and the traditional Henderson-Hasselbalch method do not mathematically exclude one another, the Stewart approach may provide better mechanistic insight in complex acid-base disturbances. However, the approach is perceived as complex, requiring many calculations. This is why we developed an online tool that may facilitate its use. Methods We programmed several scripts interacting with a MySQL database. Users may reach the application online [2] and must enter acid-base and chemistry data. Cases can be saved anonymously for later review. A tool is provided to run hypothetical scenarios by changing different physiological parameters. The application was tested using historical data from the author's hospital and limited public use.


## Results

The application has been online since January 2008 ( Figure 1). Initial testing led to various improvements. Without advertising, over 500 doctors worldwide have used the software generating a total of 15,000 page-views as of December 2008. Feedback by users is voluntary and indicates multiple changes in diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies. Conclusions We have shown it is feasible to build an online software application that aids in the interpretation of complex acid-base disorders using the Stewart approach. In addition this tool enables the clinician to judge the impact of possible intervention using simulation. We will next set out to investigate the impact of exposure to this decision support tool on clinical patient management.

Introduction Acid-base disorders are common in critically ill patients, and they are generally associated with greater morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study are to find out whether the diagnostic evaluation of acid-base disorders in a population of critically ill patients can be improved using Stewart's method compared with the traditional model, and whether acid-base variables are associated with hospital mortality.

ROC curves for the models including SOFA, age, albumin and chloride.

Methods This prospective observational study took place in a university-affiliated hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil, during the period of February to May 2007. We recorded clinical data and acid-base variables from 175 patients at ICU admission.


## Results

The evaluation according to Stewart's method would allow an additional diagnosis of metabolic disorder in 59 (33.7%) patients. Individually, none of the variables appear to be good predictors of hospital mortality. However, using the multivariate stepwise logistic regression, we had a model with good discrimination containing the SOFA score, age, chloride and albumin (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.73 to 0.87). See Figure 1. Conclusions The Stewart approach, compared with the traditional evaluation, allows identifying more patients with major acid-base disturbances. Hypoalbuminemia and hyperchloremia were associated with mortality.


## Introduction

The current literature does not support buffers in acidosis except when facing proven losses of bicarbonates [1]. However, human studies are lacking and data are supported by in vitro or animal studies that showed the side effects of bicarbonates. The aim of this study was firstly to describe the frequency of buffering therapy in ICU and secondly to compare the outcome between patients treated by buffers (buffer group) or not (nonbuffer group). Methods A prospective, multiple-center, observational study. All patients presenting a severe metabolic or mixed acidosis (pH <7.20) were screened. Acidoketosis was secondarily excluded. The mechanism of acidosis was defined by classical analyses [2]. At admission, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, pH, bicarbonatemia, lactatemia, dialysis, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use were recorded. At ICU discharge, lengths of stay, mechanical ventilation and mortality were recorded. Data are presented as the medians and quartile ranges and compared with the Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests.

Results One hundred and forty-six were included for analysis. The main diagnosis at admission was septic shock (36%) and cardiac arrest (12%). Ninety were not treated with buffers and 56 were treated at day 0. Severity scores at admission (SOFA 10 (7 to 13) vs. 11 (9 to 13) and SAPS II 62 (50 to 81) vs. 71 (54 to 81)), frequency of vasopressors (86% vs. 93%), dialysis (17% vs. 26%) and mechanical ventilation (86% vs. 93%) in the nonbuffer and buffer groups, respectively, were not different. Bicarbonatemia was significantly lower in the buffer group than in the nonbuffer group (15 (10.3 to 18.0) vs. 13.4 (8.0 to 17.0); P <0.05). No significant difference was observed between groups for length of stay in the ICU (5 (3 to 7) vs. 4 (2 to 8) days), length of mechanical ventilation (4 (2 to 5) vs. 3 (2 to 4) days) and mortality (58 vs. 59%) in the nonbuffer and buffer groups respectively. Conclusions In this multiple-center observational study, buffering practices was heterogeneous. Buffering therapy in severe acidosis (pH <7.20) does not seem to influence the ICU outcome. Further clinical studies should be performed to better define the impact of buffering therapy in selected patients in severe acidosis.

Introduction Hypophosphataemia is a common treatable problem in ICU, and is indicative of many pathophysiological processes that occur in critical illness. This audit's objective was to quantify the incidence, severity and timing of hypophosphataemia in the ICU. Namely, the incidence of hypophosphataemia on ICU admission and the incidence that develops following admission. Methods A retrospective audit of data entered into the computerised medical record database (CareVue) from all admissions between 27 April 2006 and 7 July 2008. The time, date and value of all serum phosphate concentrations were analysed. Abnormal phosphate concentrations were categorised as following: critically low (<0.3 mmol/l), low (<0.7 mmol/l), high (>1.5 mmol/l). Results A total 689 out of 795 patients admitted during this period had a serum phosphate recorded. 


## Introduction

The coma patient is a particular and unique patient: he depends completely on the caregivers, more than a neonate. The bed bath of a coma patient is important to maintain his personal hygiene, to clean and refresh, to monitor skin condition and to promote comfort. Modern ICU management must offer a high quality of coma patient care and should be constantly fighting for cost-effective ways of providing that care. Methods The aim of this study was to compare the traditional bedbathing method with the basinless bed-bathing method. The study focused on nurse satisfaction or acceptance, and the costs of two methods. The study comprised 100 baths of coma patients: 50 completed using the Comfort Bath ® (a prepackaged disposable bed bath) and 50 completed using the traditional method. In addition, 30 nurses were recruited and interviewed about their preferences and opinions. The economic study type was costminimization and, in part, cost-effectiveness analysis.

Results For skin softness, administration ease, and nurse satisfaction, there were statistical variations between the two sets of scores, in favour of the Comfort Bath ® method. Nurses expressed a clear and significant preference for the disposable bath, corroborating findings by other investigators [1]. The direct costs were: for the soap, water, laundry, equipment and labour, for the time taken to perform the bed-bathing, for logistics and depreciation. The overall cost was less for the disposable bath due to savings in nurses' time and salary (Table 1). Introduction Weight is frequently required to determine the dose of many medications and is important in quantifying treatments such as haemofiltration and calorific requirement. We present the findings of an audit to determine how frequently a patient's weight is estimated in one ICU and the results of a pilot study to determine the accuracy of an estimated weight in the critically ill patient. Methods A prospective audit of 100 admissions to an ICU was undertaken over a 6-week period. Data were collected from observation charts and hospital notes. Following data analysis a pilot study was undertaken to assess the accuracy of the estimated weight of patients in the ICU. Urine bags and drains were emptied before weighing and the same number of pillows and blankets was ensured on each bed. Due to a short loan period of scales, only 18 patients could be weighed. Seven out of 12 (58%) had a greater than 10% difference between the estimated and true weights. Of the six patients who had a recent accurate weight documented in the notes, the mean difference (precision) between that and the true weight was 5.8 (±4.0) kg. Two out of six (33%) had a greater than 10% difference between estimated and true weights. Conclusions A patient's weight is an important parameter in guiding therapy. A large proportion of ICU patients have their weight estimated. In some cases this is unnecessary as a recent weight can be found in the notes. A more comprehensive study is required to assess the clinical impact of weight estimation on the ICU. Introduction Alcohol misuse is associated with many conditions requiring ICU management [1]. In 2006/2007, 1.53% of all hospital admissions were related to alcohol misuse (regional audit). We conducted a prospective audit in a tertiary referral adult ICU to ascertain the proportion of ICU capacity used for the treatment of conditions related to alcohol misuse. Methods Patients admitted to a tertiary referral ICU between 1 November 2006 and 31 March 2007 were prospectively audited with the aim of identifying all cases in which the reason for admission could be attributed to acute or chronic alcohol misuse. Blood alcohol levels, past history from the patient/relatives or previous relevant clinical investigations and/or diagnoses were reviewed for evidence of acute or chronic alcohol misuse.


## Results


## Results

Of 318 ICU admissions during the audit, 9.43% (30 admissions -20 male/10 female) were judged to be due to either acute (19 of 30) or chronic (11 of 30) alcohol consumption. The mean patient age was 48.7 years (SD 14.1, range 25 to 74). Blood alcohol level on admission to hospital was available in 13 patients (43%), the median value being 170 mg% (IQR = 66 to 274). Seventeen patients (56.6%) were admitted following trauma, of whom 10 (33.3%), had brain injuries. The median length of stay (LOS) in the ICU was 10 days (IQR = 4 to 15) and the median LOS in hospital was 22 days (IQR = 10 to 38). The ICU mortality Introduction The audit was commissioned by the Scottish Government Health Department to identify the number of acutely ill adults transported between hospitals by the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS). Currently interhospital transfer (IHT) of acutely ill adults requiring medical escorts is undertaken by the SAS Accident and Emergency (A&E) ambulances or by dedicated transport teams (for example, Glasgow Shock Team and Emergency Medical Retrieval Service).


## Methods

The audit ran for 20 weeks. Patients over 16 years old who required intervention/vital signs monitoring during transfer or who required a nursing or medical escort were defined as acutely ill. Audit forms were placed in every A&E ambulance. Results A total of 3,068 forms were received, with 2,396 audited. Twenty per cent were emergencies, 73% urgent and 7% planned. The median SAS journey times, patient and dedicated team journey times are presented in Table 1. The majority of IHTs occurred for specialist management (65.9%) or specialist investigation (23%). A total of 820 IHTs were clinically escorted, including the Glasgow Shock Team (n = 192) and the Emergency Medical Retrieval Service (n = 13). Two hundred and forty-eight patients were ventilated (10.3%). Eighty-four (3.5%) IHTs required clinical intervention to correct clinical deterioration. An adverse event occurred in 1.5% (22). One hundred and thirteen (18%) escorted IHTs by nondedicated transport teams had unsecured medical equipment versus 2/205 (0.97%) in dedicated transport teams (P = 0.004). Equipment failures occurred in 9/97(9.2%) ventilated transfers by nondedicated teams versus 1/156 (0.6%) by dedicated teams (P = 0.001). The SAS executive information service data showed a total number of IHTs during the audit period conveyed by A&E ambulances as 19,747 (18,343 adults). This approximates to a total of 51,342 per annum (47,692 adults) or 917 adults per week. Conclusions The most frequent reason for IHT is specialist management or investigation. Adverse events are reassuringly uncommon. Unsecured medical equipment and equipment failure during an IHT is significantly more frequent when undertaken by nondedicated transport teams.

Introduction Patients who undergo transfer to the ICU of an academic referral centre represent a group of sicker patients with increased risk for grim prognosis than those admitted directly. These patients' weight in terms of increased resource utilization is, however, less studied. This study aimed to compare the outcome and resource consumption between directly admitted patients and those transferred from a peripheral hospital to the ICU of a large tertiary-care referral centre.

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 were retained for analysis. Severity of illness by means of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, length of stay (LOS), and outcomes were gathered per admission. Data are presented as numbers (%) or as mean ± standard deviation. All statistical tests were performed as appropriate. The level of significance was set at P <0.05. Results Crude comparison of directly admitted (n = 500) versus transfer patients (n = 85) revealed that transfer patients had significantly higher severity of illness as expressed by the admission, mean, and maximum SOFA score (P = 0.042, P = 0.034, and P = 0.005), but not by the APACHE II score (P = 0.422), respectively. Transfer patients necessitated higher resource consumption as defined by the need for mechanical ventilation (P <0.001), vasopressor therapy (P = 0.01), medical imaging (respectively, CT or MRI) (P <0.001), urgent surgical intervention during their stay in the ICU (P <0.001), sedative drugs (P <0.001), and tracheostomy placement (P <0.001) compared with directly admitted patients, whereas no significant differences were found regarding need for renal replacement therapy (P = 0.47) and blood transfusion (P = 0.41), respectively. A significant increased ICU LOS (8.6 ± 11.1 days vs. 4.9 ± 7.4 days, P <0.01) was observed for transferred patients, whereas no difference was found for hospital LOS (23.6 ± 27.4 days vs. 24.5 ± 25.7 days, P = 0.81). When comparing both groups, those transferred from other hospitals were found to have worse outcome as demonstrated by higher ICU and inhospital mortality rates (16.5% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.03, and 29.6% vs. 14.5%, P = 0.002). Even after adjustment for severity of illness, being transferred was found to be independently associated with higher inhospital mortality (OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.41 to 5.72) (receiver operating characteristic = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.83 to 0.91, P <0.001) (Hosmer and Lemeshow, chi-square, 6.27; degrees of freedom, 8; P = 0.617).

Conclusions Patients transferred to the ICU of a tertiary-care referral centre generally consume more resources and have worse outcome as compared with directly admitted patients. Methods A prospective, observational study including 25 consecutive elective cardiac surgery patients. In all patients a predefined alarm setting was used. During 25 surgical procedures, all incoming patient data and alarms from the monitor and the anesthetic workstation were digitally recorded. Additionally, the anesthesiological workplace was filmed from two different views to assess reaction to the alarms. All events of alarming were retro-spectively annotated. Alarms were categorized: valid/not valid, relevant/not relevant and medical reaction yes/no. Alarms were annotated as relevant if measurement was technically correct and showed a threshold violation. Alarms were relevant if there was a need for medical reaction.


## P468

Results During 124 hours of recording, 9,460 alarms in 48 categories were registered. A total of 3,054 (32%) alarms were of technical origin or static alarms and were not considered. The remaining 6,406 alarms were further analyzed. In total, 1,954 alarms were not valid and not relevant. A total of 4,452 alarms were valid (69%), 1,742 of these were clinically relevant and induced a reaction of the physician, 1,773 were relevant without a reaction of the physician. About 65% of the considered alarms were threshold violations (48% blood pressure). Nine hundred and thirty-seven alarms were valid but not relevant.

Conclusions Approximately 80% of the total 9,460 alarms had no therapeutic consequences. Thirty-one per cent of the considered alarms were annotated as not valid. Sixty-nine per cent of the considered alarms were valid alarms, separated into 39% relevant alarms, 21% nonrelevant alarms and 40% relevant alarms without reaction of the physician. The majority of the static alarms occurred during the use of the extracorporeal circulation. Implementation of procedure-specific settings and optimization in artefact or technical alarm detection could improve patient surveillance and safety.

Second-day discharge from the ICU after non-emergency cardiac surgery  Introduction Patient outcome has been linked to the timing of the first senior medical review in emergency medical admissions to hospital, and after ICU admission [1,2]. The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) 2005 report revealed that in participating UK ICUs 75% of new ICU patients had a consultant intensivist review within 12 hours of admission [3]. This is now a recommended standard, although data were only available for 40% of patients, and neither supportive patient outcome data nor pre-ICU review timings were cited. Methods By retrospective review of patients' ICU medical notes, we studied the length of time in hours to first consultant intensivist review before and after ICU admission in 122 consecutive patients. We also examined mortality and length of stay (LOS) outcomes in patients reviewed early (<12 hours) and late (>12 hours) after ICU admission. Continuous data are expressed as the median (IQR). Results Overall, data were available for 96 patients reviewed after ICU admission (median = 6.0, IQR = 1.1 to 14.7 hours), 79 (82%) of these reviews being early (median = 3, IQR = 0.5 to 7.5). ICU mortality for the early group was 31.6% during a median ICU LOS of 1.8 days (IQR = 0.9 to 7.9). Median review time for the late group (n = 17) was 21 hours (IQR = 18.5 to 28.4), with an ICU mortality of 23.5%, during a median ICU LOS of 8.1 days (IQR = 2.1 to 14). The early group had a significantly shorter ICU LOS (P = 0.007, two-sided Mann-Whitney test) than the late group, and there was no significant proportional difference in ICU mortality between the two groups. Furthermore, before ICU admission, 56/122 patients (46%) had been reviewed by a consultant intensivist (median = 2.2, IQR = 1.2 to 4.0 hours), and in many patients this constituted the only such review prior to 12 hours into ICU admission. Conclusions Review by a consultant intensivist is common before ICU admission. Early review after ICU admission may be Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1

## Introduction

The outcome of ICU treatment is improved in highvolume compared with low-volume ICUs [1]. It is unclear whether transfer of patients from a low-volume to a high-volume ICU (upgrading) improves outcome and whether early transfer is beneficial.

Methods In a retrospective cohort study the timing of upgrading was determined and related to mortality. Included were all upgraded patients transported to our level 3 ICU between 2002 and 2008. The APACHE II score was determined in the first 24 hours after admission to the high-volume ICU. Odds ratios, the Mann-Whitney test and multiple regression were performed. Results Three hundred and eighty-five patients were included with a mean age of 62 years (SD = 14.8) and mean APACHE II score of 22.5 (SD = 8.4). The median time to transfer was 1 day (IQR = 4). Patients transported immediately after stabilisation to the highvolume ICU (ICU length of stay (LOS) before transfer = 0) had a mortality rate of 9% (Figure 1). Mortality in patients with ICU LOS before transport >0 was 25% (P <0.001). In a multiple regression analysis a higher APACHE II score was associated with increased mortality (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.2), as was APACHE II predicted mortality. Immediate transfer was associated with a decrease in ICU mortality (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.80) and hospital mortality (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.95). In patients with upgrading as the explicit reason for transport the findings were the same (OR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.71).

Conclusions In this retrospective cohort study patients who were immediately transferred from a low-volume to a high-volume level 3 ICU had a lower mortality compared with patients with delayed transfer, which was independent of the APACHE score. 


## Introduction

The present study aims to compare the diagnostic categories and outcomes for teenagers admitted to the paediatric ICU (PICU) and the adult ICU over a 3-year period. The UK Paediatric Intensive Care society has agreed consensus standards for the care of critically ill patients up to the age of 16 years [1]. The UK National Service Framework for Children defines a child as 'all those under 19 years' [2]. To date, there are no specific national standards addressing the care of teenagers on intensive care. Methods All patients aged between 16 and 19 years of age admitted to both the adult ICU and the PICU were retrospectively enrolled between January 2005 and June 2008. A revised version of the Paediatric Index of Mortality (PIM2) was used to calculate predicted mortality in the two groups. Results A total of 50 and 46 patients aged between 16 and 19 years were admitted to the adult ICU and the PICU, respectively. The average predicted risk of mortality for those aged 16 to 19 years on the adult ICU was 3.98% and the actual mortality was comparable at 4%. On the PICU, the average predicted risk of mortality for those aged 16 to 19 years was 5.23% and the actual mortality for this age group was higher than predicted at 6.52%. On the PICU, 50% of the total admissions had a primary diagnosis of congenital disorder followed by 13% with neuromuscular disorders. On the adult ICU, trauma accounted for 31% of total admissions, followed by diabetic ketoacidosis at 17%. Interestingly, self-harm/overdose accounted for 11.5% of teenage admissions to the adult ICU compared with none on the PICU.


## Conclusions

The outcomes for patients aged 16 to 19 years are similar in both the PICU and the adult ICU; however, there is significant variation in the diagnostic profile. Further larger-scale studies are needed to develop a standardised and pragmatic approach to this age group of patients.

## Figure 1 (abstract P480)

Introduction Families of critically ill patients spend a considerable amount of time in hospital, both beside their loved ones in the ICU and outside the unit waiting to visit them or to receive news. No published data are available to date on the provision of waiting rooms in Italy's pediatric ICUs (PICUs) and on the facilities available to patients' families and visitors. We investigated these aspects in the course of a national survey concerning visiting policies in Italian PICUs. Methods An email questionnaire was sent to the heads of all 34 Italian PICUs asking about their visiting policies. Questions about waiting rooms and facilities for patients' families and visitors were also included.


## Results

The response rate was 100%. The median daily visiting time was 300 minutes (range 30 minutes to 24 hours). No waiting room was provided in 32% of PICUs. In other PICUs, families and visitors were provided with seats (50% of PICUs), armchairs (32%), lockers for personal effects (32%), magazines and books (18%), drinks machines (15%) and snack machines (6%). A bathroom was available to families and visitors in 41% of units, use of the PICU's kitchen in 3% and access to the hospital canteen in 47%.

Conclusions Overall these data indicate that in Italian PICUs, alongside a clear tendency to apply restricted visiting policies, there is limited attention to the comfort of families of patients in the PICU. Comfort is one of five domains (in addition to reassurance, proximity, information and support) associated with the needs of families who have critically ill loved ones [1,2]. Our survey could contribute to promoting more attentive and supportive care for the patient's family [3].

Introduction To optimize patient care, knowledge of patient satisfaction and its determinants is essential. So far few researchers have focused on this subject in intensive care medicine. The purpose of this study was to measure the level of patient satisfaction and determine its influencing factors in ICU patients.

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction As overall survival times increase for patients with cancer due to novel antitumour treatments, there will be an inevitable escalation in the number of such patients who present to intensive care with intercurrent acute illness, and sepsis is the most frequent diagnosis in this context. Epidemiologic estimates of sepsis among cancer patients are limited. The aim of this study was to assess survival in cancer patients admitted to an ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, trying to identify predictive factors of mortality.

Methods A prospective cohort study in an ICU at a university cancer referral center. From a total of 95 patients admitted to the ICU during a period of 3 months, 78 patients had the diagnosis of sepsis into 24 hours of admission. Patient charts were analyzed with respect to underlying disease, cause of admission, APACHE II score, need and duration for mechanical ventilation, neutropenia and development of septic shock, type of infection, time to antibiotic therapy, as well as ICU survival and survival after discharge. Results ICU survival of septic patients was 76%, and 1-month survival was 66%. In a multivariate analysis, prognosis was negatively influenced by respiratory insufficiency, the need for mechanical ventilation, and development of septic shock and renal failure after 72 hours of ICU stay. Admission after cardiopulmonary resuscitation yielded high ICU mortality. Age, neutropenia, type of infection, and underlying disease did not influence outcome significantly. Admission APACHE II scores were significantly higher in nonsurvivors but failed to predict individual outcome satisfactorily.

Conclusions A combination of factors must be taken into account to estimate a critically ill cancer patient's prognosis in the ICU admitted because of sepsis. The APACHE II scoring system alone should not be used to make decisions about therapy prolongation. As ICU mortality is 24%, comparable with severely ill noncancer patients, general reluctance to admit cancer patients to an ICU does not seem to be justified.

terized by an extensive skin rash with blisters and exfoliation similar to that of major burns. This study presents our experience of treating and management of TEN in a burn center. Methods We retrospectively analysed the charts of all patients with severe skin disease admitted to the burn center of Tunis between 2001 and 2008. The patients were evaluated according to their history of pre-existing diseases and medication, suspected cause, extent of skin involvement (TBSA), mucosal involvement, definitive diagnosis, therapy, complications and outcome. Results were collected and examined with SPSS 16.0 software. Results During the study period, 21 patients with severe bullous skin disease were admitted. Fifteen of them had TEN (three patients per year). All patients were referred from outside institutions, especially from dermatology departments, mean hospital duration of 4 ± 2 days. The group of 15 patients consisted of 10 women and five men. The average age was 50 ± 17 years. The average affected skin area was 49 ± 15% of TBSA. The suspected causal agent was aspirin in three cases, phenobarbital in three cases, allopurinol in three cases, antibiotics in two cases and paracetamol in one case. It was unknown in three cases. It was medical prescription in 10 cases, automedication in three cases and unknown in two cases. The mean time delay between drug intake and the onset of symptoms was 4.5 ± 1.5 days.

Mucosal involvement was observed in all patients, such as ocular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and genital localizations. The most common complications ware: sepsis, ARDS and hematological disorders (two pancytopenia and one CIVD). The mean duration of hospitalization was 9 ± 6 days. The overall mortality rate was 30%.

There was a significant statistical difference between survival and nonsurviving patients, in involved skin area (P = 0.04) and septic complications (P <0.001). Conclusions TEN is a severe mucocutaneous reaction, associated with high morbidity and mortality. Management of theses patients must be provided cautiously by an experienced interdisciplinary team in an ICU. Introduction Pesticide poisoning constitutes a problem that often occurs in the daily medical practice and mainly concerns the rural areas of Greece. The purpose of this project is to mention the epidemic characteristics and our observations on unintentional pesticide and herbicide poisonings in the prefecture of Rodopi, Greece. Methods In our retrospective study that refers to a period of 2 years (January 2006 to December 2007), 152 patients suffering from pesticide poisoning were offered medical treatment in the pathologic ward of the General Hospital of Komotini. One hundred and nineteen (78.30%) of them were patients who unintentionally suffered pesticide poisoning. The remaining 20 (13.15%) were poisoned with pharmaceutical substances of domestic use. There were also 13 (8.55%) cases of attempted suicide with intentional intake of an overdose of antidepressants that were exempt from our study. Results Fourteen out of the 119 patients (11.76%) were transferred to hospital in a state of a coma (Glasgow coma scale <8) and were treated in the ICU and underwent blood refinery. There were two deaths (2/119 or 1.68%). The average age of our patients was 37 years (14 to 89). The proportion of men/women was 2.4/1 (84/35) and the poisonings took place at the beginning of the summer. Conclusions Unintentional pesticide poisonings are frequent in our area. They concern people of low educational level, mainly men of a reproductive age [1,2]. The time spent from the intake of the pesticide to their transfer to hospital plays an important role in the successful treatment of such cases [3]. Moreover, for a positive outcome in these severe cases it is essential that these patients are treated in ICUs [3,4].

## Introduction

We reviewed clinical characterization of patients with organophosphate poisoning admitted to the ICU as well as the mortality rate [1]. Methods A retrospective study, without need for local ethical committee approval, of patients with organophosphate poisoning who were admitted to the ICU between 2004 and 2008. Sociodemographic data, psychiatric history, the organophosphate compound, time elapsed since ingestion, clinical presentation and complications, laboratory data, Simplified Acute Physiology score (SAPS) II and treatment approach were analyzed. Biomarkers used on admission: serum cholinesterase level, arterial pH and lactic acid. The influence of obidoxime and atropine therapy on the patient outcome was also analyzed. Results Twenty patients were admitted to the ICU. Dimethoate was the compound most often involved, in which 55% of the patients were females. The mean age recorded was 54.3 ± 14.7 years. The time between exposure and treatment initiation was not quantified in 65% of patients, but when discriminated it was in the majority of cases less than 1 hour. Clinical muscarinic signs in 85% of the cases, nicotinic signs in 55% and central nervous signs in 95%. An intermediate syndrome was identified in one case. Most frequent complications identified were pneumonitis 85%, miocarditis 35% and renal failure 50% of the patients. The mean SAPS II value was 36.6 ± 16.9. Selective decontamination and treatment with obidoxime (continuous intravenous infusion after the loading dose) and atropine was verified in every patient ( Figure 1). The total ICU mortality was 40%.

Conclusions Clinical severity and serum cholinesterase levels and acidosis were the independent variables that mostly seemed to have contributed for the final result. High doses of atropine seemed to be more favorable to a good outcome. Even though the number of patients included in this review was small, the results may alert us to the importance of an organized approach helped by protocols between the emergency department/emergency room Introduction The present study intended to identify and analyze the significance of drug-drug interaction (DDI) in critically ill patients.  LOS, length of stay; CRP, C-reactive protein; ER, emergency room. Introduction Recently introduced interventions including early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) improve the mortality of severe sepsis/septic shock. We undertook this study to describe the trend in the mortality rate of vasopressor-dependent septic shock over a 10 year-period. Methods We used the APACHE III database of our institution to identify patients with septic shock. Patients with an ICU admission diagnosis of infection and who were on a vasopressor on the first ICU day were considered to have vasopressor-dependent septic shock. We divided the study period into pre-EGDT (1997 to 2000), transit (2001,2002), and post-EGDT (2003 to 2006). We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) with the 95% confidence interval.


## Methods


## Results

Of 53,096 admissions, 4,981 (9.4%) had a diagnosis of infection. The hospital mortality rates of the patients with and without infection were 21.2% and 9.3%, respectively (P <0.001).

Vasopressor was infused in 1,340 (26.9%) of the patients with infection. The hospital mortality rate of the vasopressor-receiving patients with infection was 32.4% compared with 17.1% of those who did not receive vasopressor (P <0.001). The SMR of the vasopressor-dependent septic patients was lowest during the post-EGDT period (Table 1).

Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Introduction Admission to the ICU and the appropriate selection of patients improved the treatment and survival rates of critical oncological patients [1]. Infection is an important complication in these patients, which frequently leads to acute organ dysfunction and even death [2,3]. The objective is to evaluate the outcome and prognostic factors in a group of patients with severe sepsis and solid tumours. Methods A retrospective observational study of collected data in 140 consecutive admissions to the ICU over a 24-month period at our oncological hospital; 108 patients were evaluated, corresponding to 140 admissions to the ICU (19.5% of total admissions). Results Age, sex, the underlying disease and tumour stage (TNM classification), type of previous anticancer treatment, performance status, severity scores (APACHE II, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), ICU and hospital mortalities and hospital outcome at 3, 6 and 12 months were analysed. The majority were male with median age 64.5 years; 26% had head and neck tumours, 21% oesophagus and gastric cancers, 16% colon and rectum cancer, 9% breast cancer, 1% genitourinary tumours and 14% other solid tumours; 91.4% of patients required mechanical ventilation, 42% vasopressors, and 4% kidney replacement therapy. Decisions to forgo (withhold or withdraw) life-sustaining therapies were taken in 19% of patients.

In the patients with the intention to treat, the ICU and hospital survival rates were 76.5% and 56.3%. Survival rates at 3, 6 and 12 months were 97%, 81% and 45%, respectively. Conclusions Severity scores (APACHE II, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) in the first 24 hours did not discriminate clearly between survivors and nonsurvivors [1]. Mortality for cancer patients with severe sepsis turned out to be unrelated to age [4]. Clinical judgment between oncologists and intensive care physicians is necessary to improve the selection of patients who might benefit from intensive care [5]. Long-term survival is predicted by cancer disease-prognostic factors.

logistical regression models. To investigate trends in mortality independent of demographic changes in the ICU population, expected deaths based on the age-sex mortality experience across the whole 12-year period were calculated for each year. Expected mortality rates based on APACHE II probability of death scores were also calculated for each year. Results In total 7,158 patients were included in this study. There was no significant trend in median age across the 12 years studied; however, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of ICU patients over the age of 80. In 1996, 6% were over 80 years old and by 2008 it was 12.5%. There was no significant trend in the sex distribution of ICU patients (60:40 male to female). The LOS for medical and emergency surgical patients is similar, with an average of 6 days. However, the LOS of elective surgical patients has increased from around 3 to 4 days. The median APACHE II probability of death for ICU patients increased over the period, the significant linear trend (P = 0.001, logistic regression) showing an increase of almost 1% per year. The hospital mortality over the study period was 20%. During this period mortality rates rose in correlation with predicted mortality, before starting a downward trend in 2003 to eventually fall below APACHE II predicted levels in 2007.


## Conclusions

The average age of ICU admissions is not significantly increasing over time. However, the proportion of patients aged over 80 has almost doubled to 12.5%. The severity of illness has increased and this is seen across all categories of admission, but seems to be due particularly to an increase in the subgroup of over 80 year olds. There has been no consistent change in mortality rates over the 12-year period.  [2]. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the independent prognostic factors for mortality were respiratory failure, cardiovascular failure and renal failure.


## P501

Conclusions SAP patients are characterized by advanced age, high APACHE II score and organ failure, and their death is mainly due to multiple organ/systemic failures. In patients with SAP, respiratory, cardiovascular and renal failure can predict the fatal outcome and more attention must be paid to their clinical evaluation.

Introduction Organ dysfunction is usually evaluated by gravity scores (Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score, Multi-Organ Dysfunction Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), aimed to predict the patient's hospital outcome [1,2]. Despite their diffusion, these scores do not provide indications about the treatment's efficacy for each patient. Our aim was to utilize the previous organ dysfunction scores to perform early strategies to preserve organ function. This study tested the following hypothesis: first, that the previous organ dysfunction scores can detect clustering of organ dysfunctions; second, that each clustering could have an own sequence; and, finally, that we can develop a model to predict from the scores at ICU admittance the organ dysfunctions after the seventh day.

to evaluate the ability of nonspecific scores (APACHE II and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II) to predict outcome in SA in a medical ICU.

Methods A prospective and monocentric study during 8 years (2000 to 2007) included all patients who were admitted to our unit for SA. Demographic and clinical data were collected at admission. We collected also therapeutic aspects in all patients. Daily, a followup of the SS value was calculated with their average. We defined a subgroup that has been mechanically ventilated to evaluate the value of SS in SA, because mechanical ventilation is a main prognostic factor among others. Modulus evaluation required a discriminative application using receiver operating characteristic curves. The statistic analysis has been based on SPSS 11.0 for windows. Results A total of 246 cases of SA (9.7% of all patients admitted in our unit) have been counted during the duration of study. The mean value of APACHE II and of SAPS II was 8 ± 5 and 20 ± 10, respectively. The mortality rate was 12%. Conclusions In these preliminary results, no differences were observed comparing SAPS 3 and APACHE II in the mortality prediction from liver, renal and pulmonary transplanted patients.


## Introduction

The aim of this study was to determine inter-rater reliability of APACHE II scores between an ICU specialist and a well-trained ICU fellow.

Methods In a prospective observational study, two raters collect APACHE II scores on 50 consecutive patients in a medical ICU respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for the APACHE II total score, the APACHE II component scores, and the Glasgow coma scale components. Concordance correlation coefficients for each chosen value of the APACHE II component were assessed.

Results Mean (standard deviation) APACHE II scores were 21.6 (8.2) for the specialist, and 21.7 (7.1) for the fellow. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.848 for the APACHE II total score. Within the score components, the inter-rater reliabilities of acute physiology score, age, and chronic health evaluation were 0.860, 0.987, and 0.645, respectively. See Table 1. Further analysis of each chosen value of the APACHE II component found the lowest reliability for the mean artery pressure, which was 0.482. Further investigation discovered that the most common reason for interrater difference is data dropout. 


## Conclusions

The agreements of the APACHE II score among the two collectors was good, but there were more differences in collecting the value of mean artery pressure, for which the original data could not be read directly from medical chart.

Validation of Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Simplified Acute Physiology Score III as mortality and morbidity risk models Introduction Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and SAPS III are valuable scoring systems used to predict the risk of mortality in the ICU. The main purposes of this study were to assess the strength of both the scores in predicting the mortality Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1

S204 risk, to check which one gained the best performance, and to ascertain whether they also achieved a good level of morbidity risk prediction in our patient population. Methods Two hundred and forty-one patients (82 female, 159 male, mean age 53 ± 23), out of 393 admitted to our ICU over 12 months, were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were age <18, and ICU stay <24 hours. SAPS II and SAPS III were prospectively collected. The derived probability of death was calculated according to the original descriptions. To evaluate the capability of morbidity risk prediction of these scoring models, the GIVITI definitions (Italian Group for the Evaluation of Interventions in the ICU) of organ dysfunction and failure were used. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated.

Results Median values for SAPS II and SAPS III were 35 and 58, respectively. Mortality and morbidity rates resulted 16% and 40.5%, respectively. The mean ICU stay was 9 ± 10 days. Although the univariate analysis found similar statistical significances (P <0.001) for both the scores, at the multivariate analysis only SAPS II maintained a statistical significance (P <0.001) in predicting the probability of death. Moreover, SAPS II showed a significantly higher AUC (0.91 vs. 0.73, SAPS II vs. SAPS III, respectively, P <0.05). With respect to morbidity, the AUC of both the scores gained a poor level of predictive power (AUCs = 0.618 and 0.605, SAPS II and SAPS III, respectively). However, in the subgroup of patients admitted to our ICU for major trauma (41% of patients), SAPS III reached a high degree of discriminative strength in predicting the morbidity rate (AUC = 0.81, P <0.01).

Conclusions SAPS II seemed a suitable tool in predicting the risk of death, but not morbidity. Conversely, SAPS III, even though it did not gain a sufficient degree of predictive power toward mortality, could be a useful morbidity risk model when applied to major trauma patients. In our ICU, SAPS II and SAPS III are not interchangeable, but they should be carefully used in the right circumstances. This might avoid the pitfalls leading to errors in forecasting mortality and morbidity risk. Introduction Scoring systems represent classification systems or point systems that have been designed for making quantitative statements regarding the severity of a disease, its course and its prognosis [1]. These systems are based on physiologic abnormalities and have been successful in measuring severity of illness among critically ill patients [2]. The APACHE IV system has already been validated in our population at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center [3], and the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of this system in a subset of patients with acute renal failure. Methods Fifty-four consecutive patients with acute renal failure defined as a creatinine value ≥1.5 mg/dl and urine output <410 ml/24 hours were admitted to a medical/surgical ICU between January 2007 and March 2008 and were enrolled in the study. The length of stay and mortality percentages were predicted using APACHE IV, and both variables were compared with the observed data. The Wilcoxon rank sum test is used to calculate statistical significance for continuous data and the chi-square test for categorical data.

Results A total of 54 patients with mean age of 53.8 years were included. Fifty-six percent were males; 62% of patients were medical, 38% were surgical. The predicted ICU length of stay of 6.3 days (SD = 2, range of 2.1 to 10.2) was insignificantly lower than the observed ICU length of stay of 8.0 days (SD = 8.5, range of 1 to 45) (P <0.12: Wilcoxon test for nonparametric) (Figure 1). The observed mortality of 44.4% was not statistically different from predicted mortality of 42.1 (χ 2 = 0.07, P = 0.8) (Figure 2). The standardized mortality ratio is 1.06 (P = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.7 to 1.5).


## Conclusions

The APACHE IV predicted mortality and length of stay equations perform well in a subset of patients with acute renal failure in our population. Observed and predicted length of stay (LOS).

derived was calibrated and validated two decades ago. Due to substantial advancement in critical care, a new cohort was studied recently and APACHE IV was derived for benchmarking ICU performance. The objective of the study is to compare APACHE II with APACHE IV outcome prediction in the same cohort of critically ill population.


## Methods

The study was carried out in a 40-bed mixed medicalsurgical, adult, semiclosed ICU at a tertiary-care centre. All consecutive patients from January 2007 to October 2008 were studied. Patient demography was recorded. APACHE II and APACHE IV scores were calculated on each patient and statistical comparison was performed.

Results During the study period the total ICU admission was 3,647 patients. Patients with limitation of life support and discharge against medical advice were excluded. Cases where data were incomplete were also excluded, and 2,919 patients were finally analyzed. The median APACHE II and APACHE IV scores of the study cohort were 12 (8 to 18) and 44 (30 to 62). The median predicted mortality over the study period was significantly higher with APACHE II scoring in comparison with APACHE IV (15 (8 to 25) vs. 4.6 (1.66 to 12.67)) (P = 0.00001). The standardized mortality ratio was likewise significantly lower with APACHE II in comparison with APACHE IV (median = -0.87 vs. 2.85, mean = -1.13 vs. 8.18) ( Figure 1) (P = 0.00001). Conclusions Currently, APACHE II benchmarking overestimates ICU performance and APACHE IV might be more relevant tool to estimate ICU performance.

Validation of the APACHE IV scoring system in patients with severe sepsis and comparison with the APACHE II system Introduction APACHE IV is a successful scoring system assessing severity of illness and prognosis of ICU patients [1]. It has been evaluated and validated in our patients for mortality outcome [2]. The objective of this study was to validate the APACHE IV benchmark for patients admitted with severe sepsis and septic shock to the ICU and to compare the performance of the APACHE IV system with APACHE II. Methods In a cohort study at a tertiary-care medical-surgical ICU with a total of 35 acute-care beds, we included all ICU patients with the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock between 1 January 2007 and 29 February 2008 from a prospectively collected ICU database. Observed mortality rates were compared with predicted mortality rates for both the APACHE II and APACHE IV scoring systems, and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were determined. The mortality percentages were predicted using the APACHE IV system and were compared with the observed data. The chi-square test is used to calculate statistical significance for categorical data.

Results One hundred and seventy-two patients were included in the study with an average age of 48.9 years, 53% of patients were males and 47% were females with observed mortality of 33.1%. The average APACHE II score was 20.7 with predicted mortality of 39.9% and SMR 0.83 (95% CI = 0.63 to 1.06, P = 0.15) compared with an average APACHE IV score of 73.1 with predicted mortality of 32.2% and SMR of 0.99 (95% CI = 0.78 to 1.32, P = 0.82) (Figure 1). The hospital mortality calibration curve for APACHE IV shows good calibration, with the line of perfect fit agreement lying within the 95% CI for all the risk ranges. P values of more than 0.05 in all risk ranges confirm adequate calibration.

Although the curve shows that observed mortality differs from expected in the ranges of 20 to 40%, there is no statistical significance for its deviations from perfect fit (Figure 2).

hending physical functioning, general health, and social functioning, is useful to evaluate HQRL after major trauma [3]. Methods One hundred and twenty-one patients were admitted to an emergency department ICU in 2007 with major trauma (injury severity score >15) and severe to moderate brain injury (Glasgow coma scale <13). Of these, 25 died in the days following trauma. Thirty-four of these were evaluated, during the follow-up visit, 6 months after discharge from the ICU. HRQL was assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire. At admission to the ICU, from the ICU database (FileMaker Pro 5.5v2; FileMaker, Inc., USA) with authorization of the Careggi Teaching Hospital Committee of the Emergency Department, the following parameters were collected for every patient: age, sex, abbreviated injury scale, injury severity score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, in the field Glasgow coma scale, Marshall score at the first head CT, worst values of lactates and ScvO 2 within 24 hours from trauma. Also, the length of sedation and ICU stay were collected. The mean summarized SF-36 was related with the Pearson test to the other parameters.


## Results

Only lactate levels showed a significant correlation with the mean summarized SF-36 (y = -0.0035x + 4.83; R = 0.59; P = 0.007).

Conclusions In the patients affected by major trauma and brain traumatic injury, the HRQL appears to be related to the severity of the clinical picture on the first day of trauma assessed by lactate levels regardless of the length of ICU stay and sedation.

Introduction ICU treatment of surgical patients comes along with major disadvantages that have to be justified by an acceptable short-term and long-term outcome. Short-term effects of ICU treatment have been well documented, but this is the first study to describe the long-term effect in a large cohort after surgical ICU admission on survival.

Methods Of all surgical patients admitted to the ICU of a single hospital between 1995 and 2000, patient characteristics, disease category, APACHE II score and survival were prospectively registered. A continuous follow up until 6 to 11 years after discharge was achieved.

Results Of the 1,822 patients included, 936 (51%) had died. Fiftytwo patients were lost to follow up. Overall ICU and inhospital mortalities were 11% and 16%. Age, gender, APACHE II score and surgical diagnosis were independently associated with long-term survival. Mortality increased with age of admittance to the ICU, whereas female patients had a lower chance of dying ( Figure 1). Long-term mortality rates in various surgical diagnostic groups varied between 29% for trauma and 70% for oncological patients. In gastrointestinal, oncological, general surgical and/or high-aged patients this negative effect even exceeds 5 years. In general, 10 years after ICU discharge the survival was only 50%. The mortality ratio was increased twofold in comparison with the general population. Conclusions Survival after ICU treatment follows distinct patterns in which age, gender, surgical diagnosis and APACHE II score are independent determinants. A negative effect of an ICU stay appears to be long lasting.

3 ± 15.6% after NIV, P = 0.02; FEV1/FVC 68.5 ± 17.1 basal, 59.3 ± 15.2 after NIV, P = 0.007. Compared with the basal value, arterial carbon dioxide pCO 2 was significantly decreased: 68.0 ± 2.5 mmHg (basal), 55.3 ± 4.5 mmHg (after NIV), P <0.02; and arterial oxygen was increased: 50.0 ± 14.2 mmHg (basal), 56.3 ± 15.3 mmHg (after NIV).

In 89 (63.6%) patients, the post-ICD CXR showed good position of the drain with improvement in pathology, in 31 (22.1%) patients an inadequate ICD position was noted, in 17 (12.1%) patients significant retained haemothoraces were shown and in three (2.1%) patients poor lung expansion was detected. The post-ICD CXR contributed to change in management in 29 (20.7%) of the cases. Twenty-two (15.7%) patients required a change in position of the tube, six (4.3%) had surgery performed, and one (0.7%) patient had their conservative treatment escalated. Four (2.9%) patients should have had their tubes adjusted. Conclusions Routine usage of post-ICD CXR contributes to a change in management in one out of five trauma patients. Reference 1.

m 2 ). Analysis according to Bland-Altman demonstrated a mean bias of -0.036 ± 0.778 l/min m 2 (lower and upper limits of agreement -1.56 and 1.49 l/min m 2 ; percentage error of 38%). The difference of PC-CO and TD-CO was not correlated to the time-lag to the last calibration (P = 0.257; r = -0.083 for uncorrected difference; P = 0.067; r = 0.134 for absolute values of the difference). Further analysis demonstrated that the absolute value of the differences correlated to TD-CO (P = 0.02, r = 0.226). Subgroup analysis of 160 measurements with CO-TD <5.5 l/min m 2 demonstrated an improved bias of 0.085 ± 0.53 l/min m 2 (lower/upper limits of agreement: -0.98 and 1.12 l/min m 2 ) and a percentage error of 28%.Conclusions PiCCO-2-derived PC-CO and TD-CO are highly significantly correlated. Accuracy is not influenced by the time-lag to the last calibration. Similar to previous data, PC-CO might overestimate very high CO, which usually does not influence clinical practice. Recalibration should be considered in patients with markedly increased PC-CO.


Differences between baseline and 120-minute values of the same solution were significant only for the colloids: mean arterial pressure (MAP): HES 9%, HA 6%; central venous pressure (CVP): GEL 14%, HES 28%, HA 19%; cardiac index (CI): GEL 15%, HES 29%, HA 20%; global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI): GEL 6%, HES 17%, HA 11%; stroke volume variation (SVV): GEL -12%, HES -15%, HA -25%; oxygen delivery index (DO 2 I): GEL 10%, HES 15%, HA 12%; central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 ): GEL 5%, HES 6%, HA 3%. Significant intergroup differences at 120 minutes: MAP: HES-LR; CVP: HES-LR, HA-LR; CI: GEL-LR, HES-LR, HA-LR; GEDVI: GEL-LR, HES-LR, HA-LR, HES-GEL; SVV: HES-LR, HA-LR; DO 2 I: GEL-LR, HES-LR, HA-LR; ScvO 2 : GEL-LR, HES-LR, HA-LR.


Influence of prone positioning on measurement of extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability indexes by transpulmonary thermodilution SG Sakka, U Bruecken, U Gloeckner, F Wappler Medical Center Cologne-Merheim, Cologne, Germany Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P224 (doi: 10.1186/cc7388)IntroductionThe transpulmonary thermodilution technique enables measurement of the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), which has been described in experimental and clinical studies to be accurate when compared with the reference method (that is, transpulmonary double indicator technique)[1,2]. In this study, the influence of prone positioning on the reliability of the measurement of the EVLWI and the pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI)as a measure of capillary function -by transpulmonary thermodilution was assessed. Methods We prospectively studied 12 consecutive critically ill patients (eight male, four female, age 20 to 64 years) receiving mechanical ventilation, who for clinical indication due to severe chest trauma or acute respiratory distress syndrome underwent modified prone positioning and extended hemodynamic monitoring by the transpulmonary thermodilution technique (PiCCO ® ; Pulsion Medical Systems AG). In all patients, an arterial thermistor catheter (A. femoralis) was placed and connected to a monitor (PiCCO ® plus, version 7.0 nonUS). Measurements of cardiac output, intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV), EVLWI and PVPI (five central venous bolus injections, 15 ml NaCl, <8°C) were performed 10 minutes before and after turning the patients into a modified prone position (135°) from a supine position. No changes in respirator settings and fluid status were made. The statistical analysis was performed by linear regression and according to Bland-Altman.ResultsThe range for the EVLWI was 5.0 to 21.0 and 5.0 to 22.7 ml/kg at the two time points. Linear regression analysis revealed r = 0.95 (mean bias 0.5 ml/kg, one standard deviation 1.4 ml/kg

We recruited healthy adult patients (n = 8) scheduled for selective upper limb surgery under axillary sympathetic blocks. StO 2 was continuously monitored over the thenar of the blocked arm using an InSpectra Model 325 probe (Hutchinson Technology Inc., Hutchinson, MN, USA) from the beginning of the local anesthetic (T0) injection until 30 minutes was elapsed (T30). The contralateral arm was used as a control. Differences between group means were tested by Wilcoxon signed test. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results StO 2 values in the blocked arm were significantly higher in all patients after the anaesthesia (Figure 1). T30 versus T0, 94 ± 2 versus 82 ± 3; P = 0.002.

1/kg/day lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on 5 consecutive days in five healthy male volunteers. Renal function was monitored and urinary proteome research was performed before and after LPS administrations on days 1 and 5. Results Repeated LPS administrations induced an increase in serum creatinine of 11 ± 3% (P = 0.002) and a diminished glomerular filtration rate of 33 ± 7% (P = 0.02) on day 3, which was associated with the appearance of 15 peak intensities and an increase in β 2 -microglobulin levels (P = 0.04) 6 hours after the first LPS administration. Four of the 15 peak intensities correlated with serum creatinine levels; namely, 3,950 (r = 0.91, r 2 = 0.84, P = 0.03), 4,445 (r = 0.97, r 2 = 0.94, P = 0.01), 6,723 (r = 0.94, r 2 = 0.88, P = 0.02) and 7,735 mass per charge (r = 0.87, r 2 = 0.75, P = 0.05). During day 5 of the repeated LPS administrations, endotoxin tolerance developed and renal function was restored, reflected by serum creatinine levels of 70 ± 6 μmol/l (P = 0.2, day 1 compared with day 5) and by attenuated peak intensities on the urinary proteome profiles (P <0.0001 for all measured 15 peak intensities) and β 2 -microglobulin levels comparable with baseline on the first day (P = 0.35). Conclusions Renal injury occurs on day 3 during repeated endotoxemia, as adequately predicted by urinary proteome research on day 1. A significant correlation was found between four markers and the extent of renal injury, which may act as potential new biomarkers for renal injury at an early stage of inflammation. The inflammation-induced renal injury subsided when LPS tolerance developed after 5 consecutive days of LPS administrations.P252 Urinary glutathione S-transferase as an early marker for acute kidney injury in patients admitted to intensive care with sepsis C Walshe, F Odejayi, S Ng, B Marsh Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P252 (doi: 10.1186/cc7416)

Little attention has been paid to the potential adverse effects of CRRT related to extracorporeal circuit bioincompatibility. Limited available evidence suggests that intermittent dialysis may compromise hepatosplanchnic perfusion in acute renal failure patients. By contrast, there are no data on the bio(in)compatibility indices in patients treated by CRRT. To investigate this issue, we utilized a long-term porcine model allowing a broad insight into organ hemodynamic, microvascular, metabolic and other pathways not accessible in human medicine.

Elevation of the head of the bed to >30° (semirecumbent position) is a recommended strategy to reduce gastric reflux, and subsequent aspiration of colonized gastric contents. However, the efficacy of this strategy to prevent VAP remains controversial. We studied the relationship between gravity and VAP in a swine model, an omnivore with gastrointestinal physiology similar to humans. Methods Twenty-six female Yucatan minipigs were randomized into four groups: (A) eight pigs were mechanically ventilated with an orientation of the trachea approximately 45° above horizontal for 72 hours. In the remaining three groups (B to D) the head of the bed was oriented 10° below horizontal (Trendelenburg position): (B) six pigs were mechanically ventilated for 72 hours; (C) six pigs were mechanically ventilated for 72 hours with enteral feeding; and (D) six pigs were mechanically ventilated for 168 hours with enteral feeding. At the end of the study period, pigs were electively sacrificed and quantitative lung microbiological cultures performed.ResultsAll eight pigs kept in a semirecumbent position developed pneumonia and respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 = 132 ± 139 mmHg vs. 479 ± 42 mmHg, P <0.0001) with a median of 5.5 lobes out of six colonized. Sixteen pigs kept in the semirecumbent position had sterile lungs and two pigs ventilated in the Trendelenburg position for 7 days developed a low level of colonization. Body orientation was the only significant predictor of lung colonization and pneumonia (P <0.001). Conclusions The semirecumbent position is uniformly associated with lung colonization and respiratory failure by 72 hours. In contrast. the positioning of the trachea and the endotracheal tube below the horizontal prevented the development of VAP.

Between January 2003 and December 2007 all consecutive BAL fluid samples from critically ill patients in the ICU of the Maastricht University Medical Center clinically suspected of VAP were included. Patients were divided into two groups: microbiologically confirmed VAP (VAP group), and microbiologically not confirmed VAP (non-VAP group). VAP was microbiologically confirmed if BAL fluid cultures yielded ≥10 4 colony-forming units/ml and/or microscopic analysis revealed ≥2% intracellular organisms. The CC-10 concentration was measured with a commercially available ELISA, and retrospective analysis was performed. Areas under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for CC-10 concentrations. Results A total of 196 BAL fluid samples were included from 196 patients (123 men, 73 women). Seventy-nine out of 196 episodes of suspected VAP (40.3%) were microbiologically confirmed. The median CC-10 concentration in the VAP group was 3,019 ng/ml (range: 282 to 65,546) versus 2,504 ng/ml (range: 62 to 30,240) in the non-VAP group (P = 0.06), with an area under the curve of 0.586. In addition, CC-10 concentrations were not significantly different between the non-VAP group and the VAP group caused by a specific organism (for example, P. aeruginosa) (P = 0.386). Conclusions CC-10 concentration in BAL fluid is not a useful marker to differentiate between VAP and non-VAP.

Methods Between January 2005 and December 2007 all consecutive BALF samples from critically ill patients in the ICU of the Maastricht University Medical Center clinically suspected of hospital-acquired pneumonia were included. BALF work-up included: differential cell count, quantitative bacterial culture, PCR for relevant respiratory pathogens and additional stains and cultures guided by clinical suspicion. All samples were analysed retrospectively by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the nucleoprotein gene of hMPV. Results A total of 144 BALF samples were included from 121 patients in the ICU (75 men and 46 women). RNA of hMPV was detected in two out of 144 BALF samples (1.4%) of two patients.

Methods Twenty-eight ICUs in Belgium, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the UK contributed with nonrepeat isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3,241), Escherichia coli (n = 3,306), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,660). Only nonrepeat isolates taken on clinical indication were included. Two models were used for trend analysis: Model A: changes in susceptibility (S), intermediate (I) and resistance (R) using the EUCAST breakpoints [2] described by the logistic regression model p R = 1 / (1 + exp(-a Rb R x year)) and Model B: changes in MIC distribution 2logMIC = a M + b M x year. The parameters b R and b M describe the time dependence, and the hypotheses b R = 0 and b M = 0 can be tested. Year was used as the independent variable in both models.

Presently, the optimal dosing regimen for administration of vancomycin remains unknown. The aim of this open prospective randomized study was to compare clinical and microbiological efficacy of continuous infusion versus intermittent administration of vancomycin in critically ill patients. Methods Patients admitted to the interdisciplinary ICU suffering from infection indicated to vancomycin administration with predicted duration of treatment of at least 4 days were randomized to receive either a 15 mg/kg intravenous loading dose of vancomycin followed by a daily 15 mg/kg continuous infusion (continuous group) or intermittent administration of 15 mg/kg vancomycin intravenously every 12 hours (intermittent group). Antibiotic therapy was stopped at improvement of clinical state and laboratory signs of subsidence of infection. Failure of antimicrobial therapy was defined as persistence or progression of signs and symptoms of infection, development of new clinical findings consistent with active infection or death from infection. The age, APACHE II score, type of infection, length of ICU stay, length of mechanical ventilation, mortality, clinical and microbiological failure and length of vancomycin therapy and total dose of vancomycin were assessed.

Betalactam efficacy is determined by the duration of time that concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Some studies have found that the administration of betalactams by continuous infusion maintains constant concentrations above the MIC of susceptible organisms over the course of therapy; but limited data exist on the clinical efficacy of betalactams administered by continuous infusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of piperacillin/ tazobactam by continuous infusion (CI) administration or by intermittent infusion (II) for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Gram-negative bacilli. Methods A retrospective cohort study (1 June 2002 to 31 December 2007) of patients with VAP caused by Gram-negative bacilli who received initial empiric antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam. We analyzed two contemporary cohorts: one received piperacillin/tazobactam by CI (first received a loading dose of piperacillin/tazobactam 4/0.5 g over 30 minutes, and after 4/0.5 g infused over 360 minutes every 6 hours) and the other by II (4/0.5 g over 30 minutes every 6 hours). The administration of piperacillin/tazobactam by CI or II was prescribed according to the physician's discretion. Results Significant differences were not found between both groups of patients (37 with CI and 46 with II) in baseline data. Logistic regression analysis showed a higher probability of clinical cure of VAP by CI than by II (33/37 (89.2%) vs. 26/46 (56.5%); OR = 7.4; 95% CI = 1.96 to 37.42; P = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed a higher probability of clinical cure of VAP by CI than by II when the microorganism causative of VAP had a MIC of 8 μg/ml (8/9 (88.9%) vs. 6/15 (40.0%); OR = 10.8; 95% CI = 1.01 to 588.24; P = 0.049) and a MIC of 16 μg/ml (7/8 (87.5%) vs. 1/6 (16.7%); OR = 22.9; 95% CI = 1.19 to 1,880.78; P = 0.03); but not when it had a MIC of 4 μg/ml (18/20 (90.0%) vs. 19/25 (76.0%); OR = 2.8; 95% CI = 0.42 to 31.67; P = 0.41). Conclusions Administration of piperacillin/tazobactam by continuous infusion may have more clinical efficacy than administration by intermittent infusion for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia.IntroductionThe guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not recommend the use of an antimicrobial or

## Figure 1 (
1abstract P313)Introduction  The usefulness of microbiological surveillance in ICU patients is under debate[1,2]. It can signal infection/colonization sites, most frequent germs and their antibiotic susceptibility. Our study aimed to investigate changes in the microorganism rate and their antibiotic susceptibility in ICU patients along with efforts to change antibiotic practice and infection control policies in the ICU. Methods A prospective study was performed in a 19-bed mixed ICU in an emergency university hospital. Blood, catheters, respiratory secretions, surgical wound secretions and urine were cultured any time in the case of infection suspicion or every 4 to 5 days in the case of patients with ICU length of stay >5 days. Cultures were counted no matter the infection or colonization status. Antibiotic use was recorded as daily drug doses/100 beds (DDDs). The study included two time periods: January to June 2007 (P1 -839 admitted patients) and January to June 2008 (P2 -779 admitted patients). Comparison between the two periods included overall and site-specific rates of positive cultures, patterns of germs, antibiotic susceptibility and antibiotic usage. Results The overall number of positive cultures decreased by 31.8% (P <0.01) and per patient by 15% (P <0.01) in P2 versus P1. Germ patterns changed little over time, most frequently found being Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter spp, coagulasenegative staphylococci and Pseudomonas spp. According to the site, coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from the bloodstream decreased from 42% to 26% (P = 0.01), but Acinetobacter spp. in the respiratory tract increased from 34.5% to 43%, concurrently with a reduction in Klebsiella spp from 12.7% to 3%. Antibiotic use decreased by one-half in P2 versus P1 (68.7 DDDs vs. 113.8 DDDs, P = 0.01). Ciprofloxacin dropped from first (P1) to seventh (P2) position (75% decrease) and resulted in a decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance of S. aureus from 94% to 46% (P <0.01).ConclusionsChanges in infection control policies and antibiotic use resulted in a decreased number of positive cultures in ICU patients and a decline in antibiotic resistance in some strains.

Pretest and post-test plasma cortisol levels were inversely associated with maximum norepinephrine dose in the same time periods (ρ = -0.22, P = 0.02; ρ = -0.18, P = 0.05; ρ = -0.21, P = 0.02; and ρ = -0.22, P = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions RAI and lower cortisol levels in CPB patients induce postoperative vasopressor dependency. Use of etomidate in these patients is a modifiable risk factor for the development of RAI that should be avoided.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has been demonstrated to play an important role in organ dysfunction and outcome of sepsis[1][2][3]. However, genetic predisposition of MMP-9 to sepsis remained unknown. Methods Seven common SNPs within the functional regions of MMP-9 gene (rs17576, rs2274756, rs2250889, rs9509, rs3918240, rs3918241 and rs3918242) were investigated in 192 patients with severe sepsis and 262 healthy controls. Meanwhile, the plasma levels of MMP-9 were measured via ELISA.ResultsThe genotype distributions and allelic frequencies of the above seven SNPs were not significantly different between patients with severe sepsis and controls, as well as between surviving and nonsurviving patients with severe sepsis (all P >0.05). Haplotype GGCTTTC, AGGTCTC, GGCCTTC, GACTTAT and AGCCCTC are the five most common haplotypes. The distribution of the haplotypes was also comparable among the defined groups. The median plasma levels of MMP-9 was 37.66 ng/ml in 32 patients within the first 24 hours following the diagnosis of severe sepsis, and 30.15 ng/ml in 19 healthy controls. Compared with those in surviving patients with severe sepsis (median 37.66 ng/ml, n = 16) and healthy controls, the concentrations of MMP-9 appeared an increasing trend in nonsurviving patients with severe sepsis (median 36.06 ng/ml, n = 16). Conclusions The present findings suggest that common polymorphisms within the function regions of MMP-9 gene may not play a major role in the predisposition to severe sepsis in the Chinese Han cohort. The plasma levels of MMP-9 may associate with the outcome of severe sepsis. Further studies in large samples need to be guaranteed.Introduction IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic effect in immunoregulation and inflammation.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2003, 100:1274-1279.Introduction Activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via vagus nerve stimulation or a7nAChR agonists improves outcome in animal models of endotoxemia, sepsis and experimental arthritis. This vagal anti-inflammatory pathway is mediated by the nicotinergic a7nACh receptor that can be selectively stimulated by GTS-21. Up to now, the anti-inflammatory effects of oral administration of GTS-21 in humans in vivo have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the antiinflammatory effects of oral administration of GTS-21 on the inflammatory response in the human endotoxemia model. Methods We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study in 12 healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers (18 to 28 years) during experimental endotoxemia. Subjects received 150 mg GTS-21 or placebo orally three times daily 3 days before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and on the day of the experiment, the last dose 1 hour before LPS administration (t = -1). One hour after the last dose of GTS-21 or placebo, LPS derived from Escherichia coli O:113 was injected (2 ng/kg intravenously).ResultsThe main study endpoint was the concentration of circulating cytokines after LPS in the absence and presence of GTS-21. The effects of GTS-21 on TNFα and IL-10 release are shown inFigures 1 and 2. There was a trend towards a decrease in TNFα levels and an increase in IL-10 levels after GTS-21 administration. A similar trend was observed in levels of other proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. abstract P359)

Conclusions No randomised controlled clinical trial supports the use of MIH in noncoronary OHCA. Although noncoronary OHCA seems to influence outcome negatively, further studies are warranted to examine the potential benefit of MIH in this category of patients. References 1. Bernard SA, Gray TW, Buist MD, Jones BM, Silvester W, Gutteridge G, et al.: Treatment of comatose survivors of outof-hospital cardiac arrest with induced hypothermia.Methods We retrospectively studied 172 coronary and 32 
noncoronary OHCA survivors that were treated with MIH in our 
ICU from 2002 to 2008 with regard to cerebral performance 
category (CPC) at hospital discharge. Bad outcome was defined 
as severe disability (CPC3), vegetative state (CPC4) and death 
(CPC5). 
Results Bad outcome was significantly more frequent in patients 
with noncoronary cause of OHCA (chi-square P <0.0001). The 
subgroups of noncoronary cardiac arrest differed substantially with 
regard to outcome. The outcome after coronary and noncoronary 
OHCA treated with MIH is displayed in Figure 1.

All adult patients admitted to critical care following outof-hospital cardiac arrest with Glasgow coma scale <9 after ROSC were included. The initial audit included nine patients Conclusions We have shown an improvement in the speed of cooling and target temperature maintenance. Our study also shows that the introduction of CritiCool correlated with an improvement in CPC. We suggest that more widespread use of noninvasive cooling devices may improve implementation of standards, avoid risks associated with invasive cooling devices and potentially improve neurological outcome.References 1.

cooled primarily with standard methods such as ice packs/cooling 
pads. Performance was re-audited between August 2007 and 
December 2007 following the introduction of CritiCool, and 
included nine patients. Data were collected using an audit form, a 
computerised ICU patient database (CIMS) and clinical notes. We 
assessed neurological outcome at ICU discharge by calculating 
the cerebral performance category (CPC). The CPC is scored on a 
scale (0 to 5) where higher scores indicate worse functional 
impairment. 
Results Following introduction of the CritiCool there was 
improvement in the speed of cooling to the target temperature 
range (patients effectively cooled within 4 hours: 33% vs. 57%). 
There was also improved ability to maintain patients within the 
target temperature range over the 24-hour period (57% vs. 70%). 
There was also a trend towards improvement in the mean CPC 
score at ICU discharge from 3.4 to 2.3.

Therapeutic hypothermia for postcardiac arrest patients: 
physicians are warming up to the idea 
Introduction Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) improves survival and 
neurologic recovery in resuscitated cardiac arrest patients. 
However, three published surveys with low response rates (<20%) 
reported most physicians have never used TH. We sought to 
evaluate current physician use, and barriers to use, of TH in 
Canada. 
Methods We developed a web-based questionnaire asking 
physicians to self-report their experience with TH using the 
Pathman framework of changing physician behavior. We surveyed 
all members of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians 
and the Canadian Critical Care Forum using the Dillman survey

Actual monitoring of severely injured patients misses short episodes. Computers could help to better detect such episodes by adequate algorithms. This method will lower the human performance usually observed in complex management protocols and could help to improve decision-making if implemented at the bedside.Reference 1.

Introduction Besides intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, brain 
tissue oxygenation (p bt O 2 ) monitoring with the Licox system 
(Integra Neuroscience, Germany) is on the verge of clinical routine 
in acute brain injury. Recently, a new p bt O 2 probe by a different 
manufacturer (Raumedic AG, Germany) was introduced into the 
market. As this new probe facilitates measurement of ICP as well, 
its use would reduce invasiveness of multimodal neuromonitoring. 
Therefore, we investigated the agreement of p bt O 2 values of both

probes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 
necessitating ICP and p bt O 2 monitoring. 
Methods Eight patients with p bt O 2 monitoring probes of both 
types implanted side by side in the same vascular territory were 
investigated. Multimodal monitoring data were stored online with 
dedicated software. Data were analyzed using the method 
proposed by Bland and Altman [1]. 
Results The mean measurement time per patient was 8.6 days. All 
data pooled, the mean bias was -0.66 mmHg. The precision range 
(two standard deviations of the bias) was -32.9 to 32.6 mmHg. 
The Licox probe showed a tendency for higher values at high 
p bt O 2 , while the Raumedic probe showed higher values at low 
p bt O 2 . Analysis of single patients revealed no discernible pattern in 
the relationship of measurement values of both probes. Three of 
the new probes ceased to function prematurely. 
Conclusions Our data suggest that measurements of both p bt O 2 
probes cannot be interchanged. No easy algorithm for conversion 
of measurement data from one system to the other is available. 
More rigorous bench testing is necessary before implementation of 
the new system in the clinical routine.

Conclusions CNS failure under septic encephalopathy is of organic character and relates to CNS cell necrosis that is not of focal character. The results obtained have suggested that the S100β level may be considered a marker of unfavorable outcome in patients with severe sepsis. Methods Thirty-six severe TBI patients (ages 16 to 69 years, GCS score 4 to 7) admitted to our neurosurgical critical care unit were evaluated. ICP (Camino), CPP, and SjO 2 (Abbott) were continuously monitored in the 36 patients, and PbrO 2 (LICOX) was continuously monitored in the last 10 patients. The treatment goal was aimed at keeping ICP <20 mmHg and CPP >60 mmHg. Patients with good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months after injury were regarded as having favorable outcomes, and those with severe disability, vegetative state, or death were regarded as having unfavorable outcomes. neurosurgery by Guglielmi detachable coils in the 1990s. The ablation overtook clipping as the initial method in many centers, including Brazil, because of the safety and feasibility of this method. The arteries of the previous segment were those that had a higher incidence of aneurysms. The majority of patients did not require hospitalization in the ICU. The mortality rate of cerebral vascular accident in patients with endovascular coiling was 11.3%. In this study we will present the time course of catecholamines and natriuretic polypeptides and fluid redistribution on pulse contour analysis calibrated by transpulmonary thermodilution PiCCO-plus monitoring after SAH.Methods Plasma catecholamines and natriuretic polypeptides of 54 consecutive patients were measured every other day during 2 weeks after SAH. The cardiopulmonary functions of 37 consecutive patients were monitored by PiCCO-plus daily during 2 weeks after SAH. Conclusions Persistent catecholamine release and the different sensitivity of blood vessels to catecholamine cause the blood volume redistribution: systemic hypovolemia and hydrostatic pulmonary edema. The excess cardiac preload due to catecholamine release leads to BNP release resulting in natriuresis.Reference

Introduction One of the most controversial areas of traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) critical care is the management of cerebral perfusion 
pressure (CPP). Since optimal CPP levels depend on whether 
cerebral autoregulation is preserved, these levels must be determined 
for individual cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of 
jugular venous saturation (SjO 2 ) and brain tissue oxygen tension 
(PbrO 2 ) monitoring in addition to CPP and intracranial pressure (ICP) 
monitoring in the acute management of patients with TBI. 
Results Thirteen patients had favorable outcomes. PbrO 2 values 
showed a positive correlation with CPP (r = 0.380, P <0.0001). 
SjO 2 tended to be abnormally high when the simultaneous PbrO 2 
values were <15 or >45 mmHg. High SjO 2 combined with low 
CPP or low PbrO 2 was associated with unfavorable outcome. The 
occurrence rate of CPP above 60 mmHg during the first 5 days of 
monitoring was 89.8% of the measurements in favorable outcome 
patients vs. 72.7% of those in unfavorable outcome patients 
(likelihood ratio = 1.2). These proportions were altered to 70.3% vs. 
46.8% (likelihood ratio = 1.5) when the simultaneous SjO 2 values 
were normal, and to 85.8% vs. 51.2% (likelihood ratio = 1.7) when 
the simultaneous PbrO 2 values were more than 20 mmHg. 
Conclusions The present data emphasize the clinical significance 
of brain oxygen monitoring in TBI and provide evidence for high 
SjO 2 caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. SjO 2 and PbrO 2 measure-
ments in combination with ICP and CPP should help in improving 
Introduction The purpose of the treatment of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH) is to prevent or reverse ischemic disabilities 
through hemodynamic therapy (4H therapy) [1]. We add some 
criteria to the index to assess patients with SAH. 
Methods Informed consent for each patient/family, APACHE II 
score, weekly Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, serum 
glucose, lactate, calcium, sodium and magnesium, measurement of 
axillary temperature and hourly diuresis as the additional prognostic 
index Sequential Organ Failure Assessment were obtained. The 
study enrolled 91 patients diagnosed with SAH, confirmed by CT 
in the ICU. The conduct to approach these new criteria was the 
same in all patients. These patients were divided into two groups 
according to their development in the ICU: Group I -patients who 
had satisfactory development (out of the ICU), and Group II -
patients who progressed to death. 
Results Among 91 patients, Group I had 55 patients (60.4%) and 
the 36 remaining patients (39.6%) were classified as a Group II. 
See Table 1. 
Conclusions Regarding the criteria used to assess patients with 
SAH, we concluded the only criteria that showed statistical signifi-
cance in the prediction of death was the serum sodium (P = 0.002).

Methods This cohort retrospective study analyses the clinical and 
epidemiological variables. It was conducted from a database of 
patients submitted for an ablation in the neurosurgery department 
of São José do Avaí Hospital (Itaperuna -RJ, Brazil) in the period 
December 2006 to May 2007. 
Results We studied 510 patients submitted for ablation: 406 
females (79.6%) and 104 males (20.4%). The average age of 
patients was 50.9 years (OR = 14). The total of patients studied 
that required hospitalization in the ICU was 176 (34.4%), staying 
on average 6.1 days (OR = 5.0). Hunt-Hess scale prevalence: 1 -
57.0%, 2 -27.2%, 3 -11.8%, 4 -3.5%, 5 -0.5%, and Fisher 
(tomography scale): 1 -41.8%, 2 -24.0%, 3 -23.5%, 4 -10.6%. 
We found risk factors involved in cerebral vascular accident. 
Conclusions We note the predominance of females for the occur-
rence of cerebral vascular aneurysmatic accident. The average age 
of patients was 50.9 years. Systemic hypertension and smoking 
showed a strong association with the presence of intracranial 
aneurysms. Introduction Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), non-
convulsive seizures (NCSZ) and periodic epileptiform discharges 
(PEDs) are common and associated with poor outcome after 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The objective of this study is to 
describe the frequency of renal, liver, thrombotic and metabolic 
dysfunction after SAH and their association with NCSE, NCSZ 
and PEDs. 
Methods We studied all patients with SAH who underwent cEEG 
monitoring from 1997 to 2004. Data assessed included admission 
creatinine, maximum values during the first 14 days for creatinine 
and total bilirubin, and minimum bicarbonate, base excess and 
platelets. Renal failure was defined either as a maximum creatinine 
>1.1 mg/dl or as an increase in creatinine >50% from baseline. 
Severity of renal dysfunction was assessed by the RIFLE criteria. 
The other continuous variables were dichotomized using the mean 
value as the cutoff point that defined liver dysfunction, metabolic 
acidosis and thrombocytopenia. Univariate logistic regression was 
conducted to identify associations between predictor variables 
with NCSE, NCSZ and PEDs. Significant (P <0.25) and clinically 
meaningful variables were then included in a multivariable logistic 
regression model to identify independent associations. 
Results A total of 116 patients were studied. The mean age was 
58 ± 16 years and 80 (69%) were female. Eighty-eight percent of 
the patients had a Hunt-Hess grade at admission of 3 or worse. 
Twelve patients (10%) developed NCSE, 17 (15%) NCSZ and 26 
(22%) PEDs. Acute renal failure (ARF) developed in 18 (15%) 
patients, liver dysfunction in 24 (21%), low bicarbonate in 37 
(32%), low base excess in 72 (62%) and thrombocytopenia in 55 
(47%). After adjusting for age, gender and Hunt-Hess grade, 
patients with severe metabolic acidosis were six times more likely 
to develop NCSZ as compared with those without acidosis (OR = 

5.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 27.8, P = 0.03). Similarly, after adjusting for 
age, gender and Hunt-Hess grade, patients with renal dysfunction 
were six times more likely to develop NCSE as compared with 
those without ARF (OR = 5.8, 95% CI = 1.5 to 21.8, P = 0.01). 
No association was found with PEDs. 
Conclusions Organ dysfunction is common after SAH. Metabolic 
acidosis and renal dysfunction were independently associated with 
the development of NCSZ and NCSE, respectively.

Introduction Volume management is crucial in intensive care; 
however, in some patients it is very hard to achieve optimal water 
balance. The subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patient is a repre-
sentative example [1-3]. Cardiopulmonary complications are 
common after SAH: neurogenic pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, 
and so on. Results Noradrenalin, dopamine and brain natriuretic polypeptide 
concentrations were significantly high during the entire study 
period. Intrathoracic blood volume was maintained in spite of 
systemic hypovolemia, and this fluid redistribution caused 
hydrostatic fluid retention in lung tissues on PiCCO-plus 
monitoring after SAH. See Figures 1 and 2.

the outcome of ICU patients. However, in an effort to improve neurologic outcomes of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), transfusions are still used frequently to maintain hemoglobin of 10 g/dl. We hypothesized that PRBC transfusion in patients with SAH would worsen their outcomes. Conclusions Use of PRBC transfusion in ICU patients with SAH does not improve neurologic outcome but increases risk of nosocomial infections. Hence, restricted use of PRBC may be justified in this segment of the ICU population, as well.Results Symptomatic vasospasms were noted in four patients. However, the symptoms were not severe and were transient in all patients. There were no patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. The clinical outcomes were good or excellent. There were almost no perioperative complications due to surgical procedures. AGF) are used to monitor and guide its treatment; however, no systematic approach to interpret their values exists yet. The aim of our study was to evaluate the correspondence between sonographic and angiographic findings and the efficacy of the endovascular treatment. Methods One hundred and one patients were admitted to our neurological ICU with SAH from June 2006 to September 2008. All of them were examined with daily TCD. Mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery >200 cm/s or an increase >50 cm/s/day or a mean flow velocity in the other arteries more than two times the normal values were interpreted as indicative of severe vasospasm. If a second TCD showed high blood velocities, an AGF was performed. If the vasospasm was confirmed, the patient was considered eligible for endovascular treatment. Ten patients developed severe vasospasm and were analyzed in this study.Methods We conducted a 19-month retrospective study of 84 
patients with nontraumatic SAH in an intensivist-run, high-volume, 
academic ICU. Patients who received at least 1 unit PRBC 
transfusion during their hospital stay (n = 42, median 3 units) were 
compared with those who did not (n = 42). Outcomes of interest 
were vasospasm (defined both clinically and by transcranial 
Doppler velocities), 28-day mortality, poor neurologic outcome 
(defined as modified Rankin score of ≥4), and occurrence of 
nosocomial infections (defined by National Healthcare Safety 
Network criteria). Associations of PRBC transfusions with these 
outcomes were measured using univariate and multivariate analysis 
that adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidities, neurologic 
status upon presentation, and procedures. 
Results Patients with and without PRBC transfusions were similar 
in age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidities, and neurologic status upon 
presentation. There was no difference in the incidence of 
vasospasm with transfusions (52% vs. 37%, P = 0.12) or mortality 
(12% vs. 17%, P = 0.53). PRBC transfusions were associated 
with nosocomial infections (69% vs. 33%, P = 0.001) and poor 
neurologic outcome (69 vs. 48%, P = 0.046) in univariate analysis. 
After adjustment for potential confounders, PRBC transfusion was 
an independent predictor of nosocomial infections (OR = 3.7, 
95% CI = 1.2 to 11.6, P = 0.03) but not poor neurologic outcome 
(OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.4 to 10.6, P = 0.45).

Introduction Various pieces of research have been done on 
prevention or treatment of symptomatic vasospasm and normal 
pressure hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage due to 
ruptured cerebral aneurysm. However, this important issue is still 
unresolved. In this preliminary report, we introduce our surgical 
strategy and techniques of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to 
ruptured cerebral aneurysm and discuss the prevention of 
symptomatic vasospasm and normal pressure hydrocephalus in the 
surgical aspect. 
Methods The subjects consisted of 19 consecutive patients with 
subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm 
who were surgically treated in acute stage between 2006 and 
2007. All aneurysms were located at the anterior circulation. Hunt 
& Kosnik classifications were 1 to 3, WFNS were 1 or 2, and the 
Fisher group was 2 or 3. We performed neck clipping of the 
aneurysm through the lateral supraorbital or pterional approach. 
We opened surrounded cisterns of the Circle of Willis and 
removed the hematoma as much as we could. The lamina 
terminalis was routinely opened during the operation. We did not 
insert any drainage tube postoperatively. 

Conclusions The surgical techniques with certain contributions 
might prevent symptomatic vasospasm and normal pressure 
hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured 
cerebral aneurysm. An accumulation of cases is necessary. 
Introduction Vasospasm occurs in up to 70% of subarachnoid 
hemorrhages (SAHs). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral 
angiography (Results All patients presented poor clinical condition at admission 
(Hunt Hess 4 ± 0.9, Fisher grade 3.7 ± 0.4). Sixty percent 
developed intracranial hypertension and 30% needed barbiturate 
coma and decompressive craniectomy. Severe vasospasm occur-
red 9 days after SAH (8.5 ± 4.4). In 100% there was 
correspondence between sonographic and angiographic diagnosis 
of vasospasm. Eighteen endovascular treatments were performed 
(70% either intra-arterial nimodipine or transluminal balloon 
angioplasty, 30% intra-arterial nimodipine). Angiographical and 
clinical improvement was obtained in 80% of endovascular 
procedures, the sonographical efficacy in 75% of them. Nine 
patients developed recurrent vasospasm after the endovascular 
therapy. Each patient received 1.8 ± 1.03 treatments. Two patients 
with refractory vasospasm died in the neurological ICU for 
intracranial hypertension; the other eight patients had good 
recovery at discharge (Glasgow coma scale 12 ± 2.3). At the 
6-month follow-up all patients had a favorable Glasgow outcome 
score (3.9 ± 1.59). 
Conclusions Our study confirmed the excellent correlation 
between TCD and angiography in patients with middle cerebral 
artery flow velocity >200 cm/s. TCD can be considered a very 
useful bedside tool for early detection of vasospasm. The 
endovascular management of vasospasm appeared to be safe and 
effective. The efficacy of the association of pharmacological and 
mechanical approach in improving outcomes after SAH and in 
reducing the frequency of secondary neurologic deficits was 
demonstrated. 



Conclusions According to the outcome, we can conclude that Group 1 obtained greater protection on the vasospasm incidence and decrease of mortality in comparison with Group 2. The P value was not significant due to a still small number of patients.). 
Methods After institutional approval and informed consent, a 
prospective, randomized, nonblind study was carried out between 
February and November 2008. The main goal of the study was to 
achieve a Mg serum concentration from 2.5 to 3.5 mg/dl, using a 
solution of Mg 2% (saline solution 5% 400 ml + MgSO 4 10% 
100 ml/24 hours), during the first 14 days of aneurysm rupture. 
Admission criteria: patients diagnosed with SAH and ΔT <96 hours. 
Exclusion criteria: patients with SAH and ΔT >96 hours. 
Results In a previous study evaluation we analysed a total of 56 
patients with (n = 26 in Group 1 and n = 30 in Group 2) (Tables 1 
and 2). Main results: Group 1 -vasospasm frequency 26.9% (n = 7) 
and mortality 19.2% (n = 5) in 28 days; Group 2 -vasospasm 
frequency 46.7% (n = 14) and mortality 33.3% (n = 10) in 28 days.

ventilation was longer in the VAP patients. About 20% of VAP group patients were also diagnosed with sepsis. However, the duration of ICU stay was neither influenced by VAP nor by sepsis. Four patients who did not experience any VAP were diagnosed with stroke during their ICU stay. All-cause mortality was not longer in patients with VAP. Conclusions In this preliminary report of a prospective cohort trial, it appeared that VAP did not contribute to additional morbidity or mortality. The majority of VAP occurred late in the course of ventilation. This supports the theory that VAP occurs primarily due to the disease itself and that detailed and prolonged care is required for the management of aneurysmal SAH patients.After obtaining approval from the Human Studies 
Committee of the University of Louisville to retrospectively analyze 
the prospectively collected patient data, we reviewed the elec-
tronic records of our aneurismal SAH patients admitted between 
2004 and 2007. VAP was diagnosed and confirmed by the 
Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score supported with culture results 
on days 0 and 3. We analyzed host-specific and disease-specific 
and care-related risk factors. Categorical variables were compared 
with the chi-square test, and continuous data were analyzed with 
the unpaired t and Kruskal-Wallis tests. 
Results Within 86 aneurysmal SAH patients admitted to the ICU, 
45 patients needed to be ventilated for more than 48 hours (52%), 
and 16 of them developed VAP (19%). More than 80% of patients 
with SAH required either surgical or vascular procedure. The 
majority of VAP were late-onset pneumonias (88%). The duration 
of mechanical Introduction A retrospective assessment of the outcome of 
patients with poor-grade (World Federation of Neurosurgeons 
Grades 4 and 5) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) at a regional 
neurosurgical centre. Previous studies have shown aggressive 
treatment of patients with a poor clinical grade of SAH is 
warranted as grading can improve following resuscitation and 
drainage of cerebrospinal fluid [1,2]. Many units still withdraw 
treatment if these patients do not improve neurologically in the first 
48 to 72 hours [3]. 
Methods A retrospective analysis of the notes of 116 patients who 
were recorded as having a diagnosis of SAH was performed 
between October 2002 and January 2006. Patients were excluded 
if they were World Federation of Neurosurgeons Grade 1, 2 or 3, 
had a traumatic SAH or been incorrectly classified as having SAH. 
Results Of 116 patients identified with a diagnosis of SAH, 12 
patients were excluded as they had a traumatic SAH, one patient 
had a dissection, one patient a subdural haemorrhage and one 
patient a basal ganglia haematoma. Thirteen patients had a 
Glasgow coma score >12. Eighty-eight patients were correctly 

deemed as poor grade. All poor-grade patients were admitted to 
the intensive therapy unit. Of these 88 patients, 34 (38.6%) 
survived. Twenty-four (70%) of the survivors were discharged 
home, eight (24%) to a care home, and two (6%) remained in 
hospital. Seventeen (50%) had a Glasgow Outcome Score of 4 or 5. 
Conclusions Outcomes from poor-grade SAH at James Cook 
University Hospital compare favourably with published data. 



MV). An electromyogram was realized in all patients and found axonal demyelinization. We defined two groups: group 1 (group treated by IVIg: 0.4 g/kg/day during 5 days) and group 2 (group treated by PE: 4 PEs during 10 to 14 days). We collected demographic characteristics, clinical and therapeutic aspects and outcome. We evaluated the beginning of motility recuperation and MV weaning essentially. The quantitative variables are expressed as the average or median ± standard deviation, and the qualitative variables by percentage. The univariate analysis was based on the Pearson chi-square test or the Fisher test for the qualitative variables and the Student test for the quantitative ones. P <0.05 is considered significant. The statistical analysis was based on SPSS 11.0 for Windows.The GCS and FOUR showed a significant correlation 
(r = 0.807). The GCS verbal component was scored 1 in 146 
patients; among these, 131 were intubated. The FOUR total scores 
(corrected for age) showed superior outcome prediction at 3 months 
(OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70 to 0.98, P = 0.03) as compared with 
GCS total scores (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.70 to 1.03, P = 0.09). 
Conclusions The FOUR scale does not need a verbal response, 
thus allowing complete testing in intubated patients (in our sample 
90% of patients showing a GCS V1 score were intubated). Most 
importantly, the FOUR scale demonstrated a better discrimination 
between the good (recovery of independent living) and poor 
neurological status at 3 months as compared with the GCS.

to four cases/100,000. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) and 
plasma exchange (PE) are the main treatment in this disease. The 
purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of IVIg versus PE 
in the treatment of GBS in a medical ICU. 
Methods This is a prospective, monocentric, nonrandomized 
study, realized in the medical ICU of the Ibn Rochd university 
hospital of Casablanca, during 5 years (2002 to 2006). We 
included all patients with GBS who required mechanical ventilation

IvAm. Authors suggest monitoring liver enzymes from the start of IvAm treatment. Rapid elevation in liver enzyme levels indicates a hepatotoxic effect of IvAm. In these cases the immediate cessation of IvAm administration and start of intensive care is lifesaving.the cardiac care unit: retrospective study of 3 years

Introduction Amiodarone is the antiarrhythmic drug of choice in 
treatment of patients suffering from acute tachyarrhythmias and 
haemodynamic instability due to impaired cardiac function. The 
intravenous form of amiodarone hydrochloride (IvAm) has individual 
antiarrhythmic, rate-controlling efficacy, and the dosage is 
empirical. The main adverse effects are hypotension, severe 
bradycardia, asystole, acute heart failure, and impaired liver 
function. Acute liver failure (ALF) is a known but rare complication 
of IvAm that may be reversible by eliminating the infusion in most 
cases. The few papers in the literature suppose ALF may be 
caused by polysorbate 80, the vehicle of IvAm. Oral administration 
does not to have such an adverse effect, therefore IvAm can be 
changed to oral form in any cases. 
Methods Our aim was to investigate retrospectively the incidence 
of ALF and relation of IvAm and ALF in cardiac patients. The 
history, treatment sheets and laboratory parameters of 11,722 
patients treated in the Heart Center between 2005 and 2007 were 
analyzed. Patients were considered severe ALF patients if 
transaminase levels exceeded 80 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 
during their stay in our clinic. The cutoff point was determined to 
differentiate ALF patients from heart failure and myocardial infarct 
patients with elevated transaminase levels. 
Results According to the enzyme levels, 55 patients suffered from 
severe ALF during the 3 years; 26 of them had IvAm treatment. On 
the basis of treatment sheets, start and elimination of IvAm treatment, 
status of acute myocardial infarct and heart failure and transaminase 
kinetics, eight patients had ALF induced by IvAm. Indication for 
amiodarone was atrial fibrillation (n = 6) and ventricular tachycardia. 
Average multipliers of ULN were 379 ± 190 at aspartate 
aminotransferase, 191 ± 87 at alanine aminotransferase, 57 ± 22 at 
lactate dehydrogenase. The time from start of IvAm to detection of 
ALF was 17 ± 4.6 hours. One-quarter of these patients died in ALF. 
Liver enzymes decreased to 10 x ULN during 2.5 ± 0.6 days. 
Conclusions ALF is a rare but potentially life-threatening adverse 
effect of P176

The mean age of the 26 patients was 53 ± 14 years. SVA developed in 42.3% of the patients and atrial fibrillation (AF) in 19.2%. The mean cardiac frequency was 82 ± 10 pulses/minute in group 1 versus 92 ± 10 pulses/minute in group 2. The incidence of SVA was significantly higher in group 2 (30.4% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.047). However, the incidence of AF was similar in the two groups (group 1: 3.8% vs. group 2: 15.2%, P = 0.135). The peak for the occurrence of SVA was on postoperative day 2. Right pneumonectomy and intrapericardial resection were not associated with increased development of postoperative SVA. No serious adverse effects caused by celiprolol or magnesium were seen. Conclusions Terzi and colleagues[2]  demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of AF using Mg. In our study Mg has no role in the prophylaxis of SVA in lung surgery. Perioperative celiprolol can reduce the frequency of SVA without serious side effects. In fact, increased sympathetic activity is one of the predominant factors in the cause of this complication.References 1. Amar D: Perioperative atrial tachyarrhythmias.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of LDD in the early post-transplant period.Methods Fifty kidney transplant recipients admitted to the ICU in the early post-transplant period were allocated to two groups: A (n = 20) treated and B (n = 30) not treated with LDD. All patients underwent postoperative intensive monitoring, control of blood sample and kidney functioning at 0,6 and 12 hours in the ICU. Postoperative therapy was the same for all patients, except for LDD. The intravascular volume was kept effective by maintaining central venous pressure >5 mmHg and ScVO 2 >70%. We collected donors' and transplant kidney parameters (age, sex, death cause, ischaemia time), recipients' parameters (age, sex, weight, height, BMI, duration of dialysis, end stage renal disease, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), intraoperative parameters (metabolic, respiratory and hemodynamic), hemodynamic and kidney functioning parameters in the ICU (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, ScVO 2 , lactate, diuresis, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, fluid balance), and outcome parameters (ICU length of stay, postoperative complications, acute rejection at 28 days, mortality at 6 months). Results There were no significant difference in donors' and graft data, recipients' data, intraoperative data, hemodynamic and kidney functioning data and outcomes in both groups. The significant differences between the two groups of patients were: Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was higher in group B (A: 24.4 ± 12.9; B: 31.2 ± 9.4; P <0.05); heart rate was higher in group A at each observation time (at 6 hours A: 94.2 ± 17.03; B: 85.6 ± 12.2; at 12 hours A: 92.7 ± 15.5; B: 82.6 ± 15.2; P <0.05); ICU length of stay was shorter in group B (A: 28.9 ± 17.3; B: 20 ± 7.2; P <0.05). Conclusions LDD in kidney transplantation does not improve kidney function during the postoperative period, nor short-term and medium-term outcome, but it increases the heart rate and ICU length of stay.

We tested whether low-dose nitroglycerin (NTG) improves microcirculatory blood flow in patients admitted for acute heart failure. Methods In 20 acute heart failure patients, NTG was given as intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 33 μg/minute. Using sidestream dark field imaging, sublingual microvascular perfusion was evaluated before (T0, average of two baseline measurements) and 15 minutes after initiation of NTG (T1). In a subgroup of seven patients, NTG was stopped for 20 minutes, whereupon sidestream dark field measurements were repeated. Capillaries were defined as the microvessels with a diameter of <20 mm. The perfused capillary density (PCD) was determined as the parameter of tissue perfusion. Values are expressed as the median and interquartile range (P25; P75).ResultsThe median age of the subjects was 60 (52; 73) years and 65% were male. Patients were in a stable condition before starting NTG. NTG decreased the central venous pressureP178

Conclusions Whereas V2-antagonism reduced metabolic acidosis, V1-agonism stabilized hemodynamics more effectively compared with AVP. Because of the prolonged survival time, selective V1-agonism and V2-antagonism might be superior to AVP infusion in septic shock. Future studies are warranted to investigate the combination of these two therapeutic strategies.Reference 1.

Adjunct terlipressin effect on vital organ perfusion during advanced life support in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation A Truhlar, V Cerny, Z Turek, D Kodejskova, J Suchankova Charles University in Prague, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P184 (doi: 10.1186/cc7348)Introduction Drug administration is an integral part of advanced life support (ALS). The coronary perfusion pressure (CorPP) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) predicts the probability of return of spontaneous circulation, while the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) affects brain damage. Guidelines for cardiac arrest treatment recommend giving adrenaline (ADR) although there is no evidence showing long-term benefit from any medication. Vasopressin was probably the most effective alternative studied in both experimental and clinical trails. As vasopressin has never been available in Europe, we evaluated the effect of its synthetic analogue, terlipressin (TER), on vital organ perfusion in an animal model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) (Terlipressin in Cardiac Arrest (TERCA) study). The use of TER in VF has never been studied before. Methods A prospective, experimental study in 14 domestic pigs (30 to 35 kg) randomly assigned into two groups: A (ADR + TER; n = 7) and B (ADR + NaCl; n = 7). CorPP and CPP were calculated from right atrial, aortic and intracerebral pressures. VF was induced using an intracardiac pacing electrode. After 5 minutes of untreated arrest, chest compressions were started using the AutoPulse system (Zoll Circulation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine S75 simulating hands-only CPR. At a time of 15 minutes after onset of VF, ALS was started for the next 45 minutes. ADR 30 μg/kg and TER 30 μg/kg were administered intravenously 19 minutes after induction of VF in group A, while ADR and NaCl were given in group B. Equal doses of ADR were then repeated every 3 minutes in both groups. The design of the study reflected the real-life time intervals achieved in clinical trials. The primary endpoint was to compare CorPP and CPP between groups A and B. Data were analysed using SigmaStat. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Conclusions Our results suggest a significant increase of CorPP and CPP after early adjunct treatment of VF with TER added to standard doses of ADR during prolonged CPR in pigs.

The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of ACRI according to different access sites. Methods We performed a prospective observational study of all consecutive patients admitted to our 24-bed medical and surgical ICU of a 650-bed university hospital during 6 years (1 May 2000 to 30 April 2006). ACRI included catheter-related local infection and catheter-related bloodstream infection. Results A total of 1,085 arterial femoral catheters were inserted during 6,497 days, 2,088 radial during 12,007 days, 174 dorsalis pedis catheters during 1,050 days and 141 brachial during 852 days. We detected 33 cases of ACRI (11 with bacteremia and 22 with local infection) in femoral catheters, 12 cases of ACRI (three with bacteremia and nine with local infection) in radial catheters, zero in dorsalis pedis catheters, and zero in brachial catheters. The ACRI incidence per 1,000 arterial catheter days was significantly higher for femoral (5.08) than for radial (1.76) access (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 2.56 to 10.81; P ≤0.001), dorsalis pedis

Particles have been shown to induce thrombogenesis, deterioration of microcirculation and modulation of immunoresponse. We assessed the effect of inline filtration on the reduction of major complications in critically ill children (Clinical Trials.gov ID NCT 00209768). Methods In a randomised, prospective trial, paediatric patients admitted to the interdisciplinary pediatric ICU of a tertiary university hospital were assigned to either a control or an interventional group, the latter receiving inline filtration (infusion filter Pall ELD96LLCE/ NOE96E, Braun Intrapur Lipid/Intrapur Neonat Lipid) throughout infusion therapy. Prior to this study, the infusion regimen was optimised to prevent precipitation and incompatibilities of solutions and drugs. Primary objectives were a reduction in the incidence of sepsis, thrombosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or organ failure (liver, lung, kidney, circulation). Conclusions The occurrence of sepsis, SIRS, thrombosis or organ failure often complicates the course of disease in critically ill patients. Inline filtration is most effective reducing the incidence of SIRS. Additional analyses are expected to confirm the preliminary results as well as to further identify the influence of inline filtration on other complications.P188 Central venous catheter infection: incidence and risk factors G Lane, F Bell, M Bellamy University of Leeds, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P188 (doi: 10.1186/cc7352)IntroductionWe performed a retrospective analysis of central venous catheter (CVC) infection over a 12-month period in a tertiary referral teaching hospital general ICU to establish incidence of infection and clinical factors associated with CVC infection. Methods We reviewed data from all patients admitted to the ICU over a 12-month period. CVC tips from surviving patients were cultured. Patient demographic data, diagnoses and therapeutic interventions from our audit database were entered into a spreadsheet. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature and ventilatory data were collected from ICU charts. Haematological and biochemical variables were accessed from the hospital results server. Other potential risk factors entered included the use of steroids, chemotherapy, diabetes, renal replacement therapy, tracheostomy or arterial catheter. Data were anonymised, and nested logic arrays were used for processing and error checking. Risk factor analysis was performed by logistic regression against the presence of a positive CVC culture. Results Of 865 patients, 191 had no CVC. Data were inadequate in a further 109 patients. In the remaining 565 patients, 836 CVCs were inserted. The median patient age was 61 years (IQR 49 to 71 years) with 51.6% male. In total, 19.5% of CVCs were twolumen vascular access catheters for dialysis, and 80.5% were fourlumen CVCs for monitoring and drug infusion. A total of 637 central lines were inserted via the internal jugular route, 106 femoral and 71 subclavian. The mean number of CVCs per person was 1.47, median 1, range 1 to 15. One hundred and nineteen catheters (14.2%) became infected. The median duration of CVC was 4 days (IQR 2 to 8 days). Logistic regression correctly predicted CVC infection on 85.9% of occasions, with a specificity of 97.4%, but a relatively poor sensitivity of 18.6%. Independently predictive factors included subclavian placement (OR = 0.35), standard central line (v dialysis catheter, OR = 0.75); days of catheterisation (1.31), peak temperature (1.42) and peak C-reactive protein (1.002). Conclusions In this study, subclavian placement was associated with a threefold reduction in risk of infection. There was a 31% per day increase in infection, and this was likely to be associated with pyrexia and a raised C-reactive protein. Interestingly, disease factors such as diabetes, chemotherapy and steroids were unimportant. These data call into question the common practice of preferentially placing CVCs in the internal jugular vein.Introduction Previous studies have investigated the impact of different types of bloodstream infection (BSI) (primary, secondary, catheter-related) on the outcome of critically ill patients, including only the first BSI episode in the analysis[1][2][3]. Our study aimed at evaluating the impact of different BSI types on ICU mortality including the total number of each type of BSI in the analysis. Methods All patients admitted in the ICU during a 46-month period were prospectively followed. Data recorded included: demographics, medical history, admission category (medical, elective surgical, emergency surgical, trauma), APACHE II score at admission to the ICU, BSI episodes, isolated pathogens, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) implementation, blood product transfusions, ICU length of stay (LOS) and ICU outcome. BSIs were defined as primary (PBSI), secondary, catheter-related or mixed based on standard criteria. Data were analyzed with logistic regression, and the statistical significance level set at P <0.05. Results Four hundred and twenty-six consecutive patients (295 males, 131 females) were included in the analysis. Age (mean ± SD) was 52.5 ± 19.4 years, APACHE II score at admission to the ICU 18.3 ± 6.6. The BSI incidence density was 26.3 episodes per 1,000 patient-days. ICU LOS was 21.6 ± 20.6 days. ICU mortality rate was 17.8% (95% CI = 14.3 to 21.6). In univariable analysis, the APACHE II score, age, admission category, CRRT implementation, PBSI episodes, and packed red blood cell (pRBC) units transfused during the ICU LOS were significantly associated with ICU mortality. In multivariable analysis, age (OR = 1.2, P = 0.003), APACHE II score (OR = 1.1, P <0.001), infection at admission (OR = 2.9, P = 0.007), CRRT implementation (OR = 9.3, P <0.001), PBSI episodes (OR per episode = 2.7, P = 0.002) and pRBC transfusions (OR = 1.1, P = 0.003) were independently associated with ICU mortality. None of the other BSI types showed association with ICU mortality. Conclusions In our patient sample, PBSI episodes during the ICU LOS were independently associated with ICU mortality, each PBSI episode conferring a 2.7-fold probability of ICU death after adjustment for potential confounders. The other BSI types (secondary, catheter-related) showed no association with ICU mortality.References 1. Renaud B, Brun-Buisson C: Outcomes of primary and catheter-related bacteremia.

Am J Respir Crit Care 1999, 160:976-981.Introduction The objective of our study was to determine the utility of a multiple system intervention to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) in an ICU. Methods We carried out a prospective cohort study in a medical and surgical ICU. We determined the rate of CR-BSI per 1,000 catheter-days during the application of an evidence-based intervention used to decrease the CR-BSI in 2007 (March to December) compared with the rate during the same period in 2006 in which we just applied conventional measures of prevention. During the intervention period we applied five measures: giving educational sessions about how to insert and maintain central catheters, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, filling in a checklist during the insertion of the catheter, using the subclavian vein as the preferred site and avoiding the femoral site if possible, and removing unnecessary catheters. CR-BSI were defined as the recovery of the same organism (same species, same antibiotic susceptibility profile) from the catheter tip and blood cultures. Results During the control and intervention periods we registered 4,289 versus 4,174 patient-days and 3,572 versus 3,296 catheterdays, respectively. During the intervention period eight CR-BSI were diagnosed compared with 24 CR-BSI in the control period.The mean incidence rate of CR-BSI was 6.7/1,000 catheter-days in the control period and 2.4/1,000 catheter-days in the intervention period (RR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.1 to 0.7; P = 0.03). A nursing intervention during the filling of the checklist was required in 17.7% of the insertions. The ratio of use of the catheter was 81.5% during the control period and 80.6% in the intervention period without significant differences between periods. Conclusions The implementation of a multiple system intervention with an evidence-based measure significantly reduces the CR-BSI in our ICU.Introduction Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) accounts for 10% to 20% of hospital-acquired infections in the UK and is associated with both increased ICU stay and mortality.Results Interim analysis of 398 children (171 female, 227 male, 
mean age 72 months) revealed a heterogeneous background of 
underlying diagnoses and a Gaussian distribution to either the 
control group (208 patients) or inline filtration group (190 
patients). First analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in the 
incidence of SIRS for the interventional group (95% CI = 68 to 
112; P <0.035).

S78 length of stay was higher in impregnated CVCs (14.11 days) compared with standard CVCs (10.7 days). Excluding death in both groups, the length of stay of the catheter in group I was 10.86 days, compared with 15.43 days in group II. Adding all periods of catheterization for each group, group I had an amount of 578 days and group II had 762 days. The total duration of group II was 31.84% higher than group I. Regarding the reason for withdrawal of the CVC, the suspected infection predominated in 77.8% of the time in standard CVCs and 49.1% of the time in impregnated CVCs. The culture of the catheter's tip was positive on 10 occasions (18.5%) in standard CVCs, against eight occasions (15.1%) in the impregnated group. Most patients had Glasgow coma score <9. The average APACHE II score was 17.97 in patients of group I, compared with an average of 19.63 in group II patients. The predominant site of puncture in this study was the subclavian vein (56.48%), and the catheters remained a long time on this site when compared with others (jugular and femoral vein). But when we considered only group II (impregnated), the catheters located in the jugular vein remained longer. The impregnated catheter cost 40% more than the conventional. Conclusions The length of stay with the use of impregnated CVCs was higher (15.43 days) than the standard CVC (10.86 days). The rate of colonization was higher in the standard CVC. Patients who require a CVC for long periods have benefited with the use of impregnated CVCs, because they present a long use term, a lower rate of colonization, avoiding complications related to the procedure of successive punctures and related to the permanence of the catheters. In view of the clinical benefits already mentioned, the benefit reached from the use of antiseptic-impregnated catheters compensated the initial expensive cost of 40%.Introduction Prompt central venous catheter (CVC) removal is often recommended in candidemic patients[1,2]. To investigate further, we evaluated relationships between CVC status and 28day and 42-day survival post-treatment initiation, overall treatment success, and time to mycological eradication.P193

An evidence-based review. Clin Infect Dis 2002, 34:591-599.Introduction Protection of the catheter site by antimicrobial ointments is one of the most important factors in the prevention of infection[1,2]. Povidone iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate and octenidine hydrochloride are the most common used agents for dressing. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of povidone iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate and octenidine hydrochloride in preventing catheter-related infections.Methods The study was performed in an adult ICU. Fifty-seven patients who have arterial, central venous catheterization were eligible to be included in the study. Patients were randomized to receive 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (group I, n = 19), 10% povidone iodine (group II, n = 19) or octenidine hydrochlorodine (group II, n = 19) for cutaneous antisepsis. Results The clinical characteristics of the patients and the risk factors for infection were similar in the groups. There was a statistically significant difference between groups in catheterrelated sepsis and colonization (P <0.001). The documented catheter-related sepsis rate was 10.5% in the povidone iodine and octenidine hydrochlorodine groups. The catheter-related colonization rate was 26.3% in the povidone iodine group and 21.5% in the octenidine hydrochlorodine group. In the chlorhexidine group, there was no catheter-related sepsis or colonization. Conclusions Chlorhexidine is an effective disinfectant agent. The use of 4% chlorhexidine rather than 10% povidone iodine or octenidine hydrochlorodine for cutaneous disinfection before insertion of an intravascular device and for postinsertion site care can substantially reduce the incidence of catheter-related infection.

Introduction Central venous catheterisation is a core component of intensive care management. Despite advances in medicine, central venous catheters are associated with infection rates ranging between 2.5 and 70% [1,2]. There is, however, little isolated information regarding rates of central line sepsis in neurointensive patients. Microbiology results from the 3 months preceding this study identified six line-related infections. Following implementation of a new evidence-based medicine technique for central lines, this study set out to review central line sepsis in patients at Walton Neurological ITU. Methods Eighty-seven patients were identified by the study criteria as suitable for inclusion, of which information on 65 patients was obtained. Baseline demographical information was collected on patient sex, age, catheter insertion site and procedural compli-cations. Analysis was then carried out to review the rates of line sepsis in this neurologically compromised group of patients, along with identifying any obvious trends in central venous insertion. Results A total of 69.2% (n = 45) of the cohort of 65 patients had a central line in situ. ) had reported line infections, two of which were coagulase-negative staphylococcus grown from femoral lines while one patient was reported to have grown Candida albicans from their internal jugular central line site. Conclusions Despite best practice evidence favouring cervical lines, the study found that femoral line insertion was more appropriate in this subset of patients with unstable head injuries. In addition, this study highlighted a 50% reduction in central line sepsis in the 3 months following our central line insertion and maintenance policies. Furthermore, early resiting on day 3 in the case of femoral lines resulted in a reduction in contaminated central lines. References 1. Jones H: Focus on venous catheter related sepsis.

However, complications can happen in up to 4.2% of internal jugular punctures and it is contraindicated in the presence of coagulopathy. The external jugular access (EJA) is underused, has low complications rates and is successful in up to 90% of cases. So far, there has been no randomized, controlled trial comparing both accesses. The objective of this study was to determine the success and early complication rates of internal and external jugular vein access[1].Methods A prospective,randomized study, performed in two adult general ICUs. Inclusion criteria were all patients who need central venous catheterization with a visible external jugular vein and no contraindication for IJA. All included venous catheterizations were performed by the first-year and second-year critical care residents, supervised by a staff physician. Admission type, APACHE II score and outcomes were recorded. Results Sixty-nine patients were included. The mean APACHE II Conclusions External jugular venous access is a good alternative to internal venous catheterization and it is associated with minor and low complications rates. Our results show a lower but not significant probability of success with the EJA. Considering that the procedure was done by physicians not familiar with the technique, however, we did not find definite evidence to indicate that IJA is superior to EJA. Reference 1. Blitt CD, et al.: Cardiovascular catheterization via the external jugular vein. A technique employing the 'J' wire. JAMA 1974, 229:817-818.Introduction Totally implantable access ports (TIAPs) are extensively used for long-lasting intravenous access. They can be associated with early and late complications, which are related to an optimal site of insertion and tip positioning[1]. Despite fluoroscopic guidance being the gold standard, ultrasound can be a suitable and easier tool to guide venipuncture and catheter positioning, provided a postprocedural chest X-ray is taken to rule out tip malpositioning[2]. Our aim was to assess safety of this technique in terms of the best site of insertion, tip position and rate of complications.Methods A total of 360 TIAPs were implanted between December 2007 and September 2008 in a dedicated surgical room at the ICU of the University of Florence, Italy. Insertion was performed by trained intensivists, using an ultrasound-guided technique. A chest X-ray scan was performed after the procedure to rule out a catheter's tip malposition and pneumothorax. Early and late complications were noted and recorded. A Fisher test (P <0.05) was done to test for association between the site of insertion and either tip position or occurrence of complications. Results From a total of 360 TIAPs implanted, the rate of malposition was seven catheters (1.9%). The site of insertion that consented the best rate of correct placement was the right internal jugular vein (P <0.05). The incidence of complications was 17 out of 360 procedures (4.7%). Early complications included five arterial punctures and one pneumothorax, while late complications included four TIAP displacements, one pocket infection, three catheter-related infections and three thromboses. A correlation was found between occurrence of late complications and left insertion sites (P <0.05). Conclusions Ultrasound-guided venipuncture for TIAP implantation was safely conducted in the majority of patients. The right internal jugular vein was the best insertion site in terms of the best rate of correct catheter tip position and lower incidence of complications. References 1.

Introduction Ultrasound (US)-guided internal jugular vein catheterization has been recommended to increase the procedural success rate and to enhance patient safety. However, there are few data on the potential advantages of the use of US guidance for subclavian vein (SV) catheterization. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether US-guided catheterization of SV improves the procedural success rate of the traditional landmark method in ICU patients. Methods Ethics Committee approval and written informed consent from all patients or their next of kin were obtained. We prospectively and randomly evaluated an US-guided method in 35 patients undergoing SV catheterization (Group US) and compared the results with 35 patients in whom a landmark-guided technique was used (Group LM). All procedures were performed by the same physician, who was experienced in both techniques. The catheterization success rate at the first attempt, the overall catheterization success rate, the number of attempts, the time to catheterization, and catheterization-related mechanical complications were recorded. Bedside chest X-ray scans were used to evaluate the position of the catheter tip, pneumothorax, and hemothorax. Results The groups were similar in terms of physical characteristics, systemic disease, and risk factors for difficult SV catheterization. Catheterization success rate at the first attempt (Group LM 63% and Group US 63%, P = 1.00) and overall success rate (Group LM 94% and Group US 89%, P = 0.67) were similar in both groups. The number of attempts for SV catheterization were no different in the groups (Group LM 1.6 ± 1.0 attempts and Group US 1.7 ± 1.1 attempts, P = 0.61). Three patients in Group LM developed six mechanical complications while four patients in Group US had four such complications (P >0.05 for all). The time to catheterization was significantly longer in Group US than Group LM (Group LM 178 ± 128 s vs.Group US 230 ± 127 s, P = 0.008).Conclusions Compared with the landmark technique, real-time two-dimensional US did not increase the overall or first attempt success rate in subclavian vein catheterization in ICU patients. The time to catheterization was significantly longer with real-time twodimensional US guidance than with landmark guidance. SVV) <13%. Hemodynamic monitoring was performed using the Vigileo/FloTrac system (cardiac output (CO) and SVV). Recorded outcome variables were hospital length of stay, starting of enteral nutrition, bowel movement, blood transfusion, and perioperative complications. Results Data regarding significant differences are presented inTable 1. Hemodynamic monitoring showed a higher variability of CO and SVV in PFR1. Postoperative major complications were also higher in PFR1. Fistulas occurred in eight cases of PFR1 and in three and four cases in PFR2 and PFR3, respectively (P <0.05). Conclusions Our study in still ongoing; however, ad interim analysis suggests that a restricted or goal-targeted perioperative fluid administration seems to provide more stable hemodynamics and a reduction of major abdominal complications.P200 B-type natriuretic peptide, corrected flow time and central venous pressure as predictors of fluid responsiveness in septic shock D Sturgess 1 , R Pascoe 2 , G Scalia 2 , B Venkatesh 1 1 University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; 2 The Wesley Hospital, Brisbane, Australia Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P200 (doi: 10.1186/cc7364)IntroductionThe plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (BNP) appears not to predict fluid responsiveness in septic shock but no account has been made for the potential influence of cardiac rhythm[1]. Also, no comparison has been made between BNP and other clinical guides to fluid therapy, such as the Doppler aortic flow time corrected for heart rate (FTc) or central venous pressure (CVP). The aim of this preliminary study was to compare BNP, FTc and CVP as predictors of fluid responsiveness in septic shock patients without cardiac dysrhythmia. Methods A prospective study of 10 consecutive adult septic shock patients (in sinus rhythm; 60% mechanically ventilated) treated with intravenous fluid challenge (4% albumin 250 ml over 15 min) in an Australian tertiary ICU. Results presented as the mean ± SD. Results The APACHE II score was 21.8 ± 12.7. Haemodynamic assessment incorporating transcutaneous aortic Doppler (USCOM ® ) occurred before and 5 minutes after fluid challenge. Concurrent with the initial assessment, blood samples were collected for BNP assay (ADIVA Centaur ® ). Four patients demonstrated an increase in stroke volume ≥15% (responders). Three of the responders had an elevated baseline BNP (>144 pg/ml). The percentage change in stroke volume correlated with baseline FTc (r = -0.81; P = 0.004) but not with BNP (r = -0.3; P = 0.4) or CVP (r = -0.4; P = 0.2). Conclusions Our data confirm that neither BNP nor CVP appear to predict fluid responsiveness. Furthermore, elevated BNP should not be viewed as a contraindication to fluid challenge in septic shock, as it does not exclude favourable haemodynamic response. Transcutaneous FTc offers promise as a predictor of fluid responsiveness and should be evaluated further.Reference 1. Pirracchio R, et al.: Impaired plasma B-type natriuretic peptide clearance in human septic shock. Crit Care Med 2008, 36:2542-2546. Introduction Stroke volume variation (SVV) is a good and easily obtained predictor of fluid responsiveness that can be used to guide fluid therapy in mechanically ventilated patients. During major abdominal surgery in patients with compromised cardiovascular reserves, inappropriate fluid management may result in occult organ hypoperfusion or in fluid overload and increased postoperative morbidity. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of SVV-guided fluid optimization on organ functions and postoperative morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.Methods Patients undergoing elective intraabdominal vascular and nonvascular surgery were randomly assigned to a control group with routine intraoperative care and a SVV group with fluid management guided by SVV derived from the Vigileo/FloTrac system. The intervention target was to maintain the SVV index below 10% with colloid boluses of 3 ml/kg. Postoperative ICU care was the same for both groups. Demographic parameters, comorbidities, performed surgical procedures, mortality and ICU and hospital lengths of stay were assessed. Laboratory parameters of organ hypoperfusion in the perioperative period (pH, base excess, serum lactate) and number of infectious and organ complications on day 7 and day 30 after operation were evaluated. The Mann-Whitney, unpaired t test and chi-squared test were used accordingly; P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study was approved by the local hospital ethic committee. Conclusions Fluid optimization guided by SVV during major abdominal surgery decreases blood lactate at the end of operation and may be associated with a trend for a lower rate of postoperative organ complications.

## Table 1 (
1abstract P199)Methods  The study was an analysis of coma patients with acute renal failure while undergoing CVVHDF (Equasmart ® ; Hemodec, Italy). By means of NICCOMO ® the TFC, CI, CO, mean arterial pressure and SVRI were constantly recorded. Employing the Pearson method, the percentage variations in each of the parameters during the CVVHDF treatment were correlated to the amount of fluid removed (FR), normalized to body weight. Results Ten patients were studied (six men and four women); the age range was 53.1 ± 15.2 years. A total of 16.6 l of fluid was removed during CVVHDF (830 ml/day over 20 treatment days). The median FR per day was 1,837 ml and the median hourly FR rate was 252 ml. TFC diminished in all patients at the end of CVVHDF treatment (average reduction 14.8 ± 9/kΩ), while all other hemodynamic parameters showed both increases and decreases. We found that the percentage TFC changes were closely and inversely related with those of FR (r = -0.68, P <0.001); other hemodynamic parameters showed a moderate correlation with FR. The ICG device was helpful to promptly identify one patient who experienced hemodynamic instability and to prevent it. Conclusions TFC is a reliable and noninvasive method for evaluating the quantity of FR during CVVHDF. This parameter changed consistently with fluid subtraction and TFC measurements can guide the extent of FR. This compact ICG device provides safe and accurate readings and seems to be one of the best options for evaluation of basic hemodynamic parameters and TFC during hemodiafiltration.References 1.

Calibration of pulse contour continuous cardiac output analysisIntroduction  We evaluated the effect of the calibration interval on the reliability of pulse contour cardiac output (COpc) measurement[1]. Methods Eleven patients were investigated for over 10 hours using two COpc monitors simultaneously. One COpc (COpcCAL) monitor was calibrated hourly, while the other (COpcNOCAL) was calibrated once initially without any further calibration. COpcCAL was compared with COpcNOCAL. Results A total of 116 pairs of cardiac output measurement was obtained. After 3 hours, the correlation between COpcCAL and COpcNOCAL was r 2 = 0.85, P <0.0001, bias ± SD was -0.43 ± 0.87 ml/minute; after 6 hours, r 2 = 0.68, P = 0.0064, bias ± SD was -0.83 ± 1.39 ml/minute; after 10 hours, r 2 = 0.70, P = 0.0026, bias ± SD was -0.81 ± 1.21 ml/minute. SeeFigures 1 and 2. Conclusions The calibration interval has no effect on the reliability of the COpc measurement.Reference 1.

Methods A prospective clinical trial was conducted in 20 septic patients 18 years of age and older who had invasive bloodpressure monitoring with an intraarterial cannula. PPV, SVV and 
POPV (%) were calculated and compared with the percentage 
cardiac index (CI) change. Patients with a CI increase induced by 
volume expansion >15% were classified as responders, and 
<15% as nonresponders. A parametric paired t test was used to 
compare hemodynamic parameters at baseline and after volume 
expansion. Student's t test was used to compare hemodynamic 
parameters in the responders and nonresponders groups. Receiver 
operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the 

predictive value of various indices on fluid responsiveness. 
P <0.05 was considered significant. 
Results We found a strong correlation existed for PPV for 
detection of a volume expansion-induced change in CI (r 2 = 
0.794), followed by SVV (r 2 = 0.667), and POPV (r 2 = 0.633). The 
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.96 
for PPV (P <0.001), 0.92 for SVV (P = 0.001), and 0.85 for POPV 
(P = 0.008). Respiratory variation in POPV exceeding 14% (sensi-
tivity of 72%, specificity of 90%), SVV exceeding 11% (sensitivity 
90%, specificity 92%), allowed detection of PPV exceeding 12% 
(sensitivity 84%, specificity 96%). 
Conclusions In the septic mechanically ventilated patients, PPV is 
the most effective dynamic parameter for predicting fluid 
responsiveness; all of PPV, SVV and POPV are well correlated 
with the percentage change of CI. Introduction Arterial pulse analysis estimates of cardiac output 
(CO) are less invasive than pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)-
derived ones. Although PAC bolus thermodilution CO (COtd) 
values are the reference CO values for most clinical studies, there 
is no defined gold standard. We therefore compared the co-
variance of three commercially available arterial pulse analysis 
devices (FloTrac, LiDCO, PiCCO) and PAC with COtd and 
continuous CO (CCO). 
Methods Seventeen postoperative cardiac surgery patients were 
studied for the first 4 hours post ICU admission. CO was 
measured simultaneously by FloTrac, LiDCO and PiCCO using the 
same arterial waveform. LiDCO and PiCCO were calibrated to the 
first COtd measured on ICU admission. Values of CO were 
compared before and after specific therapeutic interventions 
(volume, vasoactive or inotropic infusions). Absolute values for CO 
across all devices were compared by linear regression and 
Bland-Altman analysis. Dynamic changes for CO across all 
devices were compared by moment analysis. 
Results In 17 patients, 72 paired simultaneous CO measurements 
were collected. By linear regression analysis, all devices 


ConclusionsThe combination of noninvasive monitoring techniques with preload-induced SV modifications in healthy volunteers provides an excellent preclinical model for the study of fluid responsiveness. Although these hemodynamic monitors might provide different results, this model should be very suitable to assess the effect of SV variations on, for instance, parameters of peripheral perfusion.In addition the cardiac output changed significantly, but 
not during HUT when measured with the Finometer. Although both 
devices showed a similar response to the postural changes, the 
baseline values and magnitude of these responses were not 
identical. The mean arterial pressure remained constant during 
these manoeuvres. The heart rate significantly increased during 
HUT but not during PLR.

Introduction The PiCCO system enables hemodynamic evaluation 
and monitoring by two different approaches: the transpulmonary 
thermal dilution technique and pulse counter analysis. Optimal 
monitoring of cardiac preload is of paramount importance for the 
hemodynamic management of multiple-trauma patients with 
hemorrhagic shock. There have been only a few studies on the use 
of the PiCCO system (Pulsion, Germany) in multiple-trauma 
patients with hemorrhagic shock for hemodynamic monitoring. We 
hypothesized that performing a cardiac adequate preload 
evaluation with the PiCCO system would make it possible to 
predict latent hemorrhagic progress. 
Methods Data from 53 consecutive multiple-trauma patients (age 
51 ± 17.8 years, injury severity score 30 ± 12.9) with hemorrhagic 
shock at the scene of the injury or in the emergency room between 
June 2007 and November 2008 were analyzed. All patients 
underwent a hemodynamic evaluation with the PiCCO system. We 
divided the patients into two groups according to whether they 
received a massive transfusion (MT) (>2,000 ml packed red blood 
cell transfusion after admission within 24 hours) and compared 
their PiCCO data: cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resis-
tance (SVR), indexed global end-diastolic volume (GEDVi), and 
indexed extravascular lung water on admission to the ICU. The chi-
square test and paired t test were used to perform the statistical 
analysis. 

Results Twenty-seven patients required massive transfusion. 
Mortality was higher in the MT group (P = 0.05), and the CO, 
GEDVi and ITBVi values were significantly lower in the MT group 
(Table 1). 
Conclusions The parameters measured with the PiCCO system 
enabled evaluation of the correct cardiac preload in the multiple-
trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock. GEDVi was useful as a 
predictor of the need for MT.

ConclusionsThe volumetric parameter GEDV is dependent on age in haemodynamically healthy and spontaneously breathing patients. Indexing to body surface area does not remove age dependence. Targeting volume resuscitation using fixed ranges of the GEDVI acquired by transpulmonary thermodilution without reference to the patient's age seems not to be appropriate.1 showing a sensitivity of 67% 
and a specificity of 74% for a cutoff value of 9%; and for SPV, 
AUC = 0.74 with SD ± 0.12, P = 0.09 showing a sensitivity of 
67% and a specificity of 86% for a cutoff value of 8%. 
Conclusions A high percentage of patients were fluid responsive 
on arrival in the ICU following major surgery (40%). The PPV, SVV 
and SPV have a potential to predict fluid responsiveness in 
mechanically ventilated patients.

Introduction The echographic assessment of inferior vena cava 
(IVC) diameter (IVCD) variation allows for fluid-responsiveness 

prediction in ventilated septic patients [1,2]. Its applicability in 
surgical patients is not established, partly due to the difficulty to 
acquire a subxiphoidian (SX) view after abdominal surgery. The 
transhepatic (TH) view of the IVC could provide an interesting 
alternative. 
Methods In this prospective, randomized, crossover, pilot study, 
IVCD variation was assessed in consecutive mechanically 
ventilated (volume control) ICU patients, with SX and TH views, in 
random order by one operator. M-mode images were acquired at 
100 mm/s, 2 cm below the junction of the IVC with the right atrium. 
The minimal (Dmin) and maximal (Dmax) ICVD values were later 
measured on pooled images. IVCD variation [2], defined as dIVC = 
(Dmax -Dmin) / ((Dmax + Dmin) / 2), was compared between 
both views (when available): dIVCsx and dIVCth for subxiphoidian 
and transhepatic views, respectively. 
Results Twenty-eight patients were included, 19 medical and nine 
surgical. The TH view was obtained in all patients, the SX view in 
only 22 of them with failures in four surgical and two morbidly 
obese medical patients. Linear regression showed a strong corre-
lation between dIVCth and dIVCsx (n = 22, r 2 = 0.98, P <0.001). 
The agreement was satisfactory using Bland-Altman analysis 
(Figure 1): bias was 0.26%, limits of agreement were -8.4 to 
+7.9%. Results were similar for the IVC distensibility index [1]. 
Conclusions Our results suggest that the SX view, when 
unavailable, can be replaced by the TH view for the echographic 
assessment of IVCD variation. Further study is ongoing to formally 
establish its validity as a predictor of fluid responsiveness, 
especially in surgical ICU patients.

Introduction Estimation of cardiac preload is an important pre-
requisite for adequate volume resuscitation. The global end-
diastolic volume (GEDV) and the global end-diastolic volume index 
(GEDVI) are surrogate parameters for preload and have been 
hypothesized to be age dependent [1]. The current study was 
performed to assess the influence of age on the preload 
parameters GEDV and GEDVI prospectively.

Methods One hundred and one patients (41 male, 60 female) 
scheduled for brain tumour surgery were investigated using the 
PiCCOplus device (Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, 
Germany). On postoperative day 1, the cardiac output, GEDV and 
GEDVI were determined by transpulmonary thermodilution before 
discharge from the ICU. The influence of predefined age groups 
(21 to 40 years old, n = 12; 41 to 50 years old, n = 24; 51 to 
60 years old, n = 20; 61 to 70 years old, n = 26; 71 to 83 years 
old, n = 19) was tested using a Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of 
significance was 5%. 
Results Age significantly influenced the GEDV (P = 0.0024) as 
well as the GEDVI (P = 0.0007). Cardiac output (P = 0.3555), 
mean arterial pressure (P = 0.0764) and systemic vascular resis-
tance (P = 0.1446) were not dependent on age.

GEDVI lines, suggesting the effect of the Frank-Starling mechanism. Conclusions Our study has demonstrated that there are three mechanisms working at the same time in the relationship between GEDVI and CI. The basic mathematical coupling is modified by hydrodynamic rules and the final relationship is adjusted by physiological factors. The complex analysis revealed that CI and GEDVI are related parameters even in clinical situations.The ratio of patients with normalized baseline hypovolemia 
parameters at 120 minutes: CVP: LR 0%, GEL 27%, HES 47%, 
HA 20%; CI: LR 0%, GEL 50%, HES 64%, HA 50%; GEDVI: LR 
0%, GEL 25%, HES 68%, HA 44%; SVV: LR 3%, GEL 20%, HES 
11%, HA 25%. 
Conclusions In postoperative hypovolemic patients, 10 ml/kg LR 
solution has no demonstrable hemodynamic effect 120 minutes after 
the start of infusion. The colloid solutions have slightly different 
hemodynamic effects. Ten millilitres per kilogram of colloids can 
improve the hemodynamic parameters but their level is only 30% 
maximum comparing with the baseline at the end of the second hour.

Introduction Our goal was to analyse the relationship between the 
cardiac index (CI) and the global end-diastolic volume index 
(GEDVI), a volumetric preload parameter measured by the single 
transpulmonary indicator dilution technique, in a mixed population 
of intensive care patients. We hypothesized a close mathematical 
connection underlying observed clinical changes. 
Methods An observational study (OTKA T 046538) in the 
medical-surgical ICU of a teaching hospital. Hemodynamic data 
from 32 patients (altogether 122 datasets) were included in the 
analysis using the PiCCO system (Pulsion, Germany). The 
CI-GEDVI relationship was investigated using a regression 
analysis between the main components of the equation: GEDVI = 
CI x (MTt -DSt) (MTt = mean transit time, DSt = downslope time). 
To illustrate purely mathematical relationships, the theoretical 
correlation lines were calculated and compared with the measured 
data. To demonstrate the complex relationship among all three 
parameters a three-dimensional (3D) presentation was applied. 
Results The 3D presentation resulted in a good fit of the measured 
values onto the theoretical surface (r = 0.98). In GEDVI-CI and 
GEDVI-(MTt-DSt) there were aspects of the 3D surface where the 
correlation was weak (r = 0.35 and 0.34). However, classifying the 
data according to the ranges of the third parameter, a positive linear 
regression was observable in each range with high correlation 
coefficients. In the CI-(MTt-DSt) aspect of the 3D surface the 
regression was better (r = 0.76), supporting the role of hydro-
dynamic rules, and the correlation curve crossed the theoretical iso-
The 
physiological influences can modify this relationship significantly, 
however, especially in low ranges of CI. Evaluating the GEDVI we 
have to consider the CI values because the intravascular volume 
status depends on the relationship of these two parameters (high 
GEDVI with low CI -volume overload, the same GEDVI with high 
CI -normovolaemia).

of global end-diastolic volume index, extravascular lung water

estimation of these parameters using computed tomography

Introduction In critical illness, optimization of the fluid status is of 
central importance. This study aims to investigate whether 
radiographic estimation of the global end-diastolic volume index 
(GEDI), the extravascular lung water index (ELWI) and the central 
venous pressure (CVP) using computed tomography (CT) is able 
to contribute to an early, noninvasive evaluation of fluid status. 
Methods Thirty-two CT scans, 26 ICU patients. Estimation of 
GEDI, ELWI and CVP using CT. Transpulmonary thermodilution 
using the PiCCO within at most 6 hours (mean 2.25 hours) before 
or after CT. 
Results The diagnostic accuracy of CT-based estimation of the 
volume status (GEDI <680, 680 to 800, >800) was 25%. 
Sensitivity and specificity at diagnosis of hypovolemia were 0% 
and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) for 
hypovolemia was 0%. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 
74%. In prediction of a hypervolemia, radiographic estimation had 

a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 62% (PPV 36%, NPV 
96%). CT-estimated and PiCCO-assessed GEDI values were 
significantly different (P < 0.005; overestimation of CT-estimated 
GEDI in 91%). CT-based estimation of ELWI (<7 or >7 ml/kg) had 
a diagnostic accuracy of 72%. The sensitivity for the prediction of 
elevated ELWI was 92% (specificity only 13%, PPV 76%, NPV 
33%). The ELWI estimated using CT and the PiCCO-assessed 
ELWI were significantly different (P = 0.029; underestimation of 
CT-estimated GEDI in only 6%). In prediction of CVP (1 to 9 or 
>9 mmHg) the estimation using CT had an accuracy of only 53%. 
Sensitivity for prediction of hypervolemia was only 48% (sensitivity 
of 80%, PPV 93%, NPV 22%). 
Conclusions Estimation of hemodynamic parameters using CT is 
difficult. Estimation of the GEDI is not accurate, sensitive or 
specific for prediction of hypovolemia. At prediction of hyper-
volemia, radiographic estimation of the GEDI is suitable. At 
assessment of elevated ELWI, the radiologist overestimates ELWI 
values (high sensitivity 92%, poor specificity, accuracy 72%). At 
estimation of CVP, the radiographic estimation is not sufficiently 
accurate, sensitive or specific. Values for the GEDI and ELWI 
assessed using CT or PiCCO are significantly different. Diagnostic 
sensitivity/specificity of radiographic estimation probably can be 
improved by interdisciplinary training. 



Conclusions Bolus thermodilution and MostCare showed a good agreement at each time of the study. Although the IABP altered the arterial pressure wave profile this did not seem to affect the capability of the MostCare to adequately estimate the CO. This new device seemed to perform suitably in patients assisted with the IABP.). Furthermore, the PVPI ranged from 1.9 to 5.3 before 
and 1.7 to 5.8 after prone positioning. Correlation coefficient was 
r = 0.96 (mean bias 0.04, one standard deviation 0.35). The linear 
regression analysis with respect to the ITBV at the two time points 
showed r = 0.96, respectively. 
Conclusions Our results suggest that measurement of 
extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability 
indexes by the transpulmonary thermodilution technique is not 
influenced by prone positioning.

Introduction The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a device used to 
help the heart pump. During the IABP assistance, significant changes 
in arterial pressure waveform occur. The so-called pulse contour 
methods (PCMs) use proper algorithms to analyse the arterial 
pressure waveform and obtain the cardiac output (CO) [1]. As a 
consequence, changes in pressure waveform in patients on IABP 
may affect the reliability of different PCMs. The aim of this study was 
to investigated the reliability of a new PCM, the MostCare powered 
by the pressure recording analytical method (PRAM) (Vytech Health, 
Laboratoires Pharmaceutiques Vygon, Ecouen, France), by 
comparing its CO values (PRAM-CO) with those determined by 
bolus thermodilution (ThD-CO) during aortic counterpulsation. 
Methods Eight patients requiring hemodynamic support with an 
IABP after coronary surgery were studied. A thermodilution 
pulmonary artery catheter was inserted. To compute the CO from 
the analysis of the radial artery pressure waveform, the MostCare 
was connected via a cable to the monitoring system (Hewlett 
Packard, Andover, MA, USA). The comparisons of CO values by 
the two techniques were carried out at four different IABP settings: 
1:1, 1:2; 1:3, and 1:4. Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altman 
analysis were applied. Percentages of error were also calculated. 
Results A total of 64 ThD-CO and PRAM-CO measurements were 
evaluated. ThD-CO values ranged from 2.4 to 6.8 l/min; PRAM-CO 
values ranged from 2.6 to 6.2 l/min. Mean ThD-CO values ranged 
from 4.0 ± 0.8 to 4.3 ± 0.9 l/min. Mean PRAM-CO values ranged 
from 3.9 ± 0.7 to 4.2 ± 0.8 l/min. At each IABP setting: (1) 
correlations between the two methods were 0.90, 0.87, 0.88, and 
0.86; (2) mean biases were 0.11, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.12; and (3) 
percentages of errors were 19%, 20%, 19%, and 18%.

correlates closely with gravimetric measurements of lungs in 
experimental animal models, the correlation in human beings,

was to validate EVLW measured by the PiCCO system in the 
clinical setting.

Methods The present study examines the possibility of using an echo-state network for prediction of dialysis in the ICU. Therefore, diuresis values and creatinine levels of the first 3 days after ICU admission were collected from 830 patients admitted to the ICU between31 May 2003  and 17 November 2007. The outcome parameter was the performance by the echo-state network in predicting the need for dialysis between day 5 and day 10 of ICU admission. Patients with an ICU length of stay <10 days or patients that received dialysis in the first 5 days of ICU admission were excluded. Performance by the echo-state network was then level with the results obtained by the support vector machine and the naive Bayes algorithms. Conclusions This proof of concept study is the first to evaluate the performance of echo-state networks in predicting the need for dialysis in an ICU population. The AUCs of the echo-state networks were good and comparable with the performance of other classification algorithms.T Verplancke 1 , S Van Looy 2 , K Steurbaut 2 , D Benoit 1 ,

Introduction Echo-state networks are part of a group of reservoir 
computing methods and are basically a form of recurrent artificial 
neural networks. These methods can perform classification tasks 
on time-series data. The recurrent artificial neural network of an 
echo-state network has an echo-state characteristic. This echo 
state functions as a fading memory: samples that have been 
introduced into the network in a further past are faded away. The 
echo-state approach for the training of recurrent neural networks 
was first described by Jaeger [1]. In clinical medicine, until this 
moment, no original research articles have been published to 
examine the use of echo-state networks.

were 0.822, 0.818, and 0.817. There were no statistically

Introduction Despite several prophylactic approaches such as 
acetylcysteine, theophylline and sodium-bicarbonate, contrast-
induced nephropathy (CIN) remains a clinical problem. Regarding 
the large number of studies on CIN, little is known about long-term 
follow up of patients with CIN. The aim of our study was therefore 
to analyse the outcome of patients with CIN included in eight 

prospective studies on CIN conducted by our group, including 
more than 1,200 patients. 
Methods A systematic analysis of patients with CIN (defined as 
increase in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dl and/or ≥25% within 
48 hours after contrast-medium (CM)) using chart review and a 
telephone call to patients and to physicians involved in therapy 
after CIN up to 1 year or up to death of the patient. Composite 
primary endpoint: requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT), 
death, persistent increase in creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dl as compared 
with baseline value. Further endpoints: time course of creatinine up 
to 1 year after CM. 
Results Among 85 cases with CIN, complete datasets sufficient 
for analysis of the above-mentioned endpoints could be recorded 
in 55 patients. Thirty-nine male and 16 female patients; age 
85.5 ± 13.1 years; amount of CM 274 ± 181 ml; intravenous CM 
application in 12 patients, intraarterial CM in 43 patients. The 28-
day mortality was 8/55 (15%). At least four patients (7.3%) were 
treated with RRT. A total of 24/55 patients (44%) fulfilled the 
criteria of the composite endpoint (RRT or death or persistent 
increase in creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dl). Compared with baseline 
creatinine (1.8 ± 1.2 mg/dl), creatinine levels after 24 hours 
(2.3 ± 1.2 mg/dl; P <0.001), 48 hours (2.4 ± 1.4 mg/dl; P <0.001) 
and 1 week (2.5 M 1.9 mg/dl; P = 0.033) were significantly 
elevated. In 37 of the surviving patients, creatinine after 1 year was 
not significantly higher than before CM (1.65 ± 1.05 vs. 



ConclusionsIn septic patients admitted from the ward there is no association between the development of AKI and the timeliness of achievement of physiologic resuscitation goals. In view of the higher creatinine values measured at ICU admission in the patients that eventually suffer from AKI, it appears that the insult has occurred prior to the time of ICU consultation and that physiologic resuscitation does not reverse it. years with a male predominance of 67.6%. The median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score was 54. The majority (60.6%) was AKI III, with 22.9% in stage II and 16.9% in stage I. Overall hospital mortality was 39.4%. Patients who met septic AKI III had significantly higher mortality compared with AKI I and II (55.8% vs. 16.7% and 12.5%, respectively, P <0.001).M Mer 1 , L Ezekiel 1 , S Naicker 1 , G Richards 1 , J Levin 2

Introduction Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common problem in 
ICUs and is associated with a high mortality rate [1,2]. Early and 
aggressive management of renal dysfunction through intermittent 
or continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT) is now common 
practice. The objective of this study was to review the outcome of 
patients who received RRT in the multidisciplinary ICU of the 
Johannesburg Hospital, South Africa. 
Methods A review of ICU records between January 2003 and 
December 2004 of all patients requiring RRT in the ICU was 
performed. Demographic data, reason for ICU admission, presence 
of comorbidity, APACHE II score, the modality and duration of 
dialysis, as well as the outcome in the ICU were documented. This 
study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of 
the University of the Witwatersrand, and statistical analysis carried 
out in conjunction with the Biostatistics Unit of the Medical 
Research Council of South Africa using the Stata release 8.0 
statistical package. 
Results One hundred and fifty-six patients out of 2,200 admis-
sions (January 2003 to December 2004) were initiated on RRT. 
One hundred and three patients were treated with intermittent 
haemodialysis (IHD), 47 of whom died (45.6%). Twenty-three 
patients underwent continuous venovenous haemodialysis, 20 
(87%) of whom died. Twenty-two patients underwent both IHD 
and continuous venovenous haemodialysis, 15 (68.2%) of whom 
died. In eight patients there was no record of the mode of dialysis 
administered. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that the 
main factor associated with mortality was dialysis. Omitting the 
mode of dialysis, the presence of sepsis and the use of inotropes 
were independent risk factors associated with mortality. 
Conclusions Continuous RRT allows renal support in patients who 
would be unable to sustain IHD. The presence of sepsis and the 
use of inotropic support, rather than the mode of dialysis, are 
predictive of the outcome of ARF in the ICU. Of note, the overall 
mortality rate for ARF in this study appears to be lower than 
previously reported. Introduction Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock admitted 
to the emergency room appear to benefit from early goal-directed 
therapy, while this is unknown for patients admitted to the ICU from 
the ward. 
Methods We documented achievement of mean arterial pressure 
>65 mmHg, central venous pressure >8 mmHg and central 
venous oxygen saturation >70% within the first 12 hours after ICU 
consultation. Creatinine in the week prior to ICU admission, 
creatinine at ICU consultation and peak creatinine in the 2 weeks 
after ICU admission were recorded. 
Results Eighty-five patients were included, of which 40% achieved 
all goals within 6 hours (early achievement), whereas 33% did not 
but had all of them documented within the first 12 hours (no 
achievement), 27% had incomplete documentation of goals. Forty-
four out of 85 patients (52%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI) 
according to the RIFLE criteria. Patients with incomplete docu-
mentation, early or no achievement of goals were comparable at 
baseline, APACHE II and interventions except for more use of 
inotropes in the no achievement group. The course of creatinine in 
patients was similar, regardless of achievement of goals: baseline -
ICU consultation -peak, presented as median (IQR): early 
achievement group: 90 (61 to 119) -118 (86 to 204) -148 (86 
to 249); no achievement group: 76 (56 to 98) -121 (78 to 159) -
151 (88 to 205); incomplete documentation group: 81 (56 to 109) -
95 (65 to 175) -114 (77 to 223). The patients that developed AKI 
had a significant increase in creatinine from baseline to the time of 
ICU consultation: baseline -ICU consultation -peak, presented 
as median (IQR): no AKI: 75 (59 to 114) -87 (64 to 123) -92 
(72 to 129); AKI: 84 (61 to 105), P = 0.638 -145 (102 to 205), 
P <0.001 -196 (153 to 276), P <0.001. The development of AKI 
was independent of achievement of physiologic goals of 
resuscitation.

Introduction Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are 
entitled to the kidney transplantation approach at surgery with 
various modifications of the volemic status. According to some 
studies [1,2], acute tubular necrosis risk can be reduced by 
keeping a correct intravascular volume before graft reperfusion. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate goal-directed therapy in the 
early postoperative period in kidney transplantation. 
Methods We observed 50 kidney transplant recipients divided into 
two groups: 38 patients (Group A) underwent central oxygen 
venous saturation (ScVO 2 ) monitoring, and 12 patients (Group B) 
were controls. Continuous central venous pressure (CVP) and 
ScVO 2 were monitored the in ICU [3]. In Group A the volemic 
status by keeping CVP >5 mmHg and ScVO 2 >70% was 
optimized. We collected donors' and transplant patients' kidney 
parameters (age, sex, death cause, ischaemia time), recipients' 
parameters (age, sex, weight, height, BMI, duration of dialysis, 
ESRD, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), intraoperative 
parameters (metabolic, respiratory and hemodynamic), hemo-
dynamic and kidney functioning parameters in the ICU (heart rate, 
mean arterial pressure, CVP, ScVO 2 , lactate, diuresis, blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, fluid balance), and outcome parameters 
(ICU length of stay, acute rejection at 28 days, mortality at 
6 months). 
Results At each observation ScVO 2 was >70% in all patients of 
Group A. Diuresis was higher in Group A (at 6 hours, Group A: 
1,082.6 ± 1,000.7; Group B: 757.2 ± 462.7; at 12 hours, Group 
A: 1,020.5 ± 921.5; Group B: 835.4 ± 517.8). The heart rate at 0 
hours was higher in Group B (Group A: 85.2 ± 13.2; Group B: 
97.7 ± 27.7; P <0.05). Creatinine (at 0 hours, Group A: 6.9 ± 2; 
Group B: 8.2 ± 3; at 12 hours, Group A: 7.2 ± 2.5; Group B: 9.3 
± 0.07) and BUN (at 0 hours, Group A: 0.9 ± 0.4; Group B: 1.0 ± 
0.3; at 12 hours, Group A: 1 ± 0.4; Group B: 1.1 ± 0.3) were 
higher in Group B. The creatinine (Group A: -0.2 ± 1.2; Group B: 
0.4 ± 0.7) and BUN (Group A: 0.06 ± 0.1; Group B: 0.1 ± 0.04) 
reduction (12 to 0 hours) was higher in Group A. Diuretic 
stimulation was reduced in 10 patients of Group A and zero of 
Group B (P <0.05) and was interrupted in eight patients of Group 
A and two of Group B. 
Conclusions Postoperative intensive monitoring and optimization 
of intravascular volume by CVP and ScVO 2 grant fast recovery of 
kidney functioning in transplant recipients, so reducing diuretic 
stimulation, creatinine and BUN values. Introduction The aim of this study was to determine the clinical 
characteristics and outcomes of critically ill adults with septic 
acute kidney injury (AKI) stratified according to the AKI staging. 
The Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) definition for AKI had been 
shown to predict important clinical outcomes such as hospital 
mortality [1]. Sepsis is the most common cause of AKI resulting in 
worse clinical outcomes when compared with other causes [2]. 
Methods An observational study conducted in a medical ICU of a 
general hospital in Singapore over a 6-month period. Patients who 
were admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis and AKI (as 
defined by the AKIN criteria) were prospectively enrolled. The 
clinical characteristics and outcomes were determined and 
stratified according to the AKIN criteria. 
Results A total of 71 consecutive septic patients (60.6% Chinese, 
32.4% Malays, 2.8% Indians) were enrolled. The mean age was 
63.7

Introduction Acute renal failure (ARF) requiring renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) is uncommon in trauma patients. The aim of this 
study was to assess incidence and outcome in this patient group. 
Methods Adult trauma patients with ARF treated with RRT at 
Ullevaal University Hospital between 1 January 1996 and 31 
December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The hospital is the 

regional trauma referral centre for approximately 1.93 million adult 
(>18 years) persons. Individuals were identified and data were 
collected using several institutional registries in addition to the 
Norwegian renal registry. Patients were grouped according to 
presence of rhabdomyolysis based on peak serum creatine kinase 
levels exceeding 10,000 U/l or not. Categorical data were 
compared employing the two-sided Pearson chi-square test, 
whereas continuous data were compared utilizing the two-tailed 
Mann-Whitney U test. 
Results There were 78,345 hospital admissions due to trauma 
during the study period, 42 of these underwent RRT for ARF (after 
excluding one person due to low age, three with nonrenal 
indications for RRT and another three with chronic renal failure). 
The incidence rate of post-traumatic ARF requiring RRT was 
0.54‰, and was higher in males compared with females (33.72 
vs. 6.05 per million persons, P <0.01). The patients' age was 
median (range) 46.4 (18 to 84) years, and 85.7% were males. 
Mortality rates were 23.8% (ICU/hospital), 35.7% (3 months) and 
40.5% (1 year). Renal recovery, defined as independency from 
RRT, occurred in all survivors after 3 months and 1 year. 
Rhabdomyolysis was present in 18 persons (42.9%) and was only 
registered in males. Trauma patients with rhabdomyolysis were 
significantly younger (33.0 vs. 57.0 years, P = 0.01), needed RRT 
earlier (3.0 vs. 6.5 days, P = 0.02) and had lower 3-month (16.7 
vs. 50.0%, P = 0.03) and 1-year (22.2 vs. 54.2%, P = 0.04) 
mortality rates compared with nonrhabdomyolytic persons. 
Introduction There are limited data about the epidemiology of 
acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients in Northern Ireland. 
The aim of this study was to examine AKI within 24 hours of ICU 
admission and its relation to outcomes (ICU mortality and hospital 
mortality). 
Methods A secondary analysis of prospectively collected data in 
the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre Case Mix 
Programme Database. The Case Mix Programme Database was 
interrogated and data extracted from 22,313 admissions to eight 
ICUs from 1999 to 2007. The presence of AKI was assessed 
within the first 24 hours after admission (early AKI) and classified 
according to the RIFLE criteria. Trends over time were described 
for the RIFLE categories, and outcomes of admissions in each 
category were summarised. Where available, information on the 
use of renal replacement therapy during the ICU stay was 
analysed. 
Results Trends in early AKI changed little over time: 35.5% of 
patients sustained AKI (risk 13.5%, injury 11.1%, failure 9.8%, 
end-stage 1.2%) and 9% of patients received renal replacement 
therapy. Outcomes are presented in Table 1. 
total body surface area burn (TBSA%), severity of illness was 
estimated using the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score. The 
pRIFLE criteria were applied and the patients were assigned to the 
appropriate pRIFLE stratum (Risk, Injury, Failure) if they fulfilled 
either estimated creatinine clearance, urine output criteria, or both. 
Results The incidence of AKI was 40.7%, maximum RIFLE class 
Risk, class Injury and class Failure occurred in 50%, 36% and 
18%, respectively. Patients with maximum RIFLE class Risk, Injury 
and Failure had ICU mortality rates of 0%, 5.6% and 57.1%, 
respectively, compared with 1.4% for patients without AKI. We 
observed statistically significant differences between the patients 
with AKI and those without AKI in the following parameters: TBSA 
(41.2 ± 17.7% vs. 24.2 ± 14.6%, P <0.001), admission PRISM 
(8.6 ± 6.4 vs. 4.8 ± 3.4, P <0.01), number of surgical procedures 
(3.7 ± 2.9 vs. 1.5 ± 1.5, P <0.001), occurrence of abdominal 
compartment syndrome (18% vs. 0%, P <0.001), length of 
mechanical ventilation (22.3 ± 27.6 days vs. 7.1 ± 11.4 days, 
P <0.001) and length of ICU stay (37 ± 30.1 days vs. 14.6 ± 13.9 
days, P <0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that PRISM 
score (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.2; P = 0.05) and TBSA 
(OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.1; P <0.001) were independent 
risk factors for AKI in pediatric burn patients.

1All of the patients had their anticoagulant switched from heparin to bivalirudin, despite implanted circulation assisting devices and RRT. Coagulation system status was evaluated by the activated partial thromboplastin time, of which target value was twice the upper normal range. The bivalirudin infusion dose ranged from 50 μ/kg/hour to 100 μ/kg/hour, depending on the activated partial thromboplastin time value. Bivalirudin was found to be at least as safe and effective an anticoagulant as heparin. Conclusions HIT patients must be switched from heparin to alternative anticoagulant. Bivalirudin is a safe and effective anticoagulant for extracorporeal RRT; however, the dose should be adjusted individually. Bivalirudin has prolonged effect in ARF patients and does not have antagonists. CRRT circuits clot frequently in liver failure patients. Anticoagulation did improve CRRT circuit survival without an obvious increase in bleeding or blood transfusion requirement. Anticoagulation should therefore be considered in these patients in cases of repeated circuit clotting. Reference 1. Davenport A: CRRT in the management of patients with liver disease.

Introduction The aim was to study the practice pattern of using 
the modern modalities of renal replacement therapy (RRT) (slow 
low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) and continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT)) in hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients 
in an Indian ICU. 
Methods A retrospective observational study of hemodynamically 
unstable patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who needed RRT in 
ICUs of a tertiary-care hospital. All patients who underwent SLED 
and/or CRRT from September 2005 to April 2008 were taken up 
for analysis. To maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) 
>70 mmHg, Results From September 2005 to April 2008, 214 haemo-
dynamically unstable AKI patients, deemed unfit for intermittent 
haemodialysis, underwent SLED/CRRT (continuous venovenous 
hemofiltration (CVVH)/continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration 
(CVVHDF)). Ten patients were switched to SLED after a median 
48 hours of CRRT. See Figures 1 and 2. 
Conclusions In our ICU, the need for RRT in hemodynamically 
unstable patients with AKI was significantly higher in the medical 
patients, the commonest cause of AKI being sepsis. Patients who 

were equally sick (comparable APACHE II scores) could be 
effectively dialysed by SLED, as compared with CRRT. 



We aimed to review our patients to see how we compare. Methods We prospectively collected data on all RRT episodes on the ICU from 2005 to 2007: patient age, APACHE II score in the first 24 hours, primary indication for RRT, RIFLE classification at start of RRT, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality at 30, 60, and 90 days, and recovery of renal function at 30 days.C Hayes-Bradley, S Caddel, J Paddle

Introduction Previous studies have shown the mortality of ICU 
patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) to be high at 
62.8% [1], and underpredicted by APACHE II scoring [2]. The 
ICNARC Case Mix Programme gives mortality of 59.5% for 2003 
to 2004. Results We admitted 1,557 patients over the 3-year study period, 
of which 18% were elective. A total of 210 patients received RRT 
(data were available on 208). The median age was 66 years, 56% 
were male, and mean APACHE II score was 25.4. Our hospital 
mortality for all patients receiving RRT was 50.5%. One hundred 
and seventy-six patients had RRT for acute kidney injury with a 
hospital mortality of 51.1% (23 class Risk patients, 70 class Injury, 
83 class Failure). No statistical difference in hospital mortality, ICU 
LOS, or renal function recovery existed by RIFLE class. By 
APACHE II score, the standardised mortality ratio was 0.98 (1.1 in 
2005, 0.97 in 2006, and 0.86 in 2007). Main indications for 
filtration were: acidaemia 51%, oliguria 9%, uraemia 13%, fluid 
overload 7%, sepsis 6%, and hyperkalaemia <1%. The average 
ICU LOS was 9 days for hospital survivors (IQR 5 to 21 days) and 
4 days in nonsurvivors (IQR 2 to 8 days). Only three hospital 
survivors were not alive at 90 days. Three out of 82 followed-up 
patients still required dialysis at 30 days. 
Conclusions Our hospital mortality compares favourably with 
other published work

39-month period, following the introduction of our ventilation care 
bundle, which includes 30° head-up position, deep vein 
thrombosis and peptic ulcer prophylaxis, sedation holds and using 
chlorhexidine for mouth care. VAP is difficult to diagnose and 
definitions vary. Our diagnoses were made prospectively by a 
single consultant microbiologist using the validated Clinical 
Pulmonary Infection Score. After 18 months we introduced the Hi-
Lo Evac/Lanz Mallinckrodt endotracheal tubes with suction applied 
using a 10 ml syringe 2-hourly, as our study intervention. 
Results The benchmark for European ICUs is a rate of 5% to 15% 
(HELICS; Hospital In Europe Link for Infection Control through 
Surveillance) and in America is 3 to 20 cases per 1,000 ventilator-
days (NNIS; National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System). 
For the 18 months following the implementation of care bundles, 
our VAP rate was 5.39% (25/463 patients) with an incidence of 
14 cases per 1,000 ventilator-days. Following the study inter-
vention the VAP rate fell to 1.5% (8/530 patients) and the 
incidence to 4.17 cases per 1,000 ventilator-days. Our cohort of 
patients over the period had no difference in APACHE II scores. 
The difference between the groups following the employment of 
subglottic secretion reached statistical significance with relative 
risk 3.57 (95% CI = 1.63 to 7.85, P <0.001). 
Conclusions Our study confirms the benefit of subglottic 
secretion clearance to reduce the occurrence of VAP.

Conclusions The results of BACTEC and SeptiFast were the 
same in 12/16 (75%) patients. In 3/16 (18%) patients the 
SeptiFast test showed a positive result, not detected by BACTEC. 
In only 1/16 (6%) we found a positivity in BACTEC, and negativity 
in SeptiFast. This result was probably due to contamination of 
samples for BACTEC. SeptiFast is a valuable add-on to the 
traditional gold standard with cultivation methods, also during 
antimicrobial treatment. This study represents a limited assessment 
of the PCR's performance. To properly assess the clinical value of 
this technique, a prospective study with a larger population could 
be useful.

Of 1,487 admissions to our ICU, 181 (12.2%) resulted in the patient's death on the ICU and 110 (7.4%) ended with either the patient's discharge to another hospital or ICU and thus their loss to follow up. Eleven patients discharged for palliation were excluded from analysis. A total of 1,185 (79.7%) were discharged to a ward in the hospital and so could potentially have suffered an unexpected deterioration resulting in ICU readmission or death. Of these, 117 (9.9%) of the discharge episodes were followed by an unexpected poor outcome of either readmission (n = 83, 7.0%) or death (n = 34, 2.9%) within 2 weeks. A composite outcome measure combining these two poor outcomes was associated with age, higher APACHE II score, and a low plasma albumin on ICU discharge. Means and median values were compared using P <0.05 as the test of significance. Plasma CRP on discharge from the ICU was not associated with this composite measure. Conclusions In a mixed medical/surgical ICU, CRP on the day of discharge is not associated with a poor outcome measure of unexpected readmission or ward death.References 1.

Primary outcome: ICU length of stay (LOS); secondary outcomes: duration of mechanical ventilation, accidental removal of indwelling devices, ICU readmission rate, hospital LOS, 90-day mortality, and stressful events (interview at ICU exit and after 3 months). Results In four ICUs, three academic and one teaching hospital, a total number of 617 patients was randomized; 205 to the WC strategy, 202 to sedation guided by BIS, and 210 to the control group. The study groups were well balanced according to baseline characteristics. Neither ICU LOS (median (IQR) 11 P = 0.97) were different between groups. Accidental removal of indwelling devices was encountered 37 times (10 times in nine patients (WC), six times in five patients (BIS), and 21 times in 11 patients (control), P = 0.01). The ICU readmission rate, hospital LOS, and 90-day mortality were not different between groups. Interviews showed similar stress experiences.Conclusions Although a significant higher number of incidents with indwelling devices occurred in the control group, no additional differences between the three sedation regimens were revealed.Although current guidelines on ICU sedation have incorporated WC next to clinical sedation scales, the results from this larger study do not promote either WC or BIS in guiding sedation of ICU patients.

We describe a series of endoscopic studies, sedated by the Intensive Care Department. Different sedation protocols are described, emphasizing some patients sedated with ketamine plus midazolam, drugs rarely reported for adults. Methods Patients older than 18 years, whose performed endoscopic, colonoscopic or both procedures under sedation were performed by the Intensive Care Department of the Hospital del Tajo. Data were collected for 6 months. Demographic characteristics, medical history, American Society of Anesthesiology classification, drugs bolus and total dosages, respiratory and hemodynamic data, the length of procedure and recovery, and complications were collected. Tolerance was assessed by an endoscopist, with a 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good) scale. Different indices of two groups of treatment were compared, propofolfentanyl (Group A) versus ketamine-midazolam (Group B) using the chi-square test and the Student t test. Results In total, 245 procedures were included. 98%) and respiratory depression 12 (4.9%). Length of procedure was 31.20 minutes (SD = 15.53) and recovery time was 64.86 minutes (SD = 37.56). Comparing Group A versus Group B, hypotension (12.67% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.023) and respiratory depression (6.67% vs. 0%, P = 0.03) were more frequent with Group A. Group B presented a higher percentage of vomiting (0% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.009) and hallucinations (0% vs. 11.59%, P < 0.001). The length of recovery was longer for Group B (61.12 min vs. 78.98 min, P = 0.008). Conclusions Sedation for endoscopic procedures performed by intensivists is safe and well tolerated for most patients, with a similar percentage of complications compared with previous reports. Ketamine plus midazolam are safe and could be useful for short-length sedation in patients with a high risk of respiratory depression.(6 to 21)

Novel responsiveness index measures the level of sedation in cardiac ICU patientsIntroduction Sedation is an integral part of the management of patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. At present, sedation is usually managed by clinical assessments, often in conjunction with a protocol for adjusting drug doses. This approach has been shown to decrease ventilation times and is considered the best practice in recent guidelines[1]. Such scales, however, provide only intermittent and, to some extent, subjective information about the patient's state. Also, not every scale used in clinical practice is validated for ICU use and interobserver variation may occur. Methods We have developed a novel method that analyzes the patterns in the electromyographic (EMG) component of the frontal biopotential signal that are associated with activation and arousal processes. By quantifying the amount and magnitude of the response patterns in the past 60 minutes, a responsiveness index (RI) ranging between 0 and 100 (0 corresponds to a nonresponsive patient and 100 to a high amount of responses) is derived. Previously, we have compared the RI with EEG spectral entropy[2]  in general ICU patients. Now we have studied the performance of the RI with 17 cardiac ICU patients and compared these with the development dataset analyzed by Viertiö-Oja and colleagues[2]. A subgroup of 17 patients (of total 30 patients) with a clinically assessed low probability of encephalopathy was used as the primary development data. The patients in both datasets were consenting adult ICU patients with non-neurologic primary ICU diagnosis. A modified Ramsay score was used as a reference of the sedation level. Results The performance of the RI in reference to the Ramsay scores was analyzed by computing the prediction probability (P K ). The development and test data contained 213 and 96 eligible Ramsay assessments, respectively. The P K for separating deep sedation levels 4 to 6 from levels 1 to 3 was 0.91 (0.03) in the development data and 0.96 (0.02) in the test data. For separating all Ramsay levels, the P K values in the development data and test data were 0.82 (0.02) and 0.89 (0.02), respectively. Conclusions These results showed good RI performance in the cardiac ICU data. The RI continues to show promise as an indicator of the level of sedation in ICU patients.References 1.

Introduction Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and sedation protocols during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) can both separately reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in ICU patients. However, no study has shown the impact of these two concepts when associated. Methods All consecutive patients admitted to a 14-bed medical-surgical ICU were retrospectively studied from 2000 to 2006 after implementation of NIV (2000 to 2001) and sedation protocols (2003 to 2004). The duration of mechanical ventilation shown by categories was analyzed using a chi-square test.Results During the 7 years of the study, 2,839 admissions were performed in 2,511 patients (59 ± 17 years, women 36%, medical admission 43%, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 38 ± 17, mortality in the ICU 17%). The incidence and duration of IMV significantly decreased during the study (P <0.001)P Lapinlampi 1 , H Viertiö-Oja 1 , M Särkelä 1 , K Uutela 1 ,

Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineFigure 1 (abstract P404)Introduction Ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) as a new technique for abstinence is in progress. While diarrhea and vomiting are two frequent withdrawal symptoms, clonidine can effectively suppress such complications. This study aimed to investigate the effects of clonidine (oral) on diarrhea and vomiting during and after UROD. Methods A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah, in the west of Iran. We assigned 88 patients to three groups: C1 (0.2 mg) = 29, C2 (0.4 mg) = 29 and C3 (1 mg) = 30 patients. Clonidine was gavaged to patients after general anesthesia. After that, patients were monitored for diarrhea and vomiting during (4 to 5 hours) and after (12 hours) UROD. They were matched with respect to the type of drug abused and its route of administration. Results Three groups were comparable in terms of demographic characteristics and use of treatments except for use of different doses of propofol and midazolam. The most commonly misused drug was crack (19.3%). While there was no statistically differences between three groups in terms of development of diarrhea during UROD, the greater proportion of patients in group C1 (31.0%) developed diarrhea after UROD (P = 0.001). Three groups were comparable in terms of developing vomiting either during or after UROD. Compared with group C2 (1,248 ± 226.4) and C3 (1,100 ± 232.3), the mean dosage of propofol was larger among group C1 (1,336.2 ± 248.9) (P = 0.001). Such results were similarly seen with midazolam (P = 0.04). Conclusions Consistent with some other reports[1], this study showed that the use of larger dose of clonidine can effectively decrease the incidence of diarrhea after UROD. It can also decrease the need for larger doses of hypnotic and sedative drugs.Reference 1.

The outcome measure of delirium was included with those of cardiac and respiratory events Results Of the 403 noncardiac surgical patients, 50 were cared for in the ICU and 353 were cared for in a high-intensity bed or a surgical ward bed postoperatively. Delirium occurred in 10 (20%) patients admitted into the ICU versus 15 (4.2%) of those admitted to the surgical wards (P <0.001). Independent predictors of developing delirium included the patient's age, the PRFI, and assignment to the ICU a priori. The RCRI was not an independent predictor of delirium. (SeeTable 1.) Conclusions In a cohort of patients undergoing high-risk noncardiac surgery, age, PRFI, and assignment to the ICU a priori predicted the development of delirium. Risk factors for intensive care delirium B Van Rompaey, M Elseviers, L Bossaert University of Antwerp, Belgium Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P410 (doi: 10.1186/cc7574)Introduction Delirium is a common complication in the ICU. The attention of researchers has shifted from the treatment to the prevention of the syndrome, necessitating the study of associated risk factors. Methods In a multicenter study of one university hospital, two community hospitals and one private hospital, newly admitted adult patients were included when reaching a Glasgow coma scale greater than 10. Nurse researchers assessed the patients for delirium using the NEECHAM confusion scale. Risk factors were split into four groups: patient characteristics, chronic pathology, acute illness and environmental factors. Odds ratios were calculated using univariate binary logistic regression. Results A total population of 508 patients was screened for delirium. The 36 studied factors showed some variability according to the participating hospitals. The overall delirium incidence was 29%. For patient characteristics, age was not a significant factor. Intensive smoking (OR = 2.04) and living singly at home (OR = 1.94), however, contributed to the development of delirium. In the group of chronic pathology, a pre-existing cognitive impairment seemed important as a risk factor (OR = 2.41). In the group of factors related to acute illness, the use of drains, tubes and catheters, acute illness scores, the use of psychoactive medication, a complete sedation or coma and a preceding period of mechanical ventilation showed significant ORs ranging from 1.04 to 13.66. Environmental risk factors were noise, induced by a high number of alarms (OR = 5.37), isolation (OR = 3.81), the absence of visit (OR = 2.83), the absence of visible daylight (OR = 1.80), a bed in a shared ICU room (OR = 1.70), a transfer from another ward or hospital (OR = 3.01) and admittance through the emergency room (OR = 2.19). The present multicenter study indicated four groups of risk factors for delirium in the ICU. Particularly among those related to the acute illness and the environment, several factors are suitable for preventive action.Introduction Delirium is a frequent problem in the ICU and is associated with a poor prognosis. Delirium in the ICU seems to be underdiagnosed by nursing and medical staff. Several detection methods have been developed for use in ICU patients. The aim of this study was to compare the value of three detection methods (the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and the impression of the ICU physician) with the diagnosis of a psychiatrist, neurologist or geriatrician. Methods All patients were eligible for inclusion. We excluded deeply sedated patients (Ramsay score greater than 4), comatose patients (Glasgow coma score less than 8), patients in whom no informed consent was obtained, patients who did not speak or understand Dutch or English, or patients who were deaf. Delirium evaluations were performed by different investigators independently and blinded to each other assessments. The CAM-ICU was used by a trained ICU nurse, the ICDSC was administered by another ICU nurse, the ICU physician was asked whether a patient was delirious or not. Further, a psychiatrist, geriatrician, or neurologist serving as reference rater diagnosed delirium using DSM-IV criteria, based on all available information.Results During an 8-month period, 126 patients (mean age 62.4, SD 15.0; mean APACHE II score 20.9, SD 7.5) admitted to a 32bed mixed medical and surgical ICU were studied. The CAM-ICU showed higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (64% and 83%) than the ICDSC (43% and 75%). The ICDSC showed better specificity and positive predictive value (95% and 82% vs. 88% and 72%). The sensitivity of the physicians view was only 29%, with 96% specificity, 75% positive predictive value and 74% negative predictive value. Conclusions The present study shows that the impression of intensive care physicians is not sensitive enough to identify delirium. In this investigation in a mixed ICU population, the CAM-ICU had a higher sensitivity than the ICDSC [1]. Reference 1.

During the ICU stay, from the ICU database (FileMaker Pro 5.5v2; FileMaker, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) with authorization of the Careggi Teaching Hospital Committee of the Emergency Department, the following parameters were collected for every patient: age, sex, abbreviated injury scale, injury severity score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, in the field Glasgow coma scale, Marshall score, worst values of lactates and ScvO 2 within 24 hours from trauma, length of sedation and ICU stay. The median of each collected parameter in the group of patients was used as the cutoff value to divide them into two categories: risk factor for memory dysfunction present or absent. A two-by-two analysis was carried out and Fisher's exact test was used for comparisons. P <0.05 was considered significant. Results Memory dysfunction was observed in 15 out of 34 patients. Only Marshall score >2 (8/15 vs. 3/19; P <0.05) represented a significant risk factor for memory dysfunction.


patients who met the criteria for immediate transfer to a level I or II trauma center. Guidelines disseminated through advanced trauma life support (ATLS) facilitate the movement of patients to the appropriate level of care, contributing to a 25% reduction in mortality[1]. Acquisition of CT scans of severely injured patients at outlying nontrauma hospitals violates those guidelines. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of trauma patients transferred from outlying hospitals to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2007 who met criteria for immediate transfer to a level I trauma center (n = 5,707). We used multivariable random-effect logistic regression to explore the association between pretransfer CT scanning and mortality. Secondary outcomes included medical costs attributable to duplicate CT scanning and the clinical outcomes of duration of ventilator dependence, ICU length of stay (LOS), and total LOS. Covariables included patient (age, race, gender, insurance, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS)), provider (ATLS certification) and hospital (trauma level designation) characteristics. Results Of 3,219 patients who received scans prior to leaving the outlying hospital, 2,411 patients had their scans repeated. In our analysis, patients with age >80 years or with an ISS >16 had a higher odds of receiving a scan (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.72 to 2.88; OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.31 to 1.83). Patients after a motorcycle collision, after a penetrating injury, or without insurance had a lower odds of receiving a CT scan (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.63 to 0.96; OR = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.21; OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.73). Acquisition of CT scans prior to transfer did not improve mortality, ICU LOS, total LOS or duration of mechanical ventilation. Using the 2008 Medicare physician fee schedule allowance, we estimated that the duplication of scans resulted in a cost of $2,091,817. Conclusions Despite robust evidence supporting the immediate transfer of severely injured patients, over one-half of the cohort transferred to UPMC Presbyterian received a CT scan prior to their transfer. Performance of scans at outlying facilities increased costs but did not improve outcomes.Reference 1. MacKenzie E: A national evaluation of the effect of trauma center care on mortality.

closure treatment in the adjuvant treatment of the abdominal compartment syndrome A Nella 1 , A Di Filippo 1 , S Matano 1 , M Bonizzoli 2 , M Linden 2 , G Manca 2 , A Peris 2 1 University of Florence, Italy; 2 Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P423 (doi: 10.1186/cc7587) Introduction Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) represents a potentially life-threatening condition in critically ill patients. The control of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) plays a pivotal role in prevention/treatment of ACS. We compared the efficacy of two different therapies -open and open-vacuum-assisted closure (open-VAC) treatment [1] -on resolution of intra-abdominal hypertension/prevention of ACS.Methods We prospectively analyzed data of 26 consecutive patients admitted to the ICU of our emergency department (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence) with sepsis from an abdominal source, hemorrhagic shock, and major trauma. All patients underwent laparotomic surgery before ICU admission with open-VAC treatment. As a control group we retrospective analyzed 17 patients admitted with the same diagnosis and treated with open treatment. IAP was evaluated by measuring the urinary bladder pressure[2]. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, and laboratory parameters were collected from the ICU database (FileMaker Pro 5.5v2; FileMaker, Inc., USA) with authorization of the Careggi Teaching Hospital Committee of the Emergency Department. For each patient, data were collected before the surgical treatment with a closed abdomen (T1), 6 hours after ICU admission (T6), after 24 hours (T24), 24 hours after abdomen closing (T24C), and at monitoring suspension (TMS). Statistical analysis: Student's t test (*P <0.05). Data reported as the mean ± SD.ResultsThe two groups were similar in demographic and clinical characteristics. The open-VAC group patients showed a significantly shorter length of stay in the ICU (open: 20.58 ± 15.97; VAC: 11.46 ± 11.99) and had a shorter time before laparotomy closure (open: 6.82 ± 3.85; VAC: 4.57 ± 2.88) if compared with the control group. Finally, both IAP values from T1 (open: 17.9 ± 6.41; open-VAC: 15.1 ± 5.68) to T24C (open: 15.7 ± 3.4; open-VAC: 12.6 ± 2.63) and lactate levels from T1 (open: 6.34 ± 4.65; open-VAC: 4.1 ± 3.1) to T6 (open: 5.72 ± 5.71; open-VAC:2.62 ± 2.08) and T24 (open: 5.66 ± 5.81; open-VAC: 2.15 ± 2.12) were significantly lower in a time-dependent manner in the open-VAC group. Conclusions The present study suggests that the open-VAC could have more beneficial effects than the traditional open technique in the treatment of patients with intra-abdominal hypertension/ACS. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence, features and consequences of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding (UGITB) in patients admitted to an ICU in a 6-year period.Methods A retrospective observational study in an ICU of a university hospital. We recorded the UGITB episodes of all admissions (6,245 patients) from January 2001 to December 2007 excluding those in whom the UGITB motivated the admission, or it occurred within the first 48 hours. UGITB was defined as: melena and or nasogastric tube bleed with or without anemia, or anemia with a concomitant lesion on G-scope. All patients were on UGITB prophylaxis. Demographic data, APACHE II score, previous medical history and risk factors for the development of UGITB were recorded. Also the information regarding G-scope findings, type of treatment received and consequences of the episode were recorded. Results We included a total of 73 patients (1.17%), 46 male (63%). The average APACHE II score was 22 -global mortality of 49%. The relative incidence distributed for age groups shows more incidence in the 41 to 50 years group. Six patients were on oral anticoagulation (8.2%), 14 on platelet anti-aggregation (19.1%), and one patient on low molecular weight heparin (1.4%). There were 11 patients with chronic liver disease (15% and 3.3% of total admissions (TA), three with previous history of UGITB (4.1% and 1.93% TA), four with peptic ulcer disease (5.5% and 1.16% TA) and two patients with inflammatory bowel disease (2.8%). We analyzed: organ failure, sepsis, coagulopathy and nutrition, and we found an important association of UGITB with sepsis, shock, organ failure and mechanical ventilation nutrition[1]. Presentation of UGITB: hematemesis/bleeding nasogastric tube 52 (71.2%), melenas 10 (13.7%) and acute anemia 11 (15%). Endoscopic findings: ulcers 43%, erosions 37%, esophagitis and gastritis 10%. G-scope was performed in 54 patients (74%): 12 of them (16.4%) required sclerosis, one patient (1.4%) a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube, and two patients (2.8%) arteriography with embolization. Most of the episodes resolved spontaneously. The overall mortality was 49.3% (36 patients); 1.1% of deaths were directly related to the UGITB. Conclusions In our series UGITB is not a common entity, and the most frequent findings were ulcers and erosions. UGITB must be considered a new severity criterion because although it is neither related with the typical predisposing factors nor age, in these patients we observed higher mortality than the expected for their APACHE II score.IntroductionThe advent of multiple trauma is accompanied by lymphopenia often due to apoptosis. This may be due to the existence of a circulating factor modulating apoptosis. The presence of such a factor in the serum of patients was assessed. Methods Serum was sampled at standard time intervals from 21 patients bearing multiple injuries and admitted to the ICU. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from five healthy volunteers after gradient centrifugation over Ficoll. PBMCs were stimulated overnight in a 96-well plate with 0.1 ml sampled serum. The percentage of annexin-V + /PI -/CD4 + cells and annexin-V + /PI -/CD14 + cells were estimated by flow cytometry. Results were compared with those obtained after cell incubation with serum of healthy volunteers. Results Median induction of apoptosis of CD4 lymphocytes and of CD14 monocytes after incubation with serum of healthy volunteers was 1.89% and 30.56%, respectively. Median percentages of apoptotic CD4 lymphocytes and CD14 monocytes of PBMCs after incubation with patient's serum sampled on consecutive days after admission are shown inTable 1. Similar results for patients complicated with sepsis on the first day of its advent are also presented.Introduction P425

We based this hypothesis on the knowledge that ethyl pyruvate (EP) and related enone-containing compounds are protective in numerous in vitro and in vivo models of oxidant-mediated and cytokine-mediated cellular and organ injury. Methods We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of EP and pHPP using U373 cells exposed to IL-1β and RAW 264.7 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide. Volume-controlled HS was initiated by withdrawing 21.7 ml blood per kg body weight over 20 minutes, followed by an additional 14 ml/kg over 40 minutes. A continuous infusion was delivered during the final 20 minutes of hemorrhage. DCA plus 0.25 nM pHPP in 2.8 ml/kg. Results Cell culture studies revealed that pHPP blocked expression of CD54 in U373 cells and blocked release of NO • and decreased induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA in RAW cells at lower concentrations compared with EP.Advent of 



Recombinant activated factor VII: does it really save lives? U Edke Shaikh Khalifa Medical City, Abudhabi, United Arab Emirates Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P429 (doi: 10.1186/cc7593)Introduction At pharmacological doses, recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) bypasses conventional steps in coagulation cascade and directly generates a thrombin burst on the activated platelets at the injury, leading to the generation of fully stabilized tight fibrin clot. Methods Using the experience of our institute and an Internet search. In one of the largest prospective, randomized, multicentric studies of rFVIIa, 301 patients with blunt/penetrating trauma were enrolled -of whom 277 patients at the end of study were analyzable. The trial included 399 patients, all diagnosed by CT scan within 3 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 96), 40 μg/kg (n = 108), 80 μg/kg (n = 92), or 160 μg/kg (n = 103) doses of rFVIIa within 1 hour of the baseline scan. The results of the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-Term Evaluation study (that is, the largest controlled study showing the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and disease) demonstrated that propensity to high factor VII levels is not associated with a risk for myocardial infarction.


The dosage of rFVIIa was 39.23 ± 20.70 μ/kg We used Student's t test for statistical analysis. Results After administration of the first median dose (14.45 to 81.35 μg/kg) of rFVIIa, bleeding stopped in 47 patients. Bleeding was markedly decreased in 15 patients. Five patients who did not benefit from initial rFVIIa administration received additional drug in a dose of 38.25 μg/kg with good results. The average blood loss within 12 hours before treatment was 2,510.00 ± 1,642.07 ml, and the average blood loss within 12 hours after treatment was 1,057.75 ± 810.67 ml. The average dynamics of bleeding before treatment were 216.35 ± 138.82 ml/hour, and 87.90 ± 67.82 ml/hour after treatment. Transfusion requirements were reduced for packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and crystalloid and/or colloids. Reduction in transfusion requirements was statistically significant (P ≤0.05).ConclusionsThe meta-analysis of case series showed that in a mean of 85% patients rFVIIa achieved at least a reduction of bleeding, reducing the need for hemotransfusions.


MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with rFVIIa for massive bleeding secondary to anticoagulation during circulatory assistance between March 2004 and November 2008. rFVIIa use and dosage was decided according to local guidelines when available (released inMay 2006). According to these guidelines, systematic crosscheck for active correction of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulation factors with parallel consideration for any feasible interventional embolisation or haemostatic surgery are required for authorization of rFVIIa use. Results Nine patients with circulatory assistance received rFVIIa. Median patient age was 43 years (<1 to 55). Eight patients underwent cardiac surgery (including two heart transplants). One had a bipulmonary transplant. The device was an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator in seven patients and a ventricular assist device in two patients. Median rFVIIa dose was 100 μg/kg (45 to 180), split into two or three injections in six cases. Bleeding control was obtained in five patients (60%). The mortality rate at 30 days was 40%, including two within 48 hours from failure to control hemorrhage. We observed one thromboembolic complication (stroke) which may potentially be related to rFVIIa administration. Conclusions Our series suggests that the cautious use of rFVIIa may be an option in patients with a circulatory assist device suffering from massive hemorrhage refractory to conventional treatment. Analysis of the off-licence use of recombinant activated factor VII for patients with uncontrolled haemorrhage in a UK tertiary referral hospitalM Spivey, H Eve, M Duffy Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P432 (doi: 10.1186/cc7596)Introduction Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is increasingly used for the treatment of acquired coagulopathies associated with uncontrolled haemorrhage. Consensus guidelines[1]  have been published for the administration of rFVIIa in this setting. We examined the off-licence use of rFVIIa in our 1,071-bed tertiary referral hospital. Methods Hospital blood-bank data were examined from the first offlicence use of rFVIIa in November 2002 until August 2008. Case notes were reviewed on these patients to gain demographics, indications and dosage of rFVIIa. Pathology data were crossreferenced to gain results before and after administration of rFVIIa. Results Twenty-two patients were identified over the 6-year period who received off-licence rFVIIa. The majority of uses were in cardiac surgery (nine patients), followed by general/vascular surgery (five patients), and trauma (four patients). Of these patients, 41% (nine patients) did not survive >24 hours. Mean dosage was 7.8 mg (89.4 μg/kg) and was given after mean transfusions of 24.8 units of packed red cells, 13 units of fresh frozen plasma, 3.5 units of pooled platelets and 2 units of cryoprecipitate, in the preceding 24 hours. At this time, blood tests reveal a mean of 91 platelets (SD = 54.9), but nearly one-quarter of patients received the drug with a platelet count <50; prothrombin time 17.9 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time 58.7 seconds, and pH 7.18. Mean temperature prior to rFVIIa administration was 34.7°C. Full APACHE II data were available for 64% of the patients with a mean of 18.3 (SD = 6.5), and for the trauma patients a mean revised trauma score of 5.9. Following the administration of rFVIIa, the mean prothrombin time reduced to 13.4 seconds at 1 hour. Sixty-eight per cent of patients (15) received blood product transfusions in the immediate 24 hours after having rFVIIa with a mean of 2 units packed red cells, 3.2 units fresh frozen plasma, 1.5 units pooled platelets and 1.1 units cryoprecipitate.P432 



Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine S175 bleeding stopped in eight patients. Bleeding markedly decreased in two patients during 3 hours. Two patients who did not benefit from initial rFVIIa administration received additional drug in a dose of 35.65 μg/kg with good results. No adverse effects were directly related to treatment with rFVIIa. Conclusions Clinical reports and hematologic data suggest improvement for more than 80% of women after rVIIa administration.IntroductionThe study compared the efficacy of viscoelastography (VG) versus thromboelastography (TEG) for monitoring of perioperative coagulation balance after abdominal surgery for cancer.Methods A complete coagulation screen, the activated clotting time (ACT), TEG and VG were performed before surgery and at the end of the operation, and monitoring of LMWH anticoagulation therapy on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7. We tested the hypothesis that the parallel use of standard TEG and VG can fully access the postoperative state of blood coagulation.ResultsThe elastic shear modulus of standard MA (Gt) and VGMVA (Gh), which reflect the total clot strength and procoagulatory protein component, was calculated. The difference was an estimate of the platelet component (Gp). There was a 14% increase of standard MA, corresponding to a 48% increase of Gt (P <0.05) and an 80 to 86% contribution of the calculated Gp to Gt. Using multiple linear regression, all coagulation, TEG and VG variables were used to model perioperative thrombophylia. The results showed that some components of TEG failed to identify hypercoagulation (r <0.2, P <0.75). However, three components of the routine coagulation assay, including the bleeding time, prothrombin time and platelet count, could be modeled to show prolonged postoperative hypercoagulability (P <0.01). We conclude that all components of the VG test reflect postoperative coagulopathies. Serial standard TEG and viscoelastic analysis may reveal the independent contribution of platelets and of procoagulatory proteins to clot strength. Conclusions These results suggest that viscoelastic techniques might be useful in the determining the coagulation status in cancer patients perioperatively. Hypercoagulability is not reflected completely by standard coagulation monitoring and TEG, and seems to be predominantly caused by increased platelet reactivity.Reference 1.

Rabbits without a dilutional coagulopathy demonstrated rapid onset of haemostasis. Post-injury blood loss (BL) and time to haemostasis (TH) were 4.7 ± 2.4 ml and 4.4 ± 1.1 minutes, respectively. After the dilution procedure coagulation factors were reduced to less than 50% of baseline. Haemostasis deteriorated after colloid transfusion (BL 60.0 ± 25.9 ml, TH 19.1 ± 2.2 min).The TGA showed normal lag phase but only 50% of the normal peak thrombin level. The PT was prolonged after the dilution about 1.8-fold. Using PCC treatment it was demonstrated that the peak thrombin level was corrected (P <0.0001) and the BL (21.5 ± 11.1 ml; P <0.01) as well as TH (12.4 ± 1.4 min; P <0.01) were decreased significantly.Conclusions In this rabbit model of a dilutional coagulopathy it was demonstrated that a dilution of coagulation factors of more than 50% affects TGA,PT  and bleeding. Restoration of coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X using PCC corrects the TGA and reduces BL and TH. This model could be used to investigate new drugs in dilutional coagulopathy.

Airway edema combined with obstructive casts produced from cellular debris, fibrin clots, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mucus and mucin B5 are believed to cause the airway obstruction contributing to pulmonary failure. Methods A single-center retrospective study with historical control over a 5-year period of 30 mechanically ventilated adult subjects admitted within 48 hours of their bronchoscopy with confirmed SIJ. Both the experimental (n = 16) group and control (n = 14) groups were treated with ventilator support but the former received in addition 10,000 units of nebulized heparin sulfate mixed in 3 ml normal saline every 4 hours and 3 ml 20% nebulized Nacetylcysteine plus 0.5 ml albuterol sulfate every 4 hours for 7 consecutive days starting on the day of admission. We calculated APACHE III scores on admission in addition to the daily lung injury score for 7 days. Results There was no significant difference in admission APACHE III scores (38.7 vs. 34.6; α = 0.05) or lung injury scores (0.7 vs. 1.1; α = 0.05) between the experimental and control groups. The experimental group showed significant improvement in lung injury scores (P <0.05) over the duration of the study, with the greatest benefit seen over the first 7 days (0.91 ± 0.14 vs. 1.79 ± 0.41; P <0.01). Respiratory resistance and compliance measurements revealed significant improvement in the experimental group reaching a significance level of P <0.01 by day 4. There was a statistically significant survival benefit in the experimental group that was most pronounced in patients with APACHE III scores >35. Survival for the control group versus experimental group was 0.5714 ± 0.1497 versus 0.9375 ± 0.0605, respectively (RR = -0.0055; 95% CI = -0.0314 to 0.0204; HR = 1.003). Conclusions The use of aerosolized unfractionated heparin and Nacetylcysteine attenuates lung injury and the progression of acute lung injury in ventilated adult patients with SIJ.J Belohlavek, V Dytrych, A Kral, O Smid, A Linhart General Teaching Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P441 (doi: 10.1186/cc7605)P438

1presents the classification of phosphate concentrations on admission to the ICU and the minimum reached during their ICU admission. The incidence of hypophosphataemia on admission to GRI ICU is 10%, of which <1% is at a critical concentration. The incidence of hypophosphataemia during the whole of the ICU stay rises to 42%. Five per cent of ICU admissions get critical hypophosphataemia at some point during their ICU stay; 69% of these patients have a normal or high phosphate concentration on admission, 19% have a low admission phosphate and 13% are admitted with a critically low phosphate concentration. Conclusions Hypophosphataemia is common in ICU admissions. Most commonly it develops subsequent to admission to the ICU and reaches critical concentrations in 5% of ICU admissions. The timing of this fall in phosphate may indicate specific pathophysiological processes and merits further investigation.

Audit The median (IQR) patient weight was 75 kg (64 to 85). Ninety-four ICU observation charts had a weight recorded, and of these 38 (40.4%) were estimated. Sixteen out of 20 (80%) medical patients and 22/74 (29.7%) surgical patients had an estimated weight. Sixty-three per cent of patients had a recent accurate weight recorded in the notes and only 43 (68.3%) had the same weight recorded on the ICU observation chart. Seventy per cent of patients required a weight for cardiac output monitoring and 54% for drug dose calculation. Pilot study The median (range) measured weight was 92 (66.8 to 137.4) kg. Twelve out of 18 had an estimated weight on the ICU chart. The mean (precision) of estimation was 10.1 (±21.4) kg.

However, alarms are only suggestive if they indicate critical variations in the patient's condition. Great numbers of false alarms can lead to a crying wolf phenomenon with consecutive ignored critical situations.

Timing of the first review is likely to be influenced by many factors, other than NCEPOD recommendations. which critically ill surgical patients were managed by host surgeons individually. Results A total of 2,269 patients were included in this study (open vs. closed; 1,038 vs. 1,231). The overall ICU mortality rate was decreased statistically significantly in the closed model (27.4% vs. 23.4%; P = 0.03). This effect was obvious in patients who were admitted to the ICU for more than 48 hours (22.7% vs. 13.9%; P <0.01). After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, the relative risk of death in a closed model ICU was 0.85 (0.74 to 0.98; P = 0.02) compared with the open model. The effect was explicit in patients admitted to the ICU for more than 48 hours (0.60 (0.47 to 0.76); P <0.01), in nontraumatic patients (0.81 (0.64 to 1.01)) and a trend toward to statistical significance in patients older than 65 years (0.81 (0.64 to 1.01); P = 0.07). In addition, the closed model ICU also decreased, the length of ICU stay (5.4 ± 7.1 vs. 4.6 ± 6.1 days; P <0.01) and the adjusted risk ratio was 0.45 (0.26 to 0.78; P ≤ 0.01) when compared with the open model. Conclusions The closed model that can be led and managed by an intensivist is associated with a reduction in overall ICU mortality and a greatest effect in patients admitted for more than 48 hours. Furthermore, this model also decreases the ICU length of stay.

Clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of severe acute pancreatitis B Kostadinovska, MS Sosolceva City Surgical Clinic 'St Naum Ohridski' -Skopje, Macedonia Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P501 (doi: 10.1186/cc7665)IntroductionThe aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of a consecutive series of patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). SAP is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Methods Clinical data of SAP patients admitted to our hospital from January 2006 to January 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Collected data included the age, gender, etiology, length of hospitalization, APACHE II score at admission, local and organ/ systemic complications of the patients. Results Of the 125 acute pancreatitis patients, 42 developed SAP[1]. The mean age of SAP patients was 57 years, male/female 22/20 patients, the commonest etiology was cholelitiasis (43.5%), the mean length of hospitalization was 60 days, the mean score of APACHE II was 8.1. Fifty-seven percent of the patients developed necrosis, 23% abscessus, 11% pseudocyst. Fifty-eight percent developed organ/systemic failure. A total of 25.2% (11/42) of the SAP patients died. Respiratory failure was the most common organ dysfunction (90.0%) in deceased SAP patients, follow by cardiovascular failure (86.4%), and renal failure (50.0%). In the SAP patients, 90.9% (9/11) developed multiple organ/systemic failures. There were significant differences in age, length of hospitalization, APACHE II score and incidences of respiratory failure, cardiovascular failure, renal failure between deceased SAP patients and surviving SAP patients

In the subgroup, 90% of patients had APACHE II score ≤8 and 77% of them had SAPS II <20. Both scoring systems had a weak discrimination, with an area under the curve (receiver operating characteristic) 0.655 and 0.557 for SAPS II and APACHE II, respectively. Conclusions APACHE II and SAPS II are not good prognostic tools for status asthmaticus. A new and more adapted evaluation tool is required. Is Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 better than APACHE II to predict mortality in transplanted critical patients? VO Oliveira 1 , E Rodrigues Filho 2 , J Brauner 1 , S Regina Rios Vieira 1 1 Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil; 2 Complexo Hospitalar da Santa Casa de Porto Alegre, Brazil Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1):P506 (doi: 10.1186/cc7670) Introduction The performance of general prognostic models in patients with transplantation in need for ICU admission is poor, showing a tendency towards significant underestimation of the risk of dying. The objective of our study is to evaluate the APACHE II score and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 and their 90-day mortality prediction after liver, renal and pulmonary transplantation. Methods A prospective cohort study in a transplantation ICU in Porto Alegre, Brazil, during the period May 2006 to July 2007. Clinical data of 277 post-transplantation patients admitted to the ICU were collected at admission and the SAPS 3 and APACHE II score calculated with respective estimated mortality rates. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was obtained for both scores. Results Patients enrolled included 172 men and 105 women, with mean age 45 ± 2 years. There were 86 (31%) liver transplantations, 170 (61.3%) renal transplantations and 21 (7.6%) pulmonary transplantations. The 90-day mortality for liver, renal and pulmonary transplantation was: 12 (15.4%), four (3%) and four (26.3%). The mean SAPS 3 score was 40 ± 10.2, 21 ± 5.8 and 63 ± 19, and the APACHE II score was 25 ± 8.2, 16 ± 5.9 and 17 ± 21.4, respectively. Comparing the AUROC from both scores we observed: in liver transplantation the AUROC for SAPS 3 was 0.677 (95% CI = 0.447 to 0.887) versus 0.749 (95% CI = 0.623 to 0.875) for APACHE II; in renal transplantation the AUROC for SAPS 3 was -0.619 (95% CI = 0.355 to 0.882) versus 0.604 (95% CI = 0.355 to 0.882) for APACHE II; in pulmonary transplantation the AUROC for SAPS 3 was -0.936 (95% CI = 0.805 to 1.06) versus 0.750 (95% CI = 0.489 to 1.01) for APACHE II.P506

A post-event ICU re-evaluation round and judicious patient discharge may reduce prolonged overuse of ICU resources. Acknowledgment Supported by Associazione per il Bambino Nefropatico, Milan, Italy.Conclusions EAAT did not affect the outcome. The prognostic factors for severe sepsis and septic shock identified in this study were age, base deficit and ARDS. Introduction Airway aspiration (AWA) of gastric content is a very frequent complication in patients presenting to emergency rooms after incidents linked to a depressed level of consciousness. The routine use of antibiotics in this situation determines a highpressure selection for multiresistant microorganisms. However, how often AWA is the causative situation for early ventilatorassociated pneumonia is not known. Also a gold standard for a diagnostic workup is needed. Our aim was to know how frequent AWA determines infectious aspiration pneumonia confirmed by evolution and microbiological samples, and to propose a methodological approach to rule out antibiotic usage.Methods Over a 2-year period, in 82 patients admitted to our ICU, AWA was confirmed by the direct observation of gastric content when orotracheal intubation was performed by a trained physician due to a Glasgow coma scale below 12. Usual diagnosis: acute brain injury, 52 patients (73%); Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 37 ± 11; age, 44 ± 15 years; all were mechanically ventilated, average 6 ± 2 days; ICU stay ± 10 days; mortality 21%. Rectal fever, leukocytosis, thoracic radiology and PaO 2 /FiO 2 were recorded on a daily basis. The Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) and semiquantitative tracheal aspirates (SQTA) were performed twice: in the first 48 hours and between the third and fifth days. Results Out of 82 patients, 23 (28%) developed clinically and microbiologically confirmed pneumonia. Fever and leukocytosis showed no significant differences in patients with or without pneumonia during the first 5 days. Also the PaO 2 /FiO 2 index was not different. As for radiology, when unilateral focal condensation was present, pneumonia was confirmed later (relative risk = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.7 to6.4). CPIS in the first 48 hours showed a negative predictive value for pneumonia of 89%, and SQTA with no microorganism growth a negative predictive value of 96%. In our patient group, 42 (51%) had CPIS <6 and SQTA growth; in them no antibiotic usage is recommended. On the contrary, out of 20 patients who had CPIS ≥6 and positive SQTA, 16 (75%) developed pneumonia within the first 5 days of the ICU stay; this group deserves antibiotics. CPIS ≥6 without pneumonia, probably due to lung inflammation, was observed in 10 out of 28 patients (36%).Conclusions(1)In our ICU population, pneumonia develops in only 28% of those presenting with AWA. (2) Through CPIS <6 and negative SQTA performed in the first 48 hours we could identify that in more than one-half of AWA patients antibiotics are not needed. Introduction It is known that severe sepsis causes multiple organ failure and high mortality. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used for severe sepsis patients. The mechanism of IVIG is clearly unknown. Suggested, however, is the possibility that IVIG prevents organic injury by suppressing the inflammation. Soluble fibrin (SF) is intermediate between fibrinogen and fibrionoligomer. It is better than fibrinogen as the material for thrombin. IVIG is used as one of the effective factors for repair of the damaged vascular endothelium. In this study we used SF as a marker of severity of illness in patients with or without IVIG and compared the levels of SF in two groups. Methods Nineteen severe septic patients were divided into two groups. The control group (n = 9) was not given and the other group (n = 10) was given IVIG (5 g/day for 3 days). SF of serum from patients was measured on 0 days, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days, and the results were analyzed.ResultsThe levels of SF were: control group: 4.77 ± 9.44 (0 days), 3.13 ± 2.53 (1 day), 3.33 ± 2.75 (3 days), 2.53 ± 2.58 (5 days), 2.58 ± 3.75 (7 days); other group: 7.71 ± 8.28 (0 days), 12.26 ± 16.75 (1 day), 14.34 ± 25.56 (3 days), 8.06 ± 9.08 (5 days), 11.95 ± 12.71 (7 days). There was a significant difference in the levels of SF between groups with and without IVIG at 1 day, 5 days and 7 days. Conclusions Monocyte has the Fcγ receptor. It is thought that stimulating Fcγ of monocyte with IgG plays a role in increasing SF. Without severe DIC, increasing fibrin is used in the repair of the damaged vascular endothelium as a matrix and it prevents the invasion of germs. It is thought that increasing fibrin is the appropriate stimulation for coagulation and one of the reactions of biomechanical defense. We think SF is one of the important factors for the damaged cell and a useful marker of severity for severe sepsis. We also think IVIG is effective for severe sepsis. Introduction Previous studies have recommended the use of lowdose corticosteroids in patients with septic shock. Specifically, response to corticotropin tests has been recognized as a prognostic factor in critically ill patients, especially in patients with no response to the corticotropin test. A recent large randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids revealed no benefit on overall survival or in patients with no response to corticotropin in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Recently, recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients were published as consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine[1]. However, some studies were not included in these statements. Methods We conducted a systematic search of EMBASE and MEDLINE (through August 2008) for double-blind randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effect of corticosteroids on mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Study selection criteria were all trials before August 2008 in which participants were randomized to corticosteroids or placebo and in which mortality was reported.Results Data from 17 randomized, controlled trials with a total of 3,638 participants were analyzed. Corticosteroid use was not associated with a risk reduction in overall mortality (pooled risk ratio = 0.99 (95% CI = 0.90 to 1.09), P = 0.823). Low-dose corticosteroids (150 to 300 mg/day) did not show benefit on allcause mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (risk ratio = 0.92 (95% CI = 0.79 to 1.06)). Furthermore, low-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock who did not respond to the corticotropin test showed no benefit on 28-day mortality (risk ratio = 0.91 (95% CI = 0.76 to 1.09)). Corticosteroids use was not associated with increased complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or increased infections. Conclusions This meta-analysis indicated that administration of low-dose corticosteroids was not beneficial on overall mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Introduction Hospital-acquired pneumonia and its most serious manifestation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, are associated with high rates of mortality and account for 25% of all infections in the ICU[1]. Pneumonia in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients is often complicated by the involvement of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria[2]. This multinational study explored physicians' prescribing behaviour when treating Gram-negative pneumonia in MV patients. Methods Online interviews were conducted with 510 critical/ intensive care, infectious disease and pulmonary/respiratory specialists in the USA (n = 130), Germany (n = 100), Mexico (n = 100), Spain (n = 80) and Japan (n = 100). Participants were practicing physicians (3 to 31 years), were involved in the management of MV patients and were familiar with treatment strategies for pneumonia.ResultsThe involvement of Gram-negative (vs. Gram-positive) bacteria in pneumonia in MV patients was perceived to carry greater mortality risks. Most physicians (63 to 77% in all countries except Japan; 41% in Japan) were extremely concerned about the impact on treatment outcomes of increasing antibiotic resistance in Gramnegative species. Excessive antibiotic use and failure to effectively de-escalate antibiotic therapy were perceived as key contributors to resistance development. Achieving rapid cure (78%) and minimizing the duration of MV (76%) were cited as the most important aims of treatment. Key considerations for antibiotic selection were activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including MDR strains, and relative extent of lung tissue penetration. Over 80% of respondents saw aerosolized antibiotics as a valuable potential addition to the current treatment armamentarium (no antibiotic aerosols are currently licensed for pneumonia), particularly for elderly patients and those with respiratory distress, who are at risk of the worst outcomes.Conclusions Gram-negative pneumonia in MV patients is a serious complication in ICUs. Antibiotic prescribing for Gram-negative pneumonia among respondents is influenced by the risk of MDR bacterial involvement. Aerosolized antibiotics are seen as a potentially valuable adjunct to systemic therapies for treating Gram-negative pneumonia in MV patients.IntroductionThe aim was to produce and pilot a data collection proforma aiding the diagnosis of sepsis in the burns population. It should be relevant, reliable and lead to reproducible results. We also looked at the data collected to assess the relevance of any findings. In June 2007, the American Burn Association Consensus Conference[1]produced standardized definitions in an attempt to aid clarification of sepsis in those already fulfilling the diagnosis of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This would allow more consistent diagnosis and accuracy to further trials occurring in this field. The intention is that the proforma will be used by the INTERBURNS research group for a large prospective study.Methods This was a retrospective case series. Patients included were those admitted to a regional burns unit with more than 20% burns during December 2007, numbering four. These patients were matched for age, sex, and mechanism of injury. The initial proforma was produced on the basis of the American Burn Association recommendations[1]. Data were collected and reviewed. This revealed potential confounding factors, so the proforma was modified and data recollected. A daily diagnosis of SIRS and sepsis was made from the information collected. Results Data were collected at 12 p.m. daily initially. It was noted that haemofiltration and noradrenaline were routinely used. Dressing changes occurred in the morning, leading to increased analgesia, sedation and the release of inflammatory mediators confounding physiological parameters measured. Therefore the proforma was modified and the data recollected at 6 a.m. daily, thus achieving reliable and reproducible data. Despite the small numbers, the data indicated a potential association between an increase in noradrenaline dose of 25% and either instigation of a treatment modality or a diagnosis of SIRS not previously identified, or both. Overall, the median duration of antibiotic therapy was 6 days (IQR 1 to 10), 4 days (IQR 0 to 7) when the PCT algorithm was followed and 10 days (IQR 8 to 14) when it was overruled, respectively. In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, median days on antibiotic therapy was 7 days (IQR 4 to 10), which was similar to the PCT group in a trial in the same institution (P = 0.44)[1].ConclusionsIntroductionIn previous smaller trials, a procalcitonin algorithm reduced antibiotic use in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. However, the feasibility and safety of this approach in a multicenter setting has not been demonstrated. Methods We enrolled 1,359 consecutive patients with lower respiratory tract infections admitted to emergency departments of six tertiary-care hospitals in Switzerland. Patients were randomized to administration of antibiotics based on a procalcitonin algorithm with predefined cutoff ranges for initiating or stopping antibiotics (procalcitonin group) or according to standard guidelines (control group). Procalcitonin was measured locally in each hospital and instructions were web-based. The primary endpoint of this noninferiority trial was the composite adverse outcome of death, ICU admission, disease-specific complications or recurrent infection requiring antibiotic treatment within 30 days.ResultsThe rate of overall adverse outcomes was similar in the procalcitonin and the control group (15.5% vs. 18.9%; difference -3.4%, 95% CI = -7.5% to 0.5%). In the procalcitonin group, antibiotic exposure (that is, number of days on antibiotics per patient) was significantly lower as compared with the control group overall (34.8% reduction, P <0.001), and in subgroups of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (n = 925, 32.4% reduction), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 228, 50.4% reduction) and acute bronchitis (n = 151, 65.0% reduction). Antibiotic-associated side effects were less frequent in the procalcitonin group as compared with the control group (19.8% vs. 28.1%; P <0.001).Conclusions In this multicenter setting, without increasing the rate of adverse outcomes, procalcitonin guidance markedly reduced antibiotic exposure and antibiotic-associated side effects in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00350987.P387Optimization of antibiotic therapy by procalcitonin Methods Twenty pigs (30 ± 2.5 kg) were anesthetized and ventilated. A laparotomy was performed for instrumentation and a colon anastomosis. After baseline measurements the animals were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: Group HES, hydroxyethyl starch (130/0.4) was given to maintain SvO 2 ≥60%; Group EA, in addition to the same colloid treatment an epidural catheter was inserted at the lumbar level and after a bolus of 4 ml ropivacain 0.2%, 7 ml/hour were continuously administered. The CO and MBF in the mucosa of the jejunum, colon and anastomosis were measured.ResultsIn both groups the CO and MBF increased similarly(Table 1). No difference in the circulatory parameters between the two groups was found. However, in Group EA significantly more fluids (56%) were administered to achieve SvO 2 ≥60%. Introduction Pinhole gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are easier, more time sparing and much more animal friendly in the assessment of the left ventricular (LV) function in rats compared with the techniques used in the past. Where the aim of previous studies was to determine the cardiac function under different anaesthetics in an extracorporeal model, the aim of our study is to find the ideal anaesthetic for the assessment of the cardiac function in the rat.Methods Two different studies were performed using pinhole gated SPECT and TTE in male Wistar rats. For the TTE study 32 rats were randomised to four groups and were anaesthetized with two different products with a washout period of 3 days. A linear probe was used for assessing M-mode images and LV volumes (ml) were calculated using an ellipsoid model 10 minutes after administration of anaesthesia. Pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, propofol (200 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, midazolam (70 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, isoflurane (2%), sevoflurane (2%) or desflurane (7%) were the anaesthetics studied. For the pinhole gated SPECT study, 48 rats were scanned two times with a 1-week interval: once under pentobarbital (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally) anesthesia for the control study, and a second time using the same anesthetics as the TTE study. Pinhole gated SPECT was performed 1 hour after intravenous injection of 330 MBq 99m Tc-MIBI. Parameters of cardiac function were derived using quantitative gated SPECT.ResultsAugmented ejection fractions were observed for midazolam compared with all other anaesthetics (85% in the SPECT study and 91% in the TTE study). Anterior wall thickening was remarkably augmented: 84 ± 9% compared with propofol 51 ± 12% (P <0.001) and pentobarbital 64 ± 23 (P = 0.03) in the TTE study, but no difference was observed in the inferior thickening. In the SPECT study, augmented wall thickening was observed in the lateral, inferior, septal and anterior region (all P <0.001) compared with pentobarbital. Conclusions Anaesthetic agents seem to play a role in regional contractile function, affecting global LV function. Previous studies demonstrate conflicting results concerning the effect of midazolam on cardiac function. Both of our studies suggest that, at the given dose, midazolam has a positive inotropic effect.P402Comparison of cerebral hemodynamic variables in hemorrhagic stroke using dexmedetomidine-propofol versus dexmedetomidine-midazolam FJ Introduction Dexmedetomidine has been described as having a positive cerebral hemodynamic effect by reducing the cerebral blood flow/cerebral metabolic index ratio (CBF/CMI ratio) and improving CFB self-regulation; however, no data are available on how this actually modifies brain metabolism. Methods We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized, active comparator (dexmedetomidine-propofol or dexmedetomidine-midazolam) study. We included consecutive adult patients (>18 years old) admitted to ICUs with hemorrhagic stroke and moderate or severe brain edema (measured directly at surgery or by CT scan) who needed sedation for at least 72 hours after randomization. We excluded patients with mild brain edema, contraindications to the use of sedatives and those who could not have a jugular venous line placed. Randomized groups received sedation using dexmedetomidine + midazolam (Group 1) or dexmedetomidine + propofol (Group 2). We obtained basal measurement of several variables indirectly related to cerebral metabolism (jugular venous O 2 saturation -SvjO 2 , jugular arteriovenous O 2 difference -Da-vjO 2 , cerebral oxygen extraction -CEO 2 , estimated cerebral metabolic rate -ECMRO 2 ) and repeated these measurements after 72 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square and proportions for categorical variables, and the median, standard deviation and Student t test for continuous variables. We considered P ≤0.05 significant. Results Twenty-eight consecutive patients were included (15 male), average age 61.2 ± 8.6 years, presenting with moderate brain edema (5/28, 17.9%) or severe brain edema (23/28, 82.1%). Both randomized groups had 14 patients. We found no difference between groups in SvjO 2 (P = 0.49 basal, P = 0.19 at 72 hours), Da-vjO 2 (P = 0.68 basal, P = 0.67 at 72 hours), CEO 2 (P = 0.49 basal, P = 0.19 at 72 hours), or ECMRO 2 (P = 0.34 basal, P = 0.50 at 72 hours).Conclusions No significant differences in the measured brain metabolism variables were found among the two groups. We suggest comparing these two groups versus a placebo group in another study. After extubation a PCA pump with T was placed to promote optimal analgesia. In the first group K was added (0.5 mg/ml) to the pump (Gk, n = 6), in the second group it was MgSO 4 (0.03 mg/ml) (Gm, n = 6), in the third group MgSO 4 was adjunct to K (Gm-k, n = 6) and in the last group NaCl 0.9% was added and served as the control group (Gc, n = 6 2 hours, the volume of distribution was 1.03 l/kg, and the clearance was 0.33 l/kg/hour. Data from 15 patients could be analysed after the fifth dose and from five patients after the 21st dose. The PK of intravenous PCM in our population show a biphasic profile (Figure 1). One hour after the dose, the mean serum concentration level was below the therapeutic level. In 18 out of 19 patients serum concentration dropped below 5 mg/ml before the next dose, resulting in a lack of build-up of a suitable therapeutic level of PCM after multiple dosages. Conclusions The recommended dose of 1 g intravenous PCM four times daily is not sufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect in critically ill patients. This can be explained by the low serum levels reached. These results warrant the development of an adequate dosing scheme for intravenous PCM followed by a large clinical trial studying the effects and safety of this regimen in critically ill patients. However, our clinical experience shows that the method of assessing hematocrit is of crucial importance when implementing a strict trigger-dependent transfusion practice with the aim of preventing unnecessary transfusions, especially in nonbleeding critically ill patients. The aims of the present study were therefore to compare two different hematocrit-assessing methods used in clinical routine and to determine whether the results obtained by these two methods would influence our RBC transfusion management. Methods A total of 50 patients treated on our ICU for at least 5 days in which daily blood counts including hematocrit analysis were performed were investigated (250 paired samples). Hematocrit was analyzed using our blood gas analyzer (ABLflex 800) located on our ICU and the routine method used by the central laboratory (ADVIA ® 2120). Post hoc, patients were grouped according to the predefined transfusion triggers (24% and 28%) used on our surgical ICUs for different illnesses.Results Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements showed a good correlation with a bias of +1.39% and two standard deviations were ± 3.12%. The 24% hematocrit group (n = 30) showed a correlation of r 2 = 0.87 and the kappa was 0.56; that is, 22.7% of the cases would have been differently transfused. In the 28% hematocrit group (n = 20) there was a correlation of r 2 = 0.8 and the kappa was 0.58; that is, 21% of the cases would have been differently transfused.Conclusions Despite a good agreement between the two methods with which hematocrit is determined in clinical routine, the calculated difference of 1.4% will substantially influence transfusion practice, resulting in erroneous RBC transfusion in approximately 21% of our patients. This, in turn, could endanger these patients. Consequently, the transfusion trigger used in clinical routine is strongly dependent on the used method of analysis and must be taken into account. shown to improve their clinical status. We investigated the effect of correction of anemia on cardiac function in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) with just intravenous iron. Methods Sixty-four patients with severe CHF (NYHA III or IV), a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≤35% despite maximally tolerated doses of CHF medication and whose hemoglobin levels (Hb) were <12 gr% were randomized into two equal groups: treatment group (n = 32) receiving iron sucrox complex (200 mg weekly for 6 weeks), and control group (n = 32) receiving saline. Patients did not receive erythopoietin throughout the study. Results SeeFigure 1.Conclusions Correction of anemia may be an important addition to the treatment of CHF. Intravenous iron is a simple therapy that increases Hb, reduces symptoms and improves EF in anemic patients with CHF.P417 Effect of length of storage of red blood cell units on outcome in critically ill childrenIntroductionThe World Health Organisation states that it is not a case of if, but when, the next influenza pandemic strikes. In the event of a pandemic, intensive care resources are predicted to be overwhelmed[1]. One means of allocating and maintaining ICU support is the triage protocol developed by Christian and colleagues[2]based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, comorbidity, and age. This study assesses the efficacy of the triage criteria on all patients admitted to our 28-bed ICU.Methods Data required to apply the triage protocol were collected for consecutive critical care admissions over a 60-day period. Triage categories were assigned as per the protocol and the outcome data were collected from the hospital patient data system.ResultsOf the 255 admissions, 190 were nonelective. Of these, the triage category was blue (that is, would have been refused admission to ICU) on admission for 32, and a further 29 who were not (that is, were deemed appropriate ICU admissions by the triage protocol) became blue by 48 hours. Of these 61 patients, 29 were discharged from hospital alive. For our sample of emergency admissions, the sensitivity of the triage protocol for correctly identifying patients at admission who survive to hospital discharge was 0.87. The corresponding specificity was 0.27. Conclusions Thirty-two per cent of emergency admissions would have been denied critical care using the triage protocol, of which 48% survived to hospital discharge. We conclude that the triage criteria are not fit for purpose: they are neither sensitive nor specific enough to differentiate survivors from nonsurvivors, and would still leave clinicians with too many patients for too few beds. Results Fifty-nine patients were identified, 54 (91.5%) were male and five (8.5%) were female. Age ranged from 4 to 60 years. The indication for ventilator treatment was isolated head injury in 28 (47.5%) patients, polytrauma in 13 (22%) patients, polytrauma with severe head injury in nine (15.3%) patients and isolated airway and ventilation indication in the remaining nine (15.3%) patients. Thirty-seven patients had a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 3 to 8, 13 had GCS of 9 to 12, and nine patients had GCS of 13 to 15. The first arterial blood gas was done within 10 minutes of ventilator treatment in 48 (81%) of the cases, whereas the second was done within 90 minutes in 41 (69.5%) of the cases. In 23 (39%) patients, pCO 2 was less than 30 mmHg on the first gas, and in 19 (32%) patients on the second gas. Oxygenation was adequate with levels above 200 mmHg in 40 (68%) of initial and in 47 (80%) of second gases. The most common ventilatory manipulation was a reduction in minute volume after the first gas in 14 (24%). Reduction of inspiratory oxygen was the most common change after the second gas in 28 (47%). The number of cases that should have had ventilatory adjustment was reduced from 12 (20%) after the first arterial blood gas to one (1.7%) after the second.Conclusions Although there was a tendency to hyperventilate patients on ventilators in the emergency department in our institution, satisfactory ventilation was achieved almost uniformly after the second blood gas analysis. Introduction Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dosing protocols for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in critically ill patients (CIPs) are not based on pharmacologic studies in these patients. Antithrombotic LMWH activity correlates with peak antiactivated factor X (aFXa) levels (4 hours post injection) of 0.1 to 0.2 IU/ml. The hypothesis of this study is that most CIPs do not achieve therapeutic levels for prevention of DVT.Methods A prospective study of CIPs randomized to receive enoxaparin once daily intravenously 0.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously 0.5 mg/kg or subcutaneously 40 mg. Blood was sampled for peak and trough aFXa levels(5 daysMost were admitted for diseases of the digestive/respiratory systems (ICD-9). APACHE scores were 19 ± 4 (range 12 to 29). Forty percent underwent surgery before ICU admission (n = 14). Upon inclusion, 34% (n = 12) were receiving noradrenalin, blood pressures averaged 83 ± 6 mmHg, blood creatinine 1.08 ± 0.27, platelets 206,942 ± 95,128 and International Normalized Ratio 1.3 ± 0.16. No protocol resulted in aFXa levels within the therapeutic range; peak levels were too high and trough levels too low. The only significant difference between patients receiving/notreceiving noradrenalin was found in the trough levels of the SQ 0.5 mg/kg protocol. Hemorrhagic/thorombotic complications included: one gastrointestinal bleeding (SQ 40 mg) and two distal inferior limb DVTs (SQ 0.5 mg/kg and intravenous 0.5 mg/kg protocols). ICU length of stays averaged 9 ± 6 days (median 8, range 4 to 33). Three patients died for causes seemingly unrelated to the study (overwhelming fungal sepsis, severe pneumonia and malignant reperfusion syndrome post carotid endarterectomy).Conclusions Current DVT prophylaxis protocols do not result in peak aFXa levels within the recommended antithrombotic range in CIPs. This suggests subtherapeutic levels of LMWH activity and should lead to further studies on optimal dosing in these patients. Introduction Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic complication of pregnancy. The incidence of AFE is very rare, and the clinical presentation; central hemodynamic data in humans are typically obtained more than 1 hour after the event and from only the subset of women who have survived the initial insult. This makes the exact pathophysiology remain elusive, despite numerous attempts at understanding AFE syndrome. We tried to evaluate the effect of amniotic fluid on blood coagulation by making a simple invitro model, using an activated clotting time (ACT) monitor. Methods Sixteen healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. A venous sampling line was inserted before induction of anesthesia. After artificial rupture of the membrane, amniotic fluid was carefully obtained by the surgeon. At the same time, 10 ml venous blood was obtained from the sampling line, and two series of samples were made; (1) 5 ml venous blood with 0.1 ml amniotic fluid (group 1), and (2) 5 ml venous blood alone (group 2 = control). ACT was measured using 2 ml sample in each group.ResultsThe ACT was 66.5 ± 20.9 seconds in Group 1 versus 102.4 ± 15.8 seconds in Group 2 (P <0.0001). Especially, there was one case that coagulated immediately after mixing the amniotic fluid and the ACT could not be obtained in Group 1 (excluded from analysis). The strong coagulation ability by amniotic fluid was induced immediately, even in very small doses.Conclusions A dose of 0.1 ml was enough to form the 5 ml venous blood thrombosis, which is thought to be a sufficient amount to cause AFE, and we consider that its pathophysiology resembles pulmonary embolism. We suggest that AFE may be induced by a smaller dose such as 0.1 ml amniotic fluid than it had been thought. A part of the mechanism of amniotic fluid embolism in humans can be explained by pulmonary embolism theory by making a simple in vitro AFE model.P441Is it safe to thrombolyse patients with pulmonary embolism and right heart mobile thrombi? Results During the prospective step we observed an increase in prophylaxis prescription: elastic stockings administration increased from 42.80% to 64.00% (P <0.000) and the use of pneumatic compression devices increased from 3.17% to 4.90% (P = NS); low molecular weight heparin (U/kg) prescription did not change over the study periods. In the prospective phase the DVT incidence in the ICU was 4.5%, significantly lower than the 10.31% observed in the retrospective step (P <0.05). This reduction was obtained in spite of the increase in the number of CUS screening for DVT: from 1.94 ± 1.38 CUS/patient (retrospective phase) to 2.42 ± 2.02 CUS/patient (P <0.014).Conclusions ICU physician involvement in DVT risk management can be achieved through a training program to practice CUS screening and introduction of a DVT risk scoring form into the clinical practice. In our ICU these interventions were associated with a significant reduction in DVT incidence. Introduction Administration of resuscitation fluids has been associated with the development of metabolic and electrolytic disturbances. The duration and severity of such metabolic acidosis appear to depend on many factors, and the acidosis may continue for hours after the initial intervention. It is unknown whether different types of fluids may affect such changes differently. Ringerfundin is a recently developed crystalloid with similar properties to human plasma, perhaps resulting in less electrolytic and acid-basic disorders. Accordingly, we conducted a randomized controlled study of fluid resuscitation in a clinical oncologic ICU. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of resuscitation on patients' electrolyte concentrations and acid-base status.P444Methods Forty patients in the first hours after diagnosis of septic shock (early hours) were randomized to receive solutions of either Ringer's lactate (n = 20) or Ringerfundin (n = 20) for fluid resuscitation. The amount of fluid needed to reach the goals of therapy was compared between groups. Also, bicarbonate, base excess, pH, chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, albumin, anion gap, SIDe, SIG and lactate were compared at baseline, 2 hours after initial therapy, 6 hours after and 24 hours after. Results There were no differences in demographic, baseline characteristics, electrolytic and acid-basic status of the groups before therapy. After randomization, bicarbonate and base excess increased significantly at 2 hours and 6 hours in the Ringerfundin group compared with Ringer's lactate group (P <0.0001). Patients who received Ringer's lactate presented a significantly greater increase in serum chloride (P <0.002) and a lower clearance of lactate after 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours (P <0.002). There were no differences in amount of fluid needed, SIG, SIDe and anion gap between groups.Conclusions When comparing Ringer's lactate and Ringerfundin, the choice of resuscitation fluid is an independent predictor of acid-base status and serum electrolytes. Ringerfundin administration was associated with a better preservation of electrolytic and acid-basic pattern.P450Comparative study of factors that contribute to the severity of metabolic alkalosis in a surgical ICU ) at a certain time during their hospitalization. Patients were divided into two groups; group I included those with 7.45 <pH ≤7.55 and group II those with pH >7.55. Statistical analysis was performed between groups with regard to gender, age, type of surgery, blood urea concentration, white blood cell count, hematocrit, APACHE II score, serum potassium concentration, creatinine levels, total bilirubin levels, the presence of sepsis criteria, the recurrence of the disorder, the need for mechanical ventilation, the total days of the disorder, the length of hospital stay, the post-admittance day when the maximum pH was recorded, the post-surgery day of maximum pH, the use and the quantity of furosemide adminis-tration, the use and quantity of dobutamine administration, the use of human albumin and the survival. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of chi-square for comparison of data. Results Data charts from 1999 to 2005 were reviewed. In total, 987 patients were admitted to the ICU in this time period. Of these, 239 (24.2%) patients developed metabolic alkalosis at a certain time in their course. Group I included 210 patients (87.9%) and group II included 29 patients (12.1%). From the parameters that were analyzed, statistical significance was observed between the two groups in the value of the blood urea concentration, in the amount of sepsis criteria that were present and in the development of recurrence. We did not observe a statistical difference between the groups in creatinine levels, in the furosemide quantity or in serum potassium concentration. Conclusions The severity of metabolic alkalosis is affected by renal function as expressed by blood urea concentration and the severity of sepsis-septic shock. Moreover, unlike what we expected, furosemide administration did not prove of importance in the development of the alkalosis in this study. Introduction Hypernatraemia is a prognostically serious complication in the neurointensive care unit. A typical, well-known syndrome associated with acute brain disease is central diabetes insipidus (cDI). However, cDI is not a frequent reason of hypernatraemia in neurointensive care. There are other causes of hypernatraemia, most frequently osmotherapy by mannitol or renal failure[1]. The purpose of our study was to evaluate retrospectively all hypernatraemias in patients with acute brain diseases admitted to our neurologic-neurosurgical care unit (NNICU) over a period of 5 years. Methods We analysed all patients with acute brain disease and serum sodium above 150 mmol/l. Firstly we diagnosed cDI according to serum and urine osmolality, hourly diuresis, renal function parameters and response to desmopressin. The remaining hypernatraemias were categorised as non-cDI. Patients without measured serum osmolality were excluded. Results There were 75 hypernatraemic patients (mean age 56.8 years; 41 male) with the following diagnoses: stroke 43, tumour 20, trauma 7, hydrocephalus 4 and epilepsy 1. The mean Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on onset of hypernatraemia was 12 ± 3.4, the mean Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) upon discharge from the NNICU was 3.3 ± 1.4. We found cDI only in eight patients (altogether 15 days). We classified 59 patients as non-cDI hypernatraemia (163 days). The remaining patients were not evaluated because they had no serum osmolality measurements. Between the two groups there were no differences in GCS (P = 0.631), GOS (P = 0.857), serum sodium (P = 0.736), and serum osmolality (P = 0.476), but patients with cDI had low urine osmolality (P = 0.001). On the other hand, the non-cDI group received more antioedematic therapy (P = 0.013) and diuretics (P = 0.019). In this group, mannitol was received in 48 (81.4%) patients and six (10.2%) had creatinine clearance below the reference range (range <1.15 ml/s). Conclusions In neurointensive care cDI is not the most common type of hypernatraemia. Most hypernatraemias are non-cDI due to anti-oedematic therapy and kidney dysfunction.IntroductionThe sexual hormone pattern of the chronic critically ill patient has been recently considered as one of determinants of the catabolic state that delays recovery and conditions the outcome of the disease. It is characterized by a reduction of the pituitary production of luteinizing hormone-follicle-stimulating hormone (LH-FSH) and consequently of the peripheral androgens; on the contrary, the levels of estrogens are increased due to the enhanced activity of aromatase[1]. The objective of our study was to evaluate the pattern of sexual hormone production to identify a correct replacement therapy. Methods Thirteen men with chronic critical illness with a mean age of 70 years and a mean APACHE score of 18 have been enrolled. Patients with endocrinological pathologies or in therapy with hormones, cortisones or dopamine have been excluded. The analysis of the sexual endocrine function was determined on the seventh day of stay in the ICU, considering the mean of four nocturnal measurements of LH-FSH, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone and estradiol. Results Only three patients showed a reduction of LH-FSH under normal levels, 10 patients had normal levels of LH-FSH. All 13 patients had normal or elevated levels of androstendione, a precursor of testosterone. Levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were decreased under normal levels in all patients. Levels of estrogens were elevated above normal levels in all patients.ConclusionsThe present study shows that in the early phase of chronic critical illness the reduction of testosterone could only partially be determined by the decreased pituitary stimulation. The normal levels of androstenedione, a precursor of testosterone, suggest an impairment of the intracellular pathway of androgen production through an inhibition of the 17β-hydroxysteroidodehydrogenase. Considering these results, an exogenous stimulation of testosterone production with LH-FSH secretagogues could be unisexual or not sufficient to rebalance the testosterone levels[2]. Furthermore, the increased conversion of peripheral androgens in estrogens mediated by aromatase is confirmed in this study. The use of aromatase inhibitors could be considered as a therapeutic way to rebalance the hormone axes in critical illness. rate was 23.3% (seven out of 30) and hospital mortality was 30% (nine out of 30 Results Nine patients were admitted because of acute respiratory failure: APACHE II score ranged from 17 to 28, X-ray showed diffuse alveolar infiltrates, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ranged from 75 to 184, only two patients had positive cultures of bronchial secretions. Two patients were admitted after major surgical operation, one after necrotizing pancreatitis: APACHE II score ranged from 9 to 21, X-ray showed diffuse alveolar infiltrates with a cavity in one, PaO 2 /FiO 2 >300, the bronchial secretions cultures were negative. One patient was admitted because of coma and one other because of shock: APACHE II score was 25 and 32, respectively, X-ray without any acute process, PaO 2 /FiO 2 was >200 and none of them had positive cultures of bronchial secretions. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on six patients: on the second day from ICU admission in four patients, on the eighth day in one patient and on the 21st day in one patient. The total mortality rate was 50% (7/14). Conclusions Early bronchoalveolar lavage (during the first 48 hours from admission) could help in differential diagnosis between: exacerbation of rheumatic disease, infection, drug-induced respiratory failure, and alveolar hemorrhage.P463 Distances covered by ICU nurses during their shifts E Nahk, S FrolovaIntroductionThe system of an inhospital rapid response team (RRT) is desired to be set up. Our hospital adopted a unique rapid response system (RRS) constructed with two different systems (organized and systematic system to activate RRT members, and nonorganized and nonsystematic system to gather doctors and nurses near the scene) with an inhospital whole paging system (doctor call (DC)). The object of this study is to clarify the usefulness and problems of our RRS. Methods We examined the records of 55 patients enrolled in our RRS for the past 2.5 years and evaluated the change of the death rate in whole discharged patients before and after the establishment of the RRS. Our unique RRS is as follows. A hospital staff member who finds a collapsed patient/visitor or a patient/visitor requiring urgent medical support or another staff near the scene calls the inhospital whole paging system (DC), which is announced in all areas of the hospital. Staff of the Critical Care and Emergency Center (CCE Center) bring an automated extracorporeal defibrillator and one bag prepared for the emergency crisis for one person. Other staff near the scene bring a monitor, oxygen, emergency cart and stretcher. We established an inhospital educational course for basic life support and basic resuscitation skill and a self-educating system using an e-learning system.ResultsThe events mainly occurred in the diagnostic and treatment room, waiting area, examination room for blood sampling or X-ray examination in the outpatient department (55%) and in the lavatory (5%). They seldom occurred in the critical care area (2%). The reasons why bystanders decided to start up the RRS are suspected cardiac arrest (13%), loss of consciousness (18%), witnessed falling down (31%), and lying down (16%). The mean time interval between the event and DC is 0.96 and that between the event and responding staff arrival at the scene is 1.81 minutes, respectively. The definitive diagnoses were cardiopulmonary arrest in 15%, cardiac event in 5% and psychiatric in 27%. In nine cardiopulmonary arrest cases, 33% were identified as an indication of resuscitation because of 'do not attempt resuscitation' during activity.The. While acute coronary syndrome remained the most common diagnosis (33% vs. 32%), a larger proportion of patients were admitted due to cardiogenic shock (8% vs. 26%) and sepsis (2% vs. 8%). More patients were admitted after out-ofhospital cardiac arrest (8% vs. 25%) and on MV (14% vs. 35%). ICU mortality increased from 9% to 22% with subsequent mortality outside the ICU equal at 4% for both cohorts. The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on the admission day increased from 2.1 ± 2.9 to 7.6 ± 2.8 for survivors and 7.7 ± 4.8 to 10.8 ± 3.0 for the dead. ICU length of stay (LOS) increased from 5 ± 10.2 to 8 ± 12.2 days for survivors and 7 ± 10.8 to 12 ± 14.8 days for the dead, while hospital LOS was nearly unchanged regardless of survival status. Physician staffing and nurse-to-patient ratios did not change (two physicians and 1:3 during days and one physician and 1:4 during nights).ConclusionsThe implementation of an intermediate care unit led to a significant change in the ICU case-mix with increased ICU LOS, mortality and severity of illness of patients admitted. Effects on nurse workloads, team job satisfaction, and critical care triage should be further analyzed to optimize the treatment of these critically ill patients. Wardwatcher™, was used to retrospectively gather data from the 12 months preceding, and 12 months following critical care involvement in the HDU. We investigated three outcome measures of patients who required transfer to the ICU from the HDU during these periods: requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT), length of stay (level 3 days), and ICU mortality. Results Following critical care involvement in the HDU, the total number of HDU admissions per annum fell from 1,372 to 1,197, allowing for the closure of two HDU beds. Ninety-three patients were transferred to the ICU from the HDU in the pre-change 12 months, compared with 67 subsequently. There were no significant differences in age, APACHE II scores, or requirement for mechanical ventilation. The requirement for RRT decreased significantly from 32% to 16% (P = 0.02). This alone is associated with a cost saving of between £15,000 and £25,000. The mean length of stay (level 3) reduced from 7.0 days to 6.0 days, which in combination with the reduction in ICU admissions saved 250 level 3 bed-days over 12 months. Finally there was a trend towards reduced ICU mortality (31% vs. 19%, P = 0.09).P478 Improvement in clinical outcomes following institution of dedicated critical care support in the high-dependency unitConclusions Implementing a critical-care-led closed unit policy in the HDU was associated with an immediate reduction in both HDU and ICU bed-days, allowing planned bed closures. There was a significant reduction in need for RRT and a trend towards reduced ICU mortality. Finally this organisational change has been carried out with significant cost savings that are likely to be sustained. Introduction Verbal orders (VOs) drug therapy refers to drug administration without prescription, usually in the context of telephone instructions from a physician at a remote location or other circumstances involving delayed prescription. In some medical care settings VOs may constitute 2 to 13% of medication orders[1]. Prescription errors associated with VOs are reputedly common[2], although some studies suggest otherwise[3]. Although prescription errors are not uncommon in critical care[4], little is known about VOs in this setting.P479Effects of a closed ICU model on a general surgical ICU K Chittawatanarat, T PamorsinlapathumMethods We prospectively audited VOs in a hardcopy-prescribing five-bed ICU setting over a period of 3 weeks, with voluntary data entry by any member of staff issuing or receiving a drug therapy VO. We collected information regarding VO timing, medication involved, clinical indication, and subsequent drug event prescription. Results Nine VOs were recorded during multiple drug interventions for 19 ICU patients in this period, with a VO event rate of 1 for every 10 ITU bed-days. All VOs were for intravenous prescription only medication, five of which were for fluid therapy to treat acute physiological deterioration. Other drugs included metoclopramide, furosemide, atracurium, and adrenaline. No VOs for opiates were recorded. Reasons for initial nonprescription included remote location, aseptic procedure, and emergency treatment. Eight prescriptions were completed within 2 hours. No VOs were recorded during overnight shifts. All grades of medical staff issued VOs. One transcription error was noted. No adverse events were noted. Conclusions Critical care VOs are not uncommon. Minimisation can be achieved by good communication, hardcopy or electronic bundle prescribing, locally agreed independent nonphysician prescribing arrangements, or drug administration in specific settings, particularly pre-prescription of fluid bolus therapy. retrospective study, outcomes of high-risk surgical patients before and after the organizational change were compared. Methods From 1990 to 2004, all surgical patients were prospectively collected in a database containing information about the type of surgery, use of the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications, and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was used on these data to develop a risk prediction model for mortality. The model consisted of the variables acute hospital admission, acute surgery, severity of surgery and age. Severity of surgery was based on a classification of surgical operations used in teaching hospitals in the Netherlands, scoring operations as one to seven points. More than three points was defined as severe. Age was divided into quartiles. Points were scored per variable. In total, six points could be scored: acute admission, acute surgery and severe surgery received one point. Age scored zero to three points. A total score of four points or more was defined as high risk. The model was validated through cross-validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.9. ICU use, morbidity and mortality before and after the change from open to closed format were retrospectively evaluated.ResultsIntroductionThe aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of setting the angle of the head of a bed to the semi-recumbent position. Ventilator-acquired pneumonias (VAPs) account for 31% of all ICU infections. Aetiology appears to be aspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal and gastric secretions around the endotracheal tube. The semi-recumbent position compared with the supine position is known to significantly reduce the incidence of VAP (8% vs. 34%)[1]. Hence the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK publishing a recommendation that ventilated patients be nursed at an angle of 30° to 45°. Methods Fifty-five members of ICU staff were asked to set the angle of the head of a standard ICU bed to 30° and 45°. The estimated bed angle was then measured accurately using a Mathey Dearman protractor. Results When estimating the head of the bed, nursing staff were the most accurate(Table 1)while other staff significantly underestimated the angle of the bed. We also found that greater experience of working in the ICU is likely to improve ability to estimate the angle of the head of bed accurately.MethodsIn a pilot study, we developed a questionnaire that consisted of 60 questions in eight domains (General satisfaction, Reception, Physical care, Mental care, Empathy and attention, Communication and information, Surroundings and Physical discomfort). Answering possibilities ranged from 1 (not satisfied) to 5 (completely satisfied). In the final study, 23 March to 29 May 2008, all consecutive adult patients from a 29-bed, tertiary-care, medical, surgical, neurosurgical and thoracic-surgical ICU were interviewed within 4 days after discharge. Demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic records. General linear modeling (GLM) with Bonferroni-Holmes correction was used to study the relationship between overall patient satisfaction scores and the eight domains, corrected for patient and ICU-related factors. The model was tested for clinically relevant interaction between determinants. Results Ninety-eight patients were interviewed. The mean overall patient satisfaction score was 4.60 (SD = 0.93). Of the eight domains, only Communication and information (P = 0.039) appeared to be significant in predicting general satisfaction. Also sex (P = 0.046), length of ICU stay (P = 0.042), the interaction between Communication and information and age (P = 0.016), and the interaction between Communication and information and Minimal Mental State Examination score (P = 0.013) were significant. An indepth analysis of Communication and information showed that the interaction of communication with birth country (P <0.0001) and with duration of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.041) was significant. This implies that, for Dutch versus non-Dutch patients and patients longer on mechanical ventilation, clear communication with doctors and nurses was particularly important. Conclusions Patient satisfaction was high in this mixed population of ICU patients. From an especially developed questionnaire, Communication and information was the most important predictor. In addition, older age, female sex, Dutch nationality, longer ICU stay, long duration of mechanical ventilation and a high Minimal Mental State Examination score were related to less satisfied patients. Here we present our experience in two emergency trials[1]. Methods We analysed the use of DPC in the Early Lactatedirected Therapy in Intensive Care Trial (NCT 00270673) and the NGAL study(TC 1405). Results In the lactate-directed therapy trial, 362 patients were randomized. In 75.4% DPC could be obtained, 3.9% of the relatives refused DPC and in 20.7% DPC could not be obtained before the end of the study (= 72 hours). In the NGAL study, 550 patients were randomized. DPC or patient consent was obtained in 89.8%, 0.7% refused DPC and in 9.4% DPC could not be obtained due to early patient death. In both studies combined, only in 2% was DPC refused and in 10% consent could not be obtained due to early patient death. Conclusions DPC is an ethically valid and practically feasible way to include patients in emergency critical care trials. Results We present three patients. Patient 1 is a 63-year-ols man with type 2 diabetes who came to the emergency department (ED) with leg pain for 2 days; he was on metformin 3 g daily. Laboratory results showed acute renal failure (ARF) and lactic acidosis (pH 6.88; lactate 23 mmol/l). Angiography imaging showed acute bilateral lower arm ischemia. Continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) was started due to ARF and acidosis(Table 1). Patient 2, a 77-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, came to the ED with vomiting and diarrhea for 3 days. He was on metformin 3 g daily. Laboratory results showed ARF, lactic acidosis (pH 6.80; lactate 18 mmol/l) and sepsis indexes (white blood cells 19.000/μl, serum procalcitonin 10.85 μg/l); due to ARF and acidosis, CVVH was started. Patient 3 is a 72-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes who came to the ED with diarrhea and vomiting for 4 days; she was on metformin 3 g daily. Laboratory results showed leucocytosis, ARF and lactic acidosis (pH 6.83; lactate 16 mmol/l).ReferenceNo signs of lactic acidosis differential diagnosis were found, so CVVH was started due to ARF and acidosis. Conclusions All three patients survived after support therapy and CVVH were started. In these cases, metformin could be the principal causal agent of acidosis or has a worsening clinical condition and accelerates acidosis development effect. Introduction Critically ill patients require high-intensity care may be at especially high risk of iatrogenic injury because they are severely ill[1]. We sought to study the incidence and nature of adverse events in the critical care setting.Methods We conducted a prospective 6-month observational study in a medicosurgical ICU. We included patients whose length of stay was >24 hours. Reporters were asked to provide the identification of the adverse events, date and time, and details with regard to the risk factors. The morbi-mortality was also recorded. Results A total of 250 patients were admitted to the ICU during an observation period, 102 were included. The incidence of adverse events was 59.8%. We found 222 adverse events (2.2 adverse events per patient). The most common adverse events as categorized by organ systems were metabolic (52%), cardiovascular, respiratory and finally infectious. Among all adverse events, only hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia were considered to be iatrogenic adverse events. No association was observed between adverse events and mortality. Conclusions We found that the incidence of adverse events was 59.8%. Some prior critical care safety studies have identified fewer adverse events than this one (3 to 37%)[2]. This difference may have occurred because methods are not standardized; important differences refer to the definitions of the concept of iatrogenic, modes of assessment (prospective, retrospective or transversal), population size, and the observation period. The high incidence of adverse events in our study is due to the exhaustive assessment of adverse events.excluded. All the drugs that were given during the ICU stay were checked for the presence of potential interactions as per the reference manual. DDIs that were detected clinically or through investigations were recorded and also any therapeutic actions taken for DDIs were noted.ResultsThe study included 400 patients ((Figure 1).Stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed: %TBSA and APACHE II score both behaved as independent predictors of mortality (P <0.0001), as did age (P = 0.002). This cohort behaves as other published data[2,3]. Conclusions Scoring systems with applicability to all critically ill patients provide a standardised objective assessment tool allowing comparison between groups, and can inform clinical decisionmaking. The strong correlation shown between APACHE II score and mortality provides evidence for the utility of APACHE II scoring in critically ill patients with burn injuries.ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that the APACHE IV system performs acceptably in our patients with severe sepsis and septic shock and can be utilized as a performance assessment tool in our population.Table 1presents the mean differences and significance level between LS and SS groups for each questionnaire (HAD components anxiety 1 and depression 2, SF-36 components physical 3 and mental 4, TSC-33). Patients who stayed >24 hours in ICU had significantly poorer scores on all scales up to 12 months post surgery, even when adjusted for baseline disease severity. Conclusions Patients who stayed in the ICU for >24 hours post cardiac surgery scored higher on several psychological evaluation questionnaires when compared with patients who stayed <24 hours. This indicates the possibility of greater psychological distress for at least 12 months after cardiac surgery.[1,2]. These new modeling tools have proven to be accurate and robust in domain applications outside the clinical setting. Moreover, classification tree models can be constructed easily by the ICU clinician and have the advantages over logistic regression to give a clear insight into the data.ReferencesMethods Three hundred and fifty-two patients with haematological malignancies that were admitted to the ICU between 1997 and 2006 for a life-threatening complication were included. Two hundred and fifty-two patient records were used for training of the models and 100 were used for validation. In a first model 12 input variables were included, and in a second more complex model 17 input variables were used for model development. These two models were consecutively constructed using Classification and Regression Tree (CART ® ), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS ® ), Random Forests (RF™) and TREENET™ software (Salford Systems, San Diego, CA, USA). Discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (±SE). All results were then compared with the results obtained by a logistic regression model.ResultsThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curves in the validation datasets for the decision tree and smoothing splines analyses were 0.744, 0.713, 0.743, and 0. was found by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire. All of the above mentioned changes were significant (P <0.0001). A stepwise multiple logistic regression identified age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.004 to 1.059; P = 0.025), length of stay (OR = 1.06 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.10; P = 0.008), length of mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.09; P = 0.017), and level of pain (OR = 8.92, 95% CI = 1.14 to 69.64; P = 0.037) and anxiety (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.08; P = 0.048) before admission to the ICU as independent predictors of worsening of quality of life 1 year after the discharge.Conclusions One year after the discharge from the ICU, patients suffered from deterioration in all aspects of quality of life evaluated by the questionnaires used. Quality of life 1 year after the discharge from intensive care was influenced by its previous level, by the age, by the length of stay and by the length of mechanical ventilation. Acknowledgement Supported by the research project MSM0021620819.P517Health-related quality of life in critically ill octogenarians: a long-term follow-up study Introduction Mortality after critical illness is higher and recovery is slower in the elderly compared with younger patients. Elderly patients recovering from critical illness may show reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL)[1]. We studied the impact of ICU stay on HRQOL of octogenarians, and compared their HRQOL with the same age-matched general population. Methods We performed a long-term prospective study in a medical-surgical ICU. Patients ≥80 years (n = 129) admitted for >48 hours were included. We used the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) to evaluate HRQOL before ICU admission (using proxies), at ICU discharge and at hospital discharge and at 3, 6 and 12 months following ICU discharge. Furthermore we compared HRQOL before ICU admission and 12 months after ICU discharge with those of an age-matched general Dutch population. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for evaluating changes between two time points. To analyze individual changes over time, a MANOVA test was used, with Wilks' lambda as the multivariate test.Results Mortality was considerable in the 129 included octogenarians. Patients could be evaluated 6 months (n = 48) and 12 months (n = 27) after ICU discharge (11 patients were lost to follow-up, 70 patients died). All SF-36 dimensions changed significantly over time (all P <0.001), with the exception of the roleemotional dimension. However, after an initial drop, HRQOL recovered to pre-ICU levels in all dimensions. The physical component scores changed significantly over time (all P <0.001), whereas the mental component scores showed only a modest decline at ICU discharge but recovered rapidly and had improved to higher than baseline values with longer follow-up to 12 months after ICU discharge. The pre-admission HRQOL in surviving octogenarians was already lower when compared with the agematched general population and remained so at 12 months after ICU discharge. Conclusions Critically ill octogenarians demonstrate a sharp decline of HRQOL during the ICU stay and a gradual improvement during the 6 months and 12 months following ICU discharge to baseline values. Recovery begins following ICU discharge to the general ward. This implies that intensive care treatment in patients ≥80 years is worthwhile. Introduction Outcome from intensive care has focused on reducing morbidity-mortality during hospitalization, but nowadays it incorporates the assessment of long-term survival and quality of life in survivors[1]. Our aim was to assess morbidity (physical and psychological) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients discharged from the ICU. Methods A longitudinal prospective and descriptive study of patients discharged from the ICU. They were interviewed at 3, 6 and 12 months at an outpatient clinic.
