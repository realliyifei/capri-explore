P693 Willingness and hesitancy to the telemedicine in patients with inflammatory bowel disease during COVID-19 outbreak. Preliminary results of a survey in an Italian IBD Center
Conclusion: In our study, APFs during CD account for almost half of all APLs.Thus, the development of local therapeutic means proves to be of necessity in order to increase the efficacy of biotherapies and to accelerate the healing of APFs.
i592Poster presentations to the initial therapeutic regimen. Complete remission was defined as closure of all initially productive fistulas, partial response was defined as closure of more than 50% of fistulas. Therapeutic failure was defined as closure of less than 50% of the initially productive fistulas. Results: 83 patients followed up for CD with APLs were collated of which 38 had APF (45.7%). The mean age was 42 years [26 -73] with a sex ratio of 0.4. Active smoking was noted in six patients (15.8%). In 55.3% of cases, PAF was present at the time of diagnosis of CD (n=21).17 patients had developed one or more PAFs during the course of their disease with a mean delay of seven years [1 -29]. APFs were associated with luminal involvement in 94.7% of cases, with ileal location in 10 patients (26.3%), colonic location in 13 patients (34.2%) and ileocolic location in 13 patients. The APFs were perianal in 34cases, vulvovaginal in five cases and gluteal in one case. There were complex fistulas in 92.1% of cases. The number of external orifices at the time of diagnosis was respectively: 1 orifice in 63.2% of cases, 2orifices in 26.3% of cases and more than two orifices in 10.5% of cases. A perineal abscess was associated in 44.7% of cases and anorectal stricture was observed in 7.9% of patients. Seton drainage was performed in 86.6% of patients. All patients with complex APF had received anti-TNFα after disappearance of collections if initially present (infliximab (92.1%), adalimumab (7.9%)) combined with thiopurines in 97.4% of cases. After a mean follow-up of 40 months, a complete remission was observed in 14 patients (36.8%), a partial response was noted in 13 patients (34.2%). 11 patients (28.9%) were in therapeutic failure.

Willingness and hesitancy to the telemedicine in patients with inflammatory bowel disease during COVID-19 outbreak. Preliminary results of a survey in an Italian IBD Center Background: Telemedicine is becoming a necessary tool for chronic disease management. Thanks to the wide diffusion of devices connecting to the World Wide Web, a large part of the population are now able to access to telemedicine services.Telemedicine is becoming a necessary tool for chronic disease management. Thanks to the wide diffusion of devices connecting to the World Wide Web, a large part of the population are now able to access to telemedicine services. The aim of this survey was to explore the willingness and hesitancy of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to the use of telemedicine during COVD-19 outbreak. Methods: A paper-and-pencil questionnaire was proposed to all consecutive patients observed at our tertiary IBD center in San Giovanni Rotondo (Italy) from February to May 2021. The survey investigated 20 items that can be grouped into 5 areas: socio-demographic data, clinical data, informatics competence, devices and network utilized for the internet connection, attitude to the telemedicine, and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

Results: A total of 156 patients completed the questionnaire (100 males). One hundred forthy-three patients (91.7%) were under 65 years and only 15 (9.6%) were graduates. Forthy-seven patients (30%) were single, 101 married (65%). Eighteen patients (11.5%) felt they had no IT skills. Eight patients (5.1%) had a previous experience of telemedicine. One hundred twenty-three patients (78.8%) consider the support of telemedicine useful for the management of their pathology and 134 (85.9%) would like the Center where they are followed up to have the possibility of offering a telemedicine service. One hundred three patients (66.0%) would like to have a teleconsultation with figures other than the Gastroenterologist. Ninety-seven patients (62.2%) agree that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has a major impact on the need to implement telemedicine. Regarding the confidence with telemedicine, 106 patients (67.9%) were partially or totally agreeing telemedicine can properly resolve health problems, and 98 (62.8%) agree that technologies guarantee the privacy of the health data. One hundred twenty-five patients (80%) agree that telemedicine should be developed independently of the pandemic, however only 48 patients (31%) believe that telemedicine guarantee the same level of assistance of visit in presence. Conclusion: Italian IBD patients showed a positive attitude towards telemedicine and consider that useful for the management of their disease. The majority of patients would like the center where they are followed up offering a telemedicine service, regardless of the ongoing pandemic. However only one third of patients believe that telemedicine can offer the same level of assistance of in-presence visit. Background: Vaccination against COVID19 prevents its severe forms and associated mortality and offers a promising action to control this pandemic. In Spain, by October 2021, 87.9% of the target population, including IBD patients had received the complete vaccination regimen. In September 2021, an additional dose of vaccine was approved in patients with immunosuppression including IBD patients on biologic agents. We evaluated the vaccination rate and additional dose willingness in this group of-at risk patients. Methods: A single-center, cross-sectional study was performed among IBD patients on biologic agents and elegibles for an additional dose of COVID19 vaccine between 19th October and 12th November 2021. Patients were identified by the list provided by the Pharmacy service. IBD clinical characteristics and type of vaccine and date of administration were checked in medical records. Acceptance and adverse effects of vaccination were evaluated after telephone or face-to-face survey in these IBD patients. Results: Out of a total of 344 patients, 269 patients (46.1% male; mean age 47±16 years; crohn´s disease n=198/ ulcerative colitis n=66/ indeterminate colitis n=5) received at least one vaccine dose and were included. The patients were on Infliximab (40.9%), Ustekinumab (29.7%), Adalimumab (20%), and Vedolizumab (8.9%). Co-treatment with immunosuppressors was used in 73.2% of patients. Only 15 (5.6%) patients refused the COVID19 vaccine: 26.7% for fear of vaccine`s adverse effects, 33.3% for doubts about a "new-design" vaccine and 40% for conviction (COVID19 pandemic denial). 46.7% of the cases would not change their opinion, but 33.3% would re-consider after discussing with their doctor and/or receiving information on the adverse effects of the vaccine. Previous to the additional dose, COVID19 vaccination was present in 94.4% of patients (n=254) (complete regimen using Pfizer 63%,Astra-Zeneca 15.4%, Moderna 12.2% and Janssen in 9.4% of patients, respectively). 42.7% of patients personally requested the appointment for initial dose of vaccination and 59.1% contacted the IBD Unit to discuss the decision to be vaccinated. Adverse effects occurred in 53.9% of the cases after the standard vaccination regimen, mainly pain in the arm (40%). Up to 94.1% of the patients agreed for an additional dose and 57.2% had already received the additional dose at the time of the assessment. Conclusion: IBD patients on biological agents and at high-risk for COVID19 accept the vaccine as well as an additional dose if recommended. Physicians in charge of IBD units should provide information and confidence in the use of the vaccine in these IBD patients. Remains to be studied the impact of the additional dose of vaccine in these patients.


## P695 Attitudes and predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease

E. Zhang* 1 , A. Gupta 1 , F.A. Macrae 1 , B. Christensen 1 1 Royal Melbourne Hospital, Gastroenterology, Melbourne, Australia

Background: Vaccination has proven to be an effective public health measure to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, vaccine "hesitancy" has limited uptake in some populations. We surveyed individuals with IBD to explore factors associated with vaccine uptake, concerns, and which sources of information were considered trustworthy surrounding vaccination. Methods: Patients with IBD were recruited from a specialist IBD clinic at a tertiary hospital in Australia, and through a national IBD patient society (Crohn's & Colitis Australia). Patients were invited to complete an anonymous survey between 31 October -17 November 2021. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with vaccine uptake. Data was analysed using SPSS (Chicago, IL). Results: There were a total of 441 respondents. Demographic and IBD characteristics are presented in Table 1. Most respondents 411 (93.2%) had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccination. Among 30 (6.8%) respondents who had not been vaccinated, concern about experiencing an IBD flare with vaccination and vaccine safety were most commonly identified. Of those who had not yet been vaccinated, the possibility of getting vaccinated in the future was likely in 3 (10.7%), unlikely in 12 (42.8%), whilst 13 (45.4%) were unsure about future vaccination. Multivariate analysis [ Table 2] demonstrated past influenza vaccination (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.34-8.9, p = 0.009) and self-perceived risk of being more unwell with COVID-19 infection due to IBD was positively associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake (OR 5.25, 95% CI 1.96-14.04, p <0.001). Most agreed that that vaccination in general was safe 306 (90.1%). The perceived risk of COVID-19 vaccination causing an IBD flare, and concern that vaccination is unsafe in pregnancy were both negatively associated with vaccine uptake (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.77, p = 0.01 and OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.65, p = 0.006) respectively. Trust in healthcare workers was high with 282 (73.7%) responders ranking them the most trusted source to obtain information surrounding vaccination [ Figure 1]. Social media was ranked the least trusted source of information by 225 (58.6%).


## Conclusion:

Past influenza vaccination and self-perceived risk of being more unwell with COVID-19 due to IBD, were positive predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake in IBD patients. Concerns about an IBD flare with vaccination is a unique consideration in those vaccine hesitant and is a negative predictor of vaccine uptake. Among those not yet vaccinated, 45% were uncertain about future vaccination. Given healthcare providers were ranked the most trusted source surrounding this domain, this survey highlights the key role they have in exploring vaccination concerns and misconceptions in IBD patients

Concerns about an IBD flare with vaccination is a unique consideration in those vaccine hesitant and is a negative predictor of vaccine uptake. Among those not yet vaccinated, 45% were uncertain about future vaccination. Given healthcare providers were ranked the most trusted source surrounding this domain, this survey highlights the key role they have in exploring vaccination concerns and misconceptions in IBD patients
