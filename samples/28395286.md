Furthermore, with plastic surgery being such a highly competitive field, the group of candidates available to apply to fellowship programs are already a select group. [1][2][3] It is therefore important to understand what sets candidates apart from a crowd of qualified peers.

This study aims to provide information on the criteria that are used to select and rank applicants for the microsurgery fellowship match. With these data available, both applying residents and fellowship directors can be better informed as to which aspects of an application are most valuable.


## Methods

A 38-question web-based survey was created using Ques-tionPro Survey Software (San Francisco, CA) and sent by email in April 2015 to all microsurgery fellowship directors (n ¼ 36) involved in the San Francisco Match program at the time. To maximize participation, follow-up e-mails were sent at the 2-, 4-, and 6-week points to individuals who did not complete the survey initially.

The survey investigated the fellowship directors' perceived importance of a variety of factors used for selection and ranking of applicants, and included quantitative considerations such as exam performance, as well as qualitative aspects such as interaction with faculty and staff during interview. The survey was divided into influential and controversial factors. The 33 influential factors were further divided into five sections, including medical school, residency training, research experience, interview performance, and other candidate characteristics. All influential factors were evaluated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being "not at all important in making the decision and 5 being "essential to making the decision."

The remaining five factors of the survey were controversial factors, which may have a negative impact in evaluating a candidate. These factors were graded on a separate Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being "very negative impact in making the decision" and 5 being "very positive impact in making the decision."

Responses to the survey were collected and processed using Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Washington), and analyzed using IBM SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York).


## Results

Nineteen out of 36 of the microsurgery fellowship directors responded for a total response rate of 53%.

Overall, the most important factors included letters of recommendations by microsurgeons (4.6 AE 0.5), interactions with faculty (4.6 AE 0.5), overall interview performance in the selection process (4.6 AE 0.5), professionalism and ethics (4.4 AE 0.7), and interpersonal skills (4.4 AE 0.6).

Conversely, the least important factors were PhD or equivalent (1.7 AE 0.9), MPH, MBA, MS or equivalent (1.8 AE 0.6), USMLE/COMLEX Step 3 score (2.1 AE 1.0), prior research fellowship (2.1 AE 0.9), and doing an audition elective/rotation (2.1 AE 1.0).

All of the controversial factors had a negative impact on the selection of the candidates: graduate from a nonplastic surgery residency program (2.1 AE 0.9), graduate needing a visa (2.3 AE 0.8), graduate from a foreign medical school (2.4 AE 0.8), graduate of non-U.S. plastic surgery residency program (2.4 AE 1.0), and candidate plans to practice in the same city as the fellowship (2.8 AE 0.7).

Categorically, the most important group of factors were those related to the interview process with a combined weighted Likert scale average of 4.2 (►Fig. 1). Each factor was unilaterally ranked as important with the only outlier being demonstrated leadership qualities, which with a score of 3.5 AE 0.8 still remains on the positive end of the spectrum. The least important overall category was the medical school factors with a 2.4 average score. Slightly more preference was given to the quality of the medical school attended (2.9 AE 0.8) rather than the actual performance in medical school or on USMLEs. Both the residency and research categories displayed a wide spread of perceived importance, with preference for letters of recommendation and performed clinical research, as opposed to the lack of value for board scores and additional degrees. A summary of the results is shown in ►Table 1 and ►Fig. 1.


## Discussion

For competitive fields, it becomes increasingly important to define exactly the criteria that predict success. This information was previously unavailable for the microsurgery fellowship. By understanding what microsurgery fellowship directors view as essential in fellows, applicants can better tailor their focus to display their potential. Additionally, microsurgery fellowship directors themselves can appreciate knowing the opinion of their peers and compare their selection criteria to other programs nationwide. The initial inclination would be to assume that highly competitive fellowship programs require applicants to focus more heavily on quantitative measures and research. However, it is the qualitative measures such as interview and communication skills, which distinguish applicants from the pool. [1][2][3][4]10 This may be because at a high enough level of competitiveness, all applicants are assumed to have exemplary exam scores and extensive research experience.

As the pool of applicants is repeatedly selected to be uniformly excellent quantitatively, the relative importance of interview performance increases. This pattern is borne out both by research into other fellowships' selection criteria and our own results, which show that exam scores and medical school performance were not essential. [5][6][7][8] Indeed, all the factors marked as being the most essential were either part of the interview process or related to letters of recommendation. As Rod Rohrich points out in reference to plastic surgery residency applicants, examination score may be an indicator of one's abilities but they pale in comparison to personal interaction. 11 Interestingly, the relative lack of importance of exam scores is farther reaching than just those acquired in medical school, also applying to the more recent USMLE Step 3 and in-service exam scores. The latter is the highest ranked and still only scores 2.7 AE 1.0. While Step 3 and in-service exams are less far removed than medical school assessments (e.g., Step 1 or 2CK), they may remain similarly unimportant due to lack of representation of an applicant's actual surgical skills and work ethics. In lieu of observing an applicant operate, fellowship program directors have to rely on the expert opinion and words of those surgeons who write the applicants' letters of recommendations.

Equally as important as aspects of the interview are letters of recommendation from microsurgeons. In addition to serving as a surrogate for assessing surgical skill and work ethics, emphasis placed on letters of recommendation stems from the fact that microsurgery is a small, connected community. Any enthusiastic letter of recommendation speaks to a candidate's clinical competence and real-world ability, but in a small community such as microsurgery, it also carries the weight of a personal acquaintance. Fellowship directors can place a higher level of trust in the opinion of a colleague whom they know or who is well known. Again, the most important factors are not scores on paper, but the aspects of a candidate's application that speak to personal character in a more holistic and better informed manner.

In light of the fact that microsurgery fellowship directors considered both microsurgery-specific and general clinical research experience important to their decision, it is surprising that the two postgraduate research degree categories were marked as the least important factors. However, as much as it seems that these two sets of factors should be more closely aligned, their discrepancy has been shown in other fellowships as well. 5,7 The lack of interest shown toward associated degrees may point toward a trend of not valuing an individual's academic predisposition, as a fellowship is a clinical endeavor. Dedicated research degrees do not reflect a candidate's current surgical skills or personal work ethics-elements crucial for a successful microsurgeon and reflected in the essential factors of the survey.

Most survey's controversial questions dealt with international applicants, who have been shown to have a lower match rate for U.S. residency programs. 1,12 It is not surprising then that this disadvantage continues for fellowship, though these data are not usually collected for fellowship director surveys, and thus is novel. Although all the controversial factors have a negative impact, the most negative of them was graduating for a nonplastic surgery residency program. Thus, even though there are multiple routes to a microsurgery, including plastic surgery, ENT (ear-nose-throat), and OMFS (oral and maxillofacial surgery), the preferred route, as shown by negative impact of the others, is plastic surgery.

It is important to note that while the relative importance of different factors can be derived by comparing the aggregate of how essential director perceived them to be, individual fellowship directors did not rank these factors in order of importance. Further research is needed to identify the criteria of successful applicants, and the influence these criteria have on the first choice on the applicants' rank list.  In conclusion, this study provides evidence on which aspects of microsurgery applications fellowship directors perceive to be most important: letters of recommendation, interactions with faculty, and interview performance. The focus on these aspects in fellowship rather than residency reflects the mentor relationships that define fellowship. During fellowship a young surgeon refines the required skills for a bright career, meaning getting along at both a professional and personal levels can be equally important. Furthermore, fellows often work with a more confined group of attendings and with more frequency within this smaller group. We hope that fellowship directors, residency programs, and applicants find these data useful as they prepare for and participate in the microsurgery fellowship match.
