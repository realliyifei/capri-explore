Non-linear bias measurements require a great level of control of potential systematic effects in galaxy redshift surveys. Our goal is to demonstrate the viability of using Counts-in-Cells (CiC), a statistical measure of the galaxy distribution, as a competitive method to determine linear and higher-order galaxy bias and assess clustering systematics. We measure the galaxy bias by comparing the first four moments of the galaxy density distribution with those of the dark matter distribution. We use data from the MICE simulation to evaluate the performance of this method, and subsequently perform measurements on the public Science Verification (SV) data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find that the linear bias obtained with CiC is consistent with measurements of the bias performed using galaxy-galaxy clustering, galaxygalaxy lensing, CMB lensing, and shear+clustering measurements. Furthermore, we compute the projected (2D) non-linear bias using the expansion δ g = 3 k=0 (b k /k!)δ k , finding a non-zero value for b 2 at the 3σ level. We also check a non-local bias model and show that the linear bias measurements are robust to the addition of new parameters. We compare our 2D results to the 3D prediction and find compatibility in the large scale regime (> 30 Mpc h −1 ).

# INTRODUCTION

In recent years, photometric redshift galaxy surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (Kollmeier et al. 2017), the Dark Energy Survey (DES) (Dark Energy Sur-Email:ana.salvador@uam.es † Email:francs1@uci.edu vey Collaboration et al. 2016), and the future Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) (Ivezić et al. 2008) and Euclid (Amiaux et al. 2012), have arisen as powerful probes of the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the universe and of dark energy. The main advantage of these surveys is their ability to retrieve information from a vast number of objects, yielding unprecedented statistics for different observables in the study of LSS. Their biggest drawback is the lack of line-of-sight precision and the systematic effects associated with it. Thus, well constrained systematic effects and robust observables are required in order to maximize the performance of such surveys. In this context, simple observables such as the galaxy number counts serve an important role in proving the robustness of a survey. In particular, the galaxy Counts-in-Cells (CiC), a method that consists of counting the number of galaxies in a given three-dimensional or angular aperture, has been shown to provide valuable information about the LSS (Peebles 1980;Gaztañaga 1994;Bernardeau 1994) and gives an estimate of how different systematic effects can affect measurements. CiC can provide insights to higher-order statistical moments of the galaxy counts without requiring the computation resources of other methods (Gil-Marín et al. 2015), such as the three-or four-point correlation functions. Understanding the relation between galaxies and matter (galaxy bias) is essential for the measurements of cosmological parameters (Gaztanaga et al. 2011). The uncertainties in this relation strongly increase the errors in the dark energy equation of state or gravitational growth index (Eriksen & Gaztanaga 2015). Thus, having a wide variety of complementary methods to determine galaxy biasing can help break degeneracies and improve the overall sensitivity for a given galaxy survey. In this paper we present a method to extract information from the galaxy CiC. Using this method, we measure the projected (angular) galaxy bias (linear and non-linear) in both simulations and observational data from DES, we compare the measured and predicted linear and non-linear bias, and we test for the presence of systematic effects. This dataset is ideal for this study since it has been already used for CiC in Clerkin et al. (2016) where the authors found that the galaxy density distribution and the weak lensing convergence (κW L) are well described by a lognormal distribution. The main difference between our study and Clerkin et al. (2016) is that our main goal is to provide a measurement of the galaxy bias, whereas Clerkin et al. (2016) study convergence maps. The authors in Gruen et al. (2017) also perform CiC in DES data. Combining gravitational lensing information and CiC, they measure the galaxy density probability distribution function (PDF) and obtain cosmological constraints using the redMaGiC selected galaxies (Rozo et al. 2016) in DES Y1A1 photometric data (Drlica-Wagner et al. 2018). In our case we measure the moments of the galaxy density contrast PDF and compare them to the matter density contrast PDF from simulations (with the same redshift distributions) to study different biasing models, in a different galaxy sample (DES-SV). Throughout the paper, we assume a fiducial flat ΛCDM+ν (one massive neutrino) cosmological model based on Planck 2013 + WMAP polarization + ACT/SPT + BAO, with parameters (Ade et al. 2014) ω b = 0.0222, ωc = 0.119, ων = 0.00064, h = 0.678, τ = 0.0952, ns = 0.961 and As = 2.21 × 10 −9 at a pivot scale k = 0.05Mpc −1 (yielding σ8 = 0.829 at z = 0), where h ≡ H0/100km s −1 Mpc −1 and ωi ≡ Ωih 2 for each species i. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the data sample used for our analysis. First, we present the simulations used to test and validate the method and afterwards, the dataset in which we perform our measurements.

In Section 3, we present the CiC theoretical framework and detail our method to obtain the linear and non-linear bias. Section 4 and 5 present the CiC moments and bias calculations for the MICE simulation and DES-SV dataset, respectively. In Section 6, we study the systematic uncertainties in our method. Finally, in Section 7, we include some concluding remarks about this work.


# DATA SAMPLE


## Simulations

In order to test and validate the methodology presented in this paper, we use the MICE simulation (Fosalba et al. 2008;Crocce et al. 2010). MICE is an N-body simulation with cosmological parameters following a flat ΛCDM model with Ωm = 0.25, ΩΛ = 0.75, Ω b = 0.044, ns = 0.95, and σ8 = 0.8. The simulation covers an octant of the sky, with redshift z, between 0 and 1.4 and contains 55 million galaxies in the lightcone. The simulation has a comoving size L box = 3072h −1 Mpc and more than 8 · 10 9 particles (Crocce et al. 2015). The galaxies in the MICE simulation are selected following the procedure in Crocce et al. (2016), imposing the threshold i evol < 22.5. The MICE simulation has been extensively studied in the literature (Sánchez et al. 2011;Crocce et al. 2016;Hoffmann et al. 2015;Pujol et al. 2017;Garcia-Fernandez et al. 2018), including measurements of the higher-order moments in the dark matter field (Fosalba et al. 2008), providing an ideal validation sample.


## The DES SV Benchmark Data Sample

In this paper we perform measurements of the density contrast distribution and its moments on the DES Science Verification (SV) photometric sample 1 (Figure 1). The DES Science Verification observations were taken using DECam on the Blanco 4m Telescope near La Serena, Chile, covering over 250 deg 2 at close to DES nominal depth. From this sample we make selection cuts in order to recover the LSS Benchmark sample . By doing this we minimize the possible two-point systematic effects and we ensure completeness. We focus on the SPT-E field, since it is the largest contiguous field and the best analyzed, with 60 • < RA < 95 • , and −60 • < Dec < −40 • considering only objects with 18 < i < 22.5 where i is MAG AUTO as measured by SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) in the i-band. The star-galaxy separation is performed by selecting objects such that WAVG SPREAD MODEL > 0.003. The total area considered for our study is then 116.2 deg 2 with approximately 2.3 million objects and a number density ng = 5.6 arcmin −2 . Several photo-z estimates are available for these data. We will focus on the TPZ catalog  and use the same 5 redshift bins used in Crocce et al. (2016) with the redshift distribution depicted in Figure 2. Several measurements of the linear bias have been performed using this field Giannantonio et al. 2016;Prat et al. 2018), making it ideal for this study.  


# THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY


## Counts-in-cells

Counts-in-Cells (Peebles 1980) is a method used to analyze the LSS and is based on dividing a galaxy survey into cells of equal volume (Vpix) and counting the number of galaxies in each cell, (N gal ). It is particularly useful to work with the density contrast, δi in each pixel, i, defined as:
δi ≡ ρi ρ − 1 (1) where ρi ≡ N i,gal V i,pix
is galaxy density in the pixel and ρ is the mean density. Given this definition, it follows that δ = 0. The information that we are interested in is encoded in the statistical moments of the density contrast distribution:
mj>1 ≡ δ j = 1 Npix i (δi − δ ) j (2)
where Npix is the number of pixels inside the survey. The connected moments of the smoothed density field are the average of the J-point correlation functions in a cell of volume V (Gaztañaga 1994):
ξ J (V ) ≡ δ J ≡ ≡ 1 V J ... d 3 r1...d 3 rJ ξJ (r1, ..., rJ )W (r1)...W (rJ ) (3)
with W (rJ ) window functions. Averaging over spheres of radius R, the rescaled connected moments SJ can be defined as:
SJ (R) ≡ ξ J (R) [ξ 2 (R)] J−1 , J > 2 (4) With S2(R) =ξ2(R).
In practice, what we measure are the central moments mJ of the angular counts. But because we ultimately want to obtain the connected moments, we need to subtract the lower order contributions. Due to the discreteness of CiC statistics, we also have to take into account the shot noise δSN. We assume that the galaxies and the matter density field follow a Poissonian distribution and compute the shot-noise corrections and connected moments that can be found in Appendix A. These definitions can easily be generalized for angular aperture cells. This kind of cell is more suitable for photometric redshift galaxy surveys like DES given the relative lack of precision in the determination of distances along the line-of-sight compared to spectroscopic surveys. For the area-averaged angular correlations wJ (θ) :
SJ ≡ wJ (θ) [w2(θ)] J−1 , J > 2(5)
In the angular case the moments are the average of the J-point angular correlation functions in a cell of area A (Gaztañaga 1994):
wJ (θ) = 1 A J A dA1...dAJ wJ (θ1, ..., θJ )(6)
To obtain the second order moment, S2(θ), we can integrate the angular two point correlation function w2(θ):
w2(θ) = dz1 dz2 φ(z1)φ(z2)ξ(r(z1, z2))(7)
where θ = arccos(Ω1 · Ω2) is the cell aperture, φ(z) is the redshift distribution of the sample, and ξ(r(z1, z2)) the correlation function. Integrating over one pixel:
w2(θ) = 1 A 2 pix w2(θ)dΩ1dΩ2(8)
In most previous studies, the cells considered were spheres with radii of varying apertures (Peebles (1980), Bernardeau (1994)). We perform our measurements of the projected (angular) density contrast by dividing the celestial sphere into HEALpix pixels (Górski et al. 2005). For our study we vary the HEALPix parameter N side from 32 to 4096 (i.e. apertures ranging from 1.83 • to 0.014 • ). The angular aperture, θ, is estimated as the square root of the pixel area. According to equation (3) there is a dependence on the boundaries of the cell and thus on the shape that we choose for the pixels. In Gaztañaga (1994), the authors estimate CiC for square cells of side l in a range l = 0.03 • − 20 • and compare to the average correlation functions w2(θ). The agreement between the two estimates indicates that square cells give very similar results to circular cells when the sizes of the cells are scaled to θ = l/ √ π. Using data from MICE, we perform several tests to see that the concrete shape of the pixel, when it is close to a regular polygon, does not affect the measured moments despite boundary effects (Appendix B). Furthermore, when working with the acquired observational data, the geometry of the survey becomes complicated. A discussion of how we deal with this is found in Appendix C. The error bars throughout this paper, are estimated using the bootstrap method (Efron 1979;Ivezić et al. 2014). This choice is mainly due to the lack of number of samples for large pixel sizes that might limit the precision of other methods such as jack-knife, given that the latter depends highly on the number of samples as pointed out in (Norberg et al. 2009). Figure 3 shows agreement between the uncertainties computed using the jackknife and bootstrap methods for a randomly chosen redshift bin in the MICE simulation.


## Galaxy bias

One of the most important applications of the CiC observable is the determination of the galaxy bias. We observe the galaxy distribution and use it as a proxy to the underlying matter distribution. Both baryons and dark matter structures grow around primordial overdensities via gravitational interaction, so these distributions should be highly correlated. This relationship is called the galaxy bias, which measures how well galaxies trace the dark matter. Galaxy biasing was seen for the first time analyzing the clustering of different populations of galaxies (Davis et al. 1978;Dressler 1980). The theoretical relation between galaxy and mass distributions was suggested by Kaiser (1984) and developed by Bardeen et al. (1986). Since then, many different prescriptions have arisen (Fry & Gaztañaga 1993;Bernardeau 1996;Mo & White 1996;Sheth & Tormen 1999;Manera et al. 2010;Manera & Gaztañaga 2011). However, there is no generally accepted framework for galaxy biasing. While the galaxy and dark matter distribution are related, the exact relation depends on galaxy formation (Press & Schechter 1974), galaxy evolution (Nusser & Davis 1994;Tegmark & Peebles 1998;Blanton et al. 2000), and selection effects. Bias depends strongly on the environment. Using dark matter simulations, the authors in Pujol et al. (2017) show how the halo bias is determined by local density and not by halo mass. Several studies have demonstrated the different behaviors of early-type and late-type galaxies at both small and large scales (Ross et al. 2006;Willmer et al. 1999;Zehavi et al. 2002;Norberg et al. 2002). To have a good estimate of the real matter distribution, it is convenient to use a galaxy sample as homogeneous as possible. With the linear bias b(z) approximation, we can relate the matter fluctuations δm with the fluctuations in the galaxy distribution δg:
δg = bδm(9)
In the linear approximation, up to scalings, all statistical properties are preserved by the biasing and the observed galaxy properties reflect the matter distribution on large scales, as long as we consider only two-point statistics. However, in the general case, it is highly unlikely that the relation is both local and linear. Non-local dependencies might come from some properties such as the local velocity field or derivatives of the local gravitational potential (Fry & Gaztañaga 1993;Scherrer & Weinberg 1998). Bias also depends on redshift (Fry 1996;Tegmark & Peebles 1998). When non-Gaussianities are taken into account, linear bias fails to be a good description. If we want to measure higher orders we can assume that the (smoothed) galaxy density can be written as a function of the mass density and expand it as a Taylor series (assuming a local relation) (Frieman & Gaztañaga 1999;Fry & Gaztañaga 1993):
δg = f (δ) = ∞ k=0 b k k! δ k m(10)
The linear term b1 = b is the usual linear bias. Using this expansion we can relate the dark matter and the galaxy density contrast moments using the following relationships (Fry & Gaztañaga 1993):
S2 = b 2 S2m (11) S3 = b −1 (S3m + 3c2) (12) S4 = b −2 (S4m + 12c2S3m + 4c3 + 12c 2 2 )(13)
where c k = b k /b for k 2. We will refer to this model as local.

The authors in Bel et al. (2015) point out that ignoring the contribution from the non-local bias can affect the linear and non-linear bias results. As a consequence, we analyze the case when the non-local contribution is included. To do so, we substitute c2 by c 2 = c2 − 2 3 γ2, where γ2 is the so-called non-local bias parameter . We will refer to this model as non-local.

Note that we omit the terms higher than 3rd order because, as we will show later, we have very limited sensitivity to b3, and expect to have no sensitivity to b4.


## Estimating the projected linear and non-linear bias

The relations in equations (11-13) refer to the threedimensional case and connect an observed galaxy distribution with its underlying dark matter distribution, both tracing the same redshift range and cosmological parameters. We assume that this bias model is also valid for the projected moments (we will check the validity of this assumption later). Moreover, given the measurements in a dark matter simulation with the same redshift distribution and angular footprint as our galaxy dataset, we estimate the linear and non-linear bias of these galaxies using equations (11-13). Note that these relations apply when we are comparing two datasets with the same value for σ8 parameter. In the case that σ8 = σ8,m we will have to correct the resulting bias so, bcorr = buncorr σ8,m σ8 .

We will use this correction in Section 6.3. We also take advantage of the fact that the skewness and kurtosis depend weakly with the cosmological parameters (Bouchet et al. 1992). In particular, a 5% variation choosing Ωm = 0.25 translates to a variation of 0.2% in the measured S3m, which is much smaller than the statistical fluctuations that we expect from our samples. In the case of S4m our sensitivity is even lower, making it safe to use a simulation with the same footprint and redshift distribution, as long as the variation in the cosmological parameters is small. However, this is not necessarily true for the case of S2m, where the dependency on the cosmological parameters is higher. We check this using equation (8) to compute the projected S2m for two different sets of cosmological parameters: our fiducial Planck cosmology (Ade et al. 2014) and a model with Ωm = 0.2. We use a Gaussian selection function φ(z) with σz = 0.05(1 + z) since this is representative of the datasets that we analyze in this work. After this, we check the ratio:
δpij(z, θ) = S2m,i(z, θ) S2m,j(z, θ) D 2 +,j (z) D 2 +,i (z)(15)
for the different redshift slices considered in our analysis, where the subscripts i and j correspond to two different sets of cosmological parameters and D+(z) is the linear growth factor (Peebles 1980;Heath 1977) evaluated at the mean redshift of the considered slice. This gives us an upper limit to the expected variation in S2m to consider in our analysis.

In Figure 4 we can see that the variation is within 12% of the linear prediction, thus, we conservatively assign 12%

systematic error to S2m due to this variation. Under these conditions we perform a simultaneous fit to b, b2, b3 and γ2.

In order to do so, we consider the likelihood:
log L = − 1 2 4 k=2 i,j [S k,g (θi) − S k,mod (θi)] C −1 k,ij [S k,g (θj) − S k,mod (θj)] = − χ 2 2(16)
where S k,g are the measured galaxy moments and S k,mod are the models in equations (11), (12), and (13). We checked that the measured S k follow a Gaussian distribution. The covariances C k,ij are computed as follows:
C k,ij = Nu,pix(θi) Nu,pix(θj) 2 2(j−i) σ k (θi)σ k (θj)(17)
with Nu,pix(θi) being the number of pixels used in an aperture, θi. Note that, since we are using HEALPix, and we are not displacing the field, we are re-using the same galaxies for different scales, so the factor
N u,pix (θ i ) N u,pix (θ j ) 2 2(j−i)
accounts for the induced correlation due this reuse. We assume that the errors in the dark matter moments and the errors in the galaxy moments are not correlated and add them in quadrature, so:
σ k (θi) = σ 2 k,gal (θi) + σ 2 k,m (θi)(18)
where σ k,gal/m (θi) is the standard deviation of the k-th (galaxy or matter) moment in an aperture θi computed using bootstrapping. We use the following flat priors:

• 0 < b < 10.

• −10 < b2 < 10.

• −10 < b3 < 10.

• γ2 = 0 (or in the case of non-local model −10 < γ2 < 10).

These priors have been chosen to prevent unphysical results. We evaluate the likelihood and obtain the best fit values and their uncertainties by performing a MCMC using the software package emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). Summarizing, the method works as follows:

(i) Measure CiC moments using HEALPix pixels in the galaxy sample.

(ii) Measure CiC moments using the same pixels and selection function in a dark matter simulation with comparable cosmological parameters.

(iii) Evaluate statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measured moments.

(iv) Obtain best fit b, b2, b3, (and γ2 in the non-local model) using MCMC with the models from equations (11-13).

In summary, in the local model we fit 3 free parameters, whereas in the non-local model we fit 4.

In Hoffmann et al. (2015), the authors present a prediction for the non-linear bias as a function of the linear bias in the three-dimensional case:
b2 = b 2 − 2.45b + 1.03 (19) b3 = b 3 − 7.32b 2 + 10.79b − 3.90(20)
We will use these predictions to test the compatibility between the 3D and the measured projected values for the non-linear bias.


# RESULTS IN SIMULATIONS

In order to validate this method, we first compute the CiC moments in the MICE simulation (in both galaxies and DM) using a Gaussian selection function φ(z) with σz = 0.05(1 + z). This σz is similar to the photometric redshifts found in the data using TPZ (Carrasco Kind & Brunner 2013) and BPZ (Benitez 2000  ). Then we do the same with the SV data sample presented in Section 2.2 with TPZ photometric redshifts. Figure 5 shows the moments of the density contrast distribution as a function of the cell scale for the different photometric redshift bins. We observe that the moments follow the expected trend, that is, lower redshift bins have higher values for the higher-order moments since non-linear gravitational collapse has a larger effect on these. This is true for all measurements except for the last two redshift bins of the variance, S2. This can be due to the magnitude cuts, since the galaxy populations are different at different redshifts. We also see that the larger the cell scale, the smaller the variance S2, since larger cell scales should be more homogeneous. The skewness and the kurtosis in linear scales (θ > 0.1 • ) are constant and of the same order of magnitude as the expected values (S3 ≈ 34/7, S4 ≈ 60712/1323) (Bernardeau 1994). The behavior at non-linear scales is due to the non-linearities of the MICE simulation.


## Angular moments for MICE


## Projected galaxy bias in MICE simulation

We smear the true redshift with the proper selection function in the MICE dark matter field, obtained from a dilution of the dark matter particles (taking 1/700 of the parti- cles). The authors in Chang et al. (2016) demonstrate that the dilution of the dark matter field does not impact their statistics and using the measured moments from the previous section we proceed to perform a simultaneous fit for b, b2, and b3 using the local, non-linear bias model from equations (11,12,13). The fit results are summarized in Figure  6. We can see the impact of changing the range of θ considered in the fit. In this case we see that including scales smaller than 0.1 • , where non-linear clustering has a large impact, affects the b2 results. This, together with the fact that the reduced χ 2 minimum value doubles when including θ = 0.05 • clearly shows that we should not consider scales smaller than θ = 0.1 • . We can see as well that b3 is compatible with zero and that we have a limited sensitivity to it, given the area used. Thus, the choice of ignoring terms of orders higher than b3 becomes a good approximation. However, for b2 we are able to measure a significant non-zero contribution. We can also see that the predicted values for the 3D non-linear bias parameter b2 are not in good agreement at small scales, while there is an indication of better agreement at larger scales. This suggests that the 2D and 3D values for b2 might be compatible at larger scales, in agreement with Manera & Gaztañaga (2011)   and b2 vary with the scale and converge to a constant value around R > 30 − 60 Mpc/h, which means that the values that we measure here have not yet fully converged. The prediction for b3 seems to be compatible with the estimated values given the size of the error bars. These results show that we should consider b2 as a first order (small) correction to the linear bias model at these scales for projected (angular) measurements. The individual fits can be seen in Appendix D.
θ ∈ (0.22 • , 0.92 • ) θ ∈ (0.11 • , 0.92 • ) θ ∈ (0.05 • , 0.92 • ) θ ∈ (0.11 • , 0.46 • )z

## Verification and biasing model comparison

In order to verify this method and check if the local nonlinear model considered induces certain systematic biases on the results, we check that the measured linear bias is compatible with corresponding measurements from the two point correlation function (Figure 7). In particular, we use b best (z) = 0.98 + 1.24z − 1.72z 2 + 1.28z 3

In Figure 7, we can see that the local and non-local bias are in agreement, most likely due to the scale range that we are dealing with and the projection effects due to the size of the redshift slices. We can also see that the simplest model (local) has the lowest reduced chi square.


# RESULTS IN DES-SV DATA


## Angular moments for DES -SV

Using the same footprint, selection cuts, and redshift bins as in Crocce et al. (2016), we compute the moments of the density contrast distribution for the SV data. These results are depicted in Figure 8  to the different way non-linearities are induced in the simulation and in real data. We also compare to the results from CFHTLS found in Wolk et al. (2013). We find a similar general behavior, as well as the same order of magnitude in the measured S3 and S4. However, we do not expect the same exact results since the redshift distributions from CFHTLS do not match exactly the corresponding distributions in the DES-SV data.


## Projected galaxy bias in DES -SV

Repeating the procedure that we used for the MICE galaxy simulation, we analyze the DES -SV data and the MICE dark matter simulation, and compare their moments. In Figure 9 we can see the results of simultaneously fitting for b, b2 and b3. The measurements in this figure include the systematic uncertainties are introduced in Section 6. The resulting b is corrected by the ratio of σ8 between MICE and our adopted fiducial cosmology using equation (14). The fit results can be seen in Figure D2. In this case, we detect a non-zero value for b2. We check the probability of b2 being zero by computing:
χ 2 z = i,j=1,N zbinsb 2,iC −1 2,ij (z)b2,j(22)
The sum runs for all the redshift bins.b2 is the weighted average of the fit results with the different fitting ranges and C2,ij(z) is the covariance matrix for b2. Taking into account the correlations between different redshift bins:
C2,ij(z) = NijNji NiiNjj ∆b2,i∆b2,j(23)
with Nij is the number of galaxies observed in the photo-z bin i from the true-z bin j and ∆b2,i is the weighted uncertainty inb2,i for the photo-z bin i.

the local model. However, we lack the sensitivity necessary to detect a non-zero b3.

We also check the measurement of linear bias obtained in this work and compare it with previous measurements on the same dataset Figure 10. The measurements are generally in good agreement with each other showing the robustness of the method. Future DES data will have a considerably larger area and, as previous MICE measurements show, these measurements will improve. Here we also use the skewness and the kurtosis of dark matter from the MICE dark matter simulation, as those quantities hardly depend on the cosmology (Bouchet et al. 1992). We also find that our results are similar to those in Ross et al. (2006). We do not expect them to be equal as the samples are different and the bias depends strongly on the population sample.


# SYSTEMATIC ERRORS

In this section, we explore the effects that several potential sources of systematic uncertainty have on our moment measurements. Since our main observable is related to the number of galaxy-counts in a given redshift interval, we are interested in observational effects that can affect this number. The main potential sources of systematic uncertainties are changes in airmass, seeing, sky brightness, star-galaxy separation, galactic extinction, and the possible errors in the determination of the photometric redshift. In order to evaluate their effects, we use the maps introduced in Leistedt et al. (2016). To account for the stellar abundance in our field we proceed as in Crocce et al. (2016) and use the USNO-B1 catalog (Monet et al. 2003). We also use the SFD dust maps (Schlegel et al. 1998). What follows is a detailed step-by-step guide to our systematic analysis: we select one of the aforementioned maps and locate the pixels where the value of the systematic is below the percentile level t. We compute the moments of the density contrast distribution in these pixels and their respective errors using bootstrap. We change the threshold to t + 5, repeat the process, and evaluate the difference between the moments calculated using this threshold divided by the moments in the original footprint ∆Si(t)/ Si . An example of the results of this procedure can be found in Figure 11. We consider that a systematic effect is present if the average of ∆Si(t)/ Si is different from zero at a 2σ confidence level or above for the different values of t from the 50th tile to the 100th tile. Then, we assign a systematic uncertainty equal to the value of this average. To be conservative, we consider these effects as independent, so we add them in quadrature. We summarize the main systematic effects observed in each redshift bin of our sample:

• Bin 0.2 < z < 0.4:

-Seeing in i-band: we assign a 3% systematic uncertainty in S4.

-Seeing in z-band: we assign a 2.5% systematic uncertainty in S4.

-Sky-brightness r-band: we assign a 1% systematic uncertainty in S4.

-Sky-brightness i-band: we assign a 1% systematic uncertainty in S4.

-Airmass in g-band: we assign a 1% uncertainty in S4.

-Airmass in r-band: we assign a 1% uncertainty in S4.

-Airmass in i-band: we assign a 1% uncertainty in S4.

-USNO-B stars: We assign a 4% uncertainty to S2, 7% uncertainty to S3, and 9% to S4.

• Bin 0.4 < z < 0.6: -Seeing in z-band: We assign a 1.5% uncertainty to S4.

-USNO-B stars: We assign a 4% uncertainty to S2, 3% uncertainty to S3, and 4% to S4.

• Bin 0.6 < z < 0.8: -Seeing in g-band: We assign a 2% to S4.

-Seeing in r-band: We assign a 2% to S4.

-Sky-brightness i-band: We assign a 1.5% uncertainty to S3, and 3% systematic uncertainty to S4.

-Airmass in g-band: We assign a 2.5% uncertainty to S4.

-Airmass in r-band: We assign a 2% uncertainty to S4.

-Airmass in z-band: We assign a 1.5% uncertainty to S3, and 3% uncertainty to S4.

-USNO-B stars: We assign a 3% uncertainty to S3, and 5% uncertainty to S4.

• Bin 0.8 < z < 1.0: -Seeing in g-band: We assign a 2% uncertainty to S4.

-Sky-brightness in i-band: We assign a 2% uncertainty to S3, and a 3.5% uncertainty to S4.

-Airmass in g-band: We assign a 2% uncertainty to S4.

-Airmass in r-band: We assign a 3% uncertainty to S4.

-USNO-B stars: We assign a 3% uncertainty to S4.  Figure 11. Dependence of the moments S i with the variation in the value of potential systematic effects. We show an example for N side = 2048 in the redshift bin 0.2 < z < 0.4 using TPZ. The left column shows the behavior for S 2 , the middle column shows S 3 , and the last column shows the results for S 4 . The first row corresponds to the results for the seeing in i-band, the second row shows the results for seeing in g-band, the third shows the sky-brightness in i-band. Finally the last row shows the evolution of the moments with the variation in the number of stars per pixel.

• Bin 1.0 < z < 1.2:

-The measurement of S4 in this bin is dominated by systematics.

-Sky-brightness i-band: We assign 2% to S3.

-Sky-brightness z-band: We assign 3% to S3.

-USNO-B stars: We assign a 4.5% uncertainty to S3.

The estimated systematic errors for the bias are propagated from the estimation of the systematics in S2, S3, and S4. Their behavior is compatible with the systematics found in Crocce et al. (2016). We use the same data masking, excluding regions with large systematic values to recover w(θ). The linear bias is more robust using CiC since the variance, S2, is less affected by the small scale power induced by the systematics given that these scales are smoothed out. On the other hand, the non-linear bias is more sensitive to the presence of systematics because they can induce asymmetries in the density contrast distribution.


## Photometric redshift

Photometric redshift is one of the main potential sources for systematic effects in photometric surveys like DES. We have repeated the analysis in DES-SV data for a second estimate of the photometric redshift using BPZ (Benitez 2000). In Figure 12 we compare the results for the two photometric redshift codes and we see that they are in good agreement. The linear bias seems to be the most affected by the choice of a photometric redshift estimator but the results do not show any potential systematic biases. For the non-linear bias we get remarkably consistent results, showing the robustness of this method.


## Biasing models

Apart from the terms that we considered in our model, the authors in Bel et al. (2015) found that non-local bias terms are responsible for the overestimation of the linear bias from the three- As we mentioned previously in Section 5, we do not expect these terms to have a significant impact on our estimations because we analyze projected quantities over considerable volumes (note that we integrate in the cell and in the redshift slice). Having said that, we test the local and non-local models and find the results depicted in Figure 13. We can see, as in the case of the simulation, that both models are consistent within errors. This means that choosing the local model does not introduce any systematic uncertainties in our linear bias measurements. However, it affects the b2 measurements and their uncertainty since the new parameters introduced with these more complicated models are correlated with them. We check the probability of b2 being zero for the different models and obtain the results in table 1. We find b2 to be different from zero at a 3-σ level in the worst case (non-local). We also can see that in the first bin, none of the models fit the data well, which is not surpris-  ing, given that the range of (comoving) scales is very small (∼ 1 − 20 Mpc h −1 ) and non-linear clustering dominates. Finally, we are not considering stochastic models and we are assuming a Poisson shot-noise (see appendix A). This means that our measured b2 could be entangled with stochasticity (Pen 1998;Sato & Matsubara 2013). We leave the study of stochasticity to future works.


## Value of σ8

As mentioned in previous sections, our bias estimation depends linearly on the value of σ8. Thus, if the actual value of σ8 is different from our assumed fiducial value, our results will be biased, and we have to correct for the difference using equation 14. This is why, we introduce a systematic uncertainty of 1.4% (the uncertainty level in σ8 from Ade et al. (2014)) that we add in quadrature to the statistical errors in the final estimation of the bias.


# CONCLUSIONS

CiC is a simple but effective method to obtain the linear and non-linear bias. A good measurement of the galaxy bias is essential to maximize the performance of photometric redshift surveys because it can introduce a systematic effect on the determination of cosmological parameters. The galaxy bias is highly degenerate with other cosmological parameters and an independent method to determine it can break these degeneracies and improve the overall sensitivity to the underlying cosmology. In this paper we have developed a method to extract the bias from CiC. We use the MICE simulation to test our method and then perform measurements on the public Science Verification data from the Dark Energy Survey. The strength of this method is that it is based on a simple observable, the galaxy number counts, and is not demanding computationally.

We check that our linear bias measurement from CiC agrees with the real bias in the MICE simulation. Figure 7 shows an agreement between our measurement and the one obtained using the angular two-point correlation function. We then obtain the linear bias in the SV data and find that it is in agreement with previous bias measurements from other DES analyses. In Figure 10, we see that the CiC values are compatible with the two-point correlation study , the CMB-galaxy cross-correlations study , and the galaxy-galaxy lensing (Prat et al. 2018), and we demonstrate that these results are robust to the addition of new parameters in the biasing model, such as the non-local bias. Finally, we compute the nonlinear bias parameters up to third order. We detect a significant non-zero b2 component. It appears that the 2D and 3D predictions of the non-linear bias are in better agreement at larger scales, as expected. However, given the uncertainties associated with these quantities, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from b3 despite its compatibility with the expected 3D prediction. When more data is available, we plan to check if we can improve our constraints on b3 and whether the agreement with the 3D prediction improves as well. The systematic errors are in general lower than the statistical errors, in agreement with the systematic study done by .


## APPENDIX A: SHOT NOISE CORRECTION

Usually, in the analysis what we estimate are the central moments of the angular counts:
mJ (θ) ≡ ∞ i=0 (i − N ) J Pi(θ) (A1)
where Pi(θ) is the probability of finding i galaxies in a randomly selected cell of solid angle A and N ≡ i iPi is the average number of galaxies per cell. The galaxy density fluctuation in the cell is:
δg = (i − N ) N (A2)
and therefore:
mJ = N J δ J g (A3)
Ultimately, we want to obtain to estimate the averaged correlation functions wJ (θ) are the connected moments:
µJ ≡ N J δ J g c (A4)
We have to correct what we measure, which is δ J g , subtracting the lower order contributions. Up to third order we do not have any contributions but at J = 4 we do. The connected part is the contribution to δ1, ..., δj which does not include any conditional probability of lower order. To estimate the connected graphs we introduce a momentgenerating function:
M (t) = ∞ j=0 mj j! = e iδ (A5) where mj = d j dt j M (t) t=0
and the connected moments are:
µj = d j dt j log M (t) t=0(A6)
Up to J = 4 (Gaztañaga 1994):
µ2 = m2 µ3 = m3 µ4 = m4 − 3m 2 2 (A7)
Also due to discreteness, δ J g c is not a good estimator unless N 1. We have to subtract the shot noise which affects measurements from J = 2 on. We use a Poisson model with generating function MP oisson(t) = M (e t − 1) to obtain better estimators (Gaztañaga 1994):
k2 = µ2 − N k3 = µ3 − 3k2 − N k4 = µ4 − 7k2 − N (A8)
where terms to the right of µJ are the shot-noise correction. Then in our case, we subtract the shot noise from what we measure δ J g = m J N J :
δ 2 c = k2 N 2 = δ 2 g − 1 N δ 3 c = k3 N 3 = δ 3 g − 3 N δ 2 c − 1 N 2 δ 4 c = δ 4 g − 3 δ 2 g 2 − 7 N 2 δ 2 c − 6 N δ 3 c − 1 N 3 (A9) where N is N = N tot gal * A pix A tot
, being N tot gal the total number of galaxies, Atot the total area, and Apix the area of the pixel.

Then the final moments would be:
S2 = δ 2 c S3 = δ 3 c δ 2 2 c S4 = δ 4 c δ 2 3 c (A10)

## APPENDIX B: DIFFERENT PIXEL SHAPES

We check with the MICE simulation in a thin redshift bin (0.95 < z < 1.05) that as long as we have regular polygon pixels the difference in the moments of the density contrast is negligible. In Figure B1 we see that the difference is negligible for the more symmetrical pixels and higher for less symmetrical ones. The angular aperture, θ, is estimated as the square root of the pixel area. We compare rectangular pixels with HEALpix pixels. We divide the sphere into rectangular pixels taking nra parts in right ascension, and nct parts in sin dec where the number of pixels is npix=nra ·nct = 12·N side ·N side . We have taken six different pixel shapes numbered from 1 to 6. Pixels number 3 (nra = 3N side , nct = 4N side ), 4 (nra = 4N side , nct = 3N side ) and 6 (nra = 6N side , nct = 2N side ) are close to being squares, but pixels number 1 (nra = 12N side , nct = 1N side ), 2 (nra = 1N side , nct = 12N side ) and 5 (nra = 2N side , nct = 6N side ) are far from being regular polygons. When we compare square and HEALpix pixels we see that the measured moments are in perfect agreement.


## APPENDIX C: BOUNDARY EFFECTS

To deal with the boundary effects of an irregularly shaped area, we use the mask and degrade its resolution to match each of the pixel scales being used. However, degrading the mask (or increasing the scale) results in an increasing number of partially filled pixels. Only a fraction rA = A filled /A pixel remain completely inside the footprint. This means that, if we assign the same scale to all the pixels of a given N side value, some pixels will be effectively mapping a different scale. To solve this problem we can either require a minimum fraction of the pixel to be full, rA X, or we can compute the fraction of full pixels and perform CiC for that scale. We prefer to use the former because we consider that the scales where we perform the study appropriately map the variations of the density field in which we are interested. This approach also helps to avoid certain boundary effects. For small pixel sizes (similar to the size in the mask), given the large number of pixels, we can safely choose rA = 1.

For bigger pixels we try to find a compromise between the amount of area that we lose and the boundary effects. In Figures C1 and C2 we show the area loss using data from MICE in the redshift bin 0.95 < z < 1.05 with the SV mask for different thresholds in rA and in Figure C3 the change in the moments for these different area cuts. We see that if we choose pixels that are completely contained inside the mask (rA = 1.0), we lose a lot of area for smaller values of N side , however, very little area is lost for large values of N side . It can be seen that results are consistent for the different threshold values for rA. We also see that if we  Figure B1. Moments of the density contrast distribution as a function of the cell scale using data from MICE in the redshift slice 0.95 < z < 1.05 for different pixel shapes. Pixels number 3 (nra = 3N side , nct = 4N side ), 4 (nra = 4N side , nct = 3N side ) and 6 (nra = 6N side , nct = 2N side ) are close to being squares, but pixels number 1 (nra = 12N side , nct = 1N side ), 2 (nra = 1N side , nct = 12N side ) and 5 (nra = 2N side , nct = 6N side ) are far from being regular polygons.

take all the pixels (rA 0), the difference in the moments is considerable in some cases, and we cannot take just all the pixels inside the mask (rA = 1) because we run out of them for large scales. We set a threshold rA 0.9 to ensure that the pixels are almost completely embedded in the footprint. This prevents us from mixing scales even for the largest pixel sizes. This can be noted in Figure C1 where a large drop in area occurs between rA = 0.8 and rA = 0.9 for N side 1024, setting this threshold naturally. For most scales this threshold does not change the errors. By choosing rA 0.9 the effective cell sizes are well determined and the errors are reasonably small.
