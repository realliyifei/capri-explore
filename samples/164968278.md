Material e métodos: realizou-se uma busca no Pubmed (Medline) com intuito de se identificar artigos publicados em inglês entre 1 de janeiro de 2000 e 31 de junho de 2018, em que se utilizava o enxerto Bio-Oss previamente a instalação de implantes em humanos. Foram selecionados 40 estudos completos para uma análise detalhada. A partir dessa análise foram identificados 18 artigos para inclusão nessa revisão. Resultados: os artigos analisados na revisão mostraram diversos efeitos benéficos desse xenoenxerto, como: propriedades osteocondutoras positivas, recuperação de alturas ósseas em locais com atrofias graves, reabsorção lenta do xenoenxerto sugerindo estabilidade a longo prazo, taxas de sobrevivência e sucesso de implantes colocados em locais enxertados variando de 91 a 100% em diversas pesquisas. Conclusão: a utilização do biooss como substituto ósseo é uma alternativa viável na colocação previamente ao implante dentário, sendo utilizado na prática clínica e comprovado em diversos estudos sua eficácia, devido sua similaridade com o osso natural e seu alto grau de osteocondutividade.


## INTRoDuCTIoN

O ne of the dentist's challenges in surgical clinical practice, is to deal with bone reconstruction that comes after trauma, infection, neoplasies or periodontal disease [1]. The use of bone grafts aims to improve bone regeneration after surgical procedures and works as a support to blood clot, reducing the risk of soft tissue breakdown in the bone defects [2].

Bone grafts can be classified as autogenous, harvested from donor site of the patient itself; homologous, when collected in the same species, but different individuals; xenogene, when collected in different species; alloplastic, when formed by a laboratory developed synthetic material [3,4].

The characteristics of an ideal bone graft material are: can be gradually replaced by newly formed bone, have osteoconductive or osteoinductive properties [5], be biocompatible and easy to manage during surgical procedures [6].

Autogenous grafts are considered "gold standard" due to its osteogenic, osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties [7]. Its predictability is the main choosing fator, concerning that is the only one that offers to the receiver site, cells with growth factors and with bone neoformation properties [8]. Their disadvantages are associated to a higher post operative morbidity, donor site availability, unforseen graft resorption, and many times, the need of extraoral harvesting sites. [9,10].

With the focus on overcome such limitations and in association with high scientific and technological development, the biomaterials have arised as an altertative to the use of autogenous grafts [11].

Bovine biomaterials are used as a bone replacement material and have been studied since the 60's. Bio-Oss (Geistlich) is a xenogene bone graft, which all the organic compounds are removed, maintaining its natural mineral architecture. Its structure is physically and chemically comparable to the mineralized matrix of human bone [12]. Besides, presentes the advantage towards the autogenous bone graft the fact of being slowly reabsorbed, acting as a scaffold to new bone formation during all the regenerative process [10,13,14].

Concerning the researches that have been developed, it was examined that there are previous studies about this theme, being one of the most studied materials owing to its proven osteoconductive properties [13][14][15][16][17]. However, few recent studies were found, being required a new literature review that approaches the advantages of using Bio-Oss (Geistlich) and the case report that assures its efficacy in clinical practice. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate through a litetature review the benefits of Bio-Oss to regenerative tissue treatment previously to implants placement.


## mATeRIAl AND meThoDS

A search into PubMed (MEDLINE) was made in order to identify scientific articles in english, published between January 1st, 2000 to 31st of june 2018, where the use of Bio-Oss used previouly to implant placement was performed. The search was made using the key-words: Bio-Oss, dental implants, bone grafts, implant, human, bone transplantation.

The initial search resulted in 262 articles. Therefore, after title and abstract critical reading, some studies were excluded because they found to be incompatible to the objective of this study, and 40 articles were selected to a detailed analysis. From this analysis, 18 articles were finally selected to be included in this review, and only randomized controlled trials.

## DISCuSSIoN

The reconstruction of bone deformities, by trauma, infection, neoplasies or periodontal disease is one of challenges for the dentist [1]. On the other hand of this statement, the use of bone grafts allows to guide bone regeneration after a surgical procedure.

Bio-Oss is a bone substitute of bovine origin (xenograft), in which all the organic components are extracted, supporting the natural bone architecture. Due to its structure, Bio-Oss is phisically and chemically comparable to mineralized matrix of human boné [12].This material is highly referredin literature owing to its osteoconductive qualities, high biocompatibility, and proficiency related to autogenous bone graft in undergoing slower resorption , serving as a scaffold to bone neoformation during regenerative process [13,14,10].

The histological findings demonstrate that the Bio-Oss particles are connected between each other through bone bridges and covered by newly formed bone tissue [25][26][27]31] [27,26].

Was compared the potential of a synthetic bone substitute related to the bovine origin xenograft on preserving bone dimensions. As a result, both grafts preserved all clinical dimensions of the site, giving support to new bone formation, and allowing the placement of dental implants [31].

In respect of Bio-Oss employment, researches report higher survival rates of the implant, when the graft was used isolatedly [22,36],showing predictable long-term clinical results [21].

The slow resorption oh the bovine xenograft, is considered a positive characteristic, suggesting long term stablity of regenerated tissue [30,35].

The slow remodelling process, maintains the volume during a longer period of time, corroborating to the persistance of interproximal bone height in the grafted site untill implants are functionally loaded and natural bone remodelling occurs [34].

Due to its limited biodegradation, the hyphotesis is that Bio-Oss is a prerrogative to bone preservation and long-term implant sucess [19] .

Bio-Oss is widely used in maxillary sinus grafting . Accordingly to several studies, patients treated with implants after procedures of maxillary sinus grafting with xenograft, presented a great clinical response, ratifying the assertivity of material usage for grafting procedures in those sites [19,20,25,26,35].

Cordoraro et al. [33] confirmed the advantage of using xenograft (Bio-Oss) because it provides confort to patient and surgeon, in spite of surgery is restrained to the host site, avoiding bone harvesting procedures that are necessary to use autogenous graft.

Accordingly to Schmitt et al. [19], the addition of autogenous bone together with Bio-Oss has no beneficial effect when compared to isolated use of Bio-Oss in the maxillary sinus grafting. Therefore, these authors preach the isolated use of Bio-Oss, because the same avoids the harvesting of autogenous bone, decreasing the possible patient morbidity.

In spite of the numerous benefits of Bio-Oss already mentioned, it has some disadvantages, such as the time between grafting and its integration into the recipient bed, which can vary from 6 to 10 months, which may stimulate the search for its association with other substances that accelerate the local bone neoformation [37].

Hallman et al. shows in his study that a longer healing period is required for the maxillary sinus grafted only with Bio-Oss because the new bone proliferation occurs only from the peripheral walls of the bone, so the addition of autogenous bone along with Bio-Oss facilitates the proliferation of vessels and tissues; thus, new bone formation and incorporation of the grafts takes less time to heal.


## CoNCluSIoN

It is concluded that the use of bio-oss as a bone substitute is a viable alternative in the placement before dental implants, being used in clinical practice and with proved efficacy in several studies, due to its similarity with the bone and its high level of osteoconductivity.
