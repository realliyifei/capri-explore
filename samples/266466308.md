# stressors to elicit greater stress responses than other forms of stressors. This study tested the hypothesis that following days when a person exhibits greater negative affect (NA) reactivity to stressors (versus on days with less NA reactivity), sleep quality will be lower. This link between affective reactivity to stressors and subsequent sleep was expected to be more pronounced for interpersonal stressors versus noninterpersonal stressors. Methods: In this pre-registered study, 252 adults in British Columbia, Canada (ages 25 to 87y; 68% women; 64% White) completed mobile surveys 5x/day for 14 days to assess daily stressors and NA. Self-reported sleep quality was assessed in morning surveys. Multilevel-models tested daily stressors (interpersonal, non-interpersonal, or no stressors), daily NA (averaged across the day), and their interaction as predictors of subsequent sleep quality, controlling for prior-night sleep quality and sociodemographics. Results: Daily NA and stressor occurrence independently predicted poorer subsequent sleep quality. Stressor type moderated the relationship between NA and sleep quality, such that this association was stronger for interpersonal compared to non-interpersonal stressors. Discussion: The findings suggest that encountering interpersonal stressors may be particularly impactful to one's subsequent sleep. Future studies should consider investigating potential mechanisms that may underlie this association, such as pre-sleep cognitive, emotional, and physiological arousal

Family dementia caregivers experience increased burden and stress that can negatively impact emotion regulation and overall well-being.Further, a lack of social connection may contribute to emotion dysregulation among dementia caregivers.The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between daily caregiving stress, social isolation, emotion regulation, and depression in a sample of community-dwelling dementia caregivers.Participants (N=30) completed a baseline survey and a series of daily diaries over a 14-day period (n=323 data points) that asked about day-to-day caregiving experiences.Data were analyzed using mixed-level modeling.Higher than average stress related to behavioral symptoms of dementia was associated with an increase in the odds of experiencing feelings of losing control over one's emotions (OR=1.08,95% CI [1.01, 1.15], p<0.05).Similarly, higher perceived social isolation on a given day was associated with an increase in the daily odds of feeling a loss of control over one's emotions (OR=1.28,95% CI [1.00, 1.27], p<0.05).Further, feeling a loss of control over one's emotions was associated with an increase in the daily odds of depression-related symptoms (OR=3.39,95% CI [1.43,  8.08], p<0.01).These findings highlight the importance of

addressing the emotional well-being of family dementia caregivers, particularly in the context of stress related to behavioral symptoms of dementia and social isolation.Caregiver support programs and interventions that focus on improving emotion regulation and reducing social isolation may help promote the mental health and well-being of dementia caregivers.Loneliness is associated with maladaptive cognitions (e.g., rumination and intrusive thoughts) among young adults, but less is known about this association among older adults.Experiencing loneliness and intrusive thoughts throughout daily life may disrupt emotion regulation and increase risk for cognitive decline during later life.Moreover, social and cognitive factors, including marital status and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), may be protective or exacerbating factors that moderate these associations.For example, having close relationships (e.g., being married) is associated with better mental health and overall well-being for older adults and intrusive thoughts have been associated with poorer cognitive performance.We used multilevel modeling to examine the association between momentary loneliness and intrusive thoughts among older adults and whether MCI and marital status moderated this association.Participants were 316 diverse older adults without dementia (40% Black; 13% Hispanic, mean age = 77.45years, 67% women) living in the Bronx, NY who completed ecological momentary assessments 5 times daily for 14 consecutive days.There was a significant three-way interaction (Î² = -0.175,p < 0.05) such that the association between momentary loneliness and intrusive thoughts was strongest for those with MCI who were not married and weakest for those with MCI who were married.Covariates included race/ethnicity, years of education, age, and gender.These findings suggest that for those who have MCI, being married may be a protective factor against moments of loneliness and intrusive thoughts.For those who are not married, tailoring interventions to accommodate MCI status may be worthwhile.

## NOVEL APPROACHES AND OUTCOMES TO INVESTIGATE RECOVERY AND MOBILITY IN HIP FRACTURE PATIENTS Chair: Carl-Philipp Jansen

Hip fracture is the most frequent non-intentional injury of older persons leading to hospital admission in North America and Europe.Failure to fully recover and regain pre-fracture function and mobility is considered the single most important disability symptom experienced by hip fracture patients; severe detrimental effects on older adults' physical, mental, and psychosocial health are reported.Being able to move back and live independently at home is seen as one of the most important aspects of recovery.However, at present, mere survival and care home admission are still the predominant reported outcomes in the recovery and rehabilitation phase.Only limited attention has been given to outcomes such as days at home or mobility performance in everyday life.At the same time, aspects of mobility recovery grounded in patients' experience have not been addressed appropriately so far.Against this background, this symposium brings together research endeavours from Europe and North America, presenting novel approaches to investigate and disentangle trajectories of hip fracture recovery in older adults.In the first two talks, healthy days at home are investigated as central outcome after hip fracture with two different foci: the contribution of cognitive impairment to sex-based differences in recovery, and pre-vs.post-fracture development.The last two talks investigate mobility in hip fracture patients, again with two foci: results of real-world sensor-based mobility performance are presented and compared against patient-reported outcomes, and a conceptual framework of walking was developed based on a systematic review on patients' walking experience.

## IMPACT OF SEX AND ADRD ON DAYS SPENT AT HOME AFTER HIP FRACTURE AMONG OLDER MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES

University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States, 2. University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, United States, 3. University of Maryland Baltimore, Baltimore, Maryland, United States Men recovering from hip fracture tend to have poorer health and outcomes compared to women.Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD), which is differentially recognized between the sexes, is one potential factor contributing to these differences.Data were drawn from 2010-2017 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years and older who survived hospitalization for hip fracture.Our primary outcome was days alive and at home (DAAH) which subtracts from 365 the number of days in a hospital and/or rehabilitation facility, nursing home, emergency department or hospital observation, and days not alive (index fracture admission day to date of death, if applicable).Multivariable Poisson regressions were adjusted for demographics, injury severity, chronic disease burden, and hospital-level fixed effects, to model the association between DAAH and ADRD in the 12 months post hip fracture, with an interaction term for sex and ADRD status.Among survivors, males with ADRD spent a mean of 160.7 DAAH compared to 228.4 for males without ADRD, 177.8 for females with ADRD and 248.0 for females without ADRD.In adjusted analyses, males without ADRD spent 8.2% fewer DAAH compared to females (rate ratio (RR)=0.92,95% CI 0.92-0.92).This sex difference increased significantly when comparing those living with ADRD, with males spending an additional 3.3% fewer DAAH (interaction RR=0.96, 95% CI 0.96-0.97).Males spend fewer DAAH after hip fracture than females and males with ADRD have the fewest DAAH.This suggests that cognitive impairment may be a small but significant contributor to sex-based differences observed during hip fracture recovery.Hip fracture is a disabling event experienced disproportionately by older adults with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD).Understanding how to better prognosticate outcomes for this population could drive more tailored clinical decision making.Our objective was to identify distinct trajectories of health before a hip fracture and determine their influences on post-fracture recovery trajectories and 1-year mortality rates among older adults with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD).We conducted a cohort study of 16,576 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries living with ADRD who experienced hip fracture between 2010 and 2017.We used latent mixture modeling to evaluate trajectories of days at home assessed monthly up to 180 days prior to hospitalization, and their associations with post-fracture days at home and 1-year mortality.Before a hip fracture, 3 distinct trajectories were identified: Robust (n=14,980, 90.3%), Impaired but Improving (n=809, 5.3%), and Impaired and Declining (n=787, 4.7%).Membership in the Impaired and Declining pre-fracture trajectory was strongly associated with membership in less favorable post-fracture recovery trajectories and 65% higher 1-year mortality rate (hazard ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.45-1.87)as compared to those in the Robust trajectory group.Similar albeit weaker associations were observed between membership in the Impaired but Improving prefracture trajectory and post-fracture outcomes.Overall, our results indicate that pre-fracture days at home trajectories are highly associated with post-hospitalization outcomes among older adults with ADRD and could be used to guide care management decisions.
