The recommendation system is an application model based on observations of the circumstances and customer desires. In the recommendation system, several methods are used to support how the system works in producing information. One method of recommendation system that is quite popular is the method Hybrid. Several researchers have successfully applied this method in developing a tourism recommendation system, therefore to achieve the goal of implementing a tourism recommendation, it is better to take advantage of a marketing technique such as promotion in order to increase sales and attract more comprehensive customers. Therefore, a literature review on the method hybrid (Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering) of this travel recommendation system is carried out to collaborate between methods, algorithms, and a tool or media marketing applied in a recommendation system.

## INTRODUCTION

Tourism is an industry that is growing quite rapidly these days. As a result, the tourism sector is the second largest contributor to foreign exchange after palm oil exports (BPS, 2021). In 2018, the tourism sector contributed USD 16,426 billion, increasing around 25 percent from 2017, amounting to USD 13,139 billion (BPS, 2021). Based on this fact, the tourism sector is an attractive sector for further development by a country.

Indonesia has various types and places as tourist destinations. Apart from its natural and cultural beauty, Indonesia is also rich in unique flora and fauna diversity. This becomes interesting if biodiversity is managed and becomes an educational tourism destination. In general, the management of flora and fauna diversity as a tourist attraction has been widely recognized in zoo representation. However, the zoo is now made more specific with the times, such as butterfly park and bird park.

The recommendation system is an application model based on observations of the circumstances and customer desires. Therefore, the recommendation system requires a suitable recommendation model so that the recommended one is by the customer's wishes and makes it easier for customers to make the right decisions in determining the product or service to be used [1]. This recommendation system can be applied in various industrial fields as a way or a tool to promote products or just what is offered. Several methods are used in the recommendation system to support how the system produces information, such as Hybrid, Collaborative Filtering, and Content-Based Filtering, TOPSIS, Deep Learning. [2]. This paper focuses on Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering methods, and social media as a marketing medium for a recommendation system. Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation system algorithm where recommendations are given based on data considerations from other users. Meanwhile, Content-Based Filtering is the provision of recommendations given by exploring the contents of user profiles, product descriptions, or things related to the formation of user choices for an item [1]. The disadvantage of these two methods is that they cannot recommend new types of items or have never been seen by the user before. This is because this method is based on the items that the user has rated. The method is a weakness of Collaborative Filtering that when an item is entered, and no one has given a rating at all, then the item cannot be recommended to any user [3].

So to cover the weaknesses of these methods, it can be done using the hybrid method, which is combining several methods found in the recommendation system to produce recommendation items according to the user's wishes. This literature review is the initial stage planned by the author to conduct research related to recommendation systems using the method Hybrid (Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering) by utilizing tools or media such as social media and search engines as an effort to increase sales and be able to attract more comprehensive visitors using data sources that come from scientific articles.

The next part of this paper is structured as follows: Part II discusses the literature review related to research. Part III discusses the methodology used. Part IV discusses the discussion of the results of the literature review. Finally, part V is the conclusion.


## RELATED WORK

Based on a literature review of recommendation systems, many researchers have defined, categorized, and discussed recommendation systems as a solution in marketing to increase sales and attract more comprehensive customers. Several studies have successfully adopted a recommendation system using Hybrid Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering methods to calculate the similarity between variables [4]. In the development of the recommendation system, previous researchers combined several methods and algorithms, one of the examples is using K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), which is used for Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CB) calculations with results showing that the calculation results effective enough to provide recommendations to users [5], [6]. This method can also be combined with the Pearson Correlation to calculate user ratings on items [7].

The Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm is used to find closeness between new cases and old cases based on matching weights of existing attributes. Research that uses Nearest People intends to build a tourist recommendation system in determining trips using route information, time, accommodation, and nearby places by combining K-NN and Apriori algorithms for classification [8]. The Apriori algorithm performs frequent itemset searches using the association rule technique. In this study, Collaborative Filtering and Apriori algorithms are applied to build a recommendation system based on information from users, which produces a relatively good level of accuracy [9].

Besides using the K-NN algorithm and Apriori algorithm, other research uses the collaborative filtering method by calculating similarity using the Cosine similarity measures by calculating the similarities between two items from the cosine angle [10], [11]. Variance analysis test (ANOVA) is also used [12] to test a hypothesis by comparing the average sample size of the Hybrid Collaborative Filtering and Knowledge-based Filtering methods. Results can provide recommendations for tourist destinations according to user wishes by determining tourist destinations, costs, and the category. Other algorithms such as the Genetic Algorithm [13] can help in increasing the computational efficiency in a visit, for example, and can shorten the calculation time compared to standard algorithms.

Collaborative Filtering is also considered inefficient in handling combined location preferences. It requires other methods to complement the shortcomings of collaboration so that the research adopts K-means to participate users into multiple filtering clusters [14]. The application of a recommendation model collaborative filtering based on the correlation coefficient of time and K-means for recommendations with the results of the trials conducted shows effective results to obtain fast and accurate recommendations that have also been successfully implemented [15].

Another research tries to combine Hybrid Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering, and Location-Based Service (LBS) [16], aiming to improve the quality of tourism services by building an automatic recommendation system application can run on mobile devices. LBS itself is used to filter information based on the distance to the position of spots in a tourism area. This application built can integrate google maps virtual maps and tourist information services.

Another method that researchers often use to combine with Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering is Demographic Filtering by classifying based on user information which aims to recommend visitors to specific places according to preferences of places previously visited [17][18] [19 ].

In addition to using methods and algorithms, several studies also utilize social media as a recommendation, one of which is research [20] which utilizes Twitter by considering the number of URLs, hashtags, and some favorites value to a tweet. The results of the evaluation conducted by the researchers showed a predictive accuracy of 68%. Another study [21] utilized a google maps application to implement a recommendation system using real-time dynamic multimodal routes based on user preferences, point-of-view (POI), and route scenario. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a technique to maximize the value of a website, and it is better known or easily read by search engines which aims to increase the number of website visitors. This technique has been successfully applied [22]. This study aims to target keywords that align with the target and determine competitors in targeting these keywords.
