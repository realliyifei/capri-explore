This case report describes macular hole (MH) formation and spontaneous closure after vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair. A 58-year-old man referred with a macula-off superior RRD, in whom vitrectomy was performed. MH with vitreomacular traction (VMT) caused by the posterior vitreous cortex remnants developed 2 weeks after vitrectomy. Four weeks postoperatively, optical coherence tomography revealed resolution of the VMT and spontaneous closure of MH without providing any treatment. This is the first report of an MH formation and spontaneous closure after vitrectomy for RRD. This suggests that the VMT mediated by the posterior vitreous cortex remnants has an important role in the development of secondary MH.

Macular hole (MH) develops from tangential anteroposterior traction by the vitreous. [1] This is supported by histopathological studies and optical coherence tomography (OCT). [2,3] In several diseases, MH may develop after vitrectomy. [4] Brown first reported secondary MH after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair in 1998. [5] Previous several studies described that MH can develop after vitrectomy. [6,7] However, we found no previous reports on MH formation and spontaneous closure after vitrectomy for RRD. This report describes the first description of MH and spontaneous closure after vitrectomy for RRD with clear documentation by OCT and provides an understanding of the mechanisms of secondary MH after vitrectomy.


## Case Report

A 58-year-old man with decreased vision (20/200) and inferior visual field defect in his left eye referred to our hospital. Fundoscopy, OCT, and B-scan ultrasonography showed a macula-off superior RRD with a superior horseshoe-like tear [ Fig. 1]. The Pars plana vitrectomy (23 gauge) was performed after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. At the end of the surgery, fluid-air exchange, endolaser photocoagulation, and gas tamponade (SF6, 20%) were performed by the author. The patient was instructed to maintain a supine position for 7 postoperative days.

After 2 weeks, the postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) had decreased to 20/400, which was lower than the preoperative BCVA, even though the entire retina was attached. OCT showed an MH with vitreomacular traction (VMT) caused by the posterior vitreous cortex remnants [ Fig. 2]. We decided to monitor the patient's progress without providing any other treatment. 


## Discussion

The development of MH after RRD repair is a rare occurrence. The prevalence of the development of secondary MH after RRD repair ranges from 0.24% to 0.5% in literature. [5,7] Brown first reported secondary MH after RRD. [5] Recent studies reported secondary MH formation after vitrectomy for RRD repair. [6,7] The mechanism of secondary MH after vitrectomy for RRD is not well known. Several studies support at least 2 pathogenic mechanisms for MH formation in the vitrectomized eyes. [5][6][7][8] One mechanism is related to cystoid macular edema, without vitreoretinal traction. In this mechanism, cystoid degeneration develops, the small cysts merge together to form a larger cyst, and the larger cyst can directly rupture to form a full-thickness MH. [7,8] The other mechanism is vitreofoveal tangential traction, which may play a role in the development of full-thickness MH. [4,6,7] The vitreofoveal traction such as an epiretinal membrane (ERM) results in a subfoveal cyst, which subsequently develops into a full-thickness MH. ERM was found to be one of the underlying pathologies in the development of MH after vitrectomy. [4,6] Kumagai et al. [6] reported 47 cases of secondary MH after vitrectomy, showing This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms. This is similar to the proposed mechanism for the MH related VMT. Vitreomacular adhesion is observed after partial posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), when a portion of the posterior vitreous remains attached to the macula. The tangential contraction of the vitreous cortex remnants layer can lead to macular distortion and edema and to the formation of MH. [9] Recent studies have reported that removal of VMT through enzymatic vitreolysis can assist MH closure. [9,10] In this case, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the postvitreous cortex around the disc region was removed, but due to insufficient PVD induction, remnant posterior vitreous cortex remained in the macular region. We believe that induced VMT was the cause of MH and spontaneous removal of VMT lead to the closing of MH.


## Summary

Similar mechanisms could have caused secondary MH after vitrectomy in our case. VMT by the posterior vitreous cortex remnants plays an important role in the development of secondary MH, and the release of VMT may have been the main reason for the eventual closure of the MH. Our findings conclusively provide an understanding of the mechanisms of secondary MH after vitrectomy. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

## Ocular manifestations in lipoid proteinosis: A rare clinical entity


## Sumana J Kamath, HimaBindu Marthala, BinduMadhavi Manapragada

Lipoid proteinosis is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis with abnormal lipid protein complexes deposition in different parts of the body, especially in the skin and mucus membranes of the upper aerodigestive tract. Though ocular involvement in lipoid proteinosis is rare, ophthalmologists may encounter diverse ocular complications accompanying this syndrome in clinical practice. We describe a case of lipoid proteinosis involving bilateral eyelids with pathognomonic moniliform blepharosis in a 33-year-old gentleman who presented with the complaints of itching of eye lids on and off since 10 years.

Key words: Lipoid proteinosis, moniliform blepharosis, Urbach-Wiethe syndrome Lipoid proteinosis, also known as Urbach-Wiethe syndrome or hyalinosis cutis et mucosae, first described by a dermatologist

Urbach and an otolaryngologist Wiethe in 1929. It is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with dermatological, otorhinolaryngological, ocular, and neurological manifestations due to mutation of extracellular-matrix protein-1 gene located on chromosome 1q21. [1] It is characterized by the deposition of an amorphous hyaline material with a glycoprotein constitution in various tissues in the body mainly the larynx, skin, and tongue. [2] Though this entity has been well known to dermatologists and otorhinolaryngologists, few reports have appeared in the ophthalmic literature with the eyelids involvement in the majority of the cases. [2,3] We describe a case of lipoid proteinosis involving bilateral eyelids with pathognomonic moniliform blepharosis in a 33-year-old gentleman who presented with the complaints of itching of eyelids on and off since 10 years.


## Case Report

This study conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was conducted after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee on Human Research and informed written consent from the patient.

A 33-year-old gentleman presented to our outpatient department with complaints of itching of eyelids in both eyes on and off since 10 years. On ophthalmic examination, unaided visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, anterior segment examination revealed rows of yellow-white color, round or oval, bead-like excrescences on the margins of all four lids and the caruncle, resembling a string of pearls, the pathognomonic, This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.

Four weeks after the vitrectomy, OCT revealed spontaneous resolution of the VMT as well as the posterior vitreous cortex remnants and MH [Fig. 3]. Further, his vision improved to 20/100. Finally, the MH had completely closed [Fig. 3] and his BCVA was 20/40 after 6 weeks.
