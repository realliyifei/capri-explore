Resolved Molecular Gas Observations of MaNGA Post-starbursts Reveal a Tumultuous Past1) PSBs with spatially resolved optical IFS data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey
October 25, 2022 21 Oct 2022(Received August 26, 2022; Revised October 19, 2022; Accepted October 25, 2022)Draft version Typeset using L A T E X twocolumn style in AASTeX631 Corresponding author: Justin Atsushi Otter
Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) have recently and rapidly quenched their star-formation, thus they are an important way to understand how galaxies transition from star-forming late-types to quiescent early-types. The recent discovery of large cold gas reservoirs in PSBs calls into question the theory that galaxies must lose their gas to become quiescent. Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys have revealed two classes of PSBs: central PSBs with central quenching regions and ring PSBs with quenching in their outskirts. We analyze a sample of 13 nearby (z < 0.

and matched resolution Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 12 CO(1-0). Disturbed stellar kinematics in 7/13 of our PSBs and centrally concentrated molecular gas is consistent with a recent merger for most of our sample. In galaxies without merger evidence, alternate processes may funnel gas inwards and suppress star-formation, which may include outflows, stellar bars, and minor mergers or interactions. The star-formation efficiencies of the post-starburst regions in nearly half our galaxies are suppressed while the gas fractions are consistent with star-forming galaxies. AGN feedback may drive this stabilization, and we observe AGN-consistent emission in the centers of 5/13 galaxies. Finally, our central and ring PSBs have similar properties except the ionized and molecular gas in central PSBs is more disturbed. Overall, the molecular gas in our PSBs tends to be compact and highly disturbed, resulting in concentrated gas reservoirs unable to form stars efficiently.


## INTRODUCTION

The global star-formation rates of galaxies form a bimodal distribution, resulting in a division between star-forming late-type galaxies and quiescent early-type galaxies . The galactic colormagnitude diagram quantifies this divide with primarily early-type galaxies occupying the red sequence and latetype galaxies dominating the blue cloud (Baldry et al. 2004;Jin et al. 2014). Blue cloud galaxies are generally star-forming, gas-rich, and have disk morphologies, whereas red sequence galaxies are predominantly quiescent and gas-poor (Blanton & Moustakas 2009). A significant population of galaxies have transitioned from the blue cloud to the red sequence over the last ∼6 Gyr (Bell et al. 2007(Bell et al. , 2012Ilbert et al. 2013). Galaxies undergoing such a transition must somehow quench their star-formation and eventually deplete their gas reservoirs. While many quenching and gas expulsion mechanisms have been proposed, there is much work remaining to fully understand the relative importance of these processes through cosmic time.

A successful quenching mechanism must either deplete the galaxy's gas reservoirs or suppress star-formation by making it more difficult for the gas to collapse and form stars. Galaxies could lose their molecular gas by expelling their gas through outflows (e.g. Feruglio et al. 2010; Baron et al. 2017), exhausting their gas reservoirs in a starburst or from a lack of gas accretion (Bekki et al. 2002;Davis et al. 2011), and finally through environmental processes such as ram pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972;Chung et al. 2009) or fast galaxy interactions (Mihos 1995;Moore et al. 1996;Bekki 1998). While these mechanisms may be important in removing gas from galaxies as they transition to the red sequence, the existence of quenched and quenching galaxies with significant molecular gas reservoirs demonstrates that quenching mechanisms that stabilize the molecular gas against star-formation are also important. These processes suppressing star-formation could include active galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar feedback (e.g. Heckman et al. 1990; Kaviraj et al. 2007;Cicone et al. 2014), morphological quenching (Martig et al. 2009), and stellar bars (Salim et al. 2020).

The ability of the gas to collapse and form stars can be captured by the star-formation efficiency (SFE) of a galaxy, the star-formation rate per molecular gas mass. On a cloud scale, the SFE is governed by sub-kpc gas properties such as turbulence (Krumholz & McKee 2005;Murray 2011;Federrath & Klessen 2012;Krumholz et al. 2012), whereas global star-formation properties of galaxies are impacted by global galaxy properties and the galaxy's environment (Bluck et al. 2020). Thus, to fully understand the evolution of gas and star-formation in a galaxy, both global and local scales must be considered.

To gain a better understanding of how various quenching mechanisms transform star-forming galaxies to quiescent ones, we study the population of galaxies currently undergoing this transition. Schawinski et al. (2014) found that optically green colors alone are not enough to classify a transitioning population, as many late-type green valley galaxies are typical spiral galaxies with a larger buildup of intermediate-age stars or an excess of dust. Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) are ideal for studying short-timescale evolution to quiescence as they have recently (in the last Gyr) and rapidly quenched their star-formation.

Classical post-starbursts, or "E/K+A" galaxies, are galaxies with a dominant intermediate-age (A-star) stellar population and a lack of emission lines typically associated with star-formation, such as Hα or [O II]λ3727Å. These characteristics indicate a recent, rapid quenching of star-formation after a starburst, leaving a dominant A-type stellar population (typically identified with Balmer series absorption lines) and little-to-no on-going star-formation. Though classical post-starbursts have indeed quenched their star-formation recently, they represent an older population of transitioning galaxies as the strict cut on emission line strength removes poststarburst galaxies at the beginning of their transition. Emission line cuts can select against PSBs hosting energetic processes that produce emission lines, such as shocks and AGN, though more recent E+A selection methods allow for lines associated with these processes such as [NII] (e.g. Wild et al. 2007; Greene et al. 2021). Other PSB selection methods require emission line ratios consistent with shock excitation (Alatalo et al. 2016a), or have no emission line requirements at all (Wild et al. 2007;Wild et al. 2009;Rowlands et al. 2015Rowlands et al. , 2018. Different post-starburst selection methods result in overlapping but distinct samples with different physical properties. A detailed discussion of post-starburst selection criteria can be found in French (2021).

Recently, a number of studies have begun to probe the conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) in PSBs, yielding insights into the mechanisms driving star-formation suppression in these galaxies. Crucially, these studies find that PSBs have significant molecular gas reservoirs (French et al. 2015;Rowlands et al. 2015;Alatalo et al. 2016b) and dust content (Alatalo et al. 2017;Smercina et al. 2018;Li et al. 2019) despite their lack of on-going star-formation. Thus gas removal or exhaustion is not necessary for star-formation suppression in PSBs, but the unresolved nature of most of these studies makes it difficult to determine why the gas is not forming stars.

The optical integral field unit (IFU) survey 'Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory' (MaNGA) has revealed spatially resolved post-starburst regions within galaxies Greene et al. 2021). Chen et al. (2019) differentiate between central and ring post-starbursts depending on where the post-starburst regions reside. Central PSBs (cPSBs) include galaxies with central regions dominated by poststarburst signatures and show evidence of a recent disruptive event such as a major merger, likely leading to global quenching. Ring PSBs (rPSBs) show poststarburst signatures on the outskirts of the galaxythough not necessarily forming a full 'ring', with starformation on-going in the center, potentially due to a disruption of gas fuelling to the outer regions. Chen et al. (2019) show that cPSBs and rPSBs have different kinematic properties and star-formation histories, indicating that these two types of PSBs have distinct origins and are not sequential evolutionary phases. Further, the overall evolution of rPSBs is uncertain as it is unclear whether an rPSB phase leads to global galaxy quenching or if this is a temporary phase and star-formation is re-invigorated in the outskirts.

We analyze a sample of 13 nearby (z < 0.1) poststarburst galaxies with MaNGA and Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) data to characterize the molecular gas and star-formation properties on kpc scales in PSBs. We adopt a flat ΛCDM cosmology with H 0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω m = 0.30, and Ω Λ = 0.70. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the MaNGA and ALMA data and our sample of poststarburst galaxies. Section 3 describes our methods of computing molecular gas masses from the ALMA data and the spectral fitting of the MaNGA IFU data to obtain galaxy properties such as star-formation rates. We present our results in Section 4 and discuss the implications of our results in Section 5.


## OBSERVATIONS AND SAMPLE


### The MaNGA Survey

The MaNGA survey (Bundy et al. 2014) consists of optical IFU observations for 10,000 galaxies with 0.01 < z < 0.15, taken with the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectrograph (Smee et al. 2013;Drory et al. 2015) on the 2.5m Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) as one of three major SDSS-IV programs (Blanton et al. 2017). Each galaxy is covered by 19-127 hexagonal fiber bundles, covering a 12-32 diameter on the sky. The resulting data cubes have a point-spread function with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼2.5 , and have wavelength coverage from 3600-10300Å with R ∼2000. MaNGA observations are calibrated with standard stars observed simultaneously, with an absolute calibration of better than 5% for ∼90% of the wavelength range . Two thirds of MaNGA galaxies belong to the Primary sample with fields of view covering 1.5 times the effective radius (R e ), while the remaining third, the Secondary sample, have coverage out to 2.5 R e . Both samples are selected with a flat stellar mass distribution and have mean physical resolutions of 1.37 and 2.5 kpc for the Primary and Secondary samples respectively. More information on the MaNGA observing strategy, calibration, and survey design can be found in Law et al. (2015); Yan et al. (2015) and Wake et al. (2017).

Throughout this work, we use MaNGA emission line properties and stellar velocities from the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP, Westfall et al. 2019;Belfiore et al. 2019), accessed through Marvin (Cherinka et al. 2019).


### Sample selection

We first selected PSBs from the MaNGA survey in the SDSS data release 15 (DR15), including approximately half of the galaxies in the completed survey of 10,000 galaxies (Aguado et al. 2019). We started with the 68 galaxies in the central and ring PSB sample of Chen et al. (2019) (excluding the irregular PSBs) with additional PSBs from the principal component analysis (PCA) selection method of Rowlands et al. (2018), adding another 25 galaxies, for a total of 93 galaxies. Chen et al. (2019) select post-starburst spaxels with Hδ A > 3Å, W(Hα) < 10Å, and log W(Hα) < 0.23 × Hδ A − 0.46, where Hδ A is the Lick index measuring the amount of Hδ absorption and W(Hα) is the equivalent width of Hα in emission.

PSBs are selected with the PCA method by requiring that the central 0.5R e (the r-band half-light radius) is visually dominated by post-starburst spaxels. This threshold was chosen to capture PSBs selected with other methods, such as the central 3 fiber from SDSS Data Release 7 in Wild et al. (2007), or spatially resolved studies like Chen et al. (2019). With this criterion, we find that 44/4706 DR15 galaxies are PSBs, similar to the 1-3% prevalence of PSBs in the local universe (e.g. Goto et al. 2003;Rowlands et al. 2018). The "eigenspectra", or principal components, are from Wild et al. (2007), and were generated from model galaxies with star-formation histories containing starbursts of various burst mass fractions, durations, and burst times, with simple stellar population templates from . The first principal component (PC1) corresponds to the 4000Å break strength (the D n 4000 index), and the second (PC2) is the excess Balmer absorption over what is expected given the 4000Å break strength. The MaNGA spectrum for each spaxel with stellar velocity uncertainty < 500 km/s is shifted to restframe and projected onto the model-derived principal components to determine the contribution of each. Poststarburst spaxels are identified primarily by their strong Balmer absorption (PC2), as in Rowlands et al. (2018). After the sample selection, we slightly alter the classification boundaries, which we discuss in more detail in Appendix A.

Of the 93 PSBs from the combined Chen et al. (2019) sample and PCA sample, 23 have Dec. < 27 • and are thus observable by ALMA. To estimate the required sensitivity for our CO(1-0) ALMA observations, we used the integrated fluxes from single dish CO(1-0) observations when available. Otherwise, we estimated the gas fraction and molecular gas mass of each galaxy with the mid-infrared Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) colors following Yesuf et al. (2017), or conservatively assumed a gas fraction of 3% when WISE data are not available. We selected 3% as this is a reasonable constraining limit on the gas fraction for PSBs (e.g. French et al. 2018). To limit the integration time, we selected 13 galaxies with required sensitivities > 4 mJy/beam for a 5σ CO(1-0) detection and without previous CO observations of similar kpc scale resolution.

Our spectral fitting results (discussed in Section 3.2) reveal that one galaxy we observe with ALMA, 8939-3703, is a star-forming interloper, despite deep Balmer absorption. We therefore do not consider this galaxy in our main analysis, though we present the ALMA and MaNGA data for this galaxy in Appendix B.

One rPSB in MaNGA, 8955-3701, has similar ALMA CO(1-0) observations as part of the ALMA-MaNGA QUEnching and STar-formation (ALMaQUEST) survey 1 (Lin et al. 2020). We include this galaxy in our final sample for a total of 13 galaxies with 9 cPSBs and 4 rPSBs.

Two galaxies in our final sample are not in the Chen et al. (2019) sample and are selected from the PCA method, 8086-3704, 9088-9102, and the star-forming interloper 8939-3703. A key advantage of the PCA selection is that PC2 includes the excess absorption of all Balmer lines simultaneously, and thus can be applied to spaxels of a much lower S/N than traditional Balmer absorption measurements, such as Hδ absorption. Additionally, emission lines are masked, so our sample does not exclude PSBs with emission lines excited by AGN (Yan et al. 2006(Yan et al. , 2009Wild et al. 2007), shocks (Alatalo et al. 2016a), and younger post-starbursts which have not totally ceased star-formation. Figure 1 shows the SDSS 3-color image, the PCA spaxel classification maps, and excess Balmer absorption for each galaxy in our sample. We compare our spaxel classification maps to the ring and central PSB classifications made by Chen et al. (2019), and find consistent determinations by visual inspection with the exceptions of 8080-3704 and 9194-3702, where the PCA classification shows a central post-starburst morphology, but they are classified as rPSBs in Chen et al. (2019). We classify these galaxies as cPSBs for the remainder of our analysis for consistency with our PCA classification maps. Additionally, 8982-6104 is a ring PSB but the PCA classification was unable to accurately decompose the spectra of a number of central spaxels, potentially due to AGN contamination, or a strong starburst. However, we still identify this as an rPSB, even though the ring quenching region is patchy. We stress that there are a plethora of different post-starburst selection criteria, and no single selection will include all spectra considered as 'post-starburst' (French 2021).

We plot the stellar mass versus redshift and color magnitude diagram of our final sample of 13 galaxies and the parent MaNGA DR15 sample in contours in  aperture correction. We use an uncertainty of 0.15 dex for the integrated stellar masses based on uncertainty estimates from Pace et al. (2019). We also plot the starforming "main-sequence" sample of 12 galaxies from AL-MaQUEST, which have a specific star-formation rate (sSFR) > 10 −10.5 yr −1 (Lin et al. 2022). The mainsequence sample (hereafter star-forming) also excludes the 12 ALMaQUEST galaxies selected specifically for their starburst properties in Ellison et al. (2020), making up the ALMaQUEST starburst sample. The remaining 22 ALMaQUEST galaxies constitute the 'green valley' sample with low sSFRs indicating on-going quenching.

The main sequence galaxies are a convenient comparison sample for our PSBs because of their similar ALMA observations, though we emphasize that the majority of our sample have significantly lower stellar masses. We also note that the spectral fitted stellar masses from Pace et al. (2019) for our post-starbursts are not fully reliable due to the unique and complex starformation histories of PSBs. Hence, we include these total stellar masses not as precise values but as a rough estimate for our sample.

In the color-magnitude diagram shown in Figure 2, our cPSBs tend to be redder than the ALMaQUEST starforming galaxies as we expect for a globally quenching population. Our rPSBs have comparable colors to the star-forming galaxies, as is consistent with their actively star-forming centers.


### ALMA observations

We obtain ALMA 12m array band 3 observations for 13 galaxies (12 PSBs and 1 interloper) in ALMA proposal 2019.1.01136.S (P.I. Rowlands), listed in Table 1. Each observation has four 1.875 GHz wide spectral windows, one covering the redshifted 12 CO(1-0) line with a rest frequency of 115.27 GHz, and the other three covering nearby redshifted CH 3 OH, CN, and HC 3 N lines with rest frequencies of 107.02 GHz, 113.5 GHz, and 100.07 GHz respectively. These observations have minimum baselines of 15 m and a maximum of 314 m (corresponding to configuration C-2) with the exception of 9088-9102, which had a maximum baseline of 440 m. Integration times range from 300 -6400 s. The native velocity resolution is 3 km/s and the native angular resolutions range from 2.5-3 .

The observations were pipeline calibrated and imaged with the Common Astronomy Software Applications package (CASA (ver. 6.4.3), McMullin et al. 2007). We construct data cubes from each spectral window and image the continuum with the tclean task. In each case, we use a circular clean mask centered on the middle of the image (approximately co-incident with the opti-cal center of each galaxy) and with a radius extending slightly beyond the extent of the CO emission. Following the ALMaQUEST survey (Lin et al. 2020), we use a circular restoring beam with a FWHM of 2.5 and specify the pixel size of our millimeter data as 0.5 to match the seeing and pixel scale of the MaNGA data for an optimal comparison between the ALMA and MaNGA data. We use Briggs weighting with a robust parameter of 0.5 and a flux threshold of the 1σ noise level for all data products except the non-CO spectral windows where we use a robust parameter of 2 to maximize sensitivity.

We image the continuum using all four of the spectral windows, flagging out channels from the CO spectral window within 1000 km/s of the redshifted CO(1-0) frequency. We include the entirety of the non-CO spectral windows because we do not detect any non-CO line emission.

We apply continuum subtraction to the galaxies with continuum detections with the CASA task uvcontsub. We image the CO spectral windows with a spectral channel width of 11 km/s. For direct comparison between the CO and MaNGA data, we employ the imregrid task in CASA to match the pixel locations in both images.

We generate integrated CO(1-0) intensity, velocity, and velocity dispersion maps for each galaxy (the moment 0, 1, and 2 maps respectively). We set the velocity bounds of the moment maps based on the width of the CO(1-0) line in the total spectrum within 1.5 R e of each galaxy, as shown in Figure 3. We use the r-band halflight radius from the NSA as R e throughout this work. For the integrated intensity, we do not apply any sigma clipping, while we remove pixels less than the 4σ noise level for the velocity and velocity dispersion maps.

We image the remaining three continuum subtracted spectral windows, centered on CH 3 OH, CN, and HC 3 N lines, with a Briggs robust parameter of 2 in order to maximize the sensitivity of our data, and a similar flux threshold of 1σ and spectral channel width of 11 km/s, using the native beam size. We do not detect these emission lines in any of our galaxies.

Both the imaging and moment map creation follow the methods of the ALMaQUEST survey (Lin et al. 2020), including the use of the MaNGA beam size, allowing for a robust comparison of our sample with their similar observations of star-forming and green valley galaxies. As mentioned in Section 2.2, we include one ring PSB from the ALMaQUEST survey in our sample, 8655-3701. The data for this galaxy is slightly different from the rest of our sample with a lower spectral resolution CO spectral window and a single dedicated continuum spectral window. We image the continuum as above, though with only the single continuum spectral window and the . Left: stellar mass and redshift diagram of our sample of central and ring PSBs, ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies, and the parent MaNGA DR15 sample as gray contours. We use stellar masses from Pace et al. (2019), and see that the majority of our PSB sample have lower masses than the ALMaQUEST star-forming sample. Right: Color-magnitude diagram with the same galaxies plotted. Magnitudes are from the NASA-Sloan Atlas. Errorbars are present for all points but may be smaller than the marker size. Our cPSBs tend to be redder than the star-forming sample while our rPSBs have similar colors.

channels of the CO spectral window at least 1000 km/s away from the expected CO line frequency. We image the CO spectral window in an identical way to the rest of our sample, as our chosen channel width of 11 km/s is equivalent to the spectral resolution of this data. We do not have spectral coverage of the CH 3 OH, CN, and HC 3 N lines for this galaxy. As shown in Table 1, the native beam sizes of our observations tend to be slightly higher than the MaNGA seeing of 2.5 . To ensure that our choice of a smaller restoring beam does not impact our results, we image our data products with the native beam size and find similar results with no systematic offsets. The data cubes with the selected 2.5 restoring beam tend tend to have slightly higher noise levels than in the data cubes imaged with the native restoring beam, up to ∼10% for the cubes with the largest native beam sizes. For consistency, we use the 2.5 restoring beam fluxes and noise maps, which may yield a slight overestimate of our uncertainties.


## METHODS


### Molecular gas masses

We compute molecular gas masses from the integrated CO(1-0) intensity maps with Equation 1, following Bolatto et al. (2013) with a constant, Milky Way conversion factor of α CO = 4.35 M (K km s −1 pc 2 ) −1 , including a Helium correction.
M H2 = α CO * L CO(1)
The value of α CO represents a significant source of uncertainty, especially given that α CO can be as low as 0.8 M (K km s −1 pc 2 ) −1 in extreme environments such as in starburst galaxies (Narayanan et al. 2011). We discuss our results with a variable α CO in Appendix C. We report global CO and continuum properties of our sample in Table 2. More details on the continuum emission and radio detections of our sample are in Appendix F.


### Spectral fitting

To obtain star-formation histories, we fit the optical MaNGA spectra of the PSBs using Bagpipes (Carnall et al. 2018(Carnall et al. , 2019, a fully Bayesian spectral fitting code. We stack all spaxels classified as post-starburst through PCA (Section 2.2) after careful removal of flagged spaxels in MaNGA suffering from foreground stars, dead fiber, or low signal-to-noise ratio. Stacking is performed by simple unweighted summing, and uncertainties are summed in quadrature. We do not correct for the stellar or gas velocities in individual spaxels. To match the spectral sampling rate R ∼ 2000 of MaNGA spectra, we limit our fitted spectral range to rest-frame λ < 7500Å, the limit of the stellar templates from the MILES library (Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011   . CO(1-0) spectra and integrated intensity contours for the 13 PSBs in our sample. The spectra is spatially integrated over 1.5Re. The shaded region shows the spectral integration bounds for the intensity maps. The MaNGA Plate-IFU identifier is boxed in purple for central PSBs and orange for ring PSBs. The CO moment 0 contours correspond to S/N values of 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 30, and are plotted over the SDSS 3-color image. The 1σ noise levels for each galaxy are given in Table 1. The red plus is the optical center of the galaxy, and the red dashed line is the r-band effective radius from the NSA. The yellow circle in the lower left is the ALMA beam size.

Bagpipes uses the 2016 version of the  spectral synthesis models, and assumes the initial mass function from Kroupa (2001). We adopt the two-component star-formation history (SFH) functional form from Wild et al. (2020) designed to describe PSBs:
SFR(t) ∝ 1 − f burst ψ e dt × ψ e (t) t form >t>t burst + f burst ψ burst dt × ψ burst (t)(2)
where t form is the lookback time when the older population began to form, t burst is the time since the peak of the starburst, and f burst is the portion of mass formed during the starburst. ψ e and ψ burst are given by:
ψ e (t) = exp −t τe (3) ψ burst (t) = t t burst α + t t burst −β −1 .
(4) ψ e is the older, exponential decay component and ψ burst is the double power-law starburst component. τ e is the older population's exponential decay timescale. α and β are the declining and increasing timescales of the burst respectively, with larger values corresponding to steeper SFH slopes. t burst is the age of the universe at the peak of the starburst. All times in the above equations are in the age of the universe (i.e. t = 13.8 Gyr is the present).

We implement a two-step metallicity evolution model, which allows for the stellar metallicity of newly formed stars before (Z old ) and after the peak of the starburst (Z burst ) to have independent metallicity levels as motivated by hydrodynamic simulations (Leung et al. in prep.). For dust attenuation, we use the two-component dust law from Wild et al. (2007) with a fixed powerlaw exponent n = 0.7 for the interstellar medium and a steeper power-law exponent for stars younger than 10 Myr of n = 1.3. These young stars are more attenuated than the older ones by a factor η (= 1/µ in Wild et al. 2007, see Equation 3), as they are assumed to be surrounded by their birth clouds. Nebular emission lines and residuals of skyline subtraction (drawing from the catalogue of Hanuschik 2003) are masked during fitting.

We include a Gaussian Process (GP) kernel as an additive model component to help account for correlated systematic errors caused by observational and calibrational problems in the observed frame as well as model-data mismatch from model limitations (stellar templates, assumed SFH etc.) in the rest-frame (see Section 4.3 of Carnall et al. 2019). The kernel employed is a stochastically-driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHOTerm), implemented through the celerite2 python package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2017;Foreman-Mackey 2018). The final model has 18 parameters, with 15 free to vary with priors. The parameter priors are listed in Appendix D. Sampling of the posterior surface is performed with the nested sampling algorithm MultiNest (Feroz & Hobson 2008) and its python interface (Buchner et al. 2014). For detailed implementation of all elements of the model, its testing and potential limitations, see Leung et al. (in prep.).

Due to the recent starbursts dominating the contribution in the observed spectra as a result of their much lower mass-to-light ratio (see Figure 7 of French et al. 2018), the stellar mass formed during the older, preburst component can be underestimated by a small amount, which leads to a slight overestimation in burst mass fraction (f burst ). However, since this affects all PSBs, it is expected to have little qualitative effects on our results (discussed in Leung et al. in prep.).

After fitting, star-formation rates (SFR) are measured as the average across the most recent 10 8 years from the fitted SFHs.

We report the CO properties and spectral fitting results of the PSB regions for each galaxy in our sample in Table 3. All galaxies but one aforementioned interloper (8939-3703) exhibit clear histories of recent starburst and subsequent quenching from from their fitted SFHs, as displayed in Appendix D.


## RESULTS


### Molecular gas morphology

We consider the morphologies of the integrated CO intensity maps shown in Figure 3. Qualitatively, 6/12 of our PSBs have molecular gas morphologies consisting of one central clump with little extended gas at our resolution. At least four of the PSBs with extended gas appear to be tidally disturbed in the optical SDSS imaging: 8083-12703, 8655-3701, 9194-3702, and 9088-9102. The first three are visually classified as post-mergers by Thorp et al. (2019), and the latter is an on-going merger, as seen in the SDSS image. 9088-9102 has many high significance CO line detections separated from the galaxy itself, likely due to a plethora of gas in a dense environment. 9494-3701 has extended gas perpendicular to the disc of the galaxy, potentially indicative of gas expulsion or an outflow.

We fit each CO moment 0 map with a 2D Gaussian. We do not fit two galaxies: 8081-3702 lacks a robust CO detection, and 8085-6104 has two lobes of gas that cannot be adequately represented with a single Gaussian. Of the remaining 11 galaxies with reasonable   Gaussian fits, 4 have major axis sizes consistent with the ALMA beam size within 20%, and 9/11 have major axis sizes consistent within 50% of the beam size. Following Smercina et al. (2022), we compute the fraction of CO flux within a central core, f core , defined as 3σ of the ALMA beam size centered on the Gaussian fit center. We find that 8/11 galaxies have core fractions greater than 50%, and the sample has a mean core fraction of 66%. These high core fractions show that the molecular gas reservoirs in our PSBs are highly concentrated with unresolved centers, consistent with the results of Smercina et al. (2022) who also find high core fractions in PSBs with even higher resolution CO observations. We plot the core fractions versus the physical resolutions of our galaxies in Figure 4. We also compute the core fractions of star-forming ALMaQUEST galaxies, finding 3/12 galaxies have core fractions greater than 50%, and a mean core fraction of 38%. We compare the core fraction distributions of the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies and our PSBs with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and find a p-value p = 0.006, thus the distributions are significantly different.

Overall, at our kpc-scale resolution, our PSBs have more centrally concentrated molecular gas reservoirs than the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies. However, we note that the sample of star-forming galaxies tend to have higher stellar masses and larger optical sizes than our PSBs (see Figure 2), leading to larger physical sizes of central gas reservoirs. Regardless, the central molecular gas reservoirs of our PSBs are compact with sizes . The fraction of total CO line flux within the 3σ beam size, fcore, and the physical resolution of the 2.5 CO beam for our cPSBs in purple, rPSBs in orange, and AL-MaQUEST star-forming galaxies in blue. All galaxies plotted were imaged with the same 2.5 circular beam. Our PSBs tend to have higher core fractions and thus more centrally concentrated CO emission even at similar physical resolutions.

In Figure 5, we plot the CO, stellar, and Hα velocity maps for each galaxy. The CO velocity map is described in Section 2, and is shown only for spaxels with CO S/N > 3. We also require a g-band S/N > 5 per spaxel for the stellar velocity map, and Hα S/N > 3 per spaxel for the Hα velocity map.

We measure the position angle (PA) of each velocity map with the python code PaFit 3 from Appendix C of Krajnović et al. (2006), using the optical center of the galaxy. We only show PAs with 3σ uncertainties less than 45 • . Finally, we subtract the measured systemic velocities from each velocity field. We present the PAs for the CO, stellar, and Hα velocity fields in Table 4. We measure the same PAs for the sample of 12 AL-MaQUEST star-forming galaxies. By eye, a few of the PA fits do not appear to follow the velocity field. This may be the result of imposing a global PA on a velocity field which has a changing PA with radius, as can be seen in the CO emission of 8083-12703.

We find that 5/12 CO-detected PSBs (2 of which are rPSBs) have CO, stellar, and Hα velocity fields with consistent (within 30 • ) PAs. Other PSBs either lack significant CO or Hα rotation (5/13, all cPSBs), or have kinematic misalignments (3/12). 4/12 of our PSBs lack CO rotation entirely, though this may be in part driven by the compactness of the CO detections at our resolution. We also find that the Hα PAs do not always match the CO PAs, with only 5/8 galaxies with reliable PA measurements for both velocity fields agreeing. In contrast, all 12 of the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies have consistent CO, stellar, and Hα PAs.

Visual inspection of many of the velocity fields in Figure 5 shows that a simple global PA does not capture velocity fields with radially dependent PAs or nonasymmetric motions. To better characterize the velocity fields, we use the Radon transform as implemented in Stark et al. (2018). In brief, the Radon transform is a non-parametric method of determining the PA as a function of radius. Stark et al. (2018) use an automated method to classify Radon profiles of velocity fields into 5 classes: constant, asymmetric, inner bend, outer bend, and both inner and outer bends. The various symmetric but non-constant Radon profile classifications (i.e. inner bend, outer bend, and both inner and outer bends) appear to be driven at least in part by a combination of stellar bars, oval distortions, and disk warps, though each of these physical processes may have different Radon profile signatures. Asymmetric Radon profiles may be driven by tidal interactions due to mergers or gas infall for the Hα Radon profiles. We visually classify the stellar and Hα Radon profiles of our PSBs and the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies, shown in Table 4. The majority of galaxies in the PSB and the ALMaQUEST star-forming samples have Radon classifications, though 1-2 galaxies in each sample cannot be classified due to a lack of rotation or spaxels with sufficient S/N. We do not compute the Radon profiles of our CO velocity fields as this method requires relatively complete velocity information over a chosen radius, such as R e , which few of our CO velocity fields satisfy.

Our PSBs are more likely to have asymmetric stellar and Hα Radon profiles than the ALMaQUEST starforming galaxies. Figure 6 shows histograms of the Radon profile classifications for the stellar and Hα velocity fields. We combine the inner bend, outer bend, and inner bend + outer bend classifications into the symmetric bend category as our sample is too small to meaningfully split into these categories, though we emphasize different physical processes likely drive the different types of bends. For the stellar (Hα) Radon profiles, 5/11 (4/11) PSBs have asymmetric profiles, whereas 2/11 (1/11) are asymmetric for ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies. While these results are suggestive, with our small sample sizes these differences are not statistically significant. From Stark et al. (2018), the percentages of asymmetric stellar and Hα profiles in the entire MaNGA DR15 sample are 15.0 +1.7 −1.5 % and 24.4 +2.4 −2.1 % respectively. Our percentage of asymmetric stellar profiles (45 +15 −14 %) is significantly higher from that of Stark et al. (2018) with a p-value of 0.03, whereas the percentage of asymmetric Hα profiles in our sample (36 +15 −13 %) is indistinguishable, with a p-value of 0.19. Finally, 0/4 rPSBs have asymmetric Hα Radon profiles, while 4/8 cPSBs do, but a larger sample is needed to determine if this is a physical difference.

Considering both the stellar and gas kinematics, we can classify our galaxies into three categories: those with asymmetric or non-rotating stellar velocity fields (7/13), those with symmetric stellar rotation but asymmetric or misaligned gas velocity fields (3/13), and those with consistent stellar, CO, and Hα rotation (3/13). In the second category, all three galaxies have constant stellar Radon profiles but either have asymmetric Hα Radon profiles as in 8080-3704 and 8941-3701, or are kinematically misaligned as in 9494-3701. Finally, the galaxies in the last category (8085-6104, 8086-3704, and 8982-6104) have symmetric stellar and Hα Radon profiles, as well as consistent CO, stellar, and Hα PAs. We will discuss potential physical causes for these different kinematic patterns in Section 5.  (5) Hα Radon Class (6)    Overall, the kinematics of our PSBs tend to be more complex than those of the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies, with misalignments and asymmetries being more common. Nearly half of our PSBs (5/12) have CO, Hα, and stellar velocity fields rotating with a consistent position angle, whereas all ALMaQUEST starforming galaxies (12/12) have consistent PAs. Finally, we use the Radon transform to study the rotating stellar and Hα velocity fields and find that asymmetric Radon profiles appear to be more common in PSBs than the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies for both stellar and Hα velocity fields.


### Star-formation and molecular gas properties in context


#### Global properties

Previous single-dish CO observations of PSBs have reported large molecular gas fractions despite the low star-formation rates of these galaxies (French et al. 2015;Rowlands et al. 2015;Alatalo et al. 2016b). In Figure 7, we plot the total molecular gas masses and the total stellar masses from Pace et al. (2019) for our sample and a number of comparison samples. In both panels we plot the de los Reyes & Kennicutt (2019) sample of star-forming galaxies as contours. On the left, we plot the three ALMaQUEST samples: star-forming galaxies (SF), green valley galaxies (GV), and starburst galaxies (SB, Lin et al. 2019Lin et al. , 2020Ellison et al. 2020). On the right, we compare our PSBs to unresolved CO observations of PSBs, including the samples of French et al. (2015) and Rowlands et al. (2015), as well as early-type galaxies from the ATLAS 3D survey Cappellari et al. 2011). For all the plotted samples, we use a constant α CO of 4.35 M (K km s −1 pc 2 ) −1 for consistency. This value of α CO is likely an overestimate for the SB galaxies, so gas masses for this sample can be considered upper limits (Bolatto et al. 2013).

Our PSBs span a range of global molecular gas fractions, from <1% to above 20%. While some of our PSBs have gas fractions similar to or greater than the majority of the de los Reyes & Kennicutt (2019) starforming sample, 4 of our cPSBs have low gas fractions 1%. Other plotted molecular gas studies of PSBs similarly show a wide range of molecular gas fractions, though the greater sensitivity of our observations allows us to measure lower gas fractions down to 1%. We also see that our PSBs tend to have more molecular gas than the early-type galaxies, especially for PSBs with log M * /M > 10.5.


#### Post-starburst regions

The link between star-formation surface density and molecular gas surface density, the Kennicutt-Schmidt re-lation, is empirically supported in a variety of studies and physically motivated (Kennicutt 1998;de los Reyes & Kennicutt 2019). In Figure 8, we plot this relation for the post-starburst regions of our galaxies compared to a variety of other studies. We plot the properties of only the post-starburst regions of our galaxies rather than global properties to investigate the star-formation properties of the post-starburst regions specifically. Given that the kpc-scale post-starburst regions have physical sizes much larger than an average giant molecular cloud for each galaxy, local small-scale variations in the molecular gas distribution will not impact our results. To compute the post-starburst region surface densities, we use the spectral fitted SFR which was measured over the entire post-starburst region and sum the molecular gas masses over the post-starburst region. We divide these by the area of the post-starburst regions, which we measure by multiplying the number of post-starburst spaxels by their inclination-corrected physical surface areas, with inclination values from the NSA. As shown in Figure 4, we are unable to resolve the central molecular gas, thus our measured molecular gas surface densities are effectively lower limits (at least in our cPSBs) as the gas could be significantly more compact than our beam size, as seen in Smercina et al. (2022); Luo et al. (2022).

In Figure 8, we plot the star-formation rate and molecular gas surface densities for our PSBs, the starforming sample of de los Reyes & Kennicutt (2019), and the three ALMaQUEST samples. The ALMaQUEST star-formation rates are computed from the extinctioncorrected Hα emission according to Kennicutt (1998), but only for spaxels classified as star-forming according to the [SII]/Hα vs [OIII]/Hβ diagram (Kewley et al. 2006). de los Reyes & Kennicutt (2019) compute SFRs for their sample with UV fluxes, correcting for dust extinction with IR fluxes. For typical star-forming galaxies, these two SFR indicators are tightly correlated (Hao et al. 2011). For the GV and SB sample, the Hα SFRs may be underestimated in galaxies with large numbers of spaxels with AGN or composite classified spaxels, as any star-formation from these spaxels is neglected.

Compared to the local star-forming galaxies of de los Reyes & Kennicutt (2019), we see that 5/13 of our PSB regions lie significantly below the fitted relation, thus having lower star-formation efficiencies. In particular, 8655-1902 and 8941-3701 are two central PSBs with sizable molecular gas reservoirs that have nearly quenched their star-formation entirely. densities as expected, and occupies a similar region as the green-valley (GV) galaxies, though often with lower gas surface densities.

In Figure 9, we plot the star-formation efficiency (SFE = Σ SFR / Σ M H 2 ) and the molecular gas fraction (f H2 = M H2 / M * ) of the PSB regions and the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies. The majority of our PSBs have similar f H2 as the star-forming galaxies but have suppressed SFEs, though the degree of this suppression varies significantly. One cPSB, 9494-3701, has a particularly low f H2 , potentially indicating that a lack of molecular gas supply is contributing to quenching in this galaxy. We are considering the post-starburst regions of our galaxies rather than global properties, thus within the quenching post-starburst region we find that there is typically still a significant amount of gas forming stars at a suppressed rate. As discussed above, the molecular gas mass surface densities for our post-starburst regions are effectively lower limits, and therefore the plotted SFEs are upper limits.


### Molecular gas and the star-formation history

Observational and theoretical studies have found a negative correlation between the post-burst age of a PSB and the molecular gas fraction (Rowlands et al. 2015;French et al. 2018 ALMaQUEST SF Ring PSBs Central PSBs Figure 9. The star-formation efficiency (SFR / MH 2 ) and molecular gas fraction (MH 2 /M * ) for post-starburst regions (central PSBs in purple, and ring PSBs in orange) and the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies. The downward arrow shows an upper limit in star-formation rate, and the diagonally pointing arrows show an upper limit in MH 2 with constant SFR and M * .

the removal of molecular gas reservoirs after the starburst can provide clues about which physical mechanisms are driving this removal, such as AGN-driven outflows. We plot the molecular gas fraction as a function of the time since starburst, burst mass fraction, and fraction of stellar mass formed in the last Gyr (F 1Gyr ) for our PSB regions in Figure 10. The time since starburst is the lookback time when the peak of the burst occurs, consistent with the definition of t burst in Equation 2 and from Wild et al. (2020).

With our small sample, we do not observe any evolution in molecular gas fraction after the starburst, burst mass fraction, or the fraction of stellar mass formed in the last Gyr. To determine whether any of these correlations are statistically significant, we use Kendall's τ rank correlation coefficient, a non-parametric correlation test which typically yields similar results as Spearman's ρ. As discussed in Feigelson & Babu (2012), this coefficient can be generalized to include upper limits, as is necessary with our CO non-detection. We find no statistically significant correlations between molecular gas fraction and the plotted SFH parameters in Figure 10. However, our sample is small and heterogeneous with both cPSBs and rPSBs, so any correlations may be washed out by the intrinsic scatter of the relation, such as the range of gas fractions before the post-starburst phase. We might expect a correlation between the gas fraction and the burst mass fraction and F 1Gyr if gas removal is driven by an exhaustion of gas reservoirs in the starburst. However, we observe no such correlation, though this may again be due to the small size of our sample.

To determine whether the overall ISM content of our PSBs is evolving, we attempt a similar analysis with HI gas mass measurements from the HI-MaNGA survey (Stark et al. 2021) in Appendix H, but are unable to draw conclusions due to a lack of HI measurements with low source confusion probabilities in our sample.


### Emission line diagnostics

We classify the ionization source of the gas in our galaxies using the Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich diagram (BPT diagram Baldwin et al. 1981) Figure 11 shows both diagrams for each galaxy, along with the ionization source classifications overlaid on the SDSS 3-color image for both diagrams. We require each line to have S/N ≥ 3. We classify AGN spaxels with the BPT diagram as above the Kewley et al. (2001) line, and composite spaxels as below this line but above the  line. In the WHAN diagram, strong and weak AGN spaxels have [NII]/Hα > 0.4 while strong AGN spaxels have W(Hα) > 6Å, weak AGN have W(Hα) > 3Å, and retired spaxels have W(Hα) < 3Å. These retired spaxels are ionized by hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES). With only optical emission lines, it is difficult to unambiguously separate AGN and shock ionization (e.g. Alatalo et al. 2016a;Kewley et al. 2019). However, given the central location of an AGN, off-center AGN-classified spaxels in both diagrams are likely to be ionized from shocks (Kewley et al. 2019).

Three galaxies are dominated by star-forming spaxels in both diagrams: 8083-12703, 8085-6104, and 8086-3704. All three of these galaxies also have off-center BPT composite spaxels and WHAN strong/weak AGN spaxels, a likely sign of shock ionization. Five galaxies are dominated by retired spaxels in the WHAN diagram, corresponding to AGN/composite BPT spaxels: 7964-1902, 8081-3702, 8655-1902, 8941-3701, and 9494-3701. While 8655-1902 does have some central weak AGN spaxels, the diagram shows these spaxels are close to the border with the retired classification, making it difficult to differentiate between these two ionization sources. Finally, the remaining five galaxies have central regions dominated by BPT AGN or composite spaxels and WHAN strong AGN spaxels: 8655-3701, 8982-6104, 8080-3704, 9088-9102, and 9194-3702. The spatial extent of the AGN ionization varies; 8655-3701 consists of almost entirely WHAN strong and weak AGN spaxels, whereas the other galaxies have a central core of WHAN strong AGN spaxels surrounded by a ring of weak AGN spaxels and then retired spaxels. Three of these central AGN galaxies also have isolated islands of off-center WHAN strong AGN spaxels: 8982-6104, 9088-9102, and 9194-3702, which again may be ionized from shocks.

Overall, we find that ionization in 4-5/9 our cPSBs is driven by HOLMES, 3-4/9 by AGN, and star-formation in 1/9, where 8655-1902 is an ambiguous case where HOLMES or a weak AGN could be contributing to central ionization. The percentage of 33-44% cPSB AGN hosts is broadly consistent with previous work that has found that an central supermassive black hole is an AGN for approximately 50% of the post-starburst phase. Finally, 4/9 of our cPSBs show evidence of non-central shock ionization.

As for our rPSBs, 2/4 have central star-formation with non-central shocks, and the other 2/4 are ionized by an AGN. Our small sample of rPSBs similarly has a high AGN fraction. The former two galaxies are rPSBs; this ionization pattern is consistent with the centers of these rPSBs being under typical star-forming conditions with shocks or other energetic processes ionizing and disrupting gas in the outskirts.


## DISCUSSION


### A tumultuous history for post-starbursts

Overall, centrally concentrated molecular gas reservoirs and disturbed stellar kinematics in 7/13 PSBs provide strong evidence that these galaxies have undergone a recent merger. For 8/13 of our PSBs, the majority of the CO emission resides in a central core that is unresolved with our kpc-scale resolution CO observations. Though few other PSBs have spatially resolved CO observations, other studies also reveal highly centrally concentrated molecular gas distributions (Smercina et al. 2022). Even with higher resolution CO observations (down to ∼200 pc spatial resolution) Smercina et al. (2022) are still unable to resolve the central cores containing the majority of the molecular gas in a sample of 6 PSBs. These centrally concentrated CO morphologies are consistent with predictions from . By studying galaxies that have undergone a recent post-starburst phase in the EAGLE simulation, they find that EAGLE PSBs tend to have centrally concentrated molecular gas reservoirs and disturbed kinematics primarily due to mergers disrupting the gas and driving it inwards, sometimes resulting in a starburst or an increase in AGN accretion, both of which deplete molecular gas reservoirs quickly.

Asymmetric or disordered stellar velocity fields further support a merger history for 7/13 of our cPSBs. While kinematic features such as stellar bars, oval distortions, and disk warps (which may also be of merger origin) could lead to symmetric alterations to the stellar velocity fields, tidal interactions from mergers are the most likely cause of stellar asymmetries. These disturbances are not limited to the stellar velocity field, as the molecular gas reservoirs in our 4 of our PSBs lack rotation, indicating that the molecular gas reservoirs themselves are disturbed. Of the 12 ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies, only 2 have stellar velocity fields with asymmetric Radon profiles, and all 12 have consistent CO, stellar, and Hα position angles, in comparison to only 5/12 PSBs. Thus, the kinematics of our PSBs are less orderly and more disturbed than in the AL-MaQUEST star-forming sample, indicating that physical processes disturbing kinematics in our galaxies are more prevalent. Four of our PSBs are visually classified as either post-mergers (8083-12703, 8655-3701, and 9194-3702) by Thorp et al. (2019), or on-going mergers (9088-9102). The stellar Radon profiles of all four of these galaxies are either asymmetric or could not be classified due to a lack of rotation.

A substantial body of work supports gas-rich mergers leading to a starburst and subsequent quenching episode resulting in a PSB phase. In multiple simulations, a majority of PSBs have recently undergone mergers, making them an important formation mechanism Zheng et al. 2020;Lotz et al. 2004). Observationally, PSBs are morphologically disturbed and show tidal features at higher rates than typical star-forming or early-type galaxies (Yang et al. 2008;Sazonova et al. 2021), further supporting a recent merger for at least half of local PSBs.

While mergers may drive the bulk of the observed stellar asymmetries, smaller interactions or outflows may drive star-formation suppression in the 3/12 of our PSBs with symmetrical stellar Radon profiles and misaligned or asymmetric Hα Radon profiles. A minor merger or interaction event could trigger a starburst and the following post-starburst phase (Wilkinson et al. 2018), which could result in the misalignment of the gas without significantly altering the stellar rotation. Alternatively, an outflow could drive a disturbance in the gas while leaving the stellar velocity field intact. Outflows have previously been observed in PSBs (e.g. Alatalo et al. 2011;Smercina et al. 2022;Luo et al. 2022), though the overall prevalence and impact of outflows on post-starburst evolution is not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the primary effect of an outflow is to expel gas from a PSB (e.g. Feruglio et al. 2010;Baron et al. 2017), or if the outflowing gas remains in the galaxy but disturbs the galaxy's gas reservoir, resulting in suppressed star-formation (e.g. Alatalo et al. 2011;Luo et al. 2022).

We find evidence of an outflow ejecting molecular gas from the center in one of our PSBs, 9494-3701. This is an edge-on disk galaxy with constant stellar and Hα Radon profiles, though the Hα PA is misaligned approximately 90 • from the disk, as shown in Figure 5. The CO morphology in Figure 3 shows significant extraplanar gas also perpendicular to the disk which together appear to be a multiphase outflow. However we do not see evidence of this outflow in the CO line profile (Figure 3 Kewley et al. (2001), and the dashed line is from . Right: SDSS 3-color image with star-forming, weak AGN, strong AGN, and retired classified spaxels in teal, brown, pink, and red respectively, alongside the WHAN diagram, W(Hα) versus [NII]/Hα with classification boundaries from Cid Fernandes et al. (2011). potentially because this extraplanar gas is too faint. The low molecular gas fraction (<1%) of the central poststarburst region may indicate that gas expulsion from the central region is contributing to quenching. More investigation is needed to determine whether the outflows are powerful enough to eject the gas from the galaxy, and if the outflow itself is driving the quenching of the galaxy or if another physical process (such as an AGN) drives both the outflow and the central quenching.

It is unclear whether this is an AGN or starburst driven outflow. The WHAN diagram in Figure 11 shows that 9494-3701 is dominated by retired spaxels and is thus ionized primarily by HOLMES. However, given that the duty cycle of AGN is much shorter than the length of a post-starburst phase, it is possible that 9494-3701 previously hosted an AGN that has since shut off. Alternatively, though the current central region starformation surface density in the post-starburst region is very low (log Σ SF R = −4.1M yr −1 kpc −2 ), the recent starburst in this galaxy could have triggered the outflow and since quenched. Other galaxies in our sample with misaligned or disturbed gas kinematics, such as , and 8941-3701 may also have outflows with masses too small to be detected with our CO data. Detailed spectral fitting with high spectral resolution IFU data could provide strong outflow evidence in these galaxies.

Finally, we turn our attention to three galaxies without the signs of stellar or gas kinematic disturbance of the aforementioned galaxies: 8085-6104, 8086-3704, and 8982-6104. In principle, a number of processes could be driving their current post-starburst phases, including minor mergers or interactions, stellar bars, AGN feedback, or environmental processes like ram pressure stripping. While none of these galaxies currently show obvious signs of a merger, 8086-3704 is our oldest PSB with a burst time of 3.0 +0.4 −0.5 Gyr, so it is possible that the gas and stars have settled since a previous merger.

Alternatively, stellar bars could cause our observed centrally concentrated molecular gas reservoirs and starformation suppression. Bars can drive gas inflows, funneling gas inwards to the center of the galaxy (e.g. Regan et al. 1997;Athanassoula et al. 2013;Querejeta et al. 2016). Bars can also suppress star-formation in the disk (e.g. Vera et al. 2016;Kruk et al. 2018), and may lead to increased star-formation in the gas-rich nuclear region (e.g. George et al. 2019).

Only one of our galaxies has a strong bar, 8655-3701. The bar is present in the SDSS image, and the positionvelocity diagram of the CO emission shows the characteristic "X" shape associated with a bar, shown in Appendix E. Salim et al. (2020) find that a rotating bar in NGC 7674, a Hickson compact group galaxy, likely drives turbulence leading to suppressed star-formation in the bar region. While the nucleus of 8655-3701 is strongly star-forming, the ends of the bar are co-incident with post-starburst regions. This quenching morphology is consistent with the rotation of the bar inducing starformation suppressing turbulence as seen in NGC 7674, though these two galaxies reside in very different environments. Higher resolution CO observations that can resolve the scale height of the gas for reliable velocity dispersion measurements are needed to confirm whether the bar is driving turbulence in this galaxy, and whether such turbulence is co-spatial with quenching regions. It is also possible that the WHAN and BPT-classified AGN spaxels away from the center of this galaxy are from shocks which could be driven by the rotation of the bar, as has been observed in other strongly barred galaxies (e.g. Athanassoula 1992).

While it is possible that other galaxies in our sample have weak bars undetected with the SDSS imaging, it is unclear whether a weak bar could drive star-formation suppression to the same extent as a strong bar, though bar length may be more important than bar strength (Fraser-McKelvie et al. 2020;Géron et al. 2021). The three galaxies without signs of kinematic disturbance (i.e. lacking asymmetrical stellar or Hα Radon profiles and having kinematically aligned CO, stars, and Hα), 8085-6104, 8086-3704, and 8982-6104, all have inner bends in their stellar Radon profiles. Stark et al. (2018) found that stellar bars are the primary driver of inner bends in stellar Radon profiles, so a weak bar contributing to star-formation suppression in these galaxies is possible. Figure 9 shows that a substantial fraction of our poststarburst regions have significant gas reservoirs but suppressed star-formation. This result is in good agreement with the global properties of PSBs from previous spatially unresolved studies (Rowlands et al. 2015;French et al. 2018), but with our spatially resolved observations, we are considering only the post-starburst regions of our galaxies. Thus, our extension of this result indicates that within a PSB, there is still a significant amount of gas in the quenching post-starburst region that is stabilized against star-formation. We also see evidence of suppressed star-formation efficiency when comparing our galaxies to other star-forming samples along the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, shown in Figure 8. The majority of our PSBs are below the relation measured by de los Reyes & Kennicutt (2019), with our cPSBs showing an especially large offset despite large molecular gas surface densities. Though the source of this suppression is still unclear, shocks and turbulence driven by AGN feedback can plausibly suppress star-formation.


### Gas stabilization

Shocks can regulate star-formation as their excess kinetic energy makes the gravitational collapse of molecular clouds needed for star-formation more difficult, thus decreasing star-formation efficiency. The suppressive impact of shocks has been observed in a variety of studies, and in AGN host galaxies in particular (e.g. Alatalo et al. 2014;Guillard et al. 2015;Aalto et al. 2015;Alatalo et al. 2015a). Three of our galaxies have significant WHAN-classified star-forming centers with regions of off-center WHAN-classified AGN spaxels, consistent with shock ionization: 8083-12703, 8085-6104, and 8086-3704. Three other galaxies have central AGN with separated off-center regions of AGN spaxels, consistent with AGN driven shocks: 8982-6104, 9088-9102, and 9194-3702. The possible presence of shocks in 6/13 of our PSBs is suggestive, though from our data it is difficult to determine what the source of these shocks is. Half of our shock candidates have AGN, indicating that AGN outflows could contribute to shocks. In other galaxies, it is possible that the AGN has since shut off but the outflows are still creating shocks. Mergers can also lead to shocks, which may be the case in 9088-9102 which is an on-going merger. Finally, star-formation can drive outflows and shocks, as may be in the case of 8083-12703 and 8085-6104. To unravel the impacts of shocks in our galaxies, we first must confirm these galaxies as shock hosts with UV and IR diagnostic lines (Kewley et al. 2019), while higher resolution CO observations will show whether shocked regions display greater star-formation suppression.

Turbulence from a recent merger, outflows, or other dynamic processes such as a stellar bar can also play a suppressive role in star-formation. Smercina et al. (2018) find internal turbulent pressures in 3 PSBs ∼2 orders of magnitude greater than in typical star-forming galaxies, indicating that the extreme ISM conditions in PSBs are important for understanding the suppression of star-formation in these galaxies. To maintain the turbulent pressures in these galaxies, a persistent source of turbulence is required, such as AGN-driven outflows or a changing gravitational potential caused by the resettling of the potential after a merger. Thus, the tidal forces creating the observed asymmetries in the stellar velocity fields of our PSBs (see Section 4.2) may lead to time-varying gravitational potentials which then drive turbulence in the gas, as observed in Arp 220, a dual nuclei merger (Scoville et al. 2017). Time invariant stellar dynamics in bulge-dominated galaxies can also drive turbulence in the gas and suppress star-formation through morphological quenching, resulting in a lack of star-forming dense gas (Martig et al. 2009(Martig et al. , 2013. However, morphological quenching impacts galaxies with low gas fractions (< 5%) and high stellar masses (> 3 × 10 10 M ) (Gensior & Kruijssen 2021), and none of our PSBs satisfy both of these requirements, making it unlikely that morphological quenching is significant in our sample. Lastly, bar-driven quenching has been observed in a variety of studies as discussed in Section 5.1 With kpcscale resolution observations, we lack the spatial resolution to accurately measure the turbulent properties of the molecular gas. Expanding high resolution CO observations to a larger sample of PSBs will shed light on the impact of a turbulent medium on star-formation.

The prevalence of AGN in 5/13 of our PSBs makes AGN feedback an attractive gas stabilization mechanism, though higher resolution observations are needed to test this possibility. We classify 5 galaxies as potential AGN hosts with emission line ratios consistent with AGN in the WHAN diagram in the central region, as shown in Figure 11. For galaxies to quench in simulations, "radio-mode" AGN feedback is typically required to inject energy into gas reservoirs and stabilize them against gravitational collapse (Ciotti et al. 2010). Studies of individual post-starbursts have drawn a connection between radio-mode AGN and star-formation suppression through more subtle means such as small outflows (Alatalo et al. 2015b;Luo et al. 2022). However, the low spatial resolution of our CO and optical IFU data means we cannot resolve small-scale outflows and turbulence. Piotrowska et al. (2021) find that radiatively inefficient AGN feedback drives turbulence and heats the ISM, leading to a decreased SFE. Further, they find that this AGN feedback also heats the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM), thus preventing accretion of cold gas and reinvigoration of star-formation. To confirm these galaxies as AGN hosts, high spatial resolution radio observations or deep X-ray data are needed, though we note that a lack of a radio or X-ray detection does not exclude the presence of an AGN. Other galaxies in our sample may have recently hosted AGN that have shut off, as the duty cycle of AGN activity is much shorter than the PSB phase (Pawlik et al. 2018). Thus, the lack of current evidence for AGN activity does not eliminate the possibility that AGN feedback is important in regulating star-formation in our entire sample, as found in Piotrowska et al. (2021). High resolution, multiwavelength observations are needed to determine the galactic-scale processes suppressing star-formation and to study the impacts these mechanisms have on the cloud-scale ISM conditions governing star-formation.


### Central and ring post-starbursts

Overall, it is difficult to distinguish the quenching mechanisms active in ring and central PSBs with our data and small sample. Chen et al. (2019) find that cPSBs have a more dramatic history, while rPSBs with star-forming centers may be quenching due to gas supply cutoff in the outskirts. Morphologically, cPSBs and rPSBs have similar mean core fractions (67% and 65% respectively, see Figure 4). Both cPSBs and rPSBs show asymmetrical stellar Radon profiles (3/7 and 2/4 respectively), and both samples include galaxies with kinematic misalignments (6/9 cPSBs and 1/4 rPSBs). Both central and ring post-starburst regions show evidence of star-formation suppression, though to a lesser degree for the ring post-starburst regions than some central regions, as shown in Figures 8 and 10. Finally, both samples have a significant portion of central AGN ionization (3/9 for cPSBs and 2/4 for rPSBs). The two rPSBs without central AGN spaxels instead appear to be ionized by shocks in the outskirts of the galaxy with star-formation dominating the central ionization, similar to 8086-3704, a cPSB. Overall, it appears that both cPSBs and rPSBs often have undergone a recent merger, given the high rate of stellar asymmetries and centrally concentrated molecular gas in both samples.

The natural question that arises is why do some mergers appear to lead to a central PSB whereas others lead to a ring PSB? Mergers can take many different forms with varying stellar mass ratios, gas fractions, and orientations all playing significant roles. More theoretical work is needed to determine the qualities that lead a merger remnant to a cPSB versus an rPSB phase. One area where we observe a difference between our cPSBs and rPSBs is in the gas kinematics. In Figure 6, we see that 4/8 cPSBs have asymmetric Hα Radon profiles, while 0/4 rPSBs do. Similarly, looking at the CO velocity maps in Figure 5, 4/8 CO-detected cPSBs lack significant CO rotation, whereas all 4 rPSBs have strong CO rotation (though it is misaligned in one case). While the small sample of our rPSBs makes any conclusions tentative, it appears that the gas in rPSBs is less disturbed than in cPSBs, potentially from a less disruptive merger or from a faster resettling of the gas. It is also possible that the highly disturbed gas in cPSBs is driven by a process more commonly active in cPSBs, such as outflows.

Our conclusion that mergers are important in the formation of both cPSBs and rPSBs is consistent with Chen et al. (2019). With the addition of our spatially resolved CO observations, we find that the gas appears to be less disturbed in rPSBs, showing stronger rotation and more symmetrical velocity maps. Chen et al. (2019) differentiate between two types of rPSBs, those that are experiencing a global shutdown of star-formation, and those with star-forming centers. They conclude that the former group may be quenching from a lack of gas inflow, while the latter likely have experienced either ram pressure stripping or a merger/interaction. Owers et al. (2019) also identify galaxies with central star-formation and post-starburst signatures in the outskirts, though they find these galaxies almost exclusively in a cluster context, and conclude that the outer poststarburst regions are driven by ram-pressure stripping. Our rPSBs similarly have star-forming centers and outer post-starburst regions. However, the post-starburst regions in our rPSBs have similar gas fractions to the central post-starburst regions and ALMaQUEST starforming galaxies, indicating that a lack of molecular gas is not driving quenching. The primary difference Chen et al. (2019) find between their cPSBs and rPSBs are in their star-formation histories and rotational support, where cPSBs have a more mixed-age stellar population throughout the galaxy, and also have less rotational support, both of which indicate a recent dramatic event such as a merger. Our results show stellar disturbances in both cPSBs and rPSBs, indicating a common merger origin, but the molecular and ionized gas in cPSBs appears to be more disturbed than in rPSBs, hinting at the importance of gas disruption through processes such as outflows.

It is tempting to point towards rPSBs as outside-in quenching systems and cPSBs as inside-out quenching systems, but this simplistic picture has a number of flaws. It is unclear whether rPSBs can truly be considered "quenching" systems, as their evolution is unknown: will the outskirts of these galaxies eventually undergo re-invigoration of their star-formation, or is an rPSB phase the first step towards outside-in quenching? To answer this question, a larger sample of rPSBs is needed with a range of post-burst ages, as well as an improved theoretical understanding of how rPSBs form and evolve. IFS studies of cPSBs have enabled measurements of radial gradients in stellar populations. Chen et al. (2019) find that the outskirts of cPSBs show weaker post-starburst signatures than the central regions, indicating that these regions either never underwent a starburst or that the burst was weaker or older. Zheng et al. (2020) use binary merger simulations to measure radial gradients in cPSBs and find that the starburst peaks at the same time throughout the galaxy, but is more prolonged and stronger in the center, leading to the observed radial gradients in Chen et al. (2019). In our sample, one of our cPSBs, 8941-3701, has a central post-starburst region and the outskirts of the galaxy are quiescent but not post-starburst, which is consistent with outside-in quenching. More detailed spatially resolved spectral fitting on a larger sample will show whether this qualitative outside-in behavior is typical.


## CONCLUSIONS

In this work we present ALMA CO(1-0) observations of 13 post-starburst galaxies with accompanying MaNGA optical IFS data, 9 of which have central poststarburst regions and 4 with ring outskirt post-starburst regions. With these data, we study the molecular gas morphology, kinematics, and star-formation properties of these galaxies to work towards understanding the causes and mechanisms of star-formation quenching in these galaxies. We list our primary conclusions below:

1. The majority of our PSBs show evidence of a recent merger. 7/13 PSBs have asymmetric or non-rotating stellar velocity fields, consistent with tidal forces from a merger or interaction disrupting the stellar kinematics. The remaining six galaxies lack kinematic evidence of a recent merger. While mergers resulting in symmetric stellar disturbances (such as a disk warp) and minor mergers are not ruled out, other processes such as outflows and weak stellar bars may play a role in the quenching of these galaxies, as we see in outflow host 9494-3701.

2. Significant molecular gas reservoirs in poststarburst regions are stabilized against starformation. Within the post-starburst regions of our galaxies, we find typical molecular gas fractions but low star-formation efficiencies in nearly half of our sample. PSBs then do not typically quench due to a lack of molecular gas but because the existing gas is not forming stars. AGN feedback may drive this stabilization, with 5/13 galaxies hosting central AGN-like emission.

3. Central and ring post-starburst regions have similar properties, though gas in rPSBs may be less disturbed. The post-starburst regions of our central and ring PSB regions have similar starformation and molecular gas properties. Both samples have approximately half of galaxies with evidence of mergers (3/7 cPSBs and 2/4 rPSBs). However, both the ionized and molecular gas in rPSBs appears to be less disturbed than that of the cPSBs, which may hint at different merger conditions or another process primarily impacting cPSBs, such as outflows.

We show the classification boundaries for the PCA analysis in Figure 12. The boundaries differ for low and high mass spaxels (defined as above and below M * = 10 10 M ) as PC1 and PC2 values have a weak stellar mass dependence. We modified the original boundaries from Rowlands et al. (2018) visually to optimize the agreement between the PCA method and the Chen et al. (2019) selection method while minimizing contamination. We plot all spaxels from the final Chen et al. (2019) and PCA combined sample in Figure 12, and color spaxels identified as post-starburst by Chen et al. (2019) in green according to their Hδ A value. In the high mass case, all Chen et al. (2019) PSB-classified spaxels are also PSB-classified with the PCA method, though for spaxels in low stellar mass galaxies there is overlap with the star-forming classification region.

Different post-starburst selection methods result in samples with different properties including post-burst ages and AGN or shock presence, and no single selection will include all galaxies considered to be post-starburst. As mentioned in Section 2.2, our spectral fitting results of 8939-3703 indicate that this galaxy is a star-forming interloper. We plot the star-formation history of this galaxy in Figure 15, where we see relatively constant starformation over the last ∼3 Gyr. Since the residuals are in line with Gaussian random noise and the fitted Gaussian process term is well behaved, the optical continuum for this galaxy is well fit. The derived SFH indicates that there is little evidence in the continuum that a recent starburst nor rapid quenching occurred in the PSB spaxels.

This galaxy is selected as a PSB using the PCA method of Rowlands et al. (2018), though we note it is not selected in the sample of Chen et al. (2019). Figure 13 shows the SDSS 3-color image, the PCA spaxel classifications, and the excess Balmer absorption of 8939-3703. The high values of excess Balmer absorption mean that many spaxels in this galaxy are not close to the PSB classification boundary in D n 4000 and Balmer absorption space (principal components 1 and 2 respectively in our PCA analysis). In the optical image we do see that a foreground star is close to the galaxy.  Rowlands et al. (2018), with post-starburst spaxels in purple, star-forming spaxels in blue, and starburst spaxels in teal. The green circle shows the MaNGA 2.5 average seeing. This galaxy is clearly classified as a PSB.

However, there is no visible diffraction spike in the MaNGA data and all the quality flags indicate this star did not contaminate the data.

We do not detect any CO(1-0) emission from this galaxy with ALMA. We measure an upper limit molecular gas mass of log M H2 /M < 7.7.


## C. DIFFERENT VALUES OF α CO

Observationally, Smercina et al. (2018) find that an α CO of 4 M (K km s −1 pc 2 ) −1 was generally in agreement with molecular gas masses derived from fitting multiple H 2 rotational emission lines for a sample of E+A galaxies. However, their requirement of W(Hα) < 3Å for their sample would likely exclude 8/13 galaxies in our sample, so we investigate the impact of a varying α CO on our results.

The unique ISM conditions in PSBs makes determining the proper conversion from CO line flux to molecular gas mass, i.e. α CO difficult. Primary factors that can alter α CO include metallicity and the galactic environment -often including starbursting galaxies and mergers (e.g. Bolatto et al. 2013). Narayanan et al. (2012) combine these two impacts in a single prescription for α CO :
α CO = min[6.3, 10.7 × W CO −0.32 Z 0.65 (C1)
Where W CO is the CO surface brightness measured in K km/s, and Z is the gas-phase metallicity normalized by the Solar metallicity. While we directly measure the CO surface brightness, determining the gas-phase metallicity is difficult in the non star-forming spaxels of our PSBs, though work is being done to extend metallicity relations to LI(N)ER regions (Kumari et al. 2021). Goto (2007) find that the metallicities of a sample of 451 E+A are consistent with solar metallicities. Given that AGN appear to be present in about 4 of our galaxies (see Section 4.5) and would not be included in the E+A sample of Goto (2007), we also consider that the typical metallicity of AGN hosts can range from near-solar values to up to a few times solar metallicity (e.g. Hamann et al. 2002). We conservatively assign a metallicity of two times solar (i.e. Z = 2) for our sample and compute new α CO values for our post-starburst regions. The mean α CO of our post-starburst regions using Equation C1 is 1.9 M (K km s −1 pc 2 ) −1 , which is within a reasonable uncertainty of a Milky-Way α CO of 4.35 M (K km s −1 pc 2 ) −1 of a factor of a few. Alternatively, if our PSBs were to have a sub-solar metallicity of Z = 0.5, we find a mean α CO = 4.75 M (K km s −1 pc 2 ) −1 , thus slightly increasing our measured gas masses, but well within our uncertainties. A sub-solar metallicity could be achieved from pristine gas inflow.

In Figure 14, we plot the gas fraction and star-formation efficiency of our post-starburst regions (as in Figure 9) but with the variable α CO computed with Equation C1, assuming Z = 2. Though the gas fractions are lower and star-formation efficiencies higher than with the Milky Way α CO in Figure 9, our primary conclusion that the many of our post-starburst regions have similar molecular gas fractions to the star-forming galaxies with lower star-formation efficiencies still holds.   Table 5. Model priors used for spectral fitting of stacked PSB-only spaxels. The star-formation history parameter symbols are described in equations 2 to 4; the Gaussian process parameter symbols are described in Foreman-Mackey et al. (2017); Foreman-Mackey (2018) and Leung et al. (in prep.). Other symbols have their usual meanings. A log 10 uniform prior form indicates a flat prior in log(X) ∼ U (log(min), log(max)). Redshift is given a uniform prior from 80% to 120% of the target's catalog value.

D. FITTING STAR-FORMATION HISTORIES Table 5 lists the 18 parameters in the final SFH model, with 15 free to vary with priors. The parameters are described in Section 3.2. Figure 15 shows our derived SFH's for each galaxy in our sample. The spectral fitting methods used are described in Section 3.2. SFH parameters such as the time since burst, burst mass fraction, etc are listed for each galaxy in Table 3.  Tables 5 and 3. 8939-3703, highlighted with red text, is found to be a star-forming interloper (see Appendix B). The bottom x-axis traces age of the universe, with the corresponding redshift scale displayed on the top edge, while the y-axis shows star-formation rates. The star-formation histories grow progressively more uncertain with greater lookback time.


## E. POSITION-VELOCITY DIAGRAMS

In Figure 16, we plot the CO position-velocity (P-V) diagram for each galaxy with a CO detection. We select the axis along which we extract the P-V diagram by hand with a width of 1 . We see that 6 galaxies have rotating CO emission, though these galaxies do not have a flattening of their rotation curves at larger radii, possibly as a result of the centrally concentrated gas morphologies. One galaxy has a bar, 8655-3701, as shown by the "X" shape in the P-V diagram. This galaxy also has an obvious stellar bar in the optical image. Finally, the P-V diagram of 8083-12703 shows a complex kinematic structure with a radius-dependent kinematic position angle, which may be indicative of some disturbance such as a minor merger or interaction.

F. 3MM AND RADIO CONTINUUM DETECTIONS Radio and millimeter continuum detections can be associated with an AGN or a starburst (e.g. Best et al. 2005). We detect 3mm continuum emission to 5σ in 7/13 of our PSBs. For each galaxy, this emission is unresolved and in the center of the galaxy except for 9088-9102, which has extended continuum emission in the center, and 9494-3701, which has continuum emission offset from the center.

We measure radio fluxes of our galaxies from cutouts from the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS, Lacy et al. 2020) and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters survey (FIRST, Becker et al. 1994) at the optical source locations of our galaxies. We first fit the cutouts with a 2D Gaussian, and measure fluxes within an elliptical aperture corresponding to the 3σ Gaussian fit size. We measure 4 galaxies with S/N > 3 from the FIRST survey, and 3 from VLASS. We show the 3 mm continuum contours for galaxies with a 5σ continuum millimeter or radio detection, overlaid on the 3-color SDSS image in Figure 17. For galaxies with radio continuum detections, the emission is co-incident with the millimeter continuum emission.

For the majority of 3mm continuum detected galaxies, AGN likely contribute to the 3mm emission, though starformation may also contribute significantly as a dust heating source and through free-free emission. Of the 7 galaxies with 3mm continuum emission, 5 have central emission line ratios consistent with some AGN contribution (see Section 4.5). 8083-12703 is an rPSB with 3mm emission and no evidence of a central AGN but does have a star-forming center, indicating that the central, compact 3mm emission could be from a central starburst. The extended nature of the 3mm emission in 9088-9102 also points towards a significant contribution from star-formation, as we would expect continuum emission heated by a central AGN to be highly compact. Lastly, the offset of the continuum emission of 9494-3701 and optical center of the galaxy indicates that this emission may be from a background source rather than from within the galaxy itself. None of the 12 ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies have 3 mm continuum detections.


## G. HALF-LIGHT RADII

We use the statmorph python code to measure the half-light radii of the CO emission for our PSBs and the starforming ALMaQUEST galaxies (Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2019). We use the half-light radius to measure the overall extent of the CO rather than the central core size measured by the 2D Gaussian fit. We input a segmentation map of the largest contiguous region of spaxels with 3σ CO detections. We plot the CO and r-band half light radii in Figure 18. Galaxies with f core ≥ 50% are upper limits because at least half of their CO emission is unresolved. While some of our PSBs cannot be distinguished from the star-forming galaxies due to loosely constraining CO size upper limits, we see that the molecular gas of PSBs is at least as compact as the most compact ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies, relative to the r-band effective radius.


## H. HI GAS PROPERTIES

We investigate the HI properties of our sample with data from the HI-MaNGA survey (Stark et al. 2021), a MaNGA follow-up survey of HI observations with the Green Bank Telescope. We only include galaxies which have a source confusion probability less than 10%. Of our 13 PSBs, 10 were observed (the other three are outside the redshift cut of z < 0.05), and 6/10 were detected. Only 2/6 detected PSBs have sufficiently low confusion probabilities, 7964-1902 and 8085-6104. We plot the HI gas fractions (M HI /M * ) and H 2 to HI mass ratio for our PSBs and the ALMaQUEST star-forming galaxies in Figure 19. We also show the measured HI gas fraction and stellar mass double power law relations for late-type galaxies (LTGs) and early-type galaxies (ETGs) from Calette et al. (2018). The two HI-detected PSBs have similar HI gas fractions as the star-forming galaxies, and similar H 2 to HI mass ratios. One PSB, 9494-3701, with an HI mass upper limit has a low HI gas fraction consistent with the ETGs of Calette et al. (2018). With only 2 HI detections in our sample, higher resolution HI observations are needed to understand the atomic gas content of our PSBs, especially those with nearby galaxies where source confusion is an issue.

We use stellar masses from Pace et al. (2019), and see that the majority of our PSB sample have lower masses than the ALMaQUEST star-forming sample. Right: Color-magnitude diagram with the same galaxies plotted. Magnitudes are from the NASA-Sloan Atlas. Errorbars are present for all points but may be smaller than the marker size. Our cPSBs tend to be redder than the star-forming sample while our rPSBs have similar colors.
