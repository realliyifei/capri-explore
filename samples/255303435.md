## Introduction

Granuloma annulare (GA) is a benign, inflammatory skin disorder with an annualized incidence of 0.04% and a prevalence of 0.06%. It is most frequent during the fifth decade of life, with a predilection for Caucasian women (F: M ratio of about 3:1) [1]. Although uncertain etiology, it could represent a hypersensitivity reaction to triggers such as trauma, medications, malignancy, viral infections, and vaccinations [2]. Clinically, GA presents with localized, generalized, subcutaneous and perforating forms. It appears as one or more self-regressing erythematous papules that tend to form annular or arciform plaques, localized mainly on the dorsum of hands and feet or over the trunk.

Histologically, mainly GA presents a palisading pattern, characterized by a central zone of necrobiotic collagen surrounded by palisading histiocytes and varying numbers of lymphocytes, and an interstitial pattern, characterized by histiocytes and lymphocytes distributed between collagen bundles and around vessels with an increased amount of connective tissue mucin [3,4].

During the recent Cov-19 pandemic, four documented cases of GA, one after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and three after SARS-CoV-2 infection, have been reported [2,[5][6][7][8].

This report presented the second documented case of GA after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and, after briefly mentioning post-CoV-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reactive skin manifestations reported in the literature, reviewed all the GA correlated to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and infection.


## Case presentation

In May 2022, a 69-year-old woman presented to the Dermatologic Unit of the University of Naples "Federico II with a 20-day before-onset asymptomatic reddish lesion on her left arm. The patient referred the lesion formed 7-days following the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA BNT162b2 on the injection site, daily enlarged for up to 10 days and failed to respond to the topical corticosteroids. The lesion was about 1,5 cm in diameter and composed of multiple papules forming a plaque (Fig. 1A). Dermoscopy revealed linear arborizing vessels on a whitish-red background (Fig. 1B). Suspecting GA, the clinicians performed a 5-mm punch biopsy. Histology and subsequent immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence, in the dermis, of an interstitial inflammatory infiltrate, mainly composed of histiocytes with some giant multinucleated cells and an accompanying perivascular lymphocytic population consisting primarily of T-cells ( Fig. 2A-D). These findings led to the diagnosis of interstitial GA. At the 3-month follow-up, the lesion showed signs of resolution.


## Discussion

During the Cov-19 pandemic, many studies reported a wide spectrum of cutaneous reactions after both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18].

The most common skin manifestations are erythematous rashes, with mostly a maculopapular, pityriasis rosea-like and erythema multiformelike pattern and vascular diseases, including the most peculiar chilblainlike lesions (also known as COVID-toes, pernio-like lesions, or pseudochilblain). Urticaria-like, vesicular/bullous and livedo-necrosis were also described.

Current evidence shows that most cutaneous reactions secondary to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are like those associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and share immunopathological mechanisms, including host immune activation against viral particles rather than direct viral damage [14,19].

Some authors hypothesized that the cutaneous damage might start with dysfunction of endothelial cells caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or by immune system activation [20]. Pathophysiologically, skin lesions may be provoked by inflammatory mechanisms, including immune response to viral nucleotides, and vascular mechanisms, secondary to vasculitis or vasculopathy, and thrombosis [21]. The exaggerated inflammatory response is linked to the triggering of innate and adaptive immune responses and to the monocytic-macrophage system [22]. Some erythematous skin rashes may result from other viral infections that can occur in cases of drug reactions [23] or an adverse drug reaction used during SARS-CoV-2 infection [24]. In chilblains-like lesions, the most studied vascular disease, an exaggerated immune response with significant type 1 interferon signaling necessary for viral eradication would generate a generalized inflammatory response [25,26].

GA arising both after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination are exceptional and unexpected events: three cases of GA after SARS-CoV-2 infection and one after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported in the literature (Table 1) [2,[5][6][7][8].

In detail, the first patient was a 53 years-old woman with an annular lesion on the second finger on the left hand and a papule on the knuckle of the same finger, arising at the same time with the onset of SARS-CoV-2 typical symptoms (dysgeusia, anosmia and headache) and a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2.

Histology showed an interstitial GA [5]. Later, the authors reported positive immunohistochemical staining for the viral spike protein in the cytoplasm of histiocytes of this lesion and the negativity of the RT-PCR on a fresh skin biopsy performed two months after the first one [6].

The second patient was a 31 years-old woman with an annular, irregular, pink-colored erythematous 3 × 2 in diameter papular lesion on the dorsum of the left foot, arising ten days after an RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Histology revealed an interstitial GA [7].

The third patient was a 63-year-old male with abrupt onset, multiple, asymptomatic, skin-colored to erythematous nodules involving abdomen, bilateral upper and lower limb, arising twenty days after a positive rapid antigen test for SARS-Cov-2. Histopathology was consistent with generalized and subcutaneous GA [8].

The first described patient with GA after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was a 58 years-old woman presented to the clinicians because of a 3month-rash localized at the trunk and extremities, manifested two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The treatment produced a clinical improvement after one month. Nevertheless, less than a week after the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 booster dose, the patient showed new lesions, increased itching, and redness of her rash [2].

In our case, the patient developed a reddish lesion seven days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and in the same site with a histological finding of interstitial GA. The patient is under constant routine follow-up and is well and without lesions.

Furthermore, three inflammatory skin lesions resembling systemic GA cases have been described in three SARS-CoV-2 swab-negative adolescents [27]. The patients were two boys between 11 and 14 years old and an 11 years-old girl, and all of them showed acral nodular lesions with histological findings of chronic immune-mediated inflammation and immunohistochemical evidence of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in endothelial cells and eccrine sweat glands. Moreover, after a few months, serological tests were carried out and showed positivity for IgG, suggesting the possibility of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection as a triggering event for the SGA.

The pathogenetic mechanism underlying these events has yet to be well established. The most plausible hypothesis proposed argues that the cause is to be found in the immune reaction triggered by vaccination and associated infections rather than by the direct role of the virus on the skin lesion. This hypothesis is reinforced by the description of GA in patients recently underwent other vaccinations, mainly Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) [2,28]. Furthermore, the key role of upregulation of the T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 pathways in the onset of GA has recently been described. In addition, the key role Th17 and Th22 axes and the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK--STAT) pathway were upregulated [29].


## Conclusion

We find this case of GA instructive because of the remarkable exceptionality: in fact, it represents the second case of GA arising after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; even though it cannot be ruled out a coincidental association, the time relationship between the vaccination and the onset of GA supports a causative association. Together with the other cases we reviewed here, it may help us to confirm that GAs, some of which recently described in patients underwent other vaccinations, may occur due to a severe immune system activation caused by vaccination.

In dermatopathological practice, it should be aware of the potential, though rare, of GA as a possible adverse event after vaccination, including the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Anyway, colleagues should encourage patients to obtain the vaccination in order to assist the public health systems to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.
