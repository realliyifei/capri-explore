Using Natural Language Processing and Networks to Automate Structured Literature Reviews: An Application to Farmers Climate Change Adaptation
Natural Language Processing · Networks · Literature Re- view · Interpretative
The fast-growing number of research articles makes it problematic for scholars to keep track of the new findings related to their areas of expertise. Furthermore, linking knowledge across disciplines in rapidly developing fields becomes challenging for complex topics like climate change that demand interdisciplinary solutions. At the same time, the rise of Black Box types of text summarization makes it difficult to understand how text relationships are built, let alone relate to existing theories conceptualizing cause-effect relationships and permitting hypothesizing. This work aims to sensibly use Natural Language Processing by extracting variables relations and synthesizing their findings using networks while relating to key concepts dominant in relevant disciplines. As an example, we apply our methodology to the analysis of farmers' adaptation to climate change. For this, we perform a Natural Language Processing analysis of publications returned by Scopus in August 2022. Results show that the use of Natural Language Processing together with networks in a descriptive manner offers a fast and interpretable way to synthesize literature review findings as long as researchers back up results with theory.

# Introduction

The fast expansion of research articles hinders researchers from keeping track of the emerging findings in their areas of expertise [13]. While systematic literature reviews are labor-intensive, the median time for them to go outdated is 5.5 years [22]. Given the current pace of publishing, it is increasingly challenging to cover the escalating pool of articles and to monitor the latest developments in a particular field. Automated content analysis [18] and extractive text summarization systems [5] have been argued as key tools to support literature synthesis and to keep track of research trends.

Automated content analysis for literature reviews commonly aims to map text into topics using the articles' abstracts. [18] show how automated content analysis can synthesize big volumes of literature's abstracts from ecology and evolutionary biology. In the Climate Change domain, [7] use machine learning and experts evaluations to map key messages relevant to climate change mitigation using around 100,000 articles' abstracts related to demand-side mitigation. Regarding climate change adaptation, [14] use the abstracts and metadata from around 7000 articles to map the evolution of climate change adaptation science across time.

Text summarization systems are normally used for more in-depth literature reviews that use the full articles' text. In this context, a summarization system takes a predefined set of documents and generates a summary, which can be extractive (the system extracts and ranks the sentences from the original text) or abstractive (the system extracts knowledge from the original text and reconstructs them into a new piece) [26]. In this sense, [26] offers a systematic review of the different methodologies for Electronic Health Records and biomedical literature summarizations. Based on their systematic review, 83% of the articles analyzed used at least the full text as input. As summary output, 81% of the articles adopted an extractive approach, while 17% of the articles used an abstractive approach -the remaining 2% compared both outputs. However, automated content analysis and extractive text summarization systems stem from machine learning and deep learning methodologies, commonly referred to as Black Box. This is because they make it difficult to theorize based on their results and to understand how text relationships are built [4,20]. As they tend to rank and re-organize the text, which hinders interpretation. On the one hand, this hinders the understanding of the role of the extracted piece in the sentence [26]. On the other hand, they might contain redundant information, which may result in a deficiency of information [26]. Furthermore, these methodologies can also suffer from opacity [6], namely opacity in terms of what text features the algorithm relied on to perform classifications. This leads to calls to stop using Black Box methodologies in favor of interpretable algorithms [20] grounded in theory and that use tailored databases, as opposed to trained over all the data found in the web [4].

In this work, we argue that using Natural Language Processing (NLP) descriptively (as opposed to predictively) offers interpretable methodologies to perform literature reviews when the results are sensibly visualized using networks. On the one hand, NLP is a range of computational techniques whose main goal is to provide machines with the capability to understand natural language by understanding its semantics. This means that "the machine understand[s] not just the statistical properties but also the meaning and context of, say, a certain word" [11, p. 2]. On the other hand, in its simplest form, a network is a collection of points (nodes) joined together in pairs by lines (edges). In research, many systems can be represented as networks, for example, the internet, social interactions, and collections of computers. Network analysis can be done through their different structures, properties, and metrics that can help uncover system patterns [16].

The joint use of NLP and networks to summarize text has been done in the past. In their pioneering work [22] use NLP and networks to generate visual overviews of unstructured text from novels and blogs to investigate different research questions, such as "Who was involved in the debate about competing scientific ideas?" In more recent work, [23] use NLP and networks to provide insights on policy and scientific discourse around Sustainable Development Goals. In their network, they use NLP to identify topics in the text and then build the network using nodes to represent the topics and edge weights to represent the cosine similarity between the topics. However, to our knowledge, networks haven't been used to generate visual overviews of literature reviews.

In this work, we propose a methodology based on NLP and network visualization to summarize articles' findings in a descriptive and interpretable manner. In the rest of the article, first, we explain the articles database to which we will apply our NLP-supported literature review. Second, we introduce our NLPsupported literature review algorithm, and apply it to the articles database. Third, we explain the logic behind the network visualization and use it to visualize the results from the NLP-supported literature review. Fourth, we wrap up with the conclusions. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future work.


# Application to Farmers Adaptation to Climate Change

This section introduces the articles database to which we will apply our NLPsupported literature review. The articles' database focuses on drivers of farmers' adaptation to climate change. In the literature, there are some reviews on what the agricultural farmers' adaptation measures are [2,3,21]. But, there is still a gap in the literature regarding what factors motivate farmers to adapt. In this application, we aim to shed some light on the factors that motivate agricultural farmers (hereafter called farmers) to follow climate change adaptation measures.


## Data

Our data was retrieved from Scopus [9] during the first week of August 2022. We derived the data from articles retrieved from SCOPUS in an inclusive manner. This means that initially, we did not constrain the search to only farmers. Instead, we downloaded all the articles about human adaptation to climate change belonging to the categories: Multidisciplinary, Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Environmental Science.

To derive the data from articles retrieved from SCOPUS, we followed six steps. First, we searched for articles related to adaptation to climate change using related search terms, such as "climate change", "social change", "regime shift", etc. This resulted in 30,000 unique articles. Second, we clustered the articles into ten different categories using unsupervised learning. Third, we categorized 5% of the articles in each category as relevant or irrelevant to the study of climate change adaptation using ASReview [8]. This gave us a labeled database of 1600 articles. Fourth, using the results from the 5% categorization, we trained a classifier to categorize the rest of the articles in the database. This resulted in 2438 articles classified as related to human adaptation to climate change. Five, we validated the articles were about human adaptation to climate change and that they talked about the possible drivers by checking all the abstracts from the articles. Finally, we kept only those related to farmers' adaptation to climate change from the resulting articles. This means we looked for those that contained the words "farmer" or "agriculture" in either the title or the abstract. Our final database consists of around 276 articles that were written between the years 2005 and 2022. Figure 1 shows the articles' distribution by year and Scopus area. 


# Methodology: General Overview of the Algorithm

We build upon [5] extractive text summarization system to perform the NLPsupported systematic literature review. In this work, we followed [5] first six steps and, at the end, introduced three new ones ( Figure 2): 1) PDF Text Extraction; 2) Text Classification and Filtering; 3) Text Normalization; 4) IMRAD Context Detection; 5) Sentence Segmentation; 6) Sentence Filtering; 7) Identification of Verbs used to Report Findings; 8) Extraction of Words Based on Verbs; and 9) Network Visualization. In the following paragraphs, we further explain each step from Figure 2 while using the data from our application as an example.

First, PDF Text Extraction, as the name hints, transforms the pdf file into plain text. For this, we used the Python package pdfminer.six [10]. The result of this step is a data frame where the rows are the articles, and the columns are the articles' names and their cleaned plain text. Second, Text Classification and Filtering categorizes the extracted information into title, abstract, body text, semi structure, and metadata. For this, we transformed the articles' metadata from Scopus [9] into a data frame where the rows are the articles and the columns are the articles' metadata values per article. Then, we merged this with the cleaned plain text database from the previous step. This resulted in a single database with all the metadata and text by article.

Third, Text Normalization means transforming the text into canonical form. For this, we cleaned the data using regular expressions to remove: non-ASCII characters, URLs, and in-text references, such as "(NAME, YEAR)" and "et al. (YEAR)." We also used regular expressions to remove all the strings that referred to the journal's information and copy-rights. Fourth, IMRAD Context Detection assigns text snippets into standard scientific-articles' categories named IMRAD. IMRAD stands for Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion [24]. For this, we implemented an algorithm to split the articles' cleaned plain text into the IMRAD categories. Each of these sections was saved as new independent columns in the database.

Fifth, Sentence Segmentation involves tokenizing the sentences' elements. Here, we used the python package spaCy [25] to tokenize the sentences and to extract the Parts-Of-Speech of each of the articles' sections. Sixth, Sentence Filtering involves filtering out irrelevant information. In our work, this translated into keeping the columns Findings, Conclusions, and Discussions, from which we will extract all the sentences where the findings are referred to, as explain in step seven.

Steps seven to nine comprise the contribution of this work.

Step seven corresponds to Verbs Findings Identification, for this we built a dictionary of the verbs commonly used in describing findings. We created a sorted database with all the verbs found in the sentences from step six. Afterward, for each verb, we read a random sample of ten sentences to categorize the verb as: positive, negative, neutral, depend, and none. Positive means that the verb denotes a positive relation, e.g., increase, improve, enhance, etc. Negative refers to a verb that denotes a negative association, e.g., reduce, prevent, constrain, etc. Neutral denotes an undirected association, for example, relate, link, associate, etc. Depend refers to those verbs that require more information to indicate a possible association and direction. For example, "have" could denote a positive association if the following words contain the word positive (e.g. have a positive correlation) and a negative association if the following words contain the word negative (e.g. have a negative association). Other verbs in this category are: affect, influence, show, etc. However, we assign the verb's sign as positive or negative once these verbs are identified based on the extra information. Finally, None refers to those verbs that do not denote an association between the words, such as adopt, cope, and implement.

Step eight corresponds to Words Extraction Based on Verbs; it detects the nouns and adjectives connected by the verbs found in step seven (Figure 3a). For this, we used the Parts-Of-Speech returned in step five. Afterward, we kept unique sentences in the database, namely unique sentences where the verbs connect words formed by adjectives and nouns.

Finally, step nine corresponds to Network Visualization. Our implicit assumption is that the findings can be plotted as directed weighted graphs easily interpreted as possible associations depending on the verb. For this, we dropped out the sentences linked by verbs in the None category. Researchers in the social sciences tend to use vocabulary very carefully; therefore, it is advisable to interpret their results as associations instead of causations. For example, Figure 3a can be translated into the graph plotted in Figure 3b. In Figure 3b, the sign corresponds to the relation between the words based on the verb: +: positively associated; +/-: neutrally associated; and -: negatively associated. In the following section, we further elaborate on the network visualization.  


# Results: Network Visualization of NLP-supported Findings

In this section, we further explain the aesthetics of the network visualization and provide three possible ways to synthesize the findings using networks. This section aims to show how networks make the relationships between the extracted concepts more interpretable by applying the visualizations to the results obtained from the Scopus papers about drivers of farmers' adaptation to climate change.


## Aesthetics of the Network Visualization

For all the networks, we used the following aesthetics. First, the words are arranged in concentric circles where the central words denote terms that have the highest node degree. First, we measure the words' degree to place the nodes in concentric circles. For this, we only considered whether the word appears in at least one finding sentence of each article, but we did not add up the frequency it appears in the article (i.e., by article, its maximum value is one). Suppose we assume there are: n articles and p words in the database. Then the nodes' degree (D) would be given by Equation 1. In Equation 1, I {.} denotes the indicator function, which returns 1 when the word W j appears in the findings sentences of article A i and 0 in any other case.
D(W j ) = i I {Ai(Wj )} i=[1,n]; j=[1,p](1)
Second, the edge weight denotes the weighted frequency the words appeared related in the findings. To measure the edge weight, we use the ratio of the number of times the relationship between the words appeared in one article divided by the number of times the same relation appeared in all the articles. The edge weight (EW ) would be given by Equation 2. In equation 2, A i (W k , W l ) is 1 when there is a findings' sentence that associates words W k and W l and 0 in any other case.
EW (W k , W l ) = i A i (W k , W l ) i j1 j2 A i (W j1 , W j2 ) i=[1,n]; j1,j2=[1,p](2)
Third, the edge color shows the most frequent weighted verb sign linking the words. This is measured by the ratio of the number of times the verb sign appeared in the relation between the words in one article divided by the number of times the verb sign appeared between the words in all the articles. The verb sign (V S) would be given by Equation 3. In equation 3, A i (s, W k , W l ) is 1 when there is a findings' sentence that associates words W k and W l by the sign s and 0 in any other case.
V S(s, W k , W l ) = i A i (s, W k , W l ) i j1 j2 A i (s, W j1 , W j2 )
i= [1,n]; j1,j2= [1,p] (3)

Finally, the color assigned to the node denotes the cluster to which it belongs. However, as shown in the next section, "Application of the Network Visualization," the color of the verb sign could be applied to the node, in which case the visualization would not show the edges. The following section shows how these aesthetics help with the interpretability of the NLP-supported literature review.


## Application of the Network Visualization

In this section, we show three possible ways to synthesize the information using networks. First, we show a network summarizing the articles' findings. Second, we show a word cloud derived from the networks. Finally, we show a network of the factors that drive famers' adaptation to climate change.

The first network visualization summarizes the articles' findings. For this, just showing the connections is not enough. The network visualization has to be done so that the reader can synthesize the knowledge immediately. Therefore, we visualize the connections based on the cluster to which the words belong according to the modularity algorithm [15]. Figure 4 shows the first four clusters of a random sample of 10 articles (we do not show the results for the entire database because of space constraints). Here we see that the clusters' central terms (i.e., the nodes with the highest degrees per cluster) are: adaptation, climate, farmer, and information. The first three central terms give us all the necessary information to understand the main topic of the papers: Farmers' Adaptation to Climate Change. The fourth central term refers to one of the, possibly, most important drivers of adaptation: information.

As information appears to be an important driver of farmers' adaptation to climate change, then we can choose to plot the networks of words related to information. As this network uses all the available information in the database, it is necessary to simplify it. Therefore, we split the visualization in two: the words whose target is information (Fig. 5) and the words whose source is information (Fig. 6). Moreover, as the number of edges increases, removing the edges and coloring the nodes based on the edge sign is better. Figure 5 shows the network of words whose target is information. From here, we see that some variables that enable information are, among others: community, context, finance, age, and (in the case of women) external assistance. Figure 6 shows the network of words whose source is information. Figure 6 shows that information enables awareness, adaptive capacity, skill, adaptation measure, and adaptation strategy. However, in the case of adaptation to climate change, Figure 6 shows two interesting results. While information is positively associated with the node "adaptation climate change," information is neutrally associated with the node "climate change adaptation." These two last results show two limitations of our methodology. First, the algorithm does not detect that those nodes refer to the same term. Second, the network visualization is based on categorical definitions of the sign, namely, the sign that appeared most frequently connecting those nodes. Therefore, it does not consider that some variables might have very close percentages of positive, negative, and neutral associated verbs. The final visualization corresponds to the network of factors that drive farmers' adaptation to climate change ( Figure 7). For this visualization, we used the findings from all the articles. Still, we only kept those nodes that target at least one of the following nodes: farmer adaptation, climate change adaptation, and adaptation climate change. The node color is based on the cluster, and the edge color corresponds to the most frequent sign associated with the verbs connecting the words. This visualization makes it easier to read the findings. For example, age, gender (shown as woman), education, knowledge, and information are frequently positively associated with farmers' adaptation to climate change. This aligns well with the in-depth empirical and theoretical literature on Climate Change Adaptation, relating socio-demographics of individuals to their adaptive capacity and information to individual awareness, risk perception, and response efficacy of a Climate Change Adaptation measure [12,17]. Government and social capital frequently have a neutral association with farmers' adaptation in our results, confirming that the trust in government-led adaptation and social influence and norms are indeed universal drivers as theorized and found in individual cases [1,19]. For the negative associations, we could not connect them with current literature on climate change adaptation because the nodes "friend", "climate", and "farmer adaptation climate" do not convey enough information.

These network visualizations also make it easier to identify and see what variables are more often connected in the articles. This is because of their network location: the closer to the center, the bigger the node degree. For example, in Figure 7, factors like age, information, and market are more likely to appear as farmers' adaptation factors in the database. In contrast, transformative social learning, access extension agent, and government appear less often. So, the visualization gives not only the direction and the frequency of the association Fig. 6: Network where information is the source. The node color represents the most frequent sign between information and the nodes.

between the words but also the frequency the word appears in the database relative to others.


# Conclusions

This article sought to propose an interpretable NLP algorithm and descriptive visualizations to summarize articles' findings when performing systematic literature reviews. Our approach aimed to avoid using Black Box algorithms and opaque machine learning methodologies to extract and synthesize information. On the one hand, our method shows that the use of tailored verb dictionaries help to interpret the results shown in the networks. On the other hand, sensible visualizations of the results also facilitate synthesizing the information. Fig. 7: Clustered networks of words that target at least one of the following terms: farmer adaptation, climate change adaptation, and adaptation climate change. Node colors correspond to the words' cluster.

In terms of our application, we found that information appears as the most frequent term positively associated with farmers' adaptation to climate change. As, it might enable farmers' awareness, adaptive capacity, skills, adaptation measures, adaptation decisions, and adaptation strategies. Besides information, other frequently positively associated variables are age, gender, education, and knowledge. However, results derived from this methodology are just intended to help researchers synthesize information from large amounts of articles. Even though results interpretation should be made cautiously and always based on previous knowledge, this methodology can help researchers keep track of the findings from their areas of expertise.


# Limitations and Future Work

Our work has some limitations that we would like to acknowledge. Compared to machine learning, our methodology requires that researchers subjectively classify the verbs found in sentences samples as conveying positive, negative, or neutral associations between words. However, we do not believe this to be a problem as long as researchers openly share the dictionary they used when implementing this algorithm. Furthermore, as the results are descriptive, everything can be tracked down to check why some words show specific associations and to which article the relations belong. Another limitation is that we based our network visualizations on categorical definitions of the signs: the sign that appeared most frequently. This definition has the limitation that it does not consider that some variables might have very close percentages of associated positive, negative, and neutral verbs. Future work can explore the possibility of showing signs' colors in terms of continuous variables.
