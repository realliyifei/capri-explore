## INTRODUCTION

The Hotel industry is a part of Hospitality industry. Hospitality comes from the French word "hospice," meaning to take care of those traveling and provide for the weary. The history of this industry is long as hospitality providers have been around at least as early as 40 B.C. Hospitality has changed dramatically through the years in response to influences such as wars, economic fluctuations and social changes. The earliest record of the hospitality industry lies with the Romans. Roman men traveled for business and were the first to travel for leisure as well. Once the Roman Empire fell, much of the hospitality industry fell to religious orders such as monasteries who welcomed travelers. With the increased use of the stage coach, English travelers stayed in inns, which were actually private homes that provided a room and meal.

Nowadays, the Hotel Industry are growing much more that it is used to be in the past centuries, they were developing not just as a place for travelers to eat, drinks, and sleep but it became more than that, we have aware that the concept of Hotel is "A hotel as an establishment providing for reward accommodation, food and drink, for travelers and temporary residents and are usually also meals and refreshment and sometimes other facilities for other user" (S Medlik, 2000) and in other definition stated that "Primarily and fundamentally a hotel is an establishment which provides board and lodging, not engaged in interstate commerce, competitive with or affecting interstate commerce (or so related thereto that the regulation of the one involves the control of the other), but is a quasidomestic institution retaining from its ancient origin certain traditional, and acquiring, in its modern development, certain statutory rights and obligations to the public where all persons, not disqualified by condition or conduct, prepared to pay for their accommodation, are to be received and furnished with a room or place to sleep or occupy if such accommodations are available, and with such services and attention as are incident to their use of the hotel as a home, and/or with food, at stipulated prices, and with or without contract as to duration of visit, and which conducts, within the confines of its physical locations, this business of supplying personal services of individuals for profit. Incidental to such fundamental and principal business, the hotel may furnish quarters and facilities for the assemblage of people for social, business or entertainment purposes, and may engage in renting portions of its premises for shops and business whose contiguity is deemed appropriate to an hotel" (Kainthola, 2009) but savvy travellers need more than just a place to stay whenever they were travelling across the continent, what they need is a place that give experiences. a place that provide a state of the art technologies, an unnusual design, a new definition of ambience, a high level of services, an extraordinary selection of food with high quality ingredients prepared by a world michelin star holder chef, etc One method of evaluating hotel quality is the creation of a ranking based on specific criteria and on the assignment of a symbol that certifies a quality category. The symbol and the scale used can vary from one country to another but the most commonly used are the star and the diamond, with a scale of 1 to 5. (Robert Minazzi, 2010) 


## Hotel Classification Systems

Early hotels and inns were little more than an available bed and something barely palatable to eat. The emergence of tourism in the latter half of the 19 th century brought with it an improvement of the standards of the early inns. Some pressure was placed on these facilities to offer some minimum standards where the consumer was able to identify a property with specific amenities. The rating system emerged out of efforts by the Automobile and cycling clubs in Europe, who in their tour books displayed hotels, which they recommended to their membership, based on the guaranteed facilities which these hotels/inns offered. This led to the establishment of rating systems such as the Automobile Association (AA) and its American counterpart the (AAA) and the Michellin tyre company's -Michellin Red Guide and other mobile guides.

After World War II National Tourist Boards began to consider some form of hotel registration/classification system. There was some difficulty in doing so. By 1970 only five European countries had national classification systems, by 1980 this number increased to 22 European countries and 60 countries worldwide. The criteria applied by the classification systems were, and still are not uniformed. There were various meanings attached to registration, classification and grading.

Registration: form of licensing which, may or may not demand a minimum standard. Signifies some conformation with health fire safety legislation. Implies a minimum criteria.

Classification: separation of different types and ranges of accommodation into several categories based on a range of criteria. Hotel accommodations can allow for five to seven categories to be applied. -Other forms of accommodation e.g. motels, guesthouses and self catering apartments seldom justify more than two or three classes.

Grading: often combine with classification, this is a quality assessment awarding a symbol to denote an above average service to an accommodation facility. E.g Green globe classification systems for environment


## Popular Classification Systems

Official Hotel and Resort Guide (OHRG) Travel Industry classification system ratings are deemed as being comparable around the world, making it easier for professionals in the travel trade. Ten Quality levels which can be divided as follows Deluxe: Super Deluxe, Deluxe, Moderate Deluxe, First Class Superior First Class, First Class, Limited Service First Class, Moderate First class Tourist Superior tourist class, tourist class, moderate tourist class These rating combine two elements: (1) Quality of quest accommodations a. room size, quality of furnishings; (2) Extent of hotel facilities a. Number and size of public rooms and meeting facilities.

AA rating system (British System) this system focuses on a consumer's perspective on accommodation properties. The objective was to introduce a classification system easily understood by the consumer. This system is part of the description of properties seen in travel books. The American version is the AAA system.


## Minimum Requirements for AA Recognition

One Star Hotels Hotels in this classification are likely to be small and independently owned, with a family atmosphere. Services may be provided by the owner and family on an informal basis. There may be a limited range of facilities and meals may be fairly simple. Lunch, for example, may not be served. Some bedrooms may not have en suite bath/shower rooms. Maintenance, cleanliness and comfort should, however, always be of an acceptable standard.

Two Star Hotels In this classification hotels will typically be small to medium sized and offer more extensive facilities than at the one star level. Some business hotels come into the two star classification and guests can expect comfortable, well equipped, overnight accommodation, usually with an en-suite bath/shower room. Reception and other staff will aim for a more professional presentation than at the one star level, and offer a wider range of straightforward services, including food and drink. Three Star Hotels At this level, hotels are usually of a size to support higher staffing levels, and a significantly greater quality and range of facilities than at the lower star classifications.

Reception and the other public rooms will be more spacious and the restaurant will normally also cater for nonresidents. All bedrooms will have fully en suite bath and shower rooms and offer a good standard of comfort and equipment, such as a hair dryer, direct dial telephone, toiletries in the bathroom. Some room service can be expected, and some provision for business travelers.

Four Star Hotels Expectations at this level include a degree of luxury as well as quality in the furnishings, decor and equipment, in every area of the hotel. Bedrooms will also usually offer more space than at the lower star levels, and well designed, coordinated furnishings and decor. The en-suite bathrooms will have both bath and fixed shower. There will be a high enough ratio of staff to guests to provide services like porterage, 24-hour room service, laundry and dry-cleaning. The restaurant will demonstrate a serious approach to its cuisine.


## Five Star Hotels

Here you should find spacious and luxurious accommodation throughout the hotel, matching the best international standards. Interior design should impress with its quality and attention to detail, comfort and elegance. Furnishings should be immaculate. Services should be formal, well supervised and flawless in attention to guests' needs, without being intrusive. The restaurant will demonstrate a high level of technical skill, producing dishes to the highest international standards. Staff will be knowledgeable, helpful, well versed in all aspects of customer care, combining efficiency with courtesy.

Red Star Awards AA star classifications are usually depicted in black on signs and in the AA's guides and electronic products. However, at each of the five classification levels, the AA recognizes exceptional quality of accommodation and hospitality by awarding Red Stars for excellence. A hotel with Red Stars, therefore, has been judged to be the best in its star classification and recognizes that the hotel offers outstanding levels of comfort, hospitality and customer care.

Country House Hotels Country House Hotels offer a relaxed, informal atmosphere, with an emphasis on personal welcome. They are usually, but not always, in a secluded or rural setting and should offer peace and quiet regardless of location.


## Town House Accommodation

This classification denotes small, personally run hotels which afford a high degree of privacy, concentrate on luxuriously furnished bedrooms and suites, with highquality room service rather than the public rooms or formal dining rooms usually associated with hotels, but they are usually in areas well served by restaurants. All fall within the Four or Five Star classification.

Travel Accommodation (Lodges) This classification denotes budget accommodation, suitable for an overnight stay usually in purpose-built units close to main roads and motorways, often forming part of motorway service areas. They provide consistent levels of accommodation and service, matching today's expectations.

Guesthouse/Private Hotels The term guest-house can lead to some confusion, particularly when many include the word hotel in their name. For AA purposes, small and private hotels are included in this category when they cannot offer all the services required for the AA hotel star rating system. The term does not imply that guesthouses are inferior to hotels, just that they are different. Many, indeed, offer a very high standard of accommodation. It is not unusual to be offered en suite bathrooms, for instance, or to find a direct-dial telephone and a colour television in your room. Some guest-houses offer bed and breakfast only, so guests must go out for the evening meal. These facilities should state clearly if there are any restrictions to your access to the house, and whether they offer any meals. This should be communicated to the customer when booking.

Farmhouse Farmhouse accommodation is particularly noted for being relatively inexpensive and cosy, with good home-cooking where appropriate. Some are working farms, Guest are at times allowed to participate or view farm activities, there are cases where guest accommodation is run as a separate concern from the farm, and visitors are discouraged from venturing on to the working land. Standards will vary considerably, Some of farmhouses are grand ex-manor houses furnished with antiques and offering a stylish way of life, whereas others offer more simply furnished accommodation, and in others guests may have to share the family bathroom and sitting/dining room.


## Pubs and Inns

We all know what we can expect to find in a traditional inn a cosy bar, a convivial atmosphere, decent beer and pub food. Nevertheless, there are a few extra criteria which must be met for the AA classification: breakfast is a must, in a suitable breakfast room, and the inn should also serve at least light meals during licensing hours. A number of small, fully licensed hotels are classified as inns, and the character of the properties will vary according to whether they are traditional country inns or larger establishments in towns.


## AA Rosette Awards

The AA makes annual rosette awards on a rising scale of one to five for the quality of food served in restaurants and hotel restaurants. Only those offering the highest international standards of cuisine and service will merit the AA's top awards of four or five rosettes.


## Outstanding Quality (5 and 4 Rosettes)

Five rosettes is the supreme accolade, made to chefs at the very top of their profession. This award recognizes superlative standards of cuisine at an international level, evident at every visit in every element of the meal. Creativity, skill and attention to detail will produce dishes cooked to perfection, with intense, exciting flavours in harmonious combinations and faultless presentation. Menus may be innovative or classical, and may use luxury ingredients like lobster, truffles, foie gras, etc. often in unexpected combinations and with secret ingredients that add an extra dimension of taste and interest. At this level, cuisine should be innovative, daring, highly accomplished and achieve a noteworthy standard of consistency, accuracy and flair throughout all the elements of the meal. Excitement, vibrancy and superb technical skill will be the keynotes.


## High Quality

Only cooking of the highest national standard receives three or more rosettes. Menus will be imaginative; dishes should be accurately cooked, demonstrate well developed technical skills and a high degree of flair in their composition. Ingredients will be first-class, usually from a range of specialist suppliers, including local produce only if its quality is excellent. Most items -breads, pastries, pasta, petits fours -will be made in the kitchens, but if any are bought in, for example, breads, the quality will be excellent.


## Good Quality (2 and 1 Rosettes)

Two rosettes denote cooking that displays a high degree of competence on the part of the chef. The menus should include some imaginative dishes, making use of very good raw ingredients, as well as some tried and tested favourites. Flavours should be well balanced and complement or contrast with one another, not over-dominate.

One rosette denotes simple, carefully prepared food, based on good quality, fresh ingredients, cooked in such a way as to emphasize honest flavours. Sauces and desserts will be home-made and the cooking will equate to first-class home cooking. (Organization, 2002) The Seven Stars Reputation Hotels

## Emirates Palace, Abu Dhabi UAE

The building was designed by renowned architect, John Elliott RIBA, who was Senior Vice President at Wimberly, Allison, Tong and Goo, an international firm specialising in Luxury Hotels. It opened in November 2005 but certain restaurants and spas did not open until 2006. The hotel was built by and is owned by the Abu Dhabi government, and is currently managed by the Kempinski Group. The costs to build the hotel were 1.9 billion GBP or 11.02 billion AED. The Emirates Palace occupies 850,000m² of floor space. Underground parking allows housing for 2,500 vehicles. There are two swimming pools and spas. The hotel has its own marina and helipad. The Emirates Palace is the second most expensive hotel ever built, only surpassed by Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.

Emirates Palace, located on 1.3 km of private white sandy beach and surrounded by 85 hectares of beautifully landscaped gardens, with 114 domes that are 80 meters high. It is only 30 min drive from Abu Dhabi airport and 1.5 hours drive from Dubai airport.

Many of the suites offered are furnished in gold and marble. The main central area houses an expansive marble floor, balconies and a large patterned dome above, picked out in gold. The topmost floor has six Rulers' Suites which are reserved solely for Emirati royalty and dignitaries. [1] The hotel also contains a large conference centre. In December 2010, it boasted the world's most expensive Christmas tree, valued at over 11 million dollars.

Overall, the hotel has 302 rooms and 92 suites. But, the hotel has 16 Palace Suites on the sixth and seventh floors. 22 three-bedroom suites are reserved for hosting Heads of State or Government, recently for example, Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor Angela Merkel.

## What Makes Seven Stars Hotel Different?

Hotels, like restaurants, movies and TV shows, are classified by a star rating. Hotels are usually rated based on the quality of the food, the location, accessibility, room sizes, amenities, view and the availability and quality of fitness centers and spa. So far, there has not been a uniform hotel ranking guide, which is why different standards are set per country.

Five star hotels are luxury hotels and mostly cater to celebrities, high ranking political figures and business moguls. Most of the time, business executives stay at five star hotels when they are on a business trip and meeting with other investors. On the other hand, a seven star hotel caters to royalty and billionaires (and their heirs) with lots of money to spend. Rich business executives stay in seven star hotels but their stay may not be connected to business. Seven star hotels are generally chosen for leisure stays.

Luxury hotels or five star hotels are constructed from high-grade materials and have intricate architectural designs. Mostly, 24-hour room service is available, aside from gourmet dining and a high staff-to-guest ratio. Rooms are huge and are decorated with fine furnishings. The rooms have luxury bath products and toiletries, high-speed Internet access and DVD players. Most five star hotels have access to a golf course; spa and wellness center; pool and tennis courts. The most luxurious room in a five star hotel is the presidential suite.

Though a Five star hotel seems to have everything a person want to feel luxurious, a seven star hotel tops this. They have such services as a Rolls Royce Limousine guest shuttle service, a royal suite rather than a presidential one and gold furnishing. On average, the cheapest room for two in a seven star hotel is at $1700 per night, this will get you and a companion to a deluxe five star hotel room for three nights, for instance, Burj Al Arab has a 780 square meters royal suite with a rate of $28.000 per person per night, the hotel has a magnificent gold and marble staircases, mahogany furniture, master bedrooms with rotating four poster canopy, Hermes body products and a Rolls Royce, BMW or helicopter transfer or service.

Staffs at seven star hotels research their incoming guests. Because of this, guests are known by everyone working in the hotel, making the stay more memorable. Five star hotel staffs are not required to research the guest mainly because it is not part of what you are paying them for and also the fact that they receive a greater number of guests and reservations. Additionally, the rates at seven star hotels are higher so it is no surprise that staff would pay significantly more attention to their guest


## CONCLUSION

The seven stars rating hotels were simply a reputation given by the media and the customer who have experiencing them. There are no such things as the proper rating or classification given by hotel association concerning on how the seven stars hotel should look like in terms of facilities, state of the art technology, etc. A seven star hotel is considered a synonym for grandeur, class and style. Offering luxuries like limousine service, private transfer for all guests via private golf cart, private butler service and just about anything else that is being associated with vanity. These days, savvy and wealthy globetrotters, demand for caviar, personal butlers and Bentley and more tasty accommodation morsels as they prefer to travel (and rest) in style when it comes to bedding heads for the night. Seven star hotels accomplish all this. However, the seven stars hotels means that the Hotel had pass the five star standard rating given by Hotel association. It gives more than just a service, but experience that customers will not find in any five star deluxe hotels, the guest are pampered with luxury and a very personalized service. And at the end the price tag is worth the service. Finally, it is a matter of how the seven stars Hotels can compete to exceed customer expectation and to gain the reputations as the best hotel in the world.
