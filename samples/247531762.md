a b s t r a c tThe genus Tetrastigma belongs to the Vitaceae family and contains over 100 species. This paper reviewed folk uses, chemical constituents, pharmacological activities, and clinical applications of the medicinal plants in the genus Tetrastigma. In addition, the paper also discussed the current problems for the further studies. Up to now, more than 240 compounds were reported from the genus Tetrastigma, covering 74 flavonoids, 14 terpenoids, 19 steroids, 21 phenylpropanoids, 14 alkaloids and others constituents. Among them, flavonoids are the major and the characteristic chemical constituents in this genus. Modern pharmacological studies and clinical practice showed that the extracts and chemical constituents of Tetrastigma species possessed wide pharmacological activities including antitumor, antioxidative, hepatoprotective, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activities. The information summarized in this paper provides valuable clues for new drug discovery and an incentive to expand the research of genus Tetrastigma.

## Introduction

Tetrastigma (Vitaceae) contains over 100 species widely spreading in Asia and Oceania. Among them, 45 species are distributed in China, mainly in Guangdong, Yunnan and Zhejiang Provinces and Guangxi autonomous region, in China . Some Tetrastigma species have a long history as ethnomedicines for the treatment of many diseases, such as menstrual disorders, rheumatic pain, bruises, gastralgia and other diseases in southwest China. These medicinal plants with remarkable curative effects were deeply loved by local people, especially Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg, which was awarded as one of the new ''eight famous TCMs" in Zhejiang Province (Ji et al., 2021). The medicinal plants in this genus attracted increasing attention due to their structural diversity and remarkable pharmacological activities. Besides, many studies showed that the crude extracts and the monomeric compounds from Tetrastigma species exhibited diverse biological activities, such as antitumor, antioxidative, hepatoprotective, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activities (Fig. 1). The chemical and pharmacological research on this genus is limited, except the species T. hemsleyanum. In order to provide theoretical reference for further research and to comprehensively understand the medicinal applications on this genus, this paper systematically reviewed folk uses, chemical constituents, pharmacological activities and clinical applications of Tetrastigma species based on available databases including SciFinder, Pubmed, Google Scholar, CNKI and others over the past 20 years.


## Folk uses

In China, many Tetrastigma species are traditionally and ethnically used as folk medicine to treat various diseases for a long time. Some species have a long medicinal history, such as T. hemsleyanum, known as ''Sanyeqing" or ''Jingxiandiaohulu" (Cheng & Fu, 2016), T. hypoglaucum Planch, known as ''Wuzhuajinlong" (Liu, 2000), and T. obtectum (Wall.) Planch, known as ''Yanwujia" (Shi, 2012) in Chinese. T. hemsleyanum was firstly recorded in Ben Cao Gang Mu (Compendium of Materia Medica) (Ming Dynasty, CE 1590) and also recorded in multiple ancient books of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), including Zhi Wu Ming Shi Tu Kao (Chihwu ming-shih t'u kao) (Qing Dynasty, Wu, 2014), Jiangxi Herbal Medicine and Common Folk Herbal Medicine in Zhejiang (Ji et al., 2021). These ancient works described that its root tuber or whole plant could be used as medicine and it was slightly bitter in flavor and neutral in nature. It had the effect of strengthening liver, and its functions were mainly for clearing heat and detoxification, dispelling wind and phlegm, promoting blood circulation and relieving pain. T. hypoglaucum was recorded in The Dictionary of Chinese Herbal Medicine. Its root or whole plant could be used as medicine and it was bitter, neutral in nature. Tetrastigma planicaule (Hook.) Gagnep was recorded in Handbook of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Guangzhou Army. It was one of 108 classic medicines in Yao ethnomedicine (Shao, 2011). The whole plant was used as medicine and it was pungent, astringent in flavor and warm in nature. Its main function was to dispel wind and dehumidify, relax ten- L. Zhang, B. Li, M. Wang et al. Chinese Herbal Medicines 14 (2022) 210-233 dons and activate collaterals. T. obtectum was recorded in Si Chuan Zhong Yao Zhi (a dictionary of Chinese medicine). Its root or whole plant could be used as medicine and it was warm in nature, pungent in taste, and non-toxic. The functions were mainly for dispelling wind, dehumidification and detoxification. Out of the 100 species of Tetrastigma identified, only five species were reported in folk medicines as medicinal plants. Moreover, T. hemsleyanum was the one that was most widely used and studied. The folk names, geographical distribution, medicinal parts and folk uses of the genus Tetrastigma are listed in Table 1.


## Chemical constituents

So far, a total of 248 compounds were isolated from five Tetrastigma species (T. hemsleyanum, T. hypoglaucum, T.obtectum, T. planicaule, and T. erubescens), including flavonoids and their glycosides (1-74), saccharides (75-91), terpenoids (92-105), steroids (106-124), phenylpropanoids (125-145), alkaloids (146-159) and other compounds. Flavonoids and their glycosides are the major constituents in the genus Tetrastigma and also exhibit significant antitumor activity, which are the research hotspots now. The information about chemical names, sources, and references of all compounds is summarized in Table 2.


### Flavonoids

Flavonoids are major and characteristic chemical components of the genus Tetrastigma. Thus far, more than 70 flavonoids were isolated in this genus and most of them are flavonoid carbon glycoside compounds. According to the conformation, they could be divided into four types: flavones (1-38), flavonols (39-62), flavanones (69), and flavan-3-ols (65-66 and 70-74). The aglycones of these flavonoids are mainly kaempferol (45), apigenin (1), orientin (26), vitexin (28), isorhamnetin (42) and quercetin (55). Most sugar moieties of flavonoid glycosides are glucose, rhamnose and xylose, which are typically connected to C-3, C-6, C-7 or C-8. What's more, there are oxygen-containing substituents at the C-7, such as OH, OMe or glycosyl in most of the flavonoid carbon gly-cosides. The names and sources of these compounds are shown in Table 2, and the structures are shown in Fig. 2.


#### Flavones

Up to now, 38 flavones and their glycosides (1-38) were reported from the genus Tetrastigma. The features of these compounds are that there are usually hydroxyl groups at the C-5 and C-7, and their aglycones mainly are apigenin (1), orientin (26), vitexin (28), and isorhamnetin (42). Furthermore, this series of compounds are mainly flavone carbon glycosides with glycosyl moieties connected at C-6 or C-8. Apigenin-6-C-a-Lrhmnnopyranosyl-(1-4)-a-L-arabinopymnoside (2) and apigenin-8-C-a-L-rhmnnopyranosyl-(1-4)-a-L-arabinopymnoside (3) were new natural products from T. hemsleyanum. Five new flavones (6-8 and 37-38) were isolated from stems and leaves of T. obtectum.


#### Flavonols

The phytochemical studies led to isolation and identification of 24 flavonols and their glycosides (39-62) from this genus. These series of compounds were mainly found in T. hemsleyanum, and they are mono-O-glycosides and di-O-glycosides, and the glycosyls are connected to C-3 or C-7. And their aglycones mainly were kaempferol (45) and quercetin (55). There are oxygen-containing substituents at the C-3' and C-4' of these flavonoid oxygen glycosides, such as OH and OMe.


#### Flavanones, dihydrochalcone and flavan-3-ols

Apart from flavonoids and flavonols, there are ten compounds of other types, including one dihydrochalcone (68), two flavanone (63 and 69), and eight flavan-3-ols (65-67 and 70-74). Compounds 71-74 isolated from T. hemsleyanum are flavan-3-ol derivatives tannins.


### Polysaccharides and monosaccharides

Polysaccharides and monosaccharides are also important constituents in Tetrastigma species. Previous studies indicated that polysaccharides had hypoglycemic and immunoregulatory activity.  (Qian et al., 2015).

### Terpenoids

So far, there are 14 terpenoids isolated from Tetrastigma species, including seven triterpenoids (92-98) and seven others (99-105). Triterpenoids isolated from Tetrastigma species can be divided into three types for their different skeletons: oleanane-type (92-96), lanostane-type (98) and ursane-type (97). Among them, 92-94, 97 and 98 were isolated from aerial parts of T. hemsleyanum. Compounds 92, 95 and 96 were obtained from the stem of T. planicaule.

Other terpenoids were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. One sesquiterpene (101) and four monoterpenes (102-105) were isolated from T. hemsleyanum. In particular, there were two norisoprenoids (99-100) that were found in the stem of T. erubescens. The names and sources of these compounds are shown in Table 2, and the structures are shown in Fig. 4.


### Steroids

Steroids are another type of bioactive constituent in Tetrastigma species. Steroids are secondary metabolites formed by cyclopentano-perhydrophenthrene with four ring systems (6/6/6/5) in their basic skeleton. To date, 19 steroids were identified in the genus Tetrastigma and they were sterols and mainly found in T. planicaule and T. hemsleyanum. The names and sources of these compounds are shown in Table 2, and the structures are shown in Fig. 5.


### Phenylpropanoids

At present, phytochemical studies led to the isolation and identification of 21 phenylpropanoids from the Tetrastigma species. According to the structure characteristics, they can be divided into two types: coumarins (125-144), and lignans (145). Two coumarins (125-126) and one lignan (145) were obtained from the stem of T. erubescens. Two coumarins (126-127) were isolated from the stems of T. planicaule. In fact, almost all phenylpropanoids were found in T. hemsleyanum, and 130-139 were isomers and derivatives of chlorogenic acid (137). The names and sources of these compounds are shown in Table 2, and the structures are shown in Fig. 6.


### Alkaloids

Alkaloids are also important active ingredients in this genus and they are mainly indole alkaloids. At present, 14 alkaloids were reported from this genus, including nine indole alkaloids (146-154) and five other alkaloids (155-159). Indole alkaloids: tetrastigmindole A (153) and tetrastigmindole B (154) (Shi, 2012) were new secondary metabolites isolated from T. obtectum. Seven indole alkaloids (146-151 and 153), an amide (156), a maleimide (155) and a carboline (157) were isolated from the aerial parts of T. hemsleyanum, and they were alkaloids isolated from the genus Tetrastigma firstly. Furthermore, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies showed that the lactam moiety may be an important structural element for their anti-inflammatory activity. Only one alkaloid, coelarthenol (158) (Chen, 2017), was isolated from T. planicaule. The names and sources of these compounds are shown in Table 2, and the structures are shown in Fig. 7.


### Other compounds

Aliphatics, phenolic acids and other compounds also presented abundantly in this genus, 160-194 are long chain fatty acids and 196-223 are phenolic acids. 196-199 were derivatives of resveratrol (196), 224-226 were anthraquinones, while 227-235 were other compounds. The names and sources of these compounds are shown in Table 2, and the structures of representative compounds are shown in Fig. 8.


## Pharmacological activities

The extracts and compounds of Tetrastigma species showed various biological activities including antitumor, antipyretic and analgesic, antiviral, hepatoprotective and antidiabetic properties. These bioactivities are summarized below.   hemsleyanum not only promoted the proliferation of NK (Natural Killer cell), but also enhanced the cytotoxic activity of NK cells against gastric cancer cell lines BGC-823. The possible mechanism may be that the water extract of T. hemsleyanum could increase expressions of perforin (PFP), Granzyme (GraB) and CD107a (Yuan et al., 2016). The water extract and diethyl ether extract of T. hemsleyanum displayed definite antitumor activity in vitro, and their IC 50 were 99.7 lg/mL and 127.8 lg/mL, respectively. (Chen, 2014   . The flavonoid extract of T. hemsleyanum had a significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism may be related to the regulation of ubiquitinproteasome pathway (Zhong et al., 2017). The ethyl acetate extract of T. hemsleyanum showed antitumor activity by inhibiting the subcutaneous transplanted tumor of HepG-2 without dose-dependent. The mechanism may be related to the increase of the levels of serum TNF-a and IFN-c . The ethyl acetate extracts of T. hemsleyanum could induce apoptosis of human liver cancer HCCC-9810 cells with a dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibitory (Wang & Peng, 2015) and its IC 50 of treatment for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were 275.3 mg/L, 183.3 mg/L and 75.8 mg/L, respectively. The possible mechanism was based on activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Through MTT method, it was found the petroleum ether and n-butanol extracts of T. planicaule showed significant antitumor activity by inhibiting the growth of liver cancer HepG-2 cells (Chen, 2017). The flavonoid extract of T. hemsleyanum showed antitumor effect, and the possible mechanism was related to the down-regulation of MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells), COX-2 and PGE2 (Hu et al., 2021). The flavonoid extract of T. hemsleyanum showed antitumor activity in inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis of bladder cancer cells through STAT3 signaling pathway (Wu, 2021). The flavonoid extract of T. hemsleyanum showed antitumor activity in reducing the proportion of Treg cells in Lewis lung cancer mice, improving the cellular immune function, and inducing the apoptosis of transplanted tumor tissues (Lin et al., 2021).

The polysaccharides from roots of T. hemsleyanum were explored for their antitumor activity by MTT methods. The result showed the polysaccharides could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and induce apoptosis. The mechanism may be related to the down- 


#### Antitumor activity of monomeric compounds

Apigenin (1) from T. hemsleyanum exhibited significant antitumor activity and its IC 50 values for HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma), HCT-8 (human colon) and A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial) cells were (73.16 ± 0.96), (45.04 ± 1.2 5) and (48.66 ± 1.56) lg/mL, respectively . b-Sitosterol (106) and oleanolic acid (94) from T. hemsleyanum showed strong cytotoxic activity against Hela 229 (human cervical cancer cells) with IC 50 of 40.78 and 25.69 lg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, oleanolic acid had strong cytotoxic activity to A375 with an IC 50 of 69.87 lg/mL (Ding et al., 2015). Resveratrol (196) and kaempferol (45) displayed significant antitumor activities, and their IC 50 were 92.4 and 294.2 lg/mL (Chen, 2014), respectively.  (Shi, 2012;Zhao et al., 2020). Astragalin (39), isoquercitrin (41), kaempferol-3rutinoside (50), rutin (62) and catechin (65) from T. hemsleyanum exhibited potential antitumor activity against HepG2 with IC 50 of (592.12 ± 3.31) lg/mL, (403.26 ± 1.26) lg/mL, (389.71 ± 4.23) lg/mL, (312.23 ± 1.17) lg/mL and (218.31 ± 2.38) lg/mL, respectively (Sun et al., 2015). p-Hydroxybenzoic acid (206) from T. hemsleyanum exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on MDA-MB-435S cell lines with IC 50 value of (92.39 ± 1.68) lg/mL . Procyanidins B1 (73) and catechin (65) were antitumor angiogenesis active ingredient of T. hemsleyanum, which could reduce the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to inhibit cell migration, invasion and tubular formation ability, and repress the expression of MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT pathway to inhibit tumor angiogenesis (Sun, 2018b).  reducing catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, increasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and enhancing malondialdehyde (MDA) level (Huang et al., 2021). Fe 3+ reduction/antioxidant ability of the different extracts (total extract, petroleum layer, ethyl acetate layer, n-butanol layer, water layer) from T. planicaule was weaker than vitamin C (VC), but higher than tea polyphenols except water layer, and OHÁ scavenging activity of ethyl acetate layer (IC 50 = 0.028 g/L) was higher than V C (IC 50 = 0.044 g/L) and tea polyphenols (IC 50 = 0.032 g/L) (Pan et al., 2013). T. planicaule exhibited a good antioxidant capacity, which may be attributed to the total flavonoid content (Pan et al., 2012). The extracts of the root tuber and aerial part from T. hemsleyanum had certain scavenging ability to 2,2-diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals. When the DPPH scavenging rate of root tuber and aerial part reaches 50%, the required effective concentrations are 0.1902 and 0.1395 mg/L, respectively (Zhang et al., 2021). The soluble polysaccharide extracted by water from T. hemsleyanum showed antioxidant activity. The total antioxidant activity unit was 88.96 UÁmL/L. The scavenging rates of DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radical were 36.8%, 65.1% and 36.8%, respectively (Yin et al., 2020).


### Antioxidant activity


### Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity

Hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-1-oxo-b-carboline (151), hippophamide (152) and S-(-)-trolline (155) from the aerial parts of T. hemsleyanum showed potent inhibitory activity against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NO production in RAW264.7 cells with IC 50  (155) showed anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the activation of NF-jB (nuclear factor jB) and ERK-MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase)-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS in a dose-dependent manner . Furthermore, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies showed the lactam moiety may be an important structural element for their antiinflammatory activity. Polysaccharide extracted from T. hemsleyanum can significantly inhibit the death of RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS, and the contents of TNF-a and IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells were significantly decreased compared with the model group in a dose-dependent manner (Huang, 2017). The extract of T. planicaule had an inhibitory effect on the degradation of IjB-a induced by TNF-a, and it was found that the extract could also inhibit the transport of NF-jB to the nucleus (Zhao et al., 1999). In the experiment of xylene ear swelling model and the acetic acid writhing in mice, T. hypoglaucum extract showed a significant inhibitory effect on ear swelling and writhing in mice . The water extract of T. hemsleyanum showed a good anti-inflammatory effect in COPD copied by being smoked and LPS in rat model. Compared with the model group, the contents of TNF-a and IL-1b and the total number of leukocytes and neutrophils in experimental groups were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner . The flavonoid extract of T. hemsleyanum significantly reduced the number of leukocyte and neutrophils infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (p < 0.01), inhibited secretion of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12p40, TNF-a and sTNF-R1 (p < 0.01), improved the pathological damage of lung tissue, and significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, NF-jB and the DNA binding L. Zhang, B. Li, M. Wang et al. Chinese Herbal Medicines 14 (2022) 210-233 activity of NF-jB in lung tissue (p < 0.01) (Liu et al., 2015). Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (50), isoquercitrin (41), rutin (62) in roots and vitexin (28) and orientin (26) in leaves from T. hemsleyanum showed anti-inflammatory activity by interacting with Keap1 protein and activating Nrf2 . TTP-1 (86) from T. hemsleyanum could suppress inflammation by attenuating inflammation via COX-2, iNOS, MAPKs pathways. Meanwhile, TTP could ameliorate oxidative damage through Nrf2-Keap1, Sirt1-FoxO1 pathways in RAW264.7 cells in vitro (Chu et al., 2020). Kaempferol rutinoside (50), isoquercitrin (41), rutin (62), vitexin (28) and orientin (26) from T. hemsleyanum could reduce the protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1b. Furthermore, vitexin (28) had the strongest antiinflammatory which mechanism was related to directly binds with Keap1 to block Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to activate Nrf2, and thereby inhibiting gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Xing, 2020).


### Hepatoprotective activity

Li et al. (2018) used ANIT (a-isothiocyanatoacetate) to replicate the acute jaundice hepatitis model that caused liver damage in mice and found that the alcohol extract of T. hemsleyanum had a protective effect on liver damage. The mechanism of action was likely through reducing the production of inflammatory factors, promoting the metabolism of total bilirubin, and reducing the degree of lipid peroxidation. The alcohol extract of T. planicaule had a remarkable protective effect against liver injury by resisting the increase of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) (p < 0.01) and alanine transaminase (ALT) (p < 0.01) in mice with acute liver injury caused by CCl 4 , down-regulating the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.01) in liver homogenate, enhancing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p < 0.01), and significantly improving the pathological changes of liver tissue (Bin et al., 2016).


### Antidiabetic activity

A novel polysaccharide THDP-3 (87) purified from cane leaves of T. hemsleyanum exhibited significant hypoglycemic activity in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. THDP-3 can promote glycogen synthesis and inhibit gluconeogenesis to reduce blood glucose, which was related to the key hepatic glycogen metabolism related enzymes including glucokinase (GK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) (Ru et al., 2019). THP, a watersoluble polysaccharide from T. hemsleyanum showed significantly hypoglycemic activities on alloxan-induced mice. The result of histopathological staining compared with glibenclamide in alloxan-induced mice indicate that it could restore the structure of pancreas, and had low side effects on the liver or kidney. Thus, this study provided a mechanistic basis that THP (89) could be used as a potential natural candidate for diabetes with little side effect (Ru et al., 2018). Tetrastigmindole A (153), cis-apigenin-6-v inyl-7 00 -rhamnoside (37) and apigenin-8-C-[6-deoxy-2-O-(a-Lrhamnopyranosyl)-xylo-hexopyranos-3-uloside (6) from T. obtectum showed potential anti-diabetic effects by enhancing the GLUT4 translocation and promoting absorption of glucose (Shi, 2012).


### Antiviral bioactivity

The antiviral bioactivity of rutin (62), kaempferol (45), astragalin (39), quercitrin (56), quercetin (55), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (50), procyanidin dimmer (71) and epicatechin (65) from the dried rhizome parts of T. hemsleyanum was explored by correlation analysis statistical method. The result indicated that those compounds were positively related to antiviral activity . The n-butanol and ethyl acetate extracts of T. hemsleyanum exhibited antiviral bioactivity against RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) with therapeutic index (T1) values of 128 and 64, respectively. They were obviously superior to ribavirin (T1 = 6.25) . The extracts of T. hemsleyanum (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and n-butanol extracts) had inhibitory effects on hepatitis B virus (HBV) by decreasing the secretion of HbsAg and HbeAg (Yang & Wu, 2009). T. hemsleyanum leaves extract (THLE) exhibited protective effects against acrylamide-induced toxicity in HepG2 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans by in vivo and in vitro models and 5-caffeoylquinic acid was the key active component. DAF-16/FOXO gene was involved in the protective effect via regulating the expression levels of downstream antioxidant genes (Chu et al., 2020). The alcohol extract from root tuber of T. hemsleyanum could improve the survival rate of mice infected with influenza A H1N1 virus by reducing the damage of exgenous viruses to cell, enhancing spleen T cell proliferation and NK cell killing activity, improving the cellular immune function of mice. Its mechanism of action may be related to the up-regulation of the concentration of pro-inflammatory factor IFN-c and IL-2 in serum and lung tissue, downregulating the concentration of inflammatory factor INF-a in serum or inhibiting the up-regulation of the concentration of inflammatory factor TNF-a in lung tissue (Liu, 2019).


### Other activities

The flavonoids of T. hemsleyanum indicated remarkable inhibitory on viability and proliferation of leukemia NB-4 cells using CCk8 assay and BrdU test, the IC 50 at 48 h was 2.26 g/L. Furthermore, it could induce apoptosis of leukemia NB-4 cells through the p38 MAPK signal pathway and the pathway of apoptotic proteins (Wu et al., 2019). T. hypoglaucum had a protective effect on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. It could reduce myocardial cells injury, and alleviate oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction . The extract of T. hemsleyanum could promote the proliferation and function changes of NK cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and up-regulate the NK cell surface expression of PFP, GrB, CD107a and IFN-c . T. hypoglaucum extract displayed a strong bacteriostasis effect testing with the bacteriostasis of TCM. Its MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) against 55 strains of MRSE (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis) and 43 strains of MSSE (methicillinresistant and sensitive S. epidermidis) were 1185 lg/mL and 286 lg/mL (p < 0.05), respectively . The monomeric compounds are summarized in Table 3, and the extracts are summarized in Table 4.

### Treatment of other diseases

Li (2001) developed an innovative Chinese medicine (using Sanyeqing and other materials) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B pneumonia. Many studies showed this medicine had the functions of inhibiting hepatitis B virus, regulating body's immunity. Xu (2006) established a prescription named Sanyeqing Shigao Tang (taking Sanyeqing as the main ingredient with raw gypsum) to treat 72 cases of exogenous fever in children.The result indicated 22 patients were recovered with the total efficiency of 94.4%. Ji (2020) found that Sanyeqing had a good effect on the treatment of redness, swelling, inflammation, ulceration and other symptoms after mosquito bited. Zhou (2013) used Hugan Toudu decoction containing 20 g of Sanyeqing to treat 228 cases of chronic hepatitis B. The result showed that the total efficiency of the Hugan Toudu decoction group was higher than the Chinese patent medicine group and modern medicines group (p ＜0.01). In some areas of China, Sanyeqing was also used for the treatment of common gynecological diseases such as hemorrhage, leucorrhea, measles complicated with pneumonia, anal fissure, chronic bronchitis, etc, and had good therapeutic effect on high fever and low fever cough in clinical . Ge (2012) established an oral liquid with dozens of herbal medicines such as Biandanteng (T. planicaule), combined with the Zhuang ethnomedicine Taijiacupuncture and moxibustion to treat 113 cases of patient with chronic lumbar muscle strain. The result indicated 76 cases were cured and the total efficiency was 92.03%. Lu (2001) formulated a prescription named Qigui Qianjinba Tang with over ten herbal medicines including Biandanteng to treat 80 cases of patient with arthralgia syndrome. The treatment results showed 14 patients (17.5%) were cured and the total efficiency was 90%. Zhang et al. (2016) developed an external uses of Chinese medicine prescription (taking herbal medicine T. planicaule as the main ingredient) for treatment of rheumatism. This prescription displayed a high clinical improvement effect on rheumatism related diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Chen (Chen, 2000) used the juice from the rattan of T. planicaule to treat 37 cases of bovine with traumatic keratitis. The result indicated that 33 cases were cured, and the total efficiency 89.2%. This result also showed T. planicaule could improve micro blood circulation, dissipate inflammation and blood stasis, remove nebula for improving eyesight.

## Conclusion and outlook

The Tetrastigma species had many interesting chemical constituents and obvious pharmacological activities. Therefore, Tetrastigma species could be considered a potential candidate of nutritional supplement and new drug discovery. This review summarized 248 secondary metabolites of species in genus Tetrastigma including flavonoids, saccharides, terpenoids, steroids, phenylpropanoids and alkaloids, described the recent advance in pharmacological activities of the extracts and the metabolites from Tetrastigma species, and summarized the folk uses and up-to date clinical treatments of Tetrastigma species. Plants of Tetrastigma species were most commonly used in the treatment of tumor-related diseases and had definite curative effect, and the extracts and compounds of Tetrastigma species exhibited obvious antitumor activity. It provided preliminary evidence of the relationship between modern pharmacological studies and folk uses of anti-tumor. The underlying mechanism may be related to inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing cell apoptosis, inhibiting tumor cell migration and invasion, inhibiting tumor cell angiogenesis, reversing tumor cell multidrug resistance, regulating the body's own immunity and so on. Furthermore, the folk uses of these species are the treatment of pneumonia, nephritis, hepatitis, rheumatism, arthralgia, traumatic, injury, inflammation, fever, snakebites, etc. Pharmacological properties such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anal-gesic activities have supported the traditional uses of Tetrastigma species. It was noteworthy that the anti-diabetic effect was a new biological activity discovered in recent years.

However, there are still yet some problems in the further development of Tetrastigma species. Firstly, to date most studies focused mainly on the T. hemsleyanum, while the phytochemical and biological activities and clinical researches of the other species were not comprehensively investigated. In order to expand and develop new medicinal sources, more studies should be done on other species. What's more, the resources of T. hemsleyanum are limited, which greatly restrict their utilization and development. Therefore, a well-developed cultivation technique will be needed to establish. Secondly, existing pharmacological and biological activity researches were insufficient to clarify the relationship between traditional functions and clinical applications and the mechanism of action. As such, it is necessary to deepen the research on the pharmacological mechanism and analyses of the structure-activity relationships of secondary metabolites of Tetrastigma species in the future. Finally, the quality control of Tetrastigma species is poorly investigated. Thus, the well-developed analytical methods are needed to ensure their consistency, safety and efficacy. This article could be a useful tool in assisting researchers to discoveri new drug candidates for further research and provides an incentive to expand the research of genus Tetrastigma.
