High-dose olanzapine in treatment resistant schizophrenia. A case report and literature review Facilitated early discharge in Wandsworth
*Corresponding author. *Corresponding author.
Objective. We report a case of a 58-year-old gentleman who was hospitalised intermittently for one year due to treatment resistant schizophrenia. Prior to hospitalisation he had been prescribed standard antipsychotics for decades without full resolution of positive psychotic symptoms. During his final admission lasting six months he was guarded, suspicious, irritable, constantly paced the corridor and displayed thought block and paranoid persecutory delusions. He would not enter the assessment room or allow any blood or ECG monitoring, however, he was compliant with oral medication. He was successfully treated with high dose olanzapine (40mg/day) and was discharged to the community. The aim of this study is to bring awareness and add to the body of evidence for the use of high-dose olanzapine in patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia in whom a trial of clozapine is not possible. Case report. The patient gave written consent for this case report to be written and presented. An extensive literature review was performed and key papers were identified. Discussion focuses on the key areas in the literature. Discussion. This case demonstrates that high-dose olanzapine can be used effectively as an alternative to clozapine in treatment resistant schizophrenia. Conclusion. This case highlights the need for further evaluation of high-dose olanzapine as an alternative to clozapine in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

There is limited research surrounding facilitated early discharge (FD) and Home Treatment Teams (HTTs). This study aimed to compare patients who received FD with patients who were discharged without FD to identify whether there were significant differences in terms of social demographics, illness characteristics, health outcome and treatment duration. Using this data we furthermore aimed to provide proposals to help advance the effectiveness of FD, as well as suggesting concepts of where future research should lie. Case report. A randomised sample of patients who received FD and patients who were discharged without FD was obtained from a South London Hospital. This was manually narrowed down to patients specifically treated by the Wandsworth Home Treatment Team (WHTT). Socio-demographic and clinical data were then attained from the patients' electronic records to compare and statistically analyse between the two groups. Discussion. Patients who received FD from the WHTT were found to have significantly less previous psychiatric admissions compared to those who were discharged without FD (p = 0.032). All other variables were found to have no association with FD. Conclusion. Having a high number of previous psychiatric admissions seems to be an aspect that decreases the chance of being allocated FD. This variable can be seen as an indicator of severity of illness and a challenging social environment; it could therefore be valuable to take this variable into consideration when allocating FD. Furthermore, total treatment duration was found to not be significantly different for FD and non-FD patients, thus supporting the use of CRHTTs as an equivalent alternative for inpatient admission, however, national scale research should be conducted to strengthen and expand on these findings.

Obsessive compulsive disorder: a case of extreme obsessional slowness in an 18-year-old presenting to the national OCD unit Objective. Obsessional slowness in OCD is a rare phenomenon on which there is minimal published literature. This is a particularly severe and atypical case of early onset OCD with extreme obsessional slowness and mutism. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of similar severity published in this age group. This report seeks to provide discussion of important organic causes that may need to be considered as well as information on treatment approach. Case report. An 18-year-old male was admitted to the National OCD Unit, Springfield Hospital with a history of autism and normal development until the age of 14, after which symptoms of OCD with fear of contamination emerged, followed by progressive motor slowness and mutism.

Due to the severity of OCD and self-neglect he had two previous admissions to CAMHS wards and required a course of ECT to treat catatonic symptoms age 17.

Pharmacological treatment has included Aripiprazole 5 mg and Fluoxetine 60 mg, which the patient was taking at admission. The latter was subsequently switched to Sertraline 250 mg and Aripiprazole increased. As it was hypothesized that his obsessional slowness stemmed from severe levels of anxiety, Buspirone was also added.

Therapy has been intensive, although communication difficulties have made targeting specific fears challenging as the exact nature of the intrusive thoughts remains unclear. Discussion. Following combined neurology and neuropsychiatry review, the patient spent four weeks in a general hospital for further investigation as it was initially felt an organic cause was likely. Initial differentials included Juvenile Onset Parkinson's or Wilson's disease. Both were subsequently ruled out and despite multiple investigations, no obvious organic cause was found. A markedly abnormal FDG PET scan showed findings usually seen in advanced dementia, but not necessarily clinically correlating to his current presentation.

The OCD unit have continued to provide intensive input and tailored treatment programme, encouraging actions against any rules he has in place. Prompting and pacing, verbal exercises and regular stretching exercises due to stooped posture which he attributed to needing to obey certain rules have been used. Conclusion. It is important for clinicians to be aware of obsessional slowness in OCD and this report highlights a particularly rare and severe example in a young adult who has been difficult to treat. Organic causes may need to be considered and MDT approach to treatment is essential.
