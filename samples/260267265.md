## Introduction

Simmons-Smith reagent [Et 2 Zn, CH 2 I 2 or Zn, CH 2 I 2 =ICH 2 ZnI] is one of the metal carbenoids that has been widely used in the cyclopropanation of olefins and allylic alcohols [1][2][3][4][5]. Simmons-Smith reagent was discovered by Simmons and Smith in 1958, when they performed stereospecific synthesis of cyclopropanes in high yield by reacting alkenes with diiodomethane in the presence of zinc [6]. This zinc carbenoid reagent is a powerful synthetic tool for the stereoselective addition of a methylene unit to chiral olefins [7]. The utility of this reaction in organic chemistry is due to the high stereospecific nature and efficient chiral version (>90% ee) that avoids the use of covalently bonded chiral auxiliaries [3,[7][8][9]. More particularly, Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is a well-suited protocol for the conversion of cationically polymerizable olefins (such as vinyl ethers) into the corresponding cyclopropanes [4,8]. The enantiopure synthesis of various allylic alcohols has been reported in the literature by employing asymmetric Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation [3]. The mechanistic studies of Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation postulated that iodomethylzinc iodide and alkene reacts to form a butterfly-shaped transition state and proceeds in a concerted fashion to produce cyclopropanes ( Figure 1) [2,[6][7][8]. The rate of the Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation reaction depends upon various factors such as solvent [7], substituents present on the substrate [8][9][10][11] and the nature of substituent present on the zinc carbenoid [8,[12][13][14]. The choice of solvent in this reaction has an important role because of the electrophilic nature of zinc carbenoid and the Lewis acidity of the reagent. The rate of Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation decreases as the basicity of the solvent increases. The generally used solvents for this reaction include dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane [7] and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) [15], as these are non-basic and unreactive toward zinc reagent. Furthermore, these are polar enough to stabilize the substrates [7]. The presence of various heteroatoms in substrates (acting as a directing group) increases the rate of reaction by creating an orderly transition state to achieve an effective stereocontrol. The electron-rich olefins react faster with carbenoids than those of electron-poor olefins. A variety of chiral auxiliaries/functionalities, namely, ketals, allylic ethers, enol ethers, chiral enamides and vinyl boronic esters, are well compatible toward the asymmetric Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation [2,[8][9][10][11]16].

Initially, only CH2I2 and Zn-Cu were used for cyclopropanation but were not much reactive, although they were a stable reagent. With the passage of time, various modifications have been made in this reagent [6,7]. Wittig modified the original Simmons-Smith reagent by reacting ZnX2 with CH2N2 to form Zn(CH2X)2. In 1966, the Furukawa modification was performed by reacting Et2Zn and CH2I2 while performing cyclopropanation on a series of polymerizable olefins. The syntheses of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and many other cyclopropanated products have been reported by using this methodology [8]. Denmark disclosed that the chloro-substituted reagent (generated from Et2Zn and ClCH2I) is more reactive than the Iodo-substituted one (Et2Zn and CH2I2) [16]. According to Charette, bipy. Zn(CH2I)2 complex is very efficient, as it can be isolated easily and stored in a freezer for a long time [3]. In the continuation of this work, several (halomethyl)zinc compounds and their complexes have been studied by Denmark and Charette [3,16]. The use of acidic additives such as substituted phenols and CF3CO2H, in addition to Et2Zn and CH2I2, is also considered efficient, especially for the cyclopropanation of less reactive alkenes ( Figure 2).

The cyclopropyl unit exists as a core structural unit in a large family of natural and biologically active compounds such as alkaloids, terpenoids, amino acids, nucleosides, polyketides, fatty acids and drugs. These cyclopropane rings containing natural compounds exhibit a remarkable pharmaceutical profile and a broad range of biological activities including antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, anticancer, antibiotic and antibacterial activities [10,11,17,18]. Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is well suited for the diastereoselective and enantioselective synthesis of these natural products with the exact incorporation of desired stereogenic centers. (+)-Trans-chrysanthemic acid 1, (+)-curacin A 2, 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC) 3, saxagliptin 4, lenvatinib 5 and tasimelteon 6 are examples of some biologically active natural products, whose total synthesis involve Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation as the main step. The structures of these heterocyclic scaffolds are given below (Figure 3) [19][20][21][22][23].

Moreover, Simmons-Smith reagent is also involved in the efficient asymmetric cyclopropanations of various other heterocyclic scaffolds, such as bicyclic olefins (e.g., bicyclo [2.2.l] heptene and bicyclo [2.2.ll] heptadiene) [8] and a variety of chiral auxiliaries including chiral ketals, allylic alcohols, allylic ethers, enol ethers, chiral enamides and vinyl boronic esters [3,24,25]. However, in this review, we have summarized the scope of the Furukawa variant of Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation toward the synthesis of natural products and some drugs.

However, in this review, we have summarized the scope of the Furukawa variant of Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation toward the synthesis of natural products and some drugs. Vinblastine and vincristine (former derivative of vinblastine) belong to the class of "bisindole" alkaloids, also known as dimeric alkaloids. These are isolated from the Madagascar periwinkle plant Catharanthus roseus. Two monomers of these alkaloids are vindoline and catharanthine. Both vinblastine and vincistine are anti-microtubule drugs, used in the treatment of various kinds of cancer, which is a leading cause of death worldwide [26][27][28]. Vinblastine is used for the treatment of head and neck cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Vincristine is specialized for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and nephroblastoma [29]. The attractive pharmacological profile of these two dimeric alkaloids prompted researchers to synthesize their derivatives and evaluate their biological activities. Keglevich et al. in 2015 synthesized amino acid derivatives of both vinblastine and vincristine by coupling a cyclopropanated (C14 and C15 position) vindoline part with (D)-and (L)-tryptophan methyl esters (at C16 position) [30]. In their synthetic route, vindoline 7 was brominated by treating with NBS to produce bromovindoline 8. Compound 8 was then cyclopropanated in a stereospecific manner by using Simmons-Smith reagent, i.e., diethylzinc, diiodomethane and dichloromethane at 0 • C, and then raising the temperature up to 25 • C, which furnished vindoline derivative 9 with a successfully installed cyclopropane ring. Compound 9 was then treated with N 2 H 4 . H 2 O in the presence of EtOH to form hydrazide, followed by azide formation by using NaNO 2 and HCl in methanol to produce an intermediate, which was proceeded further for coupling with tryptophan methyl ester at 4 • C to afford compounds 10a and 10b, which on subsequent reduction resulted in 11a and 11b. The antitumor activities of the synthesized derivatives (10a, 10b, 11a and 11b) were evaluated in vitro against an HL-60 human leukemic cell line by MIT assay. The IC 50 values of 10a, 10b, 11a and 11b against this cell line were 75.3 µm, 72.6 µm, 77.1 µm and >100 µm, respectively (Scheme 1).

In another route, the cyclopropanated derivative 9 was reduced by using a palladium catalyst in the presence of sodium borohydrate to produce 14,15-cyclopropanovindoline 12.

Compound 12 was then allowed to couple with catharanthine 13 to produce compound 14 in a 51% yield [30]. The treatment of compound 14 with oxalate salt and Fe 2 (ox) 3 resulted in 14,15-cyclopropanaovinblastine 15, which after chromatographic purification produced a 13% yield. The oxidation of compound 15 by using chromium oxide furnished 14,15-cyclopropanovincristine 16 in a 52% yield (Scheme 2). Compounds 15 and 16 were evaluated against 56 different cancer cell lines. Compound 15 showed the best inhibiting effects in the cases of colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and leukemia. Compound 16 showed better results against melanoma, prostate cancer, colon cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines.

In 2018, Keglevich et al., as a continuation of their work, accomplished the stereospecific synthesis of halogenated cyclopropanovindoline derivatives by using the Simmons-Smith protocol [31]. In this synthesis, vindoline derivative 8b was allowed to react with bromoform and iodoform in the presence of diethyl zinc and dichloromethane to furnish 14,15-bromocyclopropanovindoline 17 and 14,15-iodocyclopropanovindoline 18 in 40% and 22% yields, respectively (Scheme 3). In another route, the cyclopropanated derivative 9 was reduced by using a palladium catalyst in the presence of sodium borohydrate to produce 14,15-cyclopropanovindoline 12. Compound 12 was then allowed to couple with catharanthine 13 to produce compound 14 in a 51% yield [30]. The treatment of compound 14 with oxalate salt and Fe2(ox)3 resulted in 14,15-cyclopropanaovinblastine 15, which after chromatographic purification produced a 13% yield. 


#### Kopsia Alkaloids

Lundurines A-D belongs to the class of Kopsia alkaloids. These are isolated from the plants of Kopsia tenuis, which are found in Malaysia [32]. These show structural similarity with indoline alkaloids. The unique molecular architecture of lundurines consists of a hexacyclic ring, an indole ring, an assembly of a three-membered ring (A), a six-membered ring (B) and a seven-membered ring (C) with three stereodefined quaternary centers. Lundurines are effective against the KB cell line with IC50 = 4.6-14.2 μg mL −1 [33]. This attractive heterocyclic scaffold has been the synthetic target of various researchers. Intensive attempts involving the synthesis of lundurine have been reported in the literature; however, none of the synthetic strategies provided lundurine with an absolute configuration of three quaternary stereocenters. Pioneering in this work, Jin et al. in 2014 disclosed the synthetic route toward the efficient and concise synthesis of (−)-lundurine A 26 in a 15-step sequence with a 2% overall yield [34]. The key step in their synthetic route involved Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation, which carefully controlled the stereochemistry at the C2 and C7 positions with simultaneous formation of ring B (six-membered) and ring C (seven-membered). In the first step, the easily available starting material (S)-pyrrolidinone 19 was treated with vinyl magnesium bromide to produce enone 20 in a 72% yield. The enone 20 was then allowed to react with bromo indole 21 under Heck conditions via 4 h reflux to furnish compound 22. The modification of compound 22 in a few steps resulted in a mixture of products 23a and 23b (dr = 1:2.5), among which compound 23b (as a major product after chromatographic separation) was made to react with diethyl zinc and dichloromethane at 25 °C for 20 h via Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation to furnish compound 24 (with a successfully installed cyclopropane ring) in a 63% yield. As the Simmons-Smith reaction proceeded from the upper side of the double bond in the indole ring, the configuration of C2 and C7 was deduced as 2R and 7R, respectively. In the next step, deprotection of compound 24 in the presence of TBAF and THF generated compound 25, followed by subsequent treatment with Martin sulfurane in dichloromethane as a solvent, successfully resulted in the

#### Limonoid Alkaloids

Xylogranatopyridine B 35 belongs to the class of limonoid alkaloids. These are isolated from the leaves of Xylocarpus granatum, found in China [35]. These contain a pyridine ring incorporated in their basic skeleton. This sophisticated heterocyclic scaffold shows fascinating biological activities, among which their role as phosphatase inhibitor is important [36]. Keeping in view the importance of this natural product, Schuppe et al. in 2018 adopted a biomimetic strategy (based on the synthesis of Liebeskind pyridine) toward the synthesis of xylogranatopyridine B 35 and performed its total synthesis in 11 Scheme 4. Total synthesis of (−)-lundurine A.

The key steps entailed a Chan-Lam coupling reaction, benzylic oxidation, a Mukaiyama−Michael reaction and Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation. The oxime 29 (synthesized from 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone 27) and stannane fragment 30 (synthesized from dihydrocarvone 28) were Molecules 2023, 28, 5651 8 of 50 allowed to react in the Chan-Lam coupling conditions (Cu(OAc) 2 and quinuclidine) [38], followed by selective oxidation supported by the addition of Cr(V) complex, which generated ketone 31 in a 56% yield. The α,β-dehydrogenation of ketone 31, on 1 g scale produced intermediate 32 with a 67% yield. Furthermore, the Mukaiyama−Michael reaction of compound 32 afforded compound 33. The next step required selective methylation, for which Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation protocol is well suited. Thus, treating 33 with diethylzinc and CH 2 I 2 with simultaneous deprotection of siloxycyclopropane in the presence of TBSOTf resulted in compound 34, with high diastereoselectivity (>20:1 dr), in a 74% yield. In the last step, compound 34 was treated with Zeise's dimer, i.e., [PtCl 2 (C 2 H 4 )] 2 furnished xylogranatopyridine B 35 in a 69% yield (Scheme 5).

#### Daphniphyllum Alkaloids

Daphniphyllum alkaloids are isolated from genus Daphniphyllum. These alkaloids are famous for exhibiting anti-HIV activities and are further classified into more than 35 sub-families. Daphnimacropodines A-C belong to the daphniglaucin-C-type sub-family of the daphniphyllum alkaloids. Their dynamic structure is based on a tetracyclic ring system with two vicinal quaternary stereodefined centers [39]. As part of the ongoing research on antiviral studies, various groups of researchers including Gao [40] and Hanessian [41] attempted the total synthesis of daphnimacropodines. Chen et al. in 2021 also performed the total synthesis of the tricyclic core skeleton of daphnimacropodine B 43 [42].

The key steps in their synthetic route entailed Robinson annulation, Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction. In their synthetic route, 1,3-cycloheptanedione 36 was allowed to react with aldehyde 37 in the presence of Hantzch ester, L-proline and DCM to produce compound 38. The reaction of compound 38 with methyl vinyl ketone and subsequent treatment with proline (to achieve maximum enantioselectivity) produced an intermediate, which was proceeded further for reaction with CH(OMe) 3 , and subsequent reduction resulted in compound 39. Compound 39 was oxygenated by using oxone and, after suitable protection, produced compound 40 in an excellent yield. In the next step, compound 40 underwent Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation in the presence of CH 2 I 2 , Et 2 Zn and DCM acting as a solvent, resulting in bicyclic intermediate 41 (in a 77% yield) with successful installation of two vicinal quaternary stereocenters. Intermediate 41 was then made to undergo a few steps to complete the total synthesis of our desired tricyclic core skeleton 42 of daphnimacropodine B 43 in a 62% yield (Scheme 6).

### Synthesis of Terpenoid-Based Natural Products


#### Indole Terpenoids

Terpendole E 51 belongs to the class of indole diterpenes and is isolated from fungus Albophoma yamanashiensis. It is the first natural mitotic kinesin Eg5 inhibitor [43], which acts as a weak ACAT (acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase) inhibitor [44]. Teranishi et al. in 2014 performed the first synthesis of the racemate of terpendole E over 13 steps, with a 13% yield [45]. In their methodology, compound 44 was silylated using TBSOTf to result in the desilylated product 45 (in an 89% yield over two steps). The reaction of compound 45 with reagent 46, followed by hydrolysis at C16, produced compound 47. In the next step, cyclization occurred, followed by reduction, to yield compound 48.

In 2007, Jiao et al. disclosed an efficient, concise and straightforward strategy for the diastereoselective synthesis of hirsutene 77 and 1-desoxyhypnophilin 79 in eight-step (11% overall yield) and nine-step (13% overall yield) sequences, respectively [57]. The key steps for the synthesis of intermediate 75 (with desired stereochemistry at two quaternary stereodefined centers) entailed HWE olefination, Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation and rhodium-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction. Their synthesis commenced with the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction of dimethylhexenal 70 (as an easily available starting material) with phosphonate carbanion 71, which afforded compound 72 in an 87% yield. Compound 72 was then silylated to produce compound 73, which proceeded further toward chemoselective cyclopropanation in the presence of diethyl zinc and diiodomethane (Simmons-Smith protocol) to obtain compound 74 in an 86% yield. In the next step, Rh-catalyzed (5+2+1) cycloaddition of compound 74, followed by aldol condensation, resulted in intermediate 75 in a 62% yield. For the synthesis of hirsutene 77, intermediate 75 proceeded to acylation (in the presence of methyl oxalyl chloride and DMAP) to produce compound 76 in a 92% yield. Deoxygenation of compound 76 and a subsequent Wittig reaction completed the total synthesis of our desired compound 77 in a quantitative yield. In another route, a Wittig reaction of intermediate 76 afforded compound 78 in an 85% yield.

Their synthesis began with the reduction of Hajos Parrish ketone 80 (starting material), then treatment with Dess-Martin periodinane and subsequent protection via (TMSOCH 2 ) 2 , resulting in compound 81 in a 92% yield. Saegusa oxidation of ketone 81, followed by epoxidation and subsequent Wharton transposition, furnished compound 82 in a 60% yield. In the next step, the stereochemistry at the C-10 methyl group was carefully controlled by hydroxyl-induced Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation in the presence of diethyl zinc and diiodomethane to furnish compound 83 with excellent diastereoselectivity and successful installation of five stereocenters. Furthermore, desilylation in the presence of TBSOTf and removal of the glycol group transformed compound 83 into compound 85, which over a few steps furnished our desired compound (Scheme 13).

(+)-Chloranthalactone F 89 belongs to the class of lindenane sesquiterpenoids (dimers). These are isolated from the chloranthus glaber plant [61]. Their structural framework comprises two cyclopropane rings, a cyclobutane ring, two double bonds present outside the ring and twelve stereogenic centers [62]. In 2012, Qian and Zhao revealed the enantioselective synthesis of (+)-chloranthalactone F 89 in 14 steps [63]. The main steps of their synthetic scheme involved Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation and chromiumtrioxide-catalyzed oxidative lactonization followed by oxidative enol-lactonization. The cyclopropanated compound 83 (which was synthesized via employment of Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation, as shown in Scheme 13) was oxidized in the presence of Dess-Martin periodinane and NaHCO 3 , followed by methylation in the presence of reagent 87 to obtain compound 88. After a few steps, successful synthesis of the final product 89 (with a 92% overall yield) was achieved (Scheme 14).

In 2018, Ferrer and Echavarren [66] proposed the first total synthesis of repraesentin F 96 over 16 steps, in a 2% overall yield, by employing Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation and gold-catalyzed cyclization as key steps. The synthesis commenced with dimethyl malonate 90 as a starting material, which was modified into 1,6-enyne 91 over a few steps. Compound 91 was then treated with TBSOTf and triethyl amine, followed by the addition of Simmons-Smith reagent, i.e., diethyl zinc, diiodomethane and dichloromethane, at a temperature below 0 • C, which furnished compound 92 with the successful incorporation of a cyclopropane ring. In the next step, deprotection in the presence of the base and subsequent acylation produced compound 93 (in a 68% yield), which proceeded further via gold-catalyzed cyclization by adding 5 mol% of catalyst 94 to furnish compounds 95a and 95b in 72% and 75% respective yields (with d.r = 7.2:1).

Sordarin 118 was first isolated from Sordaria araneosa, a fungus, in 1971. It exhibits antifungal activities against Candida albicans [70]. The complex molecular architecture of sordarin 118 consists of a tetracyclic core, named sordaricin 115. Sordaricin 115 belongs to the class of diterpenes. Its structure is based on a norbornene framework with three adjacent stereogenic centers [71]. Considering the unique structural features and interesting biological activities of sordarin 118, in 2006, Chiba et al. planned and reported its total synthesis [72]. To perform this task, optically active cyclohexanone (+)-107 was allowed to react with 3-butenylmagnesium bromide 108 under given conditions to produce compound 109. In the next step, Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation of compound 109 (in the presence of diethyl zinc and diiodomethane) and subsequent treatment with the base for desilylation resulted in cyclopropanol 110 in an 82% yield. Compound 110 was processed further for a cyclopropanol ring opening and oxidative radical cyclization in the presence of silver nitrate and 1,4 cyclohexadiene to furnish compound 111 in an 85% yield. The synthesis of tricyclic intermediate 113 (in a 70% yield) involved reaction of ketone 111 with N,N-dimethylhydrazine to produce N,N-dimethylhydrazone (intermediate), processed by reaction with compound 112 followed by acetonide deprotection and subsequent condensation in the presence of sodium ethanoate. Over a few steps, intermediate 113 was transformed into compound 114, which upon deethylation resulted in sordaricin 115. For the synthesis of sordarin 118, Mukaiyama's coupling of sordaricin ethyl ester 114 with glycosyl fluoride 116 and subsequent treatment with DDQ was performed, which furnished a mixture of α-117 and β-117 as a major product in 12% and 79% yields, respectively, with a good diastereoselective ratio (dr = 6.5:1). In the next step, β-117 was subjected to deprotection in the presence of EtONa, and subsequent deethylation completed the synthesis of sordarin 118 (Scheme 17).

Trachylobanes (125a and 125b), kaurane 127, atisane 128 and beyerane 129 belong to the class of polycyclic diterpenes [73,74]. These tetracyclic diterpenes exhibit promising biological activities. In 2006, Abad et al. revealed a synthetic route toward the synthesis of these fascinating heterocycles [75]. Their methodology was based on the synthesis of common intermediate 124 by employing Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation as a key step. In the first step, the (R)-carvone 119 (as a starting material) was reacted with acetaldehyde, which then underwent Swern oxidation to produce β-diketone 120 (in a 93% yield). Compound 120 was processed by treatment with NaH and Bu 4 NHSO 4 in DMF, followed by alkylation and subsequent acidic hydrolysis in the presence of PPTS, resulting in compound 121. In the next step, a Wittig reaction of compound 121 followed by Wittig methylation and a subsequent Diels Alder reaction furnished compound 122 in a 95% yield. Compound 122 was then transformed into compound 123 under the given conditions. In the next step, the well-suited Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation protocol was applied by adding diethyl zinc and diiodomethane in the presence of toluene, furnishing the desired intermediate 124.

For the synthesis of trachylobanes (125a and 125b), regioselective reduction of intermediate 124 was performed by using hydrogen gas in the presence of platinum as a catalyst and AcOH as a solvent, thus resulting in a mixture of 125a and 125b in a 95% (combined) yield. In the following step, compound 125a was modified into compound 126 under the given conditions. Compound 126 was processed by oxidation in the presence of Dess-Martin periodinane, followed by hydrolysis and treatment with liquid ammonia in the presence of THF, and subsequent acetylation furnished kaurane 127 in an excellent yield. For the synthesis of atisane 128, compound 125a was reduced in the presence of lithium aluminum hydride and then subsequently mesylated, while in another route, 125a was treated with liquid ammonia to furnish the desired beyerane 129 in an 85% yield (Scheme 18). 


#### Triterpenoids

Octanorcucurbitacin B 138 belongs to the class of cucurbitane triterpenoids. These are isolated from the plants of Momordica charantia [76]. The cucurbitane class of triterpenoids are important for exhibiting anti-inflammatory, antitumor and anti-HIV activities. These show structural similarity with euphanes and lanostanes as far as possessing tetracyclic skeletons with three stereocenters. In the case of cucurbitanes, these three quaternary centers are present at the C9, C13 and C14 positions [77,78]. Previous approaches toward the synthesis of octanocucurbitacin were based on cationic-rearrangement-mediated derivatization of lanostanes. However, lanostanes were not readily available starting materials. In 2022, Bucknam et al. accomplished the stereoselective synthesis of octanorcucurbitacin B 138 from readily available chiral enyne 130 in 12 steps with a 0.8% overall yield [79]. In their synthetic strategy, compound 130 was allowed to react with TMS-propyne 131, and then protodesilylation produced compound 132. In order to generate a stereocenter at the C9 position, compound 132 underwent a Heck reaction to produce polyunsaturated tetracycle 133. In the next three steps, oxidation (by using Dess-Martin periodinane), isomerization (in the presence of DBU) and subsequent reduction (in the presence of NaBH 4 ) were performed to furnish compound 135 with a stereocenter at C8. The development of a C14 stereocenter was somehow difficult; hence, the Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation strategy was employed to achieve this task. Compound 135 was reacted with diethylzinc and diiodomethane to produce compound 136 as a single regioisomer in a 75% yield. In the next step, oxidation of compound 136 and subsequent reduction (in the presence of lithium in ammonia) successfully generated compound 137 with a chiral center at C14. In the next few steps, a series of oxidation and reduction reactions were performed to furnish our desired natural product 138 in a good yield (Scheme 19).

### Synthesis of Amino-Acid-Based Natural Products

The tricyclopropylamino acid derivative is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) 145 consisting of proline and tricyclopropylamino acid. It is expected to be used in the treatment of hepatitis C [80]. Previously, tricyclopropylamino acid was synthesized by palladiumcatalyzed cyclopropanation reactions in the presence of diazomethane. However, using diazomethane on a kilogram scale was not a good choice because of its hazardous nature. Another common problem faced by many researchers during API 145 synthesis was incomplete cyclopropanation that resulted in alkene impurity [81]. Young et al. investigated many strategies for large-scale synthesis of compound 145 in high purity [82]. In 2016, they designed a useful strategy by employing the use of well-suited Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation as a key step with an additional aminoacetoxylation process. In their synthetic route,  [85]. The overall yield was 5% with good control of chirality. In their methodology, compound 146, under the given conditions (a Wittig reaction and treatment with Tebbe's reagent), was modified into compound (S)-147 in a 25% yield with ee > 98%. In the next step, the Simmons-Smith protocol was  [85]. The overall yield was 5% with good control of chirality. In their methodology, compound 146, under the given conditions (a Wittig reaction and treatment with Tebbe's reagent), was modified into compound (S)-147 in a 25% yield with ee > 98%. In the next step, the Simmons-Smith protocol was employed, for which com- Boc-protected 4,5-methano-β-proline (157a & 157b) is another analogue of β-amino acid. It is used in the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs, i.e., saxagliptin [86,87]. In 2014, Tymtsunik et al. [88] performed the diastereomeric synthesis of Boc-protected 4,5-methano-β-proline (157a & 157b) by employing the Furukawa variation of Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation as a key step. Itaconic acid 152 was used as a starting material, and the overall yields of resulting cis and trans isomers were 11% and 38%, respectively (total of 49%). In the first step, itaconic acid 152 was allowed to react with O-benzylhydroxylamine 153 (acting as nucleophile) to produce compound 154. Over a few steps, compound 155 was allowed to react with 2.5 moles of ZnEt2 and 2.55 moles of ClCH2I in CH2Cl2 acting as a solvent, followed by hydrolysis and reaction with allyl bromide to produce a diastereoisomeric mixture of compounds 156a and 516b (after chromatographic separation). In the last step, deprotection of compounds 156a and 156b in the presence of Pd2(dba)3 and PPh3 furnished Boc-protected proline derivatives 157a (87%) and 157b (92%), respectively (Scheme 22). Boc-protected 4,5-methano-β-proline (157a & 157b) is another analogue of β-amino acid. It is used in the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs, i.e., saxagliptin [86,87]. In 2014, Tymtsunik et al.

In the last step, deprotection of compounds 156a and 156b in the presence of Pd 2 (dba) 3 and PPh 3 furnished Boc-protected proline derivatives 157a (87%) and 157b (92%), respectively (Scheme 22).

3,4-methanonipecotic acid 163 is a cyclopropyl ring containing non-proteinogenic β-amino acid [89]. This compound is rarely present in higher organisms and is usually isolated from plants and bacterial sources. β-amino acids, after incorporation into peptides, show interesting conformational behavior, which prompted researchers to design the various structural analogues of these amino acids. Compound 164 (a derivative of 3,4-methanonipecotic acid 163) is an antagonist of the NK1 receptor; thus, it exhibits potent biological activities [90]. In 2015, Tymtsunik et al. developed a novel approach for the synthesis of racemic 3,4-methanonipecotic acid 163 by using 3-pyridinylmethanol 158 as a starting material [91]. The synthesis was performed via an eight-step sequence (in a 38% overall yield) by employing Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation as a key step. The treatment of alcohol 158 with Grignard reagent and subsequent reduction produced alcohol 159. In the next step, compound 159 was processed by treatment with 4 moles of ZnEt 2 and 4 moles of CH 2 I 2 to yield compound 160 (with a successfully installed cyclopropane ring) in a 53% yield. In the next step, compound 160 was converted into compound 162 (in a 73% yield) over three steps involving reduction, followed by treatment with Dess-Martin periodinane and subsequent Pinnick oxidation (in the presence of 2-methyl-2-butene, NaClO 2 and NaH 2 PO 4 ). In the final step, deprotection of compound 162 via HCl furnished 3,4-methanonipecotic acid 163 in a 98% yield (Scheme 23).

JP4-039 is an isostere dipeptide comprised of leucine and glycine residue [92]. Its structure possesses peptidomimetic properties and has the ability to interact with mitochondria and operate as a bioprotective and anti-oxidant agent [93]. In 2011, Frantz et al. designed an efficient and easily scaled route toward the synthesis of β, γ-cyclopropylamine isosteres 172 (analogue of JP4-039) [94]. In their synthetic route, compound (S)-169 was obtained by hydrozirconation of alkyne 165 and simultaneous transmetalation, followed by reaction with chiral imine (R)-168 (from isovaleraldehyde). In the next step, Cbz protection of allylic sulfinyl amine was performed to produce (S)-170. For cyclopropanation, compound (S)-170 was treated with diethyl zinc and dichloromethane (Simmons-Smith reagent) at −20 • C and then with slight heating up to room temperature, followed by chromatographic separation, resulting in compound 171 in a 65% yield with dr >20:1. In the following step, compound 171 was treated with TBAF, followed by Jones oxidation and subsequent 4-AT coupling, furnishing our desired JP4-039 analogue 172 (over three steps) in a 68% yield (Scheme 24).

Methanoprolines belong to the class of amino acids; they have great medicinal importance and are expected to show anti-HCV activities [95,96]. In 2013, Wang et al. devised a new and efficient synthetic route for the synthesis of trans-methanoproline 177a in high stereoselectivity [97]. Their synthesis commenced with readily available starting material 173, which was modified into compound 174 in a few steps. In order to introduce a cyclopropane ring, a well-suited Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation was performed by treating compound 174 with Et 2 Zn and ICH 2 Cl in toulene at −17 • C to furnish a mixture of compounds 175a and 175b in an 84% yield. In the next step, silyl group deprotection of compounds 175a and 175b, followed by oxidation in the presence of sodium periodate and ruthenium chloride, furnished compounds 177a, 177b and 178 in a 1.0:0.04:0.18 mol ratio, respectively. After that, recrystallization was performed in order to achieve the desired compound 177a in high stereoselectivity (Scheme 25). 3,4-methanonipecotic acid 163 is a cyclopropyl ring containing non-proteinogenic β-amino acid [89].

The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) dual modulators have previously been reported. These modulators can be used in the treatment of hypoadiponectinemia (a metabolic disease) and cancer [101,102]. These PPARδ antagonists and PPARγ partial agonists work by interacting with polymerases and adenosine receptors and inactivating them. Considering the importance of PPAR modulators, various attempts have been made for the synthesis of methanocarba nucleosides, but previous approaches for the synthesis of these nucleosides faced the problem of low yield. However, Hyuan et al. in 2021 performed the stereoselective synthesis of homologated (S)-and (N)-methanocarba nucleosides on a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane template and observed the conformational behavior of these analogues for binding with PPAR [103]. The key step in the synthesis of (N) conformer involved Simmons−Smith cyclopropanation and a Mitsunobu reaction [104]. In their synthetic route, D-Ribose 188 was used as the starting material, which after few modifications produced compound 189. The substrate-controlled Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation of diol 189 in the presence of diethyl zinc, diiodomethane and dichloromethane at 0 • C to rt produced compound 190 with a 40% yield. Compound 190 was then acetylated by treating with Ac 2 O, Et 3 N and DMAP in the presence of dichloromethane at 0 • C to 23 • C, yielding compound 191 in a 76% yield. After a few steps, the synthesis of homologated (N)-methanocarba nucleosides 192 was completed with 58% overall yield, respectively (Scheme 27).

### Synthesis of Nucleosides

20-deoxy-20-fluoro-20-C-methyl spiro cyclopentyl carbocyclic uridine belongs to the class of carbocyclic nucleosides, which are well known for their anticancer properties [105]. These nucleosides are generated by substituting oxygen in a furanose ring with carbon, and subsequent condensation with a base results in more stable nucleosides [106]. In 2020, Singh and Chu performed the synthesis of 1-(4 R,5S,6R,7R)-5,6-dihydroxy-7-(hydroxymethyl)spiro[2.4]heptan-4-yl)pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione 199 and its analogues and evaluated their anti-HCV activity [107]. Triol 193 (as a starting material) was modified into β-allylic alcohol 194 over a few steps. The oxidation of β-allylic alcohol 194 in the presence of Dess-Martin periodinane and dichloromethane produced α-allylic alcohol 195 (in an 88% yield), which upon subsequent reduction in the presence of sodium borohydride and cesium chloride produced compound 196 in an 87% yield. Compound 196 was cyclopropanated under the Simmons-Smith conditions, i.e., diethyl zinc, diiodomethane and diethyl ether, to furnish compound 197 in a 93% yield. Compound 197 was treated with Mitsunobu conditions [104], i.e., DPPA, DIAD and TPP in THF, to produce β-azide, which on subsequent reduction and then treatment with β-methoxy acryloyl isocyanate produced compound 198 in an 81% yield. The cyclization of compound 198 was performed in the presence of 2 N sulfuric acid to produce uridine analogue 199 successfully in a 37% yield.  [110]. The synthesis was performed in 16 steps by using a readily available starting material, i.e., D-xylose derivative 203. This acetonide-protected derivative 203, after modifications in a few steps, produced protected 3-hydroxymethyl 2-ketofuranoside 204. In the next step, the carbonyl group of derivative 204 was subjected to silyl protection in the presence of LDA, TBSCl, Et 3 N and THF at −30 • C to rt to produce benzyl-protected silyl enol ether in an 80% yield. Furthermore, Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation was performed according to the previously devised method of Gerber and Vogel, in which compound 205 was treated with diethyl zinc, ClCH 2 I and DCE to furnish compound 206 in a 60% yield and dr = 8:1. The modification of compound 206 over a few steps completed the synthesis of uridine 207 (Scheme 29).

In 2019, Kollmann et al. successfully synthesized 4 /5 -spirocyclopropanated uridine derivatives with a 5 hydroxy substitution pattern using Furukawa-modified Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation as a key step [113]. In their methodology, O-silylated nucleoside 208 (as a starting material) was treated with six equivalents of BOMCl and five equivalents of N i Pr 2 Et at about 0 • C to room temperature, and subsequent treatment with TBAF produced compound 209 over two steps with an 87% yield. Oxidation of compound 209 by using IBX followed by enolization with K 2 CO 3 produced compound 210. After this, compound 210 underwent Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation in the presence of diethyl zinc, diiodomethane and DCE at 50 • C to produce compound 211 (in a 54% yield). In the following step, compound 211 was reduced by using Pd/C and methanol, which successfully yielded intermediate 212.

### Synthesis of Polyketide-Based Natural Product

Clavosolide A 251 belongs to the class of polyketides. Polyketides are natura metabolites, having large structural diversity and being renowned for exhibiting a large number of biological activities. Various synthetic strategies have previously been employed for the synthesis of the core structure of these metabolites, involving double Sakurai allylation [123], Mitsunobu reaction [104] and alkyne metathesis [124,125], but these strategies produced a large amount of waste and were not considered appropriate with respect to atom economy. In 2015, Haydl and Breit introduced a new atom-economical, regioselective strategical procedure for the synthesis of a 16-membered skeleton of clavosolide A in eight steps [126]. The key steps involved the rhodium-catalyzed addition of carboxylic acid to alkene, cross metathesis and late-stage Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation. Compounds 247 and 248 were reacted over a few

In 2015, Haydl and Breit introduced a new, atom-economical, regioselective strategical procedure for the synthesis of a 16-membered skeleton of clavosolide A in eight steps [126]. The key steps involved the rhodium-catalyzed addition of car-boxylic acid to alkene, cross metathesis and late-stage Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation. Compounds 247 and 248 were reacted over a few steps to produce allenyl-substituted carboxylic acid 249. Fragment 300 underwent head-to-tail rhodium-catalyzed dimerization to produce compound 250 in an 82% yield with good diastereoselectivity. In the next step, cross metathesis of compound 250 was performed in the presence of Grubbs catalyst in (Z)-butene to produce an intermediate in an 89% yield (E/Z = 83/17), which was processed by Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation in the presence of diethyl zinc, ICH 2 Cl and CH 2 Cl 2 to result in the successful synthesis of clavosolide A 251 in a 63% yield (Scheme 34).

These metabolites have unique structural features with cyclopropane rings at C-9 and C-10. Different members of this class show diversity in their configurational behaviors, which makes their synthesis challenging and curious.

### Synthesis of Drugs

Octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine A 288 is an effective anticancer agent, as it is an IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) antagonist. IAPs cause resistance to several chemotherapeutic drugs [132]. The tricyclic framework of octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine A has the ability to interact with IAPs via van der Waal forces, which promote cell death. However, octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine A 288 was found to be metabolically less stable [133]. The interesting biomimetic behavior of this heterocyclic scaffold prompted synthetic efforts toward the synthesis of its derivatives with improved metabolic stability. In 2013, Asano et al. disclosed the enantioselective synthesis of a cyclopropane ring containing derivatives of octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine A with an improved PK profile and better cytotoxic activities against cancer cells [134]. Their methodology commenced with the synthesis of the methyl ester derivative 281 of proline from the readily available starting material 280. In order to install a cyclopropane ring, compound 281 was treated with Simmons-Smith conditions, i.e., diethyl zinc and dichloromethane in the presence of toluene. The temperature was initially kept at 0 • C and then raised slowly to room temperature, resulting in a diastereomeric mixture of compounds 282 and 283 in 39% and 7% yields, respectively (after chromatographic separation). After that, 282 and 283 were reduced in the presence of lithium aluminum hydride and subsequent oxidation in the presence of sulfur trioxide and pyridine complex, followed by reduction with benzyl amine, resulting in intermediates 284 and 285 in 85% and 68% yields, respectively. Over a few steps, intermediates 284 and 285 were converted into octahydro-1H-cyclopropa [4,5]pyrrolo [1,2a]pyrazine derivatives 286 and 287 in quantitative yields (Scheme 39). Both of the synthesized derivatives showed better metabolic stability. Moreover, derivative 287 exhibited antiproliferative activity against human breast cancer cells.

For the synthesis of 315 in high yield, a synthetic route was adopted in which compound 310 was allowed to react with propargyl bromide 311 in the presence of a base under reflux for 4 h to produce compound 312 in 95% and 80% yields, respectively. In the next step, a Wittig reaction was performed to produce compound 313, followed by oxidation in the presence of m-CPBA and dichloromethane, which furnished an inseparable mixture of diastereomers (314 and 314 / ). Subsequently, compound 314 was treated with HCl, water and DCM to furnish the bicyclic lactone 315. Later, silver-catalyzed cyclization of compound 315 in the presence of benzene at 60 • C yielded compound 316 in a 64% yield. In the last step, the Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation of compound 316 in the presence of diethylzinc and diiodomethane at 40 • C, under reflux condition, furnished our desired compound 317 in a 79% yield (Scheme 43).

Cibenzoline 321 is an anti-arrhythmic drug. Its structure contains two benzene rings, one imidazoline ring and a cyclopropane ring with a stereogenic carbon [147]. Considering its biological importance, Miura et al. [148] in 2006 performed the synthesis of cibenzoline and its analogues by employing sulfonamide-catalyzed enantioselective Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation. In their methodology, 3,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ols 318 was treated with diethyl zinc, diiodomethane and dichloromethane in the presence of a catalytic amount of (S)-phenylalanine-derived disulfonamide 319 to furnish cyclopropylmethanol 320 in an 82% yield with 76% enantioselectivity. Over a few steps, compound 320 was modified into (+)-cibenzoline 321 with a 55% yield (Scheme 44).

Over a few steps, compound 320 was modified into (+)-cibenzoline 321 with a 55% yield (Scheme 44). Tranylcypromine and milnacipran (cyclopropane-based amines) are strong antidepressants. Tranylcypromine is also an anxiolytic agent, thus is effective for the treatment of anxiety and mood disorders [149]. Milnacipran is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The stereospecific analogues of both these compounds are expected to show more interesting biological and therapeutic activities [150]. In 2013, Ishizuka et al. performed the asymmetric synthesis of (+)-tranylcypromine 326 (in a 22% overall yield) and (−)-milnacipran hydrochloride 331 (in a 14% overall yield) by employing sulfonamide-catalyzed enantioselective Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation as a key step [151]. For the synthesis of (+)-tranylcypromine 326, trans-cinnamyl alcohol 322 (as a starting material) was treated with two equivalents of diethyl zinc, three equivalents of diiodomethane in the presence of sulfonamide catalyst 323 and diiodomethane as a solvent at 0 °C to furnish compound 324 in an 87% yield with 84% ee. After asymmetric sulfonamide Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation, compound 324 was oxidized by using Jones reagent, followed by treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide to furnish compound 325.

## Conclusions

The concise and stereospecific synthesis of cyclopropane-based natural products with exact configuration of their stereogenic centers by employing Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation has been highlighted throughout this review. Previous strategies for Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation were limited to the use of zinc metal along with diiodomethane. With the passage of time, various modifications have been made and reported in the Simmons-Smith reagent, such as the Denmark modification (Et 2 Zn and ClCH 2 Cl), Furukawa modification (Et 2 Zn and CH 2 Cl 2 ) and Charette modification (bipy. Zn(CH 2 I) 2 complex). However, the synthetic strategies discussed in this review are based on the Furukawa modification (Et 2 Zn and CH 2 Cl 2 ). Furukawa-modified Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is efficient and is the most preferred strategy in modern organic synthesis, as it retains all characteristics (that are present in classical ones) and can be applied over a wide range of temperature. The panoramic features of this reaction entail a broad range of substrate compatibility, hydroxylsubstituted directing effect, good enantiocontrol, minimum handling and purification difficulties, maximum yield and the generation of a complex molecular architecture with desired stereochemistry. The enantioselective synthesis of some polycyclic structures has also been reported by employing Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation via a one-pot synthetic strategy. Although much effort has been put into methodology development, as well as the synthetic applications of Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation, by various research groups, the authors nevertheless believe that there is still a great vacuum in its applications toward pharmaceutically important molecules. Moreover, the Simmons-Smith-cyclopropanationbased synthetic schemes discussed herein would open up new routes toward the synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds in medicinal chemistry.

Compound 140/141 was then reacted with a Boc-protected proline derivative in the given conditions to obtain compound 143/144 and processed by treatment with PhI(OAc) 2 , Pd(OAc) 2 and N(Bu) 4 OAc, and the subsequent addition of N-methyl thiourea resulted in the desired compound API 145 in an 85-90% yield.

Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 26 of 57 by palladium-catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions in the presence of diazomethane. However, using diazomethane on a kilogram scale was not a good choice because of its hazardous nature. Another common problem faced by many researchers during API 145 synthesis was incomplete cyclopropanation that resulted in alkene impurity [81]. Young et al. investigated many strategies for large-scale synthesis of compound 145 in high purity [82]. In 2016, they designed a useful strategy by employing the use of well-suited Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation as a key step with an additional aminoacetoxylation process.

2-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane is a basic heterocyclic scaffold for the synthesis of various nucleoside analogues, as these show potent biological activities. The synthesis of these nucleosides involve glycosylation reactions between sugars bearing 2-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and nitrogenous bases. Conformational studies of these nucleosides and sugar-puckering phenomena are important, as these effect the metabolic behavior and interaction of these nucleosides with various polymerases [98]. Keeping in view the biological importance of nucleosides, Gangeron et al. in 2005 performed the synthesis of five 2-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-based natural nucleic acid bases [99]. Their synthesis involved glycosylation reactions between sugars bearing 2-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and nitrogenous bases starting from L-xylose 179. Compound 180 was obtained after the modification of L-xylose. Then, the Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation of compound 180 resulted in a mixture of major product 181a (91% yield) and minor product 181b (1.5% yield). Compound 181a after modification over a few steps produced compound 182. The glycosylation reaction of compound 182 in the presence of pyrimidine at 0 °C followed by deprotection in the presence of MeOH and NH3 produced nucleosides 183, 184 and 185. In another route, glycosylation reaction of compound 182 in the presence of adenine and tin chloride followed by deprotection produced nucleoside 186, while guanosine nucleoside 187 was prepared by condensation of 182 with 2-N-acetyl-6-O-(diphenylcarbamoyl)guanine in the presence of toluene and subsequent deprotection in the presence of MeOH and NH3.

The oxidation of compound 15 by using chromium oxide furnished 14,15-cyclopropanovincristine 16 in a 52% yield (Scheme 2). Compounds 15 and 16 were evaluated against 56 different cancer cell lines. Compound 15 showed the best inhibiting effects in the cases of colon cancer, Scheme 1. Synthesis of amino acid derivative of vindoline. lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and leukemia. Compound 16 showed better results against melanoma, prostate cancer, colon cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines. In 2018, Keglevich et al., as a continuation of their work, accomplished the stereospecific synthesis of halogenated cyclopropanovindoline derivatives by using the Simmons-Smith protocol [31]. In this synthesis, vindoline derivative 8b was allowed to react with bromoform and iodoform in the presence of diethyl zinc and dichloromethane to furnish 14,15-bromocyclopropanovindoline 17 and 14,15-iodocyclopropanovindoline 18 in 40% and 22% yields, respectively (Scheme 3).
