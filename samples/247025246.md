Attitudes towards open-label versus placebo-control designs in oncology randomized trials: A survey of medical oncologists
10.1111/jep.13669Received: 27 July 2021 | Revised: 24 January 2022 | Accepted: 25 January 2022O R I G I N A L P A P E R
Rationale, Aims and Objectives: Randomized trials are considered the gold standard when assessing the efficacy of new therapeutic agents. In clinical situations where no standard of care therapy is approved, randomized trials usually compare experimental agents to either a placebo or an open-label nonintervention arm (i.e., best supportive care). We surveyed Canadian medical oncologists to understand their attitudes towards each design. Methods: Members of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. Standardized case scenarios were used to determine participants' attitudes regarding the role of open-label versus placebo-controlled trials. Results: A total of 322 medical oncologists and trainees were invited to participate and 86 responded (response rate 27%). Fifty-one (59%) believed that open-label trials are an acceptable alternative to placebo-controlled design when investigating a therapeutic agent in the adjuvant setting. Thirty-eight (49%) deemed it acceptable to compare the investigational agent to an open-label arm instead of a placebo to assess progression-free survival in the metastatic setting. Twenty-eight (38%) of respondents felt that open-label design was acceptable when assessing the quality of life endpoint. Most physicians were unsure whether the US Food and Drug Administration require a placebo-controlled arm in oncology trials. Conclusion: Canadian medical oncologists participating in this survey are divided in their opinions regarding the acceptability of an open-label design in randomizedcontrolled trials, where no standard therapy is approved. Clearer guidance from regulatory bodies on the adequacy of different trial designs is needed.

# | INTRODUCTION

Properly conducted, randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered the gold standard study design to assess the efficacy of any new pharmaceutical agent. 1 Placebo-controlled trials are important because they help to differentiate between the benefits and safety of an experimental treatment versus those associated with the placebo effect or patients' underlying disease. 2 However, this trial design is considered ethical if no efficacious comparative treatment is available and participants receiving the placebo are not subjected to any additional risk of serious or irreversible harm. 1,3,4 Due to variations in reporting of symptoms, a placebo arm can be especially important in trials assessing subjective endpoints such as relief of pain. Unfortunately, in addition to missing any potential benefit of the investigational treatment arm, patients randomized to the placebo arm often suffer inconveniences of being on placebo including travel expenses, multiple appointments, work absence and loss of income and venipuncture. 5,6 An open-label noninterventional arm (i.e., best supportive care) can be an alternative to a placebo arm in clinical trials when no effective comparative therapy is available. 7 Noninterventional arm trials limit unnecessary inconveniences to patients as opposed to placebo-controlled trials and are more appealing to patients, which in turn may improve recruitment, though at the expense of important internal validity considerations.

Additionally, they may offer a more affordable alternative to a placebo-controlled trial. 8,9 There is currently a lack of consistency observed in oncology clinical trials, with trials assessing similar endpoints with different designs. For example, adjuvant atezolizumab was assessed in both urothelial carcinoma (IMvigor010, NCT02450331) 10 15 In addition, blinded independent central reviewers can be used to ensure objective evaluation of patient assessments such as imaging. This design is even more relevant when it is difficult to blind investigators from treatment allocation due to well-known or expected toxicity of the investigational agent. 16,17 Our study has several limitations. It is a single country survey.

There is selection bias, as not all Canadian medical oncologists are members of CAMO. In addition, it is possible that not all dependent variables could be evaluated using only three scenarios.

In conclusion, the results of our survey echo the current confusion associated with the use of a noninterventional arm open-label design versus a placebo, double-blind design in oncology clinical trials. We believe that this issue should be addressed by the regulatory bodies using unambiguous language to provide clear guidance to physicians and investigators.

CAMOs) received an electronic invitation to participate in an anonymous online survey. Members were contacted through the CAMO electronic mailing list and provided with a hyperlink to an anonymous online survey linked to a secure database (SurveyMonkey Inc.). An E-mail reminder was sent to potential participants two weeks after the initial invitation.The survey themes and questions were developed, drafted and re-viewed by clinicians and researchers with expertize in medical oncology, clinical trials and survey design from the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and from the Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. To add validity, the survey draft was piloted among 10 medical oncologists from the Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Ottawa, Canada. The results were reviewed and changes were made to make the final survey clearer and conciser. We assessed whether responders consider an open-label design an acceptable or preferable alternative to a placebo-controlled arm using three standardized case scenarios: Scenario A-adjuvant RCT with overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint, Scenario B-RCT in palliative patients, with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint, and Scenario C-RCT in palliative patients, with quality of life as the primary endpoint (Table 1). Responders' reasons to prefer one design over the other in each scenario were further evaluated. In addition, the survey consisted of questions assessing responders' demographics and their attitude towards recruitment of patients to clinical trials with an oral or intravenous placebo arm, whether any of their patients declined participating in a clinical trial because they were afraid of being randomized to a placebo arm, and whether they believe an open-label design would result in higher patient dropout. Survey responses were summarized with frequencies and percentages. χ 2 Or Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the association between participants' attitude towards the use of a noninterventional arm in the various scenarios, and each of the following variables: number of years in practice (<10 vs. ≥10), sex, place of work (academic, universityaffiliated vs. community practice), and number of patients they recruited to clinical trials in the last year (≤5 vs. >5). A p-value of less than 0.05 was used for statistical significance. A $5 Starbucks voucher was offered upon completing the survey. The survey was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board.


and renal cell carcinoma (IMmotion010, NCT03024996): the latter used a doubleblinded, placebo-controlled design, whereas IMvigor010 used an observation open-label noninterventional arm design. Some practitioners might consider open-label as an invariably inferior trial design. 11 Therefore, in this study, we surveyed Canadian medical oncologists to assess their current attitudes towards open-label noninterventional arm versus placebo-controlled design in oncology clinical trials.


T A B L E 1 Standardized case scenarios used in the survey Scenario A A 52-year-old male patient diagnosed with cancer Y is being enrolled in an adjuvant study of agent X with a primary endpoint of overall survival. Agent X is known to be active in the metastatic setting for cancer Y. There is no standard adjuvant therapy for cancer Y Scenario B A 64-year-old female patient with metastatic cancer Y has exhausted all standard therapies. She is being enrolled in a phase III study for agent Z with a primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Agent Z is known to be active in phase II for cancer Y Scenario C A 64-year-old female patient with metastatic cancer Y has exhausted all standard therapies. She is being enrolled in a phase III study for agent Z with a primary endpoint of the patient's quality of life assessment. Agent Z is known to be active in phase II for cancer Y 3 | RESULTS A total of 322 Canadian medical oncologists and medical oncology trainees participated in the survey and 86 responded (response rate 27%). Participating physicians' demographics are summarized in Table 2. 3.1 | Scenario A: Adjuvant RCT with OS as a primary endpoint In the adjuvant setting, 59% believed that it is acceptable to compare an investigational agent to an open-label rather than a placebo. Among them, 65% believed that an open-label design is as reliable as a double-blind placebo-controlled design for this setting, while 35% When no other efficacious treatment is available, an openlabel noninterventional arm could be considered an acceptable alternative to a placebo arm. Open-label noninterventional arm design overcomes inherent disadvantages that placebocontrolled trials have on patients, such as the inconvenience, pain and possible harm associated with intravenously administered placebo. It can also mitigate some less obvious disadvantages of a placebo-controlled design such as more frequent medical appointments and related travel and time commitments. Frequent medical appointments are known to be associated with financial burden resulting from travel, lodging and childcare expenses and time lost from work, resulting in impaired quality of life. 5,13 However, open-label design can be associated with several limitations such as possible higher patient dropout, concerns regarding the internal validity of the study including possible patients underreporting of adverse events. 14 Some of these concerns can be mitigated by carefully designing the study. Investigators and stakeholders should be aware that an open-label noninterventional arm design should be restricted to studies with objective primary endpoints, such as OS, PFS or disease-free survival, which are less prone to biases resulting from investigator or patient expectations.preferred an open-label design due to concerns that might be asso-

ciated with a placebo-controlled arm. In this scenario, 57% con-

sidered the results of a published study with an open-label design as 

valid as a blinded placebo-controlled design. No association was 

found between participants' acceptance of an open-label design in 

the adjuvant setting, and their number of years in practice (58% 

<10 years vs. 61% ≥10 years; p = 0.76), sex (67% male vs. 51% 

female; p = 0.13), place of work (57% university-affiliated vs. 100% 

community practice; p = 0.08), or number of patients recruited to 

clinical trials in the last year (63% ≤5 patients vs. 57% >5 patients; 

p = 0.64; Table 3). 

3.2 | Scenario B: RCT in palliative patients, with 
PFS as the primary endpoint 

Forty-nine percent of physicians answered that when assessing 

PFS in the metastatic incurable setting, it is acceptable to com-

pare an investigational arm to an open-label rather than a placebo 

arm. Among them, 49% believed that an open-label design is as 

reliable as a placebo-controlled arm, whereas 51% preferred not 

to use a placebo-controlled arm due to concerns inherent to this 

design. In this scenario, 48% of participants would consider the 

results of an open-label study as valid as a blinded placebo-

controlled design. No association was found between partici-

pants' acceptance of an open-label design in assessing PFS in the 

metastatic setting and their number of years in practice (50% 

<10 years vs. 47% ≥10 years; p = 0.82), sex (50% male vs. 46% 

female; p = 0.72), place of work (48% university-affiliated vs. 60% 

community practice; p = 0.67) or the number of patients recruited 

to clinical trials in the last year (48% ≤5 patients vs. 49% >5 

patients; p = 0.95; Table 3).

3.3 | Scenario C: RCT in palliative patients, with 
quality of life as a primary endpoint 

In Scenario C, 38% of participants thought that it is acceptable to use 

an open-label noninterventional arm instead of a placebo-controlled 

trial and 34% would consider the results of a published study with an 

open-label design as valid as a double-blinded placebo-controlled 

design. No association was found between participants' acceptance 

of an open-label design in assessing the quality of life in the palliative 

setting and their number of years in practice (42% <10 years vs. 33% 

≥10 years; p = 0.44), sex (37% male vs. 40% female; p = 0.78), place of 

work (39% university-affiliated vs. 25% community practice; p = 1) or 

the number of patients recruited to clinical trials in the last year (38% 

≤5 patients vs. 38% >5 patients; p = 0.17; Table 3). 

Participants mentioned that the main disadvantages associated 

with a placebo-controlled trial design were patients' time commit-

ment (49/73, 67%), difficulties recruiting due to patients' lack of in-

terest (45/73, 62%), strain on limited public/clinic resources (43/73, 

59%) and potential harm to patients (24/73, 33%). In contrast, 62% 

were concerned that an open-label design would result in a higher 

patient drop-out rate. 

Most physicians agreed that an open-label design would improve 

patient recruitment. Twenty-seven percent mentioned that 

20%-50% of their patients declined to participate in a clinical trial 

because they were afraid to be randomized to an oral placebo arm, 

whereas 34% reported that between 20% and 50% of their patients 

declined because they were afraid to be randomized to an in-

travenous placebo arm. Ninety-two percent of respondents felt 

comfortable recruiting patients to a study with an oral placebo-

controlled arm, while 85% felt comfortable recruiting patients to a 

study with an intravenous placebo arm. 

Most physicians answered that they are unsure whether the US 

Food and Drug Administration requires a placebo-controlled design 

in oncology clinical trials in a setting similar to the three scenarios 

described in this survey (61% for Scenario A, 70% for Scenario B, and 

73% for Scenario C). 

4 | DISCUSSION 

Many patients dislike the possibility of placebo. 12 In our survey, 

many respondents acknowledged that a significant proportion of 

their patients had declined enrollment on a clinical trial because 

of the fear of being randomized to a placebo arm, especially when 

treatment is administered intravenously. Sixty percent of physi-

cians agreed that using a noninterventional arm instead of a 

placebo arm would help recruitment. Yet, our survey demon-

strated that many physicians believe that a noninterventional arm 

is not acceptable and they may not regard the results of such a 

study as reliable as those from a placebo-controlled RCT. The 

proportion of responders regarding an open-label noninterven-

tional arm as an acceptable alternative increases when objective 

study endpoints with less potential confounders, such as OS, are 

used. It is plausible that the lack of clarity from regulatory bodies 

on the appropriateness of open-label noninterventional arm de-

sign contributes to the division in opinions observed in our sur-

vey. In fact, the majority of participants acknowledged not being 

aware of the US Food and Drug Administration's policies on 

placebo arm alternatives.
