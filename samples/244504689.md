Index Terms-WorkflowDSLDSLDomain-Specific LanguageWorkflow
This paper aims to provide an overview of the complete process in the development of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). It explains the construction steps such as preliminary research, language implementation, and evaluation. Moreover, it provides details for different key-components which are commonly found in the DSLs such as the abstraction layer, DSL metamodel and the applications. It also explains the general limitations related to the Domain-Specific Languages for Workflows.

## I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, Scientific Workflows [1] have been intensively applied in astronomy [2], seismology [3], genomics [4], etc. A workflow has a sequence of jobs that perform required functionality and it has control or data dependencies between jobs. Or, as defined by the Workflow Management Coalition, workflow is the automation of a business process, in whole or parts, during which documents, information or tasks are passed from one participant to another for actions, according to a set of procedural rules [5]. Systems like Pegasus [6], Pregel [7], GBase [8], Trinity [9], Hama [10], Giraph [11], HipG [12], PBGL [13], ScaleGraph [14], KDT [15], etc. are a few examples of Big Data workflows.

A DSL, on the other hand, is a "mini" language built on top of a hosting language (such as C, Java, and JavaScript) that provides a common syntax and semantics to represent concepts and behaviors in a particular domain. Maximilien et al., [16], summarized that using or designing a DSL generally helps achieving the high-level linguistic constructs, terse code, simple-and-natural syntax, ease of programming, and code generation. In the research communities of software engineering and programming language, Domain-Specific Language is an important and efficient way to reduce the programming complexity as well as improve the productivity [17]. Essentially, DSL aims to realize the concept of meta programming [18], which makes a program designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running. A DSL that requires itself to be embedded within the host language can be called an Internal DSL. A DSL with its own syntax and that is not required to be embedded within another language can be called an External DSL [19]. One of the biggest advantage of using DSLs is, since they are tailored to a specific application domain, they exploit domain knowledge for productivity and efficiency [20].

It is commonly agreed that the development of custom DSLs and the related model-driven workflows is a complex task that should be addressed with an iterative process [21]. Hence, all kinds of purposes may be fulfilled by domain-specific languages. In diverse ways and among varying kinds of people, they may be used. Some DSLs are designed for programmers to use and are thus more advanced, while others are meant for anyone who is not a programmer to use less geeky concepts and syntax.

This papers covers the following topics related to DSLs for Workflow: Key-components in DSLs for Workflow, major/common construction steps in DSLs for Workflows and the limitations of the DSLs in the workflows. This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, We have described the complete research methodology for this paper in detail. In Section III, we have summarized the answers for each research question in a separate sub-section. In Section IV, we have concluded the research results and have presented the results in a concise form.


## II. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

Jesson et al defines the systematic review as "a review with a clear stated purpose, a question, a defined search approach, stating inclusion and exclusion criteria, producing a qualitative appraisal of articles" [22].

The complete research process is shown in figure 1.


## A. Define the research question

For defining the research question, We initially set a bigger topic of study, Big Data Workflows. It contains multiple sub topics such as Visualization, Workflow Initialization, Workflow specification, Domain-Specific Languages, Cloud infrastructure etc. So for this paper, We focused on the Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) for Workflows.

After reading the relevant literature, following are the research questions we formulated.

1) What are the key-components of a Domain-Specific Language for Workflows? 2) What are common steps in the construction process of a DSL Language for Workflows? 3) What are the limitations of DSLs for Workflows? 


## B. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

We defined the following Inclusion/Exclusion criteria for this paper. Our main research keywords are "DSL", "Workflow", "WorkflowDSL" and "Domain-Specific language". These keywords produced results to help answer the first three research questions. Since we got a lot irrelevant results by searching in "All Metadata" and too few results by searching in title, so we decided to search our terms in Abstract.

For IEEE, we used the following query:

(("Abstract":DSL AND "Abstract":Workflow) OR ("Abstract": "Domain-Specific Language" AND "Abstract":Workflow) OR ("Abstract":WorkflowDSL))

For ACM, we used the following query: 
[

## D. Research Results Overview

In the first round, we analysed the Title and Abstract of the papers. We applied the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and following are the results.  In the second round, We analysed the complete papers to see if they answer at least one of the research question. After the second round, we got the following results:

IEEE: 10 and ACM: 5


## E. Snowball method

Since we could only find a limited number of relevant papers, to compliment the answers of our research questions, we used snowball approach [24] in some articles. It is a way of finding literature by using a key document on the subject as a starting point. Then to find other relevant articles and papers, consult the bibliography in the key document. One disadvantage of this approach is that the literature we find in the bibliography, might be old. To overcome this challenge, We made sure that the source is relatively newer, if not, highly relevant.


## III. ANALYSIS

In this section, We present the results of our literature review on DSLs for Workflows. We started by formulating a summary of the answers found in the relevant papers, which is followed by the presentation of the commonalities in the literature.


## A. Key-components of a Domain-Specific Language in Workflow

Since the use of computer systems has increased substantially overtime, there has been an exponential growth in the size of data being collected, which in turn creating a shortage of capable analysts [25]. Hence, visualization has proved to be an effective tool for exploring and gathering insight from large quantities of data [26]. Karl Smeltzer at Oregon State University, designed a prototype for a DSL for data visualization. He described the following key-components for the DSL [27]:

• Abstraction layers: There could be multiple abstraction layers each according to user needs. This would allow the implementation details to be hidden when desired. • Underlying Systematic Model: An underlying model of visualizations rather than flat images. Since the process of data analysis is iterative [28], this would allow users to steer clear of creation of new visualizations at the start of each iteration. Instead, existing visualizations can be transformed as per the new requirements. A team of researchers at the University of Firenze developed a DSL-supported Workflow for the Automated assembly of large stochastic models [29]. In their approach, they used TMDL (Template Models Definition Language). For TMDL, they defined the key-components as follows:

• TMDL "Library": A library is composed of a set of template elements. Each template has a distinguished name, and a set of parameters. • TMDL "Scenario": A scenario is composed of a set of classes. Each class has a distinguished name, and references a specific template in the model library. Moreover, a class may contain a set of assignments, which specify concrete values. For executable system models, formal languages like UML [30] or SysML [31] are increasingly used to model them. Furthermore, an effective way to reduce development and usage effort for complex software systems is the model-driven development (MDD) approach and the model=driven architecture (MDA) [32]. Sven et al., [33] developed a Domain-Specific Language for Executable system models. The defined the key-components as four different model layers which are as follows:

• The meta metamodel layer (M3) • The metamodel layer (M2) • The model layer (M1) • The instance layer (M0) Each layer uses the elements of the upper layer to describe the elements for modeling the lower layer. The important thing to notice in this approach is that the four-layer structure is not fixed for every application. It depends on the specific modeling problem. For example, they used three-layer approach for their system.

A team of researchers at the McGill University, Canada developed a DSL for crisis management systems. The described the following key-component in their approach [34].

• A metamodel: Based on the information from the use cases • A Usecase map: A diagram to show the handling of a given type of emergency from one actor's perspective. Embedded DSL developed for Progressive Spatiotemporal Data Analysis and Visualization has the following keycomponents [35]:

• Abstract Data Type: A new built-in data type that abstracts the common modalities of the scientific data. • Explicit Data Publishing Hints: A hinting mechanism to facilitate incremental production of the results of ongoing computations by clearly indicating the current state as well as the available appropriate opportunities. • Generalized multidimensional Iterators: A generic iterator for loops that can be performed in any order for example for computing an average. They would also permit nonlinear evaluation of the loop body. Arjan et al., 2013 described following as the Ingredients of key-components for any DSL [36]:

• Abstract Syntax or Metamodel: Describes the domain concepts and their relations. • Concrete Syntax or language: Describes the representation of an instance of the metamodel. Usually they are separated to manage the complexity [37], hence separating concept definition from their representation. Regardless of that, the abstract and concrete syntax significantly overlap [38], thus they need to be consistently defined [39]. • Instances of the DSL: Generating a language infrastructure that recognizes the Domain-Specific keywords as defined in the language.

The implementation is based on the Eclipse Platform and its "Modeling" components [40]. The TMDL meta-model has been defined as an Ecore model; Xtext [41] has then been used to define a textual syntax, and to generate the editor, parser, and syntax highlighter. A prototype version of the transformation algorithm has been implemented using the ATLlanguage [3].

Hiroaki et all., 2017 [42] developed a DSL called Con-textWorkflow, a DSL for compensable and Interruptible executions. ContextWorkflow is developed as a DSL embedded in Scala using the Monad interface in scalaz, a functional programming library [43]. The key modules for this specific DSL are as follows:

• Atomic Action and Workflow: An atomic action consists of a normal action (i.e., a Scalaexpression) and a compensation action, and a workflow is a sequence of atomic actions. Both of them are represented as objects of type Workflow, which is basically a compensation monad [44]. • Interruption and Context: Interruptions can only occur between the atomic actions. To tackle this issue, they proposed a two steps scheme:

1) To represent time-varying context 2) To check the context associated to a workflow at the start of the each atomic action Skitter [45], is a DSL for distributed reactive workflows. It is implemented on top of the Elixir programming language. Elixir was chosen for its focus on distributed systems. It has a proven track record of scaling to large systems and is being used by Amazon, Facebook etc. Moreover, it uses an actor model [46] which provides a natural way to treat a component instance as as independant execution unit.

Following are the key-components of Skitter [45]:

• Component Definition: The functions that define how the component reacts to incoming data, as well as the information that how the component can be embedded inside a workflow and the effects it may generate when reacting. • Workflow Definition: It consists of further three entities:


## 1) A set of reactive component instances 2) A source 3) A set of links

• Workflow execution: Write programs using Skitter to solve the problems on hand. In the given case, Skitter uses the dataflow model [47] to achieve parallelism.

B. Common steps in the construction process of a DSL Language for Workflow: There are two common approaches to develop a DSL: Start from the general-purpose UML and constrain and refine it's usage to better embrace Domain-Specifications. Or use a generic language that relates to domain modeling concepts [48].

Following approach was used by the researchers to develop a DSL for a crisis management system [34]: 1) Preliminary Research: To realize the goal of the research and gather relevant information of the system for which the DSL is being developed. 2) Use Cases: To formulate the the concrete requirements aimed to be fulfilled by the DSL. Van et al., describes the following typical steps in the development of a DSL [49]:

• Analysis: 1) Identify the domain of the problem 2) Collect knowledge of the domain 3) Arrange it into small number of concepts 4) Design a DSL that describes the target applications • Implementation:

1) Build a library that implements the Use cases/concepts collected in step 1 2) Design and develop a compiler that executes DSL programs • Use: Write DSL programs for the applications in the target domain Bonachea et al,. [50] presented a practical case study of developing a DSL for costumer user profiling. They advocated a completely iterative model of the process, with iteration taking place between most activities. They reported that the following activities were being implemented: 1) Interview domain experts 2) Models Development 3) Write programs that observes the models 4) Shape the language 5) Use the new DSL to write programs 6) Develop and Implement Runtime system and language compiler Cleaveland [51] proposesd an approach of process modelling for building application generators. They are a particular case of DSL in which a compiler translates high-level specifications into a regular low-level programming language. Their proposed process contains seven steps: 1) Identify/Recognize Domains 2) Define boundaries for domains 3) Define a model underlying it 4) Define the components of variants and in-variants 5) Identify products 6) Develop the generator Khalaoui et al. have examined the success factors for domain specific modeling activities and compiled a list of qualitative criteria with positive and negative impacts [52] which is presented in figure 2.


## C. Limitations of DSLs for Workflows

Tharido et al., 2018 [53] developed a DSL called "Work-flowDSL" for Data Analysis applications. WorkflowDSL language does not have a support for cyclic operations. Moreover, it is ennforced via Xtext validation rules. In addition to that, since this very language was designed to focus on dataintensive workflows, it cannot convey flows of a workflow. Other limitations include, grammar expression capabilities and high dependency on language constructs. Exedra [20], a domain-specific language for large graph analytics workflows has the following limitations.

• The current version of Exedra grammar is limited to graph reading, and graph analysis algorithms such as degree distribution calculation, clustering etc. • This version of Exedra grammar does not have the capability to do graph traversal operations. • There is only implementation of compartments for Scale-Graph and KDT libraries, hence restricting the other mediums. • The communication between different compartments introduces an additional overhead of data format conversion. • Lastly, the Dipper framework is not able to accommodate the changes made to the libraries or the middle ware using which the compartments run. Apart from the development, evaluation of a DSL is also an integral and challenging task. Hence, the question of evaluating DSL solutions is gaining more and more attention in the scientific community [54]. Khalaoui et al. have investigated the success factors for Domain-Specific modeling activities and prepared a list of qualitative criteria with positive and negative impacts [55]. To evaluate a DSM solution, Mohagheghi et al. [56] suggested using both quantitative and qualitative criteria, while taking into account the stakeholder's interests.

To do so, there are following limitations [54]:

• As the complexity of the DSL model increases, simple evaluation metrics do not fulfill the requirements. • To validate the generator classes etc, separate evaluation metrics are required. • The implementation cost and the learning curve for using the DSL is also a challenging factor. Nikolov et al., [57] proposed a DSL for scalable execution of big data workflows with the use of software containers. They put a major focus on workflow definition using a domainspecific language.A workflow step can be defined with a communication medium and triggers. But the metamodel does not have any element to describe the storage system for the workflow. Since the DSL generates a YAML file for cloud orchestration tools, network, ports and build parameters can also be added. Moreover, it is also missing the ability for resource provisioning/management.


## IV. RESULTS

After analysing the relevant literature, the common keycomponents in all the Domain-Specific Languages in Workflow are presented in Table II.   In this paper we covered the major elements involves in any DSL for Workflows, that is, the different layers of a Domain-Specific Language. In addition to that, based on the relevant case studies, what could be the common steps to build those components. There are several stakeholders involved in the development of a DSL. From Software Engineers, Quality Experts, Tool Developers to Domain Experts, End Users. Each stakeholder plays its integral role, either it is implementing the language, requirement gathering, language evolution, scalability or usability/reusability. Concurrency in a Domain-Specific language for Workflows is a challenge, yet to be solved. Furthermore, the complexity is directly proportional to language complexity, that is, the more domain artifacts a DSL covers, the larger its complexity would be.
