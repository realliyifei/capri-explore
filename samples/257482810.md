The time-domain (TD) surveys of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) yield high-cadence radial velocities, paving a new avenue to study binary systems including compact objects. In this work, we explore LAMOST TD spectroscopic data of four K2 plates and present a sample of six single-lined spectroscopic binaries that may contain compact objects. We conduct analyses using phase-resolved radial velocity measurements of the visible star, to characterize each source and to infer the properties of invisible companion. By fitting the radial velocity curves for the six targets, we obtain accurate orbital periods, ranging from ∼ (0.6-6) days, and radial velocity semi-amplitudes, ranging from ∼ (50-130) km s −1 . We calculate the mass function of the unseen companions to be between 0.08 and 0.17 M . Based on the mass function and the estimated stellar parameters of the visible star, we determine the minimum mass of the hidden star. Three targets, J034813, J063350, and J064850, show ellipsoidal variability in the light curves from K2, ZTF, and TESS surveys. Therefore, we can put constraints on the mass of the invisible star using the ellipsoidal variability. We identify no X-ray counterparts for these targets except for J085120, of which the X-ray emission can be ascribed to stellar activity. We note that the nature of these six candidates is worth further characterization utilizing multi-wavelength follow-up observations.

## INTRODUCTION

White dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), and black holes (BHs) are remnants of stars that ended their lifetimes. The identification and characterization of these objects can yield key insights into strong gravitational fields, stellar formation, evolution history, binary interactions and evolution, and the properties and behavior of matter at extreme densities. Additionally, compact objects are closely related to various astronomical phenomena, such as novae, kilonovae, supernovae, Xray bursts, gamma-ray bursts (Troja et al. 2022), and gravitational waves. Many observations show that more than half of stars in the Galaxy are in binary systems (Duchêne & Kraus 2013) and that binary systems con-tain a substantial number of compact objects (Remillard & McClintock 2006;Joss & Rappaport 1984;Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2012).

The number of binaries including WDs has skyrocketed in recent years, thanks to state-of-the-art timedomain surveys Parsons et al. 2016;Ren et al. 2018;El-Badry et al. 2021a;Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2021;Zhang et al. 2022;Zheng et al. 2022a). The identification of the majority of the white dwarf-main-sequence (WD-MS) binaries relies on the distinctive spectral characteristics of WDs. And the majority of binary systems containing NSs or stellarmass BHs are discovered by their bright bursts in the X-ray band (Kreidberg et al. 2012;Casares et al. 2014;Corral-Santana et al. 2016). The X-ray outbursts are caused by mass transfer from the companion overflowing the Roche lobe or stellar wind coming from the companion. Recent gravitational wave detection has confirmed some compact object binaries (Abbott et al. 2016(Abbott et al. , 2017(Abbott et al. , 2020. However, these sources only account for a small population of total compact object binaries. Stellar evolution theory predicts that there are about ∼ 10 8 stellarmass BHs and ∼ 10 9 NSs in our Milky Way (Brown & Bethe 1994). This indicates that there are still plenty of undiscovered quiescent dark objects in our galaxy.

One promising strategy for discovering more dormant compact objects is to search for single-lined spectroscopic binary systems with large mass functions. The methodology, commonly known as the dynamical method, utilizes multi-epoch spectroscopic observations to monitor stars with large radial velocity variations potentially induced by a compact companion. Dynamical searches for non-interacting BHs binaries and NSs binaries (Trimble & Thorne 1969) commenced even before the identification of the first BH in X-ray binaries. Recently, a couple of stellar-mass BHs and NSs in binary systems have been discovered based on the dynamical method (Thompson et al. 2019;Liu et al. 2019Liu et al. , 2020Jayasinghe et al. 2021;El-Badry et al. 2022;Yi et al. 2022;Zheng et al. 2022b;El-Badry et al. 2023). Using time-domain (TD) spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric surveys, the orbital parameters of the systems and the stellar properties of the optically visible stars can be determined, and the presence of hidden companions can be dynamically confirmed.

The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a reflecting Schmidt telescope with a four-meter effective aperture and a wide field of view (Cui et al. 2012). LAMOST provides millions of stellar spectra in both medium-resolution mode (R ∼ 7500) and low-resolution mode (R ∼ 1800). LAM-OST's observation strategy of taking multiple spectra for individual targets provides an ideal opportunity to search for binary systems containing compact objects by dynamical methods. Furthermore, numerous ground-or space-based photometric surveys are now providing vast quantities of photometric data, which include the Kepler K2 mission (Howell et al. 2014), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019), the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ; Ricker et al. 2015). The high-cadence photometry has the potential to be an effective means for searching for compact object candidates (Rowan et al. 2021;Gomel et al. 2021Gomel et al. , 2022. Utilizing the TD spectroscopic data from LAMOST and the wealth of photometric data from ground-or space-based surveys, a dozen of compact object candidates have been revealed Zheng et al. 2019;Yang et al. 2021;Mu et al. 2022;Li et al. 2022;Mazeh et al. 2022;Yuan et al. 2022).

This paper aims to search for compact objects in binary systems based on the LAMOST TD spectroscopic data of four K2 plates (Wang et al. 2021, see their Figure 1). We select a sample containing six single-lined spectroscopic binaries which all have more than 20 radial velocity measurements. We determine the orbital parameters from radial velocity curves and light curves. Then the mass of the optically invisible stars in binaries is estimated by using the mass function. We introduce the details of the data and the criterion for selecting candidates in Section 2. The properties of the sample are shown in Section 3, including the orbital parameters and the stellar parameters. The discussion and the summary are presented in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively.  (Wang et al. 2021, we refer to the survey as four K2 plates). The survey extends the achievements of the LAMOST-Kepler/K2 projects conducted TD and non-TD sky surveys covering the Kepler field and the K2 campaigns from 2012 to 2019 Zong et al. 2020). The four K2 plates have collected ∼767,000 low-resolution and ∼478,000 median-resolution spectra. Wang et al. (2021) used different methods, including the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline (LASP), the DD-Payne, and the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) to determine the stellar parameters, namely, effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and radial velocity. We select 7245 sources from the sample with multiple medresolution observations and a mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 10. In our sub-sample, 5468 sources have more than 10 med-resolution exposures and 4121 sources have more than 20 exposures. All these data are available in the LAMOST DR9 1 .


### Candidates Selection

Compact object candidates can be selected using the mass function:
f (M 2 ) ≡ M 3 2 sin 3 i (M 1 + M 2 ) 2 = K 3 1 P orb 2πG ,(1)
where M 1 is the mass of the optically visible star and M 2 is the mass of the invisible companion, K 1 is the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the visible star, P orb is the orbital period, i is the orbital inclination angle, and G is the gravitational constant. The mass function is a stringent lower mass limit for the unseen companion when i = 90 • and M 1 = 0M . K 1 and P orb can be measured by fitting the radial velocity curve and the light curve. To find promising compact object candidates, we want sources with large mass functions. It is then obvious from Equation (1) that sources with either (or both) large K 1 or P orb are favored. According to previous research on binary systems containing compact objects, such as some stellar-mass BH binaries, a high proportion of the companion stars in these systems exhibit large radial velocity changes (Corral-Santana et al. 2016). And the distribution of their orbital periods ranges from a few hours to tens of days (Steeghs et al. 2013;Corral-Santana et al. 2013).

In the first phase, we pick sources that have ∆V R 80 km s −1 and SNR ≥ 10, where ∆V R is the largest radial velocity variation among all spectroscopic data for a given source. Then we use the Lomb-Scargle algorithm (Lomb 1976;Scargle 1981) to search for periodic signals from the radial velocity measurements. The period corresponding to the highest Lomb-Scargle power is used to phase-fold the radial velocity curve. We visually inspect each radial velocity curve, discard poorly folded curves (e.g., sources with no significant periodic variation), and retain a sample of well-folded curves.

Note that each of our sources has got covered by at least 20, up to 60 repeating spectroscopic observations, ensuring that the radial velocity measurements encompass most of the orbital phases. Therefore, ∆V R /2 is a good approximation of K 1 and is used to estimate the mass function. Based on the ∆V R /2 and the period, we evaluate the mass functions by using Equation (1) and select the sources with f (M 2 ) 0.1M .

After that, we check if the spectrum of each source is single-lined. If a source has a single-lined spectrum but an apparent radial velocity variation, an unseen star that is either a compact object or a much fainter star may exist in this binary system. We employ the method (Merle et al. 2017;Li et al. 2021) based on detecting multiple peaks of the cross correction function (CCF) successive derivatives to determine doublelined (and multi-lined) spectroscopic systems (see Appendix). These non-single-lined spectroscopic binaries are removed from our sample.

Before reaching a final sample of candidates, we crossmatch these sources with the K2 mission (Howell et al. 2014), ZTF (Bellm et al. 2019), ASAS-SN (Shappee et al. 2014), and TESS (Ricker et al. 2015). By using the light curves obtained from these surveys, we can exclude false positives such as close eclipsing binaries which obviously consist of two non-compact stars.

Finally, we gain a sample of six 2 single-lined spectroscopic binary with significant radial velocity variations as candidates who may host compact objects. Their basic information are presented in Table 1.


## RESULTS


### Radial velocity curves and mass functions

We measure the orbital periods from radial velocity measurements using two methods. As mentioned, first, we use the Lomb-Scargle method to search for the periodic signals from the radial velocity measurements. Second, we use TheJoker to fit the radial velocity curve. TheJoker is a python-based package that implements the Monte Carlo sampling technique to fit the two-body problem (Price-Whelan et al. 2017). A uniform period Table 2.

prior spanning [0.1 d, 20 d] is set to for TheJoker. Consistent orbital periods are obtained from these two methods.

Following this, we derive the orbital parameters by fitting the radial velocity curve. We use the general form of a Keplerian orbit, that is:
V r (t) = v 0 + K 1 (cos(f + w) + e cos(w)),
where v 0 is the barycentric velocity (centerof-mass radial velocity), f is the true anomaly, w is the argument of periastron, and e is the eccentricity. The fitted radial velocity curves are shown in Figure 1 and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes are presented in Table 2. Then the mass function of each source is then calculated using Equation 1 and the results are also listed in Table 2. The fitting results reveal that the eccentricity of all sources is approximately equal to zero, indicating that the orbit is circularized.


### Light curves

Meanwhile, we collect the light curves from various photometric TD surveys: K2, TESS , ZTF 3 , and ASAS-SN 4 . Light curves from K2 and TESS are obtained using the python package Lightkurve (Lightkurve Collaboration et al. 2018). We measure the photometric periods (P ph ) using the Lomb-Scargle algorithm. Three selected sources have a P ph consistent with the orbital periods from the radial velocity curve fitting, and the phasedfolded light curves are reliable based on our visual inspections ( Figure 3). Their light curves show typical ellipsoidal modulation (a quasi-sinusoidal variation with double peaks and double valleys feature). The remaining three sources have no discernible periodic variations.


### Mass constraints

We use the broad-band spectral energy distributing (SED) fitting to constrain the stellar parameters of sources by using a python package astroARIADNE 5 . AstroARIADNE is designed as the program that uses the Nested Sampling algorithm to automatically fit the SED of target stars using as many as six distinct atmospheric model grids, to derive effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, distance, radius, and V-band extinction (Vines & Jenkins 2022).

We collect multi-band photometric data including GALEX (Martin et al. 2005;Bianchi et (Wright et al. 2010) to fit the SED. Then we use the parallax from Gaia DR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022) as the prior of distance. We derive the stellar parameters including T eff , logg, [Fe/H], and radius from the SED fitting, which are summarized in Table 2. Several SED fitting results are displayed in Appendix.

We use the stellar evolution models to evaluate the mass of visible companions by utilizing the python package isochrones 6 . We use the SED best-fit parameters and photometry as inputs to derive isochrone interpolated mass with MESA Isochrones & Stellar Tracks isochrones (MIST; Dotter 2016). The isochrone mass is shown in Table 2.

We adopt the isochrone mass as the mass of visible stars to constrain the mass of invisible companions. Combined with the mass function equation, the 


### Filling factor

Three of our chosen candidates exhibit standard ellipsoidal variability, whereas the remaining sources lack periodic photometric variability. After determining their binary orbital parameters and observable star parameters, we calculate the Roche lobe filling factor to characterize each system. The Roche lobe filling factor is defined as f ≡ R 1 /R L1 , where the R L1 is the Roche lobe radius of the visible star. We express the R L1 as the form of (Paczyński 1971
) R L1 a = 0.462 M 1 M 1 + M 2 1/3 ,(2)
where a is the binary separation. The Kepler's third law shows the relation between a and P orb , which take the form as
G(M 1 + M 2 ) a 3 = 4π 2 P 2 orb .(3)
By combining the Equation (2) and the Equation (3) 
we obtain M 1 R 3 L1 = 0.804 P −2 day g cm −3 ,(4)
where P day is the orbital period in the unit of days. We use Equation (4) to estimate R L1 . The filling factor is then estimated by f ≡ R 1 /R L1 , where R 1 is measured from SED fitting. The results are listed in Table 2. The result is consistent in that sources with larger f exhibit significant periodic light curves, such as J034813 and J064850. Sources with small f are still far from filling their Roche lobe radii, therefore, they do not exhibit periodic photometric fluctuations. The filling factor of J066350 is greater than 1, which is a non-physical picture since the Roche lobe radius cannot fall below the physical stellar radius. The photometric variability of J066350 reaches approximately 20% in amplitude, indicating that the optically visible star is close to or even fills up the Roche lobe. We suspect that the system has undergone a mass transfer process, and it may be inappropriate to estimate the stellar parameters by using stellar evolution models. We use log g values sampled by astroARIADNE to find that M grav 1 = 10 logg R 1 2 /G = 2.8 +0.9 −0.7 M . In this case, the corresponding filling factor is around 0.94 to 1.22, suggesting that the mass uncertainty may be the cause of the f > 1 result and the parameters of this object could be physically consistent.  So far, we have only obtained a lower mass limit for the unseen component using the mass function, i.e., assuming that the orbital inclination i = 90 • . In this section, we make further constraints for the candidates showing ellipsoidal light curves.

The three selected candidates, J034813, J063350, and J064850, display typical ellipsoidal variability with a double-peaked profile. The cause of this variability is the tidal interaction between the binary system's objects, which distorts the shape of the stars. The key factors that affect the ellipsoidal variability are the binary inclination angle i, the mass ratio q = M 2 /M 1 , the Roche lobe filling factor f , the limb-darkening coefficient, and the gravity-darkening coefficient. To determine the values of i and q, we utilize the PHOEBE 2.4 (Prša & Zwitter 2005;Prsa et al. 2011;Conroy et al. 2020) software to fit the light curves. The procedures are outlined below.

When fitting the light curves, we keep the orbital period and effective temperature of the optically dominant star fixed at the values listed in Table 2. We set distortion method = none to model the invisible companion as an object without any contributions to flux or eclipses. The limb-darkening coefficients are derived from the PHOEBE atmosphere model with a logarithmic limb-darkening law. The gravitational darkening coefficient is treated as a free parameter and is assigned a prior of β 1 ∼ N (0.32, 0.1) (see Claret & Bloemen 2011;El-Badry et al. 2021b). To perform the MCMC fitting, we use the radius and mass values provided in Table 2 as priors. We run multiple parallel chains using the emcee package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013), with each chain taking 10000 steps. 


### The nature of six candidates

As mentioned in Section 4.2, for J034813, J063350, and J064813, we constrain the orbital inclinations by modeling the ellipsoidal light curves using PHOEBE. The results show that the invisible objects' masses are around 1M . Therefore, we propose that the three binaries contain a massive WD, although the possibility of an NS cannot be ruled out. For J064717, J085102, and J104734, the orbital inclination cannot be constrained due to the absence of periodic light curves; therefore, we calculate the minimum mass of their invisible object with i = 90 • . To constrain the inclination, one possible approach is to resolve the rotational broadening (Marsh et al. 1994) of the tidally locked visible star using highresolution spectra.

We cross-match the candidates with available X-ray surveys: Chandra source catalog (Evans et al. 2010), XMM-Newton source catalog (Traulsen et al. 2020), ROSAT all-sky surveys (Voges et al. 1999) with a matching radius of 10 . We do not find reported Xray observations for most of the sources, except for J085102. An X-ray source 2CXO J085102.0+114901 Normalized flux J064850 Figure 3. Light curves of three sources folded by orbital periods. The photometric data of J034813 is from K2 (The error bars for data points are invisibly small). The photometric data of J063350 is from ZTF. The photometric data of J064850 is from TESS . The red curve represents the best-fitting PHOEBE model.

with an angular distance of 0.62 away was reported by Chandra, which is a high probability X-ray counterpart of J085102. The X-ray flux is F 1.2−2.0 keV = 6.67 +3.53 −3.73 × 10 −16 erg s −1 cm −2 in 1.2-2.0 keV band and F 0.5−7 keV = 2.26 +1.0 −1.0 × 10 −15 erg s −1 cm −2 in 0.5-7.0 keV band. Using the distance of 0.78 kpc from Gaia DR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022), we convert the flux into the luminosity L 1.2−2.0 keV = 4.87 × 10 28 erg s −1 and L 0.5−7 keV = 1.65 × 10 29 erg s −1 , for 1.2-2.0 keV band and 0.5-7.0 keV band, respectively. The X-ray luminosity of J085102 is ∼ 2 − 5 orders of magnitude smaller than low-mass X-ray binaries in the quiescent state (La-sota 2001; Remillard & McClintock 2006;Bernardini & Cackett 2014), which is about 10 31−33 erg s −1 , therefore J085102 is an X-ray faint source. Notably, Wang et al. (2020) calculated the X-ray luminosity of J085102 in the 0.3-8 keV as 2 × 10 29 erg s −1 , and the X-ray-tobolometric luminosity ratio is logR X = −4.84, which was considered that the X-ray emission originates from normal stellar X-ray activity.

In addition to X-ray observations, we cross-match the six candidates with GALEX using a cross-matching radius of 20 . J063350 and J064717 are not observed by GALEX. J034813, J064850, J085102, and J104734  are covered in GALEX's footprints, but neither FUV nor NUV magnitudes are reported. The UV (non-)observations indicate the compact objects are intrinsically UV-faint; that is, they could be a cold WD or an NS. In the case of a WD, we use the GALEX detection limiting magnitude of NUV ∼ 25.5 mag (Morrissey et al. 2007) and the WD cooling model (Bédard et al. 2020) to constrain the WD's NUV flux and obtain an upper limit of the effective temperature. The upper limits for J034813 and J064850 are 8000 K and 9500 K, respectively. We select three binaries possibly containing unseen WDs by using the dynamical method, which is distinct from the spectroscopic decomposition method (Li et al. 2014;Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2016) and the UV-excess selection method . Since WDs in binaries are intrinsically faint relative to the bright MS stars (e.g. F-, G-, and K-type stars), the spectral decomposition method is typically limited to finding WD-M dwarf binaries (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2012;Bar et al. 2017). The UV-excess method can find WD-MS binaries with bright MS companions; however, stellar chromospheric UV emission (Linsky 2017) can severely contaminate the UV-excess candidates. Moreover, the UV-excess method cannot resolve UV-faint sources similar to our candidates J034813 and J064850. In this aspect, the dynamical method is more robust since the orbital parameters and therefore the mass of the unseen compact object can be obtained.


## SUMMARY

Based on the spectroscopic data from the LAMOST TD survey of four K2 plates (Wang et al. 2021), we propose a sample consisting of six single-lined spectroscopic binary systems that may conceal compact objects. Multi-epoch (time-resolved) spectroscopic data provide solid measurements of the stellar radial velocities. We utilize several methods to determine the orbital periods from the radial velocities, fit the radial velocity curve, and calculate the mass function. The six compact object candidates in our sample have f (M 2 ) 0.1M .

We use the SED fitting to estimate the stellar radius and mass. Based on the mass function and the mass of the visible star, we obtain the lower mass limit of the invisible component M min 2 assuming that i = 90 • . The estimated M min 2 exceeds half of the visible stellar mass for all sources. We also obtain light curves from K2, ZTF, and TESS surveys for three targets: J034813, J063350, and J064850, respectively. These light curves show prominent ellipsoidal variability as expected from the tidal distortion of a compact object companion. We use the PHOEBE model to constrain the orbital inclination angle and hence the mass of the unseen companion.

The results indicate that these sources may be binary systems containing a massive white dwarf or neutron star.

In addition, we calculate the visible star's Roche lobe filling factor, showing that most of the systems are not filling up their Roche lobe and therefore could be nonaccreting systems. The sources exhibit no X-ray de-tection except J085120, which is an X-ray faint source. Its X-ray emission can be attributed to stellar activity rather than accretion by the compact companion. We note that the six sources are worth follow-up observations to reveal their true nature.

Thanks to various wide-field TD spectroscopic and photometric surveys, we expect the dynamical method to potentially unearth more hidden compact objects in binary systems. Future observations of other K2 or TESS footprints by LAMOST will aid in expanding the sample of compact objects with a wobbling stellar companion.

## APPENDIX

To verify that the systems are single-lined spectroscopic binaries, we checked whether the CCF profile has a single peak, an indication of a single dominant component. We adopt two spectra for each target source to compute the CCF. These two spectra are chosen to be mostly in anti-orbital phases (near the quadrature phases), such that if there are two components, they would be easily detected in the velocity space. J104734 has poor SNR for most of the spectra, therefore we trade off the phase requirement for better SNR. J063350 and J064850 also have poor medium-resolution spectra, therefore we turn to use the low-resolution spectra. The results the Figure 5 suggest that these sources are most likely single-lined binaries given the current spectroscopic resolution. Figure 6 presents the broadband SED fitting of three targets with ellipsoidal light curve variations. The fitting is performed using the astroARIADNE (Vines & Jenkins 2022) with a single stellar component model. The results suggest that these three targets can be well-fitted with the SED model; No evidence of contamination from other components supports our conclusions about the nature of these systems. .

1Phase-folded radial velocity data (dots) and the best-fitted radial velocity curves (lines) of the selected sources. The error bars for most data points are too small to be seen.lower limit of the invisible object's mass M min 2 is calculated under the assumption that i = 90 • . We find that M min 2 exceeds half of the visible stellar mass for all sources. Since a normal stellar companion of similar mass would contribute non-negligible optical flux and manifest double-lined spectroscopic features, the estimation indicates that each of the systems could conceal a compact object. The result is presented in the right panel ofFigure 2. 4. DISCUSSION

## Figure 2 .
2The minimum mass of the invisible companion M min 2 at the maximum inclination (i = 90 • ). Two dash lines represent the cases M1 = M min 2 and M1 = 2M min 2 .

## Figure 4
4displays the posterior samples for q, i, and R 1 , while the best-fitting PHOEBE model results are illustrated by the red lines in Figure 3. A pure ellipsoidal model adequately fits the observed light curve. Our fitting results suggest i = 55.36 +13.12 −13.73 degree for J034813, with a corresponding invisible object mass of M 2 = 0.98 +0.46 −0.20 M . The model indicates that the inclination of J063350 is nearly edge-on (i = 84.81 +3.73 −5.27 degree), leading to a M 2 = 1.12 +0.10 −0.08 M . For J064850, i = 50.82 +13.52 −10.99 degree and M 2 = 1.08 +0.46 −0.26 M .

When assembling our sample, we found three compact object candidates have been proposed byLi et al. (2022) using the same LAMOST-K2 TD survey, therefore we do not include these three targets in our sample.
