Mindfulness, or present-moment awareness, has been linked to greater psychological well-being and cognitive health in older adults.Recent studies on mindfulness-based intervention further explored its cognitive benefits in adults at the preclinical stage of dementia, yet showing mixed results.Therefore, this meta-analysis synthesizes the effects of mindfulness-based intervention on cognitive function for adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).Literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus.Randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of a mindfulnessbased intervention on cognitive function in adults with MCI were included.Study effects were calculated by standard mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval using random effects model.Meta-regression was conducted to test the effects of methodological quality and intervention characteristics (qualification of interveners, types of mindfulness approach and control treatment) on trial effectiveness.Twelve trials involving 530 participants (female=64.26%,mean age=71.21years) were included.Half of the reviewed studies were pilot trials with a mean attrition rate of 18.7%.Pooled evidence suggested that mindfulness-based intervention exerts a small-to-moderate effect on global cognition (SMD=0.40;95%CI[0.14,0.66]),visuospatial ability (SMD=0.25;95%CI[0.03,0.48])and long-term memory (SMD=0.21;95%CI[0.01,0.41]).No significant effect was detected for short-term memory, executive function, and attention.Meta-regression showed that none of the covariates moderate the treatment effect.This meta-analysis suggested that mindfulness-based intervention might improve cognitive function and its more specific domains in adults with MCI.More research with larger sample is warranted to confirm the effectiveness and examine the underlying mechanism to explain the improved outcomes.

## EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION AND TELEHEALTH PRIMARY CARE: QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY

Ji Yoo 1 , and Jay Shen 2 , 1. Kirk Kerkorian School of Medicine at UNLV,Las Vegas,Nevada,United States,2. School of Public Health,UNLV,Las Vegas,Nevada,United States In a provider shortage area, an Interprofessional Education and Telehealth Primary Care (IPETC) for geriatrics workforce was developed in 2020.To analyze the impact of IPETC on quality and efficiency of care, we measured quality outcomes defined by the CMS defined quality measures -dementia caregiver education/referral and advance care plan, and efficiency outcomes by estimating healthcare cost savings from reducing hospitalization.Two-hundred fortyfour community-dwelling adults aged 60 to 97 with mild to moderate dementia were selected in an urban safety-net primary care clinic.Propensity -demographics and comorbidity was matched.Main outcomes were (A) number of hospitalization and 90-day rehospitalization rate, hospitalizationrelated healthcare cost estimates from the State Inpatient Dataset using the ICD-10 codes of principal diagnosis and hospital length of stay between January-December 2021.One-hundred twenty-two patients were cared by primary care providers who received the IPETC;122 patients were by those who did not have the IPETC; (2) CMS quality measures were compared between 2019 (baseline) and 2021 of patients cared by providers with IPETC.Number of hospitalization with IPETC was fewer than those without IPETC (0.72 vs. 1.38, p < .01).Number of 90-day rehospitalization with IPETC was fewer than those without IPETC (0.14 vs. 0.30, p < .01).An average cost-saving of $20,289 per patient was observed among those with IPETC than those without IPETC (p < .001).CMS quality measures improved from 15.6% to 51.0% in dementia caregiver education/referral; 10.2% to 24.7% in documented advance care plans.

## THE HOSPITAL TO HOME TRANSITION: EFFECTS OF LIFE CHANCES AND LIFE CHOICES ON UNPLANNED HOSPITAL READMISSIONS Dale Yeatts, and Cynthia Cready, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, United States

Roughly 18% of all patients discharged from hospitals in the United States experience an unplanned hospital readmission (UR) within 30 days which can be life-threatening to patients and extremely costly for the health care system.Medicare alone paid $900.8 billion in 2021, or 21 percent of total national hospital expenditures.A promising theory for adding to our understanding of the causes for URs is Health Lifestyle Theory (HLT).It proposes that structural factors (e.g., SES, hospital procedures) affect one's life chances and that socialization and personal experiences affect one's life choices and the two merge to produce a person's health
