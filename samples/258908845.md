Notes: The tracker is an open access database of analysis studies compiled through weekly searches of google scholar ("COVID-19" AND "violence", hits = 3,250), as well as studies found via multiple listservs, newsletters and social media posts. Parameters for inclusion are: 1) Violence against women and/or violence against children studies (excludes studies only analyzing violence against men), 2) studies analyzing psychological/emotional, physical and sexual violence experienced in and outside the home, including attitudes and proxy measures (exclude broader forms of gender-based violence, e.g. child marriage, female genital mutilation, child labor etc.) and self-harm (suicide, self-injury) as well as surveys and data from service provider, 3) No restrictions on study methodology, location or type of publication.

Violence Against Children Survey measures (lifetime before & during lockdown) Notes: Quant = quantitative; Qual = qualitative; Mixed = mixed methodologies (both quantitative and qualitative); NR = not reported; * = may include components related to VAC, however it is unclear due to the phrasing of violence measures; For mode of data collection, if not explicitly mentioned in the publication, it is assumed that data was collected face-to-face; For type of violence, in cases where participants spanned VAC and VAW categories, for simplicity a study was assigned to the majority category (i.e., VAC if the majority of the same was under age 18 and otherwise, VAW); For type of report, all measures other than self-experienced measures are categorized as proxy reports, including measures of perpetration, as violence is experienced by someone else in the household or community.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance Supplemental material placed on this supplemental material which has been supplied by the author(s) Notes: The first column under each category (n) shows the total number of eligible studies for which the checklist item is applicable (the denominator from which the score is calculated), while the second column under each category (%) reflects the percentage meeting (scoring 'Yes') to each checklist item, among those applicable. Items 7, 13 and 14 only apply to certain studies, those that either target minors for interviews, ask minors violence questions directly or ask about VAC. Items 2, 3 and 4 only apply to studies that use interviewers to collect data, and do not apply to webbased data collection.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance  To guarantee respondent's safety, enumerators were trained in each case by an expert on Child

Safeguarding Policy following stringent ethical guidelines on how to ask these questions. Enumerators were instructed to take measures to verify the privacy of the interviews. Same-sex enumerators were used when possible (Gulesci et al. 2021).


## [Items 2, 3, 9]

Two days training were provided for data collectors and supervisors regarding the sensitivity and personal nature of the questions, objective, and how to approach study participants with ensuring their privacy .


## [Items 3, 9]

We recognized that support for participants was vital and thus, prior to each interview we asked each social worker whether he/she would be willing to meet with the women after the interview, if she felt this was needed. This would have been followed up by the first author to ensure that all participants requesting this service, received it, however, no participants requested additional therapy. Psychological support was also arranged for the first author, who conducted the interviews (Dekel &Abrahams 2021) [Item 4, 12]


## Sampling & engaging with respondents

[Items 5-10]

The safety of women participating in the survey was of paramount concern. Given the sensitive nature of the information being collected, a range of safety measures were employed. Safety measures used as part of the survey included:

• Potential respondents were approached by a social research company with an established online panel rather than by the AIC because it would be less likely to raise the suspicion of an abusive partner; • The survey was designed with multiple landing pages and eligibility questions (including a 'safety trap') to screen out ineligible participants (eg men) from accessing the survey; • The content of the survey, and its explicit focus on women, was revealed to respondents only after they had gone through multiple landing pages, stated they met the eligibility criteria and confirmed that they were in a safe place where they were not being observed;

• Women were advised in the information page that, if they felt that answering questions about their relationship experiences would cause them distress or make them unsafe, they should not complete the survey; • Women who closed the survey at any point were not approached again;

• The survey was kept as short as possible and piloted to ensure that women would spend no more than 10 minutes completing all the questions; and • Participants were provided with information about a range of support services, including services that could be contacted online or over the phone. Finally, all of the survey questions were closed-response, meaning that respondents did not have to write any responses. This limited the potential for abusive partners to use keyloggers to access information their partners provided in the survey (Boxall et al. 2020) [Items 5, 9, 11] The women were approached by the female counselors of MSSK over the phone. They had to be telephoned several times before they could be reached. A few limitations that were encountered in virtual communication included fear of a lack of privacy and confidentiality. In many cases, women BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance were reluctant to answer questions about violence that they deemed unimportant in comparison to their immediate concerns regarding food, money, health, and the prevailing situation. Some women refused to answer questions over the phone and wanted to talk through a physical confrontation in MSSK only. However, measures were taken to minimize the risk of this non-response bias by allowing respondents to choose a suitable date and time. Thereafter, the counselor tried several times to contact the women when they could respond without the fear of their conversation being interrupted or eavesdropped. This was essential to guarantee their safety, apart from pre-serving the ethics and protocols of research so that respondents were comfortable enough to respond freely (Mahapatro et al. 2021). [Items 5,9] We had obtained verbal consent from individual study participants before beginning of data collection 


## ) [Item 6]

Verbal informed consent was obtained from participants aged 18 and older; those younger than 18 provided verbal assent with a parent/guardian providing consent (Karp et al. 2021


## ) [Item 7]

Participants were not compensated for their time in this study, although they had been compensated during the main trial at each visit (baseline, midline, endline). Women were warned before commencement of the intimate partner violence module and encouraged to seek privacy; they could decline to answer any module (Hamadani et al. 2021). [Items 8,9] In the case of phone interviews, additional steps were taken to prevent potential perpetrators from listening to participants' answers. In particular, the interviewer provided examples of what types of actions are considered as violent; participants were asked to answer only ''yes'' or ''no'' and given the option of not answering the question if they did not feel comfortable with it. (Gulesci et al. 2021) [Item 9]

Referrals & adverse events  Authors provided text from the questionnaire in a technical appendix: "If you feel upset about anything (now or while completing the survey), the details of someone you can talk to will be made available to you. We have also provided the contact details for services that can support women who are experiencing violence. If you need any kind of help or support, it is available" (Boxall et al.


## 2020). [Item 11]

Respondents were also provided with a list of all the institutions where a violence victim can receive help and protection as well as the procedure to file a complaint (Appendix A.2 shows pictures of the material given to participants). Enumerators received an adverse event protocol explaining what they had to do in cases of abuse (Gulesci et al. 2021). [Items 11,12] The women who were victims of IPV at the time of data collection were reassured and counseled. However, women who experienced severe IPV and were in need of help were taken to Dessie referral hospital counseling care units .


## [Item 12]

As per the government guidelines, follow-up measures were taken by the counselors and they were expected to call each survivor and understand their situation, extend support, and ensure their safety (Mahapatro et al. 2021).


## [Item 12]

If parents or children reported prior experiences of family violence at baseline, the study reported violence exposure to child protective services if not previously reported (Machlin et al. 2021


## ) [Item 14]

Notes: Table is based primarily on the five studies which reported on more than half the items in the ethics reporting checklist (Boxall et al. 2020, 75%;Tadesse et al. 2020, 64%;Gulesci et al. 2021, 55%;Hamadani et al. 2021, 55%;Mahapatro et al. 2021, 55%). In addition, examples are augmented by additional studies providing examples of rarely reported items (Dekel &Abrahams 2021;Karp et al. 2021;Machlin et al. 2021).

Violence Against Children Survey measures (lifetime before & during lockdown) Notes: Quant = quantitative; Qual = qualitative; Mixed = mixed methodologies (both quantitative and qualitative); NR = not reported; * = may include components related to VAC, however it is unclear due to the phrasing of violence measures; For mode of data collection, if not explicitly mentioned in the publication, it is assumed that data was collected face-to-face; For type of violence, in cases where participants spanned VAC and VAW categories, for simplicity a study was assigned to the majority category (i.e., VAC if the majority of the same was under age 18 and otherwise, VAW); For type of report, all measures other than self-experienced measures are categorized as proxy reports, including measures of perpetration, as violence is experienced by someone else in the household or community.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance Supplemental material placed on this supplemental material which has been supplied by the author(s) Notes: The first column under each category (n) shows the total number of eligible studies for which the checklist item is applicable (the denominator from which the score is calculated), while the second column under each category (%) reflects the percentage meeting (scoring 'Yes') to each checklist item, among those applicable. Items 7, 13 and 14 only apply to certain studies, those that either target minors for interviews, ask minors violence questions directly or ask about VAC. Items 2, 3 and 4 only apply to studies that use interviewers to collect data, and do not apply to webbased data collection.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance  To guarantee respondent's safety, enumerators were trained in each case by an expert on Child

Safeguarding Policy following stringent ethical guidelines on how to ask these questions. Enumerators were instructed to take measures to verify the privacy of the interviews. Same-sex enumerators were used when possible (Gulesci et al. 2021).


## [Items 2, 3, 9]

Two days training were provided for data collectors and supervisors regarding the sensitivity and personal nature of the questions, objective, and how to approach study participants with ensuring their privacy .


## [Items 3, 9]

We recognized that support for participants was vital and thus, prior to each interview we asked each social worker whether he/she would be willing to meet with the women after the interview, if she felt this was needed. This would have been followed up by the first author to ensure that all participants requesting this service, received it, however, no participants requested additional therapy. Psychological support was also arranged for the first author, who conducted the interviews (Dekel &Abrahams 2021) [Item 4, 12]


## Sampling & engaging with respondents

[Items 5-10]

The safety of women participating in the survey was of paramount concern. Given the sensitive nature of the information being collected, a range of safety measures were employed. Safety measures used as part of the survey included:

• Potential respondents were approached by a social research company with an established online panel rather than by the AIC because it would be less likely to raise the suspicion of an abusive partner; • The survey was designed with multiple landing pages and eligibility questions (including a 'safety trap') to screen out ineligible participants (eg men) from accessing the survey; • The content of the survey, and its explicit focus on women, was revealed to respondents only after they had gone through multiple landing pages, stated they met the eligibility criteria and confirmed that they were in a safe place where they were not being observed;

• Women were advised in the information page that, if they felt that answering questions about their relationship experiences would cause them distress or make them unsafe, they should not complete the survey; • Women who closed the survey at any point were not approached again;

• The survey was kept as short as possible and piloted to ensure that women would spend no more than 10 minutes completing all the questions; and • Participants were provided with information about a range of support services, including services that could be contacted online or over the phone. Finally, all of the survey questions were closed-response, meaning that respondents did not have to write any responses. This limited the potential for abusive partners to use keyloggers to access information their partners provided in the survey (Boxall et al. 2020) [Items 5, 9, 11] The women were approached by the female counselors of MSSK over the phone. They had to be telephoned several times before they could be reached. A few limitations that were encountered in virtual communication included fear of a lack of privacy and confidentiality. In many cases, women BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance were reluctant to answer questions about violence that they deemed unimportant in comparison to their immediate concerns regarding food, money, health, and the prevailing situation. Some women refused to answer questions over the phone and wanted to talk through a physical confrontation in MSSK only. However, measures were taken to minimize the risk of this non-response bias by allowing respondents to choose a suitable date and time. Thereafter, the counselor tried several times to contact the women when they could respond without the fear of their conversation being interrupted or eavesdropped. This was essential to guarantee their safety, apart from pre-serving the ethics and protocols of research so that respondents were comfortable enough to respond freely (Mahapatro et al. 2021). [Items 5,9] We had obtained verbal consent from individual study participants before beginning of data collection 


## ) [Item 6]

Verbal informed consent was obtained from participants aged 18 and older; those younger than 18 provided verbal assent with a parent/guardian providing consent (Karp et al. 2021


## ) [Item 7]

Participants were not compensated for their time in this study, although they had been compensated during the main trial at each visit (baseline, midline, endline). Women were warned before commencement of the intimate partner violence module and encouraged to seek privacy; they could decline to answer any module (Hamadani et al. 2021). [Items 8,9] In the case of phone interviews, additional steps were taken to prevent potential perpetrators from listening to participants' answers. In particular, the interviewer provided examples of what types of actions are considered as violent; participants were asked to answer only ''yes'' or ''no'' and given the option of not answering the question if they did not feel comfortable with it. (Gulesci et al. 2021) [Item 9]

Referrals & adverse events  Authors provided text from the questionnaire in a technical appendix: "If you feel upset about anything (now or while completing the survey), the details of someone you can talk to will be made available to you. We have also provided the contact details for services that can support women who are experiencing violence. If you need any kind of help or support, it is available" (Boxall et al.


## 2020). [Item 11]

Respondents were also provided with a list of all the institutions where a violence victim can receive help and protection as well as the procedure to file a complaint (Appendix A.2 shows pictures of the material given to participants). Enumerators received an adverse event protocol explaining what they had to do in cases of abuse (Gulesci et al. 2021). [Items 11,12] The women who were victims of IPV at the time of data collection were reassured and counseled. However, women who experienced severe IPV and were in need of help were taken to Dessie referral hospital counseling care units .


## [Item 12]

As per the government guidelines, follow-up measures were taken by the counselors and they were expected to call each survivor and understand their situation, extend support, and ensure their safety (Mahapatro et al. 2021).


## [Item 12]

If parents or children reported prior experiences of family violence at baseline, the study reported violence exposure to child protective services if not previously reported (Machlin et al. 2021


## ) [Item 14]

Notes: Table is based primarily on the five studies which reported on more than half the items in the ethics reporting checklist (Boxall et al. 2020, 75%;Tadesse et al. 2020, 64%;Gulesci et al. 2021, 55%;Hamadani et al. 2021, 55%;Mahapatro et al. 2021, 55%). In addition, examples are augmented by additional studies providing examples of rarely reported items (Dekel &Abrahams 2021;Karp et al. 2021;Machlin et al. 2021).

Violence Against Children Survey measures (lifetime before & during lockdown) Notes: Quant = quantitative; Qual = qualitative; Mixed = mixed methodologies (both quantitative and qualitative); NR = not reported; * = may include components related to VAC, however it is unclear due to the phrasing of violence measures; For mode of data collection, if not explicitly mentioned in the publication, it is assumed that data was collected face-to-face; For type of violence, in cases where participants spanned VAC and VAW categories, for simplicity a study was assigned to the majority category (i.e., VAC if the majority of the same was under age 18 and otherwise, VAW); For type of report, all measures other than self-experienced measures are categorized as proxy reports, including measures of perpetration, as violence is experienced by someone else in the household or community.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance Supplemental material placed on this supplemental material which has been supplied by the author(s) Notes: The first column under each category (n) shows the total number of eligible studies for which the checklist item is applicable (the denominator from which the score is calculated), while the second column under each category (%) reflects the percentage meeting (scoring 'Yes') to each checklist item, among those applicable. Items 7, 13 and 14 only apply to certain studies, those that either target minors for interviews, ask minors violence questions directly or ask about VAC. Items 2, 3 and 4 only apply to studies that use interviewers to collect data, and do not apply to webbased data collection.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance  To guarantee respondent's safety, enumerators were trained in each case by an expert on Child

Safeguarding Policy following stringent ethical guidelines on how to ask these questions. Enumerators were instructed to take measures to verify the privacy of the interviews. Same-sex enumerators were used when possible (Gulesci et al. 2021).


## [Items 2, 3, 9]

Two days training were provided for data collectors and supervisors regarding the sensitivity and personal nature of the questions, objective, and how to approach study participants with ensuring their privacy .


## [Items 3, 9]

We recognized that support for participants was vital and thus, prior to each interview we asked each social worker whether he/she would be willing to meet with the women after the interview, if she felt this was needed. This would have been followed up by the first author to ensure that all participants requesting this service, received it, however, no participants requested additional therapy. Psychological support was also arranged for the first author, who conducted the interviews (Dekel &Abrahams 2021) [Item 4, 12]


## Sampling & engaging with respondents

[Items 5-10]

The safety of women participating in the survey was of paramount concern. Given the sensitive nature of the information being collected, a range of safety measures were employed. Safety measures used as part of the survey included:

• Potential respondents were approached by a social research company with an established online panel rather than by the AIC because it would be less likely to raise the suspicion of an abusive partner; • The survey was designed with multiple landing pages and eligibility questions (including a 'safety trap') to screen out ineligible participants (eg men) from accessing the survey; • The content of the survey, and its explicit focus on women, was revealed to respondents only after they had gone through multiple landing pages, stated they met the eligibility criteria and confirmed that they were in a safe place where they were not being observed;

• Women were advised in the information page that, if they felt that answering questions about their relationship experiences would cause them distress or make them unsafe, they should not complete the survey; • Women who closed the survey at any point were not approached again;

• The survey was kept as short as possible and piloted to ensure that women would spend no more than 10 minutes completing all the questions; and • Participants were provided with information about a range of support services, including services that could be contacted online or over the phone. Finally, all of the survey questions were closed-response, meaning that respondents did not have to write any responses. This limited the potential for abusive partners to use keyloggers to access information their partners provided in the survey (Boxall et al. 2020) [Items 5, 9, 11] The women were approached by the female counselors of MSSK over the phone. They had to be telephoned several times before they could be reached. A few limitations that were encountered in virtual communication included fear of a lack of privacy and confidentiality. In many cases, women BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance were reluctant to answer questions about violence that they deemed unimportant in comparison to their immediate concerns regarding food, money, health, and the prevailing situation. Some women refused to answer questions over the phone and wanted to talk through a physical confrontation in MSSK only. However, measures were taken to minimize the risk of this non-response bias by allowing respondents to choose a suitable date and time. Thereafter, the counselor tried several times to contact the women when they could respond without the fear of their conversation being interrupted or eavesdropped. This was essential to guarantee their safety, apart from pre-serving the ethics and protocols of research so that respondents were comfortable enough to respond freely (Mahapatro et al. 2021). [Items 5,9] We had obtained verbal consent from individual study participants before beginning of data collection 


## ) [Item 6]

Verbal informed consent was obtained from participants aged 18 and older; those younger than 18 provided verbal assent with a parent/guardian providing consent (Karp et al. 2021


## ) [Item 7]

Participants were not compensated for their time in this study, although they had been compensated during the main trial at each visit (baseline, midline, endline). Women were warned before commencement of the intimate partner violence module and encouraged to seek privacy; they could decline to answer any module (Hamadani et al. 2021). [Items 8,9] In the case of phone interviews, additional steps were taken to prevent potential perpetrators from listening to participants' answers. In particular, the interviewer provided examples of what types of actions are considered as violent; participants were asked to answer only ''yes'' or ''no'' and given the option of not answering the question if they did not feel comfortable with it. (Gulesci et al. 2021) [Item 9]

Referrals & adverse events  Authors provided text from the questionnaire in a technical appendix: "If you feel upset about anything (now or while completing the survey), the details of someone you can talk to will be made available to you. We have also provided the contact details for services that can support women who are experiencing violence. If you need any kind of help or support, it is available" (Boxall et al.


## 2020). [Item 11]

Respondents were also provided with a list of all the institutions where a violence victim can receive help and protection as well as the procedure to file a complaint (Appendix A.2 shows pictures of the material given to participants). Enumerators received an adverse event protocol explaining what they had to do in cases of abuse (Gulesci et al. 2021). [Items 11,12] The women who were victims of IPV at the time of data collection were reassured and counseled. However, women who experienced severe IPV and were in need of help were taken to Dessie referral hospital counseling care units .


## [Item 12]

As per the government guidelines, follow-up measures were taken by the counselors and they were expected to call each survivor and understand their situation, extend support, and ensure their safety (Mahapatro et al. 2021).


## [Item 12]

If parents or children reported prior experiences of family violence at baseline, the study reported violence exposure to child protective services if not previously reported (Machlin et al. 2021


## ) [Item 14]

Notes: Table is based primarily on the five studies which reported on more than half the items in the ethics reporting checklist (Boxall et al. 2020, 75%;Tadesse et al. 2020, 64%;Gulesci et al. 2021, 55%;Hamadani et al. 2021, 55%;Mahapatro et al. 2021, 55%). In addition, examples are augmented by additional studies providing examples of rarely reported items (Dekel &Abrahams 2021;Karp et al. 2021;Machlin et al. 2021).

Violence Against Children Survey measures (lifetime before & during lockdown) Notes: Quant = quantitative; Qual = qualitative; Mixed = mixed methodologies (both quantitative and qualitative); NR = not reported; * = may include components related to VAC, however it is unclear due to the phrasing of violence measures; For mode of data collection, if not explicitly mentioned in the publication, it is assumed that data was collected face-to-face; For type of violence, in cases where participants spanned VAC and VAW categories, for simplicity a study was assigned to the majority category (i.e., VAC if the majority of the same was under age 18 and otherwise, VAW); For type of report, all measures other than self-experienced measures are categorized as proxy reports, including measures of perpetration, as violence is experienced by someone else in the household or community.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance Supplemental material placed on this supplemental material which has been supplied by the author(s) Notes: The first column under each category (n) shows the total number of eligible studies for which the checklist item is applicable (the denominator from which the score is calculated), while the second column under each category (%) reflects the percentage meeting (scoring 'Yes') to each checklist item, among those applicable. Items 7, 13 and 14 only apply to certain studies, those that either target minors for interviews, ask minors violence questions directly or ask about VAC. Items 2, 3 and 4 only apply to studies that use interviewers to collect data, and do not apply to webbased data collection.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance  To guarantee respondent's safety, enumerators were trained in each case by an expert on Child

Safeguarding Policy following stringent ethical guidelines on how to ask these questions. Enumerators were instructed to take measures to verify the privacy of the interviews. Same-sex enumerators were used when possible (Gulesci et al. 2021).


## [Items 2, 3, 9]

Two days training were provided for data collectors and supervisors regarding the sensitivity and personal nature of the questions, objective, and how to approach study participants with ensuring their privacy .


## [Items 3, 9]

We recognized that support for participants was vital and thus, prior to each interview we asked each social worker whether he/she would be willing to meet with the women after the interview, if she felt this was needed. This would have been followed up by the first author to ensure that all participants requesting this service, received it, however, no participants requested additional therapy. Psychological support was also arranged for the first author, who conducted the interviews (Dekel &Abrahams 2021) [Item 4, 12]


## Sampling & engaging with respondents

[Items 5-10]

The safety of women participating in the survey was of paramount concern. Given the sensitive nature of the information being collected, a range of safety measures were employed. Safety measures used as part of the survey included:

• Potential respondents were approached by a social research company with an established online panel rather than by the AIC because it would be less likely to raise the suspicion of an abusive partner; • The survey was designed with multiple landing pages and eligibility questions (including a 'safety trap') to screen out ineligible participants (eg men) from accessing the survey; • The content of the survey, and its explicit focus on women, was revealed to respondents only after they had gone through multiple landing pages, stated they met the eligibility criteria and confirmed that they were in a safe place where they were not being observed;

• Women were advised in the information page that, if they felt that answering questions about their relationship experiences would cause them distress or make them unsafe, they should not complete the survey; • Women who closed the survey at any point were not approached again;

• The survey was kept as short as possible and piloted to ensure that women would spend no more than 10 minutes completing all the questions; and • Participants were provided with information about a range of support services, including services that could be contacted online or over the phone. Finally, all of the survey questions were closed-response, meaning that respondents did not have to write any responses. This limited the potential for abusive partners to use keyloggers to access information their partners provided in the survey (Boxall et al. 2020) [Items 5, 9, 11] The women were approached by the female counselors of MSSK over the phone. They had to be telephoned several times before they could be reached. A few limitations that were encountered in virtual communication included fear of a lack of privacy and confidentiality. In many cases, women BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance were reluctant to answer questions about violence that they deemed unimportant in comparison to their immediate concerns regarding food, money, health, and the prevailing situation. Some women refused to answer questions over the phone and wanted to talk through a physical confrontation in MSSK only. However, measures were taken to minimize the risk of this non-response bias by allowing respondents to choose a suitable date and time. Thereafter, the counselor tried several times to contact the women when they could respond without the fear of their conversation being interrupted or eavesdropped. This was essential to guarantee their safety, apart from pre-serving the ethics and protocols of research so that respondents were comfortable enough to respond freely (Mahapatro et al. 2021). [Items 5,9] We had obtained verbal consent from individual study participants before beginning of data collection 


## ) [Item 6]

Verbal informed consent was obtained from participants aged 18 and older; those younger than 18 provided verbal assent with a parent/guardian providing consent (Karp et al. 2021


## ) [Item 7]

Participants were not compensated for their time in this study, although they had been compensated during the main trial at each visit (baseline, midline, endline). Women were warned before commencement of the intimate partner violence module and encouraged to seek privacy; they could decline to answer any module (Hamadani et al. 2021). [Items 8,9] In the case of phone interviews, additional steps were taken to prevent potential perpetrators from listening to participants' answers. In particular, the interviewer provided examples of what types of actions are considered as violent; participants were asked to answer only ''yes'' or ''no'' and given the option of not answering the question if they did not feel comfortable with it. (Gulesci et al. 2021) [Item 9]

Referrals & adverse events  Authors provided text from the questionnaire in a technical appendix: "If you feel upset about anything (now or while completing the survey), the details of someone you can talk to will be made available to you. We have also provided the contact details for services that can support women who are experiencing violence. If you need any kind of help or support, it is available" (Boxall et al.


## 2020). [Item 11]

Respondents were also provided with a list of all the institutions where a violence victim can receive help and protection as well as the procedure to file a complaint (Appendix A.2 shows pictures of the material given to participants). Enumerators received an adverse event protocol explaining what they had to do in cases of abuse (Gulesci et al. 2021). [Items 11,12] The women who were victims of IPV at the time of data collection were reassured and counseled. However, women who experienced severe IPV and were in need of help were taken to Dessie referral hospital counseling care units .


## [Item 12]

As per the government guidelines, follow-up measures were taken by the counselors and they were expected to call each survivor and understand their situation, extend support, and ensure their safety (Mahapatro et al. 2021).


## [Item 12]

If parents or children reported prior experiences of family violence at baseline, the study reported violence exposure to child protective services if not previously reported (Machlin et al. 2021


## ) [Item 14]

Notes: Table is based primarily on the five studies which reported on more than half the items in the ethics reporting checklist (Boxall et al. 2020, 75%;Tadesse et al. 2020, 64%;Gulesci et al. 2021, 55%;Hamadani et al. 2021, 55%;Mahapatro et al. 2021, 55%). In addition, examples are augmented by additional studies providing examples of rarely reported items (Dekel &Abrahams 2021;Karp et al. 2021;Machlin et al. 2021).
