The seed of red Abrus precatorius varieties was washed with tap water, dried, and powdered. The plant extract was prepared according to the method prescribed by Pandya (2010) with some modifications. These powdered materials (15 g) were then used for extraction with methanol in the Soxhlet apparatus at 60 ºC to 70 ºC for about 9 hours. In the end, the solvent was collected in a Petri dish and allowed to evaporate to dryness. The remaining residues are further extracted similarly at 9 h. After the completion of extraction, the extract was concentrated and allowed to evaporate at room temperature for overnight to get colored viscous gummy residues. These residues were then used for subsequent experiments. These residues were then transferred to microfuge tubes and samples were reconstituted in methanol. These dissolved residues were then used for further GC-MS analysis. Particularly for the total phenol and flavonoids study, the dried extracts were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (20 mg/ ml) and diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to give final concentrations. Total phenolics were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent as described by Yang et al (2007) with minor modifications. A range of different concentrations of Gallic acid was used for the preparation of the standard curve (r2 = 0.9674). Final results were given as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/ g dw. Total flavonoids have been measured the method given by Barreira et al (2008) with some modifications. A standard curve was prepared with known concentrations of quercetin (r2 = 0.945). Results were given as quercetin equivalents (mg QE)/g of dw. Identification of phytoconstituents from methanolic extracts of seed of red Abrus precatorius was carried out by Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis using the method of Chunha et al (2012) with some modifications. This extract was analyzed on a Shimadzu GC2010 system comprising an AOC-20i autoinjector and interfaced to a mass spectrometer QP Plus 2010. Sample (1µl) was injected and separation of compounds was executed by DB17 MS (50 % -Phenyl -50 % Mehtyl Polysiloxane) mid-polarity fused capillary column (30 mt x 0.25 µm ID, 0.25 µm film thickness); while helium (purity 99.99%) gas was used as carrier gas.

The fresh seeds were separated from matured, fruits, shade dried, broken into small pieces, and powdered coarsely. About 600 gm of air-dried powdered material was extracted with 99.9% of ethanol in a Soxhlet extractor for 7 days. The extract was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure and controlled temperature (40-50ºC) using a rotary evaporator. The ethanolic extract yielded a brown sticky mass weighing 9.2g (10.3% w/w) and the extractive value was found to be 3.326% w/w. the extract was used directly for total phenol and flavonoid content determination.

The phytochemical evaluation of the ethanol extract of the Abrus precatorius seeds shows the presence of Carbohydrates, Alkaloids, Steroids, Sterols, Flavanoids, Tannins, Phenolic compounds, proteins and amino acids, fixed oil, and the absence of glycoside, saponin, and anthraquinone. The total phenolic content of ASEt was estimated according to the method of Makkar et.al (1997). The aliquots of the extract were taken in a test tube and made up to the volume of 1 ml with distilled water. Then 0.5 ml of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (1:1 with water) and 2.5 ml of sodium carbonate solution (20%) were added sequentially to the test tube. Soon after overtaxing the reaction mixture, the tubes were placed in the dark for 40 min. and the optical density was documented at 725 nanometres against the reagent blank. Utilizing gallic acid a linearity curve was produced. The linearity produced was on the scale of 1-10 microgram/milliliter. using the standard curve, the total phenolic content was calculated and expressed as gallic acid equivalent in mg/g of extract.

A total phenolic compound in ethanolic seeds extract of Abrus precatorius was found to be 95 mg/g of extract calculated as gallic acid equivalent. (r2=0.9976). The total flavonoid compound in ethanolic seeds extract of Abrus precatorius was found to be 21 mg/g of extract calculated as rutin equivalent. (r2=0.9985). Flavones and flavonols that exist in the ethanolic extracts of Abrus seeds were determined as rutin equivalents. Rutin was utilized to make the calibration curve [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90, and 100 in 99.9% ethanol (v/v)]. The standard solutions or extracts (0.5 ml) were mixed with 1.5 ml of 95% ethanol (v/v), 0.1 ml of 10% Aluminium chloride 42(w/v), 0.1 ml of 1 mol/l sodium acetate, and 2.8 ml of water.

Seeds of Abrus precatorius (Linn.) were washed with tap water and air-dried at room temperature and then in the oven at 50°C until complete dryness. Seed samples were ground in an electric blender to a fine powder. About 90 g of the plant powder was extracted 3 times successively with 180 ml methyl alcohol (95%) in Ultrasonic apparatus for 40 min each. Extracts were combined and dried over sodium sulfate (anhydrous) and the solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator (Unipan vacuum rotary evaporator type 350P, Poland). Then, the residue was re-dissolved in 95% methyl alcohol and used for the bioassay and identification assays. Phytochemical analysis shows the presence of sterols or triterpenes, flavonoids, alkaloids, resins, phenols, and glycoside compounds and shows the absence of tannins and saponins. The seeds of Abrus precatorius were extracted with methanol. The solvent was completely removed by a rotary vacuum evaporator. Then, the methanolic extractives were applied onto a top-of-column chromatography loaded with silica gel (60 ~ 120 mesh) and eluted using solvent systems containing a gradient of ethyl acetate: absolute ethyl alcohol (5,20,40,80, and 95%). The 20% fraction of ethyl acetate: absolute alcohol was more active against the bacteria than the other fractions. This fraction was further purified on silica gel and its 12 separated fractions were collected. Among these fractions, the 5th to the 8th fractions have the same compound and were eluted onto a preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) with a mobile phase of ethyl acetate and absolute ethyl alcohol to collect the pure compound, di-(2ethylhexyl) phthalate. The purity of the isolated compound was checked on TLC plates and confirmed by GC-MS and tested against the selected bacteria. The GC-MS analysis was accomplished using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatography system equipped with an Agilent mass spectrometric detector, with a direct capillary interface and fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 μm film thicknesses). Samples were injected under the following conditions: helium was used as carrier gas at approximately 1 ml/min pulsed split less mode. The solvent delay was 3 min and the injection volume was 1.0 μl. The mass spectrophotometric detector was operated in an electron impact ionization mode, with ion energy of 70 e.v., the scan was from 50 -500 m/z, and the ion source temperature was 230º C. The electron multiplier voltage (EM voltage) was maintained at 1050 v above the autotune. The instrument was none automatically adjusted utilizing perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA). The GC temperature plan was 60º C for 3 min and then elevated to 280º and 250º C, respectively.

The result shows the presence of various active biological compounds of which major components were Benzoic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-, methyl ester [1.796 (µg/ml)] 1,2,4,5-Cyclohexanetetrol, (1.alpha., 2.alpha., 4.alpha., 5.beta.)-[1.397 (µg/ml)] 5-Pyrimidinol, 2-methyl-[1.317 (µg/ml)], Decahydro-isoquinoline-3carbonitrile [1.273 (mcg/ml)], Oleic Acid [0.989 (mcg/ml)], 17-Octadecenoic acid, methyl ester [0.573 (µg/ml)], 4-Hydroxy-3-methyl acetophenone [0.504 (µg/ml)], etc. The phytochemical evaluation of the ethanol extract of the Abrus precatorius seeds shows the presence of Carbohydrates, Alkaloids, Steroids, Sterols, Flavanoids, Tannins, Phenolic compounds, proteins and amino acids, fixed oil, and the absence of glycoside, saponin, and anthraquinone. A total phenolic compound in ethanolic seeds extract of Abrus precatorius was found to be 95 mg/g of extract calculated as Gallic acid equivalent. (r2=0.9976). The total flavonoid compound in ethanolic seeds extract of Abrus precatorius was found to be 21 mg/g of extract calculated as rutin equivalent. (r2=0.9985). Phytochemical analysis of 95% methanol extract of the Abrus seeds shows the presence of sterols or triterpenes, flavonoids, alkaloids, resins, phenols, and glycosides compounds and shows the absence of tannins and saponin. The main compound of A. precatorius extract was confirmed and identified by GC-MS analysis as di-(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) from seeds of A. precatorius. The phytochemical analysis of abrus seeds extract with 75% ethanol and water shows the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, saponins, tannins, phytosterols, flavonoids, and triterpene. The phytochemical active compounds of seed coat extract were qualitatively analyzed and the data indicate that the aqueous extract of seed coat showed the presence of phytochemical active compounds such as alkaloids, saponins, cardiac glycosides flavonoids, tannins, and phenols. The aqueous extract of A. precatorius was found to contain a noticeable amount of total flavonoids i.e., 6mg/g which plays a major role in controlling antioxidants and total phenolic content of 2mg/g.


## CONCLUSION

This review article disclosed the phytochemical evaluation of the Abrus precatorius seeds by using various solvents and the total polyphenol content and the flavonoid content of Abrus seeds and the determination of the various constituents present in the Abrus precatorius seeds by the HPTLC & GC-MS.

−1 was prepared by adding 900 µl HPLC grade methanol into 100 µl of stock solution. Chromatography was performed on Merck HPTLC precoated silica gel 60 GF254 (20 × 10 cm) plates. Methanolic solutions of samples and standard compounds (Gallic acid & Glycyrrhizin,) of known concentrations were applied to layers as 6 mm wide bands positioned 15 mm from the bottom and 10 mm from the side of the plate, using Camag Linomat 5 automated TLC applicator with nitrogen flow providing a delivery speed of 150 nl/s from application syringe. These conditions were kept constant throughout the analysis of samples. Detection and Quantification of standards − Following sample application, layers were developed in a Camag glass twin trough chamber (20 cm × 10 cm) that had been saturated with a mobile phase of Toluene: Ethyl acetate: Formic acid (50: 40: 10v/v) for Gallic acid and Chloroform: Glacial acetic acid: Methanol: Water (60: 32: 12: 8) for Glycyrrhizin till proper separation of bands up to 80 mm height from point of application. After development, layers were dried with a dryer and Gallic acid & Glycyrrhizin were quantified by using Camag TLC scanner model 3 equipped with Camag win CATS (version 3.2.1) software. Following scan conditions were applied: slit width, 4 millimetres × 0.45 millimetres; wavelength 254 nanometres for Gallic acid & glycyrrhizin and absorption-reflection scan way.
