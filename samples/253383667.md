We develop an experimentally validated, short and easy-to-use survey module for measuring individual debt aversion. To this end, we first estimate debt aversion on an individual level, using choice data fromMeissner and Albrecht (2022). This data also contains responses to a large set of debt aversion survey items, consisting of existing items from the literature and novel items developed for this study. Out of these, we identify a survey module comprising two qualitative survey items to best predict debt aversion in the incentivized experiment.

# Introduction

In this paper, we develop an experimentally validated, short and easy-to-use survey module for measuring individual debt aversion. Debt aversion has been shown to affect financial decision-making in a variety of different contexts, such as financing (tertiary) education (Field, 2009;Caetano et al., 2019), private investments in real estate (Schleich et al., 2021) or entrepreneurial activity (Nguyen et al., 2020). In Meissner and Albrecht (2022) we show that debt aversion has a strong impact on borrowing and saving decisions and that it captures a genuine preference that is distinct from other individual preferences for time, risk and losses. However, while debt aversion appears to have a strong influence on financial decision-making, it is notoriously difficult to measure, typically involving complex and resource-intensive experiments (see e.g. Meissner, 2016;Ahrens et al., 2022;Meissner and Albrecht, 2022). This complicates the study of debt aversion on a larger scale and impedes the understanding of debt aversion and its effects in representative populations.

In this paper, we develop an experimentally validated, short and easy-to-use survey module for measuring individual debt aversion. Using the choice data and theoretical framework of Meissner and Albrecht (2022), we structurally estimate parameters of debt aversion on the individual level, using hierarchical maximum likelihood methods. Building on the methodology of the Global Preference Survey -GPS (Falk et al., 2018(Falk et al., , 2022 we then test the predictive power of a large set of debt aversion survey items, consisting of existing items from the literature and novel items developed for this study. Out of these, we select a smaller subset of survey items, that jointly best predict debt aversion in the incentivized experiment as our debt aversion survey module.

The module that provides the best trade-off between in-and out-of-sample fit, as well as brevity of implementation, consists of two Likert scale survey items, summarized in Table 1. This survey module is short, easy to implement and predicts debt aversion reasonably well. It may therefore facilitate future work on debt aversion, in research where expensive and complex incentivized experiments are not feasible, such as largescale representative surveys. Further, the survey module might also improve behavioral predictions and identification in research where debt aversion is not the main focus. In such contexts, it enables to easily control for individual preferences towards debt and thus may prevent inference on spurious relationships.

In the following, we first introduce the debt aversion survey module in Section 2 and delineate its practical implementation in detail. Next, we summarize the design and procedures of the validation study in Section 3 which provides experimentally measured individual preferences on risk, time and losses as well as debt aversion as the base of the survey module development. Section 4 outlines the details of identifying the debt aversion survey module. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss the strengths and limitations of the identified survey module.


# Debt Aversion Survey Module

Balancing predictive accuracy and brevity of implementation, we propose the debt aversion survey module in Table 1. It consists of two qualitative survey items: Q1 and Q2. Table 1 provides the exact wording of questions and the corresponding response categories, which can be directly implemented in any questionnaire as part of an experiment or a survey. 1 As in Meissner and Albrecht (2022), we denote γ as the parameter of debt aversion. γ = 1 implies debt neutrality, γ > 1 implies debt aversion and γ < 1 implies debt affinity. 2

To translate responses to the survey module into a quantitative measure of debt aversion, the coefficients in the last column of Table 1 can be used as weights to construct γ, as the weighted sum of the module's items and the constant. These weights represent estimated OLS coefficients stemming from the multivariate regression of the debt aversion parameter γ, the dependent variable, on the survey module's set of predictors as independent variables. Likert Scale ratings are coded in the range of 1 to 6 corresponding to answers from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree". We include a hypothetical example in Appendix A.

The survey module's quality can be quantified by several metrics. With respect to within-sample fit, the survey module and the parameter of debt aversion elicited through the incentivized experiment reach a correlation of 0.3073. 3 This value is close to the lower 1 Note that item Q2 asks about second-order beliefs and is thus introduced differently than Q1.

3 Preferences over risk, time and losses are not significantly correlated with debt aversion as measured by the survey module. 


# Validation Study

To construct the debt aversion survey module we make use of the theoretical framework and experimental data from Meissner and Albrecht (2022). Both taken together enable the quantification of debt aversion on the individual level. A summary of the theory of debt aversion can be found in Appendix B. For a more detailed description of the theory and corresponding experiment, we refer the reader to the original paper. We use the experimental choice data to structurally estimate the parameter of debt aversion γ on the individual level. Using the individual estimates of γ, we can construct a debt aversion 4 The MAE is calculated based on 100 repeated random samples with k=5 and k=10 partitions of the data, respectively. The reported figure is the average mean absolute error over the two levels of k.

survey module that optimally predicts γ and thus the degree of debt aversion. The following paragraphs provide a summary of the experiment and detail the procedures to structurally estimate preference parameters on the individual level. To construct the debt aversion survey module, we extend the estimation procedure of Meissner and Albrecht (2022) to additionally estimate preference parameters on the individual level. In Meissner and Albrecht (2022) we use the entirety of all 90 choices made by all participants to jointly estimate preference parameters of risk, loss and debt aversion as well as time discounting, using maximum likelihood procedures. We estimate preferences on the aggregate level, i.e. for the average decision-maker. Additionally, we estimate moments of the population distributions of preference parameters. Extending these procedures for this study, we employ hierarchical maximum likelihood estimation to retrieve individual preference parameters, loosely following Murphy and ten Brincke (2018) and Farrell and Ludwig (2008). This technique has been established to increase the reliability of individual preference parameter estimates which have to rely on far less data than aggregate estimations. Hierarchical maximum likelihood procedures estimate the set of individual preference parameters that is most likely to produce the observed choices of the respective person, weighted by the probability of occurrence of such parameter estimates given the population distribution of parameter estimates.


## Preference Elicitation and Estimation

Based on the random utility model outlined in Meissner and Albrecht (2022), a decision maker with preference parameters ω = (α, β, γ, λ) chooses option B if U(X B , ω) + ε B ≥ U(X A , ω) + ε A . The probability of observing choice B can then be written as:
P B (θ) = F U(X B , ω) − U(X A , ω) µ = F (∆U(θ)),(1)
where F is the cumulative distribution function of (ε A − ε B ). We assume (ε A − ε B ) to follow a standard logistic distribution with distribution function F (ξ) = (1 + e −ξ ) −1 , corresponding to the often termed Luce model (Luce et al., 1965;Holt and Laury, 2002) or Fechner error with logit link (Drichoutis and Lusk, 2014). F (∆U(θ)) depends on the preference parameters for risk aversion, time discounting, debt aversion and loss aversion:

α, δ, γ and λ, respectively and the error parameter µ. All five parameters, summarized by the vector θ = (α, β, γ, λ, µ), are identified on the individual level through hierarchical maximum likelihood estimation based on observed choices and the population distribution of preference parameters. 5 The population distributions have already been retrieved in the first hierarchy level of estimation in Meissner and Albrecht (2022). Thus, we here consider them as given by the normal density functions d(α), d(δ), d(γ) and d(λ). We denote the product of these normal densities as
d(ω) = d(α)d(δ)d(γ)d(λ).
The hierarchical likelihood function on the individual level then writes as
ln (L(θ)) = j [ln (F (∆U(θ))w(d(ω))) c j + ln (1 − F (∆U(θ))w(d(ω))) (1 − c j )] ,(2)
where c j = 0 if Option A was chosen in choice j, c j = 1 if Option B was chosen in choice j. Further, w(d(ω)) denotes the product of preference parameters' density functions, given their distribution in the population, weighted by function w(·).

We introduce w to prevent a potential pitfall of hierarchical estimation. Scheibehenne and Pachur (2015) argue that the relative influence of population distributions on individual preference parameters, as opposed to the influence of individual choices, may be too large. In other words, hierarchical estimation may produce excessive shrinkage of individual parameter estimates toward their population mean. 6 Following a suggestion by Murphy and ten Brincke (2018) we mitigate this effect by weighing d(ω). In particular, we introduce the weighting  We estimate the optimal shrinkage factor s based on simulated, hypothetical individuals with known preference parameters. To this end, we apply the outlined hierarchical ML procedure to estimate preference parameters from simulated choices. By comparing the estimated parameters to true, assumed parameters we can quantify the goodness-of-fit.
function w(d(ω)) = d(ω) s ,(3)
Using grid-search, we find s = 0.0139 to minimize mean squared error (MSE) of estimated and true individual parameters of debt aversion γ.

By maximizing the hierarchical log-likelihood function (Equation 2) based on choice data and population distributions from Meissner and Albrecht (2022) we derive point estimates for all preference parameters and the error parameter per individual. 8 In this way, we retrieve individual preference parameters, including γ, the coefficient of debt aversion, for 96 participants. Figure 1 summarizes the distribution of γ. Individual 7 We employ the exponential form, as it preserves the range of d(ω), i.e. both d(ω) and w(d(ω)) lie in the range of probabilities [0, 1]. Further, the exponential form introduces only one additional parameter to be estimated. 8 To increase the reliability of estimates we ensure that the same estimates can be retrieved using STATA's modified Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm and through maximization using the Nelder-Mead algorithm implemented in R. Individuals, whose parameters cannot be estimated consistently, i.e. estimates from R are more than 10% higher or lower than estimates from STATA, are discarded. For consistent estimates, we choose results from either STATA or R depending on which routine yielded a higher likelihood score for the given individual's parameter estimates. parameter estimates range from γ = 0.9468, corresponding to debt affinity, to γ = 1.1171, corresponding to debt aversion. Around, 96% of individuals are estimated as debt averse with a parameter γ > 1, the median level of debt aversion is γ = 1.0523.


## Included survey items

Besides incentivized choices, we collected a battery of self-reported, qualitative measures of debt behavior and attitudes in Meissner and Albrecht (2022). For this purpose, we composed a comprehensive set of 54 survey items, roughly spanning the clusters experience and usage of borrowing, appropriateness to be indebted, rules, norms and personal preferences on debt. The items are collected from previous studies using questionnairebased measures of debt attitudes but also include novel items developed for this study.

Items range from directly asking respondents to state "how much they (dis)like being in debt in general" to more indirect survey items around the topic of debt and money.

The complete list of items can be found in Appendix, Table D.1. In addition to the set of survey items, we implemented a hypothetical, multiple price list consisting of 15 debt contracts. To minimize the required response time, the hypothetical debt contracts were presented using the staircase method (Cornsweet, 1962). This mode of presentation allows to identify the switchpoint between accepting and not accepting each of the 15 contracts by only asking four successive questions. for detailed instructions see Appendix D.2. We count the switchpoint in the hypothetical choice task as one additional quantitative survey item.


# Identification of the Debt Aversion Survey Module

To identify an experimentally validated survey module for debt aversion we follow the procedures established for the GPS (Falk et al., 2022). To construct the survey module, we first consider the entirety of collected survey items, and all possible combinations thereof. We then identify the subset of items that yields the best combination of predictive accuracy for individual debt aversion and brevity. We begin by considering a baseline pool of 55 potential best predictors including qualitative items collected from existing literature on debt attitudes, novel items developed for this study and the switchpoint in the hypothetical debt contract choice task. By stepwise reduction, we condense the amount of predictors to a debt aversion survey module of two items.

In the first step, we discard thirteen items that appear improper to construct an easy and widely applicable survey module. Six items have a specific focus on (debt) financing tertiary education, which makes them inappropriate for use beyond the university context.

For further five items, we could not identify an intuitive directional hypothesis on the relation of the item and debt aversion. Lastly, two items exhibit a correlation with debt aversion, which goes against the direction of an intuitive hypothesis. A potential reason for this could be a misunderstanding of these items due to double negative wording.

As a second step, we consider a multitude of linear regressions, modelling the exper- 
γ i = β 0 + β 1 x 1i + ... + β p x pi + ε i(4)
The number of potential combinations, increases rapidly in the number of considered items, and quickly becomes intractable with conventional computational resources. 9

We therefore create a shortlist of predictor variables that appear in any of the ten best performing models, evaluated according to adjusted R 2 for models with one, two, three up to six predictors, respectively. 10 This shortlist contains 16 items. Using the shortlist we run linear OLS regressions on all possible combinations of predictors, i.e. 524 288 regressions. In line with the GPS module (Falk et al., 2022), we use adjusted R 2 , a criterion of in-sample-fit, to identify the best subset for each number of predictors.

Third, to discriminate between models comprising different numbers of variables we additionally consider information criteria and estimates of out-of-sample predictive power based on cross-validation. We consider the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as introduced by Akaike (1974) and the Bayesian or Bayes-Schwarz Information Criterion (BIC) as introduced by Schwarz (1978). With respect to cross-validation, we implement k-fold cross-validations (Stone, 1974) splitting our sample into k = 5 and k = 10 data chunks with 100 random samples each to calculate mean squared prediction errors (MSE) for the parameter of debt aversion γ of the candidate models. The performance of the five best candidate models per number of predictors are summarized in Figure 2.

Bringing together the variety of performance measures calculated in the previous step, we identify a survey module containing two items as providing a good trade-off between brevity and predictive power. Figure 2 shows that adjusted R 2 is maximized for a model with nine predictors, while AIC favors a six and BIC a one predictor model. The discrepancy in terms of favored models does not come as a surprise, as the three performance criteria differ in the penalty they put on including additional predictors into the model.

Adjusted R 2 incorporates the smallest and BIC the largest penalty. To complement insample fit based performance metrics, we scrutinize the cross-validation-based MSE of the candidate models. Successively including more predictors, MSEs for k = 5 and k = 10 decrease for the Top1 models with up to two predictors, remain relatively flat up to four predictors and increases for more than four predictors. These favored numbers of predictors are largely corroborated by considering not only the best model (Top1) but also its close competitors (Top2 to Top5).

Just as in the GPS module (Falk et al., 2022) we value brevity of the survey module and thus favor the BIC. However, we do not want to fully disregard adjusted R 2 and AIC, as the discrepancy of suggested predictors is rather large. We reconcile the number of predictors by following the best model according to cross validation, comprising two

predictors. This appears to be a reasonable compromise between BIC and AIC, which still puts a strong weight on brevity.


# Discussion and conclusion

We propose a two-question survey module, that allows measuring debt aversion in largescale surveys and experimental questionnaires with minimal effort and expenditure of time. The module is validated by use of an incentivized experiment, thus lending credibility to the resulting measure. In the following, we discuss the performance of the debt As a starting point, we consider the in-sample fit of the debt aversion survey module as indicator of quality. The module reaches an R 2 of 0.0945, i.e. it accounts for around 10% of the variation of the parameter of debt aversion (from the incentivized experiment). This corresponds to a correlation of ρ = 0.3073. As discussed for the GPS module (Falk et al., 2022), this correlation cannot be evaluated against a benchmark of 1, unless measurement of preferences (both in the structural estimations and in the response to the survey items) was without measurement error.

To evaluate measurement error, repeated measurement on the same participants would be helpful. While this was not done by Meissner and Albrecht (2022), the validation study for the GPS module finds a test-retest correlation of 0.5753 for risk aversion, and 0.8149 for time discounting when comparing their preference measure in one experiment to the same measure from an identical repeated experiment with the same participants (Falk et al., 2022). Evaluated against such a benchmark, our survey module appears to exhibit reasonable explanatory power for measuring debt aversion.

Beyond in-sample fit, the debt aversion survey module proves to be capable in terms Comparing our results to the module of the GPS (Falk et al., 2018(Falk et al., , 2022, we see the debt aversion survey module as a useful addition to measure debt aversion alongside 11 In Meissner and Albrecht (2022), participants had to come to the lab on a total of three dates, with a total time of around 2.5 hours.

12 Calculated as the mean absolute prediction error over the two different ks other key economic preferences in survey style investigations. A notable difference to the GPS module is that we do not identify the hypothetical version of incentivized choices, in our case the hypothetical debt contracts, as part of the set of the best-predictors of preferences. We see a likely explanation for this in the interdependence of debt aversion with other preference dimensions such as risk and loss aversion as well as discounting over time. As illustrated in Meissner and Albrecht (2022), the switch point in a multiple price list consisting of debt contracts will not only depend on individual debt aversion, but potentially also on time preferences, risk preferences and loss aversion.

Summing up, we develop a short and easy-to-use experimentally validated survey module to measure debt aversion. We hope that our survey module will facilitate future research on debt aversion on a larger scale, where complex and incentivized experiments are often not feasible.

We recommend implementing the survey module with the presented 6-point Likert scales, as this format is underlying all the validation procedures. However, should there be reasons to use Likert scales with more or less increments, the predicted debt aversion parameterγ, can be calculated from Likert scales with minimum l and maximum h by transforming the answers x to the 6-point scale. To this end, one needs to replace the numbers in brackets by:

x − l h − l × 5 + 1 (5)


## B Theoretical Framework

In Meissner and Albrecht (2022), agents choose between intertemporal prospects that are defined over streams of monetary gains or losses in up to two periods. x = (x t , x T ) denotes a stream of payments that offers x t at time t, and x T at time T , where 0 ≤ t < T . X = (x 1 , p 1 ; x 2 , p 2 ; ...; x N , p N ) denotes an intertemporal prospect, that gives the payment stream x n with probability p n . Intertemporal utility is written as:
U(X) = E [φ(t)v(x t ) + φ (T ) v(x T ) − ½ debt c (x)]
where v(x t ) denotes atemporal utility of monetary gains and losses at time t. Agents discount future gains and losses with the discount function φ.

Saving contracts are payment streams characterized by x t < 0 and x T > 0. Inversely, debt contracts are payment streams characterized by x t > 0 and x T < 0. Cost of being in debt c(x) is only incurred for debt contracts:
½ debt =      1 if x t > 0 and x T < 0 0 otherwise.
The specific functional forms used to estimate preference parameters are identical to Meissner and Albrecht (2022). Gains and losses of money are evaluated relative to a reference point (x = 0):
v(x) =      u(x) if x ≥ 0 −λu(−x) if x < 0,(6)
Utility in gains and losses is given by:
u(x) = (x + ε) 1−α − ε 1−α 1 − α(7)
The discount funcion is exponential:
φ(τ ) = 1 (1 + δ) τ(8)
Finally, the cost of being in debt is modelled as:
c(x) = (1 − γ)φ(T )v(x T )(9)
Here, γ is the parameter of debt aversion. A parameter of γ = 1 implies debt neutrality, γ > 1 implies debt aversion and γ < 1 implies debt affinity.

total of 127 people completed a three-session sequence of experiments in the behavioral and experimental laboratory BEElab at Maastricht University conducted over the years 2019 to 2021. Important for this work, they decided on a total of 90 binary prospects defined over payments at different points in time, lotteries, as well as saving and debt contracts. These choices can be grouped in seven different multiple price lists (MPLs) which are presented in Appendix C.

## 5
In line with Murphy and ten Brincke (2018) we do not consider the population distribution of the error parameter µ for hierarchical estimation, as it cannot be estimated and interpreted independently of other preference parameters.

imentally elicited debt aversion parameter γ per individual i as the dependent variable, and all possible subsets of the remaining 42 items as independent variables.

As subsets/combinations of predictors are sampled disregarding the order of elements and without the possibility to include the same element more than once the number of combinations reaches a maximum for models including 21 variables. For larger subsets, the number of potential combinations decreases again. There is only one subset containing all predictors from the pool. 10 For the creation of this shortlist we run a total of 36 211 980 regressions.

of predictive power. K-fold cross validation yields a mean absolute prediction error (based on 100 repeated random samples) of 0.0272 for k=5 and k=10. In other words, predicting γ using the debt aversion survey module suffers an average error of ca. 0.0272 12 . To set this into perspective we consider predicted choices for participants in the experiment of Meissner and Albrecht (2022) in comparison to their actual choices. Specifically, we consider predictions based on the debt aversion parameter from the survey module competing against predictions based on the structurally estimated debt aversion parameter as a benchmark. Survey module based predictions are accurate in 89.76%, while structural estimation based predictions are accurate in 91.48% of the decision situations in the experiment. Thus, the survey module performs similarly well in predicting choices compared to the structurally estimated parameter of debt aversion.

Evaluated in isolation, these quality metrics might understate the actual power of the survey module. In Section 5, we set the metrics into perspective by comparing them to suitable benchmarks in particular and by discussing the virtues and limitations of the survey module in general.Question/Item

All Likert scales follow a 6-point format, items without reference were created by the authors.D.2 Hypothetical Debt ContractsThe multiple price list on hypothetical debt contracts contains a total of 15 decisions.Aiming at brevity of the debt aversion survey module, its implementation and validity has been tested using the staircase method. Thus respondents effectively only see and make four yes/no choices. Participants are asked whether they would, hypothetically, accept four financial debt contracts, under which they receive 100A C today, with the obligation to repay between 60 to 140A C in six months:Imagine your bank offered you a debt contract. Under this contract you receive 100A C from your bank today and have to pay back XXA C in 6 months. Please assume that you
