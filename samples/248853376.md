Acne vulgaris is a common dermal ailment which is reported globally. Currently, a cross sectional survey (manual and online) in selective districts of Punjab region was conducted and it was concluded that disturbance in sebum production and frequent blockage of skin pores occur due to different potent factors which include improper dietary habits, side effects of medication, genetic complications, environmental conditions and lack of awareness of personal hygiene. Thus the future research efforts should be channelized to ensure provision of low coat and side effects free local pharmacognosal products for acne treatment along with its programmed general public awareness.

## INTRODUCTION

Acne is a common but chronic inflammatory dermal disease of the pilosebaceous unit [1]. Acne may start during adolescence and persist or have an onset in adulthood [2]. Recent global disease surveys indicate that acne vulgaris is the eight most common skin diseases, with an estimated global prevalence for all ages of 9.38% [3,4]. Acne is thought to be caused due to a major factor, excessive sebum production secondary to sebaceous gland hyperplasia [7]. Subsequent hyperkeratinization of the hair follicle prevents normal shedding of the follicular keratinocytes, which then obstruct the follicle and form an unapparent microcomedo [8]. Its onset basically happens due to disturbance in endocrine mechanisms which control the components of sebocyte functionnamely lipid synthesis, proliferation and differentiation [5]. Mostly teenagers face this for either shorter or longer duration [6].

Lipids and cellular debris soon accumulate within the blocked follicle. This microenvironment encourages colonization of propionic bacterium acnes, which provokes an immune response through the production of numerous inflammatory mediators. Inflammation is further enhanced by follicular rupture and subsequent leakage of lipids, bacteria, and fatty acids into the dermis [9] and gives rise to following types of acne (Table 1): 


## METHODOLOGY

This study was a cross-sectional survey [28] and data based on performa along with online survey were collected from acne patients of districts of Punjab, PK. This survey was designed for the estimation of level of awareness and vigilance towards acne control of general public of Lahore division. The obtained results were analyzed statistically via ANOVA and ttest [10,19].This study was approved by committee of Minhaj University Lahore. For this purpose, a performa was designed to collect data from patients (Table 2). During data collection, the verbal consent and privacy of participants was ensured [12]. 


## RESULTS & DISCUSSION

The ANOVA results of age groups showed that people belong to age group of 18-25years, significantly suffer more than either younger or older age groups (Table 3). Because reported data highlight that people of this age group are frequent consumers of high fat content containing diets along with poor unhygienic practice and as side effect acne triggers either due to improper diet or pathogenesis [20,21]. Whereas gender based comparison highlighted that 83% acne cases were of females and 39% of males. The root causes might be use of more spicy and oily food, poor hygienic practices, intake of less water, intake of any medication and frequent use of inappropriate and low grade cosmetics [22]. The oil that is made in the skin is called sebum, and it is produced in oil glands called sebaceous glands. Sebum protects the skin and helps to keep it moisturized [5,6]. But if a layer of dead cells blocks the opening of a pore, the sebum can't leave the pore. It builds up in the sebaceous gland, and a blackhead or whitehead develops. If this becomes inflamed, it turns into a pimple [6]. Acne mostly develops on areas of skin that have more oil glands, like the face, chest, back and shoulders [7].The main reason teenagers get acne is because their bodies make more androgen hormones during puberty [8]. But not all teenagers have acne. For this reason, it is believed that other things play a role too, such as genetic factors and the immune system [7,8]. Furthermore, table 4 is presenting the t-test results of comparative prevalence of acne at district level. Moreover, the role of body weight was not found as potent factor of acne that is why; ANOVA results showed that people with normal body weight (Group A) are suffering mainly due to acne (Table 5). Because under specific conditions only, high fat and sugar containing diets may stimulate acne [23]. Similarly, results related to acne symptoms were quite helpful to know disease pattern, first of all, females are more prone to acne and among them majority face pimples, and black and white heads ( Figure 1).


## Fig-1: Gender based frequency of acne symptoms

In addition to this, when data based on skin type (Figure 2), locations of acne on body (Figure 3), dietary habits of acne vulgaris patients (Figure 4), estimation of causative agents ( Figure 5) and gender based medicinal treatment trends observations ( Figure  6) clearly indicate that the areas of body which are more exposed to the external environment at greater risk, females suffer more and still ignore its proper treatment. The root causes are not only the intake of imbalance diet, microbial infections, exposure to some aflatoxins [26,29] but also the lack of awareness about management and control of acne vulgaris [24]. 


## CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE

People with acne often try out different things to improve the appearance of their skin. There are a lot of different recommendations when it comes to acne, involving things like facial toners, sunlight and specific diet [9]. Either lotions or hydrogels are recommended for skin care. Greasy creams can clog the pores in your skin even more. Soap-free cleansing products that have a similar slightly acidic pH to skin are a good idea too. There are also a number of medications for acne, to be applied to the skin or swallowed. Some treatment approaches and medications have been proven to effectively reduce acne, while others have not. Examples of effective treatments include benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics and retinoids [10]. Acne treatment usually requires patience; most products have to be used for a long time before there is a noticeable improvement. The treatment may take months or even years. Every treatment can have side effects, too [10,11]. That is why; cost effective and local pharmacognosal products [25,27] should be manufactured and promoted by future researchers and practitioners along with general public awareness campaigns at national and international levels about skin hygiene, care and in time cure of acne vulgaris [30].
