Rasasastra an independently originated science which became a significant part of Ayurveda deals with the pharmaceutics and therapeutic aspects of the metals and minerals. Rasaratna samucchaya is a well known Rasasastra textbook which describes both the aspects of various Rasaushadhis. A literature review on Swarna kalpas mentioned in Rasaratna samucchaya has been conducted here. The available data was classified and tabulated in the order of chapters. A total of 52 formulations were identified with presence of Swarna as an ingredient and among them, more number of formulations (10) were mentioned in Vajikarana adhyaya compared to other chapters.

## INTRODUCTION

Rasasastra or Ayurvedic alchemy is a branch of science that deals with the use metals, minerals, gemstones and their processing. Compared to the herbal preparation Rasaushadhis are considered more potent due to the faster action & assimilation even in smallest doses 1 . Among the classification of Dhatus or metals, Rasasastra mentioned Swarna or gold as the primary one. A therapeutically ideal gold should be smooth, heavy, attractive, shines like a sun on heating and devoid of adulterants like silver & copper 2 . Such an ideal Swarna was told to possess qualities like, Madhura rasa 3 , Seeta veerya 3 , Madhura vipaka 4 and trisoshaharatwa 4 . It also have the properties like, Medhya (promote intellect), Brimhana (nourishing), Vrishya (aphrodisiac), Vishahara (removes toxins), Ruchya (improves taste perception), Rujaharam (relieves pain) and Netrya (improves eye sight). Even though Swarna have such phenomenal qualities, the therapeutic use of Swarna kalpas in present era has been very much limited. So, a review has been conducted to identify various Swarna kalpas, their benefits and practical utility. Rasaratna samucchaya is a 13 th century treatise, deals with the therapeutic aspects of Rasasastra and emphasize the use of metals and minerals in treating nearly 68 types of ailments 5 . It contains 30 chapters, 3871 verses and detailed description of 960 formulations. The first 11 chapters are related with the theoretical and pharmaceutical aspects of Rasasastra while, 12 to 30 th chapters represents the therapeutic aspects of Rasasastra. 12 to 25 th chapters describes about various diseases including the pathology, types, symptoms and many useful formulations. 26 to 28 th chapters are devoted to Jara roga (geriatric diseases), Rasayana (rejuvenation), and Vajikarana chikitsa (aphrodisiac therapy) respectively through use of both herbal and herbomineral formulations. Last three chapters (28-30) represents treatment of different ailments through the use of specific drugs, they are Lauha kalpa (formulations of iron), Visha kalpa (formulations of poisonous drugs), and Rasa kalpa (formulations contain mercury). Rasaratna samucchaya is the only Rasasastra textbook that deals with all the eight branches of Ayurveda. So, in order to understand the therapeutic uses of Swarna in various fields of Ayurveda, Rasaratna samucchaya was selected as the review text book.


## MATERIALS AND METHODS

A literature review on Swarna kalpas (gold containing formulations) available in Rasaratna samucchaya was conducted and the data related to the formulations has been classified in the order of chapters with Prakarana.    Soothendra rasa is a formulation mentioned in Vajikarana adhyaya comes under the Kupipakwa rasayana. There are two Pottali kalpanas namely Hemagarbha pottali and Lokanatha rasa mentioned in the Rajayakshma adhikara. The practical approach of Pottali preparation involves four different methods, and among them these two formulations comes under the Varatika poorana method. The Swarna is told to possess snigdha, Medhya, Brimhana, Vrishya, Tridoshahara properties and is indicated in Dhatu kshayaja conditions like rajayakshma 6 . By converting the Swarna yogas into more potent Kalpanas it can cure even the most chronic disease conditions.

A total of 52 formulations were identified with the presence of Swarna as an ingredient and among them, more number of formulations (10) were mentioned in Vajikarana adhyaya compared to other chapters. Among the formulations, majority (90%) of them were comes under Kharaliya rasayanas. 2 formulations were included under Pottali kalpana and one each from Kupipakwa, Leha and Lepa kalpanas.
