## Terminology

This paper was originally delivered at the table ronde "Bâtir un État 'normand' aux XI e -XII e s." in March 2019. Prompted by the very title of the table ronde with its implicit assumption that there were indeed states in the worlds inhabited by the Normans, the paper begins by addressing the fundamental questions of terms and definitions. Not all historians would agree that the term "state" is appropriate for the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Furthermore, even if the term is deemed to be appropriate, the next question is how their essential characteristics are to be defined 1 ? The kind of features we might expect to see include relatively settled boundaries, and the existence of an independent authority capable of maintaining order, raising resources, and securing the allegiance of its inhabitants over and above family loyalties.

Tabularia « Études », « Vivre des deux côtés de la Manche », 2020Manche », , p. 1-19, 16 avril 2020 Were there states in the eleventh century?

The term "statebuilding" has connotations of construction, of positive movement, perhaps towards modernity, as it was for J. R. Strayer 2 . It could be regarded as a problematic term to use in the context of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. T. N. Bisson's book, The Crisis of the Twelfth Century explicitly challenged the idea that there were European "states" or "government" before the late twelfth century, focussing instead on lordship, which might be associated with rulership, as in Normandy and England 3 . Lordship was violent and self-interested, he argued, and it was only when forced by changing economic circumstances to take account of the ruled that there was movement towards a more associative form of government, and thus the origins of the modern state. His thesis developed out of his earlier views that Carolingian agencies collapsed around the year one thousand, to be replaced by lords and castles 4 . It is a debate which has now been exhausted and, one might argue, did not really fit the development of ducal Normandy, and certainly did not match eleventh-century England.


## Was eleventh-century Normandy a state?

A first answer to this question is negative: Normandy surely was a province of the kingdom of France. Yet Normandy in the mid-eleventh century or even earlier seems to fit the definition of a state, with relatively settled boundaries, a powerful duke, and a strong sense of regional identity. Crucial to the question of sovereignty or independence was the relationship between the dukes and the kings of West Francia and then the Capetians. Those who wrote of Norman history from Dudo onwards were sensitive to the nuances of that relationship. If the dukes made acts of submission -and it is by no means certain that they did -what did these signify 5 ? In 1120 the son and heir of Henry I did perform homage, but this act, as John Gillingham has pointed out, was in order that Louis VI would accept William as heir to Normandy, rather than his cousin 6 . Later it was said that homage had been performed to the son of Louis VI not to the king himself 7 . By this time the significance of such acts of homage was changing. For Jean-François Lemarignier it was a shift from hommage en marche to hommage réel 8 . The next 4 Vivre des deux côtés de la Manche URL : http://journals.openedition.org/tabularia/4247 | DOI : 10.4000/tabularia.4247 clear case of homage occurred in 1151 9 . Henry FitzEmpress as duke submitted to Louis VII 10 . John Gillingham has looked closely at the meetings between kings of France and dukes of Normandy and, arguing for a distinction between acts of homage, meetings, and visits, thinks that Henry II's homage in 1183 marked a turning point 11 . I shall return to this point later.


## Was there an Anglo-Saxon "State"?

The Anglo-Saxon kingdom was defined as a state by, amongst others, the late James Campbell in his 1991 Raleigh lecture 12 . Whilst some have wondered about the usefulness of the term "state" in this context, there is a general acceptance that the kingdom was relatively closely governed 13 . Subsequent debate has continued to centre on the question of continuity and change after 1066. Did William and his Normans take over a well-developed apparatus of governance and make it work effectively as Haskins -and many other historians -thought 14 ? Or, did the newcomers simply use native English officials and exploit English resources for what they could get out of them until governance began to break down in the early twelfth century and then collapsed more generally under Stephen, to be revived and reordered under Henry II 15 ?


## Was there an Anglo-Norman Empire?

Historians have grappled with different ways of describing the link between Normandy and England after 1066 16 . In their different ways the late Warren Hollister and John Le Patourel argued for a single political entity, rather than two. For Hollister this was a regnum and for Le Patourel it was an empire 17 . Recently the idea of empire has been explored by David Bates and Fanny Madeline 18 . David described William the Conqueror in his Ford Lectures as "the maker of empire" 19 . Of course, England was only one political entity in the British Isles. Although England and Normandy are the focus here, the Scottish and Welsh kingdoms bordered and interacted with England and Normandy.

## Governmental developments

Turning to the main themes of recent research into statebuilding in the Anglo-Norman world, there is, first of all, the governance of England and Normandy. What arrangements were made for deputies? As we know, in 1066 the Conqueror left his wife and loyal magnates in charge in Normandy 20 . The absences from England both of the Conqueror and William Rufus were managed in different ways at different times 21 . In 1104 Henry I used his wife as regent, and after her death relied on Bishop Roger of Salisbury. Roger presided over the exchequer, and in 1123 was appointed viceroy during the king's absence in Normandy 22 . It used to be thought that in Normandy Bishop John of Lisieux had a comparable role, but this view has been challenged by Mark Hagger, who has argued that the king remained the sole source of authority 23 .

How far were the people involved in governance confined to one side of the Channel or the other? How often was revenue moved? What about parallel developments to deal with practical problems? One was the increasing use of local justices or justiciars on both sides of the Channel 24 ; another was the farming out of revenues and the introduction of courts of audit, the exchequers 25 . As well as parallel development was the introduction of practices developed in Normandy into England and vice versa. One example was the introduction into England of trial by battle which so far as is known, had not been used in Anglo-Saxon England 26 . Another was the introduction into Normandy of writs, though these did not supersede the types of document more usually used in Normandy 27 .

There is also the way military obligation developed in England and in Normandy after 1066, too often discussed in isolation from each other. It seems (though evidence is sketchy) that many Normans in 1066 accepted that they owed the duke service for at least some of their lands 28 . In England, too, military obligation was owed on land 29 . On both sides of the Channel, the great men were bound by oaths of loyalty and they and their retinues formed the core of  vol. 2, p. 220. 21. West, 1966, p. 2-13;. 22. Green, 2006, p. 79, 136, 182. 23. Hagger, 2017. For justiciars in Normandy see now Hagger, 2017, p. 351-352; for England see Green, 1986, p. 107-110;Karn, 2009. 25. Hagger, 2017 Hudson, 2012, p. 731-732, 739-740. 27. Hagger, 2009Bates, 1985. 28. See most recently Hagger, 2017, p. 664. 29. Brooks, 2012 6 Vivre des deux côtés de la Manche URL : http://journals.openedition.org/tabularia/4247 | DOI : 10.4000/tabularia.4247 the rulers' armies. In England after 1066 the distribution of land to the incomers was on the basis of a contract whereby the lord provided service for his land, and by the twelfth century that service was quantified. A similar trend is perceptible in Normandy, whereby the duke's tenants-in-chief were assessed for service in respect of their land 30 . It is hard to see these as separate developments, not least because in many cases lords held land on both sides of the Channel. Understanding the range of possibilities of transfer, imitation, or parallel developments has enriched our understanding of governance.


## New biographies

There have been several biographical studies of the Conqueror and his sons which have tackled the question of their involvement in governance. This might seem old-style "great man" history, but these biographies are very different from their predecessors. Studies of the Conqueror and William Rufus, necessarily forefront their role in war, or "hard power" to pick up Bates's use of the term 31 . A major theme of Bates's biography is violence and the extent to which the Conqueror conformed to contemporary norms of acceptable violence 32 . His regime brought peace, but peace involved holding down the native population through economic warfare in the north, the building of castles, and harsh justice 33 . In the case of William Rufus war had to be financed, and the devices used by his chief agent, Ranulf Flambard, brought criticism from the chroniclers but, as his most recent biographer has pointed out, Rufus was also celebrated as a warrior and generous lord 34 . As far as Robert Curthose was concerned, his reputation as a fine warrior established on the first crusade was acknowledged, but he was excoriated for his uselessness as duke by critics who were writing after his defeat and imprisonment 35 . That his rule suffered from the destabilizing efforts of William Rufus and then of Henry I is clear. Richard Allen has recently reminded us of the duke's inability to exercise the same degree of influence over ecclesiastical appointments as his father 36 .

Henry I's contribution has enjoyed a much better reputation. Those who wrote in the twelfth century after his death and in the context of the disorder that broke out on both sides of the Channel praised the peace he had brought to England and Normandy. In the twentieth century there were sharply different assessments of the fear he undoubtedly inspired, and of his personal contribution to administrative developments 37 . By extending and consolidating his rule in 30. Hagger, 2017, p. 667-674. 31. Bates, 2013, p. 4. 32. Bates, 2016. Cf. Hagger, 2012. 33. Lambert, 2017. Discussed most recently by Gillingham, 2015. 35.

# Power and Statebuilding in the Anglo-Norman World…

Tabularia « Études », « Vivre des deux côtés de la Manche », 2020, p. 1-19, 16 avril 2020 northern England Henry achieved what none of his predecessors had done, a more complete integration of the north 38 . Hagger has emphasized the parallel developments in finance and justice, the establishment of farms and exchequers, the rising use of justices and the way Henry sought to maintain law and order 39 . There is certainly a case for saying that of the Norman rulers Henry achieved most by way of statebuilding. However, Bisson did not agree, commenting that this was not "governance" but an exercise of personal power 40 . Nor was Henry's rule an unqualified success, if we include, as we must, the years after 1120. By this time problems with the coinage were becoming acute 41 . His decision to have oaths sworn to his widowed daughter as his successor before her second marriage, caused problems 42 . The sheer range of his territories has been seen as imposing a degree of strain 43 .


## New themes and topics

In recent years there has been a focus on different aspects of rulership. The role of the two queens Matilda in deputizing for their husbands and complementing their rule is better understood 44 . Ideas about good governance as reflected in narrative texts composed on both sides of the Channel have been studied, and were arguably more influential in restraining rulers' behaviour than Bisson, for instance, allowed. Rituals such as crownwearings, feasting, gift-giving, and dress have been studied 45 . The royal hunt was at once an opportunity for companionship and display albeit underpinned by arbitrary and punitive forest laws 46 . The physical context of rulership has been studied, though much remains to be done. The grandeur of the White Tower, and the scale of western fortification in London, the castle and palace at Winchester, William Rufus's great halls at Westminster and Caen, and the development of York as a northern capital all displayed wealth and power 47 . The Norman frontier came to be ringed by stone castles built under Henry I 48 .

The lay lords provided the tools of conquest, and they played a key role in the Anglo-Norman state 49 . They were literally in unknown territory. Bargains had to be negotiated about their obligations to the king and their rights over their newly-acquired lands 50 . From the king's point of view it was crucial that the new lords accepted their obligations to provide military service and financial contributions (geld) towards ships, tribute, and payment of professional soldiers. In the past argument centred round the question of how precisely Norman ideas of lordship differed from those of their English predecessors, until the debate really ran out of steam. However, it has recently been argued that the great lords, or tenants-in-chief were granted exemption from geld on their demesne land, for which they would provide personal service, and their tenanted land would be liable for geld 51 . Liability to geld proved tricky: William Rufus promised to alleviate it in 1088 in a bid for support, as did Henry I in 1100 52 .

There is a long tradition of studying Norman lordships in England, but our knowledge of political geography in the duchy is still patchy. We also need a comparative survey of the powers of lords over their peasants 53 . There has been a revolution in castle studies with important repercussions for how they are seen as symbols of power, on both sides of the Channel 54 . First, English castles are seen as developing from earlier fortified residences 55 . Secondly, their siting in the landscape, together with deer parks, ponds etc., has been emphasized 56 . Thirdly, the form of hall-chamber towers may have been exported from England to Normandy rather than the other way round 57 .

Bishops played a crucial role in the transition from war to peace in Norman England 58 . The succession of newcomers, mainly Normans of whom the king approved, was crucially important in shaping the regime. Through a series of councils Archbishop Lanfranc was able to push ahead both with reforming Christian society and reorganizing the English church 59 . Individual bishops, with great landed wealth at their disposal, competed with each other in the construction of vast new cathedrals 60 . They established territorial archdeacons who began to hold church courts separate from shire courts 61 . Bishops had an essential role 49. Green, 2017, p. 100-124. 50.

In England, as in Normandy, William kept close control over ecclesiastical appointments. So far as Normandy is concerned, the project to publish the acta of bishops will allow much closer comparison of the churches of Normandy and England, and their relations with Rome 63 .

Benedictine abbeys, full of English monks, began to have Norman heads drawn from the great ducal houses, especially Jumièges, Fécamp, and Bec 64 . It was in monastic communities that the great old English saints were particularly venerated, and the construction of new shrines brought natives and newcomers together in new solidarities. Benedictine communities, as Alain Boureau has argued, helped to shape ideas about how kings ought to behave, a point recently re-emphasized by Emily Winkler 65 . Thanks to Véronique Gazeau we have a much clearer idea of the role of abbots in Norman society, and she has suggested that it was basically individuals, like Lanfranc at Caen, or Boso at Le Bec, who played a prominent role 66 .

Greater consideration has been given to the location and type of frontiers, and to the nature of frontier society. Settled frontiers were, and are, after all, integral to states. The old view about the construction of Normandy was of a three-stage process, essentially complete by the mid-tenth century 67 . Now, thanks to the work of Pierre Bauduin and other scholars, we are aware of a much more protracted process by which Normandy reached its historic limits 68 . Mark Hagger, for instance, argued that only with the capture of Verneuil-sur-Avre in about 1120 did the duchy reach that point 69 .

In the case of England, there were open frontiers to the north and west. In the north the fate of the southern portions of the pre-Viking kingdoms of Northumbria and Strathclyde had yet to be permanently decided. In both cases it was the Normans who established bridgeheads, through the building of a castle at Carlisle in the north-west, and in the north-east through the establishment of Norman lords, some as under-tenants of the bishop of Durham 70 . In the north William Rufus and Henry I were able to use the claims to hereditary succession by the sons of Malcolm III to assert their own superior over-or high kingship, but they did not attempt to conquer land north of the Solway and Tweed 71 .  Cramer, 1989. 63. The English Episcopal Acta series is being paralleled by a project to publish the acts of Norman bishops. See Allen, 2015. 64.

For the idea of over-or high-kingship see Davies, 2000, p. 4-30;Bates, 2013, p. 93-94. 10 Vivre des deux côtés de la Manche URL : http://journals.openedition.org/tabularia/4247 | DOI : 10.4000/tabularia.4247 In the west the situation was different. Here there were several local rulers who fought each other as well as the English. The frontier between England and Wales was shifting and the new Norman lords, like their English predecessors, soon made inroads into Welsh territory. King William saw himself as having inherited a superior or high kingship over Welsh rulers, and in 1081 he himself went into Wales as far as Cardiff 72 . In the late eleventh century, especially in the north, where the Welsh king Gruffydd ap Cynan allied with Magnus Barelegs, the Welsh made a comeback. Henry I's policy was different from his father's: he made two expeditions into Wales. He sought not to conquer but to overawe. He accepted submissions from Welsh princes and rewarded those prepared to stay loyal with subsidies. Those Normans who held territory in Wales were able to establish relatively autonomous lordships, and these, like the large lordships in the north-west, acted in effect to protect the more intensively settled midlands and south.

The differences between the Scottish and Welsh experiences are significant. The Scots rulers were styled as kings in charters and king lists and, although they were not anointed and crowned, their royal status was acknowledged by their southern neighbours 73 . The Welsh rulers claimed royal status and, as in Scotland, genealogies provided a history of such claims but, it has been argued, their authority was not such as to form the basis of states, however small 74 . Charter diplomatic provides an insight into changing political culture. It has been noted how variable royal styles were, with a shift in the later twelfth century to three houses only claiming authority over a wide region, Gwynedd, Deheubarth, and Powys 75 . Thus the story of kings or princes in Britain is more complex than is usually suggested. Royal inauguration rites formed part of the story, as did the possession of an archbishopric. The kings of Scots were working to this end from at least the time of Alexander I and were ultimately successful, whereas the efforts of the Welsh were ultimately to fail. So changing political culture has to take account of the way Welsh and Scottish rulers saw themselves, and the way they were regarded by the more powerful English kings. Moreover, the significance of their acts of submission, too, changed over time.  Broun, 2007, p. 48-61. The Norman kings did not challenge the Scots kings' claims to kingship but accepted their submissions as lesser to high kings. The authenticity of a key charter issued by King Edgar to Durham of 1095, in which he refers to himself as holding "the land (terram) of Lothian and kingdom of the Scots by the gift of my lord king William and by paternal inheritance" has been disputed. Early Scottish Charters, A. Campbell Lawrie (ed.), no. xv, p. 12-13;Duncan, 1958 thought the charter was genuine; Donnelly, 1989 disputed this; Duncan, 1999 reasserted his original view. It may be argued that the terms "gift" and "inheritance" applied to both Lothian and Scotland, rather than "gift" to Lothian and "inheritance" to Scotland, and in any case reflect a Durham perspective. For the medieval Scottish state see now Taylor, 2016, p. 1-12. 74. Moore, 1996, p. 50-51. 75. Insley, 2008Pryce, 2007, p. 49.


## Power and Statebuilding in the Anglo-Norman World…

Tabularia « Études », « Vivre des deux côtés de la Manche », 2020Manche », , p. 1-19, 16 avril 2020 agree, the terms of the Treaty of Falaise in 1174 arguably marked a step-change in the relationship between the kings of Scots and England, by asserting English dominion over the Scottish kingdom 76 .

Coined money and thus towns and cities were crucial to statebuilding. The importance of cities and towns such as Caen and Rouen is being recognized, though there are still gaps in our knowledge about other Norman towns 77 . The role of London was particularly significant in the making of the English state, particularly from the reigns of AEthelred and then the Danish kings 78 . Its importance was political, fiscal, and economic, as a centre for trade. The London mint played a major role in producing coined money for eleventh-century kings 79 . The quality of English coinage, and the royal monopoly of coinage, were jewels in his crown 80 . The Conqueror appreciated the city's importance. He chose to land on the south coast of England. He only approached London after his victory at Hastings, and he was quick to have castles built to dominate the city 81 . He and his successors could draw on wealthy merchants including a new Jewish community who were able to advance funds 82 . However, the diminishing supply of silver was causing severe difficulties by the early twelfth century, and came to a head in 1124 when Henry I ordered the mutilation of the English moneyers for adulterating the quality of coins 83 . For the king a reliable supply of coin and access to those with wealth underpinned the transition from war to peace.


## Conclusion

This paper began with the issue of terminology, and whether we can appropriately use the word "state" in connection, either with England, or Normandy, or with a single Anglo-Norman polity. There is no doubt that the governance of England was shaped by the Norman Conquest in terms of royal wealth and further integration of the realm. King William was vastly richer than his predecessor had been. He had reconfigured the political elite to suit his ends, and his influence over ecclesiastical preferment in England, as it had been in Normandy, was pervasive. His power was thus more immediate, even tyrannous, a point made by the chronicler Aelnoth of Canterbury when safely out of the country 84 . The maintenance of the courts of shire and hundred helped to prevent too much privatization of justice in lords' courts, thus ensuring the development of royal 76.

Van Houts, 1995 Vivre des deux côtés de la Manche URL : http://journals.openedition.org/tabularia/4247 | DOI : 10.4000/tabularia.4247 justice and the common law 85 . Though regional differences remained important, the north was integrated into the realm more fully than before. The king still depended on the support of the great men, and the elite continued to participate in councils. These evolved seamlessly from the old English witan into parliament and eventually into the parliamentary democracy of modern times 86 .

However, we must not get carried away by these signs of strength and centralized royal power. Much still depended on the personal presence of the ruler. For all the increasing numbers of officials and documents, when the ruler was absent it was still remarkably easy to defy his wishes. Secondly, much also depended on a smooth transition of power. The contested successions of 1087 and 1100 provoked insecurity and rebellion. Indeed George Garnett would go further and argue that these were technically interregna 87 . The declining quality of English coinage, as noted above, caused problems for Henry I. And, if some Englishmen were able to transition to the new elite and thrive, bitterness remained, articulated by churchmen who saw their fellow countrymen passed over 88 .

And what of Normandy? I suggested above that Normandy in 1066 arguably fulfilled basic criteria for a state: an effectively independent ruler, relatively stable boundaries, and a strong sense of identity. In the medium term William Rufus and Henry I had the resources to defend the duchy against the kings of France. Yet the desire to secure the duchy's future for his own heirs meant that Henry was prepared to acknowledge an obligation to provide military service 89 . This, as well as his son's homage to the son of Louis VI, were straws in the wind. The frequent meetings of Henry II with Louis VII and then Philip Augustus, can only have increased tensions, especially in 1183 when Henry did homage to Philip Augustus. There was continuing sensitivity towards the suzerainty of the Capetians shown in the writings of Stephen of Rouen and Wace 90 . Normandy was to lose its independence formally in 1204, but perhaps this should be seen as the end of a process with several key turning points, rather than a single event.

Finally, the problem remains of finding the most accurate term for the dominions ruled together for protracted periods after 1066. The descriptions "Norman Empire" or "Anglo-Norman state" are a convenient shorthand but hardly do justice to the complexities of relationships, both within the British Isles and between the kingdom and the duchy. This paper has focussed on research 85. Green, 1990;Lambert, 2017, p. 349-363. 86. Maddicott, 2010, p. 57-97. 87. Garnett, 2007 trends devoted to agents and agencies of governance, and for reasons of space has said relatively little about contemporary perceptions as recorded in narrative sources. Yet chronicles make clear that both the kingdom and the duchy retained their own traditions and identities within a wider context, and so the discussion of terms will undoubtedly continue.
