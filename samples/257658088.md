Sharpless introduced this methodology after considering the importance of enantioselectivity in the total synthesis of medicinally important compounds. Vicinal diols, produced as a result of this reaction, act as intermediates in the synthesis of different naturally occurring compounds. Hence, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation plays an important role in synthetic organic chemistry due to its undeniable contribution to the synthesis of biologically active organic compounds. This review emphasizes the significance of Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation in the total synthesis of various natural products, published since 2020.3 of 58 combating the spread of tumor cells and exhibiting high efficacy against malarial infections, respectively[23][24][25]. Our review highlights the recent applications of Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation for the synthesis of various natural products.2. Review of the Literature 2.1. Synthesis of Alkaloid-Based Natural Products 2.1.1. Lycorine-Type Alkaloids Zephyranthine belongs to the class of lycorine alkaloids, which are known for their medicinal usage[26]. Members of this class have been found to interrupt the acetylcholine activity and uncontrolled division of cancer cells[27]. Zhao et al.[28]in 2021 reported the efficient synthesis of (-)-zephyranthine by utilizing two one-pot reactions. Evans' nickel (II) catalyst 9 initiated the synthesis by reacting unsaturated β-ketoeaster 5 and nitro olefin 8 via a series of Michael addition reactions. Both reactants 5 and 8 were prepared individually. In this regard, starting material 2,2,6-trimethyl-[1,3]dioxin-4-one 3 was reacted with diethylchlorophosphite and LiHMDS followed by oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, thereby giving compound 4 in 90% yield, which was then reacted with methanol and sodium hydride in the presence of tetrahydrofuran to give compound 5 in 87% yield. Then, substituted carbaldehyde 6 was reacted with p-TSA and ethylene glycol followed by treatment with toluene and diethylether, which resulted in the synthesis of compound 7 in 90% yield. The compound 7 was then reacted with MeNO 2 and trifluoroacetic acid to obtain compound 8 in 84% yield. For the first Michael addition, use of toluene and Triton B were considered to be effective after optimizing the various reaction conditions. This reaction resulted in 85% yield of penta-substituted cyclohexane 10, which is highly enantioselective (90% ee) and (>20:1) diastereoselective in nature. In order to prevent the undesirable aldol reaction, the enol moiety in 10 was protected by treating with benzoylchloride (BzCl) in the presence of pyridine, which resulted in 97% yield of benzoate 11 with more than 99% enantioselectivity. The compound 11 was cyclized through one-pot reaction on treatment with HBr and acetic acid in the presence of tetrahydrofuran followed by reaction with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid, obtaining intermediate 12 in 57% yield. The resulting intermediate was treated with Comins' reagent and LiHMDS in the presence of tetrahydrofuran, resulting in the synthesis of triflate, which was further treated with palladium acetate, formic acid and triphenylphosphine to synthesize compound 13 in 85% yield. In the last step, enantioselective synthesis of zephyranthine 14 in quantitative yield (67%) with 7.2:1 diastereoselectivity ratio was achieved by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation on reaction with AD-mix-β in the presence of tetrahydrofuran or water (Scheme 2).Muscarine AlkaloidThere are several tetrahydrofurans containing natural products including various alkaloids such as muscarine, epi-muscarine and allo-muscarine, which are extracted from Amanita muscaria, i.e., a mushroom species[29]. Muscarine and its derivatives are highly potent pharmacological agents that also act as acetylcholine inhibitors[30]. Owing to their wide biological importance, Gehlawat et al.[31]in 2020 reported the total synthesis of epi-mucarine alkaloid by using various reactions including Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, cyclization by bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction, and cleavage of epoxide ring. In the first step, (p-methoxybenzyl) glycidyl ether 15 was treated with propyl lithium in the presence of boron triflouride diethyl etherate followed by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride, resulting in the synthesis of compound 16 in 86% yield. The compound 16 was further treated with tosyl chloride in the presence of dimethyl aminopyridine and triethylamine followed by reaction with osmium tetroxide and potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) via Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to obtain tosyl protected diol intermediate 17. This newly synthesized intermediate was subjected to base catalyzed reaction to prepare compound 18 in 90% yield. Compound 18 was further made to react with cerium ammonium nitrate in the presence of acetonitrile followed by Molecules 2023, 28, 2722 4 of 58 treatment with imidazole, pyrrolidine and toluene.

## Introduction

Asymmetric synthesis plays an important role in the stereoisomeric and enantiomeric synthesis of drugs [1]. In this regard, Sharpless in the 1980s introduced Sharpless epoxidation, which is a facile methodology for the asymmetric synthesis of 2,3-epoxy alcohols by using primary and secondary allylic alcohols [2]. Considering the importance of enantioselective synthesis of Sharpless epoxidation, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was then employed by Sharpless to synthesize vicinal diols [3,4]. In this methodology, chiral vicinal diol moiety is obtained by the reaction of an alkene with osmium tetroxide in the presence of an optically active quinine ligand [5,6].

The presence of a chiral ligand is the primary requirement for osmium catalyzed bishydroxylation [7]. Since the inception of this protocol, various co-oxidant ligands have been employed by different researchers. However, it was inferred that low yields of diol were obtained by employing stoichiometric oxidants, i.e., H 2 O 2 and NaClO 3 or KClO3 [8,9]. Improvements in the yield of target molecules were observed by employing Upjohn dihydroxylation in the presence of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide and by using alkaline tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) [10]. Moreover, potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) has been found to be the most effective in recent times. Similarly, Sharpless also utilized this optically active terminal oxidant for the bishydroxylation of alkenes [11]. As time passed, Sharpless and his coworkers devoted their attention to the use of cinchona alkaloids as chiral ligands, which gave tremendous yields with high enantioselectivity. Later on, pyrimidine and phthalazine incorporated dimeric alkaloids were employed as asymmetric ligands for the efficient synthesis of vicinal diols. K 2 OsO 2 (OH) 4 , K 2 CO 3 , (DHQD) 2 PHAL, (DHQ) 2 PHAL, and K 3 Fe(CN) 6 were found to be mandatory chemical substances for carrying out Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. The mixture of these four reagents is referred to as "AD-mix". The (DHQ) 2 PHAL-containing mixture is termed "AD-mix-α", while "AD-mix-β" includes (DHQD) 2 PHAL as ligand [11,12]. The general scheme for osmium-catalyzed asymmetric dihydroxylation is given below [12] (Scheme 1). [8,9].

## Scheme 1. Osmium-catalyzed asymmetric dihydroxylation.

Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation has found tremendous applications in the synthesis of a variety of naturally occurring biologically active compounds [13,14]. Total synthesis of various natural products such as alkaloids, lactones, amino acids, flavones, polyketides, macrolides, glycosides, terpenes, etc., involves Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation as an integral step [15][16][17][18]. This protocol results in the high enantioselectivity of vicinal diols, which are then reacted further in the presence of required reagents to synthesize the desired medicinally important target molecules [19,20]. The following figure illustrates the structure of a few biologically important natural products, whose total synthesis is achieved by employing Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation as an essential step ( Figure 1) [21,22].

There are a huge number of other applications of Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. For example, Sharpless AD has been found to be the main step in the total synthesis of Codonopsinine, Synargenotolides, Noneneolide and many more, which are isolated from different plant extracts and play a vital role against a number of bacterial diseases, in and potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) via Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to obtain tosyl protected diol intermediate 17. This newly synthesized intermediate was subjected to base catalyzed reaction to prepare compound 18 in 90% yield. Compound 18 was further made to react with cerium ammonium nitrate in the presence of acetonitrile followed by treatment with imidazole, pyrrolidine and toluene. Synthesis of epi-muscarine 19 was achieved by treatment with trimethyl amine and methanol in 95% yield (Scheme 3).

#### Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloid

A major class of natural products comprises monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), which are effective against a wide range of bacterial, viral and neurological disorders [32]. These are also useful against tumor-causing agents [33,34]. Depending upon the positioning of atoms, MIAs are divided into three categories, most of which are derived from different parts of Alstonia scholaris. Zhang et al. in 2020 [35] proposed the total synthesis of two important MIAs, i.e., alstolarines A and B. They stated that the total synthesis could be initiated with the forerunner difforlemenine 20, which could be subjected to reduction followed by ring opening reaction, leading to the generation of compound 21. Then, nucleophilic substitution could result in the synthesis of compound 22, a common precursor in the synthesis of alstolarines A and B. For the synthesis of alstolarine A, compound 22 could be subjected to dehydration followed by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to obtain compound 23, which could synthesize target Scheme 3.

Similarly, oxidation and removal of carboxylic acid could synthesize alstolarine B 25 (Scheme 4). Both compounds were tested for their acetylcholinase inhibitory potential, and molecule 25 showed average inhibitory potential with an IC 50 value = 19.3 µM.


#### Glyphaeaside Alkaloids

The glyphaeaside alkaloids are a class of iminosugars that are found in nature, as they are derived from plants, i.e., Glyphaea brevis [36]. These natural products belong to the family of carbohydrates whose structures are composed of many hydroxyl groups along with phenylalkyl side-chains [37]. On the basis of the arrangement of he iminosugar center, the glyphaeasides have been categorized into three classes, named A, B and C. Glyphaeaside C, which was formerly referred to as 1-deoxynojirimycin, has been found to exhibit highly efficient inhibitory activity against β-glucosidase and snail β-mannosidase. However, it was determined that the inhibitory activity of glyphaeasides is dependent on the role of side chains. Moreover, the total synthesis of glyphaeaside C revealed that its structure closely resembles that of 2,5-dideoxy-2,5-imino-D-mannitol (D-DMDP). In 2021, Byatt et al. [38] reported the multi-step facile synthesis of glyphaeaside C. The total synthesis of our target molecule initiated with the synthesis of pyrrolidine fragments from readily available starting reagent, i.e., 2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-β-D-arabinofuranose 26. The fragments were then reacted to give oxazolidinone a and b. In the next step, commonly available 1-allly-4-methoxy-benzene 28 was treated with boron tribromide followed by reaction with benzyl bromide, leading to the protection of hydroxyl group. Then, Grubb's first-generation catalyst was employed to treat pyrrolidine fragment 27 with benzyl group-Molecules 2023, 28, 2722 6 of 58 protected 4-allylphenol, leading to the synthesis of a racemic mixture of compound 29 in 66-76% yield. Compound 29 was then subjected to α and β type Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation one by one, thereby giving 30 and 31 in 87% and 90% yields, respectively. Compounds 30 and 31 were further subjected to deprotection, leading to the synthesis of four diastereomers of our target molecule. In the end, RP-HPLC was used to separate the glyphaeaside C (Scheme 5).

Moreover, englerin A is responsible for activation of protein kinase, hence regulating the glucose level [40]. Its structure is composed of seven chiral carbons along with epoxyguaine framework. Considering the significance of englerin A, various researchers have attempted to report its total synthesis. In 2020, Mou et al. [41] described an efficient synthetic route for the total synthesis of englerin A. For this purpose, 36 was oxidized in the presence of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, sodium bicarbonate and dichloromethane followed by reaction with PhSiH 3 in the presence of acetone and Co catalyst to synthesize compound 37 in 87% yield.

It is isolated from plants, and its derivatives have been found to be more active against cancer cell lines, e.g., 15-deoxygoyazensolide [43]. Considering the biologically active potential of goyazensolide, Liu et al. . [44] in 2021 reported the total synthesis of this natural product. In the first step of the total synthesis, compound 40 was reacted with Dess-Martin periodinane followed by treatment with trimethylsilylacetylene via Sonogashira coupling, which yielded compound 41 in 72% yield. Compound 41 was then subjected to Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation via (DHQD) 2 Pyr followed by protection with tert-butyldiphenylsilyl group in the presence of imidazole and dimethylaminopyridine, which gave compound 42 in 80% yield. Compound 42 then underwent a number of steps leading to the synthesis of goyazensolide 43 in 41% yield (Scheme 7). significant cytotoxic potential against cancer cells of kidney [39].

Aromatic bisabolanes belong to the class of monocyclic sesquiterpenoids, and they are obtained from different living sources such as microorganisms, plants insects, etc. [45]. Various aromatic bisabolanes have been synthesized in their respective enantiomeric forms [46]. Yajima et al. [47] in 2021 reported the total synthesis of 1,3,5-bisabolatrien-7-ol, which involved the formation of a chiral center via Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. In the first step of synthesis, compound 44 was treated with vinylmagnesium bromide followed by a reaction with methanesulfonic acid in the presence of THF and water, leading to the formation of compound 45 in 82% yield. After treatment with mercaptobenzothiazole, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was carried out, which gave chiral diol compound 47 in 98% yield. Compound 47 was further subjected to oxidation with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid followed by Smiles rearrangement, which gave compound 48 in 58% yield with er >99:1. Hydrogenation of compound 48 in the presence of platinum oxide led to the synthesis of S-Enantiomer 49 of 1,3,5-bisabolatrien-7-ol in 85% yield with an enantioselective ratio of more than 99:1. Similarly, R-Enantiomer 51 was achieved in an enantiomeric ratio of more than 99:1 by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation of compound 46 along with similar steps (Scheme 8).

Through extensive research, it has been found that the compounds isolated from the plant Phythallus engleri possess mighty anti-cancerous potential [48]. Owing to being composed of a glycolic ester attachment, englerin A is a more promising anti-cancerous agent as compared to englerin B, which indicates that this functional group is responsible for increased cytotoxic potential [49]. There have been numerous reports covering the total synthesis of englerin-A. So, in 2021, Palli et al. [50] attempted to explain the total synthesis of englerin A by starting with commercially available limonene 52. Limonene 52 was transformed into compound 53 by using a number of previously reported steps, followed by its treatment with methanesulfonamide, thus carrying out Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to give compound 54 in 80% yield with a more than 99% diastereoselectivity ratio.

Compound 54 was then subjected to protection of diol groups on treatment with 2,2-DMP and CSA followed by hydrogenation, which gave compound 55 in 82% yield. Compound 55 then underwent a number of different steps to give a mixture of oxatricyclic alcohol 56a and 56b. In the next step, compound 56 was then subjected to acylation followed by elimination in the presence of Burgess reagent to obtain compound 57 in 86% yield. Compound 57 was further used to obtain target molecule 58 in 86% yield (Scheme 9).

#### Neoclerodane Diterpene

Neoclerodane diterpene, (-)-salvinorin A is derived from Salvia divinorum, which is a medicinal plant [51]. This diterpene is used as a medicinal agent and employed as a treatment for stress, anxiety and pain. Owing to its wide medicinal importance, various research groups have reported different routes for its synthesis. Recently, in 2021, Zimdar et al. [52] devised an efficient strategy for the total synthesis of salvinorin. The total synthesis was initiated with the synthesis of lactone via a number of steps resulting in the generation of lactone 60 in 87% yield. Compound 60 was further reacted with osmium tetroxide and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide in the presence of acetone and water followed by its reaction with PIDA in the presence of dichloromethane, giving ketoaldehyde 61 in 88% yield. Compound 61 further underwent a number of steps to synthesize a racemic mixture of 62 and 63 in 44% and 14% yields, respectively, with more than 99% diastereoselectivity. Compound 61 was treated with chromium trichloride and iodoform in the presence of THF to obtain compound 64 in 58% yield. Compound 64 was then further subjected to a number of steps including Mitsunobu esterification and others to obtain compound 65 in 66% yield with 94% diastereoselectivity. Compound 65 was then subjected to Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, leading to the synthesis of diol moiety 66 in 95% yield. Finally, the last step involved treatment with acetic acid and DBAD(di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate), thereby giving salvinorin A 67 in 92% yield (Scheme 10). Through extensive research, it has been found that the compounds isolated from the plant Phythallus engleri possess mighty anti-cancerous potential [48]. Owing to being composed of a glycolic ester attachment, englerin A is a more promising anti-cancerous agent as compared to englerin B, which indicates that this functional group is responsible for increased cytotoxic potential [49]. There have been numerous reports covering the total synthesis of englerin-A. So, in 2021, Palli et al. [50] attempted to explain the total synthesis of englerin A by starting with commercially available limonene 52. Limonene 52 was transformed into compound 53 by using a number of previously reported steps, followed by its treatment with methanesulfonamide, thus carrying out Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to give compound 54 in 80% yield with a more than 99% diastereoselectivity ratio. Compound 54 was then subjected to protection of diol groups on treatment with 2,2-DMP and CSA followed by hydrogenation, which gave compound 55 in 82% yield. Compound 55 then underwent a number of different steps to give a mixture of oxatricyclic alcohol 56a and 56b. In the next step, compound 56 was then subjected to acylation followed by elimination in the presence of Burgess reagent to obtain compound 57 in 86% yield. Compound 57 was further used to obtain target molecule 58 in 86% yield (Scheme 9). 


#### Nor-Triterpenoids

Plants that are members of Schisandra genus are the source of propindilactone G and its derivatives, which constitute a family of polycyclic natural products [53]. Most members of this family are abundantly utilized in several medicines in China due to their high bioactive potency [54]. Propindilactone G along with its other derivatives are obtained from Schisandra propinqua var. propinqua, and they are structurally composed of fused cyclic rings. Owing to their frequent utilization in medicines, several research groups have devoted attention to their total synthesis. Wang et al. [55] in 2020 reported an efficient strategy for the total synthesis of propindilactone G. Total synthesis began with the Mitsunobu reaction of 68 followed by a reaction with N-bromosuccinimide and perchloric acid to prepare compound 69. It was then transformed into stable chlorohydrin, which was then joined with it to prepare compound 70 via a few steps. Compound 70 was then allowed to react with mesityl chloride in the presence of triethyl amine and tert-butanol followed by its treatment with 1,2 dimethoxyethane in the presence of DBU. It was then treated with Et 3 SiH, Co(thd) 2 in the presence of dichloroethane and oxygen, which resulted in compound 71 in high yield (75%). Starting reagent 68 was reacted via several steps, thereby giving compound 72 in 78% yield. Compound 72 was then treated with p-TSA in the presence of toluene followed by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation and treatment with HF and acetonitrile to obtain compound 73 in 96% yield. Compound 73 was converted to 74 via different steps, which then underwent Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to give the target molecule, i.e., propindilactone G 75 in 58% yield (Scheme 11).

Aromatic 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid (DMOA) is a source of many fungal monoterpenoids that constitute a variety of structures [56]. DMOA-isolated monoterpenoids, i.e., berkeyleyone and preaustinoids 1, preaustinoid 2 and preaustinoid 3, are biologically active and are highly potent against a number of inflammatory diseases [57]. (-)Berkeyleyone A structure is composed of a nonane core based on four cyclic rings. Keeping in view the medicinal importance of DMOA-derived (-)berkeyleyone A and preaustiniod 1-3, Zhang et al. [58] in 2021 described an efficient synthetic route towards their total synthesis. In this regard, 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid hydrate 76 was passed through four different steps and gave compound 77, which was subjected to reduction followed by treatment with 78 (which was obtained by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation of 85) and later on, passing through sequential Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation to obtain compound 79. Compound 79 was then subjected to Wittig olefination followed by base catalyzed acylation. Then, Krapcho-type demethylation was carried out followed by protection with trimethylsilyl group, which was then allowed to undergo Mander's reagent-catalyzed acylation. Finally, deprotection of the silyl group led to the synthesis of (-)berkeleyone A 80 in 94% yield. Berkeyleyone A underwent Dess-Martin periodinane-mediated oxidation to synthesize preaustinoid A1 81 in 88% yield, which was then treated with boron trifluoride diethyl etherate in the presence of MeCN to synthesize preaustinoid B 83 in 86% yield, which was converted to preaustinoid B2 84 by the addition of aqueous NaOH and absolute alcohol. Similarly, preaustinoid A 81 was subjected to oxidation in the presence of m-chloroperoxy benzoic acid to yield preaustinoid A1 82 in 43% yield (Scheme 12). 


#### Monoterpenoid Alcohol

The new monoterpene alcohol was first isolated from a Chinese herb, namely 'Mentha haplocalyx', by Liu and his co-researchers [59]. However, our recent studies do not correlate with their proposed structure, as it has been found to be incorrect via 13 C and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. However, its structure was found to be quite similar to that of three other naturally occurring monoterpenes, namely asiasarinol, cosmosoxide B, and cis-p-menth-3-ene-1,2,8-triol [60]. This study [61] presented the total synthesis of trans-p-menth-3-ene-1,2,8-triol. The total synthesis began with the α and β-Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, leading to the synthesis of compounds 87a and 87b in 40 and 43% yields with 33.8% and 1.2% enantiomeric excess, respectively, and similarly via route B, AD-mix-α and β leading to the synthesis of 90a and 90b in 76% and 91% yield with 54.5% ee and 59.4% enantiomeric excess, respectively. Compound 87a was further treated in the presence of methyl lithium and tetrahydrofuran followed by reaction with Dess-Martin periodinane and dichloromethane, thus finally converting to the synthesis of trans 88a (A-α) in 47% yield with 99.5% enantiomeric excess, by Luche reduction. On the other hand, other enantiomers of trans-monoterpenes were obtained by oxidation in the presence of manganese oxide followed by Luche reduction via both routes A and B. In this way, both enantiomers of the target molecule were obtained by using Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (Scheme 13). Plants that are members of Schisandra genus are the source of propindilactone G and its derivatives, which constitute a family of polycyclic natural products [53].

### Synthesis of Macrolide-Based Natural Products

Marine bugula neritina is the main source of a class of bryostatins composed of about 21 members that are known to be highly effective against cancer-causing agents. They are also responsible for neuron transmissions and also act as stimulators of protein Kinase C (PKC). Among the 21 members of this family, total synthesis of only nine bryostatins have been reported by some research groups. Bryostatin's structure is very complicated and, therefore, it is very difficult to synthesize. To date, only one report on the total synthesis of bryostatin has been published. Keeping in view their wide biological applications, Trost et al. [82]. in 2020 took this challenging task to synthesize structurally complex bryostatin 3 via a relatively efficient and short synthetic route as compared to the one reported earlier. They utilized Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, carbonylative esterification, Yamaguchi macrolactonization, epoxidation and endo-dig cyclization in their scheme. The first step of total synthesis involved the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation of 145, yielding 146 in 84% yield. Compound 146 was then treated over a number of steps to obtain compound 147 in 76% yield. Compound 147 then underwent Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation in the presence of (DHQ) 2 PHAL, which gave compound 148 in 90% yield.

Tubulysins/Amino Acid Due to developed resistance against many anti-cancerous drugs, there has been a constant urge to discover more potent anti-cancer agents [89]. Naturally occurring Tubulysins have been found to exhibit irresistible anti-cancerous activity due to their ability to interrupt tubulin division [90]. Tubulysins consist of four amino acid chains, i.e., one naturally occurring isoleucine and three other unofficial amino acids. One of them is tubuvaline (Tuv), whose facile synthesis was recently reported by Reddy et al. [91] in 2021. The key steps of this synthesis are Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation and aziridine ring opening reaction.

Vinyl-substituted compound 178 was obtained by treatment with vinyl magnesium bromide followed by addition of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. In the next step, compound 178 was subjected to Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, which led to the efficient synthesis of optically active vicinal diols 179 in 88% yield. The alcohol moieties were protected step by step with the help of TBDPSCl and MOMCl, respectively. Compound 180 over a number of steps afforded tubuvaline fragment of tubulysins 181 in 83% yield (Scheme 25).

Compounds 335 and 336 were then joined through cross-metathesis followed by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation in the presence of methane sulfonamide, leading to the synthesis of 337 in 71% yield.

Numerous natural products that are obtained or isolated from several marine species are generally long-chained, high molecular weight molecules [133]. Obvious examples are amphidinol 3 (AM3), maitotoxin (MTX) and brevisulcenal-F (KBT-F). Amphidinol 3 (AM3) was obtained from dinoflagellate Amphidium krebsii. These are known to be involved in the destruction of red blood cells and are highly effective against various fungal diseases.

Obvious examples are amphidinol 3 (AM3), maitotoxin (MTX) and brevisulcenal-F (KBT-F). Amphidinol 3 (AM3) was obtained from dinoflagellate Amphidium krebsii. These are known to be involved in the destruction of red blood cells and are highly effective against various fungal diseases. Their structural formulas consist of multiple hydroxyl and alkene groups along with cyclic rings (i.e., bistetrahydropyran). In 2020, Oishi et al. [134] took a challenging job to report the total synthesis of 25 chiral centers containing amphidinol 3 for the very first time by employing Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, cross-metathesis, Michael-Roush asymmetric crotylation and Mitsunobu reaction. Aldehyde-containing chain 343 was synthesized via coupling asymmetric reduction and cross-metathesis of iodoolefin 339, alkyne 340 and amide chain 341. Another fragment, (C21-C29) 346, was synthesized by joining acrolein 346 with terminal olefin 345 by utilizing a number of reactions including cross-metathesis and intramolecular-oxa Michael Roush asymmetric crotylation, hydroboration and Mitsunobu reaction. Furthermore, fragments 343 and 345 were combined through Julia-Kocienski olefination, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation and Nishizawa-Grieco reaction to obtain the C1-C29 fragment of amphidinol 347. Compound 347 was then joined with C32-C52 fragment 348 and C53-C67 fragment 349 through five steps, thus finally leading to the synthesis of amphidinol 3, 350 (Scheme 44).

Alzheimer's disease is one of the most dangerous disease of recent times. Drugs that inhibit the coagulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau protein phosphorylation are considered effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, as the accumulation of these substances is a causative factor for this fatal disease [135]. Despite the utmost need for anti-Alzheimer's drugs, there is a shortage of long-term, effective medicines against this disease. However, it has been discovered that 4,5-dihydroxypiperines, which are obtained from P. retrofractum, are effective against aluminum trichloride-induced dementia. Keeping in view the pharmacological aspects of 4,5-dihydroxypiperines, Luo et al. [136] in 2021 devised the total synthesis of their stereoisomers. For this purpose, piperine 351 was subjected to AD-mix-α and AD-mix-β one by one, thus producing 352 and 353 in 44.5% yields. Compounds 352 or 353 then underwent Mitsunobu reaction separately in the presence of NbzOH, triphenylphosphine and DEAD, thereby giving compounds 354 and 355 in 41.2 and 55% yields, respectively (Scheme 45).

Penostatins A and C are isolated from a marine Penicillium species, i.e., Enteromorpha intestinalis [137]. These members of the penostatin family are highly effective in the treatment of cancer, as their IC 50 values against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B have been found to be 15.87 and 0.37µM, respectively. Keeping in view the biological importance of penostatins A and C, Wang et al. [138] in 2020 reported their total synthesis. Their synthetic scheme involved the use of Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, Diels-Alder reaction and Ando-Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination as key steps. The synthesis began with the formation of 6-alkyl-3-hydroxy-2-pyrone 357 in 17.6% yield, which was treated further with tert-butyl-di-phenyl silyl chloride followed by its reaction with Grubbs II generation catalyst and toluene to obtain a racemic mixture of endo and exo adduct 359a and 359b. These two compounds were then subjected to Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to obtain a mixture of diol groups 360a and 360b in 85% yield. Compound 360b was protected via acetonide, followed by removal of silyl protecting group in the presence of HF and triethyl amine, and then subsequent reduction by using sodium borohydride and lithium hydride, affording compound 362 in 85% yield. Compound 362 was reacted via several steps, thus leading to the synthesis of penostatin A 363, which could be transformed to penostatin C 364 by dehydration in 83% yield (Scheme 46).

Most of the naturally occurring and medicinally important compounds contain optically active β-amino α-hydroxy acid functionality [139]. Similarly, the side chain of the widely known anti-cancer drug taxol contains chiral β-amino-α-hydroxy acid. Thus, various researchers have reported varied methodologies for its synthesis. Considering the vital importance of this moiety, Matsushima et al. [140] in 2021 reported the total synthesis of the taxol side chain. This side chain can be synthesized from demethoxy-4-epi-cytoxazone, which is a naturally occurring compound isolated from Streptomyces species. Cytoxazones are well known for their anti-cancer potential, as they act as cytokine inhibitors. Trichloroacetimidates were used for the incorporation of nitrogen functionality into the side chain of taxol. For this purpose, starting reagent 366 was introduced by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation followed by its reaction with DBU and trichloroacetonitrile, and then cyclization was carried out to form oxazoline ring 367 in 74% yield. Oxazoline then was reacted further via several steps, leading to the synthesis of the target molecule, i.e., taxol side chain 368 in 39% yield (Scheme 47).

The resistance of deadly strains of TB against various drugs is of great concern nowadays [141]. It has been found that thuggacins are highly potent against various bacterial diseases including tuberculosis. The structure of thuggacins consists of a thiazole ring and α,β-unsaturated macrolide, and they are obtained from mycobacterium Sorangium cellulosum. In 2021, Tomohiro et al. [142] reported the total synthesis of medicinally important thuggacin cmc-A by employing Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, Sonogashira coupling and Shiina macrolactonization. The initial stage of total synthesis involved the transformation of malic acid into 370 in 75% yield. Compound 370 was then subjected to reduction followed by Swern oxidation and Wittig olefination to obtain 371 in 90% yield. Compound 371 was then treated via several steps leading to the synthesis of compound 372 in 50% yield. Optically active oxazolidinone 373 was then made to react with NaHMDS in the presence of tetrahydrofuran and toluene followed by further treatment via a known methodology to obtain compound 374 in 97% yield. Compound 374 was then subjected to Swern oxidation followed by Wittig olefination, which resulted in the synthesis of 375 in 79% yield. Next, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was carried out followed by replacement of protecting group and reduction to obtain compound 376 in 96% yield. Compound 376 was then reacted further through a number of steps to give compound 377 in 100% yield. Finally, compounds 372 and 377 were reacted over different steps, leading to the total synthesis of thuggacin cmc-A 378 in 45% yield (Scheme 48).

These two compounds were then subjected to Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to obtain a mixture of diol groups 360a and 360b in 85% yield.
