## Appendix 1: Outbreak overview and connection to the NGSS Outbreak Overview

(A disease simulation for middle school students) Part 1. Introduction to some basic vocabulary: quarantine; microbes (virus, bacteria, fungus, parasite); names of some common diseases. Present the problem: sudden illness in New Jersey, you are commissioned to identify the cause of the disease and suggest treatment. a. Model for spread of infectious disease using base solution as an indicator of the disease. Each student gets a cup with a solution, 19 have just water and only one has the basic solution. After students mix the solution with partners we add a pH indicator into the cup to see who is infected and who is healthy. b. Test "samples" from infected patients (the problem); each pair of students tests samples from 6 patients.

Solution will turn either pink/yellow (acid/base reaction) on 6-wells plates. Since all patients were reported sick they are all infected with something. The two colors result means that 2 different agents are causing illness.

Part 3. Symptoms and Parasites: Each pair of students gets case study portfolio to analyze one case study of one of the six patients they tested. They review symptoms and find 4 common symptoms. Begin to eliminate a group of microbes (parasite, fungus, bacteria, virus) based on the symptoms presented by patients (i.e., not parasite because infected present with a fever). Students eliminate parasites as the potential microbe causing the illnesses (see microbes guide).

List of symptoms: Fever, Chills, Nausea, Vomiting, Stomach Cramping, Sore Throat, Fatigue and Diarrhea.

List of symptoms common in all cases: Fever, Nausea, Vomiting and Fatigue.

Part 4. Culturability and Viruses: Each pair of students is given their patient's simulated agar plate (glue dots on petri dish). Growth is observed. Since viruses don't grow on this media, microbes causing illnesses cannot be a virus (refer to microbes guide).

Part 5. Microbe Colonies and Fungi: Microbes guide describes characteristics of colonies on petri plate. "Colonies" (glue dots) resemble bacteria; therefore eliminate fungi. Cause of illness -two different bacteria. Part 6. Identify the bacteria causing the diseases: Utilizing a modified API ® (Analytical Profile Index) test strips, students get to analyze the result of the metabolic test (colored paper dots instead of live cultures color changed.

Once the students analyze the results they get a code for the bacteria (see Tables 2 and 3). One side of the bus has E. coli and the other side has H. pylori. This activity is very versatile since you can adjust the paper dots to identify     


## Connecting to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)

Below is a chart that highlights some of the main connections between the materials presented in "Outbreak" and the NGSS. "Outbreak" exposes students to topics in both the physical and life sciences. Activities are cited that provide students with experiences in each of the three Dimensions Metabolic API ® test strips: their development and use.

Students interpret findings and justify their recommendations based on these findings.  

## Part 2 .
2Disease transmission model and patient sample test (see figure 1 for set up):


. In this case, samples represented human patients, but the activity can be modified to represent animal populations or soil samples, etc.Part 7. Recommend Treatment: Briefly describe how antibiotics function against bacteria.Refer to case study folder for a list of effective antibiotics for each infection.List of Antibiotics: Aminoglycosides, Metronidazole, Macrolides, Penicillins, Polypeptides and Sulfona Submitted to Journal of Microbiology &

5Standard MS-LS4-6: Natural Selection and Adaptations Performance Expectation: MS-LS4-6. Use mathematical representations to support explanations of how natural selection may lead to increases and decreases of specific traits in populations over time. Dimension Outbreak Unit Connection Science and Engineering Practices -Use mathematical representations to support scientific conclusions and design solutions. (MS-LS4-6) Reading and interpreting information from graphs depicting growth curves. Disciplinary Core Idea -Traits that support successful survival and reproduction in the new environment become more common and those that do not become less common. Thus, the distribution of traits in a population changes (MS-LS4-6) Antibiotic resistance. The development of new antibiotics and targeting antibiotic function in relationship to bacterial growth and adaptation.

Crosscutting Concepts -Cause and Effect: Phenomena may have more than one cause, and some cause and effect relationships in systems can only be described using probability (MS-LS4-6).It is likely that two organisms are causing infections.Testing throughout the unit supports this and students use this information to justify their conclusions.
