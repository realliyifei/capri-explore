A Large number of tiny sensors are equipped in a network termed as Wireless Sensor Network which can be an effective tool for gathering of data from environment. Data which is collected through sensors are forwarded to the Base Station and from there to the end User. In WSN, energy efficiency is the primary factor that requires consideration. Considering this fact, clustering is introduced in WSN as it provides effective data aggregation as well as scalability for large WSNs. Moreover, clustering is also helpful in conserving limited energy resources of the sensors involved in network. In addition to this, this paper reviewed several clustering algorithms exists in WSNs. Furthermore, several challenges faced in clustering are also highlighted in this paper.
