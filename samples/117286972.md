The effect of primordial magnetic fields on X-ray or S-Z galaxy cluster survey is investigated. After recombination, the primordial magnetic fields generate additional density fluctuations. Such density fluctuations enhance the number of galaxy clusters. Taking into account the density fluctuations generated by primordial magnetic fields, we calculate the number of galaxy clusters based on the Press-Schechter formalism. Comparing with the results of Chandra X-ray galaxy cluster survey, we found that the existence of primordial magnetic fields with amplitude larger than 10 nGuass would be inconsistent. Moreover, we show that S-Z cluster surveys also have a sensitivity to constrain primordial magnetic fields. Especially SPT S-Z cluster survey has a potential to constrain the primordial magnetic fields with several nano Gauss.

# INTRODUCTION

The origin of large-scale magnetic fields observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters still remains unclear. The most widely accepted theory is the astrophysical scenario in which seed magnetic fields are generated by the battery mechanism in astrophysical phenomena and amplified by the dynamo mechanism in the interstellar or intergalactic medium (Brandenburg & Subramanian 2005). However, there is uncertainty about the efficiency of the dynamo mechanism (Kulsrud et al. 1997;Giovannini 2004). The recent studies on Faraday rotation measurements of high redshift quasars suggest the existence of the µGauss magnetic fields in high-redshift galaxies Bernet et al. 2008). The existence of such magnetic fields may also challenge the dynamo scenario.

Another candidate for the origin of the galactic magnetic fields is primordial magnetic fields which is generated in the early universe (Widrow 2002;Takahashi et al. 2005;Ichiki et al. 2006;Giovannini 2008). If primordial magnetic fields existed, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy suffer the effect of primordial magnetic fields. Therefore, the constraint on the primordial magnetic fields through BBN and CMB anisotropy has been studied by many authors.

After the recombination epoch, primordial magnetic fields generate additional density fluctuations by the Lorentz force (Wasserman 1978;Kim et al. 1996) and many authors have studied their effects on the evolution of the large scale structures; the redshift-space matter power spectrum, the epoch of reionization, and 21 cm fluctuations (Gopal & Sethi 2003;Sethi & Subramanian 2005;Tashiro & Sugiyama 2006a,b;Schleicher et al. 2009;Sethi & Subramanian 2009;Shaw & Lewis 2010). It was found that magnetic fields as small as a few nano Gauss can give strong cosmological impacts. Therefore detailed observations planned in near future have the potential to set further constraints on primordial magnetic fields.

In this paper, we study the effect of primordial magnetic fields on the mass function of galaxy clusters. The additional density fluctuations generated by the primordial magnetic fields enhance the formation of galaxy clusters. Thus, number count of clusters can constrain their amplitude as well as the standard cosmological parameters such as the amplitude of density fluctuations (σ8) and energy density of matter (Ωm). Specifically we investigate the potential of the cluster number count by X-ray observations and Sunyaev-Zel'divich (S-Z) survey.

We can find massive clusters by the observation of the X-ray emitted from the hot intracluster gas. X-ray-flux-selected cluster samples with the calibration between the X-ray temperature and the cluster mass give the mass function of galaxy clusters.  and Mantz et al. (2010) applied it to give a constraint on the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state of dark energy.

The S-Z effect is the scattering of CMB photons by the hot intracluster electron gas (Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1972) and is also a powerful tool for detecting galaxy clusters at high redshifts. Combining the S-Z galaxy survey with X-ray or optical observations, we can obtain the mass-or redshift-abundance of the number of galaxy clusters. There are many observation projects carried out or planned. In particular, Planck and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) is expected to give large catalogs of S-Z galaxy clusters and the significant constraints on cosmological parameters.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give a description of the density fluctuation generation by primordial magnetic fields after the recombination epoch. In Sec. III, we study the effect of primordial magnetic fields on the mass function by using the Press-Schechter formalism calibrated to numerical simulations. We also compare our result with the mass function derived from Chandra observations and obtain a constraint on the strength of primordial magnetic fields. In Sec. IV, we calculate the number count for S-Z galaxy cluster surveys and discuss the potential of Planck and SPT to give constraints on the primordial magnetic fields. We conclude in Sec. V. Through this paper, we assume a ΛCDM cosmological model with h = 0.72, Ωm = 0.3, Ω b = 0.05 and σ8 = 0.75.


# DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS DUE TO PRIMORDIAL MAGNETIC FIELDS

In this section, we calculate the density fluctuations produced by primordial magnetic fields. First, we make some assumptions about primordial magnetic fields. Because our interest is in relatively large length scales, we can assume that the back-reaction of the fluid velocity to magnetic fields is small. Therefore, we consider the case where primordial magnetic fields are frozen in cosmic baryon fluids,
B(t, x) = B0(x) a 2 (t) .(1)
Here B0(x) is the comoving strength of magnetic fields and a(t) is the scale factor which is normalized as a(t0) = 1 at the present time, t0. For simplicity, we assume that primordial magnetic fields are statistically homogeneous and isotropic and have the power-law spectrum with the power-law index n,
B0i(k1)B * 0j (k2) = (2π) 3 2 δ(k1 − k2) δij − k1ik2j k 2 1 PB(k), PB(k) = B 2 n k kn n ,(2)
where denotes the ensemble average, B0i(k) are Fourier components of B0i(x), kn is the wave number of an arbitrary normalized scale and Bn is the magnetic field strength at kn.

Our interest is to constrain the magnetic field strength on a certain scale in the real space. Therefore, we have to convolve the power spectrum with a Gaussian filter transformation of a comoving radius λ, in order to get the magnetic field strength in the real space (Mack et al. 2002),
B 2 λ ≡ B0i(x)B0i(x) | λ = 1 (2π) 3 d 3 kB 2 n k kn n exp − λ 2 k 2 2 2 .(3)
Substituting Eq.

(2) to Eq. (3), we can associate B λ with Bn,
B 2 λ = B 2 n (2π) 2 λ 3 (knλ) −n Γ((n + 3)/2).(4)
We take h −1 Mpc as λ throughout our paper. Before the recombination epoch, primordial magnetic fields have a damping scale due to the dissipation of the magnetic fields by the interaction between electrons and photons (Jedamzik et al. 1998;Subramanian & Barrow 1998). As a result, the magnetic field power spectrum has a sharp cutoff around the damping scale. The damping scale 1/kc after the recombination epoch can be related to the magnetic field strength B λ in the power-law magnetic field case as
kc = 143 B λ 1nG −1 h 0.7 1/2 h 2 Ω b 0.021 1/2 2/n+5 Mpc −1 ,(5)
in the matter dominated epoch. Primordial magnetic fields affect the motion of ionized baryon by the Lorentz force even after the recombination epoch (Wasserman 1978;Kim et al. 1996). Although the residual ionized baryon rate to total baryon is small after recombination, the interaction between ionized and neutral baryon is strong in redshifts considered here. Using the MHD approximation to the baryon fluid, we can write the evolution equations of density fluctuations with primordial magnetic fields as,
∂ 2 δ b ∂t 2 = −2ȧ a ∂δ b ∂t + 4πG(ρ b δ b + ρ d δ d ) + S(t, x),(6)S(t, x) = ∇ · ((∇ × B0(x)) × B0(x)) 4πρ b0 a 3 (t) ,(7)∂ 2 δ d ∂t 2 = −2ȧ a ∂δ d ∂t + 4πG(ρ b δ b + ρ d δ d ),(8)
where ρ b and ρ d are the baryon density and the dark matter density, and δ b and δ dm are the density contrast of baryon and dark matter, respectively. Solving Eqs. (6) and (8), we can obtain the power spectrum of the density fluctuations. With the assumption that there is no correlation between primordial magnetic fields and primordial density fluctuations, the density matter power spectrum can be separated into two parts as
P (k, t) = PP(k, t) + PM(k, t),(9)
where the first term PP(k) is originated from the primordial density fluctuations, whose growth rate is proportional to t 2/3 in the matter dominated epoch. The second term represents the power spectrum of the density fluctuations produced by the primordial magnetic fields. The power spectrum PM(k) is written as
PM(k) = Ω b Ωm 2 t 2 i 4πΩ b ρc0a 3 (ti) 2 DM(t) 2 I 2 (k),(10)
where ρc0 is the critical density at the present epoch, ti is the initial time which is the recombination epoch in our calculation, DM(t) is the growth rate and asymptotically proportional to t 2/3 in the matter dominated epoch (Tashiro & Sugiyama 2011), and
I 2 (k) ≡ |∇ · (∇ × B0(x)) × B0(x)| 2 .(11)
Under the assumption of the isotropic Gaussian statistics for primordial magnetic fields, we can rewrite the nonlinear convolution Eq. (11) as (Wasserman 1978;Kim et al. 1996)
I 2 (k) = dk1 dµ PB(k1)PB(|k − k1|) (4π) 2 |k − k1| 2 (2k 5 k 3 1 µ + k 4 k 4 1 (1 − 5µ 2 ) + 2k 3 k 5 1 µ 3 ),(12)
where µ is µ = k · k1/|k||k1|. Note that the range of integration of k1 in Eq. (12) depends on k because we assume that the power spectrum has a sharp cutoff below 1/kc so that k1 < kc and |k − k1| < kc must be satisfied. Eq. (12) can be estimated analytically in the limit of k/kc ≪ 1 as I 2 (k) ∼ αB 2n+10 λ k 2n+7 + βB 7 λ k 4 where α and β are coefficients which depend on n. Here we employ the fact that the damping scale kc is proportional to B −1 λ as is shown in Eq. (5). The former term dominates if n < −1.5, while the latter dominates for n > −1.5. Accordingly, if magnetic fields have a power-law index smaller than −1.5, the power-law index of density fluctuations depends on that of magnetic fields. However, if the power-law index of the magnetic fields is larger than −1.5, the power-law index of the density fluctuations is about 4 and the amplitude is decided by their damping scale.

We introduce an important scale for the evolution of density perturbations, i.e., magnetic Jeans length. Below this scale, the magnetic pressure gradients, which we do not take into account in Eq. (6), counteract the gravitational force and prevent further evolution of density fluctuations. The magnetic Jeans scale is evaluated as (Kim et al. 1996) 
kMJ = 13.8 B λ 1nG −1 h 2 Ωm 0.18 1/2 2/n+5 Mpc −1 .(13)
For simplicity, we assume that the density fluctuations do not grow below the scale, although the density fluctuations below the scale are, in fact, oscillating like the baryon oscillation.


# MASS FUNCTION AND X-RAY OBSERVATION

The additional density fluctuations produced by primordial magnetic fields enhance the number of dark matter halos. In order to estimate this enhancement, we use the mass function which is calibrated to fit the numerical simulation by Tinker et al. (2008),
dn dM = A Ωmρc0 M d ln σ −1 dM σ b −a + 1 e −c/σ 2 ,(14)
A(z) = A0 (1 + z) −0.14 , a(z) = a0 (1 + z) −0.06 , b(z) = b0 (1 + z) −α , log α(∆) = − 0.75 log(∆/75)
1.2 ,(15)
where σ is the smoothed variance of the density fluctuations with a top-hat window function, A0, a0, b0 and c depend on ∆, and ∆ is the overdensity contrast within a sphere of radius R∆ which is related to the halo mass M∆ by
M∆ = Ωm 4π 3 R 3 ∆ ρc∆.(16)
For example, in the case of the halo virial mass, ∆ is ∆ = 178 in the matter dominated epoch. Our interest is to examine the potential of the X-ray galaxy cluster observation to give constraints on primordial magnetic fields through the halo mass function. In the X-ray observation, the halo mass for high ∆ is more robust than for low ∆. Therefore, according to , we set ∆ = 500. The observational luminosity threshold gives the mass threshold for observed halos. Therefore, the number count of halos over the luminosity threshold corresponds to the integrated mass function,
N (> ML) = M L dM dn dM ,(17)
where ML is the mass threshold corresponding to the luminosity threshold. In Fig. 1, we plot the integrated number count as a function of the mass threshold for each primordial magnetic field strength with the magnetic field spectral index n = −2.8. The left panel in Fig. 1 is for the low redshift bin, z = 0.025-0.25, while the right panel is for the high redshift bin, z = 0.35-0.9. Although the additional density power spectrum induced by primordial magnetic fields dominate the primordial power spectrum on smaller scales than 1 Mpc, the additional power spectrum can enhances σ8 to 0.8 for B λ = 10 nG. For reference, we put the integrated number count for the ΛCDM model with B λ = 0 nG and σ8 = 0.85. The existence of the primordial magnetic fields lift up the mass function on small scales, because the additional density fluctuations produced by primordial magnetic fields have a blue spectrum. As a result, compared with the case with B λ = 0 nG and σ8 = 0.85, while the number count in the case with primordial magnetic fields is small on large scales, it is more enhanced on small scales.  obtained galaxy cluster mass functions at two redshift range using Chandra observation data and concluded that the obtained mass functions are in good agreement with the cosmological model with σ8 = 0.75. We compare the theoretical mass functions with the data with the error bars due to the Poisson uncertainties in Fig. 1. From this figure, we can conclude that Chandra observations rule out the primordial magnetic field strength, B λ 8 nG at roughly one-sigma.


# S-Z NUMBER COUNTS

The S-Z effect is caused by the scattering of CMB photons with electrons in hot gas in galaxy clusters. The change of the CMB intensity with the frequency ν by the S-Z effect is expressed, in the R-J limit, as (Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1972;Birkinshaw 1999)
Iν(θ) = 2ν 2 TCMBg(x)y(θ),(18)
where TCMB is the CMB temperature and g(x) is the S-Z effect spectral shape given by g(x) = x 2 e x (x/ tanh(x/2)−4)/(e x −1) 2 with x = 2πν/TCMB. The Compton y-parameter is given by the integral of the electron gas pressure along the line of sight at θ
y(θ) = dl fg Te µeme neσT ,(19)
where Te is the electron gas temperature, ne is the electron density, σT is the Thomson scattering cross-section, me is the electron mass, µe is the mean mass per electron µe = 1.143 and fg is a gas fraction in a galaxy cluster which we set fg = 0.12 (Mohr et al. 1999). In the S-Z cluster survey, it is assumed that the S-Z cluster is a point like source within the telescope beam. Therefore, we consider the total flux density from a cluster at redshift z by integrating the cluster surface,
Sν = 2ν 2 TCMBg(x) Y D 2 a ,(20)
where Da is the angular diameter distance to the cluster at z and Y is the integrated y-parameter over the cluster surface,
Y = dΩ y(θ).(21)
In order to calculate Eq. (21), we need the electron density profile in a galaxy cluster. We take the assumption that the electron density profile is isothermal β-profile (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1976),
ne(r) =    n0 1 + r 2 R 2 c − 3β 2 r < Rv 0 r ≥ Rv(22)
where Rc is the core radius of galaxy cluster which is related to the virial radius Rv with the parameter s(z) as Rc = Rv/s(z). Following Komatsu & Seljak (2002), we set
s(z) ≈ 10 1 + z M M * (0) −0.2 ,(23)
where M * (0) is a solution to σ(M ) = δc at the redshift z = 0, where δc is the critical density contrast for collapsing. Taking the assumption that the galaxy clusters are spherical and in the hydrodynamical equilibrium, we can relate the virial mass Mv with the virial radius,
Mv = 4π 3 ρM(z)∆v(z)R 3 v ,(24)
where ∆v(z) is the overdensity contrast for virialization (Nakamura & Suto 1997). We introduce the electron density weighted average temperature Te n, which is defined by Te n ≡ dlneTe/ dlne. Battye & Weller (2003) has obtained Te n under the isothermal assumption in the λCDM model,
Te n = T⋆ keV Mvir 10 15 h −1 M⊙ 2/3 ∆c(z) H(z) 2 H 2 0 1/3 1 − 2 (1 − Ωm(z)) ∆c(z) ,(25)
where T⋆ is the temperature normalization factor and they adopt T⋆ = 1.6 for agreement with numerical simulation works in Bryan & Norman (1998) and Pierpaoli et al. (2001). Using the β-profile assumption with the electron density weighted average temperature given by in Eq. (25), we can write the y-parameter as
y(θ) = Te n me fgasMvir µemp σTζ(θ),(26)
where ζ(θ) is the projected profile of the electron density,
ζ(θ) = 1 + θ 2 θ 2 c − 1 2 tan −1 s 2 −θ 2 /θ 2 c 1+θ 2 /θ 2 c 1/2 tan −1 s ,(27)
In actual observations, the finite beam size of telescopes causes the beam-smearing effect. This effect can be accounted by modifying Eq. (21) to (Bartlett 2000) Y = dΩ y(θ)B(θ).

Here we assume that the beam profile is described in a Gaussian form B(θ) = exp[−θ 2 /(2σ 2 b )] with σ b = θFWHM/ √ 8 ln 2 where θFWHM is the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM).

The parameter Y depends on the mass and the redshift of galaxy clusters. Therefore, giving the flux limit S lim of the observation, we can obtain the limit mass of galaxy clusters ML at each redshift. We show ML for Planck and SPT in Fig. 2. We present the parameter value for each observation in Table 1. Planck will cover the full sky and the Planck sensitivity is 14 mJy at 100 GHz. SPT covers ∆Ω = 4000 degree square and the SPT sensitivity is 0.8 mJy at 150 GHz. SPT has a better sensitivity than Planck. As a result, ML for SPT is lower than for Planck.

The combination between the S-Z galaxy cluster survey and the follow-up optical observation enables us to obtain the cluster number count for redshift bins. In Fig. 3, we show the number count of galaxy clusters with mass higher than the limiting mass shown in Fig. 2,  In both panels of Fig. 3, we set ∆z = 0.1 and the primordial magnetic field spectral index n = −2.8. Fig. 3 shows that the predicted number counts of Planck and SPT are almost same in low redshifts. This is because, although Planck has less sensitive to small galaxy clusters than SPT, Planck 's full sky survey area increases the number of the observed galaxy clusters, and vice versa. However, in high redshift, since the number of large-mass clusters rapidly decreases, the number count for Planck become much lower than for SPT.
∆N (z) = dn dz ∆z = ∆Ω M L dM dV dzdΩ dn dM ∆z.(29)
Primordial magnetic fields generate additional density fluctuations in small scales and bring the early structure formation. Therefore, the difference from ΛCDM cosmology due to the existence of primordial magnetic fields is emphasized in the SPT observation, especially in high redshifts. Even the primordial magnetic fields with B λ = 6 nG amplifies the number count in high redshifts by 50 % for the SPT sensitivity, while, for Planck, such primordial magnetic fields cannot bring a significant amplification.

For reference, we put the number counts for the B λ = 0 nG case with σ8 = 0.85 as the thin solid line in both panels in Fig. 3. Although σ8 in the case of B λ = 10 nG corresponds to 0.8, the power spectrum in the case of B λ = 10 nG has larger amplitudes in high ks than in the case of σ8 = 0.85 without primordial magnetic fields. This results in the fact the number of galaxy clusters with small mass is larger in the case of B λ = 10 nG than in the case of σ8 = 0.85. Therefore, the number counts for B λ = 10 nG exceed the ones for σ8 = 0.85 in the low redshifts where both Planck and SPT are sensitive to low mass clusters as shown Fig. 2. In particular, the number counts of SPT for B λ = 10nG is almost same as for σ8 = 0.85 even in high redshifts, because SPT has small limiting mass.


# CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have studied the effect of primordial magnetic fields on the galaxy survey by X-ray and S-Z observation. The primordial magnetic fields generate additional density fluctuations which has a blue power spectrum. Therefore, the number of galaxy clusters, especially small ones, is enhanced. X-ray and S-Z survey can directly observe this enhancement. Nano-Gauss primordial magnetic fields bring observable enhancement of the number count by the order of factors.

For X-ray cluster surveys, we have used Chandra's result to put a constraint on the amplitude of primordial magnetic fields. We have found that Chandra's result rules out the existence of primordial magnetic fields with B λ 10 nG at roughly one-sigma level.  Figure 3. The integrated number counts of S-Z galaxy clusters. The left panel is for Planck, and the right panels is for SPT. In both panels, the solid, the dashed, the dashed-dotted and the dotted lines represent the number counts for the case of B λ = 10 nG, B λ = 8 nG, B λ = 6 nG and B λ = 0 nG, respectively. For comparison, we put the number counts for the B λ = 0 nG case with σ 8 = 0.85 as the thin solid line.

S-Z cluster surveys also have a sensitivity to constrain primordial magnetic fields. Especially the observation like SPT which has small limiting mass with 1 arcmin angular resolution is a good probe of primordial magnetic fields. We have found that the combination with high redshift optical surveys has the potential to put the constraint on the fields of nano Gauss order.

In this paper, we consider only primordial magnetic fields with n = −2.8. The power spectrum of the density fluctuations generated by primordial magnetic fields has a dependence on the spectral index of the primordial magnetic fields. The large spectral index induces the large amplification of the density fluctuations on small scales and increases the mass function for small-mass clusters. For example, B λ = 4 nG and n = −2.5 amplifies the number count in high redshifts by 50 % for the SPT sensitivity, comparing with the number count without primordial magnetic fields. This amplification is same as in the case of B λ = 6 nG with n = −2.5. Therefore, SPT has the potential to put the strong constraint on the primordial magnetic fields with large n.

In our calculation, we ignore the effect of primordial magnetic field on the structure of a halo. However, in order to obtain a highly accurate constraint on primordial magnetic fields, it is necessary to study the modification on the electron density profile and the relation between the X-ray temperature and the cluster mass by primordial magnetic fields. For example, Zhang (2004) and Gopal & Roychowdhury (2010) pointed out that magnetic fields with several µGauss in a halo modify the electron density profile and this modification change the S-Z effect signal. The adiabatic contraction in the halo formation easily amplifies the order of nano Gauss of primordial magnetic field strength to the order of µ Gauss. Taking into account such effects, we will study the constraint on primordial magnetic fields through X-ray and S-Z surveys in the future.
