Hard X-ray (≥ 10 keV) observations of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can shed light on some of the most obscured episodes of accretion onto supermassive black holes. The 70-month Swift/BAT all-sky survey, which probes the 14-195 keV energy range, has currently detected 838 AGN. We report here on the broad-band X-ray (0.3-150 keV) characteristics of these AGN, obtained by combining XMM-Newton, Swift/XRT, ASCA, Chandra, and Suzaku observations in the soft X-ray band (≤ 10 keV) with 70-month averaged Swift/BAT data. The non-blazar AGN of our sample are almost equally divided into unobscured (N H < 10 22 cm −2 ) and obscured (N H ≥ 10 22 cm −2 ) AGN, and their Swift/BAT continuum is systematically steeper than the 0.3-10 keV emission, which suggests that the presence of a high-energy cutoff is almost ubiquitous. We discuss the main X-ray spectral parameters obtained, such as the photon index, the reflection parameter, the energy of the cutoff, neutral and ionized absorbers, and the soft excess for both obscured and unobscured AGN.

## INTRODUCTION

Active Galactic Nuclei 24 (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the Universe, and are believed to play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies (e.g., Kormendy & Richstone 1995;Ferrarese & Merritt 2000;Gebhardt et al. 2000;Tremaine et al. 2002;Schawinski et al. 2006;Kormendy & Ho 2013). One of the most distinctive features of AGN is their strong emission in the X-ray regime, which is produced by Comptonization of optical and UV photons (e.g., Haardt & Maraschi 1991) in a hot plasma located very close to the accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH). X-ray emission is therefore an important tracer of the physical properties of the accreting system, and can constrain the amount of matter along the line of sight, typically parameterized as the neutral hydrogen column density (N H ). X-ray emission can also be used to shed light on the structure of the circumnuclear material, by studying the spectral features created by the reprocessing of the primary X-ray radiation on the material surrounding the SMBH. The two main features produced by reprocessing of X-ray radiation in neutral material are the iron Kα line at 6.4 keV and a broad Compton "hump" peaking at ∼ 30 keV (e.g., Matt et al. 1991, Murphy & Yaqoob 2009).

The integrated emission of unresolved AGN gives rises to the Cosmic X-ray background (CXB; e.g., Giacconi et al. 1962;Bauer et al. 2004;Harrison et al. 2016). Studies carried out below 10 keV have shown that the shape of the CXB is significantly flatter (with a photon index Γ ∼ 1.4, e.g., De Luca & Molendi 2004) than the typical X-ray spectrum of unobscured AGN (Γ ≃ 1.9, e.g., Nandra & Pounds 1994). This, together with the fact that the CXB shows a clear peak at ∼ 30 keV, where the bulk of the reprocessed X-ray radiation is emitted, suggests that heavily obscured AGN contribute significantly to the CXB. Synthesis models of the CXB (e.g., Ueda et al. 2003, Gilli et al. 2007, Treister & Urry 2005Treister et al. 2009, Draper & Ballantyne 2010, Akylas et al. 2012) have shown that a fraction of 10−30% of Compton-thick [CT, log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 24] AGN are needed to reproduce the CXB. The fraction of CT AGN inferred from synthesis models of the CXB is, however, strongly dependent on the assumptions made on the fraction of reprocessed X-ray emission, with stronger reflection components resulting in smaller fractions of CT AGN (e.g., Gandhi et al. 2007;Treister et al. 2009;Ricci et al. 2011;Vasudevan et al. 2013bVasudevan et al. , 2016Ueda et al. 2014).

Radiation at hard X-rays (E 10 keV) is less affected by the obscuring material, at least up to N H ∼ 10 23.5 − 10 24 cm −2 (see Figure 1 of Ricci et al. 2015), due to the decline of the photoelectric cross-section with increasing energy. Hard X-ray observations are therefore very well suited to detect heavily obscured AGN, and allow us to obtain the least biased X-ray sample of local AGN, and to directly study the X-ray emission responsible for the peak of the CXB. Currently, there are four operating hard X-ray observatories in-orbit. IBIS/ISGRI on board INTEGRAL (Winkler et al. 2003) was launched in 2002, and has detected so far more than 200 AGN (Beckmann et al. 2006(Beckmann et al. , 2009Paltani et al. 2008;Panessa et al. 2008;de Rosa et al. 2008de Rosa et al. , 2012Ricci et al. 2011;Malizia et al. 2012;Bottacini et al. 2012). NuSTAR (Harrison et al. 2013), launched in 2012, is the first focussing hard X-ray telescope on-orbit, and its serendipitous survey has detected 497 sources in the first 40 months of observations (Lansbury et al. 2017b, see also Chen et al. 2017). Thanks to its revolutionary characteristics, NuSTAR has been very efficient in constraining the properties of heavily obscured AGN (e.g., Baloković et al. 2014;Gandhi et al. 2014;Stern et al. 2014;Koss et al. 2015Koss et al. , 2016bBrightman et al. 2015;Lansbury et al. 2015Lansbury et al. , 2017aAnnuar et al. 2015Annuar et al. , 2017Boorman et al. 2016;Ricci et al. 2016aRicci et al. ,b, 2017a. The recently launched mission AstroSat (Singh et al. 2014) carries on board two hard X-ray instruments: the Large Area Xenon Proportional Counters (LAXPC; 3-80 keV) and the Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride coded-mask imager (CZTI,. Finally, the NASA mission Swift (Gehrels et al. 2004), launched in 2005, carries on board the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT, Barthelmy et al. 2005;Krimm et al. 2013). BAT is a hard X-ray detector that operates in the 14-195 keV energy range and has proved to be an extremely valuable tool for studying AGN in the local Universe, since it is the only hard X-ray instrument to continuously survey the whole sky.

Early studies of Swift/BAT AGN (e.g., Tueller et al. 2008;Ajello et al. 2008;Winter et al. 2008Winter et al. , 2009aBurlon et al. 2011;Ajello et al. 2012) were focussed on the first releases of the Swift/BAT catalog (Markwardt et al. 2005;Tueller et al. 2010;Segreto et al. 2010;Cusumano et al. 2010a,b) or on relatively small subsamples (e.g., Vasudevan et al. 2013a). The latest release of the Swift/BAT catalog (70-month, Baumgartner et al. 2013) has however considerably increased the number of hard X-ray selected AGN, detecting more than 800 extragalactic sources. The all-sky coverage of Swift/BAT allows to detect very luminous and rare sources, and, being one of the least biased samples of AGN available, it allows to study a growing number of local heavily obscured AGN. A large number of works have already been carried out studying pointed X-ray observations (e.g., Winter et al. 2009b;Ricci et al. 2010;Tazaki et al. 2011Tazaki et al. , 2013Kawamuro et al. 2016b;Tanimoto et al. 2016;Marchesi et al. 2017;Oda et al. 2017) and the multiwavelength properties of Swift/BAT AGN. This includes radio (e.g., Burlon et al. 2013;Wong et al. 2016), far-IR (e.g., Meléndez et al. 2014;Mushotzky et al. 2014;Shimizu et al. 2015Shimizu et al. , 2016, mid-IR (e.g., Meléndez et al. 2008;Weaver et al. 2010;Ichikawa et al. 2012Ichikawa et al. , 2017, near-IR (e.g., Mushotzky et al. 2008;Lamperti et al. 2017;Onori et al. 2017a,b;Ricci et al. 2017d), optical (e.g., Vasudevan et al. 2009;Koss et al. 2010;Winter et al. 2010;Ueda et al. 2015) and γ-ray (e.g., Sambruna et al. 2010;Teng et al. 2011) studies, as well as works focussed on the host galaxy properties (e.g., Koss et al. 2011a), variability (e.g., Shimizu & Mushotzky 2013;Soldi et al. 2014) and on peculiar sources (e.g., Koss et al. 2012;Hogg et al. 2012;Smith et al. 2014;Schawinski et al. 2015). Moreover, NuSTAR has been observing Swift/BAT AGN since its launch in the framework of a legacy survey (Baloković et al. in prep.), providing high-quality data in the 3-80 keV energy range.

Our group has been working on a systematic study of the multi-wavelength properties of a very large number of Swift/BAT selected AGN from the currently available 70-month catalog ) and a forthcoming extension (105 months, Oh et al. 2017a). A large effort has been made to collect optical spectroscopy for most of the sources reported in the 70-month Swift/BAT catalog, which allowed to infer black hole masses for both obscured and unobscured objects ). The first results of the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopical Survey (BASS 25 ) include the study of the CT AGN detected by BAT , see also Koss et al. 2016a andAkylas et al. 2016), the analysis of the correlation between high-ionisation optical emission lines and AGN Xray emission , the study of the relationship between optical narrow emission lines and the physical parameters of the accreting SMBH (Oh et al. 2017b), a near-IR spectroscopic study (Lamperti et al. 2017), and the analysis of the relationship between the X-ray photon index and the mass-normalized accretion rate . The detailed multiwavelength analysis of a large sample of local AGN 26 will be a very important benchmark for studies of AGN at higher redshifts, where the typical fluxes are significantly lower.

In this paper we present a compilation and analysis of the X-ray data available for the AGN of the 70-month Swift/BAT catalog. This paper is structured as follows. In §2 we present our sample, in §3 we describe the data 4 Ricci et al. analysis of the soft X-ray data, while in §4 we illustrate the procedure adopted for the broad-band X-ray spectral analysis of the sources, and the models used. In §5.1 we discuss the luminosity and flux distributions of our sample, in §5.2 we examine the characteristics of the Xray continuum, in §5.3 we report on the results obtained for the neutral and ionized absorbing material, while in §5.4 we discuss about the properties of the soft excess of obscured and unobscured AGN. Finally, in §6 we summarize our findings and present our conclusions. Throughout the paper we adopt standard cosmological parameters (H 0 = 70 km s −1 Mpc −1 , Ω m = 0.3, Ω Λ = 0.7). Unless otherwise stated, uncertainties are quoted at the 90% confidence level.


## SAMPLE

Our sample consists of the 838 AGN detected within the 70-month Swift/BAT catalog 27 (Baumgartner et al. 2013, Fig. 1). We flagged all blazars in our sample according to the latest release (5.0.0, Massaro et al. 2015) of the Roma BZCAT 28 catalog (Massaro et al. 2009), and using the results of recent works on BAT detected blazars (Ajello et al. 2009;Maselli et al. 2013). Overall 105 objects are classified as blazars. Of these 26 are BL Lacs (BZB), 53 are Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (BZQ) and 26 are of uncertain type (BZU). This is a different terminology than that used in the optical catalog of Koss et al. (2017) which refers to these sources as beamed AGN. Several sources have been identified as possible blazars by Koss et al. (2017) using optical spectroscopy, and are not treated as blazars here. In Table C1 we report the list of sources in our sample, together with their counterparts, coordinates, redshifts and blazar classification. For completeness, we also report the results obtained for the only non-AGN extragalactic source detected by Swift/BAT, M 82 (a nearby starburst with X-ray emission produced by star formation, e.g., Ranalli et al. 2008), although we do not include it in our statistical analysis.


### Counterpart identification

The counterparts of the Swift/BAT sources were mostly taken from Baumgartner et al. (2013) and from recent follow-up studies (e.g., Parisi et al. 2009;Masetti et al. 2010b;Lutovinov et al. 2012;Masetti et al. 2012;Parisi et al. 2012). In order to confirm the counterpart association, for all sources we studied the 2-10 keV images of the fields using XMM-Newton/EPIC, Swift/XRT and Chandra/ACIS (we provide additional information on these data-sets in §3).

Furthermore, the object coordinates were cross-checked with the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, Skrutskie et al. 2006) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, Wright et al. 2010) point source catalogs, and deviations larger than 3 ′′ were investigated individually. In 27 cases, the coordinates of the associated counterparts in the original BAT catalog do not accurately point to the nuclei of the systems, which in all cases are identified with a relatively bright WISE and 2MASS source. In further five cases the situation is more complex, because the original counterpart does not Spectroscopic redshifts are available for most of the sources of our sample (803, i.e. ∼ 96%). The redshifts were taken from the first release (DR1) of the BASS optical catalog ) and from the literature. For the closest objects in our sample (at z < 0.01), whenever available, we used redshift-independent measurements of the distance, using the mean reported in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). Redshiftindependent distances were considered for 44 objects.

The redshift and distance distribution of the nonblazar AGN (left panels) and the blazars (right panels) in our sample are presented in Fig. 2, respectively. The median redshift and distance of non-blazar AGN (z = 0.0367, D = 161.6 Mpc) is significantly lower than that of blazars (z = 0.302, D = 1565 Mpc), consistent with the very different luminosity distributions of these two classes of objects (see §5.1 and Fig. 14). Fig. 3 presents the observed 14-195 keV Swift/BAT luminosity versus redshift for unobscured (N H < 10 22 cm −2 ), obscured [10 22 ≤ (N H /cm −2 ) < 10 24 ], CT (N H ≥ 10 24 cm −2 ) AGN and blazars in the sample.


#### Photometric redshifts

The Swift/BAT 70-month sample includes 28 nonblazar AGN and 7 blazars with no redshift measurement. For the sub-sample of non-blazar AGN we calculated photometric redshifts using the LePHARE 29 code (Arnouts et al. 1999;Ilbert et al. 2006), which is a Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code based on χ 2 minimization. We adopted a set of templates from Salvato et al. (2009Salvato et al. ( , 2011, which includes some AGN models from Polletta et al. (2007) and hybrid templates combining AGN and host-galaxy emission. This library has been optimized and extensively tested for SED-fitting of AGN-dominated sources (see Salvato et al. 2009 for further details). Dust extinction was added to each template as a free parameter in the fit, by assuming the Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation law.

To perform the SED-fitting, we collected multiwavelength photometry in the ultraviolet, optical and infrared regimes. We made use of the publicly available data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX, Martin et al. 2005) in the far-ultraviolet (λ ∼ 1550Å); the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS-DR10, Ahn et al. 2014) in the optical (u, g, r, i and z bands); the 2MASS catalog in the near-infrared (J, H and K s bands); the WISE and AKARI catalogues in the mid-infrared (λ ∼ 3.4, 4.6, 12, 18 and 22 µm); the Infra-Red Astronomical Satellite (IRAS, Neugebauer et al. 1984) in the far-infrared (λ ∼ 60 and 100 µm). We collected broad-band photometry for 27 out of the 28 sources without a listed redshift 30 .

The LePHARE code also builds a probability distribution function (PDF) through the comparison of the observed SED with all the models in the library. This allows us to quantify the uncertainty of the resulting photometric redshift. We finally note that, since they represent a very small fraction (∼ 4%) of our sample, sources with photometric redshifts were only listed out of completeness, and were not used for any study which used the X-ray luminosity.


## X-RAY DATA AND DATA ANALYSIS

The spectral analysis was carried out combining the 70-month time-averaged Swift/BAT spectra with data obtained by several X-ray facilities: ASCA ( §3.1), Chandra ( §3.2), Suzaku ( §3.3), Swift/XRT ( §3.4), and XMM-Newton ( §3.5). Only two AGN (SWIFT J1119.5+5132 and SWIFT J1313.6+3650A) were not observed by any X-ray facility in the 0.3-10 keV range, implying a completeness rate of ∼ 99.8%. The highest energy bin (i.e., . Facilities and instruments used for the analysis of the soft X-ray spectra (see Table 1).

150-195 keV) of the Swift/BAT spectrum was not used due to its poor response, such that it has a signal-tonoise ratio a factor of ∼ 100 − 1000 lower than the other seven BAT energy bins (Koss et al. 2013, see top panel of Fig. 2 of their paper).

The core of our analysis is the spectral decomposition of all the X-ray data available for the Swift/BAT AGN, to provide measurements of key physical properties related to the X-ray emission, including the intrinsic X-ray luminosity and the column density of matter along the line-of-sight. Therefore we first checked the results obtained by fitting the Swift/XRT spectrum with a power-law model (see §4), visually inspecting the resulting best-fit models and the residuals. We then used X-ray data from Swift/XRT for the spectral analysis of unobscured sources, unless: i) we found evidence of ionized absorption or peculiar features; ii) Swift/XRT data had low signal-to-noise ratio or were not available. For these objects we used XMM-Newton EPIC/PN data, or if no XMM-Newton observation was publicly available Suzaku/XIS, Chandra/ACIS or ASCA SIS0/SIS1 and GIS2/GIS3 data were used. For obscured sources we used XMM-Newton EPIC/PN, Suzaku/XIS, Chandra/ACIS or ASCA SIS0/SIS1 and GIS2/GIS3 data. In case none of those were available we used Swift/XRT observations. For blazars we used Swift/XRT data, unless none were available. Whenever more than one observation was available, we used the deepest (after accounting for data filtering). We privileged XMM-Newton EPIC/PN observations over Suzaku/XIS, Chandra/ACIS, and ASCA SIS0/SIS1 and GIS2/GIS3 because of its larger collecting area in the 0.3-10 keV region, and due to the fact that XMM-Newton observed a larger number of sources compared to the other satellites. In one case (SWIFT J2234.8-2542) the source was only observed by BeppoSAX below 10 keV, and we report the results of study of Malizia et al. (2000) combined with the analysis of the Swift/BAT spectrum.

In the following we briefly describe the X-ray instruments we used, and the procedure we adopted, for the spectral extraction. Details of the soft X-ray observation used for the broad-band X-ray spectral analysis of each source are reported in Table C2. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of different instruments used for the analysis of the soft X-ray emission of Swift/BAT AGN (see also  Table 1).

3.1. ASCA Figure 5. Distribution of the ≤ 10 keV counts for the AGN of our sample with soft X-ray observations available. The vertical dot-dashed line shows the threshold used to separate objects fitted with Cash (< 200 counts) and χ 2 (≥ 200 counts) statistics (see §4 for details). The counts from different instruments were summed for observations carried out but Suzaku/XIS and ASCA GIS/SIS. The median of the number of counts of our sample is ∼ 1, 600.

We used ASCA SIS0/SIS1 and GIS2/GIS3 data for three sources. The reduced spectra were obtained from the Tartarus database 31 (Turner et al. 2001), which collects the products obtained for 611 ASCA observations of AGN.


### Chandra

Chandra (Weisskopf et al. 2000) ACIS (Garmire et al. 2003) data were used for 14 sources. The reduction of Chandra/ACIS data was performed using CIAO v.4.6 (Fruscione et al. 2006) following the standard procedures. The data were first reprocessed using chandra repro, and the source spectra were then extracted using circular apertures of 10 ′′ radius, centered on the optical counterpart of each source. Background spectra were extracted using circular regions with identical apertures, centered on regions where no other source was present. Both spectra were extracted using the specextract tool. Sources with significant pileup were modelled with the addition of the pileup model in xspec.


### Suzaku

Suzaku (Mitsuda et al. 2007) X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS, Koyama et al. 2007) data were used to complement Swift/BAT spectra for ten source. For most of its operating time XIS was composed of three cameras, the front-illuminated (FI) XIS 0 and XIS 3, and the backilluminated (BI) XIS 1 (hereafter BI-XIS).

For each of the three XIS cameras, we reprocessed the data and extracted the spectra from the cleaned event files using a circular aperture with a radius of 1.7 ′ centred on the source. The background was taken from a sourcefree annulus centred at the source peak, with an internal and external radius of 3.5 ′ and 5.7 ′ , respectively. We generated the ancillary response matrices (ARFs) and the detector response matrices (RMFs) using the xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen tasks (Ishisaki et al. 2007), respectively. The spectra obtained by XIS 0 and XIS 3 were merged using mathpha, addrmf and addarf. 31 http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/asca/data/tartarus/ 3.4. Swift/XRT The X-ray telescope (XRT, Burrows et al. 2005) on board Swift followed up nearly all of the sources detected by BAT in the first 70-months of operations. Swift/XRT data analysis was performed using the xrtpipeline following the standard guidelines ). Swift/XRT observations were used for a total of 588 sources.


### XMM-Newton

We used XMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) EPIC/PN (Strüder et al. 2001) observations for 220 sources. The original data files were reduced using the XMM-Newton Standard Analysis Software version 12.0.1 (Gabriel et al. 2004), and the raw PN data files were then processed using the epchain task.

For every observation, we inspected the background light curve in the 10-12 keV energy band, in order to filter the exposures for periods of high-background activity. Only patterns corresponding to single and double events (PATTERN ≤ 4) were selected. We extracted the source spectra from the final filtered event list using circular apertures centred on the object, with a typical radius of 20 ′′ . Regions with smaller radii were used for the sources detected with a low signal-to-noise ratio. The background was extracted from circular regions of 40 ′′ radius, located on the same CCD as the source, where no other X-ray source was detected. We checked for the presence of pile-up using the epatplot task. For observations with significant pile-up we used an annular region with an inner radius set such that no pile-up was present. Finally, we created ARFs and RMFs using the arfgen and rmfgen tasks, respectively.


## X-RAY SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

The X-ray spectral analysis was carried out using xspec v.12.7.1b (Arnaud 1996). For all models reported in what follows, we took into account Galactic absorption in the direction of the source, by adding photoelectric absorption (i.e., using the tbabs component in xspec, Wilms et al. 2000), fixed to the value from the HI maps of Kalberla et al. (2005), assuming Solar metallicity. The combined X-ray spectra were then analyzed using a series of models of successive complexity, which are listed in Table 2. First, all sources were fitted using a simple power-law model [tbabs Gal ·(zpow) in xspec], and the residuals were then visually inspected to assess whether the X-ray spectrum showed signatures of neutral or ionized absorption. A cross-calibration constant (C BAT ) was added to all models to take into account possible variability between the 70-month averaged Swift/BAT spectra and the considerably shorter soft X-ray observations, as well as cross-calibration uncertainties. It should be remarked that this factor does not take into account possible spectral variability between the hard and soft X-ray spectra, which might accompany flux variability.

Sources were divided into two main categories depending on their BZCAT classification: non-blazar AGN ( §4.2.1 and §4.2.2) and blazars ( §4.2.3). The spectra of eight sources originally classified as blazars show signatures of reprocessed X-ray emission, or are heavily contaminated by other components, and were therefore fitted using non-blazar models. These sources are ratio between χ 2 (or C-stat) and the DOF versus the number of counts. In both panels the red dashed line represents χ 2 /DOF=1 or C-Stat/DOF=1. 3C 120 (Kataoka et al. 2007), 3C 273 (Haardt et al. 1998, Soldi et al. 2008, Cen A (Evans et al. 2004), Mrk 348 (Marchese et al. 2014), NGC 1052 ) and NGC 7213 (Bianchi et al. 2008b). Besides these sources, the X-ray spectrum of Mrk 1501 also shows evidence of reprocessed X-ray radiation, in the form of a Fe Kα feature. NGC 1275 was also fitted using a different model, since its X-ray spectrum shows peculiar features due to the fact that the source is located at the center of the Perseus cluster. Non-blazar AGN were then further divided, based on the initial power-law fit, into two categories: those showing relatively weak intrinsic absorption from neutral material ( §4.2.1) and those showing clear signatures of obscuration ( §4.2.2). Different sets of models were used for sources in different categories. In all cases we started with the simplest models and, after visual inspection of the residuals, we increased their complexity, adding components if the fit was significantly improved.

We used χ 2 statistics to fit the soft X-ray spectra when the number of counts was ≥ 200, and Cash statistics (Cstat, Cash 1979) when it was below 200. For the 692 sources for which more than 200 source counts were available, we rebinned the spectral data to have 20 counts per bin and used χ 2 statistics. For the remaining 144 objects we rebinned the soft X-ray spectra to have one count per bin and adopted Cash statistics, while we still used χ 2 Overall 26 spectral models were used to fit the broad-band X-ray spectra of the AGN in the 70-month Swift/BAT catalog. The different components used in the models are listed in Table 2, and the models are illustrated in Figs. 8-11 (with the exception of models D1 and D2, see §4.2.4).

statistics for the Swift/BAT spectra. The median number of counts across the entire sample is 1,600. Fig. 5 presents the distribution of counts below 10 keV. Fits were considered to be significantly improved by the addition of a component if ∆χ 2 > 2.71 (or ∆C−stat 2 > 2.71) for each extra free parameter.

Note. -The table lists the different components that were used by the models, and the number of sources for which each model was adopted. When more than one checkmark is reported, the component was used more than once. scatt is the scattered component (f scat ×cutoffpl in xspec), while C BAT is the cross-calibration constant (cons in xspec). Details about the spectral components can be found in §4.1, while the accurate syntax used in xspec is reported in §4.2.1-4.2.3. a The reflection parameter was set to be R ≥ 0, i.e. the component takes into account the primary X-ray emission (in the form of a cutoff power-law) and reprocessed radiation at the same time. b The reflection parameter was set to be negative, i.e. the reflection component is disconnected from the primary X-ray emission and assumed to be unobscured. c Absorption by neutral material was considered for the thermal component.  . Models used for the X-ray spectral analysis (A1 to A6). In the models A1 to A6 the reflection and primary components were decoupled in pexrav for the purpose of visual clarity. See Table 2 and §4.2 for details.  . Models used for the X-ray spectral analysis (A7 to B4). In model A7 and A8 the reflection and primary components were decoupled in pexrav for the purpose of visual clarity. See Table 2 and §4.2 for details.  Figure 10. Models used for the X-ray spectral analysis (B5 to C1). See Table 2 and §4.2 for details.  . Models used for the X-ray spectral analysis (C2 to C7). See Table 2 and §4.2 for details.

In the next sections, we report in detail the spectral components ( §4.1) and the models ( §4.2.1, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3) we used for the broad-band X-ray spectral fitting. The histograms showing the number of times each bestfit model was used are illustrated in Fig. 7 for unobscured AGN (top panel), obscured AGN (middle panel), and blazars (bottom panel). The main spectral parameters obtained by the broad-band X-ray spectral fitting are reported in Table C3. In the top panel of Fig. 6 we show the values of the χ 2 /C-stat obtained with the best-fit model versus the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) for the sources in our sample, while in the bottom panel we show the ratio between χ 2 (or C-stat) and the DOF versus the number of counts. The median value of the ratio between χ 2 and the DOF is 0.996 ± 0.008, confirming the satisfactory quality of the spectral fitting.


### Model components

In the following we describe the different components used for the X-ray spectral fitting and the free parameters of each model.


#### X-ray continuum

For the X-ray continuum of the non-blazar AGN we used a power-law component with a high-energy cutoff (cutoffpl in xspec). The free parameters of this model are the photon index (Γ), the energy of the cutoff (E C ) and the normalization (no cut ). To take into account reprocessing of the primary X-ray continuum by circumnuclear material we used the pexrav model (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995), which assumes reflection by a semi-infinite slab. The inclination angle i was fixed to 30 degrees for all objects, in order to have a value of the reflection parameter (R = Ω/2π, where Ω is the covering factor of the reflecting material) independent of any assumption on the geometry of obscured and unobscured AGN. The metallicity was fixed to solar, and thus the sole free parameter of this model is R. For blazars we used a simple power-law model (pow) or, when required by the fit, a broken (bkn) or a double-broken (bkn2) power-law. For the power-law model the free parameters are the photon index (Γ) and the normalization (no pow ). The broken power-law model considers a continuum that changes its slope at an energy E brk . The two different photon indices are Γ 1 and Γ 2 for E < E brk and E > E brk , respectively. The free parameters of this model are E brk , Γ 1 , Γ 2 and the normalization (no bkn ). In the double broken power-law model the continuum changes slope twice: at E 1 brk and E 2 brk . The photon indices are Γ 1 , Γ 2 and Γ 3 for E < E 1 brk , E 1 brk ≤ E < E 2 brk and E ≥ E 2 brk , respectively. The free parameters are E 1 brk , E 2 brk , Γ 1 , Γ 2 , Γ 3 and the normalization (no bkn2 ). No reflection component was considered for blazars, since most of the X-ray emission arises from the jets, which washes out any signature of reprocessed radiation. In Table C3 we report the values of Γ 1 for the blazars for which a broken power-law continuum was used, while the values of Γ 2 , Γ 3 , E 1 brk and E 2 brk are reported in Table C4.


#### Absorption

Absorption of the X-ray radiation by neutral material occurs due to the combined effect of photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering. Photoelectric absorption was taken into account using the zphabs model, with the redshift fixed to the systemic redshift of each source. Compton scattering was considered using the cabs model. The only free parameter for these two models is the column density, which was tied to have the same value in all fits [i.e., N H (cabs)=N H (zphabs)=N H ]. Whenever the column density could not be constrained because the source was completely unobscured, it was fixed to N H /cm −2 = 0. The redshift was fixed to z = 0 for the sources for which no spectroscopic redshift was available. When required by the data we used a partial covering neutral absorber model zpcfabs, whose free parameters are N H and the covering fraction (f cov ). The values of N H from the best-fit models are listed in Table C3 Absorption by ionized gas (also referred to as "warm absorption") was taken into account using the zxipcf model (Reeves et al. 2008), which uses a grid of XSTAR absorption models . The free parameters of this model are the column density (N W H ), the ionization parameter (ξ) and the covering factor (f W cov ) of the warm absorber. The ionisation parameter is defined as ξ = L ion /nr 2 , where n is the density of the absorber, L ion is the ionizing luminosity of the source in the range 5 eV-300 keV, and r is the distance between the ionizing source and the absorbing material. The values of N W H , ξ and f W cov obtained by our spectral analysis are listed in Table C5.


#### Soft excess

An excess over the X-ray primary emission below ∼ 1 − 2 keV (the "soft excess") has been found in both obscured and unobscured sources, although it is widely believed to have a very different physical origin in the two cases. For unobscured objects the soft excess might be due to any of three potential mechanisms: i) blurred relativistic reflection (e.g., Crummy et al. 2006;Fabian et al. 2009;Vasudevan et al. 2014); ii) Comptonization of the seed optical/UV photons in plasma colder than that responsible for the primary X-ray component (e.g., Mehdipour et al. 2011;Done et al. 2012;Boissay et al. 2014Boissay et al. , 2016; iii) smeared absorption by ionized material (e.g., Gierliński & Done 2004). For obscured objects this feature could have one or several of the following origins: i) emission from a thermal plasma possibly related to star formation (e.g., Iwasawa et al. 2011); ii) radiative-recombination continuum created by gas photoionized by the AGN (e.g., Bianchi et al. 2006;; iii) scattering of the primary X-ray emission in Compton-thin circumnuclear material (e.g., Ueda et al. 2007).

Given the different physical origin, we adopted different models to reproduce the soft excess in unobscured and obscured AGN. For unobscured sources we used a blackbody component (bbody), with the free parameters being the temperature (kT bb ) and the normalization. This is not a physical model, and it provides only a phenomenological representation of this feature; given the uncertain origin of the soft excess we deem this to be the best approach. For obscured AGN a second cutoff power-law component was added to the model, with the values of the photon index, the cutoff energy and the normalizations fixed to those of the primary X-ray emission. A multiplicative constant (f scatt ), of typically a few percents of the primary X-ray emission ( §5.4.2), was added to this second cutoff power-law to renormalise the flux, as a free parameter. For obscured sources we also added, when necessary, a collisionally ionized plasma (apec). The free parameters of the apec model are the temperature (kT therm. ) and the normalization. It should be noted that an unobscured scattered component could also be due to a partially covering absorber, in particular for values of f scatt ≥ 5 − 10%.


#### Fe Kα emission lines

The fluorescent iron Kα emission line has been observed almost ubiquitously in the X-ray spectra of AGN (e.g., Mushotzky et al. 1993;Shu et al. 2010), and is composed of a narrow (e.g., Shu et al. 2011;Iwasawa et al. 2012;Ricci et al. 2013aRicci et al. ,b, 2014b) and a broad (e.g., Mushotzky et al. 1995;Nandra et al. 1997 Ricci et al. 2014a), in the broad-line region (e.g., Bianchi et al. 2008b), in an intermediate region between these two , and from very extended (> 10 − 100 pc) material (e.g., Young et al. 2001;Arévalo et al. 2014;Bauer et al. 2015).

The broad component is likely to be due to relativistic reflection from the innermost region of the accretion flow (e.g., Fabian et al. 2000;Brenneman & Reynolds 2009;Reynolds 2014), although at least for some objects it might be due to the distortion of the X-ray continuum created by highly-ionized absorbing material along the line-of-sight (e.g., Turner & Miller 2009 and references therein).

In this work we do not attempt to reproduce the broad Fe Kα emission line in the Swift/BAT AGN under study, and we limit our analysis to the more prominent and more common narrow component. This was done by adding a Gaussian emission line profile (zgauss in xspec) to all high-quality spectra (i.e., XMM-Newton EPIC/PN, Chandra, Suzaku/XIS) unless the line could not be constrained. A Gaussian line was also taken into account for Swift/XRT spectra if residuals at ∼ 6.4 keV were found fitting the continuum. The parameters of this component are the peak energy, the width (σ) and the normalization (n Gauss ) of the line. The energy of the line was fixed to 6.4 keV if it could not be constrained, while the width was fixed to 10 eV (i.e., lower than the energy resolution of the X-ray instruments we used) if the line was not resolved. The values of the energy, equivalent width (EW), width and normalization of the lines obtained are listed in Table C6. The properties of the Fe Kα line, and its relation with the physical characteristics of the accreting SMBH, will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming publication.


### Spectral models

In the following we list the different models that we adopted for the X-ray spectral fitting of our sources. In Table 2 we summarize the different spectral models, while in Figs. 8-11 we illustrate the models we used, highlighting the different components. In Fig. 12 we show, as an example of the typical fitting quality, four broad-band X-ray spectra of different types of AGN (unobscured, obscured, blazar and CT).


#### Unobscured sources

A total of 352 AGN were fitted using this set of models (i.e., model A1 to A8, top panel of Fig. 7). Model A1: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×zphabs×cabs×pexrav. This model includes primary X-ray emission and reflection, both of them obscured by the same column density. Used for 101 AGN. Model A2: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×zphabs×cabs×(pexrav + bb). This model is the same as model A1, with the addition of a blackbody component to take into account the presence of a soft excess below 1 keV. Used for 170 sources. Model A3: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ××zphabs×cabs×zxipcf×pexrav. Same as model A1 plus a layer of partially covering ionized material. Used for 35 AGN. Model A4: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×zphabs×cabs×zxipcf× zxipcf×pexrav. Same as Model A3 plus another layer of partially covering ionized material. Used for 6 objects. Model A5: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×zphabs×cabs×zxipcf×(pexrav + bb). Same as model A2 plus a partially covering ionized absorber. Used for 33 X-ray spectra. Model A6: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×zphabs×cabs×zxipcf× zxipcf×(pexrav + bb). Same as model A5 plus another partially covering ionized absorber. Used for 5 sources.

Model A7: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×(zphabs×cabs×pexrav + apec + apec) This model was used only for SWIFT J0955.5+6907 (M81) and adds emission from two components of collisionally ionized plasma to model A1. These two components, with different temperatures, are included to take into account the emission from hot gas, possibly associated to star formation and point sources (Page et al. 2003). Model A8: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×zpcfabs×zxipcf×cabs×(pexrav + bb) This model was used only for SWIFT J1210.5+3924 (NGC 4151) and adds a partially covering neutral absorber to model A5. These two components, with different temperatures are added to take into account the emission from hot gas, possibly associated to star formation and point sources (Page et al. 2003).


#### Obscured sources

A total of 386 objects were fitted using this set of models (i.e., model B1 to B9, middle panel of Fig. 7). For obscured sources we separated the primary X-ray emission from the reflection in order to leave the latter unobscured. Reprocessed X-ray radiation was taken into account by tying the values of the normalization of the power-law and of the cutoff energy to those of the primary X-ray emission, while leaving the reflection component free to vary. The value of R was set to have only negative values, in order to consider only X-ray reflection in the model. For the sources for which reprocessed and primary X-ray emission were decomposed, the crosscalibration constant was added only to the primary X-ray emission. This reflects a scenario in which most of the Xray variability is due to the obscured primary X-ray continuum, while unobscured reflected radiation, produced in the torus and/or in the BLR, does not vary significantly on the timescales probed here (e.g., Arévalo et al. 2014 


#### Blazars

A total of 97 objects were fitted using this set of models (i.e., C1 to C7, bottom panel of Fig. 7). For all the blazars, with the exception of the eight listed in §4, we considered a power-law for the primary X-ray emission and did not take into account reprocessed radiation. The models we applied are the following.   Table 3 and 4 for non-blazar AGN and blazars, respectively.

tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×(zphabs×cabs×bkn2) In this model the primary X-ray component is described by a double broken power-law. Used only for SWIFT J1256.2−0551 (3C 279).


#### Other models

For two objects (SWIFT J0956.1+6942 and SWIFT J2234.8−2542) we used two additional models to reproduce their X-ray emission. Model D1: tbabs Gal ×C BAT ×[zphabs×cabs×cutoffpl+ zphabs×cabs×(apec+apec)] Just in one case, the nearby star forming galaxy SWIFT J0956.1+6942 (M 82, z = 0.000677, i.e. the closest extragalactic Swift/BAT source), it was necessary to use a model which consisted of a cutoff power-law Xray continuum and two absorbed collisional plasmas. No AGN is present in this object (e.g., Gandhi et al. 2011), and all the X-ray flux can be explained by star formation (e.g., Ranalli et al. 2008). In this model the cutoff power-law represents the X-ray emission of the popula-tion of X-ray binaries, while the two collissionally ionized plasma models take into account the emission from hot gas. The results obtained by the spectral analysis for this object are summarised in Appendix C. Model D2: tbabs Gal ×zphabs×cabs×pow For SWIFT J2234.8−2542 we combined the results of the spectral analysis of the BeppoSAX spectrum (Malizia et al. 2000) with the Swift/BAT spectrum. This was done fitting the Swift/BAT spectrum, fixing the column density to the value reported by Malizia et al. (2000), with Model D2.


#### Compton-thick AGN

In order to self-consistently take into account absorbed and reprocessed X-ray radiation, the 75 sources that, after being fitted with the models reported above, were found to have column density values consistent with N H ∼ 10 24 cm −2 within their 90% uncertainties, were fitted with the spherical-toroidal model of Brightman & Nandra (2011). The free parameters of this model are the column density, which is the same for every line-of-sight intercepting the torus, the halfopening angle of the torus (θ OA ) and the inclination angle (θ i ). We left θ OA free to vary unless the parameter could not be constrained, in which case it was fixed to 60 degrees. To reduce the degree of complexity of the models, the value of θ i was fixed to the maximum allowed value (87 degrees) for all sources. The main properties of the CT AGN from our sample have been reported in a recently published paper , while the spectral parameters obtained are listed in Table C7.


## RESULTS

In the following we report the results obtained by the broad-band X-ray spectral analysis of the 836 AGN of our sample. In §5.1 we describe how we calculated the fluxes and luminosities, and discuss the luminosity distributions of different classes of AGN. In §5.2 we discuss the properties of the X-ray continuum, and in particular of the photon index ( §5.2.1), the cross-calibration constant ( §5.2.2), the high-energy cutoff ( §5.2.3), and the reflection component ( §5.2.4). In §5.3 we summarize the properties of the neutral ( §5.3.1) and ionized ( §5.3.2) absorbers, while in §5.4 we discuss those of the soft excess for unobscured ( §5.4.1) and obscured ( §5.4.2) non-blazar AGN. The median values of the parameters of non-blazar AGN and blazars are reported in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. Through the paper the errors on the median values are the median absolute deviations. 


### Fluxes and Luminosities

The absorption-corrected fluxes of the continuum emission (i.e., excluding the soft excess and Fe Kα component) were measured in three energy bands: 2-10, 20-50 and 14-150 keV (F 2−10 , F 20−50 and F 14−150 , respectively). To be consistent with what was reported in the Swift/BAT catalogs we also report the fluxes in the 14-195 keV band (F 14−195 ), which were obtained by extrapolating the 14-150 keV fluxes by assuming a power-law with a photon index of Γ = 1.8, consistent with the typical value found for Swift/BAT AGN (see §5.2.1). In the left panel of Fig. 13 we show the observed 2-10 flux versus the 14-195 keV flux, while in the right panel the absorption-corrected 2-10 versus the absorption-corrected 14-150 keV flux. The plot shows that, once the emission has been corrected for absorption, most of the sources lie in the region predicted for a power-law continuum with a slope in the range Γ = 1−3. In Table C8 we report the values of the observed 2-10 and 14-195 keV fluxes (F obs 2−10 and F obs 14−195 , respectively), and of the intrinsic 2-10, 20-50, 14-150 and 14-195 keV fluxes for all the sources of our sample.

The absorption-corrected and k-corrected continuum luminosities were calculated, for the 803 sources for which spectroscopic redshifts were available, in the 2-10, 20-50, 14-150 and 14-195 keV bands (L 2−10 , L 20−50 , L 14−150 and L 14−195 , respectively) using the following  Table 3 and 4 for non-blazar AGN and blazars, respectively. relation:
L i = 4πd 2 L F i (1 + z) 2−Γ ,(1)
where F i is either the 2-10, 20-50, 14-150 or 14-195 keV flux, and d L is the luminosity distance. We used redshiftindependent distance for the 44 objects at z < 0.01 for which these measurements were available (see §2.2.1).

For blazars the k-correction was calculated using the broad-band Γ for L 2−10 , and the photon index obtained by fitting the Swift/BAT spectra with a single power-law model (Γ BAT ) for the L 20−50 , L 14−150 and L 14−195 luminosities. The observed (i..e., k-corrected but not absorption-corrected) 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV luminosities (L obs 2−10 and L obs 14−195 , respectively) were calculated in a similar way. In Table C9 we report the observed 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV luminosities, and the intrinsic 2-10 keV, 20-50 keV, 14-150 keV and 14-195 keV luminosities for all the sources in our sample with spectroscopic redshifts.

The distributions of L 14−150 and L 2−10 for nonblazar AGN are shown in the top panels of Fig. 14.

These panels show that the median luminosity of unobscured AGN is higher than that of obscured AGN. This is likely related to the intrinsically different luminosity functions of obscured and unobscured AGN (e.g., Della Ceca et al. 2008; Burlon et al. 2011;Aird et al. 2015), and is consistent with the observed decrease of the fraction of obscured sources with increasing luminosity (e.g., Ueda et al. 2003;Treister & Urry 2006;Burlon et al. 2011;Ueda et al. 2014). Due to the strong beaming, blazars (right panel of Fig. 14) have on average higher luminosities than non-blazar AGN. As seen in many previous studies, among the blazars the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars are significantly more luminous than the BL Lacs (e.g., Fossati et al. 1998;Ghisellini et al. 2010).

In Koss et al. (2017) we reported the observed 2-10 keV luminosities obtained by transforming the observed 14-195 keV luminosities into 2-10 keV luminosities using a correction factor of 0.37 [i.e., L 2−10 (obs) = 0.37 × L 14−195 ]. In Fig. 15 we show that the values of L 2−10 (obs) for objects with log(N H /cm −2 ) 23.7 are in good agreement with the 2-10 keV luminosities inferred Figure 18. Scatter plot of the photon indices obtained using different approaches for objects with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≤ 23.5. The values of Γ were inferred from the broad-band (0.3-150 keV) X-ray spectral analysis as discussed in §4. Γ BAT was obtained by fitting the 14-195 keV Swift/BAT spectra with a simple power-law model, and were reported in Baumgartner et al. (2013). We calculated Γ nEc by fixing the value of the high-energy cutoff to E C = 500 keV, while Γ 0.3−10 was obtained using the best X-ray spectral model for each object, and fitting only the 0.3-10 keV spectra fixing E C = 500 keV while setting the reflection parameter to R = 0 (i.e. no reflection). The plot shows the values of Γ, Γ BAT and Γ 0.3−10 for blazars and non-blazar AGN. For Γ nEc we only show the non-blazar AGN, since no high-energy cutoff was considered when fitting blazars (with the few exceptions reported in §4).

from our spectral analysis. The scatter of ∼ 0.3 dex in the plot is likely due to differences in the shape of the X-ray continuum, and to intrinsic flux variability of the primary X-ray emission. Above log(N H /cm −2 ) ≃ 23.7 Compton scattering becomes non-negligible, and even the hard Xray emission is depleted (see Fig. 1 of Ricci et al. 2015), resulting in underestimated values of L 2−10 (obs). It should be remarked that, while most CT AGN lie in the range Γ = 1.7 − 2.3 (Fig. 13), a few sources have absorption-corrected 2-10 keV fluxes considerably higher than those expected using the 14-150 keV flux, and their L 2−10 emission might be overestimated. In the top panel of Fig. 16 we illustrate the relation between the intrinsic 14-150 keV luminosity and the 12µm luminosity (from WISE and high spatial resolution observations) for the objects of our sample. A clear correlation between the mid-IR and X-ray luminosity of non-blazar AGN has been found in the past years by a large number of studies (e.g., Lutz et al. 2004;Gandhi et al. 2009;Asmus et al. 2015;Stern 2015;Ichikawa et al. 2012Ichikawa et al. , 2017, and has been interpreted as the signature of reprocessing of the accreting SMBH emission by dust in the torus. The plot shows that CT AGN follow the same trend as obscured and unobscured sources, thus confirming that we are able to accurately constrain the intrinsic hard X-ray luminosity for these objects. A similar trend is also observed considering the 22µm luminosities (bottom panel of Fig. 16). We therefore recommend, for CT AGN, to use the 20-50 keV and 14-150 keV fluxes and luminosities, and the intrinsic 2-10 keV fluxes and luminosities obtained from Swift/BAT luminosities assuming Γ = 1.8 (see Table C10).


### X-ray continuum properties


#### Photon index

The distribution of photon indices inferred from the broad-band spectral analysis is shown in the top left panel of Fig. 17 for unobscured and obscured AGN 32 . We find that the median values (red dashed vertical lines) of Γ for sources with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 and log(N H /cm −2 ) < 22 are consistent (1.76 ± 0.02 and 1.80 ± 0.02, respectively). The total-non-blazar sample has a median of 1.78 ± 0.01, consistent with the value found by Winter et al. (2009a) (see also Alexander et al. 2013). Compton-thin obscured AGN have significantly lower photon indices (Γ = 1.70 ± 0.02) than unobscured objects, while CT AGN are found to typically have steeper slopes (Γ = 2.05 ± 0.05). The distribution of Γ of sources with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 is broader than that of AGN with log(N H /cm −2 ) < 22, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results in a p-value of ∼ 10 −4 , suggesting that the two populations are significantly different. The origin of this difference might be related to the larger 32 The median of the uncertainties on the photon index for the whole sample of non-blazar AGN is ∆Γ = 0.17. fraction of sources with lower 0.3-10 keV counts amongst the obscured sources, which increases the scatter of Γ, and to the population of CT AGN with Γ > 2. A significant difference between sources with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 and log(N H /cm −2 ) < 22 is found for the photon indices obtained by fitting the 14-195 keV Swift/BAT spectrum with a simple power-law model (Γ BAT , top right panel of Fig. 17), with unobscured AGN showing a steeper X-ray spectrum (2.02 ± 0.02) than their log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 counterparts (1.89 ± 0.02). This is likely related to the fact that Γ BAT is affected by obscuration, and that for log(N H / cm −2 ) ≫ 23 the hard X-ray continuum is flattened by the presence of the reprocessed X-ray radiation emerging from the obscured primary continuum.

To further study the shape of the X-ray continuum we calculated the photon indices using two alternative approaches. First, we re-fitted all the non-blazar AGN of our sample using the same models described in §4, fixing the high-energy cutoff to the maximum value allowed (E C = 500 keV), in order to minimize the spectral curvature due to the cutoff. We report the values of the photon index obtained using this approach (Γ nEc ) in Table C11. Second, we set E C = 500 keV, excluded the X-ray reprocessed emission 33 , and fitted the data only in the 0.3-10 keV band. This was done using the same best-fitted model obtained from the broad-band X-ray spectral analysis, ignoring, besides the high-energy cutoff and the reflection component, also the cross-calibration constant. The photon index obtained with this approach is affected by absorption for objects in which the line-ofsight column density is N H ≫ 10 23 cm −2 , since Compton scattering would significantly deplete the X-ray emission and the relative influence of the reprocessed X-ray emission would be stronger. The values of the photon index obtained following this procedure (Γ 0.3−10 ) are also reported in Table C11.

In Fig. 18 we compare the four different photon indices described above. We consider only objects with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≤ 23.5 since obscuration would most significantly affect Γ 0.3−10 above this value. The top left panel compares Γ with Γ BAT for blazars and non-blazar AGN. The plot shows that for non-blazar AGN the values of Γ are typically lower than Γ BAT . This difference is likely due to the presence of a cutoff in the modelling of the primary X-ray continuum, as found by several studies of broad-band X-ray emission of AGN (e.g., Ballantyne et al. 2014;Baloković et al. 2015;Lubiński et al. 2016). In agreement with the idea that a high-energy cutoff is almost ubiquitous in the X-ray spectra of AGN, we find that the large majority (∼ 80%) of the objects have Γ 0.3−10 < Γ BAT (top right panel). Similarly, also Γ nEc tends to be lower than Γ BAT (central left panel).

To test how reflection influences the observed value of Γ BAT we simulated Swift/BAT spectra using pexrav, setting Γ = 1.9 and E C = 500 keV, the 14-195 keV flux to (1 − 2) × 10 −11 erg cm −2 s −1 (consistent with the typical flux of the BAT AGN of our sample) assuming different values of the reflection parameter. The spectrum was then fitted with a simple power-law model, similar  Table 3 and 4 for non-blazar and blazars, respectively. The dispersion in C BAT shows the typical X-ray variability on the timescales probed here (days to several years).

to what has been done for the Swift/BAT 70-month catalog. The value of Γ BAT does not increase significantly for larger values of the reflection parameter (left panel of Fig. 19). We then carried out similar simulations, fixing the reflection parameter and varying the energy of the cutoff, and found that Γ BAT increases significantly as the energy of the cutoff decreases (right panel of Fig. 19). This clearly shows that the steepening of Γ BAT with respect to Γ is due to the presence of a cutoff.

We further find that, for most of our AGN (both blazars and non-blazar sources), Γ 0.3−10 ≃ Γ (central right panel of Fig. 18). For the blazars this is due to the fact that no cutoff or reflection were considered in the fitting, while for the non-blazar AGN this implies that we are able to recover the intrinsic value of Γ for most objects. The values of Γ nEc are substantially higher than those of Γ (bottom left panel) and Γ 0.3−10 (bottom right panel). In particular, only ∼ 21% (∼ 14%) of the objects have Γ nEc < Γ (Γ nEc < Γ 0.3−10 ). This is due to the fact that, to compensate for the spectral curvature due to the cutoff, the broad-band X-ray spectral fit carried out to obtain Γ nEc results in larger values of R and in steeper slopes.

The median value of both Γ and Γ BAT is lower for blazars (Γ = 1.68 ± 0.04, Γ BAT = 1.87 ± 0.06) than for the non-blazar AGN (1.78±0.01, 1.96±0.01). The distributions of Γ and Γ BAT are illustrated in the left and right bottom panels of Fig. 17, respectively. The X-ray continuum of the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars is very flat (Γ = 1.54 ± 0.05, Γ BAT = 1.71 ± 0.06), and it differs significantly from that of BL Lacs, which typically show steeper X-ray emission (Γ = 2.05 ± 0.06, Γ BAT = 2.42 ± 0.10). These differences in spectral shape are consistent with what has been found by Sambruna et al. (2010) who, combining Swift/BAT with Fermi/LAT spectra, argued that this behaviour (i.e., more luminous blazars are flatter in the hard X-ray band) is in agreement with the so called "blazar sequence" (e.g., Fossati et al. 1998;Inoue & Totani 2009).


#### Cross-calibration constant

As mentioned in §4, a cross-calibration constant between the soft X-ray spectra and the 70-month averaged Swift/BAT spectra (C BAT ) was added to all models. We find that both the obscured and unobscured sample have a median of C BAT = 1, consistent with the idea that the 0.3-10 keV observations are randomly sampling the variable flux of the X-ray source. In the top panel of Fig. 20 we illustrate the distribution of log C BAT for objects with log(N H /cm −2 ) < 22 (top panel) and log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 (bottom panel). The standard deviation of log C BAT for the latter (0.22 dex) is consistent with that of the former (0.21 dex).

The uncertainties on the values of C BAT are typically higher for more obscured objects (with a median of ∆C BAT ∼ 0.55) than for those with log(N H /cm −2 ) < 22 (∆C BAT ∼ 0.45) and blazars (∆C BAT ∼ 0.25). This difference is likely related to the complexity of the modelling when absorption is present, and to the fact that the soft X-ray spectra of the most obscured sources typically have a lower number of counts.

The standard deviation found for the whole sample of non-blazar AGN (σ ≃ 0.22 dex) is similar to the dispersion obtained comparing L 2−10 (obs) to L 2−10 (0.3 dex, Fig. 15). The difference between these two values (0.22 dex and 0.3 dex) could be related to differences in the spectral shape of the X-ray continuum, which would increase the dispersion of L 2−10 (obs) versus L 2−10 , as discussed in §5.1. Studying a sample of 45 Compton-thin obscured Swift/BAT AGN with Suzaku, Kawamuro et al. (2016a) found a dispersion in C BAT of 0.21 dex, which is consistent with the value obtained here. This confirms that with our spectral analysis we are able to quantify the intrinsic variability of the Xray source, and that, on the timescales probed by our study (days to several years), the X-ray variability of non-blazar AGN is ∼ 0.2 dex.

While the median value of blazars is also consistent with one (C BAT = 1.00±0.35, bottom panel of Fig. 20), it has a larger scatter (σ ≃ 0.3 dex) than for the non-blazar AGN, consistent with the stronger variability of these objects, observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., Ulrich et al. 1997). The number of blazars  Table 3. with C BAT > 2 (10) is larger than that of objects of the same class with C BAT < 0.5 (5). This is likely related to the fact that several soft X-ray observations of the blazars in our sample have been triggered by the object being in a bright state (e.g., Stroh & Falcone 2013).


#### High-energy cutoff

The distribution of the cutoff energies for the nonblazar AGN of our sample are shown in the left panel of Fig. 21. For 418 (7) sources only a lower (upper) limit of E C could be obtained. As expected, most of the 161 sources for which it was possible to constrain E C have values E C 100 keV, i.e. within the energy range covered by our spectral analysis, and a median value of E C = 76 ± 6 keV. We found that AGN with log(N H /cm −2 ) < 22 and those with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 have consistent median cutoff energies (80 ± 7 keV and 74 ± 11 keV, respectively). The eight CT AGN for which E C could be constrained have a median of 43 ± 15 keV, lower than Compton-thin and unobscured objects. This is probably due to the fact that pexrav fails to identify the curvature of the spectra of these heavily obscured objects as reprocessed emission, and associates it with an X-ray continuum with a low cutoff energy, and confirms the importance of using physical torus models to study CT AGN. We find that the mean of our sample is E C = 90 ± 5 keV and a standard deviation of σ = 61 keV. This is lower than the value found by Malizia et al. (2014) studying the broad-band X-ray spectra of a sample of 41 type-I AGN (E C = 128 keV, σ = 46 keV). We compared the values of the cutoff energy obtained by our study with those found by the analysis of NuS-TAR observations (Tortosa et al. 2017, Marinucci et al. 2016 andreferences therein), and found that the values are roughly in agreement (Fig. 22), with the exception of NGC 5506, for which the energy of the cutoff found by NuSTAR (720 +130 −190 keV, Matt et al. 2015) is significantly higher than that inferred using Swift/BAT (127 +21 −15 keV). For two of the objects reported by Marinucci et al. (2016), 3C 382  and Fairall 9 (Fabian et al. 2015), the data did not allow to constrain the energy of the cutoff.

Since for most of the sources of our sample we could only obtain lower and upper limits on the energy of the cutoff, the median and mean values reported above are not representative of the whole sample of Swift/BAT AGN. To better constrain the median of the sample, including also upper and lower limits, we performed 10,000 Montecarlo simulations for each value of E C . For each simulation we used the following approach: the values of E C of the detections were substituted with values randomly selected from Gaussian distribution centered on the best-fit value, with the standard deviation given by its uncertainty; ii) the upper limits U were substituted with a random value from a uniform distribution in the interval [0, U ]; the lower limits L were substituted with a value randomly selected from a uniform distribution in the interval [L, 1000]. In the last step we assumed that the maximum value of the cutoff energy is 1,000 keV. For each Montecarlo run we calculated the median of all values, and then used the mean of the 10,000 simulations. The values obtained are reported in Table 3. We find that the whole sample has a median cutoff energy of E C = 381 ± 16 keV, and the value of AGN with log(N H /cm −2 ) < 22 (384 ± 21 keV) is consistent with that of objects with log(N H /cm −2 ) = 22 − 24 (386 ± 25 keV), and with the one obtained for CT AGN (341 ± 70 keV). Considering a maximum cutoff energy of 500 keV (800 keV) we obtain, for the total sample, a median of E C = 244 ± 8 keV (332 ± 12 keV). These values are in good agreement with what was obtained by Ballantyne (2014) 
(E C = 270 +170
−80 keV) fitting the X-ray luminosity function of local AGN in four energy bands.

To further test the typical values of the cutoff energy, and avoid issues related to the choice of the maximum cutoff energy, we also calculated the mean and median using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and including the lower limits (see §5 of Shimizu et al. 2016 for details). We found that, for the whole sample, the median (mean) is 200 ± 29 keV (319 ± 23 keV), while for unobscured AGN is 210 ± 36 keV (331 ± 29 keV). For objects with log(N H /cm −2 ) = 22 − 24 the median (mean) is 188 ± 27 keV (262 ± 22 keV), and for CT AGN is 449 ± 64 keV (272 ± 51 keV).


#### Reflection

The distribution of the reflection parameters (R) are shown in the right panel of Fig. 21. We could constrain   and SWIFT J1737.5−2908 (Tortosa et al. 2017). The red dashed line illustrates the scenario in which the two energies are the same. The plot shows that the values of the high-energy cutoff are roughly in agreement, with the exception of NGC 5506, for which the energy of the cutoff found by NuSTAR is significantly higher than that inferred using Swift/BAT. R for 170 objects, while for 490 we obtain an upper limit and for 23 a lower limit. The median value of R among the sources for which the parameter could be constrained is R = 1.3 ± 0.1. It should be noted that this value does not correspond to the intrinsic median of hard X-ray selected AGN, since it is typically easier to infer this parameter when its value is large. We found that 51 objects have values of R > 2, albeit most of them have large uncertainties (the median fractional error is ∼ 70%), and only 16 are consistent with R ≥ 2 within their respective uncertainties. Most of the objects (35) with R ≥ 2 are unobscured AGN. This might lend support to the idea that this enhanced fraction of reprocessed flux with respect to the primary X-ray emission is caused by relativistic reflection, as predicted by the light-bending scenario (e.g., Miniutti & Fabian 2004).

We took into account the upper and lower limits on R following the same approach used for E C ( §5.2.3). In this case however we allowed the values to vary in the range [L, 10], i.e. we assumed a maximum value of R = 10. We find that the median of the whole sample is R = 0.53 ± 0.09. AGN with log(N H /cm −2 ) < 22 typically have larger reflection parameters (R = 0.83 ± 0.14) than those with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 22 (R = 0.37 ± 0.11). We also find that CT AGN have significantly lower intensity of the reprocessed X-ray continuum relative to the primary X-ray luminosity (R = 0.15 ± 0.12). The decrease of the reflection component with increasing obscuration would be in agreement with the idea that most of the reprocessing in AGN is due to the accretion disk, so that objects observed pole-on are able to see more of the reprocessed radiation than those observed edge-on. Our results are in disagreement with what was found by Ricci et al. (2011) stacking INTE-GRAL IBIS/ISGRI spectra, and with the results of Vasudevan et al. (2013b) and Esposito & Walter (2016) obtained by stacking Swift/BAT spectra. All these works in fact showed that the stacked spectra of obscured AGN tend to have more reflection than those of their less obscured counterparts. Similar results were also obtained by stacking XMM-Newton data by Corral et al. (2011). While the origin of this difference is still not clear, a possible explanation could be that the stacking of spectra with different column densities would artificially produce the curvature observed in the averaged spectrum.  Fig. 23). Among the blazars, only 13 sources are obscured, while the remaining 92 objects are unobscured (bottom panel of Fig. 23). The difference between the column density distributions of blazars and non-blazar AGN could be either related to: i) the very strong radiation field of the former; ii) the fact that in blazars a significant fraction of the X-ray emission is emitted by the jet, which implies that the region producing X-ray radiation is more extended and hence more difficult to significantly obscure in blazars than in non-blazar AGN; iii) the fact that blazars are observed pole-on and therefore it is less likely for the X-ray source to be obscured by the torus.

In Fig. 24 we show the redshift (left panel) and distance (right panel) distribution of non-blazar AGN, divided according to their line-of-sight column density into unobscured (top panel), obscured Compton-thin (middle panel) and CT (bottom panel). The fact that obscured Compton-thin AGN (middle panel) have a lower median redshift (z = 0.033) than the unobscured AGN (z = 0.047) is related to the difference in their luminosity distributions (see §5.1 for discussion), while the lower redshift of CT AGN (z = 0.017) is instead due to the influence of obscuration, which allows to detect only the nearest objects of this class (see Fig. 3 of Ricci et al. 2015).

In Fig. 25 we illustrate the ratio between the observed fluxes in the 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV bands (F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 ) versus the column density. Due to the very different impact of absorption in these two bands, we expect that, as the line-of-sight column density increases, F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 would decrease. For N H ≥ 10 23.5 cm −2 absorption plays a significant role also in the 14-195 keV band, so that the trend is expected to flatten. The plot shows a clear decrease of F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 for log(N H /cm −2 ) 22. In particular ∼ 90% of the non-blazar AGN for which F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 < 0.1 have N H > 10 23 cm −2 . For flux ratios of F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 < 0.03, ∼ 94% of the AGN are CT. However, we identify a few exceptions to this general trend. Two AGN with log(N H /cm −2 ) ≥ 24 have F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 > 0.11, both of which are well known CT AGN: ESO 138−G001 (F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 = 0.113; e.g., Piconcelli et al. 2011) and NGC 1068 (F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 = 0.14; e.g., Bauer et al. 2015). These two objects are amongst the most obscured of our sample, and the 14-195 keV flux is also strongly affected by absorption, which naturally leads  Table 3 and 4 for non-blazar AGN and blazars, respectively.

to a higher value of F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 with respect to the transmission-dominated CT AGN. In Fig. 25 we also illustrate that for most sources F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 is consistent with the expected flux ratios. These theoretical values were obtained using two different spectral models: the torus model of Brightman & Nandra (2011, red dashed lines) and MYTorus (Murphy & Yaqoob 2009, black dotted lines). The expected F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 were calculated considering the maximum value of the inclination angle allowed by the models, a half-opening angle of 60 • for the torus model of Brightman & Nandra (2011), and two different values of the photon index (Γ = 1.5 and Γ = 2.5). We added to the models a scattered power-law component with f scatt = 1%, consistent with the typical value found for Swift/BAT AGN (see §5.4.2). The only Compton-thin object with a very low flux ratio (F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−195 < 0.01) is UGC 12243. This source requires a very large cross-calibration constant (C BAT = 11.8 +22 −3.4 ) which could be due to extreme variability, with the source being in a very low-flux state at the time of the XMM-Newton observation.

While for most sources we consider only a single layer of neutral obscuring material, the unabsorbed power-law component used in our analysis to reproduce the scattered emission allows to account also for partially covering obscuration of the X-ray source. Typically, the values of f scatt of optically-selected AGN are of the order ∼ 1−5% (e.g., , so that values considerably larger than this might imply the contribution of some leaked primary X-ray continuum. In our sample we find that a total of 22 (40) non-blazar AGN have f scatt ≥ 10% (≥ 5%). Alternative explanations for the significant contribution of an unobscured component at low energies include the presence of strong star formation or a jet component dominating the X-ray emission below ∼ 2 − 3 keV. This has been found to be the case for radio galaxies (Hardcastle et al. 2006(Hardcastle et al. , 2009, which very often show additional unobscured power-law emission. In agreement with this, we find that several of the objects with f scatt ≥ 10% are radio loud, such as for example Cygnus A (f scatt = 13.3%) and 4C +21.55 (30.6%). Three out of the six blazars for which a scattered component was added to the X-ray spectrum also show f scatt ≥ 5%. For three objects, SWIFT J0552.2−0727 (NGC 2110) 34 , SWIFT J2124.6+5057 (4C 50.55) 35 , and SWIFT J2223.9−0207 (3C 445) 36 , we find that two layers of partially covering neutral material are needed to reproduce the X-ray spectrum. For these sources the values of the column density reported in Table C3 are the sum of the different components multiplied by the covering factor (as noted in §4.2).

To better constrain the column density, the 75 objects with values of N H consistent with 10 24 cm −2 within their 90% confidence interval were fitted with the torus 34 For NGC 2110 the two absorbers have column densities of N 1 H = 17.9 +1.6 −1.5 × 10 22 cm −2 and N 2 H = 2.70 +0.03 −0.03 × 10 22 cm −2 , and cover f 1 cov = 34.5 +0.9 −0.9 % and f 2 cov = 95.3 +0.3 −0.4 % of the X-ray source, respectively. An additional, fully covering, absorber with a column density of N H = 1.0 +0.1 −0.1 × 10 21 cm −2 is required to well reproduce the data.

35 For 4C 50.55 the absorbers have column densities of N 1 H = 2.2 +0.1 −0.2 × 10 22 cm −2 and N 2 H = 20 +3 −4 × 10 22 cm −2 , covering f 1 cov = 92 +1

−1 % and f 2 cov = 43 +2 −6 % of the X-ray source, respectively 36 For 3C 445 the two absorbers have column densities of N 1 H = 34 +7 −6 × 10 22 cm −2 and N 2 H = 6.7 +1.4 −1.2 × 10 22 cm −2 , covering f 1 cov = 83 +4

−5 % and f 2 cov = 98.3 +0.5 −0.4 % of the X-ray source, respectively.   Table C7 for the parameters obtained by the spectral fitting). With this approach we found that 55 Swift/BAT AGN are CT , of these 26 were identified as CT candidates for the first time. A similar study was recently carried out by Akylas et al. (2016), who found 53 CT AGN, confirming the CT nature of most of our candidates. The two objects reported by Akylas et al. (2016) as CT but not listed in Ricci et al. (2015) are NGC 4941 and NGC 3081. Both of these sources have column densities that are either consistent with being CT, or are heavily obscured. From our analysis we find that NGC 4941 has a line-of-sight column density of log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23.91 and the 90% confidence interval is log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23.81 − 24.00. NGC 3081 is also found to be heavily obscured [log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23.91], with a 90% confidence interval of log(N H /cm −2 ) = 23.87 − 23.95. The fact that these two AGN are heavily obscured is supported also by the very large EW of their Fe Kα features: 340 +87 −17 eV and 304 +33 −18 eV for NGC 4941 and NGC 3081, respectively. In Ricci et al. (2015) we did not report SWIFT J0025.8+6818 (2MASX J00253292+6821442) as CT, since the analysis of the combined Swift/BAT and the XRT spectra resulted in a column density consistent with CT within the 90% confidence interval, but with the best-fit value below the threshold (7.8 +5.4 −4.5 × 10 23 cm −2 and 6.8 +7.4 −1.7 × 10 23 cm −2 for the phenomenological and torus model, respectively). However, the analysis of the combined Chandra and Swift/BAT spectra, carried out with the torus model, confirms that this source is CT, with a column density of 1.4 +0.7 −0.9 × 10 24 cm −2 . The large EW of the Fe Kα (836 +595 −778 eV) also strongly supports the idea that this source is CT.

In the top panel of Fig. 26 we compare the column density obtained using the pexrav model versus that inferred from the torus model. There is a good agreement between the two values of N H up to log(N H /cm −2 ) ≃ 24.3. Around log(N H /cm −2 ) ≃ 24.5 the column densities obtained with the torus model become typically larger (5 out of 7 objects). Performing a linear fit of the form log N H (Torus) = α×log N H (Pexrav)+β we found a slope of α = 1.17±0.10. The fact that α > 1 is due to the difficulty of constraining column densities with pexrav for log(N H /cm −2 ) 24.5, since for these levels of obscu- ration most of the primary X-ray emission is depleted by absorption and the source is reflection dominated. Using torus models, on the other hand, it is possible to employ the shape of the reprocessed emission, as well as that of the absorbed primary X-ray emission, to infer the column density. In the central panel of Fig. 26 we show the values of Γ obtained by the two models. The plot shows that the slopes inferred by the torus model tend to be steeper than those obtained with the phenomenological model (i.e., using pexrav). In particular ∼ 72% of the sources have Γ (Torus) > Γ (Pexrav). This shows the importance of self-consistently taking into account absorbed and reprocessed X-ray emission in the most obscured AGN. The absorption-corrected fluxes obtained with pexrav and the torus model in the 2-10 keV and 14-150 keV energy ranges are illustrated in the bottom panel of Fig. 26. The plot shows that the dispersion between the fluxes obtained with the two models is lower in the 14-150 keV than in the 2-10 keV band. This is a straightforward consequence of the fact that the corrections are smaller in the 14-150 keV band.

The distribution of the half-opening angle of the torus obtained by our analysis is illustrated in Fig. 27. For most of the objects (28) we could not constrain θ OA , while for 18 (17) we are only able to infer an upper (lower) limit. For the 12 objects for which we could constrain θ OA we find a median value of 58 ± 3 degrees. The detailed study of the obscuration properties of Swift/BAT AGN is reported in (Ricci et al. 2017c), where we discuss how absorption is related to the physical characteristics of the accreting SMBH.


#### Ionized absorption

Ionized absorption has been found to be a common characteristic of unobscured AGN. Early studies carried out with ASCA found evidence of O VII and O VIII absorption edges in ∼ 50% of the sources (e.g., Reynolds 1997;George et al. 1998). More recent studies, carried out using Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and Chandra, have con-  Table 3.

firmed the presence of these warm absorbers, showing that they are related to outflows (e.g., Kaspi et al. 2000;Kaastra et al. 2000) with velocities of the order of 100-1,000 km s −1 (e.g., Tombesi et al. 2013 and references therein). The analysis of high-quality Suzaku and XMM-Newton spectra has additionally pointed out that some objects also show highly ionized outflows with velocities exceeding 10,000 km s −1 , the so-called ultra-fast outflows (e.g., Tombesi et al. 2010a,b;Gofford et al. 2013).

Evidence of ionized absorption was found in 86 AGN in Figure 29. Distribution of the blackbody temperatures obtained for unobscured non-blazar AGN. The red dashed vertical line shows the median value (see Table 3).

our sample. Of these, five are blazars, one is an obscured AGN (NGC 1365), and the remaining 80 are unobscured AGN. This implies that, on average, the covering factor of the warm absorbers in non-blazar unobscured AGN is 22%. This can be used only as a lower limit, since we might be missing ionized absorbers in objects too faint for high-quality X-ray spectra. Eleven non-blazar AGN and two blazars require two ionized absorbers to well reproduce the 0.3-10 keV spectra.

In Fig. 28 we show the distribution of the column density (top panel), the ionization parameter (middle panel) and the covering factor (lower panel) of the warm absorbers. We find that the median column density is N W H = 2.8 × 10 22 cm −2 . The median value of the ionization parameter (covering factor), for the objects for which we could constrain the values, is log[ξ/( erg cm s −1 )] = 1.45 (f W cov = 63%). These values are in good agreement with what was found by previous studies of warm absorbers (e.g., Tombesi et al. 2013 and references therein). A more detailed study of the properties of ionized absorption, and on the relation between the warm absorbers and the physical properties of the accreting SMBH will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.


### Soft excess


#### Unobscured AGN

A total of 209 unobscured AGN (i.e., ∼ 57%) in our sample show evidence for soft excesses. This is in agreement with what has been found by Winter et al. (2008;2009a; ∼ 40 − 50%) studying X-ray observations of smaller samples of Swift/BAT AGN, and with previous works carried out with ASCA (∼ 40%, Reeves & Turner 2000). The presence of a soft excess had been found to be ubiquitous in optically-selected quasars (e.g., Piconcelli et al. 2005). Scott et al. (2012) estimated that, by correcting the results obtained for a large sample of type-I AGN (Scott et al. 2011) to take into account detectability, the true percentage of sources with a soft excess is 75 ± 23%. Similarly, studying a sample of 48 Seyfert 1-1.5 galaxies observed by Suzaku and XMM-Newton, Winter et al. (2012) found that 94% of the objects show a soft excess.

The soft excess was reproduced here using a simple phenomenological model, i.e. a blackbody with a vari- Figure 30. Distribution of the fraction of scattered X-ray radiation inferred for the obscured non-blazar AGN. The black line represents the measured values, while the red dashed line represents the upper limits. The vertical blue dashed line shows the median value of the distribution (see Table 3).

able temperature and normalization. We found that the median temperature of our sample is kT bb = 0.110 ± 0.003 eV. As shown in Fig. 29, the distribution of kT bb is very narrow (σ = 0.04 eV), which is also in agreement with previous works (e.g., Gierliński & Done 2004.


#### Obscured AGN

The soft excess in obscured AGN could have several origins. It could be related to Thomson scattering of the primary X-ray radiation in ionized gas, possibly located in the photo-ionized region (e.g., Noguchi et al. 2010). In support of this idea, Ueda et al. (2015) recently demonstrated that AGN with low scattering fractions also show smaller ratios of the extinction-corrected [Oiii 5007] emission line to the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity. In addition to this, star formation could contribute significantly to the flux below ∼ 2 keV. X-ray emission in star-forming regions is due to a population of X-ray binaries and to collisionally ionized plasma (e.g., Ranalli et al. 2008). A significant contribution might also come from radiative-recombination, which would create emission lines and a continuum below ∼ 2 keV (e.g., Marinucci et al. 2011).

Here we do not attempt to model photoionized emission, and we reproduced the soft excess in obscured AGN as a combination of a scattered continuum and one or more collissionally ionized plasmas. A scattered component was added to the X-ray spectral model of 388 sources. The value of f scatt could be constrained for 251 objects, while for 137 only an upper limit was obtained (Fig. 30). The median value of the scattered fraction for the objects for which this value could be constrained is f scatt = 1.4 ± 0.6%, with 101 objects having f scatt < 1%. Following the same approach described in §5.2.3, we took into account also the lower limits in the calculation of the median value of f scatt , and found a median of f scatt = 1.0 ± 0.4% for the total sample (see Table 3). Optically-selected AGN have been shown to have significantly higher values of the fraction of scattered radiation (f scatt ∼ 1−5%; e.g., .

Smaller values of f scatt imply either a small opening angle of the torus or a smaller amount of gas responsi-ble for the scattering. Studying Suzaku observations of Swift/BAT type-II AGN, Ueda et al. (2007) found the first evidence for AGN with f scatt < 0.5%, and concluded that these objects are "buried AGN", i.e. objects that have a torus with a very large covering factor (see also Eguchi et al. 2009Eguchi et al. , 2011. It has been argued by Hönig et al. (2014) that object with f scatt < 0.5% reside in highly inclined galaxies or merger systems, which would increase the probability that the scattered emission is obscured by the host galaxy. Ueda et al. (2015) showed that, while in some cases it is possible that the host galaxy is responsible for the lower scattered fraction, more than half of the objects with f scatt < 0.5% in their sample are free from absorption by interstellar matter along the disk of the host galaxies. In our sample, 93 AGN (∼ 25% of the objects) have f scatt < 0.5%. The scattered emission, and the relation between f scatt and the physical properties of the accreting system, will be the subject of a forthcoming work (Ricci et al., in prep.).

A thermal plasma has been used for 112 objects in total (Fig. 31). For 88 object we applied a single thermal component, while for 23 two components were necessary, and in one case (MCG −03−34−064) we used three thermal plasma components with different temperatures. The median value of the temperature of this component is kT therm. = 0.49 ± 0.06 keV.


## SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We described here our detailed broad-band X-ray spectral analysis of the AGN reported in the Swift/BAT 70month catalog. Soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) spectra are available for 836 of the 838 sources detected by Swift/BAT in its first 70 months of observations, implying a completeness of ∼ 99.8%. Our sample consists of the 836 Swift/BAT objects with soft X-ray observations, of which 731 are non-beamed AGN and 105 are blazars (26 BL Lacs, 53 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and 26 of uncertain type). A variety of X-ray spectral models was applied to the 0.3-150 keV spectra. The median values of the spectral parameters of non-blazar AGN and blazars obtained by our spectral analysis are listed in Table 3 and  Table 4, respectively. The sample and the X-ray observation log are listed in Tables C1 and C2, respectively. In Table C3 we report the main spectral parameters obtained by our analysis for all sources. In the following we summarize our main findings.

• We report the values of the intrinsic (i.e., absorption-corrected and k-corrected) luminosities for all objects of our sample in the 2-10 keV, 20-50 keV, 14-150 keV and 14-195 keV bands. We find that unobscured AGN have typically higher intrinsic luminosities than obscured AGN, in agreement with the decrease of the fraction of obscured sources with increasing luminosity. Among the blazars, Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars are significantly more luminous, in all the bands discussed here, than BL Lacs, while blazars of uncertain type typically have the lowest luminosities (see §5.1 and Fig. 14).

• The median value of the photon index obtained by the broad-band X-ray spectral analysis of the non-blazar AGN is Γ = 1.78 ± 0.01. Obscured and Figure 31. Distribution of the temperatures of the thermal plasma. When more than one component was present, we averaged the values of the temperature of each object. The vertical red dashed line shows the median value of the distribution (see Table 3).

unobscured objects have consistent spectral slopes, with medians of Γ = 1.76±0.02 and Γ = 1.80±0.02, respectively (see §5.2.1 and Fig. 17). The values of Γ and of the photon index obtained by fitting the 0.3-10 keV spectrum alone (Γ 0.3−10 ) are typically lower than the Swift/BAT photon index (Γ BAT , see Fig. 18). The steepening of the X-ray continuum in the hard X-ray band suggests that the presence of a high-energy cutoff is almost ubiquitous in nonblazar AGN.

• Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars have typically flatter slopes (Γ = 1.54 ± 0.05, Γ BAT = 1.71 ± 0.06) than BL Lacs (Γ = 2.05 ± 0.06, Γ BAT = 2.42 ± 0.10). See §5.2.1 and Fig. 17.

• A cross-calibration constant was added to all models. We found that both non-blazar AGN and blazars have a median value of C BAT = 1 (see §5.2.2 and Fig. 20). From the dispersion in C BAT of non-blazar AGN we conclude that the typical variability of these objects, on the timescales probed by our study (days to several years), is ∼ 0.2 dex.

• The cutoff energy of non-blazar AGN, considering also the upper and lower limits (assuming a maximum value of E C = 1000 keV), has a median of E C = 381 ± 16 keV, and obscured and unobscured AGN have consistent median E C (see §5.2.3 and the left panel of Fig. 21). Ignoring the upper and lower limit the median values is significantly lower (E C = 76 ± 6 keV). This is due to the fact that, at the typical signal-to-noise ratio of our data, we can mostly constrain values of E C 100 keV. Using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and including the lower limits we found that, for the whole sample, the median (mean) is 200 ± 29 keV (319 ± 23 keV).

• We find that the reflection parameter of non-blazar AGN, taking into account also upper and lower limits, has a median of R = 0.53 ± 0.09 (see §5.2.4 and the right panel of Fig. 21). Unobscured objects have a larger median value (R = 0.83 ± 0.14) than Compton-thin obscured AGN (R = 0.38±0.11) and

CT sources (R = 0.15 ± 0.12). The decrease of the reflection component with increasing obscuration is in agreement with the idea that most of the reprocessed X-ray radiation originates in the accretion disk. For the objects for which we could constrain R we find a median value of R = 1.2 ± 0.2. This is larger in unobscured AGN (R = 1.4 ± 0.3) than in Compton-thin obscured AGN (R = 0.6 ± 0.2) and in CT sources (R = 0.25 ± 0.10).

• We find that the non-blazar sample is almost equally divided into AGN with N H < 10 22 cm −2 (365) and those with N H ≥ 10 22 cm −2 (366). Among the latter 56 are Compton-thick (N H ≥ 10 24 cm −2 ), and 75 have column densities consistent with N H ∼ 10 24 cm −2 (see §5.3.1 and Fig. 23).

• Evidence of ionized absorption is found in 86 AGN ( §5.3.2 and Fig. 28), most of which are unobscured. This allowed us to conclude that the covering factor of the ionized material in AGN with N H < 10 22 cm −2 is 22%.

• The soft excess in unobscured AGN could be well reproduced by a blackbody model. We found that the range of temperatures is very narrow, with a median of kT bb = 0.11 (see §5.4.1 and Fig. 29).

• The typical fraction of scattered radiation is f scatt = 1.0 ± 0.5%, lower than what is usually inferred for optically-selected AGN (see §5.4.2 and Fig. 30). A total of 93 objects (∼ 25%) have values of f scatt < 0.5%, which might imply that they are either surrounded by a torus with a very large covering factor, or that the amount of material responsible for the Thomson scattering in these objects is small. A total of 22 (40) objects have values of f scatt ≥ 10% (≥ 5%), which implies that either the obscuring material partially covers the X-ray source or that jet emission contributes significantly to the X-ray flux at 2 keV.

In the tables in the Appendix we report the parameters of the broken power-laws (Table C4), of the warm absorbers (Table C5), of the Gaussian lines (Table C6), as well as the observed and intrinsic fluxes (Table C8) and luminosities (Tables C9 and C10). In Table C11 we list the values of Γ nEC and Γ 0.3−10 , while in Table C7 we report the parameters obtained by fitting with a torus model the broad-band X-ray spectra of the 75 AGN with values of N H consistent with 10 24 cm −2 within their 90% confidence interval.

This work is part of a large effort aimed at shedding light on the multi-wavelength properties of the least biased sample of local AGN available. A series of forthcoming publications will investigate, in detail, the relations between several of the properties measured here and those of the accreting SMBHs and host galaxies. These include, among others, the absorption properties (Ricci et al. 2017c, Ricci et al. in prep.); Fe Kα line; the fraction of scattered radiation; and the relation between mergers and SMBH accretion.

Central panel: Observed (red dashed line) and intrinsic (black continuous line, from Ricci et al. 2015) column density distribution of non-blazar AGN. Bottom panel: Same as the top panel for blazars.

## Figure 24 .
24Distribution of the spectroscopic redshifts (left panels) and distances (right panels) of non-blazar AGN divided according to their line-of-sight column density: unobscured (top panels; N H < 10 22 cm −2 ), obscured Compton-thin (middle panels; 10 22 < N H < 10 24 cm −2 ) and CT (bottom panels; N H ≥ 10 24 cm −2 ). The red dashed lines show the median values of the redshift for the three subsamples. The plots are zoomed in the z = 0 − 0.4 range, similarly toFig. 2. The fact that obscured Compton-thin AGN (middle panel) have a lower median redshift and distance (z = 0.033, D = 145.2 Mpc) than the unobscured AGN (z = 0.047, D = 211.3 Mpc) is related to the difference in their luminosity distributions (see §5.1 for discussion). The lower redshift and distance of CT AGN (z = 0.017, D = 74.2 Mpc) is instead due to the influence of obscuration, which allows to detect only the nearest objects of this class (seeFig. 3ofRicci et al. 2015).

25Ratio of the observed 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV flux versus the column density inferred from the broad-band X-ray spectral analysis for the non-blazar AGN (black diamonds) and the blazars (green triangles). The plot shows the clear decrease of the F obs 2−10 /F obs 14−150 flux ratio for log(N H /cm −2 ) > 22 due to the stronger effect of absorption below 10 keV. The black dotted and red dashed lines represent the expected flux ratios (for Γ = 1.5 and Γ = 2.5) obtained considering the MYTorus model and the torus model of Brightman & Nandra (2011), respectively. model of Brightman & Nandra (2011) (see

26Top panel: Scatter plot of the values of the column density obtained by fitting the 75 most obscured objects of our sample (i.e., all those with column densities consistent with 10 24 cm −2 within their 90% confidence intervals) using pexrav and the torus model ofBrightman & Nandra (2011). The dashed line shows the 1:1 relation between the two values of N H . Central panel: same as top panel for the photon index of the primary X-ray continuum (Γ). Bottom panel: same as top panel for the absorption-corrected flux in the 2-10 keV and 14-150 keV energy ranges. The plots show that pexrav tends to underestimate N H [for log(N H /cm −2 ) 24.3] and Γ with respect to torus models.

these cases, the closest galaxy to the X-ray source with 
WISE colours consistent with an AGN was selected. 
In Appendix A we discuss the objects for which new 
counterparts were found, while in Appendix B we discuss 
the Swift/BAT sources which host dual AGN. In three 
cases, where both dual AGN contributed significantly to 
the BAT flux, we report the spectral parameters of the 
two AGN (named D1 and D2).

Swift J0324, 9+4044 ; Koss, This object is composed of two AGN at 12 ′′ from each other: IRAS 03219+4031 and 2MASX J03251221+4042021. In the 2-10 keV band IRAS 03219+4031 is ∼ 12 times brighter than 2MASX J03251221+4042021. and was therefore considered to be the counterpart of the Swift/BAT source. SWIFT J0602.2+2829. This source is composed of IRAS 05589+2828 and 2MASX J06021107+2828382 (at a distance of 20 ′′ ), with the former having a 2-10 keV X-ray flux 1100 higher than the latter (Koss et al. 2011b)SWIFT J0324.9+4044. This object is composed of two AGN at 12 ′′ from each other: IRAS 03219+4031 and 2MASX J03251221+4042021. In the 2-10 keV band IRAS 03219+4031 is ∼ 12 times brighter than 2MASX J03251221+4042021 (Koss et al. 2011b), and was therefore considered to be the counterpart of the Swift/BAT source. SWIFT J0602.2+2829. This source is composed of IRAS 05589+2828 and 2MASX J06021107+2828382 (at a dis- tance of 20 ′′ ), with the former having a 2-10 keV X-ray flux 1100 higher than the latter (Koss et al. 2011b).

The 2-10 observed flux of Mrk 739W is ∼ 9% of that of Mrk 739E (Koss et al. 2011b), and the latter source was reported as the counterpart of the BAT AGN. SWIFT J1315.8+4420. This source is composed of UGC 8327 NED01 and UGC 8327 NED02, located at 37 ′′ from each other. The 2-10 keV flux of UGC 8327 NED01 is ∼ 1140 times higher than that of UGC 8327 NED02. Koss, SWIFT J0945.6−1420. This object is composed by two sources at 180 ′′ from each other: NGC 2992 and NGC 2993. Since the former AGN is ∼ 7 times brighter in the 2-10 keV band than the latter (Koss et al. 2011b) it was considered as the counterpart of SWIFT J0945.6−1420. SWIFT J1023.5+1952. The XMM-Newton EPIC/PN image reveals that, within the error box of the Swift/BAT position, both members of the interacting pair ESO 509−IG066 (Guainazzi et al. 2005) are detected. These two sources are ESO 509−IG066E/NED02 (SWIFT J1334.8−2328D1) and ESO 509−IG066W/NED01 (SWIFT J1334.8−2328D2), with the eastern component having a 2-10 keV flux ∼ 60% of the western component. SWIFT J1341.2+3023. The source is composed of two objects at 59 ′′ : Mrk 268 and Mrk 268SE. The counterpart of the Swift/BAT source is Mrk 268, since it has a 2-10 keV flux > 108 times higher than that of its companion (Koss et al. 2011b)SWIFT J0945.6−1420. This object is composed by two sources at 180 ′′ from each other: NGC 2992 and NGC 2993. Since the former AGN is ∼ 7 times brighter in the 2-10 keV band than the latter (Koss et al. 2011b) it was considered as the counterpart of SWIFT J0945.6−1420. SWIFT J1023.5+1952. This dual AGN is composed of NGC 3227 and NGC 3226, located at 130 ′′ from each other. In the 2-10 keV band NGC 3227 is ∼ 73 times brighter than NGC 3226 (Koss et al. 2011b), and was therefore assumed to be the counterpart of SWIFT J1023.5+1952. SWIFT J1136.0+2132. The counterpart of this source is a late-stage galaxy merger composed of two nuclei with a projected separation of 3.4 kpc (5 ′′ ): Mrk 739E and Mrk 739W (Koss et al. 2011b). The 2-10 observed flux of Mrk 739W is ∼ 9% of that of Mrk 739E (Koss et al. 2011b), and the latter source was reported as the counterpart of the BAT AGN. SWIFT J1315.8+4420. This source is composed of UGC 8327 NED01 and UGC 8327 NED02, located at 37 ′′ from each other. The 2-10 keV flux of UGC 8327 NED01 is ∼ 1140 times higher than that of UGC 8327 NED02 (Koss et al. 2011b), and this source was therefore considered to be the counterpart of the Swift/BAT object. SWIFT J1334.8−2328. The XMM-Newton EPIC/PN image reveals that, within the error box of the Swift/BAT position, both members of the interacting pair ESO 509−IG066 (Guainazzi et al. 2005) are detected. These two sources are ESO 509−IG066E/NED02 (SWIFT J1334.8−2328D1) and ESO 509−IG066W/NED01 (SWIFT J1334.8−2328D2), with the eastern component having a 2-10 keV flux ∼ 60% of the western component. SWIFT J1341.2+3023. The source is composed of two objects at 59 ′′ : Mrk 268 and Mrk 268SE. The counterpart of the Swift/BAT source is Mrk 268, since it has a 2-10 keV flux > 108 times higher than that of its companion (Koss et al. 2011b).

have recently shown that both sources contribute significantly to the flux above 10 keV. The intrinsic 10-40 keV luminosities are 7.1 × 10 43 erg s −1 and 2.7 × 10 43 erg s −1 for the southern and northern nucleus, respectively (Puccetti et al. 2016). Bianchi, The Chandra study of (Bianchi et al. 2008a) showed that both nuclei are obscured, and (Koss et al. 2011b) reported that the 2-10 keV observed flux of Mrk 463W is ∼ 25% that of Mrk 463E. SWIFT J1652.9+0223. This source is a combination of two objects at 91 ′′ from each other: NGC 6921 and MCG +04−48−002. with the former AGN contributing to ∼ 20% of the 14-195 keV flux. Since the two AGN contribute significantly to the Swift/BAT flux we reported the characteristics of both NGC 6921 (SWIFT J2028.5+2543D1) and MCG +04−48−002 (SWIFT J2028.5+2543D2) in the catalog. SWIFT J2328.9+0328. This object is the combination of the unobscured AGN NGC 7679 and the CT AGN NGC 7682 (at 270 ′′ ). Since NGC 7679 contributes to only ∼ 10% of the 14-195 keV flux, we adopted NGC 7682 as the counterpart of the Swift/BAT sourceSWIFT J1355.9+1822. This source is another known dual AGN, with the two nuclei (Mrk 463E and Mrk 463W, at 4 ′′ ) having a projected separation of 3.4 kpc (Bianchi et al. 2008a). The Chandra study of (Bianchi et al. 2008a) showed that both nuclei are obscured, and (Koss et al. 2011b) reported that the 2-10 keV observed flux of Mrk 463W is ∼ 25% that of Mrk 463E. SWIFT J1652.9+0223. The luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240 is known to host two Compton-thick AGN sepa- rated by 0.7 kpc (1.8 ′′ ): NGC 6240N and NGC 6240S (Komossa et al. 2003). The two sources have comparable observed 2-10 keV fluxes (Koss et al. 2011b), and Puccetti et al. (2016) have recently shown that both sources contribute sig- nificantly to the flux above 10 keV. The intrinsic 10-40 keV luminosities are 7.1 × 10 43 erg s −1 and 2.7 × 10 43 erg s −1 for the southern and northern nucleus, respectively (Puccetti et al. 2016). Since the XMM-Newton observation used here lacks the spatial resolution to resolve the two nuclei the system was considered to be one source. SWIFT J1816.0+4236. The source is composed of UGC 11185 NED01 and UGC 11185 NED02 (at 28 ′′ ). Since UGC 11185 NED02 has a 2-10 keV flux > 23.3 times larger than UGC 11185 NED01 (Koss et al. 2011b), it was considered to be the counterpart of the BAT source. SWIFT J2028.5+2543. This source is a combination of two objects at 91 ′′ from each other: NGC 6921 and MCG +04−48−002, with the former AGN contributing to ∼ 20% of the 14-195 keV flux. Since the two AGN contribute significantly to the Swift/BAT flux we reported the characteristics of both NGC 6921 (SWIFT J2028.5+2543D1) and MCG +04−48−002 (SWIFT J2028.5+2543D2) in the catalog. SWIFT J2328.9+0328. This object is the combination of the unobscured AGN NGC 7679 and the CT AGN NGC 7682 (at 270 ′′ ). Since NGC 7679 contributes to only ∼ 10% of the 14-195 keV flux, we adopted NGC 7682 as the counterpart of the Swift/BAT source.
