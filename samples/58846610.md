be monitored more closely. It seems that that should at least be considered when assessing patient risk factors and choosing a prenatal care strategy. These women may have particular socioeconomic factors that put them at risk of cervical dysplasia as well as preterm birth. Surgeons caring for reproductive-aged women with cervical dysplasia should consider treatments that minimize the volume of cervical tissue removed, and obstetricians caring for women with a history of cervical dysplasia should consider this a potential risk factor regardless of prior treatment. The optimal intervention remains to be determined.-MEN) ABSTRACT Approximately 7.9 million children are born with birth defects, and 3.3 million children younger than 5 years die because of congenital anomalies annually. It is well known that congenital malformations contribute significantly to neonatal mortality. Eclampsia and preeclampsia affect 0.3% to 1.4% and 2% to 8% of pregnancies, respectively, and also cause significant maternal-fetal morbidity and adverse perinatal outcomes. Only a few studies have explored the associations between preeclampsia and congenital malformations.This study aimed to inspect the association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations in the newborn by using data collected from 29 countries worldwide as part of the World Health Organization Multicountry Survey. The study, conducted from 2010 to 2011, gathered data from more than 314,000 deliveries and data from all live births (n = 310 401) to evaluate the risk of 6 categories of congenital malformations including "neural tube/ central nervous system," "cardiac," "renal," "limb," "lip/cleft/palate," and "chromosomal" against maternal hypertensive disorders classified into "chronic hypertension," "preeclampsia," and "eclampsia" by logistic regression models.The frequency and distribution of malformations in 1706 newborns, and per 1000 live births, was 322 and 1.04 (neural tube/central nervous system), 494 and 1.59 (cardiac), 136 and 0.44 (renal), 367 and 1.18 (limb), 212 and 0.68 (lip/cleft/palate), and 175 and 0.56 (chromosomal), respectively. The occupied territories of Palestine displayed the highest rates of all malformation types except for the lip/cleft/palate type, whereas Niger reported only 2 incidences of limb malformations, with a total of 0.2 malformation/1000 live births. The highest prevalence of malformations in entirety was found in the Region of the Americas, with 9.2 cases/1000 live births, and the lowest in the African Region with 2.5 cases/1000 live births. Chromosomal malformations were observed to be significantly greater with increasing maternal age and increasing number of previous

births; likewise, cardiac malformations were reported to be significantly more common as maternal age and years of education increased. It was found that newborns of women with chronic maternal hypertension were at higher risk of renal (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-10.7), limb (aOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7-9.0), and lip/cleft/palate malformations (aOR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.5-11.6), whereas preeclampsia was significantly associated with cardiac (aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6-3.5) malformations. The association between the chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia and neural tube/central nervous system (aOR,4.3;95% CI,renal (aOR,8.7; 95% CI, 2.5-30.2), limb (aOR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.1-23.5), and lip/cleft/palate (aOR, 8.2; 95% CI, 2.0-34.3) malformations was strengthened by the multivariable analysis. The study concluded that maternal chronic hypertension exposed newborns to a significant risk of developing renal, limb, and lip/cleft/palate congenital malformations, and the risk was further aggravated by superimposed preeclampsia.


## EDITORIAL COMMENT

(A specific cause of congenital malformations, such as congenital heart defects, spina bifida, and cleft lip/palate, is not known in most cases; these anomalies are thought to be largely multifactorial or complex disorders that arise because of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While in most cases the environmental factors are not determined, some infections, drugs, environmental exposures, and maternal conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes are known to increase risk. Interestingly, many of the same biomarkers that are seen in mothers with preeclampsia have been noted to be present in women carrying fetuses with congenital heart defects (N Engl J Med 2004;350:672-683; Eur Heart J 2014;35 (11):701-707, 680-682), and a recent study in JAMA (2015;314(15):1588-1598) noted that fetal congenital heart defects were associated with an increased risk of maternal preeclampsia.

In this abstracted article, the authors noted that an association has been reported between maternal hypertensive disorders and a number of different fetal malformations. They therefore sought to explore this association using data from the World Health Organization Multicountry Survey; they found that maternal chronic hypertension was associated with an increased risk of several categories of fetal malformations and that several types of fetal anomalies were associated with an increased risk of maternal preeclampsia. The mechanisms behind these associations are unclear, and the authors conclude that additional research is needed to identify shared pathways of maternal hypertensive disorders and congenital malformations.

Given our limited understanding of the development of most types of fetal anomalies, hypotheses as to the pathophysiologic basis for these associations are speculative. It is possible that some of this is ascertainment bias, as the rate of malformations was highest in high development index countries.  (7):1002-1009). It also appears that some of the high rates of anomalies in some settings (eg, Pakistan) are due to consanguinity, which increases the risk of autosomal recessive as well as multifactorial disorders. However, this has not previously been recognized to be associated with preeclampsia. Finally, it is possible that many women with chronic hypertension have metabolic syndrome, which may be associated with abnormal glycemic control.

One interesting point made by the authors-the risk of some anomalies (eg renal, limb, and clefting disorders) was increased with maternal chronic hypertension and increased yet more with superimposed preeclampsia, suggesting a "doseresponse" relationship. Data suggest that the fetus with congenital heart defects may have altered angiogenesis in the trophoblast that leads to abnormal formation of the heart. It has been noted that 20% of all stillbirths and 30% of neonatal deaths have abnormalities of the heart and great arteries; perhaps some of this excess perinatal mortality is due to aberrant angiogenesis and not only the cardiac structure itself.

While teratogenic effects of conditions such as pregestational diabetes and some medications are easily understood and explained, the association of chronic hypertension and birth defects is less well known and more difficult to explain. It appears that physiological changes early in pregnancy that manifest in gestational hypertension and preeclampsia may play a role in the etiology of major birth defects. In some cases, it seems that aberrant angiogenic factors and abnormal flow through the developing fetal cardiovascular system may contribute to congenital heart disease. While the mechanisms are not well understood, and the question of which came first is unanswered, this fascinating association will undoubtedly lead to interesting new research endeavors and hopefully increase our understanding of preeclampsia as well as the etiology of congenital malformations.

For the clinician, in the meantime, the risk of preeclampsia is always present and something for which obstetrical providers are always on alert. If the fetus is known to have a major structural abnormality, the risk of preeclampsia appears to be higher. It seems that such pregnancies bear close watching in the third trimester. ABSTRACT Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and the increased proportion of twin births is one factor that contributes to PTB. A short cervical length (CL) in midgestation is one among the various risk factors that is considered predictive for spontaneous PTB of less than 32 weeks in twin gestations. One prior study recommended a CL of 20 mm as the cutoff for the prediction of PTB. This current retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of CL for spontaneous PTB of less than 32 weeks' gestation in twin pregnancies and to estimate the cutoff point that had the best sensitivity and specificity.

Data from twin pregnancies at 16 weeks' gestation in a single center between 2001 and 2013 were analyzed; exclusion criteria included cases with fetal anomalies, higher-order and monoamniotic pregnancies, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome cases or intrauterine therapy cases, and pregnancies with indicated PTB. The CL was measured on transvaginal ultrasound between 18 and 23 weeks' gestation as per the standard protocol. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between pregnancy characteristics and PTB of less than 32 weeks' gestation, and the CL value predictive for PTB of less than 32 weeks' gestation was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves. Of a total of 940 twin pregnancies, only CL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.99) was independently associated with PTB, whereas monochorionicity (aOR, 4.14; 95% CI, 0.89-19.25) and nulliparity (aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.34-3.15) were not found to be significantly associated with PTB. The CL displayed an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.58-0.71) for PTB prediction at less than 32 weeks' gestation. The optimal cutoff value was 36 mm (sensitivity, 64.1%; specificity, 62.8%; positive predictive value, 13.5%; negative predictive value, 95.1%; accuracy, 62.9%). The relative risk of PTB for a CL of 36 mm or less compared to a CL of more than 36 mm was 2.35 (95% CI, 1.53-3.60). An approximate 35.9% (28/78) of PTB cases at less than 32 weeks' gestation had a normal CL in midgestation while considering 36 mm as the cutoff, whereas by considering a 20-mm cutoff, 85% of women who later delivered at less than 32 weeks' gestation had a normal CL in midgestation.

The study concluded that CL evaluated in midgestation was a poor predictor of PTB of less than 32 weeks' gestation in asymptomatic twin pregnancies, although a weak independent association between CL and PTB was observed.


## EDITORIAL COMMENT

(Preterm birth continues to be a significant public health problem and is the most common cause of neonatal mortality worldwide. The high rate of PTB in the United States is due at least in part to the increased proportion of twin births, as a result of older maternal age and greater use of
