22 November 202328A0D140DF9515F070923B5AA4FCABBD10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22673Received 24 March 2022; Received in revised form 20 October 2023; Accepted 16 November 2023Marine bioproduct Fisheries industry Fish byproduct Seafood waste Valorization
From ancient times fish has always been considered as an important human food item.The purpose of this article is to introduce the perception that beside consumption, fish can also be used as a raw material for the industrial production of different products.In this article such 19 products have been described.Among them, the conventional fish products described herein include isinglass, pituitary gland, chitin, chitosan, pearl essence, fish skin leather, fish protein hydrolysates and concentrates, fish meal and scrap, fish oil, collagen, gelatin, glue, fish silage, pet food and wet feed from fish, fish fertilizer and compost.These products have important applications in aquaculture, agriculture, food, cosmetics and other industries.Different nonconventional hi-tech fish products has been reported such as novel antimicrobial proteins from skin mucus, enzymes, insulin, protamine, blood proteins, salcotonin, antifreeze proteins, hydroxyapatite, burn treatment bandage, albumins, fishbone calcium powder, biochar, biopolymer, bioplastics, fish industry derived rinse water recovery.These products have many significant applications in chemical, biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.Economical, logistic, environmental and technological considerations from fish waste valorization perspectives has also been presented to evaluate feasibility of industrial-scale production of these products.

## Introduction

For availability of water, ancient major civilizations of the world developed along rivers; for example, Mesopotamian civilizations around the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers; Indus valley civilization around the Indus river [1].So, from time immemorial fish found in nearby rivers and water bodies of human localities has been harvested for human consumption and they become a symbol of food in life and cultures e.g.painting of fishes in the Egyptian burial chamber, Christmas eating of lutefisk in Norway and Sweden.In this way, fish has always been perceived important as a proteinaceous food item only.

In many regions of the world, there are some fish species which are always considered less preferred food items for consumption.For example, due to the presence of smaller intramuscular bones called pins, Cyprinus carpio cooked whole or fillets are ignored in the United States.In North America, New Zealand, and in Australia carps are treated as pest species [2].In Bangladesh, Oreochromis niloticus, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthys nobilis, Cyprinus carpio var.specularis, Barbonymus gonionotus are cultured abundantly and cheap.Throughout the world such low-valued fishes that grown and/or produced abundantly are found in every locality.Exact data about worldwide fish processing waste is not available.However, it could be assumed that with 178.5 million tons of fish production in 2018, during processing operations up-to 70 % of it was discarded as waste in the form of scales (5 %), fins and skins (1-3%), viscera (12-18 %), head (9-12 %), bones (9-15 %) and muscle-trimmings (15-20 %) [3,4].Globally 9.1 million tonnes of fish is bycatched annually [4].These bycatched fishes are generally used to produce fish meal or fish oil.

Advancement in interdisciplinary science suggest that, low-valued fish, fish processing waste, bycatched fish can be used to produce various novel products e.g.fish enzymes, collagen, insulin, antimicrobial compounds, biopolymers [5,6].The aquatic environments contain countless genetic resources and thus represent an enormous potential for discovering unforeseen products [7].The objective of this paper was to review the potential of utilizing fish indutrially that are typically not preferred as food or considered low in value.By doing so, we intended to introduce a novel concept that goes beyond the conventional notion 'fish for food'.

Traditionally, Bangladesh and South Asia region are well-known for their fisheries resources due to having a favorable climate and vast inland and marine waterbodies.Bangladesh is one of the major fish producing countries in the world.In 2022 Bangladesh produced about 4.6 million ton fish, shrimp and crab by utilizing 4.7 million hectors of inland and 0.11 million km 2 marine waters.For Bangladesh, fisheries is the second largest export-oriented sector [8].The country has 237 fish landing centers, 133 fish industries which are basically fish and shrimp freezing plants and 5440 fish markets.People in Bangladesh consume 71 % of a fish and remaining 29 % are discarded as waste.Therefore, every year approximately 93,000 tons fisheries waste are produced.A minor fration (about 900 tons) of this huge amount of waste is utilized [9] and usually these waste are thrown away into canals, rivers, pond, dustbins or sea.This practice on one hand is polluting environment; while on the other hand, it is overlooking the potential to produce commercially important bioproducts from fisheries waste, thereby subsequently missing the opportunities for earning foreign currency.The scenario is not different in other South Asian countries and other geographic regions such as North Africa, the Caribbean.The technologies described in this paper are important to utilize fisheries waste in these regions.Further, this paper is expected to raise awareness among stakeholders e.g.academicians, researchers, policy makers, managers and other professionals associated with fisheries industries.

Apart from the aforementioned national and regional perspectives, from global viewpoint, it is time to think about utilizing less preferred fishes for consumption, fish processing waste and bycathced fish as a substrate for industrial production of bioproducts.Because, it is unavoidable that the present 7 billion human population of the world will reach 8.8-10 billion by 2050 [10].To meet up demands of that extra population, bioresources i.e. plant, animals, microbes should be industrially tailored.'Blue Economy' and 'Circular Economy' concept support this idea.Blue economy means utilization of aquatic resources in a sustainable manner by applying innovative technologies [11].EU has declared action plans on blue economy [12].Through innovative technologies e.g.biorefinery processes, it is possible to produce novel industrial bioproducts by utilization of seafood processing waste [13,14].In circular economy, materials and services are repeatedly recycled in ecofriendly manner.Circular economy concept is appropriate for fish waste utilization (Fig. 1) [15].Number 14th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the United Nations addresses 'Life below water' theme.Therefore, considering the rapid population growth, blue economy, circular economy and SDG perspectives, this article is important.


## Industrially producible fish products

Based on raw materials i.e., which body part of fish is used, all the products can be classified into 9 major groups (Fig. 2).


### Fish skin products


#### Novel antimicrobial proteins

Mucus functions in innate immune mechanism in two ways: i) it is produced continuously and sloughed off regularly to carry away adhered microbes and parasites; ii) contains several different proteins and enzymes thereby act as innate immunity factors e.g.immunoglobulin, complement proteins, lysozyme, C-reactive protein (CRP), lectins, proteolytic enzymes, transferrin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and various other antibacterial proteins and peptides [16][17][18][19].Studies have reported that antimicrobial proteins found in fish mucus exhibit inhibitory effects against various bacteria e.g.Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and fungi e.g.Candida albicans, Issatchenkia orientalis [20].

Non-ionic detergent mediated differential extraction method can be used to isolate such antimicrobial proteins.Similar to insect derived defensins, which destroy bacteria by creating large holes in cell membranes, these proteins act on cellular ion exchange channels.Also, these proteins exhibit hemolytic activities [21].Antimicrobial proteins from fish skin mucus have no cytotoxic effects [20].


#### Burn treatment bandage and leather

Due to presence of type I collagen and high moisture content, tilapia skin is able to withstand mechanical stress e.g.stretching.Tilapia skin bandage in treatment of second-and third-degree burn patients accelerates healing and reduces pain medications, thus, decreases treatment cost by more than 60 % in contrast to conventional treatment.To prepare fish skin bandage, the skin is sterilized chemically, then glycerolized, irradiated and finally stored aseptically in refrigerator [22,23].

Recently, commercial-scale leather production using skin collected from fish fillet mill has been reported in Kenya [24].Skin of sharks, sting ray, salmon, cat fish, cod, haddock, cusk, pollock and carp can be used as leather.Shark and seal skin products are exotic and prestigious to consumers, similar to alligator skin products.Shark skin is often used as sand paper [25].

Fish skin to leather processing is similar to land animal's skin except scale removal.Shark scales are removed chemically.In case of salmon skin, scales are mechanically cut off at the roots.Salmon skins are aniline-dyed [25].


### Gut and visceral organs 2.2.1. Enzymes

Fish enzymes are different than terrestrial sources in respect of amino acid composition, molecular weight, optimum pH and temperature, stability, kinetic and inhibition characteristics [26] due to adaptation of fish in various extreme environments e.g.excess salinity, hydrostatic pressure, very cold or hot water, scarcity of limiting nutrients, oceanic caves or hydrothermal vent like habitats.For example, cold-adapted enzymes from the Antarctic fish relatively require low activation energies, thus exhibit unique thermosensitivity and high substrate specificity [27][28][29].

Proteases constitute about 50 % of the total industrial enzyme market [15,30].Basic extraction steps to harvest protease from fish viscera are comminution, homogenization, centrifugation, separation of precipitation and supernatant, saturation, dissolution and dialysis.Extracted protease whether will be acidic or alkaline is dependent on variation in steps of extraction method [31,32].Enzymes from fish and shellfish are used for different important purposes, for example, product (e.g.pharmaceuticals, cosmeceuticals), processes (e.g.food, leather processing), by-product recovery (e.g.stickwater viscosity reduction), basic research (e.g.biosensors, gene cloning) [27,33].To adopt an enzyme for commercial use, factors needed to be considered are: (1) reactant concentration (2) operational conditions (e.g.temperature, pH and time), and (3) reaction modulators (e.g.inhibitor/activator) [34].Trypsin from the spleen of albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) onto octyl sepharose CL-4B produces a stable immobilized enzyme system [35].


#### Insulin

In contrast to cattle insulin which remains dispersed in pancreas, more pure, stable and concentrate form of insulin is easily extractable from fish gall-bladder or bile duct [36,37].There are some variations in amino acid sequence of insulin derived from different fish species and domestic animals.Insulin derived from fish was found to be weak than bovine/pig insulin due to immunological difference.However, physicians did not report any significant difference in function of insulin derived from fish and domestic animals [38].Labeo rohita bile attenuates caused significant hypoglycemic activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in rats [39].Amount of insulin found in some fishes has been presented in Table 1 [38].

To manufacture fish insulin, raw material from visceral mass must be fixed as soon as possible to avoid degradation of raw material.For fixation, visceral mass is crushed with picric acid and the material is transferred into saturated picric acid solution.Addition of acetone to that solution dissolve and separate picrate of insulin from the picrates of other proteins.Picrate of insulin treated with a mixture of hydrochloric acid and alcohol produces water-soluble insulin hydrochloride.Finally, to refine, alkali is added in insulin hydrochloride to precipitate the insulin [36,40].Transgenic Nile tilapia can be used to produce insulin [41].


#### Isinglass/fish maws

The word 'isinglass' is derived from a similar-sounding Dutch word which means sturgeon's air bladder or swimming bladder.Cleaned and dried fish air bladder is known as isinglass.Main uses of isinglass include beverage clarification, adhesive base, binder in glass or pottery, leather belt repair, textile sizing, ingredient of India ink, confectionery products [42].

Relatively large and easily detachable air bladders are suitable for isinglass production.Usually 1 ton of hake yield about 45 pounds dry isinglass of approximately 85 % gelatin content, while 18 pounds of a poorer-quality product of 50 % gelatin content is found from 1 ton of cod [42].In India, Protonibea diacanthus, Istiophorus platypterus fish [27] and in Bangladesh, freshwater species Pangasianodon hypopthalamus, Gibelion catla, Wallago attu, Labeo rohita and marine species Lates calcarifer, Lutjanus johnii, Eleutheronema tetradactylum, Acanthopagrus morrisoni has been used for isinglass production.In isinglass processing, as preliminary treatment, air bladders are detached during the dressing operation aboard ship and preserved by salting.After landing those swimming bladders are slit opened, thoroughly washed and air-dried.The dried bladders are immersed in water for several hours to soften them and then mechanically cut into small pieces, pressed between hollow iron rollers, converted into thin strips of 3-6 mm thickness and dried.Leaf and book are the two forms of commercially produced isinglass [37,42].


### Fish induced breeding hormone

Probably artificial fish breeding through hypophysation is the single most innovation that transformed ancient fish farming to present day's modern aquaculture.Pituitary gland (PG) extract is commonly ued inducing agent for hypophysation.PG collected beneath from fish brain is stored in vial contains acetone.After gathering sufficient number of PGs, old acetone is drained off and fresh acetone is added in the vial.About after 24 h, the acetone is drained off and the PGs are dried on tissue paper.The acetone-dehydrated and defatted PGs are stored in a glass phial, pressed down with a fine cotton ball, corked tightly and sealed by wax.Acetone-dried PGs can be stored for many years e.g. at least 5-8 years in sub-tropical and tropical regions.The sealed phials have to be kept in a plastic bag with silica gel or in a desiccator.PGs can also be preserved in absolute alcohol or by instant freezing [43].


### Miscellaneous biochemical and pharmaceutical products

Nucleic acids and nucleosides, protamines, strepogenin, glutathione, cortisone, bile salts, blood proteins, salcatonin, and antifreeze proteins are of scientific and technical interest.In spite of potential usefulness of these products, none are yet been produced commercially except protamine.

Salmon and herring sperm are the commercial sources of protamine.Protamine is commercially available as off-white crystalline or amorphous powder or clear, colorless and odorless aqueous solution.During delivery and heart surgery, protamine is used to neutralize heparin's anticoagulant effect [44].Protamines combined with insulin decrease the rate of insulin absorption by tissue, therefore, markedly prolong the effectiveness of the insulin [36].

The main component of Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus mrigala bile is taurine derivative of lithocholic acid [45].Rainbow trout-extracted blood protein fractions exhibit good solubility, thermal stability, textural, emulsifying, and foaming properties, therefore these protein fractions are applicable in food industries [46].Fish blood plasma derived cortisone has anti-inflammatory function [47].Fibrin from blood of salmon is suitable to produce fibrin sealant.Potential biomedical applications of fibrin sealant include wound healing, haemostasis, tissue engineering and cell therapy [48].Salcatonin or salcotonin is 10-40 times more potent than human calcitonin.Salcatonin also stimulates calcitonin synthesis; which in turn prevent bone resorption by osteoclast, and renal-calcium conservation, thus could be used to treat osteoporosis [49].Piscidins, defensins, cathelicidins, hepcidins, and histone-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are found in fishes.Among them as a broad-spectrum AMP, piscidins are therapeutically important [50].

Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are 2.4-36 kDa glycopeptides found in blood colloidal fractions of winter flounder, sculpins, Atlantic cod, Atlantic wolfish, Greenland cod.AFPs lower freezing point is 200-300 times more than salt and possesses no toxicity.So, AFPs has Fig. 3. Processing of different concentrated fish protein products.

Md.S.I.Sarkar et al. the potential to use in frozen foods e.g. in dairy products as ice modulators [51].


### Fish scale products

As a source of minerals, fish scales are used to formulate poultry feed [52].Fish scales are a source of chitin and chitosan [53].Chitin is extracted from fish scale through two steps-deproteinization and demineralization.Chitosan is produced through deacetylation of chitin [54].Chitin and chitosan are non-toxic and inexpensive.Applications of chitin and chitosan include stem cell technology, drug and gene delivery, wound healing, tissue engineering, cosmetics, food industry, heavy metals removal, antimicrobial activity [55].

Fish scales are used in biocomposite materials e.g.wheat gluten-based bioplastics with scales show good dynamic mechanical properties and weigh less [56].Hydroxyapatite [Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6 (OH) 2 ] (HAP) synthesized from fish scale and bone is a very important material because of its applications in bone tissue engineering, dental treatment, drug delivery system [57], removal of heavy metals [58], catalysis of acrolein and/or acrylic acid, fatty acid nitriles production [59,60].Potential applications of HAP include defluoridation [61] and absorbing and decomposing CO from automobile exhaust [62].The best, widely used and low-cost methods of HAP production are hydrothermal method, solvent thermal method and precipitation method [63].

Guanine deposit in scales of fishes (e.g.herring, sardine, salmon, ribbon fish, menhaden), when extracted, shows a lustrous effect.This lustrous effect is known as 'pearl essence' and used in lacquers of plastics for decorating many articles such as manicure, toilet seats, jewellery boxes, umbrella handles.There are three methods to produce pearl essence-i) scrubbing lustrous material from scales in a large agitator; ii) sock scales in gasoline; iii) using protein enzyme e.g.trypsin and benzol [36,52].

Dried fish scales can be used in wastewater treatment systems as a flocculating agent to precipitate the solid material, particularly protein materials [64].Dried fish scales are cheaper than chitosan and safer than traditional flocculating agents [52].Biosorbents prepared from fish scale is applicable to remove pharmaceuticals pollutants, heavy metals and dyes from wastewater [65].Materials recovered from scales may have the potential as animal feed or plant fertilizer.It was reported that, only a small fraction of total fish sacles produced in Bangladesh are either exported to China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand or used in local poultry and fish feed industries.So, there is potential to expand the export market or use the remaining unutilized fish scales for development of aforementioned products [66].


### Muscle products

In this section, fish protein concentrates and fish oil have been described.There is ambiguity about whether fish protein concentrates and fish oil are food or non-food industrial products.These products are actually utilized as food supplement.Concept and production technologies of these products are quite exceptional than conventional fish food items i.e. ready-to-eat cooked fish.Moreover, these products have applications in different industries e.g.pharmaceutical, leather, soap, rubber industries.Therefore, in this paper, fish protein concentrates and fish oil have been considered as non-food industrial products [36].


#### Fish protein concentrates

Different concentrated fish protein products have been shown in Fig.

3 [67].Bioactivities (anti-oxidative, anti-microbial, anti-anemic, anti-hypertensive, antithrombotic) and physicochemical properties (e.g.foaming and emulsifying capacitiy) suggested that there are potentials to apply fish protein hydrolysates (FPHs) in pharmaceutical, nutritional and food industries [68].Besides the enzymatic method [69,70], chemical extraction method can also be used for FPHs production [71].It is possible to tailor a hydrolysate of a desired molecular weight range for specific functional properties by manipulating the enzymatic reaction parameters e.g.enzyme type, pH, time, substrates [72].

Fish protein concentrate (FPC) is processed through solvent extraction, centrifugation, drying and grinding.There are three types of FPC, namely, Type A (no taste, odor, maximum fat content 0.75 %), Type B (no restriction to taste, odor), Type C (simply fish meal but no pathogenic organisms) [36,73].FPC protein when succinylated demonstrates greater emulsion capacity and stability than gelatin [74].FPC can be used for fortification of different foods e.g.biscuit [75].


#### Fish albumins

Apart from fish mucle, albumins can also be extracted from blood.In case of blood, approximately 60 % of the total plasma proteins are albumins [76].Fish albumins are of two grades: (i) technical grade; (ii) food and pharmaceutical grade.As stabilizing, suspending or whipping agent, food grade albumins are used in soup powder, bakery and confectionery products, mayonnaise, ice cream, custard powder, puddings [37].Fish albumin capsules can be used as medication for postoperative and stroke patients [77].Channa striata, Nemipterus japonicus, Chanos chanos, Rastrelliger kanagurta, Lates calcarifer fishes can be used for albumins production [78][79][80][81].Albumins can also be produced from fish scrap [37].


#### Fish meal and fish scrap

In fish meal production, about 90 % of raw material come from sardine, anchovy, capelin and menhaden and rest 10 % are from trash fishes or waste meals.Fishmeal processing steps are cooking, press drying and milling [36,82].Three methods that used to remove objectionable odor from fish meal plant are masking, water scrubbing with or without sodium hypochlorite or potassium permanganate or ozone and incineration [36].Non-grinded fish meal is fish scrap.

Traditionally fish meal and fish oil are produced simultaneously.In 2018 about 18 million tons fishes were processed for fish oil and fish meal production.About 63 %, 25 % and 8 % of total produced fish meal are used as aquaculture feed, pig feed and poultry feed, respectively [83].Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations has forecasted that, by 2030 fish meal and fish oil production will be increased by 1 % and 7 %, respectively than 2018 and use of waste meal as raw material will be increased [4].


#### Fish oil, biofuel

Fish body oil contains health beneficial ω-3 fatty acids.Fish oil is a critical ingredient of farm animal feed, especially in aquafeeed [27], drugs for body lipid regulation e.g.Lovaza, Omtryg, Vascepa and Epanova [84], nutraceutical products for bone joint health [27], cosmetics, cooking oil, margarine, lubricants, ore flotation, rubber, leather tanning, candles, industrial coatings, paints, water repellents, soaps, caulking compounds and putty [85].Every year about 120,000 ton fish oil is produced in EU [86].With help of catalyst (e.g.H 2 SO 4 , CH 3 ONa) purified fish oil can be transesterfied to produce biofuel [87,88].Fish body oil is extracted by wet pressing and solvent extraction [36,89].Fish processing waste can also be used as feedstock for fish oil production [90].


### Fishbone products

Fish calcium powder can be used against calcium deficiency and to improve bone health.To date two fish calcium processing methods have been described-tuna backbones are treated with 10 % calcium carbonate [91] and tilapia bones are treated with NaOH [92], then washed with water, dried and finally, to attain required mesh size, bones are pulverized.Fishbone biochar can be used for degradation of organic pollutants, absorption and removal of antibiotics, azo dyes, heavy metals and as activated carbon [93].Fish scale biochar is also applicable to purify water containing dyes and metal cations [94].


### Multisource-derived products

Collagen, gelatin and glue can be extracted from different body components i.e. skin, bone and scale of fish.Likewise, biopolymer, biofilm, bioplastic and biopackaging products can be processed from more than one sources i.e., fish scale, chitin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin and myofibrillar protein.So, collagen, gelatin, glue, biopolymer, biofilm, bioplastic and biopackaging products have been termed as multisource-derived products.


#### Fish collagen, gelatin, glue

Unlike collagen from pig skin and cattle bones, fish collagen is free from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and owes less or no religious and ethical concerns [95].Collagen is a multifunctional protein e.g.high porosity, low immunogenicity, able to penetrate a lipid-free interface [96].Collagen inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and show anti-inflammatory function [97].The main applications of collagen are drug delivery systems, controlling material for transdermal and gene delivery, collagen-based sponges for wounds and fundamental matrices for cell culture systems, tissue engineering, food and cosmetics industries [95,98].

Production of fishbone collagen include the following steps-i) lipid removal from bones with acetone at ambient temperature for 12 h and dried; ii) decalcification-Hydrochloric acid treatment for 24 h; iii) hydrolysis-Addition of B. subtilis protease to the supernatant (60 • C, pH 8, 1 h); iv) filtration and lyophilization [99].Approximately 15 % of fish wet weight are found as backbone wastes in Atlantic cod fillet processing.Bone tissue contains 35-40 % extracellular organic matrix by weight, of which 90-95 % is type I collagen with other noncollagenous compounds [100].Collagen extraction from scales includes decalcification and pepsin digestion [27].Another method is demineralization using EDTA and dissolve in acetic acid [101].Bone collagen is acid-soluble collagen (ASC), whereas scale derived collagen is pepsin-soluble collagen (PSC).Both types of collagens can be extracted from fish skin e.g.black drum fish (Pogonias cromis) (Fig. 4) [27].

Other collagen extraction methods are deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction [102], supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) [103], extrusion and ultrasound-assisted extraction [104].Apart from acid and pepsin solubilization, through salt solubilization collagen type I, II, IX, and XI can be produced from fish cartilage [105].Fish fins can also be used for collagen production [106].

Hydrolyzed form of collagen is gelatin.Thermo-reversible gelation behavior, water holding, emulsification, thickening, film formation, crystallization control, colloid stabilization, whipping properties of gelatin are utilized in food, pharmaceutical, and photographic film industries.Commercial gelatins possess bloom strength-300 bloom and viscosity-15 and 75 mP.Fish maws are excellent raw material for high-grade fish gelatin production [42].Gelatin extraction process includes treatment of fish skins and bones with NaOH, H 2 SO 4 , and citric acid, washing between all treatments, repeat this whole process 3 times, final extraction-skin and bone soaked in 45 • C distilled water for 12 h (skin, bone and distilled water ratio is 1 kg: 3 kg), filtration of obtained extract, vacuum oven drying, milling and packed in air tight container [107].A further improvised method was described later by Koli et al. (2013) [108].

Gelatin differs from fish glue.Gelatin is a very high-grade product, has high jelly strength, light in color, gives reasonably clear solutions, tastes sweet, and does not contain excessive impurities, whereas fish glue is inferior quality product than gelain [109].Glue prepared from tilapia scale and skin, and croaker wastes has already been reported [110].


#### Biopolymer, biofilm, bioplastic and biopackaging

Fish scale, chitin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin and myofibrillar protein can be used to produce biopolymer [111,112].Due to negative impacts of chemically synthetic plastics on environment, since the last decade production and market for bioplastics is incessantly expanding and getting diversified [113].Araújo et al. ( 2018) described method to manufacture bioplastic from myofibrillar protein [114].

Edible biopolymer films and coatings of gelatin can be used for fish and meat biopackaging for the following properties i.e. sensory acceptance, functional characteristics (biodegradability), optical (opaqueness and brightness) properties, mechanical attributes (tension, flexibility), structural resistance to water, gas and microorganisms, cost and availability [115].Chemical treatments such as acylation, esterification, deamination, cross-linking, and reactions with acids and bases significantly alter the physical and chemical properties of gelatin [116].Industrially collagen is using in edible casings in meat processing industries (sausages, salami) [117,118].

For biopackaging purpose, myofibrillar protein/muscle proteins can be wrapped, coated or sprayed over foods [113].Kaewprachu et al. (2016) reported that myofibrillar protein film defend UV light more efficiently than commercial polyvinyl chloride wrap films [119].Fish myofibrillar proteins can be used for encapsulation of nutraceuticals such as vitamins, probiotics, bioactive peptides and antioxidants.Such carrier matrices could be hydrogel, micro or nanoparticles [120].The properties of muscle protein-derived polymer films found in the existing literature are summarized in Table 2. Technological properties of biofilm produced from mixture of gelatin and fish myofibrillar proteins are also feasible for food packaging [121].

Fernando et al. ( 2016) described processing method for polymer films manufactured from chitin [126].Chitosan is an excellent candidate for food packaging applications [113].Chitosan polymer blends e.g.chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose films demonstrate high mechanical performances, low water solubility and water vapor permeability [127,127,128].Gelatin [129], myofibrillar protein [130], and chitin, chitosan [131] based biofilms can also be used in active packaging.


### Whole fish products 2.9.1. Fish silage

Fish silage was first produced in Sweden in the 1930s [132].Higher protein, lipid and mineral content were found in fish silage processed from fish waste than in whole fish.Considering the amino acid profile, similar to fishmeal, high levels of lysine, threonine and sulphur-containing amino acids are found in fish silage.Fish silage is a less expensive protein source than fishmeal and fish oil.Use of fish silage in aquaculture and pet-food industry is increasing.It can also be used as livestock feed [133].In fish silage, protein is hydrolyzed naturally, so it has the potential to increase growth and decrease mortality of farmed animals [134].Fish silage can be prepared by two ways: i) acid silage; ii) fermented silage (Table 3).Acid silage is most commonly used.Acid silage processing is shown in Fig. 5 [36].T: Thickness; TS = Tensile strength; EAB: Elongation at break; WVP: Water vapor permeability, S: Solubility.


## Md.S.I. Sarkar et al.

Recent reports by FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations) on fish silage in Bangladesh, Thailand, Philippines, and Barbados, Saint Kitts and Nevis illustrated that, feasibility of production and utilization varies according to country-wise context.In Bangladesh, seafood processors have abilty to supply waste material and there is a demand of fish waste from feed processors.So, Bangladesh has potential for fish silage production.Fish waste is usually landfilled in Barbados.To prevent this loss, multiple channels of supply chain have been developed.Similarly, supply chains reconfiguration have been proposed for Saint Kitts and Nevis.In the Phillipines, fish silage technology is efficient to maximize waste utilization and this is particularly important for coastal areas where there are no existing facilities for waste utilization.In the Thialnd, local small communities are interested to produce fish silage for animal feed [139].


#### Pet food, wet feed

Fish is canned to use as pet food.In some countries, pet food industry is a major user of industrial fish supplies.Customers pay higher price for pet food than fish meal but due to low cost of raw material, this product is comparatively cheaper than other meatbased foods.Whole fish is thoroughly grounded to crash sharp bones and based on customer demand, color and consistency of the food, other ingredients are mixed.A formula for fish-based pet food preparation has been shown in Table 4 [36].

Wet feed can be defiend as, fish/filleting waste, shrimp waste, binding powder and vitamin mix are coarsely minced together and   fed by hand.Wet diets are used in aquaculture e.g.salmon and trout culture in Northern Europe and mink farming.Usually capelin, sprats, and sand-eels are used to manufacture wet feed.


#### Fish fertilizer, compost and biogas

Fish or fish waste can be converted into stable solid, liquid fertilizers and compost in combination with other materials.At present, such fertilizers and composts are bearing great significance for organic farming practice.Fish fertilizer contains well-balanced nutrients for growth of crops [140] (Table 5).

Based on processing methods, several terms are used to mean fish fertilizer products such as hydrolyzed waste/fish hydrolysate, fish silage, fish solubles/fish emulsion, fish meal, fish powder, and fish soluble nutrients [140].According to the type of material, the processing steps vary.Basic processing steps are crushing, heating, centrifugation/pressing, liquid and solid separation, drying up the solids, and finally, crushing to the desirable particle size [144].

Fish silage can be modified into fishbone meal, fish meal or fish powder through further drying and used as fertilizers, or to make compost which can be mixed with other materials [140].Fishbone meal or fish meal can be incorporated in liquid and solid fertilizer products [145].Ahuja et al. (2020) provided list of commercially available fertilizers available in market [140].Some fish waste composts are summarized in Table 6.Biogas production through anaerobic co-digestion of fish waste and cattle manure, and vegetable waste collected from market has been reported [140,146].

In Alaska, fish compost is permissible to use in land if the following conditions are met: i) depend on the amount of waste involved, a composting operation may require permission from authority; ii) compost can not be used within 100 feet of a well producing drinking water; iii) compost particle should be less than 2 inches in diameter; iv) compost has to be treated in a way so that number of Salmonella, fecal Coliform conforms with Class A requirement for pathogen reduction at the time of application; v) applied at or below level of nitrogen fertilizer uses for vegetation that will be cultivated on that land; vi) compost should be used in land in such a manner that does not produce objectionable odor or attract animals or other vectors; vii) as a result of surface run-off compost used in the land must not violate water quality standards in waterbodies [150].


### Rinse water recovery products

It is possible to recover protein and lipid from wash water from fish processing plant [52,151].Extracted proteins can be utilized as animal feed.If per hour 30 tons of water containing 1.5 % oil passes through the strainer, more than 720 tons of oil will be produced every year and 70 % recovery of that oil is sufficient to outweigh the processing cost.This is also an important approach to deal with high biological oxygen demand (BOD) of municipal sewage systems [52].It is reported that, pyrolysis of brown grease produces high-value specialty solvents and high cetane alkane-based fuels [152].


## Industrial utilization conceptual model

In an industrial plant fish body parts should be utilized sequentially as illustrated in the following conceptual model (Fig. 6).


## Considerations on use of fish waste as raw material

Studies have been conducted over last 100 years in attempt to valorize fish waste through conversion of waste into products such as fish protein concentrates, fish oil, and fish meal.Techno-econo-environmental issues should be considered in utilization of fish waste as raw material.These considerations are also important to evaluate feasibility of products development in industrial-scale from lowvalue or from fish species which are less preferred for human consumption.Although in the Scotland due to cheap disposal cost, fish wastes are not generally considered for other applications, but on the other hand, Norway is an exemplary country that has been utilizing seafood waste efficiently [153].Cristóbal et al. (2018) investigated potato, tomato, citrus fruits and olive waste valorization pathways in European level and found that only some particular pathways are economically profitable where market price of the produced products and economies of scale greatly function as a determinant of profitability [154].From fish waste, various products describes in the previous section of this article can be produced and as these products has important applications in medical, pharmaceutical, cosmeceuticals, food, packaging, animal feed industries, so, some fish waste valorization pathways has potential to be economically profitable.

Amount of waste generated and proximity to processing plant also determine economic feasibility.Available literature suggests that considerably large amount of fish waste biomass is produced by fish and shellfish processing operations.It was reported that in fin fish processing operations, 25-50 % of the raw material is genrally discarded as waste and in case of freshwater fishes such as carp, trout, bream and pike, quantity of discarded portion is high and constitutes about 40-60 % [155].Every year about 80,000 MT and 100,000 MT shellfish waste is produced by the India and EU, respectively [156,157].Steinke and Barjenbruch (2010) reported that, a herring processing factory of 50,000 MT production capacity releases 1,500 m 3 wastewater daily [158].Careful logistics management is a great challenge to supply fish waste to processing plant where waste will be processed into products.The first obstacle is to gather sufficient amount of fish waste at a time [159] and the other constrain is to maintain acceptable microbiological quality [160].Bottani et al. (2019) suggested to store food waste in distribution center for long duration to optimize supply chain [161].Frozen storage is an effective way to control microbial quality of fish waste [153].A well-coordinated collection and transportation network able to maintain cool chain should be designed to feed the industry.In India, to reduce post-harvest loss of fish during marketing, three-wheeler vehicle (known as Rickshaw) has been modified with addition of a trolley.The trolley was made with fibre reinforced plastics (FRP), so required less physical effort to run and ergonomic.This trolley consisted of insulated ice box, fish storage chamber, fish dressing workspace and water tank [162].Such electric power driven motor vehicle might be beneficial in transportation of fish waste.Strict hygiene is important in maintenance of fish waste quality [15].Training would be arranged for fish waste handlers.Lack of technology, logistics and understanding the processes regulating waste quality are main barrires against safe management of food wastes.There are no major laws or regulations about utilization of fish waste except the EU Animal By-Product Regulation (ABPR) which prohibits intra-species recycling e.g.salmon waste can not be used as salmon feed.According to strict government regulation in Japan, industries have to further treat fish waste to process fish waste into meal [163].

To identify novel valorization technology(s) in the design phase of establishing a waste valorizing industry based on environmental performance assessment, life cycle assessment (LCA) is most efficient in suggesting possible trade-offs and in selection of best ecofriendly technology.At present LCA studies relevant to products produced from fish waste is very limited.LCA by Monteiro et al.

(2018) suggested that in production of ω-3 lipids from liquid by-products of fish canning industry, among three methods-conventional extraction, high hydrostatic pressure extraction (HHPE), and subcritical water extraction (SWE) employed to extract, HHPE is environmentally and economically efficient than the other two methods [164].In Spain, LCA in management of by-products produced in mussel sector reported that, shell waste valorized into calcium carbonate is more efficient than other alternative disposal options-landfilling and incineration.Similarly, valorization of mussel organic by-product into pâté is recommended than utilization as fish meal.Environmental hot spots identified in these valorization pathways are energy demand, ash and sludge management, atmospheric releases and haulage, and product transport [165].Information in available literature is not sufficient and followed different methodology(s).So, at this point, it is not possible to suggest the most suitable valorization pathways for products described in this article.

Literature available on technology or processes for food waste utilization show three types of approaches: i) laboratory experimentations; ii) pilot plants; iii) industrial plants.It is generally possible to treat 1-10 kg food waste in laboratory condition and among all available technologies only some technologies show success in pilot plants and potential for upgradation to industrial scale, but in industrial-scale just a few techonologies are appropriate [159].Therefore, most technologies reported in this study are in a state of low level of readiness to employ in industrial scale.[166][167][168].For example, behavior of enzyme used in enzyme-assisted extraction is governed by environmental conditions [169].Ultrasonic solvent extraction is limited as ATEX (ATmosphères EXplosives) certification is required to operate this technology.Solvents e.g.ethanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane used in this processing are considered as explosive above 50 L [159].

West Africa and East Asia has international, well-established markets for different organs of fish.At present about 12 companies are working on recycling of fish waste in Scotland [170].Similar instances are found throughout the world e.g.Norway, Canada, Japan, China, USA, Korea and Australia.Existing difficulties and challenges in valorization of fish waste are: i) seasonal abundance of fish and shellfish; ii) many times collection sources of fish waste e.g.fish processing plants, fish markets are located distantly and situated in remote areas, also these sources produce small, economically insignificant amount of waste; iii) lack of technology and low-level readiness of technology for handling, storage and processing; iv) infrastructure to implement new valorization methods; v) financial incentive and support to valorize fish and shellfish waste instead of choosing option for inexpensive disposal; vi) existing waste regulation framework is complicated; vii) documentation, policy and regulation, and authorizations for marketing of fish waste derived products [153].However, strategies that can be followed to deal with the difficulties and challenges are: i) bioresource mapping; ii) strategic action plan for coordination of stakeholders; iii) use of biorefinery technologies; iv) innovation of low-tech processing methods suitable for rural areas in small scale; v) cross-sectoral awareness raising; vi) data management [170].


## Conclusions

It might be possible to set up new fisheries industries by producing different commercially important non-food products from less demanded or low-valued fishes, bycatch/trash fishes or fish processing wastes.More extensive research is required to improve the existing products and create new products.Biorefinery approaches should be considered.Non-food fisheries industries can contribute to poverty eradication and employment in coastal areas.But utilization of fish in such industries might also create conflict with food fish supply; in particular, it can deplete low-valued fishes which are the main animal protein source for root-level people in developing countries.Potential environmental sustainability issues created by these industries e.g.pollution by industries, risk of overfishing, biodiversity loss and ecological imbalance, illegal, unreported, unauthorized fishing, marine pollution should be addressed and resolved.Considering these issues, policies and initiatives at national level such as financing the entrepreneurs, developing skilled human resources through training programs are required to way forward to establish these new types of fisheries industries.Involvement of national and international NGOs and donor agencies in this regard might be very advantageous.Furthermore, international collaborative efforts such as technology transfer from developed to developing countries or technology exchanges are important to establish these new fisheries industries.
