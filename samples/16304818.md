We examine the optical emission line properties of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) selected from two large, homogeneous datasets. The first is the X-ray selected National Optical Astronomy Observatory Fundamental Plane Survey (NFPS), and the second is the C4 catalogue of optically selected clusters built from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR3). Our goal is to better understand the optical line emission in BCGs with respect to properties of the galaxy and the host cluster. Throughout the analysis we compare the line emission of the BCGs to that of a control sample made of the other bright galaxies near the cluster centre. Overall, both the NFPS and SDSS show a modest fraction of BCGs with emission lines (∼ 15%). No trend in the fraction of emitting BCGs as a function of galaxy mass or cluster velocity dispersion is found. However we find that, for those BCGs found in cooling flow clusters, 71 +9 −14 have optical emission. Furthermore, if we consider only BCGs within 50kpc of the X-ray centre of a cooling flow cluster, the emission-line fraction rises further to 100 +0 −15 %. Excluding the cooling flow clusters, only ∼ 10 % of BCGs are line emitting, comparable to the control sample of galaxies. We show that the physical origin of the emission line activity varies: in some cases it has LINERlike line ratios, whereas in others it is a composite of star-formation and LINER-like activity. We conclude that the presence of emission lines in BCGs is directly related to the cooling of X-ray gas at the cluster centre.

# INTRODUCTION

The brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is typically a giant, red elliptical or cD galaxy, located near the centre of the gravitational potential. It is likely that a rich history of galaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers is responsible for the unique morphology of such galaxies. This is supported indirectly by several pieces of evidence, including: the luminosity of the BCG is correlated with the cluster mass (Scott 1957;) and X-ray luminosity (Hudson & Ebeling 1997); BCGs in the most X-ray luminous clusters are larger and have surface brightness profiles which are less steep than their low X-ray luminosity counterparts (Brough et al. 2005); and the velocity dispersion of BCGs rises less steeply with luminosity than for other bright galaxies (von der . All this indirect evidence for a rich merger history is supported by high resolution imaging of BCGs obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, which has revealed that the cores of these galaxies can be complex, often showing multiple nuclei and prominent dust signatures (Laine et al. 2003).

However, the evolutionary history of these galaxies is still not completely understood, and work on cooling flow (CF) clusters has hinted at another possible mechanism for adding to the stellar mass of BCG. The original cooling flow hypothesis is that hot cluster X-ray gas cools and condenses out of the intracluster medium (ICM) into the cluster's potential well, forming molecular clouds and stars (Fabian 1994). This drop-out occurs at the centre of the cooling flow, within the cooling radius, ie. onto the BCG. Cooling flow clusters are common in the local universe (making up about 50% of the population in an Xray flux limited sample Peres et al. 1998;Chen et al. 2007)), and cD galaxies are often found at the centre of these systems. Because of this, a link between the cooling Xray gas and recent star formation in the BCG has been discussed for many years (Fabian 1994). Convincing observations which support this idea have been presented: a blue and UV-colour excess (McNamara et al. 1996Hicks & Mushotzky 2005), molecular gas (Edge et al. 2002;Jaffe et al. 2001;Salomé & Combes 2003) and Hα emission (Crawford et al. 1999;Donahue et al. 2000;Crawford et al. 2005) have all been seen in the cooling flow cluster's BCG. However, although the morphology of the Hα emission is diffuse and filamentary, indicating star formation in some CF BCGs, in others it is very compact and more characteristic of AGN dominated emission (Donahue et al. 2000;Edwards & Robert 2007;Hatch 2007). As well, von der Linden et al. (2006) recently showed that optical emission lines in BCGs predominantly arise from LINER emission, rather than normal star formation.

More recent X-ray satellite measurements from Chandra and XMM have shown that the gas does not cool directly from the hot X-ray phase through to the cool molecular gas phase (Böhringer et al. 2002), but rather that a large amount of the cooling gas is being reheated before condensing out of the ICM. The current paradigm is that AGN activity in the BCG is reheating the cooling X-ray gas, which implies a more complicated feedback process between the cooling gas and the central galaxy (e.g Pizzolato & Soker 2005). This leads to revised, predicted mass deposition rates that are now in reasonable agreement with the observed values (Böhringer et al. 2002;Pizzolato & Soker 2005). The observed molecular and ionic gas may be attributed to a small amount that has cooled from the cooling flow; alternatively, the Hα may be excited by the AGN itself. Detailed studies of star formation indicators in galaxy groups and clusters in cooling flows and non-cooling flows, discriminating between those with and without AGN activity, are required in order to analyze the relative importance of the different processes.

A correlation between optical line emission in the BCG and cluster properties has been explored by several authors, most notably Crawford et al. (1999), who found that 27% of BCGs have optical line emission, and that the projected distance from the BCG to the X-ray centre is less for line emitting galaxies than for non-emitting galaxies. Recently, von der Linden et al. (2006) and Best et al. (2006) have explored the properties of BCGs in the SDSS, using the C4 cluster catalogue (Miller et al. 2005). These authors find that radio-loud AGN activity is more frequent in BCGs than in other galaxies of the same mass, but that this frequency does not depend strongly on cluster velocity dispersion. On the other hand, in their study of radio-loud properties of an X-ray selected cluster sample, Lin & Mohr (2006) find the overall radio-loud fraction to be 30% in BCGs, and that the fraction is higher in more massive clusters. Importantly, von der  find that many of these radioloud galaxies would not necessarily be identified as AGN from their optical emission lines and, in fact, that optical AGN activity appears to be less frequent among BCGs than other cluster galaxies of similar mass. The interpretation is complicated by the fact that the radio-selected galaxy sample, though restricted to red galaxies, could be contaminated by galaxies in which the low luminosity radio emission arises from star formation, rather than AGN activity.

In this paper, we explore optical line emission in BCGs with respect to properties of the galaxy and the host cluster, using two large, homogeneous datasets. One sample is taken from the X-ray selected, National Optical Astronomy Observatory Fundamental Plane Survey (NFPS), for which the X-ray properties are known for all clusters. For many of these clusters, we are able to identify those with short cooling times (CF clusters) based on ROSAT, Chandra, or XMM-Newton observations. We complement this sample with optically-selected clusters drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR3), which is not biased toward X-ray luminous clusters, and is therefore more representative of the cluster population. In addition, the greater spectral coverage of the SDSS allows us to use emission line ratios to identify whether the emission arises predominantly from composite HII region and LINER activity, or from LINER activity alone (pure HII-region, and Seyfert-like emission are both rare).

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce our galaxy samples and selection criteria. In section 3, we report our results. For the X-ray selected NFPS we compare the frequency of Hβ emission in BCGs as a function of BCG magnitude and distance to the cluster centre. Similar results are found for the SDSS sample, based on the Hα emission line. However, we find that there are differences between the BCGs in the two samples, which we can attribute to the nature of the X-ray emitting gas. In section 4, we consider the impact of our results on various galaxy and cluster formation hypotheses, and summarize our results. We conclude in section 5. Unless otherwise stated our analysis assumes the values Ωm=0.3, for the matter density parameter, ΩΛ=0.7 for the cosmological constant, and H0=100 km/s/Mpc for the Hubble parameter. LX refers to the bolometric X-ray luminosity throughout.


# DATA AND SAMPLE SELECTION

For both NFPS and SDSS, our goal is to identify the BCG and a similar sample of luminous "control" galaxies that is located in the inner regions of the cluster. We first discuss the sample selection of the NFPS.


## NOAO Fundamental Plane Survey

The NFPS is an all sky study of 93 X-ray selected rich clusters with redshifts between 0.010 and 0.067 (Smith et al. 2004). The goals of the project are to measure cosmic flows on the scales of 100 h −1 Mpc and to build a large homogeneous sample with which to investigate physical effects and environmental influences on early-type galaxy evolution and formation (Smith et al. 2004). The spectroscopic observations are made though a fiber diameter of 2" and are limited to red sequence galaxies; galaxies more than 0.2 magnitudes bluer than the red sequence were not generally observed spectroscopically. There are spectra for 5388 galaxies with a wavelength coverage between 4000 and 6100Å and a resolution of ∼ 3Å (Smith et al. 2004).


### Cluster, BCG, and Control Sample Definitions

In order to respect the completeness of the NFPS cluster sample, we exclude the 13 clusters that were observed serendipitously and that did not meet the original LX limit of 10 42.6 erg/s. For each cluster, the redshifts were used to calculate the cluster velocity dispersion and the radius at which the mean density interior to the cluster is 200 times the critical density (σ cl and r200, respectively). We used the prescription r200= √ 3σ cl /1000 km/s/Mpc as derived in Carlberg et al. (1997). Note that r200 is typically of order 1.5 h −1 Mpc, much larger than the cooling radius of a typical cooling-flow cluster (about 200 kpc). The centre of the cluster is taken to be at the peak of the X-ray emission (Ebeling et al. 1996(Ebeling et al. , 2000. The galaxies are then assigned to the clusters based on a radial and a velocity weighting as in Smith et al. (2004). For this analysis, we are interested in only the bright galaxies in the central regions of the cluster and so include a magnitude limit of MK < −24, based on K-band total magnitudes obtained from 2MASS catalogues (Skrutskie et al. 2006). This is about half a magnitude brighter than the characteristic K-band magnitude of MK * = −23.55 , for H0 = 100 km/s/Mpc). Since we are interested only in galaxies occupying a similar environment as the BCG, ie. in the central regions of the cluster, we consider only galaxies within 0.5r200, and with velocity differences with respect to the cluster mean velocity less than twice the cluster velocity dispersion.

The BCG is then defined as the first rank cluster galaxy using the K-band magnitudes. In twenty cases, the BCG was not observed spectroscopically due to constraints in the fiber positioning, and these clusters have been excluded from our analysis. Our final sample consists of 60 clusters with BCGs, as summarized in Table 1 and listed in Table 2. Our control sample consists of the 159 other bright (MK < −24) galaxies within the same radial and velocity cuts described above. The BCGs are, of course, excluded from the control sample.

For the NFPS, we use the stellar absorption-corrected Hβ emission as an indicator of star formation activity, since Hα is not generally available in these spectra. Although Hβ emission is relatively weak, the high signal-to-noise ratio of these spectra allow us to measure its strength reliably after correcting for underlying stellar absorption (see the errors quoted in Table 2). The observed galaxy spectra are divided by best fit absorption template stellar population synthesis models from Vazdekis (1999), which have been redshifted and broadened to match the velocity dispersion of the observed galaxy. Subsequently, the Hβ equivalent width is measured directly, without assuming a particular line profile, from the ratio of the observed spectrum to the best fit model (Nelan et al. 2005). A thorough discussion of the emission line measurements can be found in Nelan et al. (2005). For two of the NFPS BCGs, in Abell 780 and in Abell 1795, the nebular emission is strong enough that our standard methods for obtaining reliable velocity dispersions, and hence stellar absorption corrections, fail. For galaxies of similar magnitude, the typical stellar absorption at Hβ is ∼1.5Å with an uncertainty of 0.3Å. This error dominates our uncertainity in the total equivalent width of emission for these two special cases. For the BCGs in Abell 780 and Abell 1795, the Hβ equivalent widths are 7.8Å and 7.2Å, respectively. However, to achieve a plot that is more eas-ily read, these points are set to respective lower limits of 3.3Å and 3.7Å in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.

We will define emission-line galaxies to be those with an equivalent width > 0.5Å. Since the Hα and [Nii] lines are generally unavailable, we are unable to use Baldwin et al. (1981, hereafter BPT) diagrams to reliably distinguish emission due to star formation from that arising from AGN activity.


### Cooling Flow definition

In general, we designate an NFPS cluster as "cooling flow" (CF) or "non-cooling flow" using mass deposition rates and X-ray cooling times from published catalogues (Peres et al. 1998;White 2000;Allen et al. 2001;Bîrzan et al. 2004). This is a somewhat subjective classification complicated by the fact that not only are mass deposition rates calculated from ROSAT observations typically 2-10 times higher than those calculated from Chandra observations (Böhringer et al. 2002), but also higher resolution spectra from XMM Newton are not well matched to an isobaric cooling model (Peterson et al. 2003); thus the mass deposition rate may not be an exact indicator of a cooling flow cluster. Therefore, whenever possible, we prefer to use recent cooling flow designations based on the presence of a central temperature gradient in XMM Newton or Chandra observations. For the rest, we are left with using the mass deposition rate based on ROSAT data as an indicator. For the 11 cases where observations are from the Chandra or XMM Newton satellites, we define a CF cluster to be one with a mass deposition rateṀ > 0; otherwise, we requirė M > 100M ⊙ yr −1 . Within this framework we have 14 CF clusters and 19 non-CF clusters. The CF status of another 27 clusters is unknown. Clearly this is not an unassailable definition; however, it is likely that most, if not all, of the clusters we classify as CF clusters really do have short cooling times in the centre. Some galaxies with low mass deposition rates will undoubtedly fall in our non-CF sample. With this in mind, our results are not sensitive to this definition. We further discuss this point in Section 3.1, as well as a continuous method of defining a CF cluster, based on an excess of observed X-ray luminosity to predicted values (McCarthy et al. 2004).


## Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

Our second sample of galaxy clusters is derived from the C4 catalogue (Miller et al. 2005), based on the third data release (DR3) of the SDSS. This release covers 5282 square degrees in imaging, and 4188 square degrees in spectroscopy (Abazajian et al. 2005). Imaging was taken in five optical bands, u', g', r', i' and z' with a median spatial resolution of 1.4" in r'. Spectra are observed with a aperture diameter of 3", cover the wavelength range from 3800 to 9200 A and have a spectral resolution of ∼3Å in r'. Redshifts measured from these spectra are accurate to ∼ 30 km/s (Abazajian et al. 2005). The Hα line strengths are measured by fitting gaussians to the line profile in a standard pipeline (Stoughton et al. 2002). For W•(Hα) > 5Å, the equivalent width uncertainty is less than 20%. For weaker lines, W•(Hα) < 5Å the errors are known to be large (Gómez et al. 2003). We have made no correction to the emission-line strengths for underlying stellar absorption. For our purposes this is safe to neglect because, whereas even a modest star formation rate generates considerable Hα emission, the stellar absorption doesn't vary by more than ∼ 1Å for moderately old populations.

As described in Miller et al. (2005), clusters and groups are identified as overdensities in the multi-dimensional space spanned by position, redshift, and five-colour photometry. There are 1106 clusters identified in the SDSS DR3 using this algorithm. We further select objects with redshifts z < 0.10, to minimize the incompleteness of the sample. In order to reduce the number of clusters with uncertain velocity dispersions, we exclude clusters flagged as having significant substructure. Specifically we include only clusters flagged as SUB=0, ie. those for which the ratio of the standard deviation of the cluster velocity dispersion profile to the mean cluster velocity dispersion is less than 15 (Miller et al. 2005). This reduces the number of clusters in our sample to 825.


### Cluster, BCG, and Control Definitions

For the SDSS we define the BCG and clusters in as close a manner as possible to the NFPS case. Again, the BCG is the brightest galaxy in the K band (and with MK < −24), within half of r200 of the geometric centre of the cluster, and within two times the cluster velocity dispersion. However, the geometric centres we use are different than those in the C4 catalogue. We start with the C4 catalogue geometric centres measured using the luminosity weighted position average of all the galaxies within 1Mpc and four times the velocity dispersion. As this definition encompasses such a large area, multiple substructures along the line of sight heavily influence the position of the centre. For example, the geometric centre will be placed in between two obvious subclumps. Thus, we iteratively recalculate a luminosityweighted centre using only galaxies within two times the cluster velocity dispersion, and with magnitude MK < −24.

Due to the incomplete spectral coverage of the central galaxies, there are 154 cases in which the brightest cluster galaxy had not been observed spectroscopically. We exclude these clusters from the sample. To ensure this is not introducing an important bias, we verified that the subset of BCGs observed in the photometric catalogue but not in the spectroscopic catalogue have an equivalent (u ′ − r ′ ) colour distribution to those in our final, spectroscopic sample. Finally, we also remove those clusters whose geometric centres are within 15' of a survey boundary, as well as those with measured velocity dispersions greater than 1200 km/s. The latter restriction is made because such high values are usually a result of significant contamination from line-of-sight substructure. These selections leave us with a final sample of 328 BCGs.

Our control sample is built from the other bright galaxies near the centre of the clusters, as in the NFPS case. In order to increase the size of our control sample, we include clusters where the brightest central galaxy was not measured spectroscopically. There are 526 control galaxies in 353 groups and clusters with a velocity dispersion less than 1200km/s. We note that the number of control galaxies per cluster is significantly larger in the X-ray luminosity selected NFPS clusters, probably because they are richer than the optically-selected SDSS clusters.

Because the centres of the NFPS clusters are based on the X-ray centroid, whereas in the SDSS the geometric centre is used, it is important to compare the two definitions. In order to find X-ray centers for the SDSS clusters, we have matched them to X-ray cluster catalogues including: NORAS , REFLEX (Böhringer et al. 2001), BAX (Sadat et al. 2004), XBACS (Ebeling et al. 1996), RASSCALS (Mahdavi et al. 2000), as well as Popesso et al. (2004); Mulchaey & Zabludoff (1998) and Horner et al. (2001). Most of the cluster catalogues are based on ROSAT observations, where the flux limit is high. This restricts our sample of SDSS clusters with X-ray detections to the small subset of massive clusters at z < 0.03. There are 35 X-ray cluster matches, ie. cases where the Xray centre is within half of r200 of one of our 328 SDSS clusters. Fig. 1 shows that for most of the matched clusters, there is good agreement between the X-ray and geometric centres. However, also depicted in the figure is how some cases exhibit differences of up to 0.5 Mpc, especially for lower mass clusters. It is unlikely that this is caused by an uncertainty in the X-ray centres, as the centres of the NO-RAS, BCS, and XBACS samples were found by determining the two-dimensional centre of mass using the Voronoi Tessellation and Percolation method (Ebeling & Wiedenmann 1993), and are generally accurate to about 1' (Ebeling et al. 1998), corresponding to ∼ 90 kpc at z ∼ 0.08. More likely, is that the geometric centers do not trace the gravitation potential of the cluster as well as the X-ray centres. We note that for many of the cases in which the centres are discrepant by > 200 kpc, the geometric centre appears to be contaminated by in-falling groups; which is not surprising as it is measured using a typical line of sight projection of ∼ 3 Mpc (for σ = 500km/s).


### Emission Line diagnostics

Optical emission line galaxies in the SDSS are identified from the Hα line, which is the line in our wavelength range that is most sensitive to star formation activity. To ensure a fair comparison with the NFPS, we must choose a threshold in Hα equivalent width that is comparable to the Hβ limit used in that survey. Recall that the lines are measured using different techniques, from spectra of different resolution and signal-to-noise, and obtained with different fibres; furthermore, the NFPS Hβ measurements are corrected for underlying stellar absorption, while the SDSS Hα lines are not. Therefore we opt for an empirical "calibration" between the two, by plotting the NFPS Hβ equivalent widths against the SDSS Hα equivalent widths, for galaxies that appear in both surveys (Fig. 2). Although there is plenty of scatter, there is a strong correlation between the two lines, and we find the Hα index is about four times larger than the Hβ; encouragingly, this is comparable to the factor of 4.5 derived by comparing the Hα/Hβ ratio for the subset galaxies in the NFPS for which measurements of both emission lines are available (Nelan et al. 2005). Thus, an Hα equivalent width cut of 2Å is comparable to an Hβ equivalent width of 0.5Å, and the fraction of galaxies in our samples above either of these thresholds is similar. Note that the points at W•(Hα) = 0 are non-detections (plotted with the aver- Cluster velocity dispersion as a function of the difference in the X-ray and geometric centres for the 35 SDSS BCGs that have available X-ray positions. The clusters with large discrepancies between the two centres are generally found to have geometric centres highly influenced by in-falling groups.

age uncertainty of 0.15Å), and those with W•(Hα < 0) are detected in absorption. We have experimented with SDSS Hα equivalent width cuts of 2±1Å and find that our final results do not change significantly. The good correlation also gives us additional confidence in the template correction used to correct the Hβ equivalent widths for stellar absorption, which is relatively much more important here than for Hα (the average stellar absorption strength is ∼ 1Å, with variations at the ∼ 0.15Å level). Due to the proximity of the galaxies in our sample and the finite fiber size though which they are observed, the amount of extended line emission could be underestimated. However, as we do not know if the emission is extended we have not explicitly accounted for the finite fiber size, nor for the difference in fiber diameters between two surveys. Here again, we argue that the effect on the line strength measurements is calibrated by our use of an empirical relation.

Hα line emission may arise from either ionization by hot stars, or ionization from AGN activity. We use the AGN classification taken from the emission-line analysis discussed in Kauffmann et al. (2003), which is based on Hα/[Nii] and [Oiii]/Hβ diagnostic ratios, which separates AGN, star-forming, and composite (intermediate between star-forming and AGN) regions on BPT diagrams. Table  1 shows that, in our SDSS sample, ∼ 65 % of galaxies with emission have line ratios consistent with AGN or composite emission, and this fraction may be somewhat higher for the BCG population, relative to the control galaxies. Using Ho et al. (1997) to separate Seyferts from LINERs, along with the Kauffmann et al. (2003) definitions, we find that ∼ 33% of emitting SDSS BCGs can be reliably measured as LINERs, ∼ 27% as composite; Seyfert-like emission is negligible ( ∼ 3%). If we assume the ionizing source for the HII regions is stellar, and that all of the Hα emission is within the fibre diameter, then typical Hα luminosities of our emitting BCGs correspond to star formation rates of ∼ 0.5 to ∼ 1.6 M ⊙ yr −1 (Kennicutt 1998). Fig. 3 shows the distribution of Hα equivalent width as a function of (u ′ − r ′ ) colour. Following Strateva & Knapp (2001), we use the value of 2.2 for the (u ′ − r ′ ) colour separation of blue and red galaxies. As the NFPS galaxies are red selected, we include a corresponding colour cut of (u ′ − r ′ ) > 2.2 for the SDSS galaxies when directly comparing to the NFPS results (as in Section 3). This colour cut excludes 10 of the 328 SDSS BCGs (only one with X-ray data) as well as 53 control galaxies. As seen in Fig. 3, most BCGs are redder than this cut whether or not they show optical emission. Thus, if the line emission is due to star formation, it does not dominate the global colours of these BCGs, which are presumably quite old. Because of this, results based on BCGs in the NFPS are not likely to be affected by the colour cut in that sample. For the control sample, most of the emission-line galaxies are bluer than our cut. Therefore we expect the fraction of control galaxies with emission, as presented in Section 3, to be biased low relative to the BCGs. This is evident from Table 1: in the red-selected SDSS sample, the overall fraction of emission line galaxies is similar (∼ 11 %) for both control galaxies and BCGs, while for the unrestricted sample the fraction of control galaxies with emission is ∼ 18%. This difference is not large enough to affect any of our conclusions in Section 3, however.


### Galaxy Colour


# RESULTS

In this section we examine the line emission in the galaxies in our cluster samples as a function of X-ray luminosity, Kband magnitude, and distance from the centre of the cluster. The numbers of emission-line galaxies in both surveys are given in column 4 of Table 1. There is a higher fraction of emitting galaxies among the NFPS BCGs; 20±6% are emitting, compared to only 9±2% of the controls. If we look only at those BCGs identified with a CF cluster we find an even higher fraction of them show emission, 71 +9 −14 , while the control sample is unchanged (14±6%). On the other hand, only 11±2% of the red BCGs selected from the SDSS sample show emission, comparable to that of the control population (11±2%). In this section we will explore these trends, and differences between the two samples, in more detail. We use errors derived from the posterior probability distribution where sample sizes are small.


## Dependence on the Presence of a Cooling Flow

The most prominent result from the NFPS clusters is that the presence of a cooling flow is highly correlated with the presence of emission lines in the BCG. Fig. 4 shows the bolometric X-ray luminosity against the cluster velocity dispersion (a proxy for dynamical mass). We can see that most of the cooling flow clusters have larger X-ray luminosities for their mass, and that it is these clusters that have a BCG with line emission. Therefore, in the rest of the NFPS analysis we separate our sample into CF and non-CF subsets. Notice that in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 (which we discuss below), none of the emitting BCGs are non-CFs. As mentioned in Section 2.1.1, we use a rather strict cut for our definition of a CF, requiring ROSAT basedṀ > 100M ⊙ yr −1 . However, changing our arbitrary definition of a CF cluster (e.g. to those withṀ > 10M ⊙ yr −1 ) does not significantly change our results. It would be useful to have a way to identify likely cooling-flow clusters without the need for high quality surface brightness and temperature maps. Recently, McCarthy et al. (2004) has shown that CF clusters show significantly higher total X-ray luminosities, relative to their total dynamical mass, consistent with predictions from steadystate cooling models. On the other hand, non-CF clusters can be well modelled with cosmological haloes in which the gas has been preheated to ∼ 300 − 500 keV cm 2 (Balogh et al. 2006, see also). This suggests that one could use the excess X-ray luminosity relative to these preheated models as an indicator of CF status. The solid line in Fig. 4 represents models for clusters with preheating from Babul et al. (2002). Indeed, using this method arrives at results for the emission fraction which are very similar to those obtained when we use the mass deposition rate to define CF clusters. The separation is not as striking as in McCarthy et al. (2004), probably because the measured velocity dispersion can be systematically affected by substructures.


## Magnitude Dependence

We show in Fig. 5 the line emission strength as a function of K absolute magnitude for the NFPS and SDSS BCGs and Table 1. Summary of Results. The first column presents the survey studied, NFPS or SDSS. SDSS (RED) includes only the red-selected SDSS galaxies, and SDSS (X-ray) only those with X-ray counterparts. Column 2 indicates if the results are for the BCGs or Controls. Column 3 shows the total number of galaxies for each sample. The number of these which are emitting is shown in column 4, and column 5 shows the fraction of emitting galaxies. Column 6 lists the number of strongly emitting (Wo(Hα)> 2Å) galaxies in each sample for which the emission line ratios are characteristic of AGN activity (usually LINER). We present the number of galaxies in our sample which are known to belong to a CF cluster in column 7. Column 8 shows the number of these galaxies in CF which are also emitting, and the final column shows the fraction of emitting galaxies in CF clusters.

control galaxies. The NFPS clusters are separated into CF and non-CF cases. In the non-CF clusters, there are no emitting BCGs, and the fraction of emission-line galaxies, shown in the bottom panels, is also very low for the control galaxies (∼ 5 %). On the other hand, in CF clusters ∼ 70 % of the BCGs show emission, as we noticed also in the previous section. Moreover, the BCGs with strong emission tend to be the brightest galaxies, MK < −25.5, where by definition, there are few control galaxies. Hence, this trend is quite different from what is seen in the control sample, where almost all of the emission line galaxies are fainter than MK = −25.

For magnitudes near MK ≈ −25, where there is substantial overlap between the two populations, the emission line fraction of both populations are similar for non-CF clusters. The results from the SDSS, which include all clusters regardless of X-ray luminosity or CF status, are consistent with the results for the total NFPS. There are somewhat fewer emission-line BCGs at a given magnitude than the for NFPS, presumably because CF clusters make up a smaller proportion of the sample in the SDSS. We will say more about this in Section 4. Also highlighted on Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are the BCGs with LINER-like emission. Most of the emitting BCGs are more characteristic of LINER emission; this is especially true of the less luminous BCGs.


## Dependence on Location in Cluster

In our samples, there are some BCGs that are found close to the X-ray centre, while others can be found several hundred kpc away. In this section we will investigate whether or not the presence of emission lines in the BCG depends on its distance to the X-ray centre. This is illustrated in Fig. 6 where we show the line emission as a function of cluster radius for the NFPS galaxies. All of the strongly emitting BCGs are within 50 kpc of the X-ray centre. As discussed in the previous section, these emitting galaxies are also usually found in a cooling flow cluster. In the rightmost panel we show the equivalent plot for the 34 BCGs in the SDSS sample for which we have X-ray centres. Although the sample is small, our results are consistent with those seen in the NFPS; only those BCGs that are close to the X-ray centre have significant line emission.

A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the Hβ distributions of the non-CF BCGs and the controls shows no evidence for a difference in the two populations. Therefore, to summarize, we conclude that an increased frequency of optical line emission in BCGs is observed only for those galaxies that lie within 50kpc of the X-ray centre of a CF cluster. For the remainder, the frequency of emission in BCGs is consistent with that observed in the control population.


## Dependence on Cluster Mass and Density

The SDSS provides us with an optically-selected sample, spanning a wide range in velocity dispersion, that should be representative of the cluster population independent of X-ray properties. In this section we use this full sample (including those galaxies with (u ′ − r ′ ) < 2.2 that were excluded when comparing directly with the NFPS) to explore the effect of environment on the presence of line emission in BCGs.

Since the cooling flow status of a cluster might be correlated with its total mass, or central mass density, we wish to explore whether the trends we have observed are merely reflecting a more fundamental correlation with either of these quantities. First, in Fig. 7, we plot the fraction of BCGs with Hα emission as a function of the cluster velocity dispersion. There is no strong trend. Rather, a fraction ∼ 10-15 % of BCGs in each bin showing Hα emission is observed (the Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.17). We note that the frequency of radio-loud AGN is also found to be independent of velocity dispersion . The control galaxy population in the SDSS sample also shows no strong correlation between emission line fraction and group velocity dispersion (the Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.38). For the control galaxies, the overall fraction of emitting galaxies is somewhat higher than for BCGs, closer to 15-20%.

Next, we examine in Fig. 7 the frequency of emission lines in BCGs as a function of the galaxy density, as measured by the distance to the fifth-nearest spectroscopic neighbour. Even in the densest regions this corresponds to a smoothing scale of ∼ 200 kpc, so the measurement here is of the total mass density on scales larger than the cooling radius. Generally, one would expect the central regions of CF clusters to be the densest environments, and if the pres- The equivalent width of the line emission as a function of K-band magnitude for the NFPS galaxies on the left, and for the SDSS galaxies on the right. The NFPS galaxies are in subsets: a) All galaxies, including those in clusters where the CF status is unknown, b) those which are in known CF clusters, and c) those which are in known non-CF clusters. Filled circles represent BCGs, Xs for control galaxies, and open circles indicate LINER emission (for the SDSS sample only). The dashed line represents the cut between emitting and non-emitting galaxies. The BCGs for Abell 780 and Abell 1795 have unreliable Hβ equivalent widths, but nonetheless strong emission, and are represented by lower limits at Wo > 3.3Å and > 3.7Å, respectively. Bottom Panel: Using the same subsamples as the top panel, we plot the fraction of line emitting galaxies as a function of K-band magnitude. The solid line represents the BCGs, and the dotted line the control galaxies. The fraction of Hα emitting galaxies in the SDSS as a function of group velocity dispersion. The solid line refers to BCGs and the dotted line are the control galaxies. This adaptive histogram contains 85 galaxies per bin for the BCGs and 100 galaxies per bin for the controls. Right Panel: The fraction of Hα emitting galaxies in the SDSS as a function of the galaxy density. This adaptive histogram contains 85 galaxies per bin for the BCGs and 95 galaxies per bin for the controls.

ence of a cooling-flow was correlated with the mass or galaxy density on larger scales our previous results would lead us to expect the most star formation occurring in the most dense regions. On the contrary, we observe a clear correlation with the emission line fraction decreasing with increasing number density, and so BCGs are less likely to show emission lines if they are found in the densest regions of clusters (in both cases of the BCG and the controls, the Spearman test yields a correlation coefficient of ∼ 0.9, and the correlation is significant at the ∼ 95% confidence level). At all densities, the fraction of emission-line galaxies is higher in the control population than the BCG population. The fact that we observe enhanced emission for those galaxies within the smaller 50 kpc scale of the X-ray centre of CF clusters (Section 3.3) is therefore very likely related directly to the presence of cooling, X-ray gas on small scales, rather than the overall gravitational potential.


# DISCUSSION

The overall fraction of BCGs with emission lines is ∼ 13 % in the SDSS, and ∼ 20 % in the NFPS. The latter is in good agreement with Crawford et al. (1999) who find a fraction of 27 % emission-line BCGs in their sample of X-ray selected clusters. We do not know what the CF fraction is in an optically-selected sample, or as a function of mass. Nonetheless, since the fraction of massive clusters that host a cooling flow is likely no more than about 50 % (Peres et al. 1998;McCarthy et al. 2004;Chen et al. 2007), and CF clusters are systematically overluminous, we attribute the factor of two difference in emission fraction between our two surveys to the fact that NFPS (and Crawford et al. 1999) is X-ray selected, and therefore biased toward CF clusters.

There is currently much observational and theoretical work exploring the possible feedback between a central galaxy's AGN, current star formation, and the cooling X-ray gas (Silk & Rees 1998;Best et al. 2006;Croton et al. 2006;Bower et al. 2006;Sijacki & Springel 2006;De Lucia & Blaizot 2006, e.g.). AGN in the BCGs are thought to play an important role in suppressing cooling, and lowering mass deposition rates (and hence star formation rates). Our main result is that the majority of line emitting BCGs are positioned close to the X-ray centre of clusters classified as hosting a cooling flow directly from the mass deposition rates (as defined in Section 2.1.1). Furthermore, this result holds when we classify cooling flow clusters instead by their excess X-ray luminosity relative to other clusters with similar dynamical mass (a definition we explored at the end of Section 3.1). Similar conclusions, based on smaller samples, have been reached by others (e.g. Johnstone et al. 1987;McNamara & O'Connell 1989;Crawford et al. 1999;Rafferty et al. 2006). Importantly, we have shown that, in the absence of a cooling flow, emission lines are rare in BCGs, regardless of the mass density or velocity dispersion of the cluster. Moreover, a control population of similarly bright, centrally located cluster galaxies does not exhibit an increased frequency of emission lines in CF clusters. We therefore conclude that the observed emission (arising from star formation and/or an AGN) is directly related to the presence of cooling gas.

For the most part, we have not concerned ourselves with the origin of the observed emission, since starburst galaxies and optically-selected AGNs are probably closely linked (Kauffmann et al. 2003). However, it is worth investigating this further here. Crawford et al. (1999) find that the very strongest Hα emitters have star formation-like emission line ratios, while von der Linden et al. (2006) find that most BCGs, which display weaker Hα emission, are more characteristic of LINER activity. The six NFPS BCGs that have [NII]/Hα line ratios available from Crawford et al. (1999) lie in the regime straddling LINERS and Seyferts. Of the six emitting BCGs in the SDSS-X-Ray sample, the three stronger Hα emitters are non-AGN, which means that they are likely composite, whereas the somewhat weaker emitters are classified as AGN. Thus the emission-line BCGS found near the X-ray centre of galaxy clusters appear to be a heterogeneous class of objects.

In the unrestricted SDSS sample, we find only ∼ 13 % of BCGs have line emission, compared to ∼ 18 % for controls. This exhibits the same trend as in the von der  study of SDSS C4 cluster galaxies, where detectable emission line luminosity measurements (with S/N >3) are found in 30 % of BCGs, as opposed to 40 % for the other massive, central, galaxies (ie. controls). Our numbers cannot be compared directly, as their cut includes more weakly emitting systems as emitters than does our more strict criterion of Wo > 2Å. If we relax our definition of an emitting galaxy being one with Wo > 0Å, we find the percentage of line emitters increases to 27 % for BCGs, and 38 % for controls.

Our Fig. 7 reiterates the above point, that in the SDSS sample, the BCGs have a lower fraction of line emitting galaxies than the controls. This is also consistent with what Best et al. (2006) find: that emission line AGN activity is suppressed in the galaxies near the centre of the cluster with respect to the other massive cluster galaxies. They point out that emission line AGN and radio-loud AGN are partly independent populations, but that BCGs with emission-line AGN are more likely to host radio-loud AGN than other galaxies. Best et al. also find that radio-loud AGN are preferentially found in BCGs within 0.2 r200 of the centre of the cluster and that there is a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass, with ∼ 40 % of the most massive galaxies showing radio loud AGN emission. Therefore it is plausible that our emission-line BCGs in the NFPS (which are found at the centre of CF clusters) and in the SDSS (many of which show LINER-like activity), host radio-loud AGN. We therefore matched our NFPS BCGs to radio sources from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters survey (White et al. 1997, hereafter FIRST) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (Condon et al. 1998, hereafter NVSS). We find that indeed, all 12 of our Hβ emitting BCGs are radio sources. Furthermore, for the 50 BCGs in the FOV of the surveys, 28 of our BCGs have radio counterparts (∼ 56±11 %). Thus ∼ 42±11 % of non-Hβ emitting BCGs have radio emission. Again, the cooling flow status of the cluster appears important: ∼ 71 + 9 −14 % of CF BCGs are radio sources, and ∼ 80 + 7 −16 % of central CF BCGs are radio sources. For non-CF BCGs only ∼ 32 +12 − 9 % have radio emission. For the controls, 36 of 144 galaxies in the FOV of the surveys are radio sources (∼ 25±4 %).

Recently, Lin & Mohr (2006) have studied the radioloud properties of a large X-ray selected cluster sample, and find the overall radio-loud fraction to be ∼ 35 % for Kband selected BCGs within r200 of the cluster center (compared with ∼ 20 % for bright cluster galaxies, excluding the BCGs). This is in reasonable agreement with our results, although the radio-loud BCG fraction we measure is somewhat higher. Lin & Mohr (2006) also find a strong trend with cluster mass (inferred from the X-ray luminosity), though the strength of the trend is sensitive to the radio power limit and K-band luminosity of the galaxy. Our NFPS sample is too small to robustly identify such trends, but we note that the fraction of BCGs with radio sources that are in clusters with a velocity dispersion < 600km/s is 54±15 %, quite similar to that for BCGs in clusters with a velocity dispersion > 600km/s, 58±15 %. In the optically-selected SDSS, we find no significant trend with velocity dispersion, but an overall fraction of ∼ 40 % of the BCGs with radio emission, and ∼ 25 % of the controls. Because of the difference in sample selection, and the cluster mass estimators, we do not consider this a serious discrepancy with the results of Lin & Mohr (2006).


# CONCLUSIONS

We have used two large, homogeneous galaxy cluster surveys to investigate the incidence of optical emission lines amongst BCGs. The NFPS consists of 60 BCGs in X-ray selected clusters, while the SDSS sample is a larger, optically-selected sample of 328 BCGs. From these data, we are able to draw the following conclusions:

• Of the 10 BCGs that lie within 50kpc of the peak of X-ray emission in a cluster with evidence for a significant cooling flow, all show optical emission lines. Moreover, of the 12 BCGs that show emission, all are located within 50kpc of the X-ray emission peak, all are radio sources, and none are in clusters of known non-CF status (10 are in CF clusters, and 2 are in clusters with unknown CF status).

• Excluding the special circumstances noted above, the fraction of BCGs that exhibit optical emission lines is ∼ 10-20 %, and is always comparable to or lower than the fraction for control galaxies with a similar luminosity and environment.

• For optically selected cluster samples, which are dominated by non-CF clusters, the fraction of BCGs with emission does not correlate strongly with cluster mass or galaxy density.

We have therefore demonstrated a direct connection between the presence of cooling gas, and enhanced optical emission in a centrally located galaxy. It would be very useful to obtain pointed X-ray observations of those SDSS clusters in which we have found a BCG with Hα emission, to determine if this correlation holds in optically-selected samples. These clusters would also be potentially interesting for observation with Chandra to observe the X-ray emission morphology, as other massive clusters with Hα emitting BCGs, such as Abell 426 and Abell 1795 show remarkable X-ray morphology, such as X-ray holes, and cooling tails.

2The absorption-corrected NFPS Hβ equivalent width versus the SDSS Hα equivalent width (uncorrected for absorption) for galaxies present in both surveys. The points with Wo(Hα) = 0 are non-detections (plotted with the average Hα error of 0.15Å), and those with Wo(Hα) < 0 are detected in absorption. We identify line-emitting NFPS galaxies as those with Wo (Hβ) ≥ 0.5Å. Correspondingly, we use a value of Wo (Hα) ≥ 2Å for the SDSS galaxies. The best fit lines are constrained to go through (0,0) and are only fit to galaxies with Wo (Hα) ≥ 2Å and ignore an outlier at Wo (Hα) ≈ 40. The two different lines are fitting for Wo (Hβ) as a function of Wo (Hα) or vice versa.
