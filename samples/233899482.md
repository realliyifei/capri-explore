## Introduction

originating in the oropharyngeal cavity. It may be complicated by disseminated infections with more distal emboli, most frequently to the lungs. Presenting symptoms include pharyngotonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess, followed by ipsilateral painful swelling of the neck, fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, trismus, and other systemic symptoms. Lemierre syndrome typically involves the IJV, but the involvement of the external jugular vein (EJV) has rarely been reported.

We present a unique case of LS involving the EJV following an episode of tonsillitis and review the literature regarding LS involving the EJV.


## Case Report

The ethics committee of our institution waived the need for ethics approval and the need to obtain consent for this report. We present a unique case of LS involving the EJV followed by a literature review (►Table 1).

We present the case of an otherwise healthy 17-year-old girl who arrived at the pediatric emergency department (PED) presenting with lymphadenitis, pleuritic chest pain, and fever. She was diagnosed with tonsillitis a week prior to admission and was started on oral antibiotics. Due to a negative throat culture, she received only 3 doses of oral antibiotics that were discontinued. Three days prior to her arrival, she began suffering from left submandibular lymphadenitis, tenderness, and trismus. On the morning of her arrival she complained of chest pain and dyspnea.

On arrival, she was alert and oriented and had a temperature of 38.3 Celsius, tachycardia of 116 beats/min, and a normal blood pressure. On physical examination, there was swelling with extreme tenderness on palpation over the left cheek and neck (►Fig. 1). Throat examination revealed a swollen left tonsil covered with exudates, and multiple left lymphadenopathies of the Jugulodigastric region were palpated. Laboratory analysis revealed an elevated white blood count of 14.2 Â 10 6 cells/L (norm 4.0-11.0), elevated C-reactive protein of 57 mg/L (norm 5), and all other laboratory examinations were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative.

A Doppler ultrasound study was performed revealing enlarged cervical lymph nodes with small areas of necrosis and thrombosis of the left EJV. Due to this finding, the patient was referred for a neck contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan that demonstrated signs of extensive deep neck infection with lymphadenopathy and EJV and facial vein thrombosis (►Fig. 2A&B). An anatomical variant was noted, with anomalous facial vein drainage into the EJV (►Fig. 3). The lung apices demonstrated 2 small nodular ground glass opacities that, in the context of the EJV infective thrombophlebitis, may be suggestive of a metastatic infection. The patient's respiratory symptoms improved, and her chest X-ray was normal, so we decided not to perform a lung CT scan.

The patient was hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and treated with broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), which was switched to ceftriaxone and metronidazole as well as 


## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria


## Inclusion Criteria

Studies detailing the findings of patients with LS and EJV thrombosis were included. We also included retrospective studies and case reports. Only studies in English language were included. Letters, commentaries, and abstracts were eligible for evaluation.


## Exclusion Criteria

Studies not specifying external jugular thrombosis in the patients. Papers without radiological evidence of thrombophlebitis were also excluded.  


## Data Extraction

The extracted data included anatomical considerations, age and incidence, sex, pathogens, presenting symptoms, imaging, management, and outcomes.


## Discussion

The classical description of LS was published in 1936 as thrombophlebitis of the tonsillar or peritonsillar veins that can spread to the internal jugular vein (IJV). 1 The variant of LS involving the EJV is rare. In the patient discussed in the present article, LS involved the EJV and not the IJV.


## Anatomical Considerations

The anatomy of tonsillar venous drainage is via the peritonsillar plexus, which drains into the lingual and pharyngeal veins, which, in turn, drain into the IJV. The EJV is formed by the connection of the posterior division of the retromandibular vein with the posterior auricular vein (►Fig. 3A). To explain the formation of a thrombus in the EJV, an anatomical variant should be considered. The facial vein, which is part of the tonsillar drainage, may have a variant. In our case, the facial vein drained directly into the EJV and not into the IJV (►Fig. 3B). This anatomical variant is not rare and is found in 9% of the population. 2 In 12 patients described in our review of the literature, the thrombosis involved the EJV and IJV. This could be explained by the inflammation ascending in a retrograde manner into the EJVor by the anatomical variation of the cervical venous drainage. 2 Another explanation for the involvement of the IJV is by septic emboli of this infection through the mucosa. This is followed by local invasion of the lateral pharyngeal space and IJV septic thrombophlebitis. A primary infection, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), may facilitate the penetration of the mucosa. 3 This local involvement may eventually progress to involve the EJV.


## Age and Incidence

Lemierre syndrome occurs mostly in the 2 nd and 3 rd decades of life. In our review, there were 16 patients (61%) in their 2 nd and 3 rd decades of life. 4-15 A review by Karkos et al. revealed 51% incidence rate in the 2 nd decade. 16 Although this is mainly a young age group disease, in our review, LS was also found to be present in the 5 th to 8 th decades of life. 6,[17][18][19][20][21] Males are more commonly affected, 4 although for EJV thrombosis, there is an equal gender distribution. The annual incidence of LS is reported to be 3.6 per million persons/year. In the young age group (14 À 24 years of age), in which LS has been found to occur more frequently, the annual incidence is 14.4 cases/million. 22 Due to the paucity of reports regarding LS involving the EJV, we estimate that the incidence is even lower.


## Pathogen

The pathogen most commonly isolated in LS is Fusobacterium necrophurium, which is an anaerobic, gram negative bacteria. In our case, the culture was negative, similar to 4 of the reviewed cases. 5,10,20,23 In 10 to 15% of the cases, no organism was identified. 24 Other bacteria that might cause LS include group C streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus species. An interesting finding is that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was found in 3 cases, 13,21,25 and polymicrobial infections were found in 10 to 30% of cases. 3


## Presenting Symptoms

Our patient was diagnosed with tonsillitis, which then progressed to left submandibular lymphadenitis, cheek and neck tenderness upon palpation, trismus, and dyspnea. It is notable that LS is diagnosed clinically, and should be taken into consideration, when respiratory symptoms or neck swelling occur a week following a throat infection. Righini et al. described LS as developing in 2 clinical phases; the primary phase, which corresponds to an oropharyngeal infection of the mucosa, with or without signs of peritonsillar abscess, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy and the secondary phase, with the spreading of infection to the parapharyngeal space with thrombophlebitis of the IJV and sepsis. During the 2 nd stage, clinical examination reveals painful skin induration and inflammation anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle ipsilateral to oropharyngeal infection. 26 In our case, as well as in the reviewed literature cases involving the EJV, the presenting symptoms were sore throat and fever. 3,4,7,8,12,14,18,21,27 These symptoms, usually indicate involvement of the peri(tonsillar) area. As for the side involving thrombophlebitis of the EJV, the left side was more often involved.


## Imaging

In our case, the diagnosis of LS was made by ultrasonography (US). This was followed by a contrast-enhanced CT scan to enable better assessment of the blood vessels, to evaluate the extent of the inflammatory process and to rule out potential complications.

There are 3 imaging modalities that can yield the diagnosis of LS. Doppler US is an available tool that can detect JV thrombosis; however, it is operator-dependent and may be less sensitive in the area deep to clavicle or below the mandible.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent modality to assess anatomic structures and to demonstrate venous thrombosis; however, it is expensive, not readily available, and requires either sedation or general anesthesia in younger patients.

Computed tomography with contrast material has been shown to be the modality of choice for the diagnosis of LS. 28,29 It is cheaper and is available in most hospital settings, though it involves radiation exposure. It can accurately demonstrate signs of infection and detect thrombosis of cervical veins. Furthermore, CT is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of regional or distant complications, such as abscesses, metastatic pulmonary or systemic infection.


## Treatment

There is no consensus regarding the treatment of LS. The treatment requires antibiotics, occasionally anticoagulation, and, infrequently, surgery. In our case, we decided to treat conservatively with antibiotics and anticoagulation. In a review performed by Rebelo et al. regarding pediatric patients with LS, 11 patients were started on anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) within a median of 2 days from diagnosis. Ten patients (90.9%) had thrombus improvement or resolution within a median of 3.4 months. There were no adverse effects from anticoagulation therapy. The review of the literature revealed the use of anticoagulation in 63.7% of pediatric LS cases. 5 Even though we have seen a high rate of anticoagulation therapy among LS patients, in our review the routine use of anticoagulation in LS cases cannot be recommended because of limited data. Furthermore, the use of anticoagulation may not affect thrombus resolution. 6 Other authors recommend using anticoagulation therapy in specific cases such as the potential for retrograde progression to the cavernous sinus or extensive thrombosis. 28 In our review, when there was EJV involvement, there was no consensus regarding the need for treatment with anticoagulation therapy.

Ligation or resection of the IJV was proposed in uncontrolled sepsis or ongoing emboli. 28 Although accessibility to the EJV is easier than the IJV, ligation or resection are rarely recommended today.


## Outcome

Following discharge, the patient's follow-up was uneventful. In the review of the literature performed, all 26 patients with involvement of the EJV had a favorable outcome, except for 3 subjects. The 1 st patient was a 17-year-old with a peritonsillar abscess, which deteriorated into LS with a residual VII nerve palsy. 5 The authors state that the patient was noncompliant with anticoagulation therapy. 5 The 2 nd patient, with partial response, which was defined as an improvement of the thrombi with a decrease in size or partial recanalization, was not given anticoagulation treatment. 6 The 3 rd patient developed trochlear nerve palsy and was treated with antibiotics and anticoagulation. 27


## Final Comments

Lemierre syndrome is a life-threatening complication of a common clinical condition seen by the general physician. Lemierre syndrome involving the EJV is extremely rare, which may be attributed to an anatomical variant in our patient. Diagnosing LS still requires thorough history taking and clinical examination as well as awareness of the connection between current acute medical illness and a recent pharyngeal infection. This case has a significant educational value, which teaches us not to underestimate even a "simple" tonsillitis.
