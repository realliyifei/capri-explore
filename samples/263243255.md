Introduction: Telehealth has been widely promoted and adopted at multiple levels in the U.S.healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic.However, this rapid expansion of telehealth services may have further exacerbated health inequities among marginalized groups.Methods: Using the 2020 National Health Interview Survey, this study compared patterns of telehealth use between people with functional disabilities and people without disabilities during the first year of the pandemic.Results:In the multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, respondents with moderate disabilities were significantly more likely to report telehealth use, not pandemic related (OR=1.25,95% CI=1.03, 1.52) and telehealth use, pandemic related (OR=1.43,95% CI=1.28, 1.60) than people without disabilities.Similarly, respondents with severe disabilities were significantly more likely to report telehealth use, not pandemic related (OR=1.46,95% CI=1.07, 2.00) and telehealth use, pandemic related (OR=2.06,95% CI=1.72, 2.46).In addition, telehealth use varied by the number of limitations and disability type.Conclusions: People with functional disabilities were more likely to report telehealth use than people without disabilities.Furthermore, these associations strengthened with increasing disability severity and number of limitations while varying by disability type.Additional studies are warranted to explore ways of providing patient-centered telehealth to responsively meet various healthcare needs of people with functional disabilities and improve their health outcomes.

## INTRODUCTION

Approximately 61 million U.S. adults are living with at least 1 functional disability. 1 Most of these are older adults aged ≥65 years living with other chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart diseases. 1wing to their complex healthcare needs and vulnerability to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), people with functional disabilities (PWDs) were disproportionally affected by disrupted access to care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (pandemic). 2 For example, a recent study showed that PWDs were at greater risk of COVID-19−related mortality owing to their underlying health conditions. 3They also faced more significant COVID-19−related delays in or forgone medical care in the first year of the pandemic. 4With the pandemic, telehealth has been widely promoted and adopted at multiple levels in the U.S. healthcare system as an alternative to limited in-person healthcare services, allowing healthcare to be delivered remotely without any COVID-19 safety concerns for both patients and providers. 5lthough telehealth services were becoming increasingly available in the past 2 decades and at least half of the participants in recent surveys indicated that they were willing to use telehealth, the telehealth use rate was still low among U.S. physicians and the general population before the pandemic. 5,6Suddenly, unprepared healthcare providers and individual patients were shoved into telehealth to respond to the pandemic.This rapid expansion of telehealth services may have further exacerbated health inequities among marginalized groups (e.g., digital divide). 7Because PWDs have lower awareness and utilization of certain health information technology devices, 8 research regarding how changes in the ubiquity of telehealth have impacted PWDs is warranted.To partially address this gap, this study compared patterns of telehealth use between PWDs and people without disabilities (PWoDs) during the first year of the pandemic.


## METHODS


## Study Sample

Nationally representative data were extracted from the 2020 National Health Interview Survey, which covered civilian non-institutionalized individuals in the U.S. National Health Interview Survey used a multistage sampling framework, and the data were mostly collected by telephone in 2020 owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 9The final response rate for the 2020 adult sample was 48.9%. 9Our final analytic sample only included respondents aged ≥18 years who had information on all measures of interest and were interviewed between July and December 2020.


## Measures

The following 2 questions were used to identify a multinomial outcome measure of telehealth use within the past year (no use; telehealth use, not pandemic related [TUNPR]; telehealth use, pandemic related [TUPR]): (1)  In the past 12 months, have you had an appointment with a doctor, nurse or other health professional by video or by phone?and (2) Were any of your appointments done by video or by phone because of reasons related to the coronavirus pandemic?Following previous studies, we created 3 disability-related independent variables (disability severity [none, moderate, severe], number of disabling limitations [0, 1, 2, ≥3], and disability type [none, hearing limitation only, vision limitation only, cognitive limitation only, mobility/complex activity limitation only, and ≥2 limitations]). 4,10o control for potential confounding factors, this analysis included sociodemographic characteristics (age [18−49, 50−64, ≥65 years], sex, race/ethnicity [non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, other], marital status, education, family income based on federal poverty line, census region, and urban/rural), healthrelated variables (smoking status, drinking status, general health status, number of chronic conditions [including hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and cancer]), usual source of care, and health insurance coverage status.


## Statistical Analysis

We first compared disability status by telehealth use using chi-square tests.We then constructed 6 separate series of multivariable multinominal logistic regression models controlling for the aforementioned sociodemographic and health-related characteristics to investigate the associations between disability status and telehealth use.To account for the complex survey design of the data, we performed all analyses with survey procedures and recommended sampling weights in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).Statistical significance testing was 2-sided with a=0.05.The data set is deidentified and publicly available.Thus, this study was deemed exempt from review by the IRB of the University of North Florida.This study followed the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies guidelines.


## RESULTS

Our sample included 17,533 respondents (representing 249,976,968 U.S. adults), comprising 32.0% with moderate and 8.8% with severe disabilities.Percentages of TUNPR and TUPR were significantly different (Table 1, all p<0.001) by disability severity (none versus moderate versus severe: 4.7% vs 6.1% vs 7.4% and 21.7% vs 32.1% vs 45.5%, respectively), number of limitations (1 vs 2 vs ≥3: 4.7% vs 6.0% vs 5.3% and 29.2% vs 35.3% vs 47.5%, respectively), and disability type (with the highest prevalence among people with multiple limitations: 6.7% and 41.0%, respectively).

In the multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models (Table 2), respondents with moderate disabilities were significantly more likely to report TUNPR (OR=1.25,95% CI=1.03, 1.52) and TUPR (OR=1.43,95% CI=1.28, 1.60) than PWoDs.Similarly, respondents with severe disabilities were significantly more likely to report TUNPR (OR=1.46,95% CI=1.07, 2.00) and TUPR (OR=2.06,95% CI=1.72, 2.46).Other significant predictors of telehealth use included age, sex, education attainment, residing in urban or rural areas, having a usual source of care and insurance coverage, selfreported health status, and the number of chronic conditions.

In addition, Table 3 shows that people with 1 limitation (TUNPR: OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.02, 1.57; TUPR: OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.17, 1.48) and ≥3 limitations (TUNPR: OR=1.81, 95% CI=1.34, 2.45; TUPR: OR=2.36, 95% CI=1.99, 2.79) were significantly more likely to report TUNPR and TUPR.Finally, respondents with mobility/complex activity limitations (OR=1.40,95% CI=1.00, 1.95) or ≥2 limitations (OR=1.34,95% CI=1.06, 1.71) were more likely to report TUNPR, whereas people with hearing limitation (OR=1.28,95% CI=1.02, 1.59), cognitive limitation (OR=1.55,95% CI=1.25, 1.93), mobility/complex activity limitation (OR=1.52,95% CI=1.26, 1.84), or ≥2 limitations (OR=1.87,95% CI=1.63, 2.14) had significantly higher odds of TUPR.


## DISCUSSION

We found that PWDs were more likely to report both TUNPR and TUPR than PWoDs.Furthermore, these associations were strengthened with increasing disability severity and number of limitations while varying by disability type.According to Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, need, predisposing, and enabling factors significantly determine an individual's healthcare utilization. 11,12The higher prevalence of poor health outcomes and elevated healthcare needs among PWDs may be the driving forces of telehealth use for this population during the pandemic. 13Furthermore, consistent with a previous study in other healthcare settings, 14 the highest telehealth use among the vulnerable group of PWDs for those who had more severe disability or  Note: All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC), adjusting for the complex survey design and sampling weights.NH, non-Hispanic.

multiple disabilities was likely related to their worse health status (i.e., more chronic conditions) and more healthcare needs.Nevertheless, literature has also shown that PWDs reported more unmet needs for care during the pandemic, 4,15 suggesting that more frequent telehealth utilization for PWDs has not reduced health disparities or improved health outcomes for this group.This also raises concerns regarding the use of telehealth for PWDs without appropriately considering and responding to their unique constellation of needs in its design, implementation, and policy context. 3ur study shows that people with mobility/complex activity only and ≥2 limitations were more likely to report both TUNPR and TUPR.The higher prevalence of telehealth use among PWDs during the COVID-19 pandemic may also be related to their telehealth use behaviors before the pandemic.Previous studies show that individuals with mobility/complex activity limitations were satisfied with telehealth before the pandemic primarily owing to its convenience and affordability while avoiding transportation barriers. 16,17Their positive experiences in telehealth use may have allowed them to adapt more quickly to a broader telehealth adoption environment during the pandemic than PWoDs.In addition, the relaxed telehealth regulations and broadened telehealth availability for Medicare beneficiaries and PWDs during the COVID-19 emergency, 5,18 the fear of contracting the virus due to the greater risk of COVID-19 infection and related mortality, and reduced transportation and in-person healthcare service availability secondary to pandemic restriction measures and other mitigation-related policies ultimately created another large driving force of telehealth use among some PWD subgroups.Nevertheless, policymakers and healthcare providers should carefully assess the impacts of this telehealth use spike (i.e., quality of care, service parity, and payment parity) that was passively shaped by the COVID-19 emergency on health outcomes for both PWDs and PWoDs.

In addition, we found that being younger, being female, having higher educational attainment, living in urban areas, having insurance coverage, and having a usual source of care were significantly associated with higher likelihoods of TUPR among PWDs regardless of disability severity level.Potential explanations include having better access to technology such as computers and high-speed internet, which are essential for receiving telehealth services (i.e., younger groups and urban residents), 19,20 having more health and/or telehealthrelated knowledge and being more willing to adopt new technology (i.e., women and people with higher education attainment), 21,22 and having more enabling factors for healthcare utilization in general (i.e., those with insurance coverage and having a usual source of care). 11,12This further suggests that the current one-sizefits-all approach to telehealth may exacerbate health disparities for certain subgroups of PWDs.Thus, additional studies are warranted to explore ways of providing patient-centered telehealth to responsively meet various healthcare needs of PWDs and improve their health outcomes.


## Limitations

Our study has several limitations.First, the development of the pandemic and its related restriction measures varied at the state and local levels.Our models only controlled for census regions in the analyses owing to data availability.Furthermore, the telehealth-related policies and eligibility also varied by insurance plans and geographic locations in the early stage of the pandemic.This may also affect telehealth use behaviors across different subpopulations.Second, self-reported telehealth use may be subject to recall bias.The self-reported disability status may also have resulted in the misclassification of PWDs and PWoDs.Third, the lack of information about the sources of the disability (i.e., whether patients require specialty services) and types of appointments (i.e., general or specialty medical care) may also affect telehealth use.Finally, our study could not account for respondent vaccination status, telemedicine modality (e.g., phone, videoconferencing), and provider factors, which may affect telehealth use behaviors.


## CONCLUSIONS

PWDs were more likely to report telehealth use than PWoDs.Furthermore, these associations strengthened with increasing disability severity and number of limitations while varying by disability type.Additional studies are warranted to examine the influences of the potential confounders on telehealth use behaviors and explore ways of providing patient-centered telehealth to responsively meet various healthcare needs of PWDs and improve their health outcomes.
