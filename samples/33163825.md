Eight new genera and 30 new species are described: Cirrosus gen. n. (type species Cirrosus atrocaudatus sp.

## Introduction

The Linyphiidae is the second most diverse spider family in the world (Platnick 2014). Merrett (1963) studied the detailed structure of male palps of 124 British linyphiids, and grouped them into linyphiines and erigonines; Millidge made a great effort to identify the major lineages of the Linyphiidae based on male palpal morphology (1977), epigynal and tracheal system morphology (1984) respectively, and acknowledged seven subfamilies or groups (1993); Hormiga (2000) integrated a numerical cladistic method in his analysis of erigonine phylogenetic relationships, and found support for the monophyly of the subfamily Erigoninae. As suggested by Tanasevitch (2014a), the Linyphiidae should now be divided into the seven subfamilies: Dubiaraneinae Millidge, 1993, Erigoninae Emerton, 1882, Ipainae Saaristo, 2007, Linyphiinae Blackwall, 1859, Micronetinae Hull, 1920, Mynogleninae Lehtinen, 1967and Stemonyphantinae Wunderlich, 1986 It is commonly acknowledged that the linyphiid spiders are the dominant spider group of the temperate and cold regions of the northern hemisphere (Marusik and Koponen 2002;Paquin and Dupérré 2003;Scharff et al. 2003;Scharff and Gudik-Sørensen 2006). Although the study of its diversity is still immature, the family seems to be much less diverse in the subtropical and tropical regions (Scharff 1990;Sørensen et al. 2002;Floren and Deeleman-Reinhold 2005). Only a few works have focused upon the Linyphiidae in Southeast Asia (Thorell 1898;Locket 1982;Millidge and Russellsmith 1992;Millidge 1995;Tanasevitch 2010;Tanasevitch 2014b). Thorell described eight Erigone species and two Linyphia species from Myanmar (Thorell 1895(Thorell , 1898 but the lack of illustrations in these two works made it difficult to use them for further identifications; Thorell's work was later revised by van Helsdingen (1969) and Tanasevitch (2010) respectively, and useful figures were added; Locket (1982) investigated linyphiid species from western Malaysia, from where fourteen species were reported and five new genera were established; eleven new genera of Linyphiidae from rain forests of Southeast Asia were described by Millidge and Russell-Smith (1992); Tanasevitch (2014b) established two new genera from Laos: Asiagone Tanasevitch, 2014, andLaogone Tanasevitch, 2014, and in addition, he reported 6 new species.

Xishuangbanna of southern Yunnan belongs to the transitional zone from tropical southern Asia to subtropical East Asia . Only a small number of linyphiid spiders have been reported from Xishuangbanna in the past studies, in contrast with the large number of spiders of less diverse groups found there (Tang and Li 2010;Gao and Li 2014). In 1995, one new genus Nasoonaria Wunderlich & Song, 1995 from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan was established and two new species were described: Nasoonaria sinensis Wunderlich & Song, 1995 and Batueta similis Wunderlich & Song, 1995, the latter is the first species of genus Batueta Locket, 1982 to be found outside of western Malaysia (Wunderlich and Song 1995), where this genus was originally described. In 2010, a new species Neriene poculiforma  was reported from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan , which is the twenty-ninth Neriene species found in China, making China the country harboring almost half of the total number of Neriene species.

Our research on the linyphiids in the tropical rain forest in Xishuangbanna of southern Yunnan has revealed 30 new species, together with 18 species already described, making a total of 48 from this tropical area.


## Material and methods

Specimens in this study were mainly collected by fogging, trapping, sieving and handcollecting from tree canopy, tree trunks, and leaf-litter in tropical rain forest in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan (the four main collection localities are shown in Fig. 120). Collections were made throughout the year by Qingyuan Zhao, Guo Zheng, Zhiyuan Yao, Zhigang Chen and Guo Tang. Unless otherwise indicated all type specimens are deposited in the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing (IZCAS).

Specimens were examined using a LEICA M205 C stereomicroscope. Further details were studied under a BX51 compound microscope. Most illustrations were made using a camera lucida attached to an Olympus BX51 compound microscope, and then inked on ink jet plotter paper, and the rest were made from photographs. Male and female genitalia were examined and illustrated after being dissected from the spiders.

Left male palps are illustrated, except as otherwise indicated; photos and illustrations of right palps are flipped in figures to allow easy comparison with other species. Epigynes were removed and cleared in lactic acid or warm 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution before illustration. All embolic divisions and vulvae were imaged after being embedded in Arabic gum. Photos were taken with an Olympus c7070 wide zoom digital camera (7.1 megapixels) mounted on an Olympus BX51 compound microscope. Images from multiple focal planes were combined using Helicon Focus (version 3.10) image stacking software. All measurements are given in millimeters. Eye diameters were measured at their widest extent. Leg measurements are shown as: total length (femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, tarsus). The terminology of Erigoninae genitalic structure follows Hormiga (2000) and Tanasevitch (2014b); the nomenclature of Micronetinae genitalic structure is given after Saaristo and Tanasevitch (1996); the names of Linyphiinae copulatory organs follow van Helsdingen (1969).

Metatarsal trichobothrium (Tm) is given as the ratio of the distance between the proximal margin of the metatarsus and the root of the trichobothrium divided by the total length of the metatarsus (Denis 1949;Locket and Millidge 1953) and Tm value for the first and the fourth leg is given as TmI, TmIV respectively. The tibial spine formula, which expresses the number of dorsal tibial spines on each of legs I to IV, is given for species in which it differs from the type species of the genus. The patellar spine formula is given only if it differs from the most common one (1-1-1-1).

For the known species only the references for their original description and the synonyms of their current valid names are given. All the other synonyms and references are listed in Platnick's world spider catalog (2014).

Several species collected from canopy possessed a similar habitus. To verify the accuracy of pairing, the canopy linyphiids specimens were sequenced for DNA barcodes with the primers: 5'-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3' and 5'-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3' (Folmer et al. 1994). This sequence data set, together with COI sequences of linyphiid spiders from BOLD (http://www. boldsystems.org) (see more information in Table 1), was analysed using MEGA 5 (Tamura et al. 2011) and a Neighbor-joining tree was constructed.

Abbreviations and conventions. Abbreviations used in the text are given in Table 2. References to figures in cited papers are listed in lowercase type ( fig.); figures of this paper are noted with an initial capital ( Fig.).

Agyneta nigra (Oi, 1960) Meioneta nigra : Oi 1960: 211, figs 318-321 (♂♀). Remarks. Lamella characteristica of our specimen matches those illustrated by Saito (Saito 1983: 52, fig. 7) and differ slightly from Tanasevitch's (Tanasevitch 2005: 170, figs 26-23).


## Genus Asiagone Tanasevitch, 2014

Asiagone: Tanasevitch 2014b: 69. Type species Asiagone signifera Tanasevitch, 2014 from Laos. Tanasevitch (Blackwall, 1841)).


## Asiagone perforata


## Bathyphantes paracymbialis Tanasevitch, 2014

Figs 5-8  (Tanasevitch 2014b: fig. 16;Fig. 5A, D), two finger-like extensions of distal suprategular apophysis (Fig. 5C-D), and the slimmer embolus forming two coils (Fig.  5C). It differs from B. floralis  by the shape of paracymbium: 'U'shaped, with a blunt distal end in B. floralis   fig. 1B), whereas 'J'shaped, with a small projection at the paracymbium in B. paracymbialis (Tanasevitch 2014b: fig. 17; Fig. 5B). The female is recognized by the short parmula and copulatory ducts (Tanasevitch 2014b Diagnosis. This new species is mostly related to B. voluta Locket, 1982 andB. similis Wunderlich &Song, 1995, and can be distinguished from them by the two basal outgrowths of cymbium: one is broad, the other is blunt (Fig. 10A), while B. similis has two slim and curved outgrowths. The convector in B. cuspidata is well-developed, anterior branch long and erect, slightly folded distally (Figs 9A, 10B), in contrast with the short and pointed ones in B. voluta (Locket 1982: fig. 58) and B. similis (Wunderlich and Song 1995: fig. 10). The female is diagnosed by its spiraling copulatory ducts in epigyne (Fig. 11C), which was not clearly noted in Locket's work, but its ventral plate resembles that in B. voluta (Locket 1982: figs 62-63).

Tianmushan, 30°2.400'N, 119°3.000'E, 3.04.1983. Etymology. This name is derived from the Latin word 'laciniosus', which means 'indented', referring to the jagged fringe of the anterior terminal apophysis; adjective.

Diagnosis. This species is similar to C. tianmushana (Chen & Song, 1987) greatly, but differs by the following aspects: the edge of anterior terminal apophysis in C. laciniosa sp. n. is dentate (Fig. 18C), but smooth in C. tianmushana; the apex of pseudolamella in C. tianmushana is broad and strongly papillate (Saaristo et al. 2006: figs 18, 19, 21), while narrower and slightly bifurcate in C. laciniosa sp. n. (Fig. 17A-C); the thumb of embolus in C. laciniosa sp. n. is wider, but less pointed (Fig. 17C).

Male. Unknown. Distribution. Only known from its type locality.

Genus Curtimeticus gen. n. http://zoobank.org/3222D6B9-5916-4908-9E9C-5D4C2FEBCD40

Type species. Curtimeticus nebulosus sp. n. Etymology. The generic name is an arbitrary combination of letters. Gender is masculine.

Diagnosis. This new genus is diagnosed by its prominent anterior radical process and the stout, short embolus. Its embolic division is similar to those in members of genus Tmeticus Menge, 1868, Donacochara Simon, 1884. All of them have a simple, straight embolic division with an embolus proper (Millidge 1977: fig. 41), but it differs from the other two by having a bifurcate anterior radical process (Figs 26A, 29A), each branch with a blunt tip ( Fig. 26C-D) and an inconspicuous tailpiece. It is also clearly distinguished by the short palpal tibia with broad distal end and the short palpal patella without ventral teeth ( Fig. 27C-E). The epigyne in female resembles that in Oedothorax Bertkau, 1883 (Roberts 1987: figs 59b-o), but has longer copulatory ducts; The epigyne of female paratype is also quite similar to those in Paratmeticus bipunctis (Bösenberg & Strand, 1906) and Tmeticus nigriceps (Kulczyński, 1916) in ventral view (Marusik and Koponen 2010: figs 14, 18), but differs by the route of copulatory ducts (Figs 28C, 29D).

Description. Small sized Erigoninae. Carapace unmodified, reddish brown, with dark radial stripes in both sexes. Chelicerae with 5 promarginal teeth, and 4 retromarginal teeth in both sexes. Chaetotaxy: tibial spine formula: 2-2-1-1. TmI ca 0.50 in male, ca 0.60 in female, TmIV ca 0.70 in male, ca 0.50 in female. Abdomen greenish grey with a pale central patch.

Male palp: tibia with two retrolateral trichobothria and several ventral long setae; tibia with two apophyses, the retrolateral one petal-like ( Fig. 26A-B), the inner surface of which covered with inconspicuous papillae (Fig. 27A); protegular process prominent, with pointed tip (Fig. 26B). Radix small slender, with two anterior branches ( Fig. 26A, C-D); embolus stout, situated between radical process and protegulum (Fig. 26B); in ventral view the tegular sac partially covering the ventral tip of anterior radical process (Fig. 27B).

Epigyne: ventral plate wide, with copulatory openings at the junction of dorsal plate and ventral plate (Fig. 28C); copulatory ducts straight and long, in the shape of cylinder (Fig. 28C Eye sizes and interdistances: AME 0.06, ALE 0.06, PME 0.06, PLE 0.05, AME-AME/AME 0.33, PME-PME/PME 0.66, AME-ALE/ALE 0.50, PME-PLE/PLE 1.00, coxae IV separated by 0.75 time their width. Length of legs: I 2. 73 (0.76,0.20,0.75,0.63,0.39),II 2.51 (0.72,0.20,0.65,0.57,0.37),III 2.07 (0.56,0.20,0.48,0.48,0.35),IV 2.69 (0.74,0.20,0.70,0.69,0.36). Leg formula: I-IV-II-III. Abdomen greenish grey. Palp: see description of the genus.

Female (one of paratypes). Total length: 1.69. Carapace 0.73 long, 0.55 wide, dark red. Sternum 0.70 long, 0.55 wide. Clypeus 0.09 high. Eyes sizes and interdistances: AME 0.07, ALE 0.05, PME 0.05, PLE 0.06, AME-AME/AME 0.29, PME-PME/PME 1.00, AME-ALE/ALE 0.20, PME-PLE/PLE 0.50, coxae IV separated by 0.93 time their width. Length of legs: I 2. 65 (0.76, 0.20, 0.70, 0.60, 0.39 Diagnosis. This species is similar to D. locketi (Tanasevitch, 1983) in the general shape of epigyne (Tanasevitch 1989: fig. 127), but different in the detailed structure: the spermathecae in D. separatus sp. n. are more separated than those in D. locketi (Fig.  30B), and situated closer to the posterior rim of the epigyne; the two pieces of separated ventral plate are narrower and more pointed (Fig. 30A).

Description. Female (holotype). Total length: 1.60. Carapace 0.69 long, 0.55 wide, yellow, with dark margin. Sternum 0.36 long, 0.41 wide. Clypeus 0.14 high. Chelicerae promargin with 4 teeth, retromargin with 3 teeth. Eye sizes and interdistances: AME 0.05, ALE 0.06, PME 0.06, PLE 0.06, AME-AME/AME 0.20, PME-PME/PME 0.67, AME-ALE/ALE 0.13, PME-PLE/PLE 0.17, coxae IV separated by 1.92 times their width. Length of legs: Male. Unknown.

Remarks. The diagnosis of this species is solely based on the female specimens and the genera within or related to the Savignia group share very similar epigynal structure, which makes it rather difficult to place species in correct genus by comparing epigynes only. The value of TmI of this species and the pattern on its abdomen's dorsum seem to be different from other existing congeners in Dactylopisthes, but it could be tentatively placed in this genus because of its resemblance to D. locketi. A more reasonable diagnosis will be made when the male specimens are collected and studied.

## Erigone grandidens Tu & Li, 2004

Erigone grandidens: Tu and Li 2004: 420, fig Genus Gladiata gen. n. http://zoobank.org/3C41D5A8-393F-4417-BB08-2A4E13D6B7D2

Type species. Gladiata fengli sp. n. Etymology. The generic name is an arbitrary combination of letters. Gender is feminine.

Diagnosis. The number of spines on tibia IV and the conformation of male palp implies that this genus should belong to subfamily Erigoninae, and the conspicuously large proximal cymbial projection resembles that in erigonine genera Minicia Thorell, 1875, Eskovia Marusik & Saaristo, 1999, Sintula Simon, 1884. The embolus in this new genus takes an anti-clockwise route to form a loop, in contrast with the distal suprategular apophysis turning clockwise (Fig. 33B), which is rare in other erigonines. The atrium in female's epigyne resembles that in the genus Ketambea Millidge & Russell-Smith, 1992, Tapinocyba Simon, 1884, but the copulatory ducts follow a different route.

Description. Median sized Erigoninae. Male with post-ocular area slightly elevated, with a row of setae along the axis from clypeus to the fovea (  Etymology. This specific name is derived from the Chinese Pinyin 'fēng lì', meaning 'pointed, sharp', in reference to the pointed proximal cymbial outgrowth of the male palp; term in apposition.

Diagnosis. See diagnosis of the genus. Description. Male (holotype). Total length: 2.78. Carapace 1.16 long, 0.78 wide, post-ocular area slightly elevated, with a row of setae growing along the axis from clypeus to the fovea. Sternum 0.63 long, 0.58 wide. Clypeus 0.19 high.

## Genus Nasoona Locket, 1982

Nasoona: Etymology. This specific name originates from the Latin word 'circinatus, meaning 'coiled', for the long embolus exhibiting coil-like loops; adjective.

Diagnosis. Male of N. circinata sp. n. can be distinguished from the type species by the modified carapace (Fig. 59E), prominent distal suprategular apophysis and the long, coiled embolus in palp (Fig. 58B). The female is distinguished from N. sinensis Wunderlich & Song, 1995 by the different pathway taken by the copulatory ducts and by the position of spermathecae (Fig. 60C).

Description. Male (holotype). Total length: 2.35. Carapace 0.95 long, 0.75 wide, reddish brown, raised into a hump in the middle of the thoracic part, with a row of long setae growing along the axis from the ocular area to the hump.

Leg formula: I-II-IV-III. TmI 0.60. Spination of patella like in male. Epigyne: atrium broad (Fig. 64A), scape of dorsal plate with a slightly pointed end (Fig. 64C). Spiral grooves with about three coils (Fig. 64B-C). Spermathecae situated mesally (Fig. 64C).

Distribution. Known only from type localities. Remarks. We have closely examined and taken photos of the holotype of Ambengana complexipalpis Millidge & Russell-Smith, 1992 (Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Dr Peter J. Schwendinger), both the left palp and the habitus (Fig. 66). By comparing it with the pictures from Xu's paper (Xu et al. 2010: figs 1-7), a few differences were found in the detailed structure of palp between two species. Whether or not the new synonymy proposed by Xu et al. (2010) is valid is uncertain, and a further study is required.

Oilinyphia: Ono and Saito 1989: 232 Etymology. The name comes from the Chinese Pinyin 'héng jĭ', which means 'ridge', referring to the transversal ridges on the dorsum of its abdomen; noun in apposition.

Diagnosis. This species is similar to O. jadbounorum Ponksee & Tanikawa, 2010 from Thailand by the body shape, conformation of palp and epigyne, but differs from sibling species by wide tip of the embolus (Fig. 69A) (pointed in O. jadbounorum (Ponksee and Tanikawa 2010: fig. 3)). Females of two species differ by the shape of the median extension of the ventral plate tapering in O. jadbounorum (Ponksee and Tanikawa 2010: fig. 2) and almost rectangular in the new species (Fig. 71A). The new species clearly differs from the generotype by having TmIV, 2 cheliceral teeth instead of 3, small papillae on the abdomen and by the shape of the copulatory organs.

Prosoponoides: Russell-Smith 1992: 1369. Type species Prosoponoides hamatus Millidge & Russell-Smith, 1992 from Sumatra.


## Prosoponoides hamatus Millidge & Russell-Smith, 1992

Prosoponoides hamatus: Millidge and Russell-Smith 1992:  Genus Smerasia gen. n. http://zoobank.org/B33D870C-7F08-4BB0-9D71-93AA7366729D

Type species. Smerasia obscurus sp. n. Etymology. The generic name is a combination of 'smer' and 'Asia', 'smer' is the first a few letters of the genus name Smermisia, which is similar to this new genus by the conformation of the male palp. Gender is masculine.

Diagnosis. This genus resembles Neotropical genera Smermisia Simon, 1894 andMyrmecomelix Millidge, 1993 in the general appearence of the male palp and the conformation of embolic division (Miller 2007). They all have a plate-like radix, and an erect anterior radical process. Smerasia gen. n. differs from similar genera by having short and weakly sclerotized, less pointed, membranous embolus ( Fig. 89C-D) (Miller 2007: figs 63-64, 104), and the paracymbium in Smerasia gen. n. is attenuated at apex and much more curved in general (Fig. 89B). The epigyne in Smerasia gen. n. is wide and with a convex dorsal plate (Fig. 91A), which is quite different from that in Smermisia and Myrmecomelix.

Description. Small sized Erigoninae. Carapace uniformly yellow. Male with modified carapace: PME area elevated with sulci behind PME and pit in them. Carapace unmodified in female. Abdomen pale with dark spinnerets area. Chelicerae in male with 5 promarginal and 5 retromarginal teeth, while female with 4 promarginal and 4 retromarginal teeth. Tibial spine formula: 2-2-1-1. TmI ca 0.80, TmIV ca 0.70.

Male palp: tibia with one short and straight dorsal apophysis; paracymbium with black, attenuated apex (Fig. 89B); protegulum small (Figs 89B, 92B); radix simple, plate-like, with short, broad tailpiece (Figs 89A, 92A); anterior radical process straight, curved, with a pointed tip (Figs 89A, 92A); distal suprategular apophysis with a broad tip ( Fig. 89C-D); embolus short, inconspicuous (Fig. 89A).

Epigyne: ventral plate wide, with rounded posterior margin (Figs 91A); dorsal plate mesally concave; copulatory ducts straight (Figs 91C); spermathecae with multi-chambers, the bigger one elliptical (Fig. 91C); fertilization ducts rather short (Fig. 91B) Etymology. This name is derived from the Latin word 'obscurus', which means 'obscure', referring to the ambiguous shape of the embolus; adjective.

Diagnosis. See diagnosis of the genus. Description. Male (holotype). Total length: 1.76. Carapace 0.70 long, 0.64 wide, PME area mildly elevated, post-ocular sulci with pits stretching along the base of lobe laterally, light yellow. Sternum 0.41 long, 0.50 wide. Clypeus 0.23 high.

Length of legs: Distribution. Known only from type localities.

Genus Tapinopa  Etymology. This name is derived from the Latin word 'undatus', which means 'wavy', referring to the shape of the proximal edge of the paracymbium; adjective.

Diagnosis. This species is related to T. vara Locket, 1982 (from Malaysia), but differs in the shape and size of terminal apophysis (Locket 1982: figs 100-102); the pit hook in T. undata sp. n. is longer and has a more pointed tip compared to the related species (Fig. 93C).

Female. Unknown. Distribution. Known only from type localities.


## Tapinopa vara Locket, 1982

Tapinopa vara: Etymology. This name is combined by 'bi', and 'dentatus', meaning 'with two teeth', which refers to the two projections on the lateral margin of the prolateral cymbial outgrowth; adjective.

Diagnosis. This species is distinguished as a member of Theoa by the extension at the dorso-mesal side of cymbium, and the sickle-shaped embolus with Fickert's gland about half way along (Locket 1982 : fig. 87). The large spermathecae on each side of the epigyne also resembles those in T. tricaudata (Locket 1982: fig. 89). It differs from the type species in the following aspects: the apex of cymbial outgrowth in T. bidentata sp. n. is bifid (Fig. 96A), not trifid as in T. tricaudata (Locket 1982: fig. 86); the pit hook in T. bidentata is not a discrete structure and is pointed, which differs from the bifid one in T. tricaudata; the terminal apophyses in the two species are of different shapes (Locket 1982: fig. 84; Fig. 96B); the spermathecae are more distantly spaced in T. bidentata (Fig. 98A). The two species also differ in spination: 1-0-0-0 or 1-1-1-0 in the generotype and 2-2-2-2 in the new taxon.

## Discussion

The process of matching the sexes of the Xishuangbanna linyphiids collected from the forest canopy is arduous, especially with the occurrence of similar habitus and conformation of epigynes (Figs 46,62,99). In order to solve this problem, we conducted molecular work to obtain DNA sequence barcodes of COI from freshly collected linyphiid spiders (mostly from canopies), and constructed a Neighbor-joining tree. The pairing results are shown in Figure 121.

We have described some new species based on only one sex, which is an unconventional act. However, we feel reasonably certain that our conclusions are generally valid and taxonomically informative. While there may be errors in the identification of some species, finding the other sex of monotypic species will take much time and effort, and we believe it is best to share our information as soon as possible. Further investigations should be conducted in Xishuangbanna and neighboring places. More new discoveries will definitely benefit our understanding of the systematics of the linyphiids from Southeast Asia.
