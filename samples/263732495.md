In multilevel logistic analyses of risk factors of hypertension, older age and comorbidities (central obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hyperuricemia) were associated with an increased risk of hypertension in both ethnic groups. In the Bouyei, non/ex-drinkers or light drinkers experienced significantly reduced risk than the harmful drinkers (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.72 for non/ex-drinkers; and OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.77 for light drinkers). In the Han, better education and having no family history of hypertension were observed to be associated with a decreased risk of hypertension(Table 3).

The authors wish to add the following amendments and corrections to their paper published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health [1].

### Associated Factors of Hypertension

In multilevel logistic analyses of risk factors of hypertension, older age and comorbidities (central obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hyperuricemia) were associated with an increased risk of hypertension in both ethnic groups. In the Bouyei, non/ex-drinkers or light drinkers experienced significantly reduced risk than the harmful drinkers (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.72 for non/ex-drinkers; and OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.77 for light drinkers). In the Han, better education and having no family history of hypertension were observed to be associated with a decreased risk of hypertension (Table 3). Ref indicates reference. All the variables were included as fixed effects in multilevel models; a Diabetes was defined as fasting glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or reported diagnosis; b Dyslipidemia was defined as TC ≥ 6.22 mmol/L, LDL ≥ 4.14 mmol/L, TG ≥ 2.26 mmol/L, or HDL < 1.04 mmol/L.

The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused to the readers by these changes.
