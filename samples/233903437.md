Organizations sustainability largely depends on employees performance. Organizations usually implement the more intense work system to gain their appropriate growth. But employees performance needs to sustain for the long term growth. This review study intending to identify how the individual component of Transformational leadership able to sustain employees performance. This is a review paper in nature, so this paper reviewed previous studies and identified the relationship of Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individual Consideration with Sustainable Employees Performance. Based on the discussion this study has future direction for researchers to study further.

Transformational leadership style has four components; Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individual Consideration. These four components develop the impact of transformational leadership (Buil et.al.,2019). This study will survey the previous literature to identify the relationships between Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individual Consideration with sustainable employees performance.


## II. LITERATURE REVIEW


## Idealized Influence (II)

TFL was forwarded by Burns (1978) after that Bass (1985) develop this concept into a more wide range of leadership theories where leaders develop employee's performance through motivates and encouragement. After that Bass & Avolio (1995), develop four components of TFL. These four components act as a whole to develop the TFL style. At first Idealized influence, can develop employee performance by communicating collective purposes and values, demonstrating confidence and determination, and acting as charismatic role models (Yue et.al.,2019). Another study reveals that II develop managers as a role model for employees. Where managers set a standard for employees to follow and develop their performance according to that standard. Managers create a clear vision for the employees to make them give full effort to achieve a goal. II works as a tool for managers to develop employee's standardized performance (Boamah et.al.,2018). Sheehan et.al.,(2020), develop a study based on TFL considering Idealized Influence and Inspirational Motivation. In that article, it was identified that II can develop collaboration among employees to perform tasks and share knowledge. Employee's collaboration is a good technique to develop an employee's performance by sharing between employees. This process includes the exchange of knowledge, expertise, experiences, and skills, where each employee will teach each other about performing a task. Transformational Leaders emphasize the employee's through II for their personal development to perform better at the workplace. TF leaders take care of the needs of employee's, thus employees feel important at the workplace and increase their engagement at work. II comes out better work to develop employees willing to perform itself at the workplace (Afsar et.al.,2019).

In II, the leader's concerns are more on charismatic actions. These actions impact the employee's behaviour. Employee's behaviour towards "I can do" feelings on any task. Leaders can develop beliefs on employee's ability to do more in their work. Leaders influence employee's by adding values and purpose in their work. Inspiring employee's in a way that employees have become concerned about their work itself (Jackson, 2020). According to Chen et.al., Idealized influencing has more strength than other components of TFL. Findings reveal a strong Cronbach's alpha score which entails that II's charismatic's actions can develop strong employee's performance at the workplace.

Mi et.al., (2019) explains idealized influence as the charisma of TFL that can make follower's to trust their leaders. Idealized influence develops respect towards their leader's decisions and makes the followers follow the leaders. According to this literature idealize influence enhances employee's identifications with their leaders.


## Inspirational Motivation (IM)

Another important component of TFL is inspirational motivation. Inspirational motivation is largely used by leaders to develop a collective vision of the organization among employees. by doing so, leaders create collective goals to achieve for employees. Through frequent interaction between employee's helps a lot to achieve the target. Transformational leaders inspire employees by giving them the meaning of work. This causes develop employee's achieving willingness. Leaders inspire employee's to work as a team and achieve the set goal by performing well (Afsar et.al.,2019). According to Chen et.al.,(2020), inspirational motivation is used to define organizational motives and vision to the employees. Through inspirational motivation, employee's performance is driven towards achieving the organization's vision by inspires and appeal the employees. Leaders inspire employees' motivational speech, words, by individually talk to them. Leaders also use symbolize and imagery processes to motivate employees for the development of their performance. According to findings where it clears that inspirational motivation has a very strong relation to employee performance development (Boamah et.al.,2018).

Jackson,(2020), said that inspirational motivation concerns the way to motivate employees. Inspirational motivation spread positivity towards employee's to develop their performance at work. Clear vision and goal setting are another way to inspire employee's performance. Communication develops a barrier-less environment for employees to get inspiration to do more. For employees, it is very important to know what they have to do. Employees need instruction or help to do their job appropriately. 


## Intellectual Stimulation (IS)

Intellectual stimulation 3 rd the components of transformational leadership style, where leaders intellectually stimulate employees to perform at the workplace. Intellectual stimulation used by leaders to develop employee capabilities of exploring and capture opportunities to develop performance. IS develop employee's new perspective to think and make the decision on any problems, whether it is new or old (Afsar et.al.,2019). Employees get the opportunity to think from the new perspective of an old problem, where they can consider a wide variety of opinions to make decisions. IS solicits employee's perspective on problems in this way to develop more opportunities. Transformational leaders encourage employee's performance by developing critical thinking skills. The development of these skills and knowledge help employees take a challenging task at the workplace. IS develop empowering conditions among individuals. where the employees can get quality support to develop performance, information to create opportunities and resources to sustain their performance at the workplace (Boomah et.al.,2018). Jack(2020), studied leadership and describe IS as the way of developing a challenging environment for performing tasks at the workplace. The challenging situation helps employee's to raise new ideas. This process stimulates the employee's performance to be sustained in the workplace. Various perceptions open up by employees to complete a challenging task. Intellectual stimulation develops employee's assumptions and encourages them to perform better at work (Chen et.al.,2020).

According to Carreiro et.al.,(2019), IS has employee behaviour which entails interest in solving problems with their ability in new ways. IS develops employee's conceptual, understanding, and analyzing abilities to improve the quality of performance. Employees become more focused internally and achieve explanatory power regarding the adaptation of new ways of thinking to solve a problem. So, intellectual stimulation helps employee's performance.


## Individual Consideration (IC)

The fourth component of transformational leadership is individualized consideration. Where individual employees are treated differently based on their needs to develop their performance at work. Every employee is different than another one, so employees needed to mentor or coach differently to make full potential of employee's performance (Boomah et.al.,2018). According to Chen et.al.,(2020), in terms of individual consideration, leaders treat individual employees based on their inter-cultural differences. Because of diverse workplaces, leader's approaches are also diverse. Employee's needs play a vital role in their performance. IC is all about how to understand and develop the employee's performance. The study reveals positive results about Individual Consideration and employee's performance. It is tough to maintain but for sustainable employee's performance it one of the important element (Afsar et.al.,2019). According to Jack,(2020), individual consideration is the leader's personalized support for employee's. where leaders give attention to follower's needs to perform tasks at the workplace. Based on the needs, advice provided on how to complete a specific task given.

Mi et.al.,(2019) studied on TFL and describe individual consideration as an employee cultivation process. Employee's personal needs will be in consideration. Even employee's private life including their family members is treated as a whole. According to the author, this process of IC will make employees feel an indebtedness and feeling of appropriateness. This will develop a strong sense of emotional bond with the organization, hence employee's remain loyal, and performance can be sustained. Previously individual consideration's focus was on employee career development, enhance potentials of employees, developing abilities, development of individuals based on the culture and personal needs (Monje Amor et.al.,2020, Afsar et.al.,2019, Chen et.al.,2020.


## III. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION

Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individual Consideration are the components of Transformational Leadership (Carreiro et.al.,2019). As per the researchers, these components can develop sustainability on employee's performance. Through this review process, it has been clear that Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individual Consideration has a direct and significant impact on sustainable employee's performance (Afsar et.al.,2019).

Intensive work system force employees to perform in their full ability. But in the long run, employees become less loyal and organizations face low outcome from employees. The transformational leadership style works for employees to enhance their performance and help employees to cope with the needed changes in the organization (Chen et.al.,2020). Based on the discussion from the literature, it can be said that Idealized Influence component help employees to get influence from the leaders to work with their full potential. Leaders influence employees to perform the task which might very difficult but employees can perform (Boamah et.al.,2018).

Employees get inspiration and motivation from leaders, as leaders stimulate every employee's internal perception towards organizations objective. Thus employees are able to perform beyond their self-interest (Bass,1985). TFL style considered as one of the best because it deals with individual employees. Which help employees to express their issues, and leaders can take action based on the different employees perspective (Min et.al.,2020). These four components are effective to sustain employees performance (Buil et.al.,2019). As it is a review of previous research, so the result might be different at present due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. A more in-depth analysis will be recommended to measure the impact of Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individual Consideration on SEP in the period of COVID-19 Pandemic.
