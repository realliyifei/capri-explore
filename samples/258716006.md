Bladder cancer (BCa) and prostate cancer (PCa) are genitourinary cancers which constitute significant health problems in men and in which environmental factors play an important role. Understanding the genetic susceptibility to BCa or PCa and occupational exposure is paramount to improving cancer prevention and early detection. The aim of this review article was to address the scientific evidence on the genetic risk factors and occupational exposure associated with the occurrence of BCa and PCa. The authors identified relevant original articles that have been published between 1994 and 2023. Variations of the following search terms: "gene" and "occupational" combined with one of the following terms: "bladder cancer" or "prostate cancer" were applied for the search purpose. The authors found 342 publications of which 50 population studies met their requirements for gene-occupation interactions. In total, 34 full-text manuscripts were about BCa and 16 about PCa. These research examines the genes involved in detoxification processes of xenobiotics (glutathione S-transferase, N-acetyltransferase, cytochrome P450, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase), oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase 1, manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase), altering DNA repair capacity (X-ray repair cross-complementing 1, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair), tumour suppression (TP53 gene), and vitamin D pathway (vitamin D receptor gene). The role of genetic factors in the occupational exposure has not been conclusively established, but it appears the possibility of genetic involvement. Determination of environmentally responsive genes provides important mechanistic implications for the etiology of occupational cancers, and valuable input in occupational exposure limits set by taking genetic susceptibility into account. More genetic research is needed to corroborate these findings and assess their significance in the workplace. Med Pr. 2023;74(2)

## INTRODUCTION

Bladder cancer (BCa) and prostate cancer (PCa) are genitourinary cancers, which are among the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men. The BCa was the ninth most common cancer in 2020 in the world and the one with the highest recurrence rates among all cancers. The authors observed male predominance all over the world (Figure 1). The BCa is the fourth in Europe and fifth in the world most common cancer in men. The highest worldwide incidence rates are observed in 2 common types of BCa. The first, which is called nonmuscle-invasive BCa occurs in approx. 75% of patients. It is characterized by non-aggressive natural history, has good prognosis, and can be treated locally. The second one, called muscle-invasive BCa, occurs in approx. 25% of patients and is often treated with cystectomy. The PCa has symptoms ranging from small indolent low-grade tumours, to large aggressive life-threatening tumours [3]. To estimate the prognosis and decide on the treatment of PCa, clinical factors such as tumour stage, diagnostic prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and biopsy Gleason score [4] are used.

The primary risk factors for BCa include male gender, advanced age, tobacco smoking and chemical carcinogens from occupational exposure and general environment [5]. For BCa the attributable risk for occupational carcinogen exposure history alone is 5-8% [6,7]. In the case of PCa, the major known risk factors include advanced age, ethnicity, family history and lifestyle (diet, physical activity, cigarette smoking) [8]. For many years researchers have been investigating the association between occupational exposure and the risk of developing cancers. Multiple studies show evidence of an association between the development of BCa and PCa and occupational exposure to carcinogens classified as Group 1 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) such as trichloroethylene and benzidine. A potential association has also been described for exposure to carcinogenic agents classified as Group 2A -perchloroethylene, and other industrial chemicals such as aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, arylamines, aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, diesel exhaust, chlorinated hydrocarbons and toluene [9,10]. Due to the differences between the incidence of the disease in individual employees with the same exposure, other factors, including their genetic background, might also influence the risk of developing BCa or PCa. Therefore, genetic testing of the workers constituted the next step of the evaluation of the risk of BCa and PCa among exposed workers. There is evidence that the kind and rate of enzyme metabolism participating in the detoxification processes of xenobiotics are determined by genetic polymorphisms. Genetic susceptibility to occupational exposure may be one of the potential mechanisms of BCa and PCa risks among exposed workers. Despite the described associations between the genotype, exposure and the occurrence of the disease, the results are considered controversial and require further investigation. This review summarizes the current evidence of a genetic role in the BCa or PCa incidence among exposed workers.    applied in the review. Finally, the reference lists of the included manuscripts were also searched. The search process has been outlined on Figure 3.


## METHODS


## RESULTS

The literature search resulted in the identification of 342 articles, of which 34 full-text manuscripts about BCa and 16 about PCa were included in the review. The collected publications include research conducted using biological material, i.e., genomic DNA isolated from blood (N = 37), buccal cells (N = 7) or tissue samples (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors, N = 6) in which genetic polymorphism, copy number variation (CNV), mutations, DNA methylation (DNAm), DNA adducts and telomere length (TL) were examined, determined by the use of methods such as the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analyses. The DNA was extracted from buccal cells only in the case of PCa studies and from tissue samples only in the BCa studies.

The first paper on gene-occupational interaction and BCa was published in 1994. The study was conducted among workers from metal and electronic industries and painters exposed to industrial chemicals [11]. Whereas the first PCa case-only study was published in 2001. It was conducted among outdoor workers exposed to ultraviolet (UV) [12]. Publications on BCa were published more often and over a longer period of time (from 1994-2022) than those on PCa. The final number of manuscripts and their publication dates for BCa and PCa, which were selected for this literature review are presented in Figure 4.

The main types of studies were case-control studies, where the study group consisted of employees who were occupationally exposed to toxic or carcinogenic substances. In turn, the control group consisted of healthy people who were not exposed, who could work in similar conditions as the study group, or of people with other occupations. There were also studies in which the control groups were partially exposed to xenobiotics. Among the studies, there was also a case-only study, where all the employees who had been surveyed developed cancer. The group was divided into people who were exposed or the relationship between genetic tests and the type of cancer was examined. The cancer free study concerned healthy employees, where the group of employees was divided into exposed and unexposed employees, in whom genetic polymorphism of genes that could predispose to a selected type of cancer was tested [13][14][15]. Due to the significant differences in the occurrence of individual genotypes in populations, all the studies took into account differences in population, race or ethnicity so that the study group was homogeneous. Table 1 summarizes the studies on the gene-occupation interactions and the BCa incidence. In the publications where the BCa incidence was studied, the surveyed  employee groups were occupationally exposed to aromatic amines (AAs), azo dyes (AD), asbestos, arylamines including, benzidine and β-naphthylamine, benzidine, combustion fumes, metalworking fluids, organic solvents, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chemical carcinogens and hazardous compounds. The group of workers who were exposed mainly to these industrial chemicals included metal/plasticprocessing machine operators, fabricators, assemblers, painter, hairdressers, textile workers, leather workers and others working in dyestuff industry, paint industry, printing ink industry, rubber and cable manufacture, vehicle maintenance, repair, plumbing and road transportation. Among these employees the genetic research mainly involved genes important in tumour suppression, xenobiotics metabolism altered DNA repair capacity and BCa-related genes. Gender was considered as one of the risk factors for the incidence of BCa. As many as 7 of 28 publications concerned groups of male employees [16][17][18][19][20][21][22] and only 1 study concerned women [13]. The remaining studies were conducted taking into account both genders. Exposure to pesticides, PAHs, Pb, Cd, UV, asbestos and hazardous chemicals predominated in the PCa studies. The main role in the research was played by the nested case-control and Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohorts of farmers and agricultural workers, which were used for the research several times over the years by various groups of researchers. The cohorts consisted entirely of Caucasian race (Table 1). Multiple carcinogenic agents with sufficient evidence or limited evidence in human cancers have been described by IARC. These agents also appeared as occupational carcinogens in the production of aluminium, auramine, magenta, firefighting, painting, rubber manufacturing, and sufficient evidence for association with BCa could be shown. The agents with limited evidence of BCa in humans included: 4-chloro-ortho-toluidine, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, pioglitazone, tetrachloroethylene. In the case of PCa, limited evidence for arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds, cadmium and cadmium compounds, thorium-232 and its decay products, X-and γ-radiation was indicated.

Occupational exposure in dry cleaning, exposure to engine exhaust, diesel, in the professions of hairdresser or barber, in printing processes, occupational exposure of chimney sweepers to soot and the textile manufacturing industry showed limited evidence of BCa, whereas working as a firefighter, working in a rubber manufacturing industry of PCa [23].

Farming entails a way of life with occupational exposure to various agents which it is difficult to separate into individual components. Different observations between excess risks among American farmers may reflect lifestyle or farming practices. There is some evidence that fat consumption and chemical contaminants in fat, especially organochlorines from pesticides and herbicides, may modulate the androgenic hormones action [24]. Nested case-control and AHS cohorts exposed to various pesticides have been particularly well studied in terms of genetic susceptibility to PCa [13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. The most diverse number of types of pesticides was included in the analyses by Koutros et al. [25]. They collected data on up to 49 pesticides such as organophosphate insecticides (coumaphos, terbufos, fonofos and phorate), and pyrethroid insecticide (permethrin).

Schroeder et al. [26], in the group of occupations carrying a risk of cancer included a gasoline station attendant, automobile mechanic, gasoline station attendant, farmer, truck, bus, and taxi drivers. These occupational groups are exposed to, among others, cutting or lubricating oils, paint thinner or stripper, organic solvents, welding or soldering materials, soot, pesticides or insecticides. In another study, Nasr et al. [27], as risk occupations included frame works such as hairdressers, truck or bus drivers, roofers, chimney sweepers, truck drivers, tar and asphalt workers, brickyard workers, blacksmiths as well as work in various types of industry: paint, printing ink industries, rubber and cable manufacture, textile and leather works, aluminum industry, gas industry [27]. Ben Fradj et al. [28] took into account the effect of working in construction, painting, vehicles maintenance, repair, plumbing, road transportation as well as air-conditioning, farming or gardening and mining on occupational disease risk.

Some works used general terms related to the type of hazard that existed in the working environment, i.e., carcinogenic substances, chemical carcinogens or hazardous compounds. Therefore, it can be suspected that some of the study groups included workers with a wide range of exposure.

Depending on the research hypothesis, the importance of different genes was assessed. The studies were linked in particular to genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in 1) detoxification processes of xenobiotics, 2) oxidative stress, 3) altering DNA repair capacity, 4) tumour suppression, and 5) vitamin D pathway genes. 


## Genes responsible for detoxification processes of xenobiotics

Both in the BCa and PCa studies, genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics were most often examined. Table 1 shows 18 studies which focused on genes related to xenobiotics metabolism in BCa, while 5 such studies in PCa. Occupational exposure in these studies was related to workers" exposure to various industrial chemicals or chemical carcinogens such as AAs, hair dye, benzidine, combustion fumes, hazardous compounds, organic solvents, PAHs and pesticides.

Glutathione S-transferase Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is one of the major xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes and one of the most frequently studied genes. The GST genes are divided according to similarities between enzymes of amino acid sequences into 7 different families. The GST mu (GST M), pi (GST P), theta (GST T), and alpha (GST A) are particularly important. Homozygous deletion in GSTM1 or GSTT1 genes (null genotype) is related to the loss of enzymatic activity. The presence of at least one gene copy of GSTM1 or GSTT1 leads to enzymatic activity. The GSTT1 and GSTM1 deletion polymorphisms have been associated with numerous diseases including cancers. The GSTM1 genotype is well documented to be associated with the risk of BCa. Some studies did not show the relationship between occupational exposure to AAs, PAHs or benzidine and the GSTM1 genotype and the incidence of cancer in different populations [11,26,[29][30][31][32]. However, the relationship between an increased BCa risk, GSTM1 genotype and occupational exposure to hazardous compounds [33] or metalworking fluids [34] in Caucasian population, or occupational exposure and exposure to solvents in Serbia men [21] was shown. Four studies examined the genotypes GSTP1 such as -A1578G, -C2293T in different populations [13,21,29,31]. Only 1 of them indicated a significant interaction with the GSTP1 genotype and occupational exposure [21]. The GSTT1 studies were conducted in employees such as workers of dye stuff industry and other risk occupations where AAs, PAHs, benzidine, organic solvents, pesticides, hazardous compounds and other chemical carcinogens are used. Regardless of the tested population or occupational exposure of workers, no direct relationship with the BCa risk, genes and exposurewas shown [29][30][31][32][33] AAs In bladder cancer studies both sexes if not indicated, b All group exposed, c Number of exposed/unexposed.  [21]. Only 1 study reported results related to GSTA1 genotype. The result showed an association between this gene, the BCa risk and occupational exposure [21]. Among the cases of PCa, an association with genetic polymorphism in genes GSTM1, GSTP1 and occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals or PAHs was observed [35,36]. The DNA methylation (DNAm) in gene GSTP1 was examined in cancer-free studies. The DNAm in GSTP1 gene was not related to PAHs exposure among firefighters [14] but it was related to the pesticides exposure [15].


## N-acetyltransferase

The coding gene N-acetyltransferase (NAT) was the second most frequently studied gene. The NAT enzymes detoxify a large group of industrial chemicals. Its role is known in the metabolism of numerous aromatic amines [37]. Its enzymes can catalyse both N-acetylation and O-acetylation reactions and are implicated in the activation and detoxification of wellknown carcinogens [38]. The NAT2 is a carcinogen detoxification gene and several different allelic variants exist that determine the acetylator phenotype. Links with NAT2 acetylation status was well documented to be associated with the risk of BCa. The 2 expressed genes encoding NAT activity, NAT1 and NAT2 were screened for genotype in 10 studies. The authors reported that genetic polymorphism in NAT1 enzyme involved in biotransformation of benzidine and its metabolite, did not show a direct relationship with the BCa risk, genotypes in NAT1 T1088A, C1095A, G560A and exposure to benzidine in Chinese population [39]. Other studies conducted on Chinese population showed that NAT2 G191A, C282T, T341C, C481T, G590A, A803G, G857A genotypes have no impact on genetic susceptibility to occupational benzidine exposure and the BCa risk [40]. Also in Lebanese population, studies showed the lack of a direct relationship with gene encoding enzyme involved in carcinogens and their metabolites inactivation. The researcher showed that NAT2 genotypes C282T, G191A, A434C, C481T, T111C, G590A, C759T, G857A, T341C, A803G were not associated with BCa and exposure to AAs [27]. The studies conducted among Caucasian population [29,34], Japanese population [41], White race [26] also did not indicate genetic susceptibility to occupational exposure and the BCa risk. They included groups of workers exposed to AAs, PAHs, metalworking fluids or industrial chemicals, respectively.

Three studies suggested a significant relationship with an increased BCa risk, occupational exposure to combustion fumes and NAT1 in Lebanese population [20] or NAT2 in Caucasian population [33], and a significant relationship with a decreased BCa risk, occupational exposure to hazardous compounds, NAT1 and NAT2 in Caucasian population [42].


## Cytochrome P450

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a key enzyme for activation of bladder carcinogens, i.e., AAs and PAHs, which require formation of reactive metabolites with damaging effects. Three studies investigated the relationship between CYP genetic polymorphisms, occupational exposure and the BCa risk [11,18,29]. The researchers focused on the following genotypes: CYP1A2(-2467T/delT rs35694136, -163C/Ars762551), CYP1A1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1. In these studies no significant relationship between the gene, exposure to AAs, PAHs or hazardous compounds and the BCa risk was observed. In the PCa risk study, genotypes of the gene such as CYP24A1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1 were also not related to pesticides exposure [43]. Even though in the last several years, studies showed that CYPs activity may be a modulating factor along the continuum from the occupational exposure and certain cancers, no molecular epidemiology study has shown the role of genetic polymorphisms of CYPs in the interaction between occupational exposure and the risk of BCa or PCa.


## UDP-glucuronosyltransferase

Metabolism and clearance of endogenous and exogenous carcinogenic compounds is primarily catalyzed by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A and UGT2B enzymes. They conjugate and detoxify aromatic amines, and play a role in benzidine metabolism. Studies show that UGT gene promoter activity or enzymatic activity is modulated by genetic polymorphisms at the UGT1A and UGT2B. On the basis of these data, it was hypothesized that UGT gene polymorphisms reduce the capacity to glucuronidate carcinogens and other types of cancer-promoting factors (e.g., sex hormones), and may be associated with cancer risk. Studies by Selinski et al. [44] and Figueroa et al. [34] showed an association between the BCa risk, UGT1A rs11892031 genotype and AAs, PAHs or metalworking fluids exposure. Moreover, Lin et al. [45] reported a relationship between an increased BCa risk, dye exposure and genotype in UGT2B7 C802T [45]. Genes responsible for altering DNA repair capacity X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) acts as an indispensable factor in base excision repair (BER). Genetic polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XRCC3 Thr241Met, XPD Lys751Gln were studied by Shen et al. [17]. The molecular epidemiology study showed a relationship with a reduced BCa risk and genotype at the XRCC3 codon 241. Despite this, no direct relationship with the BCa risk and genes and exposure to AAs, PAHs was found. The xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) is essential for repair of bulky adducts from carcinogens. Sak et al. [49] showed the lack of an association between the BCa risk, genotypes in XPC-PAT, Lys939Gln, IVS11-6 and exposure to chemical carcinogens in rubber and plastics industry, laboratories, printing, paints, dyes or diesel fumes. Two other studies by Sak et al. [50,51] 


## Genes responsible for oxidative stress


## Genes responsible for tumour suppression

Human tumour suppressor gene TP53 The human tumour suppressor gene TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer. Mutations in this gene are found in over half of human cancers. The human TP53 locus, encodes a tumour suppressor protein whose functions initiate transcription of genes involved in the processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, metabolism, DNA repair, autophagy, and cellular senescence in response to stressors. The wild type TP53 gene was classified as tumour suppressor [55]. Kannio et al. [56] in their case-control study and Taylor et al. [19] in their case-only study presented no direct relationship with TP53 mutation and exposure to asbestos or arylamines, respectively. In the case-only study by Kelsey et al. [57] a relationship with occupations (metal/plastic-processing machine operators, fabricators, assemblers) and TP53 mutation in men was shown. Koutros et al. [58] in the results of their caseonly study documented a relationship between highrisk occupations (workers occupationally exposed to cutting or lubricating oils, paint thinner, organic solvents, pesticides) and mutations in TP53 and cell-cycle pathway genes.


## Genes responsible for vitamin D pathway

One of hypotheses advanced that vitamin D as antitumour agent might be responsible for the occurrence of PCa. Researchers observed an association between the PCa risk and 2 factors affecting decreased synthesis of vitamin D -the first increasing age and the second increasing rates in African-American population. Epidemiologic studies suggest that PCa development is influenced by environmental factors, including UV radiation from the sun exposure [59]. Ultraviolet B-rich sunlight stimulates synthesis of vitamin D in the skin and has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of PCa. Vitamin D is involved in a wide range of pharmacological and physiological functions. It modulates numerous genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Therefore, it is now established that vitamin D also influences the processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and apoptosis potentially leading to cancer [60]. Moreover, several studies investigated if vitamin D supplementation reduced circulating androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone), reduced PSA secretion and inhibited cell growth of the hormone-sensitive PCa cell line [61]. The action of vitamin D is mediated by the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR). Hence, genetic variations in the VDR as a PCarelated gene, may be important in determining disease susceptibility. However, the findings from analytic studies have been inconsistent on the role of vitamin D in the PCa development. Two studies of the relationships between gene polymorphisms and PCa in outdoor workers analysed steroid hormone receptor gene polymorphisms such as VDR. One of the studies was a case-only study and showed a significant relationship between an increased PCa risk of metastases and VDR ff andmelanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) Val92/Val92 [12]. The case-control study investigating 4 SNPs in VDR regulatory regions such as Cdx-2, FokI, TaqI, BglI showed a significant relationship with a reduced PCa risk, sun exposure and the following genotypes: FokI rs10735810 FF or Ff, TaqI rs731236 tt, BglI BB [62].


## CONCLUSIONS

Many studies indicate that the genotypes presented in this review exhibit a significant association with the risk of developing cancer. Therefore, gene polymorphisms represent a potential biomarker also for BCa and PCa. The genetic basis of BCa and PCa is gaining increased attention and more and more evidence especially in gene-environment interaction studies. The attention paid to the role of genetic polymorphisms in increasing BCa and PCa susceptibility in workers exposed to industrial chemicals and chemical carcinogens constitutes the scope of this review. The objectives of this literature review were to investigate the state of genetic diversity as additional risk factors and enhancers for the main occupational exposure attributable factors. So far, research has mainly been conducted among employees on low-penetrance genes involved in xenobiotics metabolism that contribute to the BCa and PCa risks by augmenting the effects of chemicals and carcinogen exposures.

The role of genetic factors in the occupational exposure has not been conclusively established, but it appears the possibility of genetic involvement. Determination of environmentally responsive genes provides important mechanistic implications for the etiology of occupational cancers, and valuable input in occupational exposure limit setting by taking genetic susceptibility into account. On the other hand, even if polymorphisms for genetic susceptibility have a clear role in identifying cancer risk, the value of wide scale genetic screening in occupational settings remains limited due to primarily ethical and social concerns. Thus, the large scale genetic screening in the workplace is not currently recommended. However, the possibility of using genetic polymorphisms as an important factor for limitation dose and cancer prevention should not be forgotten in future interpretations. More genetic research is needed to corroborate these findings and assess their significance in the workplace.

In conclusion, there is a considerable number of studies that indicate a significant association between the increased BCa and PCa risks and susceptibility genes in the general population [63][64][65][66].

Moreover, examples of various occupational carcinogens exposure that have an association with the risk of BCa or PCa have been shown [67,68]. However, when considering genetic susceptibility in exposure to chemicals as cancer risk factors, statistically insignificant results have been often obtained. This confirms that the development of cancers presented here is influenced by several risk factors present in the general population, which probably vary significantly between individual employees. The importance of chemical exposure at work as a risk factor for the BCa and PCa incidence is directly related to tobacco smoke, gender differences, age, schistosomiasis and other lifestyle and nutritional modifiable factors. The importance of exposure to cancer risk factors is not limited to the workplace. Therefore, the inseparable non-occupational risk factors should not be overlooked.

related to the association between 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the XPC gene, and 14 SNPs in the XRCC1, industrial chemicals exposure and the BCa risk showed only a relationship with an increased cancer risk and Ala499Val, Ex15-184, Ex15-177 genotypes. No significant association between the genes and exposure was found. excision repair and nucleotide excision repair The BER and nucleotide excision repair (NER) are highly versatile and sophisticated single-strand DNA damage removal pathways. The BER and NER counteract the deleterious effects of a multitude of DNA lesions, including damage induced by environmental sources[52]. Association molecular epidemiology studies by Barry et al. investigated 394 tag SNPs at the 31 BER and 324 tag SNPs at the 27 NER, genes responsible for repair of a broad range of DNA damage. The results showed a relationship between an increased PCa risk and fonofos use and NEIL3 rs1983132 CT/TT[53]; fonofos use and ERCC1 rs2298881 A; carbofuran use and CDK7 rs11744596 TT, rs2932778 TT genotypes[54].Base
