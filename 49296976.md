Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is a rare benign panniculitis found in term and post-term neonates. Diagnosis is based on clinical characteristics and specific alterations in the adipocytes, detected by anatomical pathology. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn can occur in uncomplicated pregnancy and childbirth. However, perinatal complications such as asphyxia, hypothermia, seizures, preeclampsia, meconium aspiration, and even whole-body cooling used in newborns with perinatal hypoxia/anoxia may be associated with this entity.

s We report a 10-day-old patient born at term by c-sectiondue to fetal bradycardia resulting from severe perinatal asphyxia (one and five-minute Apgar score 2 and 6, respectively), and who underwent whole-body cooling. After discharge from the neonatal ICU, at 9 days of age, the infant began to present multiple soft and non-adherent purple-erythematous nodules on the dorsum, in addition to a single similar lesion located on the left shoulder ( Figure 1).


## Laboratory findings revealed thrombocytopenia and hypoglycemia.

Ultrasound of the skin and soft tissues was initially perfor-  The etiology of SFNN is unknown, but maternal factors (Rh incompatibility, preeclampsia, cocaine use, and calcium channel blockers) and fetal factors (whole-body cooling, perinatal asphyxia, and sepsis) appear to be involved. 2 It is postulated that neonatal asphyxia leads to shunting of blood from the skin and fat tissue to nobler structures like the heart and brain, leading in turn to fat necrosis. 3  discharge of sterile pus from the biopsy site. 6,7 The most important differential diagnosis is sclerema neonatorum, a disorder in which there is thickening of the skin secondary to fibrosis of the trabecular septa of the adipocytes' involvement of the muscle and bone tissue, associated with congenital malformations, cyanosis, respiratory disorders, and sepsis. 8 Another differential diagnosis is scleredema, which presents progressive edema of the extremities and stiffening of the affected limbs, usually preceded by gastrointestinal or respiratory infections; anatomical pathology reveals intense interstitial edema associated with lobular panniculitis without vasculitis. 9

Subsequent workup included a biopsy of the left subscapular nodule, which showed preservation of the epidermis and dermis and lobular panniculitis. The adipose lobules of the hypodermis showed histiocytic reaction and extensive necrosis, characterized by intracytoplasmic deposits in the adipocytes that formed radial, needle-shaped crystals, representing the triglyceride crystals dissolved during the histological processing of the sample(Figures 2 and 3).Clinical-histopathological correlation confirmed the diagnosis of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (SFNN).

Although it can be self-limited, it may evolve with relevant systemic alterations, especially acute renal injury secondary to hypercalcemia. It usually affects term newborns that have undergone birth trauma, or complicated by dystocia, asphyxia, or meconium aspiration.1

Management of patients with SFNN involves constant cli-nical follow-up for at least six months and laboratory surveillance of potential complicationslike hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and thrombocytopenia.9It is thus important to orient parents on the signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia in order to initiate prompt treatment. In the current case the patient remained in regular follow-up and evolved without complications(Figure 4). In general, since SFNN is a benign, self-limited condition, complete resolution of the lesions can be expected, without scarring . q
