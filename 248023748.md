Supplementary Material no. 2 Bat selfies: Photographic surveys of flying bats

Highlights:• We show how photographic methods can be used to survey flying bats to determine their distribution, habitat use, and roosting sites.• We describe the types of camera systems that are required, using highspeed flashes and automated infrared trip beam systems, to get sharp, well-focussed photographs that enable species identification.

• Camera traps can be set in areas where bats concentrate in flight, such as exiting roosts in caves, buildings or hollow trees, or drinking over ponds.

• Photographic surveys can complement echolocation call surveys as a non-invasive study method to reduce risks of disturbance or disease transmission in situations where capturing bats is not desirable or necessary.
