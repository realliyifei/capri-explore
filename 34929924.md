Background/Aims: There are no established guidelines for bowel preparation formulation for bowel cleansing, nor is there an optimal method of dealing with inadequate bowel cleansing.This study investigated bowel preparation formulation preferences and responses to bowel preparation situations using surveys.Methods: The study surveyed 221 Korean lower gastrointestinal endoscopists from January to March 2015 and assessed their responses.Results: The analysis indicated that 2-L polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus ascorbic acid (Asc) was the preferred method (76.5%) and most responders expressed satisfaction with the formulation in both potency and safety.To address poor bowel preparation on the day of colonoscopy, the majority of physicians chose to order ingestion of additional preparations and proceed with the colonoscopy as scheduled (56.6%).In addition, concerns about renal safety and electrolyte stability were raised regarding oral sodium phosphate.Conclusions: This study found that 2-L PEG+Asc was preferred for potency and safety, and that Korean endoscopists preferred to proceed with colonoscopy in poor bowel preparation situations rather than choose an alternate diagnostic modality.(Korean

## INTRODUCTION

Colonoscopy is the most effective screening method for identifying and preventing colorectal cancer, and polypectomy performed with colonoscopy effectively resects precancerous adenomas. 1,2Adequate bowel cleansing is essential for accurate colonoscopy and requires an optimal balance of diet control and bowel preparation formulation.An ideal bowel preparation formulation should provide an excellent bowel cleansing effect while preventing electrolyte imbalance, and should also be affordable and well-tolerated by patients. 3However, no bowel preparation formulation currently available meets all of these criteria, and the choice of bowel preparation formulation largely depends on the patient's condition and the physician's preference and experience with the agents.A 4-L polyethylene glycol (PEG) preparation has minimal influence on serum volume or electrolyte balance, allowing it to be used safely in patients with other comorbidities, such as renal, cardiac, and liver diseases.

not completely finish because of the large volume formulation required (up to 4 L), the bad taste, and the odor, leading to inadequate cleansing. 3,5Improving the flavor or fragrance of the formulation has been attempted to address the limitations of PEG and to increase patient compliance.
6
The 2-L PEG plus ascorbic acid (Asc) has a lower required ingestion volume (2 L) and the flavor is more tolerable, increasing compliance and satisfaction while retaining the effectiveness of 4-L PEG.
7
Oral sodium phosphate (OSP) is advantageous because of the small ingestion amount required and overall convenience; some reports have concluded that it is as effective as 2-L PEG＋Asc in bowel cleansing. 8However, OSP may cause temporary shifts in electrolyte balance, which may lead to complications in patients with a history of fluid-electrolyte balance, heart failure, unstable angina, renal disease, or liver disease with ascites.


## SUBJECTS AND METHODS


## Subjects

This study was based on questionnaires that included 12


## Survey items

The physicians received questionnaires that included 12 questions, for which multiple responses were allowed (Table 1): the most important factor in choosing bowel preparation formulation and the most preferred formulation of choice, addition of bisacodyl (and if yes, the condition for bisacodyl addition), approach for patients with severe constipation, response to inadequate bowel cleansing on the day of colonoscopy, the most probable cause of inadequate bowel preparation, incidence of electrolyte imbalance due to use of bowel preparation formulations, bowel preparation formulation that most frequently resulted in complications, the most concerning issues regarding prescription of bowel preparation formulas, and the characteristics of various bowel preparation formulations (2-L PEG＋Asc, OSP, and magnesium citrate combined with sodium picosulfate).


## Statistics

The subjects were categorized according to their employment institution (tertiary university hospitals vs. private clinics and secondary hospitals) and according to their location lected the safety of the formulation (13.8% vs. 25.0%,p=0.0349) and compliance as the most influential factor.

The analysis indicated that 76.5% of the responders preferred 2-L PEG＋Asc (69.7% vs. 83.0%,p=0.0197), followed by 4-L PEG, selected by 24.0% of the responders (32.1% vs.16.1%, p=0.0052).There was a significant difference in formulation preference between the responder groups.We found that 52.9% of the physicians responded that they did not prescribe bisacodyl in conjunction with bowel prepara-tion formulation (51.4% vs. 54.5%,p=0.6456).When bisacodyl was prescribed, it was selectively given to patient groups in which the degree of bowel preparation was expected to be poorer (i.e., severe constipation, elderly patients).

For patients with severe constipation, 48.9% of the responders preferred to add laxatives such bisacodyl (55.0% vs.

42.9%, p=0.0699) while another 49.3% chose to prolong the duration of diet control prior to colonoscopy (56.9% vs.

The Korean Journal of Gastroenterology 42.0%, p=0.0266).Other responses included, in the order of frequency, increasing the dose of formulation, dividing the formulation dose, and no additional preparation.

When met with inadequate bowel preparation on the day of colonoscopy, 56.6% of the physicians decided to order additional ingestion of the same formulation on the examination day and perform the colonoscopy as scheduled (55.0% vs. 58.0%,p=0.6539), followed by 28.5% of physicians that opted to reschedule the colonoscopy and prescribe the same formulation, in addition to laxatives and diet control (33.9% vs. 23.2%,p=0.0773).The following options were selected at similar rates: add another type of formulation and perform the colonoscopy as scheduled, reschedule the colonoscopy and prescribe another type of formulation, perform an additional enema and perform the colonoscopy as scheduled, and add a bowel preparation formulation through an endoscopic approach.None of the physicians selected an alternative method of colonic evaluation (such as double-contrast barium series or computed tomography scan of the abdomen).

The In regards to the magnesium citrate combined with sodium picosulfate, 39.4% of the physicians did not have any experience with the formulation (39.4% vs. 39.3%, p=0.9801).

Among the physicians that had experience with the formulation, 38.9% described it as having an inferior bowel cleansing effect compared to 4-L PEG (37.6% vs. 40.2%,p= 0.6959) and 28.1% indicated that it could cause electrolyte imbalance (34.9% vs. 21.4%,p=0.0263).Response rates were compared between tertiary university hospitals and private clinic/secondary hospitals, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in the majority of the items.A significant difference in the order of frequency was found in only one question: bowel preparation in patients with severe constipation.

The responses from Seoul (and the neighboring area) and other areas were compared, and significant differences were found in the response rates of several items, but there was no difference in the overall trend, and the order of frequency mirrored the other responses.


## DISCUSSION

Most physicians chose bowel cleansing potency, rather than safety or compliance, as the most important factor for selecting the bowel preparation formulation.This may be be-cause the degree of bowel cleansing directly influences the completion and complications of colonoscopy.In addition, poor bowel preparation can occur despite good compliance, and the risk of complications from bowel preparation formulation is low.Poor bowel preparation extends the duration of the colonoscopy, increasing patient discomfort and adversely affecting the diagnostic rate of colonic disease.

5 Furthermore, it hinders the cecal insertion rate (greater than 90%), which is an essential component of colonoscopy quality assurance. 12Among the available bowel preparation formulas, the combination of 2-L PEG＋Asc was preferred compared to other formulas because it required a lower ingestion volume than 4-L PEG, while providing similar bowel cleansing potency 7 and better compliance due to improved flavor.

These advantages were also reflected in the responses to this survey.

In patients with severe constipation, most responders preferred to add laxatives such as bisacodyl or to extend the duration of diet control prior to colonoscopy, rather than dividing the dosage of the bowel preparation formulation.While there are reports that restricting dietary fiber leads to improved bowel preparation, 13 there is insufficient evidence of the association between dietary control and the degree of bowel preparation.Adding bisacodyl to standard dosages of bowel preparation formulation has not been thoroughly investigated and the approach remains controversial. 6One domestic study reported that the addition of bisacodyl did not result in a significant difference compared to the conventional bowel preparation protocol. 14In comparison, guidelines published by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommended divided intake of bowel preparation formula since it can improve both compliance and the degree of bowel cleansing.However, this approach was the least preferred method in this survey.

In cases of inadequate bowel preparation on the day of colonoscopy, most preferred to order additional ingestion of the same formula and perform the examination as scheduled, possibly because of difficulty in rescheduling the examination: patients often find it difficult to take another day off from work for a colonoscopy and do not wish to undergo bowel preparation again.The results indicated that 2.7% of the responders chose to administer an extra dose of bowel preparation formula through colonoscopy.Direct administration of the bowel preparation formula to the hepatic flexure with co-lonoscopy requires approximately two hours, and is reported to achieve adequate bowel preparation in 96.2% of patients. 15However, because this is such a time-consuming procedure, it is unfeasible under National Health Service medical reimbursement policy conditions in South Korea.

None of the responders preferred to substitute another diagnostic method for the colonoscopy, such as a double barium contrast or CT colonography.One report indicated that the CT colonography had higher sensitivity than conventional colonoscopy for detecting colorectal carcinoma, 16 although the approach is not as effective for detecting flat lesions, hyperemia, and superficial mucosal erosion.However, this may be an appropriate alternative when colonoscopy fails.

Sodium phosphate solution was removed from the market in 2008 due to demonstrated renal toxicity, and currently only an OSP solution is available. 17A study that compared OSP to 2-L PEG＋Asc concluded that the two formulas were nearly equivalent in efficacy or safety. 18Nonetheless, most physicians reported that they had limited experience prescribing OSP due to concerns that OSP could cause complications similar to the sodium phosphate solution.

Several formulas are available for patients for bowel preparation, and the formula is selected after considering bowel preparation potency, safety, and compliance, among other factors.

This study has several limitations.First, our study is limited in clinical application.This study was designed to investigate the preference on bowel preparation agent and preferred strategies on poor bowel preparation.As it is not an evidence-based study, its results have limited novel value for suggesting clinical application.Second, there is potential bias toward a certain bowel preparation agent since the questionnaire was performed by a private company that markets the agents.While the participants in secondary and tertiary hospitals were directly contacted by the research team once, participants in tertiary hospitals who joined academic meetings were further contacted and asked to respond to preliminary questionnaires to maintain objectiveness.Third, this study compared the differences in colonoscopy practice between tertiary hospitals and private/secondary hospitals.

However, a more detailed sub-analysis could not be done because of private information act policy.Last, this study lacks data on bowel preparation scale such as Boston scale or Otawa scale, resulting in a more subjective analysis of the bowel preparation status.However, this study focused on poorly prepared bowels only, especially the cases that impeded colonoscopy.While a detailed scale was not provided, there would have been little disagreement among endoscopists on the degree of poor bowel preparations of the subjects included in this study.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that conducted a large-scale survey of physicians that prescribe bowel preparation formulations.This investigation allowed us to determine current preferences for bowel preparation and management of poor bowel preparations.While this does not represent the entire population of physicians that perform colonoscopies in South Korea, this study was able to capture current trends in treatment approaches, which is important for establishing guidelines and optimizing outcomes.
