• attending to the word itself, to previous/next words and to the end of the sentence (Raganato and Tiedemann, 2018);

• attending to previous/next tokens,    (Kovaleva et al., 2019) According to Clark et al. (2019), ""attention weight has a clear meaning: how much a particular word will be weighted when computing the next representation for the current word"". However, Kovaleva et al. (2019) showed that most selfattention heads do not directly encode any nontrivial linguistic information, since less than half of them had the ""heterogeneous"" pattern 2 . Much of the model encoded the vertical pattern (attention to [CLS], [SEP], and punctuation tokens), consistent with the observations by Clark et al. (2019). This apparent redundancy must be related to the overparametrization issue (see section 7).

Attention to [CLS] is easy to interpret as attention to an aggregated sentence-level representation, but BERT also attends a lot to [SEP] and punctuation. Clark et al. (2019) hypothesize that periods and commas are simply almost as frequent as [CLS] and [SEP], and the model learns to rely on them. They suggest also that the function of [SEP] might be one of ""no-op"", a signal to ignore the head if its pattern is not applicable to the current case.

[SEP] gets increased attention starting in layer 5, but its importance for prediction drops. If this hypothesis is correct, attention probing studies that excluded the [SEP] and [CLS] tokens (as e.g.  and Htut et al. (2019)) should perhaps be revisited.

Proceeding to the analysis of the ""heterogeneous"" self-attention pattern, a number of studies looked for specific BERT heads with linguistically interpretable functions.

Some BERT heads seem to specialize in certain types of syntactic relations. Htut et al.

(2019) and Clark et al. (2019) report that there are BERT heads that attended significantly more than a random baseline to words in certain syntactic positions. The datasets and methods used in these studies differ, but they both find that there are heads that attend to words in obj role more than the positional baseline. The evidence for nsubj, advmod, and amod has some variation between these two studies. The overall conclusion is also supported by Voita et al. (2019)'s data for the base Transformer in machine translation context. Hoover et al. (2019) hypothesize that even complex dependencies like dobj are encoded by a combination of heads rather than a single head, but this work is limited to qualitative analysis.

Both Clark et al. (2019) and Htut et al. (2019) conclude that no single head has the complete syntactic tree information, in line with evidence of partial knowledge of syntax (see subsection 4.1).  present evidence that attention weights are weak indicators of subjectverb agreement and reflexive anafora. Instead of serving as strong pointers between tokens that should be related, BERT's self-attention weights were close to a uniform attention baseline, but there was some sensitivity to different types of distractors coherent with psycholinguistic data.

Clark et al. (2019) identify a BERT head that can be directly used as a classifier to perform coreference resolution on par with a rule-based system,. Kovaleva et al. (2019) showed that even when attention heads specialize in tracking semantic relations, they do not necessarily contribute to BERT's performance on relevant tasks. Kovaleva et al. (2019) identified two heads of base BERT, in which self-attention maps were closely aligned with annotations of core frame semantic relations (Baker et al., 1998).

It stands to reason that the lower layers have the most linear word order information.  report a decrease in the knowledge of linear word order around layer 4 in BERT-base. This is accompanied by increased knowledge of hierarchical sentence structure, as detected by the probing tasks of predicting the index of a token, the main auxiliary verb and the sentence subject.

There is a wide consensus among studies with different tasks, datasets and methodologies that syntactic information is the most prominent in the middle BERT 3 layers. Hewitt and Manning (2019) had the most success reconstructing syntactic tree depth from the middle BERT layers (6-9 for base-BERT, 14-19 for BERT-large). Goldberg (2019) report the best subject-verb agreement around layers 8-9, and the performance on syntactic probing tasks used by Jawahar et al. (2019) also seemed to peak around the middle of the model.

The prominence of syntactic information in the middle BERT layers must be related to  observation that the middle layers of Transformers are overall the best-performing and the most transferable across tasks (see Figure 5). There is conflicting evidence about syntactic chunks. Tenney et al. (2019a) conclude that ""the basic syntactic information appears earlier in the network while high-level semantic features appears at the higher layers"", drawing parallels between this order and the order of components in a typical NLP pipeline -from POS-tagging to dependency parsing to semantic role labeling. Jawahar et al. (2019) also report that the lower layers were more useful for chunking, while middle layers were more useful for parsing. At the same time, the probing experiments by  find the opposite: both POS-3 These BERT results are also compatible with findings by Vig and Belinkov (2019), who report the highest attention to tokens in dependency relations in the middle layers of  tagging and chunking were also performed best at the middle layers, in both BERT-base and BERTlarge.

The final layers of BERT are the most taskspecific. In pre-training, this means specificity to the MLM task, which would explain why the middle layers are more transferable . In fine-tuning, it explains why the final layers change the most (Kovaleva et al., 2019). At the same time, Hao et al. (2019) report that if the weights of lower layers of the fine-tuned BERT are restored to their original values, it does not dramatically hurt the model performance. Tenney et al. (2019a) suggest that while most of syntactic information can be localized in a few layers, semantics is spread across the entire model, which would explain why certain non-trivial examples get solved incorrectly at first but correctly at higher layers. This is rather to be expected: semantics permeates all language, and linguists debate whether meaningless structures can exist at all (Goldberg, 2006, p.166-182). But this raises the question of what stacking more Transformer layers actually achieves in BERT in terms of the spread of semantic knowledge, and whether that is beneficial. The authors' comparison between base and large BERTs shows that the overall pattern of cumulative score gains is the same, only more spread out in the large BERT.

The above view is disputed by Jawahar et al. (2019), who place ""surface features in lower layers, syntactic features in middle layers and semantic features in higher layers"". However, the conclusion with regards to the semantic features seems surprising, given that only one SentEval semantic task in this study actually topped at the last layer, and three others peaked around the middle and then considerably degraded by the final layers.","[[], ['b5'], ['b5', 'b57', 'b50'], [None, 'b9', 'b50'], ['b5']]","[[], ['b5'], ['b5', 'b57', 'b50'], [None, 'b9', 'b50'], ['b5']]",8,"sent1: The first layer of BERT receives as input representations that are a combination of token, segment, and positional embeddings.

Multiple studies have come up with alternative training objectives to improve on BERT.

• Removing NSP does not hurt or slightly improves task performance (Liu et al., 2019b;Joshi et al., 2020;Clinchant et al., 2019), especially in cross-lingual setting . Wang et al. (2019a) Mikolov et al. (2013b).

• Permutation language modeling. Yang et al. (2019) replace MLM with training on different permutations of word order in the input sequence, maximizing the probability of the original word order. See also the n-gram word order reconstruction task (Wang et al., 2019a).

• Span boundary objective aims to predict a masked span (rather than single words) using only the representations of the tokens at the span's boundary (Joshi et al., 2020);

• Phrase masking and named entity masking  aim to improve representation of structured knowledge by masking entities rather than individual words;

• Continual learning is sequential pre-training on a large number of tasks 4 , each with their own loss which are then combined to continually update the model (Sun et al., 2019b).

• Conditional MLM by  replaces the segmentation embeddings with ""label embeddings"", which also include the label for a given sentence from an annotated task dataset (e.g. sentiment analysis).

• Clinchant et al. (2019) propose replacing the MASK token with [UNK] token, as this could help the model to learn certain representation for unknowns that could be exploited by a neural machine translation model.

Another obvious source of improvement is pretraining data. Liu et al. (2019c) explore the benefits of increasing the corpus volume and longer training. The data also does not have to be unstructured text: although BERT is actively used as a source of world knowledge (subsection 4.3), there are ongoing efforts to incorporate structured knowledge resources .

Another way to integrate external knowledge is use entity embeddings as input, as in E-BERT (Poerner et al., 2019) and ERNIE . Alternatively, SemBERT  integrates semantic role information with BERT representations. Pre-training is the most expensive part of training BERT, and it would be informative to know how much benefit it provides. Hao et al.

Languages with a lot of data were subsampled, and some were super-sampled using exponential smoothing. mBERT performs surprisingly well in zero-shot transfer on many tasks (Wu and Dredze, 2019;Pires et al., 2019), although not in language generation (Rönnqvist et al., 2019). The model seems to naturally learn high-quality cross-lingual word alignments (Libovický et al., 2019), with caveats for open-class parts of speech (Cao et al., 2019). Adding more languages does not seem to harm the quality of representations (Artetxe et al., 2019).

mBERT generalizes across some scripts (Pires et al., 2019), and can retrieve parallel sentences, although Libovický et al. (2019) note that this task could be solvable by simple lexical matches. Pires et al. (2019) conclude that mBERT representation space shows some systematicity in betweenlanguage mappings, which makes it possible in some cases to ""translate"" between languages by shifting the representations by the average parallel sentences offset for a given language pair.

mBERT is simply trained on a multilingual corpus, with no language IDs, but it encodes language identities (Wu and Dredze, 2019;Libovický et al., 2019), and adding the IDs in pre-training was not beneficial . It is also aware of at least some typological language features (Libovický et al., 2019;Singh et al., 2019), and transfer between structurally similar languages works better Pires et al., 2019). Singh et al. (2019) argue that if typological features structure its representation space, it could not be considered as interlingua. However, Artetxe et al. (2019) show that cross-lingual transfer can be achieved by only retraining the input embeddings while keeping monolingual BERT weights, which suggests that even monolingual models learn generalizable linguistic abstractions.

At least some of the syntactic properties of English BERT hold for mBERT: its MLM is aware of 4 types of agreement in 26 languages (Bacon and Regier, 2019), and main auxiliary of the sentence can be detected in German and Nordic languages Rönnqvist et al. (2019). Pires et al. (2019) and Wu and Dredze (2019) hypothesize that shared word-pieces help mBERT, based on experiments where the task performance correlated with the amount of shared vocabulary between languages. However,  dispute this account, showing that bilingual BERT models are not hampered by the lack of shared vocabulary. Artetxe et al. (2019) also show crosslingual transfer is possible by swapping the model Figure 7: Language centroids of the mean-pooled mBERT representations (Libovický et al., 2019) vocabulary, without any shared word-pieces.

To date, the following proposals were made for improving mBERT: As shown in section 4, multiple probing studies report that BERT possesses a surprising amount of syntactic, semantic, and world knowledge. However, as Tenney et al. (2019a) aptly stated, ""the fact that a linguistic pattern is not observed by our probing classifier does not guarantee that it is not there, and the observation of a pattern does not tell us how it is used"". There is also the issue of tradeoff between the complexity of the probe and the tested hypothesis . A more complex probe might be able to recover more information, but it becomes less clear whether we are still talking about the original model.

Furthermore, different probing methods may reveal complementary or even contradictory information, in which case a single test (as done in most studies) would not be sufficient (Warstadt et al., 2019). Certain methods might also favor a certain model, e.g., RoBERTa is trailing BERT with one tree extraction method, but leading with another (Htut et al., 2019).

Head and layer ablation studies (Michel et al., 2019;Kovaleva et al., 2019) inherently assume that certain knowledge is contained in heads/layers, but there is evidence of more diffuse representations spread across the full network: the gradual increase in accuracy on difficult semantic parsing tasks (Tenney et al., 2019a), the absence of heads that would perform parsing ""in general"" (Clark et al., 2019;Htut et al., 2019). Ablations are also problematic if the same information was duplicated elsewhere in the network. To mitigate that, Michel et al. (2019) prune heads in the order set by a proxy importance score, and Voita et al. (2019) fine-tune the pretrained Transformer with a regularized objective that has the head-disabling effect.

Many papers are accompanied by attention visualizations, with a growing number of visualization tools (Vig, 2019;Hoover et al., 2019). However, there is ongoing debate on the merits of attention as a tool for interpreting deep learning models (Jain and Wallace, 2019;Serrano and Smith, 2019;Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019;Brunner et al., 2020).

As stated by Qu et al. (2019a), Conversational QA (and CMC) is a simplified setting of Conversational Search (ConvSearch), an information-seeking, ""System Ask, User Respond"" paradigm (Zhang et al., 2018b), that does not focus on asking proactively. CMC, specifically, tries to address the challenges of NLU, via contextual encoding, reasoning, and handling conversational history, via history selection and modeling. In that aspect, CMC is a concrete enough setting for IR researchers to understand the change of information needs and interactivity between conversational cycles.

Could Commonsense Reasoning improve CMC? Commonsense Reasoning (CR) is based on the set of background information or world knowledge that an individual is intended to know or assume, and may be missing from context. On the other hand, Pragmatic reasoning, which the current CMC models cater to, is based on the derivation of explicit and implicit meanings within the context. The current MRC systems are nearing human performance on most datasets, however, they still perform poorly on single-turn CR based questions (Zhang et al., 2018a). While there is recently increasing interest in CR in the single-turn MRC setting Ostermann et al., 2018;Lin et al., 2017), CMC remains relatively untouched. This may probably be due to the lack of foreknowledge requiring unanswerable questions (e.g. in SQuAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018)) in current CMC datasets (Yatskar, 2019), suggesting a need for more complex CMC datasets that incorporate CR. However, humans annotators may often apply common-sense reasoning involuntarily while answering questions or comprehending, thus leaving room for incorporating CR in models. There seems to be no recent work that invalidates, experimentally, the role of CR in CMC. QuAC, for example, is drawn from articles on personalities, and current models still lag behind the human benchmark. It may be worth experimenting if adding domain knowledge or attributes about the context, like location and gender, help improve answering these questions.

Why did the paper focus on common trends across each component rather than a single overarching classification of CMC models? The study of common trends in modeling, rather than a single overarching classification, helped in providing a multi-faceted view of CMC that can generalize on future models, and identify possible open-ended research questions, such as (a) For history selection, HAM (Qu et al., 2019b) has proved to be both effective and intuitive in selecting relevant history turns.

Contextual Integration using Pre-trained Language Models,"Large-scale pre-trained LMs such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and RoBERTa , have become the current state-of-the-art approaches for contextual reasoning in CMC models, with leaderboards of both datasets stacked with these models or their variants. The approach is based on the fine-tune BERT-based MRC modeling outlined by Devlin et al. (2019), in which question and context are packed together (with marker embeddings to distinguish) in an input sequence to BERT that outputs contextualized question-aware embeddings for each input token.

Using pre-trained models for reasoning is advantageous in two aspects: Firstly, it simplifies the architecture by fusing encoding and reasoning modules into a single module. Secondly, it provides a ready-to-tune architecture that abstracts out complex contextual interactions between query and context while providing sufficient flexibility to control interactivity via augmentation of input embeddings i.e. concatenation of special embeddings to input tokens that signal the model to incorporate a desirable characteristic in contextualization.

(a) HAM uses a dynamic attention-based history selection policy. Contextualized representations are generated by the model's encoder (BERT+PosHAE) for every history turn at word and sequence levels. Sequence-level embeddings are used to compute attention weights via scaled-dot product, and aggregate representations are generated by a weighted combination of embeddings of each turn in the proportion of their attention weights. Thus, attention weights help in determining the degree of selection (relevance) of each history turn.

(b) HAM's BERT based Encoder (Reasoning Architecture) for every conversation turn. The encoder is provided with input sequence consisting of query tokens (yellow) and context tokens (green) separated by [SEP]. It outputs contextualized representations Ti corresponding to aligned question/passage tokens. The Token embeddings are augmented with segment embeddings(to differentiate query and context), positional embeddings (for distinct position in the sequence), and Positional HAE embeddings (for encoding history answer and relative conversational turn). Figure 3: Illustration of (a) history selection module and (b) encoder/reasoning module of History Attention Mechanism (HAM) model (Qu et al., 2019b).

However, incorporating history into these models is a key challenge in this approach as most of the transformer models such as BERT only accept 2 segments ids in the input sequence. Based on recent research in CMC, two main trends in solving the history integration issue are discussed below:

1. Modify the input embeddings for a single-turn MRC model to incorporate history. This is done by either appending the entire conversation to the question, such as Ju et al. (2019) which uses RoBERTa ) as the base model and truncates query if it exceeds the limit, or add special embeddings to highlight conversational history for the model, such as HAE (Qu et al., 2019a) embeds history answer embeddings with each context token if it is present in any of the history turns (detailed in section 6.2). This approach does not effectively use the model to capture interactions between every dialog-turn and context.

2. Use separate model for each conversational turn to capture one-to-one interaction between history and context, and merge the per-turn contextualized embeddings into aggregated history-aware embeddings. Two models follow this trend. Ohsugi et al. (2019) uses BERT models to capture contextual interaction for every question (history and current) and answer (2N+1 sequences for N turns) and concatenates all sequences together. Finally, it runs Bi-GRU (Cho et al., 2014) over the aggregated sequence to capture inter-turn interactions before sending for prediction. On the other hand, HAM (Qu et al., 2019b) ignores the history questions and uses the current question as a query with positional History Answer Embeddings (section 6.2), thus generating one output sequence per conversation turn.

Different trends observed in this respect are described below. Some models may use a combination of these approaches.

1. Appending selected history questions and/or answers (in raw form or text span indices) to the current question before encoding. QA tokens across turns should be distinguishable or separated when appending. Models DrQA+PGNet (Reddy et al., 2019), SDNet  and RoBERTa + AT + KD (Ju et al., 2019) append all history QA pairs separated by tokens like symbols

On the other hand, QuAC baseline model BiDAF++ w/ 2-ctx (Ohsugi et al., 2019) and GraphFlow  append only the history questions to the current question and encode relative dialogturn number within each question embedding to differentiate. Choi et al. (2018) validate that this dialog-turn encoding strategy performs better in practice.

2. Encoding context tokens with history answer marker embeddings (HAE) before passing on for reasoning. These embeddings indicate if the context token is present in any conversational history answer or not, such as in BiDAF++ w/ 2-ctx (Choi et al., 2018), GraphFlow , BERT+HAE (Qu et al., 2019a) and HAM (Qu et al., 2019b). HAM encodes a dialog-turn encoded variant of HAE called Positional HAE. It maintains a lookup table of history embeddings for every relative position from the current conversation and embeds the corresponding embedding if the token is found in that history answer, e.g. for the current question q k if a token is found in history answer a k−2 then Positional HAE embedding at index 2 is encoded, otherwise embedding at index 0 is encoded. This setting is illustrated in Fig. 3b.

3. Integrating intermediate representations generated in the reasoning modules of selected history conversation turns to grasp the deep latent semantics of the history, rather than acting on raw inputs. This approach is also called the FLOW based approach. The models that follow this approach are FlowQA (Huang et al., 2018a), FlowDelta (Yeh and Chen, 2019), and GraphFlow . GraphFlow encodes conversational histories into context graphs which are used by the reasoning module for contextual analysis.

Traditional generative models are mostly based on probabilistic grammars. To enable efficient inference, they typically make one or more relatively strict conditional independence assumptions. The simplest assumption (a.k.a. the context-free assumption) states that the generation of a token is only dependent on its head token and is independent of anything else. Such assumptions make it possible to decompose the joint probability into a product of component probabilities or scores, leading to tractable inference. However, they also lead to unavailability of useful information (e.g., context and generation history) in generating each token.

Based on their respective independence assumptions, different generative models specify different generation processes of the sentence and parse tree. Paskin (2002) and Carroll and Charniak (1992) choose to first uniformly sample a dependency tree skeleton and then populate the tokens (words) conditioned on the dependency tree in a recursive root-to-leaf manner. The generation of a child token is conditioned on the head token and the dependency direction. In contrast, Klein and Manning (2004) propose the Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) that generates the sentence and the parse tree simultaneously. Without knowing the dependency tree structure, each head token has to sample a decision (conditioned on the head token and the dependency direction) of whether to generate a child token or not before actually generating the child token.

However, the marginalized probability cannot usually be calculated accurately for more complex models that do not make strict independence assumption. Instead, a variational autoencoder maximizes the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), a lower bound of the marginalized probability. Since the intermediate representation follows a distribution, different sampling approaches are used to optimize the objective function (i.e., likelihood) according to different model schema.

Three unsupervised dependency parsing models were proposed in recent years based on variational autoencoders (shown in Table 1). There are three probabilities involved in ELBO: the prior probability of the syntactic structure, the probability of generating the sentence from the syntactic structure (the decoder), and the variational posterior (the encoder) from the sentence to the syntactic structure.

Recurrent Neural Network Grammars (RNNG) ) is a transition-based constituent parser, with a discriminative and a generative variant. Discriminative RNNG incrementally constructs the constituency tree of the input sentence through three kinds of operations: generating a non-terminal token, shifting, and reducing. Generative RNNG replaces the shifting operation with a word generation operation and incrementally generates a constituency tree and its corresponding sentence. The probability of each operation is calculated by a neural network. Li et al. (2019) modify RNNG for dependency parsing and use discriminative RNNG and generative RNNG as the encoder and decoder of a variational autoencoder respectively. However, because RNNG has a strong expressive power, it is prone to overfitting in the unsupervised setting. Li et al. (2019) propose to use posterior regularization to introduce linguistic knowledge as a constraint in learning, thereby mitigating this problem to a certain extent.

The model proposed by Corro and Titov (2018) is also based on a variational autoencoder. It is designed for semi-supervised dependency parsing, but in principle it can also be applied for unsupervised dependency parsing. The encoder of this model is a conditional random field model while the decoder generates a sentence based on a graph convolutional neural network whose structure is specified by the dependency tree. Since the variational autoencoder needs Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the gradient and the complexity of sampling a dependency tree is very high, Corro and Titov (2018) use Gumbel random perturbation. Jang et al. (2017) use differentiable dynamic programming to design an efficient approximate sampling algorithm.

The variational variant of D-NDMV (Han et al., 2019a) has the same structure as the deterministic variant described in Section 3.2.1, except that the variational variant probabilistically models the intermediate continuous vector conditioned on the input sentence using a Gaussian distribution.

These labels tend, however, to contain more errors. Even though more training data is available, training directly on this noisily-labeled data can actually hurt the performance. Therefore, many recent approaches for distant supervision use a noise handling method to diminish the negative effects of distant supervision. We categorize these into two ideas: noise filtering and noise modeling.

Noise filtering methods remove instances from the training data that have a high probability of being incorrectly labeled. This often includes training a classifier to make the filtering decision. The filtering can remove the instances completely from the training data, e.g., through a probability threshold (Jia et al., 2019), a binary classifier (Adel and Schütze, 2015; Onoe and Durrett, 2019; Huang and Du, 2019), or the use of a reinforcement-based agent Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019). Alternatively, a soft filtering might be applied that re-weights instances according to their probability of being correctly labeled (Le and Titov, 2019) or an attention measure (Hu et al., 2019).

The noise in the labels can also be modeled. A common model is a confusion matrix estimating the relationship between clean and noisy labels (Fang and Cohn, 2016;Luo et al., 2017;Hedderich and Klakow, 2018;Paul et al., 2019;Lange et al., 2019a,c;Chen et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019;Hedderich et al., 2021b). The classifier is no longer trained directly on the noisily-labeled data. Instead, a noise model is appended which shifts the noisy to the (unseen) clean label distribution. This can be interpreted as the original classifier being trained on a ""cleaned"" version of the noisy labels. In Ye et al. (2019), the prediction is shifted from the noisy to the clean distribution during testing. In Chen et al. (2020a), a group of reinforcement agents relabels noisy instances. Rehbein and Ruppenhofer (2017), Lison et al. (2020) and Ren et al. (2020) leverage several sources of distant supervision and learn how to combine them.

In NER, the noise in distantly supervised labels tends to be false negatives, i.e., mentions of entities that have been missed by the automatic method.

This usually requires the training of multilingual language representations by combining monolingual representations (Lange et al., 2020a) or training a single model for many languages, such as multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or XLM-RoBERTa (Conneau et al., 2020) . These models are trained using unlabeled, monolingual corpora from different languages and can be used in crossand multilingual settings, due to many languages seen during pre-training.

In cross-lingual zero-shot learning, no taskspecific labeled data is available in the low-resource target language. Instead, labeled data from a high-resource language is leveraged. A multilingual model can be trained on the target task in a high-resource language and afterwards, applied to the unseen target languages, such as for named entity recognition ( 2020) proposed adding a minimal amount of target-task and -language data (in the range of 10 to 100 labeled sentences) which resulted in a significant boost in performance for classification in low-resource languages.

The transfer between two languages can be improved by creating a common multilingual embedding space of multiple languages. This is useful for standard word embeddings  as well as pre-trained language models. For example, by aligning the languages inside a single multilin- This alignment is typically done by computing a mapping between two different embedding spaces, such that the words in both embeddings share similar feature vectors after the mapping (Mikolov et al., 2013;Joulin et al., 2018). This allows to use different embeddings inside the same model and helps when two languages do not share the same space inside a single model (Cao et al., 2020). For example, Zhang et al. (2019b) used bilingual representations by creating cross-lingual word embeddings using a small set of parallel sentences between the highresource language English and three low-resource African languages, Swahili, Tagalog, and Somali, to improve document retrieval performance for the African languages.

Open Issues: While these multilingual models are a tremendous step towards enabling NLP in many languages, possible claims that these are universal language models do not hold. For example, mBERT covers 104 and XLM-R 100 languages, which is a third of all languages in Wikipedia as outlined earlier. Further, Wu and Dredze (2020) showed that, in particular, low-resource languages are not well-represented in mBERT. Figure 2 shows which language families with at least 1 million speakers are covered by mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa 2 . In particular, African and American languages are not well-represented within the transformer models, even though millions of people speak these languages. This can be problematic, as languages from more distant language families are less suited for transfer learning, as Lauscher et al.

More recently, a trend emerged of pre-training large embedding models using a language model objective to create contextaware word representations by predicting the next word or sentence.

Using parallel corpora, the unlabeled low-resource data is then aligned to its equivalent in the highresource language where labels can be obtained using the aforementioned classifier. These labels (on the high-resource text) can then be projected back to the text in the low-resource language based on the alignment between tokens in the parallel texts (Yarowsky et al., 2001). This approach can, therefore, be seen as a form of distant supervision specific for obtaining labeled data for lowresource languages. Cross-lingual projections have been applied in low-resource settings for tasks, such as POS tagging and parsing (Täckström et al., 2013;Wisniewski et al., 2014;Plank and Agić, 2018;Eskander et al., 2020). Sources for parallel text can be the OPUS project (Tiedemann, 2012), Bible corpora (Mayer and Cysouw, 2014;Christodoulopoulos and Steedman, 2015) or the recent JW300 corpus (Agić and Vulić, 2019). Instead of using parallel corpora, existing high-resource labeled datasets can also be machine-translated into the low-resource language (Khalil et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019a;Fei et al., 2020;Amjad et al., 2020).

The corresponding labels are obtained through a (semi-)automatic process from an external source of information. For named entity recognition (NER), a list of location names might be obtained from a dictionary and matches of tokens in the text with entities in the list are automatically labeled as locations. Distant supervision was introduced by Mintz et al. (2009) for relation extraction (RE) with extensions on multi-instance (Riedel et al., 2010) and multi-label learning (Surdeanu et al., 2012). It is still a popular approach for information extraction tasks like NER and RE where the external information can be obtained from knowledge bases, gazetteers, dictionaries and other forms of structured knowledge sources (Luo et al., 2017;Hedderich and Klakow, 2018;Deng and Sun, 2019;Alt et al., 2019;Ye et al., 2019;Lange et al., 2019a;Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019;Le and Titov, 2019;Cao et al., 2019;Lison et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2021a). The automatic annotation ranges from simple string matching  to complex pipelines including classifiers and manual steps (Norman et al., 2019). This distant supervision using information from external knowledge sources can be seen as a subset of the more general approach of labeling rules. These encompass also other ideas like reg-ex rules or simple programming functions (Ratner et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2019;Adelani et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2020;Lison et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020;Karamanolakis et al., 2021).

While distant supervision is popular for information extraction tasks like NER and RE, it is less prevalent in other areas of NLP. Nevertheless, distant supervision has also been successfully em-  (2020) build a discourse-structure dataset using guidance from sentiment annotations. For topic classification, heuristics can be used in combination with inputs from other classifiers like NER (Bach et al., 2019) or from entity lists (Hedderich et al., 2020). For some classification tasks, the labels can be rephrased with simple rules into sentences. A pretrained language model then judges the label sentence that most likely follows the unlabeled input (Opitz, 2019;). An unlabeled review, for instance, might be continued with ""It was great/bad"" for obtaining binary sentiment labels.

Open Issues: The popularity of distant supervision for NER and RE might be due to these tasks being particularly suited. There, auxiliary data like entity lists is readily available and distant supervision often achieves reasonable results with simple surface form rules. It is an open question whether a task needs to have specific properties to be suitable for this approach. The existing work on other tasks and the popularity in other fields like image classification (Xiao et al., 2015;Li et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2018;Mahajan et al., 2018; suggests, however, that distant supervision could be leveraged for more NLP tasks in the future.

Distant supervision methods heavily rely on auxiliary data. In a low-resource setting, it might be difficult to obtain not only labeled data but also such auxiliary data. Kann et al. (2020) find a large gap between the performance on high-resource and low-resource languages for POS tagging pointing to the lack of high-coverage and error-free dictionaries for the weak supervision in low-resource languages. This emphasizes the need for evaluating such methods in a realistic setting and avoiding to just simulate restricted access to labeled data in a high-resource language.

While distant supervision allows obtaining labeled data more quickly than manually annotating every instance of a dataset, it still requires human interaction to create automatic annotation techniques or to provide labeling rules. This time and effort could also be spent on annotating more gold label data, either naively or through an active learning scheme. Unfortunately, distant supervision papers rarely provide information on how long the creation took, making it difficult to compare these approaches.

In the computer vision community, this is a popular approach where, e.g., rotating an image is invariant to the classification of an image's content. For text, on the token level, this can be done by replacing words with equivalents, such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017;Dai and Adel, 2020) or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018;Vania et al., 2019). Such replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017;Kobayashi, 2018).

To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts. Operations that (depending on the task) do not change the label include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018;Vania et al., 2019;Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018) and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020). For whole sentences, paraphrasing through backtranslation can be used. This is a popular approach in machine translation where target sentences are back-translated into source sentences (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011;Hoang et al., 2018). An important aspect here is that errors in the source side/features do not seem to have a large negative effect on the generated target text the model needs to predict. It is therefore also used in other text generation tasks like abstract summarization (Parida and Motlicek, 2019) and table-to-text generation (Ma et al., 2019). Back-translation has also been leveraged for text classification (Xie et al., 2020;Hegde and Patil, 2020). This setting assumes, however, the availability of a translation system. Instead, a language model can also be used for augmenting text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020;Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020). It is trained conditioned on a label, i.e., on the subset of the task-specific data with this label. It then generates additional sentences that fit this label. Ding et al. (2020) extend this idea for token level tasks.

Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020). They can, however, also be utilized to augment NLP datasets (Yasunaga et al., 2018;Morris et al., 2020). Instead of manually crafted transformation rules, these methods learn how to apply small perturbations to the input data that do not change the meaning of the text (according to a specific score). This approach is often applied on the level of vector representations. For instance, Grundkiewicz et al. (2019) reverse the augmentation setting by applying transformations that flip the (binary) label. In their case, they introduce errors in correct sentences to obtain new training data for a grammar correction task.

Open Issues: While data augmentation is ubiquitous in the computer vision community and while most of the above-presented approaches are taskindependent, it has not found such widespread use in natural language processing. A reason might be that several of the approaches require an indepth understanding of the language. There is not yet a unified framework that allows applying data augmentation across tasks and languages. Recently, Longpre et al. (2020) hypothesised that data augmentation provides the same benefits as pretraining in transformer models. However, we argue that data augmentation might be better suited to leverage the insights of linguistic or domain experts in low-resource settings when unlabeled data or hardware resources are limited.","[['b46', None, 'b18', 'b49'], ['b55', 'b46', None, 'b9'], [None, 'b60'], [None]]","[['b46', None, 'b18', 'b49'], ['b55', 'b46', None, 'b9'], [None, 'b60'], [None]]",11,"sent1: New instances can be obtained based on existing ones by modifying the features with transformations that do not change the label.

sent6: Operations that (depending on the task) do not change the label include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018;Vania et al., 2019;Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018) and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020).
sent7: For whole sentences, paraphrasing through backtranslation can be used.
sent8: This is a popular approach in machine translation where target sentences are back-translated into source sentences (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011;Hoang et al., 2018).
sent9: An important aspect here is that errors in the source side/features do not seem to have a large negative effect on the generated target text the model needs to predict.
sent10: It is therefore also used in other text generation tasks like abstract summarization (Parida and Motlicek, 2019) and table-to-text generation (Ma et al., 2019).
sent11: Back-translation has also been leveraged for text classification (Xie et al., 2020;Hegde and Patil, 2020).
sent12: This setting assumes, however, the availability of a translation system.
sent13: Instead, a language model can also be used for augmenting text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020;Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020).
sent14: It is trained conditioned on a label, i.e., on the subset of the task-specific data with this label.
sent15: It then generates additional sentences that fit this label.
sent16: Ding et al. (2020) extend this idea for token level tasks.
sent17: Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020).
sent18: They can, however, also be utilized to augment NLP datasets (Yasunaga et al., 2018;Morris et al., 2020).
sent19: Instead of manually crafted transformation rules, these methods learn how to apply small perturbations to the input data that do not change the meaning of the text (according to a specific score).
sent20: This approach is often applied on the level of vector representations.
sent21: For instance, Grundkiewicz et al. (2019) reverse the augmentation setting by applying transformations that flip the (binary) label.
sent22: In their case, they introduce errors in correct sentences to obtain new training data for a grammar correction task.
sent23: Open Issues: While data augmentation is ubiquitous in the computer vision community and while most of the above-presented approaches are taskindependent, it has not found such widespread use in natural language processing.
sent24: A reason might be that several of the approaches require an indepth understanding of the language.
sent25: There is not yet a unified framework that allows applying data augmentation across tasks and languages.
sent26: Recently, Longpre et al. (2020) hypothesised that data augmentation provides the same benefits as pretraining in transformer models.
sent27: However, we argue that data augmentation might be better suited to leverage the insights of linguistic or domain experts in low-resource settings when unlabeled data or hardware resources are limited."

For part-of-speech (POS) tagging, Garrette and Baldridge (2013) limit the time of the annotators to 2 hours resulting in up to 1-2k tokens. Kann et al.

(2020) study languages that have less than 10k labeled tokens in the Universal Dependency project (Nivre et al., 2020) and Loubser and Puttkammer (2020) report that most available datasets for South African languages have 40-60k labeled tokens. The threshold is also task-dependent and more complex tasks might also increase the resource requirements. For text generation,  frame their work as low-resource with 350k labeled training instances. Similar to the task, the resource requirements can also depend on the language. Plank et al. (2016) find that task performance varies between language families given the same amount of limited training data.

Given the lack of a hard threshold for lowresource settings, we see it as a spectrum of resource availability. We, therefore, also argue that more work should evaluate low-resource techniques across different levels of data availability for better comparison between approaches. For instance, Plank et al. (2016) and Melamud et al. (2019) show that for very small datasets non-neural methods outperform more modern approaches while the latter obtain better performance in resource-lean scenarios once a few hundred labeled instances are available.","[[], ['b13', 'b0'], ['b13', None]]","[[], ['b13', 'b0'], ['b13', None]]",4,"sent1: On the dimension of task-specific labels, different thresholds are used to define low-resource.

Below, we describe some work that follows these formulations.

Misconceptions Hossain et al. (2020) focused on detecting misinformation related to COVID-19, based on known misconceptions listed in Wikipedia. They evaluated the veracity of a tweet depending on whether it agrees, disagrees, or has no stance with respect to a set of misconceptions. A related formulation of the task is detecting previously fact-checked claims (Shaar et al., 2020). This allows to assess the veracity of dubious content by evaluating the stance of a claim regarding already checked stories, known misconceptions, and facts.

Media Profiling Stance detection has also been used for media profiling. Stefanov et al. (2020) explored the feasibility of an unsupervised approach for identifying the political leanings (left, center, or right bias) of media outlets and influential people on Twitter based on their stance on controversial topics. They built clusters of users around core vocal ones based on their behaviour on Twitter such as retweeting, using the procedure proposed by Darwish et al. (2020).

The reliability of entire news media sources has been automatically rated based on their stance with respect to manually fact-checked claims, without access to gold labels for the overall medium-level factuality of reporting (Mukherjee and Weikum, 2015;Popat et al., 2017Popat et al., , 2018. The assumption in such methods is that reliable media agree with true claims and disagree with false ones, while for unreliable media, the situation is reversed. The trustworthiness of Web sources has also been studied from a data analytics perspective, e.g., Dong et al. (2015) proposed that a trustworthy source is one that contains very few false claims.

More recently, Baly et al. (2018a) used gold labels from Media Bias/Fact Check, 5 and a variety of information sources: articles published by the medium, what is said about the medium on Wikipedia, metadata from its Twitter profile, URL structure, and traffic information. In follow-up work, Baly et al. (2019) used the same representation to jointly predict a medium's factuality of reporting (high vs. mixed vs. low) and its bias (left vs. center vs. right) on an ordinal scale, in a multi-task ordinal regression setup.  (Nakov et al., 2021) for a recent survey on media profiling.

There is a well-known connection between factuality and bias. 6 For example, hyper-partisanship is often linked to low trustworthiness (Potthast et al., 2018), e.g., appealing to emotions rather than sticking to the facts, while center media tend to be generally more impartial and also more trustworthy.

User Profiling In the case of social media and community fora, it is important to model the trustworthiness of the user. In particular, there has been research on finding opinion manipulation trolls, paid (Mihaylov et al., 2015b) or just perceived (Mihaylov et al., 2015a), sockpuppets (Maity et al., 2017Kumar et al., 2017), Internet water army (Chen et al., 2013), and seminar users (Darwish et al., 2017).","[[], [None], ['b32'], ['b17', None], [], ['b13', 'b14', 'b0', None], ['b16'], ['b15'], [None]]","[[], [None], ['b32'], ['b17', None], [], ['b13', 'b14', 'b0', None], ['b16'], ['b15'], [None]]",11,"sent1: Beyond the approaches that we outlined in Section 3.2, stance has also been used for detecting misconceptions and for profiling media sources as part of a fact-checking pipeline.

The FEVER 2.0 task formulation (Thorne et al., 2019) can be viewed as a step towards obtaining such explanations, e.g., there have been efforts to identify adversarial triggers that offer explanations for the vulnerabilities at the model level (Atanasova et al., 2020b). However, FEVER is artificially created and is limited to Wikipedia, which may not reflect real-world settings. To mitigate this, explanation by professional journalists can be found on fact-checking websites, and can be further combined with stance detection in an automated system. In a step in this direction, Atanasova et al. (2020a) generated natural language explanations for claims from PolitiFact 4 given gold evidence document summaries by journalists.

Moreover, partial explanations can be obtained automatically from the underlying models, e.g., from memory networks (Mohtarami et al., 2018), attention weights (Zhou et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b), or topic relations (Si et al., 2021). However, such approaches are limited as they can require gold snippets justifying the document's stance, attention weights can be misleading (Jain and Wallace, 2019), and topics might be noisy due to their unsupervised nature. Other existing systems (Popat et al., 2017(Popat et al., , 2018Nadeem et al., 2019) offer explanations to a more limited extent, highlighting span overlaps between the target text and the evidence documents. Overall, there is a need for holistic and realistic explanations of how a factchecking model arrived at its prediction.

Integration People question false information more and tend to confirm true information (Mendoza et al., 2010). Thus, stance can play a vital role in verifying dubious content. In Appendix C, we discuss existing systems and real-world applications of stance for mis-and disinformation identification in more detail. However, we argue that a tighter integration between stance and factchecking is needed. Stance can be expressed in different forms, e.g., tweets, news articles, user posts, sentences in Wikipedia, and Wiki tables, among others and can have different formulations as part of the fact-checking pipeline (see Section 3). All these can guide human fact-checkers through the process of fact-checking, and can point them to relevant evidence. Moreover, the wisdom of the crowd can be a powerful instrument in the fight against mis-and disinformation (Pennycook and Rand, 2019), but we should note that vocal minorities can derail public discourse (Scannell et al., 2021).

For example, fact-checking often goes beyond binary true/false labels, e.g., Nakov et al. (2018) used a third category half-true, Rashkin et al. (2017) included mixed and no factual evidence, and Wang (2017); Santia and Williams (2018) adopted an even finer-grained schema with six labels, including barely true and utterly false.

In fact, fine-grained labels are common for the related task of Sentiment Analysis (Pang and Lee, 2005;Rosenthal et al., 2017).

Moreover, adding label granularity can further improve the transfer between datasets, as the stance labels already share some semantic similarities, but there can be mismatches in the label definitions (Schiller et al., 2021;Hardalov et al., 2021Hardalov et al., , 2022.","[['b20', 'b3', 'b9', 'b18'], [None, 'b25']]","[['b20', 'b3', 'b9', 'b18'], [None, 'b25']]",6,"sent1: The notion of shades of truth is important in mis-and disinformation detection.

Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1. One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.

Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t. the target claim.

More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).

Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER . To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score. Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points. Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70. Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.

Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"". Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).

Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.

Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.

These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).

A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).

Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.

Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.

Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.","[[], [None, 'b19'], [], ['b31'], [None], ['b51', 'b30', 'b52', 'b8', 'b50', None, 'b47', 'b43'], [None], [], [None, 'b57'], ['b55', 'b36', None, 'b49'], [None, 'b57', 'b49'], [None, 'b38'], [], ['b24', None, 'b25']]","[[], [None, 'b19'], [], ['b31'], [None], ['b51', 'b30', 'b52', 'b8', 'b50', None, 'b47', 'b43'], [None], [], [None, 'b57'], ['b55', 'b36', None, 'b49'], [None, 'b57', 'b49'], [None, 'b38'], [], ['b24', None, 'b25']]",27,"sent1: In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1.
sent2: One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance.
sent3: Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead.
sent4: In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a).
sent5: Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help.
sent6: Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful.
sent7: All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance.
sent8: In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1).
sent9: Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general.
sent10: This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.
sent11: Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents.
sent12: Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t.
sent13: the target claim. More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.
sent14: Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help.
sent15: In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree.
sent16: The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings.
sent17: For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT.
sent18: Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets.
sent19: Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).
sent20: Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER .
sent21: To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted.
sent22: The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021).
sent23: Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score.
sent24: Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points.
sent25: Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70.

2 What is Stance?

In order to understand the task of stance detection, we first provide definitions of stance and the stance-taking process. Biber and Finegan (1988) define stance as the expression of a speaker's standpoint and judgement towards a given proposition. Further, Du Bois (2007)) define stance as ""a public act by a social actor, achieved dialogically through overt communicative means, of simultaneously evaluating objects, positioning subjects (self and others), and aligning with other subjects, with respect to any salient dimension of the sociocultural field"", showing that the stance-taking process is affected not only by personal opinions, but also by other external factors such as cultural norms, roles in the institution of the family, etc. Here, we adopt the general definition of stance detection by Küçük and Can (2020): ""for an input in the form of a piece of text and a target pair, stance detection is a classification problem where the stance of the author of the text is sought in the form of a category label from this set: Favor, Against, Neither. Occasionally, the category label of Neutral is also added to the set of stance categories (Mohammad et al., 2016), and the target may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the text"" (Augenstein et al., 2016;Mohammad et al., 2016). Note that the stance detection definitions and the label inventories vary somewhat, depending on the target application (see Section 3).

Finally, stance detection can be distinguished from several other closely related NLP tasks: (i) biased language detection, where the existence of an inclination or tendency towards a particular perspective within a text is explored, (ii) emotion recognition, where the goal is to recognise emotions such as love, anger, etc. in the text, (iii) perspective identification, which aims to find the pointof-view of the author (e.g., Democrat vs. Republican) and the target is always explicit, (iv) sarcasm detection, where the interest is in satirical or ironic pieces of text, often written with the intent of ridicule or mockery, and (v) sentiment analysis, which checks the polarity of a piece of text.","[['b12', 'b17', 'b57', None], [], [None], []]","[['b12', 'b17', 'b57', None], [], [None], []]",5,"sent1: Context Evidence #Instances Task English Datasets Rumour Has It (Qazvinian et al., 2011)

Vosoughi et al. (2018a) further found that fake information spreads faster than factual one, thus advocating for the use of temporal information.

Propagation networks can be homogeneous or heterogeneous (e.g., encompassing news articles, publishers, users, and posts) and they can be analyzed at different scales (e.g., node-level, ego-level, triad-level, community-level and the overall network, as shown in Figure 3, in Appendix) (Zhou and Zafarani, 2019). Shu et al. (2020) tackled the fake news classification task by proposing an approach based on hierarchical propagation networks. At both micro-and macro-scale, they extracted and jointly considered network features, temporal features, and linguistic features. Experiments on PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets revealed that temporal features have maximum contribution, followed by network and linguistic features. Shu et al. (2019) provided one of the most thorough multimodal frameworks for fake news classification. Their experimental results suggest that social context (i.e., network-derived) features are more informative than news content ones. Vosoughi et al. (2017) proposed Rumor Gauge, a system that jointly exploits temporal and propagation features, in conjunction with linguistic and user credibility features, for checking the veracity of rumors. In particular, Rumor Gauge leverages text, and network propagation. The temporal modality does not directly provide features, but is instead considered by recomputing all other features at regular time steps, thus yielding multiple time series. Results by Vosoughi et al. (2017) and Kwon et al. (2017) also demonstrated that the contribution of the different data modalities change over time.

To mitigate the ""cold start"" problem of propagation-based early detection of fake news, Liu and Wu (2018) proposed an approach that is primarily based on user and temporal information. First, they built a propagation path of each news as a time series of user representations. The time series for a given news only contains the ordered representations of those users that shared such news. Then, they learned two vector representations of each propagation path via GRUs and CNNs, respectively. Zannettou et al. (2018) analyzed different aspects of memes, such as how they evolve and propagate in different mainstream and fringe web communities, and variants of memes that propa-gate. Finally, Nguyen et al. (2020) proposed Factual News Graph (FANG) to exploit the social structure and the engagement patterns of users for fake news detection.","[['b72', 'b53'], ['b55', 'b57', 'b90', 'b8', 'b71'], ['b29', 'b16', 'b84']]","[['b72', 'b53'], ['b55', 'b57', 'b90', 'b8', 'b71'], ['b29', 'b16', 'b84']]",10,"sent1: The rationale for leveraging network information stems from early work (Shao et al., 2018;Vosoughi et al., 2018a) that showed that propagation and interaction networks of fake news are deeper and wider than those of real news.

sent14: Results by Vosoughi et al. (2017) and Kwon et al. (2017) also demonstrated that the contribution of the different data modalities change over time.
sent15: To mitigate the ""cold start"" problem of propagation-based early detection of fake news, Liu and Wu (2018) proposed an approach that is primarily based on user and temporal information.
sent16: First, they built a propagation path of each news as a time series of user representations.
sent17: The time series for a given news only contains the ordered representations of those users that shared such news.
sent18: Then, they learned two vector representations of each propagation path via GRUs and CNNs, respectively.
sent19: Zannettou et al. (2018) analyzed different aspects of memes, such as how they evolve and propagate in different mainstream and fringe web communities, and variants of memes that propa-gate.

B Modeling Techniques Figure 4 shows various multimodal approaches that have been proposed in the literature.

C Lessons Learned 1. A lot of progress has been made on the problem, but the two components in the definition of disinformation (falseness and harmfulness) have been considered mostly in isolation. We argue that there is a need for tight integration of the factuality and the intentional harmfulness into the same detection model. These two aspects have been addressed together in (Alam et al., 2021), which shows that 56% of Arabic false content is also harmful. From Tables 1 and 2, we observe that most multimodal datasets cover just 2-3 modalities, which combine some approaches depicted in Figure 4. Moreover, no multimodal dataset looks at both aspects of disinformation: factuality and harmfulness. While Alam et al.

(2021) did address both aspects, they only covered the text modality.

2. In the early phase of (dis)information spreading, user and content features are those that provide the highest contribution for detecting factuality. Indeed, at that time, a few interactions with content are available and the propagation network is small and sparse. As information spreads, the contribution of content-derived features remains constant, while propagation-derived features become richer and more informative. In summary, early prediction of factuality and veracity must necessarily rely heavily on users and content -be it text, image, audio or video. Instead, analyses carried out at later times benefit more from network and temporal data. In the past decade, research on multimodality has shown its potential in several fields, which include audio-visual fusion (Mroueh et al., Figure 3: Example of social network with users. Node: A node can be a users or a spreader. Ego: ""Ego"" is an individual ""focal"" node (central user) and the nodes that are directly connected to it are called ""alters/spreaders.""

Hosseinmardi et al. (2015) investigated Instagram images and their associated comments for detecting cyberbullying and online harassment. They developed a manually labeled dataset using CrowdFlower (which is now Appen), where they followed standard procedures for the annotation: using annotation guidelines, qualification tests, gold standard evaluation and quality control criteria such as minimum annotation time. The annotated dataset consists of 998 media sessions (images and their associated comments). A key finding of this study is that a large fraction of the annotated posts (48%) with a high percentage of negative words have not been labeled as cyberbullying. To train and to evaluate the model, the authors used n-grams from text, meta-data (e.g., the number of followers, followees, likes, and shared media), and image categories as features and experimented with Naïve Bayes and SVM classifiers. Their study suggests that combining multiple modalities helps to improve the performance of the SVM classifier.

Hate speech is another important problem that spreads over social media. The ""Hateful Memes Challenge"" is an important milestone to advance the research on this topic and the tasks is to detect hateful memes (Kiela et al., 2020). Das et al. (2020) proposed different approaches for hatefulness detection in memes such as (i) extract the caption and include this information with the multimodal model, (ii) use sentiment as an additional feature with multimodal representations. For hate speech detection, Yang et al. (2019a) explored different fusion techniques such as concatenation, bilinear, gated summation, and attention, and reported that combining the text with image embedding boosted the performance in all cases. Vijayaraghavan et al. (2021) proposed methods for interpreting multimodal hate speech detection models, where the modalities consist of text and socio-cultural information rather than images. Concurrently, Gomez et al. (2020) introduced a larger dataset of 150K tweets for multimodal hate speech detection, consisting of six labels.

Propaganda is another topic that has been explored in multimodal settings. Seo (2014) showed how Twitter was used as a propaganda tool during the 2012 Gaza conflict to build international support for each side of the conflict. Dimitrov et al. (2021b) addressed the detection of persuasion techniques in memes. Their analysis of the dataset showed that while propaganda is not always factually false or harmful, most memes are used to damage the reputation of a person or a group of people. Dimitrov et al.

Models Combining Multiple Modalities. The major challenge is to devise a mechanism to combine multiple modalities in a systematic way so that one modality complements the others. Current stateof-the-art primarily adopts early and late fusion, which are limited and do not always yield strong results (Dimitrov et al., 2021a). Very recently, jointly trained multimodal transformer-based models (e.g., ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019), Visual BERT (Lin et al., 2014) and Multimodal Bitransformers (MMBT) (Kiela et al., 2019)) have shown strong potential (Dimitrov et al., 2021b,a;Kiela et al., 2020). However, such models are trained considering only two modalities (textual and visual), while fact-checking or disinformation-related content consists of more than two modalities e.g., text, speech, video, network, etc. (Baly et al., 2020). Hence, there is a room for improvement in developing multimodal models that involve additional, and potentially more than two modalities. Another important problem is cross-modal inconsistency in social media content, as shown in Figure 2(c), which poses a challenge in a multimodal setting (Tan et al., 2020). Datasets. One of the major challenges when working with such diverse modalities, i.e., text, image, speech, video, and network, is to get access to an appropriate dataset, and moreover to one that considers both factuality and harmfulness. Furthermore, there is a need to integrate data from multiple platforms (e.g., news, posts from Twitter, Reddit and Instagram) as different data sources present different styles and focus on different topics.","[[None], ['b17', 'b14', 'b37', None, 'b65', 'b2', 'b1']]","[[None], ['b17', 'b14', 'b37', None, 'b65', 'b2', 'b1']]",8,"sent1: Recently, several initiatives were undertaken by major companies and government entities to combat disinformation in social media (DIGI, 2021). 5

Out of the 15 papers we surveyed, 5 used the 20Newsgroups dataset (Lang, 1995) as a case study, since it has lots of natural artifacts. For example, some punctuation marks appear more often in one class due to the writing styles of the authors contributing to the class, so the model uses these punctuation marks as clues to make predictions. However, because 20Newsgroups is a topic classification dataset, a better model should focus more on the topic of the content since the punctuation marks can also appear in other classes, especially when we apply the model to texts in the wild. Apart from classification performance drops, natural artifacts can also cause model biases, as shown in (De-Arteaga et al., 2019;Park et al., 2018) and debugged in (Lertvittayakumjorn et al., 2020;Yao et al., 2021).

In the absence of strong natural artifacts, bugs can still be simulated using several techniques. First, using only a small subset of labeled data (SS) for training could cause the model to exploit spurious correlation leading to poor performance (Kulesza et al., 2010). Second, injecting wrong labels (WL) into the training data can obviously blunt the model quality (Koh and Liang, 2017). Third, using out-of-distribution tests (OD) can reveal that the model does not work effectively in the domains that it has not been trained on (Lertvittayakumjorn et al., 2020;Yao et al., 2021). All of these techniques give rise to undesirable model behaviors, requiring debugging. Another technique, not found in Table 1 but suggested in related work (Idahl et al., 2021), is contaminating input texts in the training data with decoys (i.e., injected artifacts) which could deceive the model into predicting for the wrong reasons.

Explanation scopes. Basically, there are two main types of explanations that could be provided to feedback providers. Local explanations (L) explain the predictions by the model for individual inputs. In contrast, global explanations (G) explain the model overall, independently of any specific inputs. It can be seen from Table 1 that most existing work use local explanations. One reason for this may be that, for complex models, global explanations can hardly reveal details of the models' inner workings in a comprehensible way to users. So, some bugs are imperceptible in such highlevel global explanations and then not corrected by the users. For example, the debugging framework FIND, proposed by Lertvittayakumjorn et al. (2020), uses only global explanations, and it was shown to work more effectively on significant bugs (such as gender bias in abusive language detection) than on less-obvious bugs (such as dataset shift between product types of sentiment analysis on product reviews). Otherwise, Ribeiro et al. (2018b) presented adversarial replacement rules as global explanations to reveal the model weaknesses only, without explaining how the whole model worked.

On the other hand, using local explanations has limitations in that it demands a large amount of effort from feedback providers to inspect the explanation of every single example in the training/validation set. With limited human resources, efficient ways to rank or select examples to explain would be required (Idahl et al., 2021). Recently, some work in explainable AI considers generating explanations for a group of predictions (Johnson et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020) (e.g., for all the false positives of a certain class), thus staying in the middle of the two extreme explanation types (i.e., local and global). This kind of explanation is not too fine-grained, yet it can capture some suspicious model behaviors if we target the right group of examples. So, it would be worth studying in the context of EBHD (to the best of our knowledge, no existing study experiments with it).

Generating explanations. To generate explanations in general, there are two important questions we need to answer. First, which format should the explanations have? Second, how do we generate the explanations?

For the first question, we see many possible answers in the literature of explainable NLP (e.g., see the survey by Danilevsky et al. (2020)). For instance, input-based explanations (so called feature importance explanations) identify parts of the input that are important for the prediction. The explanation could be a list of importance scores of words in the input, so called attribution scores or relevance scores (Lundberg and Lee, 2017; Arras et al., 2016). Example-based explanations select influential, important, or similar examples from the training set to explain why the model makes a specific prediction (Han et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2020). Rule-based explanations provide interpretable decision rules that approximate the prediction process (Ribeiro et al., 2018a). Adversarial-based explanations return the smallest changes in the inputs that could change the predictions, revealing the model misbehavior (Zhang et al., 2020a). In most NLP tasks, inputbased explanations are the most popular approach for explaining predictions (Bhatt et al., 2020). This is also the case for EBHD as most selected studies use input-based explanations (Kulesza et al., 2009(Kulesza et al., , 2010Teso and Kersting, 2019;Cho et al. For the second question, there are two ways to generate the explanations: self-explaining methods and post-hoc explanation methods. Some models, e.g., Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and decision trees, are self-explaining (SE) (Danilevsky et al., 2020), also referred to as transparent (Adadi and Berrada, 2018) or inherently interpretable (Rudin, 2019). Local explanations of self-explaining models can be obtained at the same time as predictions, usually from the process of making those predictions, while the models themselves can often serve directly as global explanations. For example, feature importance explanations for a Naive Bayes model can be directly derived from the likelihood terms in the Naive Bayes equation, as done by several papers in Table 1 (Kulesza et al., 2009;Smith-Renner et al., 2020). Also, using attention scores on input as explanations, as done in (Cho et al., 2019), is a self-explaining method because the scores were obtained during the prediction process.

In contrast, post-hoc explanation methods (PH) perform additional steps to extract explanations after the model is trained (for a global explanation) or after the prediction is made (for a local explanation). If the method is allowed to access model parameters, it may calculate word relevance scores by propagating the output scores back to the input words (Arras et al., 2016) or analyzing the derivative of the output with respect to the input words (Smilkov et al., 2017;Sundararajan et al., 2017). If the method cannot access the model parameters, it may perturb the input and see how the output changes to estimate the importance of the altered parts of the input (Ribeiro et al., 2016;Jin et al., 2020). The important words and/or the relevance scores can be presented to the feedback providers in the EBHD workflow in many forms such as a list of words and their scores (Teso and Kersting, 2019;Ribeiro et al., 2016), word clouds (Lertvittayakumjorn et al., 2020), and a parse tree (Yao et al., 2021). Meanwhile, the influence functions method, used in (Koh and Liang, 2017;Zylberajch et al., 2021), identifies training examples which influence the prediction by analyzing how the prediction would change if we did not have each training point. This is another post-hoc explanation method as it takes place after prediction. It is similar to the other two example-based explanation methods used in (Khanna et al., 2019;Han and Ghosh, 2020).

Presenting explanations. It is important to carefully design the presentation of explanations, taking into consideration the background knowledge, desires, and limits of the feedback providers. In the debugging application by Kulesza et al. (2009), lay users were asked to provide feedback to email categorizations predicted by the system. The users were allowed to ask several Why questions (inspired by Myers et al. (2006)) through either the menu bar, or by right-clicking on the object of interest (such as a particular word). Examples include ""Why will this message be filed to folder A?"", ""Why does word x matter to folder B?"". The system then responded by textual explanations (generated using templates), together with visual explanations such as bar plots for some types of questions. All of these made the interface become more user-friendly. In 2015, Kulesza et al. proposed, as desirable principles, that the presented explanations should be sound (i.e., truthful in describing the underlying model), complete (i.e., not omitting important information about the model), but not overwhelming (i.e., remaining comprehensible). However, these principles are challenging especially when working on non-interpretable complex models.","[[], ['b51', 'b30'], [None], [], ['b23', 'b5', 'b55', 'b50', 'b24', 'b62', None, 'b67', 'b25', 'b74', 'b8', 'b1'], ['b72', 'b30', 'b49', 'b5', None, 'b77', 'b16', 'b19', 'b65', 'b67'], ['b24', None, 'b40']]","[[], ['b51', 'b30'], [None], [], ['b23', 'b5', 'b55', 'b50', 'b24', 'b62', None, 'b67', 'b25', 'b74', 'b8', 'b1'], ['b72', 'b30', 'b49', 'b5', None, 'b77', 'b16', 'b19', 'b65', 'b67'], ['b24', None, 'b40']]",28,"sent1: The main role of explanations here is to provide interpretable insights into the model and uncover its potential misbehavior or irrationality, which sometimes cannot be noticed by looking at the model outputs or the evaluation metrics.

For the second question, there are two ways to generate the explanations: self-explaining methods and post-hoc explanation methods. Some models, e.g., Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and decision trees, are self-explaining (SE) (Danilevsky et al., 2020), also referred to as transparent (Adadi and Berrada, 2018) or inherently interpretable (Rudin, 2019).
sent27: Local explanations of self-explaining models can be obtained at the same time as predictions, usually from the process of making those predictions, while the models themselves can often serve directly as global explanations.
sent28: For example, feature importance explanations for a Naive Bayes model can be directly derived from the likelihood terms in the Naive Bayes equation, as done by several papers in Table 1 (Kulesza et al., 2009;Smith-Renner et al., 2020).
sent29: Also, using attention scores on input as explanations, as done in (Cho et al., 2019), is a self-explaining method because the scores were obtained during the prediction process.
sent30: In contrast, post-hoc explanation methods (PH) perform additional steps to extract explanations after the model is trained (for a global explanation) or after the prediction is made (for a local explanation).
sent31: If the method is allowed to access model parameters, it may calculate word relevance scores by propagating the output scores back to the input words (Arras et al., 2016) or analyzing the derivative of the output with respect to the input words (Smilkov et al., 2017;Sundararajan et al., 2017).
sent32: If the method cannot access the model parameters, it may perturb the input and see how the output changes to estimate the importance of the altered parts of the input (Ribeiro et al., 2016;Jin et al., 2020).
sent33: The important words and/or the relevance scores can be presented to the feedback providers in the EBHD workflow in many forms such as a list of words and their scores (Teso and Kersting, 2019;Ribeiro et al., 2016), word clouds (Lertvittayakumjorn et al., 2020), and a parse tree (Yao et al., 2021).
sent34: Meanwhile, the influence functions method, used in (Koh and Liang, 2017;Zylberajch et al., 2021), identifies training examples which influence the prediction by analyzing how the prediction would change if we did not have each training point.
sent35: This is another post-hoc explanation method as it takes place after prediction.
sent36: It is similar to the other two example-based explanation methods used in (Khanna et al., 2019;Han and Ghosh, 2020).
sent37: Presenting explanations. It is important to carefully design the presentation of explanations, taking into consideration the background knowledge, desires, and limits of the feedback providers.
sent38: In the debugging application by Kulesza et al. (2009), lay users were asked to provide feedback to email categorizations predicted by the system.
sent39: The users were allowed to ask several Why questions (inspired by Myers et al. (2006)) through either the menu bar, or by right-clicking on the object of interest (such as a particular word).
sent40: Examples include ""Why will this message be filed to folder A?"", ""Why does word x matter to folder B?"".
sent41: The system then responded by textual explanations (generated using templates), together with visual explanations such as bar plots for some types of questions.
sent42: All of these made the interface become more user-friendly.
sent43: In 2015, Kulesza et al. proposed, as desirable principles, that the presented explanations should be sound (i.e., truthful in describing the underlying model), complete (i.e., not omitting important information about the model), but not overwhelming (i.e., remaining comprehensible).
sent44: However, these principles are challenging especially when working on non-interpretable complex models."

Some existing work asked humans to confirm or correct machine-computed explanations. Hence, the form of feedback fairly depends on the form of the explanations, and in turn this shapes how to update the model too (discussed in section 2.2.3). For text classification, most EBHD papers asked humans to decide which words (WO) in the explanation (considered important by the model) are in fact relevant or irrelevant (Kulesza et al., 2010;Ribeiro et al., 2016;Teso and Kersting, 2019). Some papers even allowed humans to adjust the word importance scores (WS) (Kulesza et al., 2009(Kulesza et al., , 2015. This is analogous to specifying relevancy scores for example-based explanations (ES) in (Zylberajch et al., 2021). Meanwhile, feedback at the level of learned features (FE) (i.e., the internal neurons in the model) and learned rules (RU) rather than individual words, was asked in (Lertvittayakumjorn et al., 2020) and (Ribeiro et al., 2018b), respectively. Additionally, humans may be asked to check the predicted labels (Kulesza et al., 2009;Smith-Renner et al., 2020) or even the ground truth labels (collectively noted as LB in Ta It is likely that identifying important parts in the input is sufficient to make the model accomplish simple text classification tasks. However, this might not be enough for complex tasks which require reasoning. Recently, Yao et al. (2021) asked humans to provide, as feedback, compositional explanations to show how the humans would reason (RE) about the models' failure cases. An example of the feedback for a hate speech detection is ""Because X is the word dumb, Y is a hateful word, and X is directly before Y , the attribution scores of both X and Y as well as the interaction score between X and Y should be increased"". To acquire richer information like this as feedback, their framework requires more expertise from the feedback providers. In the future, it would be interesting to explore how we can collect and utilize other forms of feedback, e.g., natural language feedback (Camburu et al., 2018), new training examples (Fiebrink et al., 2009), and other forms of decision rules used by humans (Carstens and Toni, 2017).","[['b51', 'b22', 'b72', 'b23', 'b30', 'b49', 'b11', 'b62', 'b24', 'b77', None, 'b12', 'b67']]","[['b51', 'b22', 'b72', 'b23', 'b30', 'b49', 'b11', 'b62', 'b24', 'b77', None, 'b12', 'b67']]",13,"sent1: After seeing explanations, humans generally desire to improve the model by giving feedback (Smith-Renner et al., 2020).

Another cause of frustration is the risk of detailed explanations overloading users (Narayanan et al., 2018).

The selected participants could be people without ML/NLP knowledge (Kulesza et al., 2010(Kulesza et al., , 2015 or with ML/NLP knowledge (Ribeiro et al., 2018b;Zylberajch et al., 2021) depending on the study objectives and the complexity of the feedback process. Early work even conducted experiments with the participants in-person Kulesza et al., 2009Kulesza et al., , 2015. Although this limited the number of participants (to less than 100), the researchers could closely observe their behaviors and gain some insights concerning humancomputer interaction.

By contrast, some used a crowdsourcing platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk 5 in particular, to collect human feedback for debugging the models. Crowdsourcing (CS) enables researchers to conduct experiments at a large scale; however, the quality of human responses could be varying. So, it is important to ensure some quality control such as specifying required qualifications (Smith-Renner et al., 2020), using multiple annotations per question (Lertvittayakumjorn et al., 2020), having a training phase for participants, and setting up some obvious questions to check if the participants are paying attention to the tasks (Egelman et al., 2014).

Finally, simulation (SM), without real humans involved but using oracles as human feedback instead, has also been considered (for the purpose of testing the EBHD framework only). For example, Teso and Kersting (2019) set 20% of input words as relevant using feature selection. These were used to respond to post-hoc explanations, i.e., top k words selected by LIME. Koh and Liang (2017) simulated mislabeled examples by flipping the labels of a random 10% of the training data. So, when the explanation showed suspicious training examples, the true labels could be used to provide feedback. Compared to the other settings, simulation is faster and cheaper, yet its results may not reflect the effectiveness of the framework when deployed with real humans.

Prior to the emerging of EBHD, studies found that humans are not willing to be constantly asked about labels of examples as if they were just simple oracles (Cakmak et al., 2010;Guillory and Bilmes, 2011). Rather, they want to provide more than just data labels after being given explanations (Amershi et al., 2014;Smith-Renner et al., 2020). By collecting free-form feedback from users, Ghai et al. (2021) discovered various feedback types. The most prominent ones include removing-adding features (words), tuning weights, and leveraging feature combinations.  further analyzed categories of background knowledge underlying the feedback and found, in their experiment, that it was mainly based on commonsense knowledge and English language knowledge. Such knowledge may not be efficiently injected into the model if we exploit human feedback which contains only labels. This agrees with some participants, in (Smith-Renner et al., 2020), who described their feedback as inadequate when they could only confirm or correct predicted labels.

Although human feedback beyond labels contains helpful information, it is naturally neither complete nor precise. Ghai et al. (2021) observed that human feedback usually focuses on a few features that are most different from human expectation, ignoring the others. Also, they found that humans, especially lay people, are not good at correcting model explanations quantitatively (e.g., adjusting weights).

It has been discussed widely that explanations engender human trust in AI systems (Pu and Chen, 2006;Lipton, 2018;Toreini et al., 2020). This trust may be misplaced at times. Showing more detailed explanations can cause users to over rely on the system, leading to misuse where users agree with incorrect system predictions (Stumpf et al., 2016). Moreover, some users may over trust the explanations (without fully understanding them) only because the tools generating them are publicly available, widely used, and showing appealing visualizations (Kaur et al., 2020).

However, recent research reported that explanations do not necessarily increase trust and reliance. Cheng et al. (2019) found that, even though explanations help users comprehend systems, they cannot increase human trust in using the systems in high-stakes applications involving lots of qualitative factors, such as graduate school admissions. Smith-Renner et al. (2020) reported that explanations of low-quality models decrease trust and system acceptance as they reveal model weaknesses to the users. According to Schramowski et al. (2020), despite correct predictions, the trust still drops if the users see from the explanations that the model relies on the wrong reasons. These studies go along with a perspective by Zhang et al. (2020b) that explanations should help calibrate user perceptions to the model quality, signaling whether the users should trust or distrust the AI.

Besides explanations, the effect of feedback on human trust is quite inconclusive according to some (but fewer) studies. On one hand, Smith-Renner et al.

Step 2 lets humans give feedback, so its efficiency concerns the amount of time they spend to understand the explanations and to produce the feedback.

We acknowledge that qualitatively analyzing explanations and feedback in languages at which one is not fluent is not easy, not to mention recruiting human subjects who know the languages. However, we hope that, with more multilingual data publicly available (Wolf et al., 2020) and growing awareness in the NLP community (Bender, 2019), there will be more EBHD studies targeting other languages in the near future.

Also, most existing EBHD works target text classifiers. It would be interesting to conduct more EBHD work for other NLP tasks such as reading comprehension, question answering, and natural language inference (NLI), to see whether existing techniques still work effectively. Shifting to other tasks requires an understanding of specific bug characteristics in those tasks. For instance, unlike bugs in text classification which are usually due to word artifacts, bugs in NLI concern syntactic heuristics between premises and hypotheses (Mc-Coy et al., 2019). Thus, giving human feedback at word level may not be helpful, and more advanced methods may be needed. Lakkaraju et al. (2020) remarked that the evaluation setup of existing EBHD work is often too easy or unrealistic.

Hence, it is not clear how powerful such EBHD frameworks are when dealing with real-world bugs.

(1) Directly adjust the model parameters (M). When the model is transparent and the explanation displays the model parameters in an intelligible way, humans can directly adjust the parameters based on their judgements. This idea was adopted by Kulesza et al. (2009Kulesza et al. ( , 2015 where humans can adjust a bar chart showing word importance scores, corresponding to the parameters of the underlying Naive Bayes model. In this special case, steps 2 and 3 in Figure 1 are combined into a single step. Besides, human feedback can be used to modify the model parameters indirectly. For example, Smith-Renner et al. (2020) increased a word weight in the Naive Bayes model by 20% for the class that the word supported, according to human feedback, and reduced the weight by 20% for the opposite class (binary classification). This choice gives good results, however, it is not clear why and whether 20% is the best choice here.

Overall, this approach is fast because it does not require model retraining. However, it is important to ensure that the adjustments made by humans generalize well to all examples. Therefore, the system should update the overall results (e.g., performance metrics, predictions, and explanations) in real time after applying any adjustment, so the humans can investigate the effects and further adjust the model parameters (or undo the adjustments) if necessary. This agrees with the correctability principles proposed by Kulesza et al. (2015) that the system should be actionable and reversible, honor user feedback, and show incremental changes.

(2) Improve the training data (D). We can use human feedback to improve the training data and retrain the model to fix bugs. This approach includes  Zylberajch et al., 2021). As this approach modifies the training data only, it is applicable to any model regardless of the model complexity.

(3) Influence the training process (T). Another approach is to influence the (re-)training process in a way that the resulting model will behave as the feedback suggests. This approach could be either model-specific (such as attention supervision) or model-agnostic (such as user co-training). Cho et al. (2019) used human feedback to supervise attention weights of the model. Similarly, Yao et al. (2021) added a loss term to regularize explanations guided by human feedback.  proposed (i) constraint optimization, translating human feedback into constraints governing the training process and (ii) user co-training, using feedback as another classifier working together with the main ML model in a semi-supervised learning setting.

With many techniques available, however, there has not been a study testing which technique is more appropriate for which task, domain, or model architecture.

Data augmentation (DA) encompasses methods of increasing training data diversity without directly collecting more data. Most strategies either add slightly modified copies of existing data or create synthetic data, aiming for the augmented data to act as a regularizer and reduce overfitting when training ML models (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019;Hernández-García and König, 2020). DA has been commonly used in CV, where techniques like cropping, flipping, and color jittering are a standard component of model training. In NLP, where the input space is discrete, how to generate effective augmented examples that capture the desired invariances is less obvious.

What are the goals and trade-offs? Despite challenges associated with text, many DA techniques for NLP have been proposed, ranging from rule-based manipulations (Zhang et al., 2015) to more complicated generative approaches (Liu et al., 2020b). As DA aims to provide an alternative to collecting more data, an ideal DA technique should be both easy-to-implement and improve model performance. Most offer trade-offs between these two.

Rule-based techniques are easy-to-implement but usually offer incremental performance improvements (Li et al., 2017;Wei and Zou, 2019;Wei et al., 2021b). Techniques leveraging trained models may be more costly to implement but introduce more data variation, leading to better performance boosts. Model-based techniques customized for downstream tasks can have strong effects on performance but be difficult to develop and utilize.

Further, the distribution of augmented data should neither be too similar nor too different from the original. This may lead to greater overfitting or poor performance through training on examples not representative of the given domain, respectively. Effective DA approaches should aim for a balance.

Kashefi and Hwa (2020) devise a KL-Divergence-based unsupervised procedure to preemptively choose among DA heuristics, rather than a typical ""run-all-heuristics"" comparison, which can be very time and cost intensive.

Interpretation of DA Dao et al. (2019) note that ""data augmentation is typically performed in an adhoc manner with little understanding of the underlying theoretical principles"", and claim the typical explanation of DA as regularization to be insufficient. Overall, there indeed appears to be a lack of research on why exactly DA works. Existing work on this topic is mainly surface-level, and rarely investigates the theoretical underpinnings and principles. We discuss this challenge more in §6, and highlight some of the existing work below. Bishop (1995) show training with noised examples is reducible to Tikhonov regularization (subsumes L2). Rajput et al. (2019) show that DA can increase the positive margin for classifiers, but only when augmenting exponentially many examples for common DA methods. Dao et al. (2019) think of DA transformations as kernels, and find two ways DA helps: averaging of features and variance regularization. Chen et al.

Automatic tools can take over some of the tasks that human moderators typically perform when monitoring online discussions. For example, in Social Sciences, one of the most discussed issues in crowd-scale deliberation is ""flaming"", i.e., aggressive and disrespectful communicative behavior (Lampe et al., 2014). Here, moderators could benefit from hate-speech and trolling detection methods in NLP. NLP methods to support deliberative decisionmaking have already been applied for the realtime visualisation of argument maps (El-Assady et al., 2017). Deliberation in real-time applications has the clear potential of structured arguments extraction from the news media (Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2020), the identification of the argumentative structure in deliberative contexts (Liebeck et al., 2016), as well as automatic argument summarization (Lawrence et al., 2017).

Beyond the real-time support to users (and moderators) provided by the methods described above, further tasks specific to AM which are part of the role of a human or (semi-)automoated moderator include: detecting fallacies (Habernal et al., 2018b), reasoning and common-sense (Habernal et al., 2018a), relevance estimation (Potthast et al., 2019). In addition, detecting and highlighting parts of an argument that are a good target for attacks (Jo et al., 2020a) can help the moderator to motivate more participation and argumentation from opposing sides of a discussion. Another important source is the detection of implicitly asserted prepositions (Jo et al., 2020b) which has a counterpart in the framing detection task (Card et al., 2015;Akyürek et al., 2020), as framing is a manipulation strategy which highlights specific aspects of an issue under discussion to promote certain interpretations.

Further NLP tasks which can play a crucial role in ensuring a healthy interaction are, for example, Hate Speech Detection (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012;Waseem and Hovy, 2016;Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017), Fact Checking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014;Kotonya and Toni, 2020), Facts recognition and source identification (Dusmanu et al., 2017).

How to represent discourse? Thus far, we have discussed the main ingredients of a rich NLP-informed approach to deliberative discourse. These components, together with the deliberationaugmented definition of AQ sketched in section 3 are the features that the NLP moderator takes as an input. One question remains open: How to represent the argumentative discourse within a contribution (e.g. a forum post) and across contributions (e.g. an entire online deliberation campaign)? We can approach also this question from an interdisciplinary perspective. Reference work in political science aims at modeling the mechanisms of political discourse in forms of discourse networks, as defined in Leifeld (2017). A discourse network is a bipartite graph, containing two classes of nodes: actors (e.g. Angela Merkel; the left-wing party; etc.) and claims (e.g. housing opportunities should be established for refugees); Edges between actors and claims indicate the support or opposition of a certain actor to a specific claim. Discourse coalitions (Hajer, 1993) and argumentative clusters are the projection of the affiliation network on the actor and claim sides of the network (Leifeld and Haunss, 2012;Haunss et al., 2013). Recent NLP research has targeted integration machine learning in the discourse network analysis workflow (Padó et al., 2019;Haunss et al., 2020). Crucially for AM, discourse networks can integrate claims and actors with a third class of nodes, the frame nodes, which encode the reason put forward by an actor to support or reject a claim. This type of representation is perfectly compatible with a graph-based approach on argument representation which has already been established as to be preferred to a tree-structure representation both empirically (Niculae et al., 2017) and theoretically (Afantenos and Asher, 2014).

Moderation can thus be modeled as optimization of specific quantitative properties of the discourse network: participant inclusion, can be enforced by ensuring that the contributions of peripheric actor nodes receive the deserved salience; argument mapping and summarization can be modeled by identifying ""hot"" sub-graphs in the network; the impact of a contribution (the grounded notion of AQ we have been advocating thus far) can be quantified as the perturbation introduced in the network, with its long term effects on convergence or polarization.

Who moderates the (NLP) moderators? The problem of biased moderation obviously relates to the issue of bias in NLP (Blodgett et al., 2020;Caliskan et al., 2017;Bolukbasi et al., 2016;Spliethöver and Wachsmuth, 2020) and it has a clear implication in the application of NLP methods to moderation. For example, we would not want our NLP models to infer a negative impact on AQ from cues which just reveal that the user belongs to certain groups. This is a real risk when quality is equated to ""success"", in turn quantified in terms of likes, replies, retweets. The public of a forum may be sensitive to such cues, but the moderator should be unbiased with respect to them. Another source of bias is the degree of literacy of a contribution: while users who express themselves poorly are likely to be less popular with the forum public, their contributions may still be a very good move in the ""cooperation challenge"" -one that moderators (NLP or humans, online or in-person) have to ensure will not be left unexploited.","[['b24', 'b17', 'b19', None], ['b37', 'b2', None, 'b11'], ['b53', 'b59', 'b15', None, 'b58', 'b39'], ['b31', 'b32', 'b4', 'b3', 'b21', None, 'b22', 'b1'], [], [None, 'b43']]","[['b24', 'b17', 'b19', None], ['b37', 'b2', None, 'b11'], ['b53', 'b59', 'b15', None, 'b58', 'b39'], ['b31', 'b32', 'b4', 'b3', 'b21', None, 'b22', 'b1'], [], [None, 'b43']]",24,"sent1: NLP-supported moderation represents a clear solution to the bottleneck problem affecting facilitation in digital democracy.

sent10: Further NLP tasks which can play a crucial role in ensuring a healthy interaction are, for example, Hate Speech Detection (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012;Waseem and Hovy, 2016;Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017), Fact Checking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014;Kotonya and Toni, 2020), Facts recognition and source identification (Dusmanu et al., 2017).How to represent discourse?
sent11: Thus far, we have discussed the main ingredients of a rich NLP-informed approach to deliberative discourse.
sent12: These components, together with the deliberationaugmented definition of AQ sketched in section 3 are the features that the NLP moderator takes as an input.
sent13: One question remains open: How to represent the argumentative discourse within a contribution (e.g. a forum post) and across contributions (e.g. an entire online deliberation campaign)?
sent14: We can approach also this question from an interdisciplinary perspective.
sent15: Reference work in political science aims at modeling the mechanisms of political discourse in forms of discourse networks, as defined in Leifeld (2017).
sent16: A discourse network is a bipartite graph, containing two classes of nodes: actors (e.g. Angela Merkel; the left-wing party; etc.) and claims (e.g. housing opportunities should be established for refugees); Edges between actors and claims indicate the support or opposition of a certain actor to a specific claim.
sent17: Discourse coalitions (Hajer, 1993) and argumentative clusters are the projection of the affiliation network on the actor and claim sides of the network (Leifeld and Haunss, 2012;Haunss et al., 2013).
sent18: Recent NLP research has targeted integration machine learning in the discourse network analysis workflow (Padó et al., 2019;Haunss et al., 2020).
sent19: Crucially for AM, discourse networks can integrate claims and actors with a third class of nodes, the frame nodes, which encode the reason put forward by an actor to support or reject a claim.
sent20: This type of representation is perfectly compatible with a graph-based approach on argument representation which has already been established as to be preferred to a tree-structure representation both empirically (Niculae et al., 2017) and theoretically (Afantenos and Asher, 2014).
sent21: Moderation can thus be modeled as optimization of specific quantitative properties of the discourse network: participant inclusion, can be enforced by ensuring that the contributions of peripheric actor nodes receive the deserved salience; argument mapping and summarization can be modeled by identifying ""hot"" sub-graphs in the network; the impact of a contribution (the grounded notion of AQ we have been advocating thus far) can be quantified as the perturbation introduced in the network, with its long term effects on convergence or polarization.
sent22: Who moderates the (NLP) moderators?
sent23: The problem of biased moderation obviously relates to the issue of bias in NLP (Blodgett et al., 2020;Caliskan et al., 2017;Bolukbasi et al., 2016;Spliethöver and Wachsmuth, 2020) and it has a clear implication in the application of NLP methods to moderation.
sent24: For example, we would not want our NLP models to infer a negative impact on AQ from cues which just reveal that the user belongs to certain groups.
sent25: This is a real risk when quality is equated to ""success"", in turn quantified in terms of likes, replies, retweets.
sent26: The public of a forum may be sensitive to such cues, but the moderator should be unbiased with respect to them.
sent27: Another source of bias is the degree of literacy of a contribution: while users who express themselves poorly are likely to be less popular with the forum public, their contributions may still be a very good move in the ""cooperation challenge"" -one that moderators (NLP or humans, online or in-person) have to ensure will not be left unexploited."

We propose to make a first step in tackling this challenge by mapping it into a concrete application: (semi-)automatic moderation implemented as a form of discourse optimization, or, as it is commonly referred to in the Social Sciences, facilitation (Kaner et al., 2007;Trénel, 2009). To illustrate the dynamics of moderation, let us start from concrete examples from a deliberation platform, RegulationRoom. This discussion forum has been employed by public institutions to gather citizens contributions on discussions targeting very heterogeneous issues (more details can be found in Appendix). Let us consider the following example from a discussion on the distracted driving by commercial vehicle operators (e.g., truckers and bus drivers). The posts we selected (arrows indicate comment nesting) are from the discussion sub-thread: Texting -what are the risks? 5 The example involves two users who clearly differ in their argumentation style and position. User 1 has a clear position on the topic (claim in bold: not just texting, but all cellphone interactions should be banned), which she/he supports with personal reports (underlined text) an emotional tone, and a style which is typical of social media text. User 2 replies, opening the post on a sarcastic note, which serves as the first premise to her/his (implicit) claim which is encoded in three rethorical questions (in bold): there should be no restrictions at all, because imposing them would be unfair. This is the case because (premises underlined): any distraction can cause an accident, some people are capable of using their phone while driving, people who spend lot of time in the car for professional reasons still need to communicate with loved ones. A moderator then joins the discussion to (a) provide a clarification as to why the focus is on texting and a link to further information on the matter, and (b) ask User 2 to elaborate on the personal communication issue, and to propose alternatives. In the Appendix we report another example from the same topic and thread, where the user acts as a problematizer, challenging the scope and definition of the rule under discussion and the moderator acts as a ""discourse traffic director"", pointing out that the user should read and contribute to different threads in the discussion.

The guidelines for human moderators in Reg-ulationRoom have been defined in advance in a 'moderator protocol' (eRulemaking Initiative et al., 2017) which reflect the moderator actions mentioned in the examples. In the protocol the moderator roles were divided into two main classes. Supervision functions include general moderator actions that do not necessarily target the specific content of the posts, e.g., greeting participants, monitoring compliance with netiquette (policing), or helping with technical difficulties. Substantive moderator functions aim to improve the quality of comments and promote fruitful discourse. As the examples above clearly show, this can both mean that the moderator encourages exchanges between discourse participants and participation in other posts (broadening the scope of the discussion), or helping users to improve the content of their posts (requests for clarification, focusing on one topic, substantive reasoning, sharing personal experiences).

RegulationRoom represents an excellent example of the beneficial role of the moderator in maintaining productive argumentation from participants. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little to no NLP work targeting moderation modeling. Park et al. (2012) used data from Regula-tionRoom and conducted an annotation study to empirically categorize the types of moderator interventions specified in the moderator protocol. Classification experiments were conducted using SVM to predict the type of action a moderator would perform, given the previous comment. However this work is limited as it only focuses on two types of moderator interventions (broadening the scope of the discussion, improving argument quality) and as it does not predict whether the moderator should intervene, building on the assumption that a given comment has already been flagged as ""in need for moderation"".

Besides the concrete example of Regulation-Room, moderation and discourse facilitation have been, and still are, a crucial topic in digital democracy. 6 The know-how of digital democracy experts is an invaluable starting point for the application of AM to moderation, as current research targets both the integration of digital solutions to facilitate online campaigns, and a critical reflection of the effects of such innovations on the deliberation outcomes.

Digital innovation supporting deliberation Argument maps (Walton, 2005) are widely employed to support online discussions, as an emerging optimization of the deliberation. Given a specific topic, for example possible reactions to climate change, users who wish to contribute to the discussion are requested to structure their contribution by producing an item in a conceptual map and optionally writing an accompanying post. Their contribution to the argument maps is often reviewed by a moderator. So in a sense, the argument map for a given deliberation process is the outcome of a process that comes both from below (the user) and above (the moderator).

Thanks to argument maps, the overall discourse picture can be overviewed and it is easier for the group of contributors to express support for one (or many) of the available options, without having to read a large number of long posts. An example of this approach is represented in Deliberatorium 7 , an e-deliberation platform which has been extensively employed in many reference studies on the effect of digital innovation on deliberation (Klein, 2011). Another example of a digital deliberation platform which integrates argument maps and offers an option for moderation is COLAGREE (Yang et al., 2021;Ito, 2018). Among the studies testing the impact of such digital platforms on online deliberation, Spada et al. (2015) tests the effect of Deliberatorium's argument maps on an online discussion among the supporters of the Italian Democratic party concerning the desired features of electoral law to be proposed by the party to the Parliament. This study compared the discussion of users employing Deliberatorium and a control group using a traditional forum format which was then encoded into argument maps. The comparison showed that the argument map modality did not discourage participation, and while it appeared to make users less creative (fewer new ideas as compared to the traditional forum), it also reduced the rate of claims without further discussion.

Yet, the need for trained moderators tends to be a significant bottleneck (both in terms of time and of costs) in digital deliberation. Moreover, empirical research on the effect of moderation on deliberation has uncovered the risks of biased moderation. For example, the experiment in Spada and Vreeland (2013) tests the extent to which moderators can influence participants' behavior by expressing their views during the moderation process.","[['b51', 'b12'], [], ['b34'], [None], ['b57'], ['b13', 'b8', 'b60', 'b41'], ['b42']]","[['b51', 'b12'], [], ['b34'], [None], ['b57'], ['b13', 'b8', 'b60', 'b41'], ['b42']]",10,"sent1: Grounding AQ in a discourse perspective which quantifies ""team-playing"" and its impact on discourse dynamics is a clear challenge, both theoretically, in the Social Sciences and Argumentation Theory, and concretely, as the empirical quantification of discourse-grounded AQ will require large annotation efforts, real-time implementations, and thorough evaluation strategies.

Social media plays an increasingly significant role in modern political and social discourse, yet resources built for conducting AM on this type of data structure remain limited for clear reasons. These platforms inherently collect and spread a wide range of content, including personal opinions, facts, fake news, and additional information of interest to users. Distinguishing between personal opinion, fact, and fake news, for example, is not always straightforward, as seen in recent work on fake news detection (Kotonya and Toni, 2020). Further, the language used on such platforms is infamously chaotic and often non-standard in comparison to the language use in more structured environments, like parliamentary debates. The combination of these aspects introduces the unique challenge of implementing AM to particularly heterogeneous, poorly annotated data.

Recent work has aimed to tackle such challenges in social media. Dusmanu et al. (2017) apply a supervised classification approach to identify arguments on Twitter, focusing on the tasks of facts recognition and source identification. They study the feasibility of the approaches proposed to address these tasks on a set of tweets related to the Grexit and Brexitnews topics. Habernal and Gurevych (2017) provide an extensive analysis of the steps and the modeling strategies necessary to analyze social media data (e.g. forum posts) in terms of their argumentative structure, while Simpson and Gurevych (2018) tackle the issue of the scalability of AM algorithms.

Despite the rising attention and developments to AM in social media, one of the major challenges currently facing the field is the lack of consensus on how exactly to analyse argumentative user-generated texts such as online comments (Bauwelinck and Lefever, 2020). On the one hand, the amount of annotations available for the scale of this heterogeneous data remains limited. Recent work by Schaefer and Stede (2020), among others, have aimed to construct large Twitter corpora annotated for argument components, including argumentative spans within tweets. On the other hand, annotation guidelines are not necessarily clear, and the theoretical motivations underlying the proposed guidelines used to generate labelled corpora rarely include motivation for the use of a particular theoretical basis. Bauwelinck and Lefever (2020) introduce a pilot study and aim to provide a clear justification of the theories and definitions underlying the design of a set of guidelines.

The linguistic, structural, and logistic complexity and ""openness"" of such platforms clearly present unique challenges. However, being able to work well with argumentative text from social media and discussion forums is essential considering the continuously growing impact on the political and social framework of modern times.

Multilingual argument mining Multilinguality is an important area of research in NLP that has gained more attention recently because of the crosslingual transfer potentials of Pre-trained Language Models (Devlin et al., 2019;Conneau et al., 2020) and because of the potentials for a societal impact at a global scale. The latter is particularly important when considering AM for Social Good since language should not be a barrier for participation if the goal is to allow any productive contribution.

Various recent studies have investigated multilinguality for AM. Eger et al. (2019) discuss a series of experiments on using machine translation and annotation projection for AM, specifically argument components extraction and classification in German, English, and Chinese. A similar approach to build training data in other languages using machine translation is done in Toledo-Ronen et al. (2020), which use a pre-trained multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for modeling. This approach is shown to perform well for classifying argument stance and detecting evidence, but not for predicting argument quality scores. Multilingual stance detection in political social media text (Vamvas and Sennrich, 2020) is also investigated in Lai et al. (2020) using stylistic, structural, affective and contextual features from text and analysing the scenarios in which each of these features is effective.

Other work has also dealt with building non-English datasets (Lindahl, 2020;Bauwelinck and Lefever, 2020;Schaefer and Stede, 2020;Zotova et al., 2020), but there still seems to be a focus on Indo-European languages (and sometimes Chinese) with a lack of datasets and analysis extending to other languages. This is a general issue in NLP research that extends to performance bias in favor of standard dialects for example in English (Blodgett et al., 2016) and bias that could target certain user groups instead of protecting them as was shown for Hate Speech Detection (Davidson et al., 2019).

236460206,Towards Argument Mining for Social Good: A Survey,"Computer Science, Linguistics, Political Science",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcb0b23685c9c116d8d53fe47e5157753659d3bd,s2,Framework,"Cabrio and Villata (2018) provide an elaborate overview of the AM framework in their data-driven analysis of the state of the art after five years of significant developments in the field of AM. Generally speaking, given a collection of natural language texts, the task at hand is implemented in two stages: Argument extraction The system first identifies the documents which contain the argumentative structure and the specific textual spans in which argumentation is encoded. Once the textual boundaries are defined, subportions of the argumentative spans are assigned to a set of pre-established argument components (e.g. claims, premises, rebuttal, etc.). A variety of models were used for this including Näive Bayes (Moens et al., 2007), SVMs (Mochales andMoens, 2011), RNNs (Niculae et al., 2017;Eger et al., 2017), Pre-trained Language Models (Chakrabarty et al., 2019;Lugini and Litman, 2020), and other supervised-learning techniques (Ein-Dor et al., 2020).

Relation assignment The goal of the second stage is to model the relations between the argumentative spans identified in the first stage. These relations can exist between different arguments (support, attack) as well as within an argument (connecting the premises with the claim). Recent approaches to argumentative relation classification investigate for example relational models (Trautmann et al., 2020) or inject background knowledge by leveraging features from different knowledge bases (Kobbe et al., 2019). Detecting these relations is necessary to model the overall structure of the argumentation (discourse/debate). As this structure can be complex, the task is difficult, involving high-level knowledge representation and reasoning issues. After the relations are detected, the discourse structure can then be mapped to a graph representation, called argumentation graph, with the arguments as nodes and relations as edges.

To simplify the problem, some approaches reduce the graph to a tree-structure representation (Peldszus and Stede, 2015;Stab and Gurevych, 2017). Different methods to generate the structure have been investigated, e.g. SVMs (Habernal and Gurevych, 2017;Niculae et al., 2017) or textual entailment (Cabrio and Villata, 2013;Cocarascu et al., 2020). Modeling the relations and argumentation flow within a debate is an important factor when defining the notion of argument quality, which will be presented in Section 3.

Consider the following example taken from an online debate about compulsory vaccinations 3 which demonstrates the framework quite clearly. Given a statement presenting background and context, participants are asked to discuss the question ""Does public health demand vaccinations?"" (Claims are in bold, and premises are underlined.) A1: A vaccine is the best way to prevent an outbreak of a disease or to reduce its negative effects. Vaccinated people become immune to a certain pathogen and do not develop a disease. Although there are occasionally side effects, these affect only a tiny number of people compared to the protection offered to the vast majority.

A2: Many vaccines have serious and sometimes deadly side effects. With many vaccines the immunity is not lifelong. Sometimes the vaccines itself can cause a serious disease to develop as a side effect. If governments know that compulsory mass vaccination is likely to cause death or permanent disability in even a few cases, it is immoral for them to make it compulsory.

Here, the argumentative text boundaries are first determined from the natural language discussion and the argument components (claims and premises) are extracted. Then, the relations between the two arguments are as follows: A 1 supports the argument while A 2 attacks it. However, consider another example, extracted from an online debate platform Kialo 4 . Here, the participants' contribution and the structure mirror a more direct and conversational dynamic to argumentation.

A1: Marvel Universe is better than DC Universe.

A2: Stan Lee's vision contains clarity and purpose, while DC is simply interested in churning entertainment to the masses.

A3: Stan Lee no-longer has control over any of marvel, which can cloud the purpose of Marvel due to it being owned by Disney.

A4: This is especially true due to his unfortunate passing.

A5: DC has been more apt to recycle parts of Intellectual Property, they even made an entire movie using the ideas of the 1960's characters and comics.

The seemingly simple example of an online exchange shows how a more conversational environment provides vaguer boundaries of argumentation structure and components. Each argument is more direct, not necessarily consisting of a claimpremise configuration, and the strength and productive quality of each argument is particularly relative to the context, each contribution affecting the argument differently either at a local or global level. Note, however, that the relations between arguments and claim are still relatively clear (e.g. A 2 supports while A 5 attacks the main claim in A 1 ; A 3 attacks A 2 directly; and A 4 closes any further 4 https://www.kialo.com/explore/ featured discussion on A 3 's premise).

Clearly, the environment and type of platform under consideration have a significant impact on a system's capacity to implement such a framework and on the degree of complexity found in the components and relations to extract, assign, and predict. Working in the realm of overtly argumentative text (such as persuasive essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2017)), while challenging of course, can be quite standardized. The language use is generally in line with natural language expectations and often standard (e.g. claim, premise and stance are clear), the structure and collective goal of the debate are rather controlled and topic-specific, and the collection of participants involved is often a closed or an easilyclassified set (e.g. in parliamentary debates, news forums, etc.).","[[None, 'b29', 'b26', 'b28'], ['b14', 'b49'], ['b31', None, 'b35', 'b44'], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ['b44']]","[[None, 'b29', 'b26', 'b28'], ['b14', 'b49'], ['b31', None, 'b35', 'b44'], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ['b44']]",11,"sent1: Cabrio and Villata (2018) provide an elaborate overview of the AM framework in their data-driven analysis of the state of the art after five years of significant developments in the field of AM.
sent2: Generally speaking, given a collection of natural language texts, the task at hand is implemented in two stages: Argument extraction The system first identifies the documents which contain the argumentative structure and the specific textual spans in which argumentation is encoded.
sent3: Once the textual boundaries are defined, subportions of the argumentative spans are assigned to a set of pre-established argument components (e.g. claims, premises, rebuttal, etc.).
sent4: A variety of models were used for this including Näive Bayes (Moens et al., 2007), SVMs (Mochales andMoens, 2011), RNNs (Niculae et al., 2017;Eger et al., 2017), Pre-trained Language Models (Chakrabarty et al., 2019;Lugini and Litman, 2020), and other supervised-learning techniques (Ein-Dor et al., 2020).Relation assignment
sent5: The goal of the second stage is to model the relations between the argumentative spans identified in the first stage.
sent6: These relations can exist between different arguments (support, attack) as well as within an argument (connecting the premises with the claim).
sent7: Recent approaches to argumentative relation classification investigate for example relational models (Trautmann et al., 2020) or inject background knowledge by leveraging features from different knowledge bases (Kobbe et al., 2019).
sent8: Detecting these relations is necessary to model the overall structure of the argumentation (discourse/debate).
sent9: As this structure can be complex, the task is difficult, involving high-level knowledge representation and reasoning issues.
sent10: After the relations are detected, the discourse structure can then be mapped to a graph representation, called argumentation graph, with the arguments as nodes and relations as edges.
sent11: To simplify the problem, some approaches reduce the graph to a tree-structure representation (Peldszus and Stede, 2015;Stab and Gurevych, 2017).
sent12: Different methods to generate the structure have been investigated, e.g. SVMs (Habernal and Gurevych, 2017;Niculae et al., 2017) or textual entailment (Cabrio and Villata, 2013;Cocarascu et al., 2020).
sent13: Modeling the relations and argumentation flow within a debate is an important factor when defining the notion of argument quality, which will be presented in Section 3.Consider the following example taken from an online debate about compulsory vaccinations 3 which demonstrates the framework quite clearly.
sent14: Given a statement presenting background and context, participants are asked to discuss the question ""Does public health demand vaccinations?""
sent15: (Claims are in bold, and premises are underlined.) A1: A vaccine is the best way to prevent an outbreak of a disease or to reduce its negative effects.
sent16: Vaccinated people become immune to a certain pathogen and do not develop a disease.
sent17: Although there are occasionally side effects, these affect only a tiny number of people compared to the protection offered to the vast majority.
sent18: A2: Many vaccines have serious and sometimes deadly side effects.
sent19: With many vaccines the immunity is not lifelong.
sent20: Sometimes the vaccines itself can cause a serious disease to develop as a side effect.
sent21: If governments know that compulsory mass vaccination is likely to cause death or permanent disability in even a few cases, it is immoral for them to make it compulsory.
sent22: Here, the argumentative text boundaries are first determined from the natural language discussion and the argument components (claims and premises) are extracted.
sent23: Then, the relations between the two arguments are as follows: A 1 supports the argument while A 2 attacks it.
sent24: However, consider another example, extracted from an online debate platform Kialo 4 .
sent25: Here, the participants' contribution and the structure mirror a more direct and conversational dynamic to argumentation.
sent26: A1: Marvel Universe is better than DC Universe.
sent27: A2: Stan Lee's vision contains clarity and purpose, while DC is simply interested in churning entertainment to the masses.
sent28: A3: Stan Lee no-longer has control over any of marvel, which can cloud the purpose of Marvel due to it being owned by Disney.
sent29: A4: This is especially true due to his unfortunate passing.
sent30: A5: DC has been more apt to recycle parts of Intellectual Property, they even made an entire movie using the ideas of the 1960's characters and comics.
sent31: The seemingly simple example of an online exchange shows how a more conversational environment provides vaguer boundaries of argumentation structure and components.
sent32: Each argument is more direct, not necessarily consisting of a claimpremise configuration, and the strength and productive quality of each argument is particularly relative to the context, each contribution affecting the argument differently either at a local or global level.
sent33: Note, however, that the relations between arguments and claim are still relatively clear (e.g. A 2 supports while A 5 attacks the main claim in A 1 ; A 3 attacks A 2 directly; and A 4 closes any further 4 https://www.kialo.com/explore/ featured discussion on A 3 's premise).
sent34: Clearly, the environment and type of platform under consideration have a significant impact on a system's capacity to implement such a framework and on the degree of complexity found in the components and relations to extract, assign, and predict.
sent35: Working in the realm of overtly argumentative text (such as persuasive essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2017)), while challenging of course, can be quite standardized.
sent36: The language use is generally in line with natural language expectations and often standard (e.g. claim, premise and stance are clear), the structure and collective goal of the debate are rather controlled and topic-specific, and the collection of participants involved is often a closed or an easilyclassified set (e.g. in parliamentary debates, news forums, etc.)."

Section 2.1); a complex task that aims to predict the relations holding between the arguments defined in the first stage. Being able to model the relations between arguments and components within the structure, for example in argument graphs (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016), allows us to actually work with the argumentative text in an applicationbased setting, understand the stance and context of arguments, and develop a story for the consequential impact of arguments on the discourse, among other things. Generally speaking, we can use this task as an approach to analyze argument quality (AQ). However, within the AM community, an open question concerns the adequate definition and operationalization of the notion of AQ. Despite this, to move forward with the task of AQ analysis and to create large corpora with crowd-sourced annotations, some approaches rely on the relative assessment of quality: Given two arguments, which is more convincing? (Habernal and Gurevych, 2016;Toledo et al., 2019;Gretz et al., 2020) Thus the natural way of quantifying the success of an argument is in terms of its persuasiveness. Indeed, plenty of previous work has explored the many factors which contribute to the persuasiveness of a message: the linguistic features employed by the authors (Persing and Ng, 2017), the semantic type of claims and premises (Hidey et al., 2017), the different sources of evidence produced to support an argument (Addawood and Bashir, 2016), the effects of the personality traits and prior beliefs on persuasiveness (Lukin et al., 2017;Durmus and Cardie, 2018;Al Khatib et al., 2020), the interaction with other participants (Ji et al., 2018;Egawa et al., 2020), the use of argument invention when debating about unknown topics (Bilu et al., 2019), the structure of the arguments (Li et al., 2020), and the effect of the style of the text in achieving persuasion (El Baff et al., 2020).

Persuasiveness is, however, not the only way to define whether an argument is good -at least not from a deliberation point of view. A good contribution to a debate is one which uncovers a previously unnoticed aspect of a problem, thus generating a perturbation in the discourse (controversies can be productive!). Or else, a good contribution is one that settles an issue, by stating the differences between opposing views and allowing the discourse to stabilize in a series of clusters (convergence on just one position is not necessarily a good outcome).

Most recent research projects (Wachsmuth et al., 2017b) aim to address the challenge of redefining the notion of AQ, away from persuasiveness and towards a more ""situated"" definition which has to do with the needs of argumentation in a real-world scenario. This new definition has been the basis for the creation of new corpora from different domains , where feature-based (Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020) and neural models were tested for automatic prediction . Other aspects of AQ have become the subject of AM research such as the relevance and impact of arguments (Durmus et al., 2019), the verifiability (Park and Cardie, 2018), local acceptability (Yang et al., 2019) and the best ""deliberative move"" (Al-Khatib et al., 2018).

We argue that this shift is necessary for two reasons: (1) Working with real-world applications of AM naturally forces us into the more heterogeneous realm of data structures, such as social media, in which language, structure, and content are less uniform and confined to the classic notion of logical debate; and (2) In order to encourage deliberation from an open audience of citizens, we need to redefine our concept of AQ and productive discourse such that there is equal worth and participation granted to each contributor of the argument.

Deliberative Quality We therefore propose adapting the definition of quality to integrate the abundant research on the topic from the field of Social Sciences. Here, the quality of a discourse has been investigated in the context of deliberation with the focus on inclusivity: how can the interplay of the different participants in the discourse lead to an optimal outcome for the collective? The focus here is not on the quality of the individual contributions. Instead, an overall quality of the discourse is determined by the fact that the individual quality dimensions are distributed among different contributions (e.g some participants do more rational reasoning, others share personal experiences). We would like to integrate those aspects that focus on inclusivity and cooperation.

Similar to Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), social scientists have developed a taxonomy, the discourse quality index (DQI), that describes the different desirable aspects of a discourse (Steenbergen et al., 2003). This taxonomy has been used to analyze the quality of deliberation in different contexts, ranging from more formal contexts, such as parliamentary debates (Steiner et al., 2005), to informal discussions in online forums (Trénel, 2004). Both implementations integrate logical coherence as one dimension, cogency in Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), justification in the DQI. Some aspects of inclusivity are also being touched upon in the rhetorical and dialectical dimension of Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), such as using appropriate language (Appropriateness) or whether an argument supports conflict resolution (global relevance). We concentrate on the following dimensions from the DQI, which particularly focus on the collaborative aspect of discourse.

• Respect: this dimension includes respectful tone, respect for other social groups/backgrounds, and openness towards other opinions.

• Equality / Participation: it is not desirable that some dominant participants make the bulk of contributions while many others remain passive. All participants should have equal opportunities to contribute and all topics, including those that DQI (Steenbergen et al., 2003)  • Interactivity: beyond simply sharing opinions, acknowledging other viewpoints and interacting with other participants through listening and responding lead to new perspectives arising -compromises can emerge.

• Testimoniality / Report of personal accounts:

sharing stories and personal narratives as an alternative form of communication can involve more people in the discourse, especially those who cannot identify themselves with rational argumentation. It can also make other participants aware of other perspectives as it generally increases empathy. Especially when traditional or universal norms need to be questioned, narratives are particularly well suited, as their ambiguity and vagueness creates room for interpretation. This is particularly important when new ideas or perspectives are introduced, since they cannot yet be rationally articulated. Table 1 establishes a direct comparison between discourse quality dimensions of the DQI (Steenbergen et al., 2003;Steiner et al., 2005) and argument quality dimensions as defined in Wachsmuth et al. (2017b). Apart from the potential theoretical insights, the existing guidelines can be applied to annotate new or enrich existing corpora for AM. Despite the small size, the data already annotated based on the DQI can be made usable and extended for NLP. In addition, some of the quality dimensions can be further quantified or approximated using statistical methods. For example, interactivity or equality can be assessed with frequency-based methods, such as frequency of posts by distinct participants and response rate.

Summing up The overview of the definitions of AQ along with the discussion of the potential of the integration of Deliberative Quality features into an AM framework has one strong take-home message:

The need for the scope of the investigation to go beyond (a) the persuasiveness of a an argumentative text (speeches, forum posts, tweets), and (b) their relation to the immediate preceding discourse. Instead, we pointed out the need to also assess the potential of the impact of that argumentative text on the upcoming discourse: this dimension of quality, inherently related to the interpretation of argumentation as a cooperation challenge, is currently lacking in current approaches to AQ.","[['b36', 'b23', 'b27', 'b9', None, 'b6', 'b47'], [], ['b61', 'b56', 'b55', None, 'b33'], [], [], ['b45', 'b55', 'b46', 'b50'], [], ['b45'], [], ['b45', 'b46', 'b55'], [], []]","[['b36', 'b23', 'b27', 'b9', None, 'b6', 'b47'], [], ['b61', 'b56', 'b55', None, 'b33'], [], [], ['b45', 'b55', 'b46', 'b50'], [], ['b45'], [], ['b45', 'b46', 'b55'], [], []]",20,"sent1: The second stage in the framework of AM is defined as relation assignment (c.f.

Some acquire their languages simultaneously from birth, while others acquire them sequentially, either naturally or via explicit instruction. Multilingualism is the norm in many zones where local residents may speak different languages to accommodate their interlocutors. Speakers who use local dialects or minoritized varieties may also be engaged in C-S when switching between their variety and a dominant one (Mills and Washington, 2015;Blom and Gumperz, 1972). C-S in bilingual language acquisition of children has been studied across language contact contexts in Europe. In Germany, Herkenrath (2012) and Pfaff (1999) focused on Turkish-German C-S and Meisel (1994) on German-French C-S of bilingual children. From a comparative perspective, Poeste et al. (2019) analyzed C-S among bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual children growing up in Spain and Germany. In the Netherlands, Bosma and Blom (2019) focused on C-S among bilingual Frisian-Dutch children. In addition to analyzing C-S in children's speech, Juan-Garau and Perez-Vidal (2001) and Lanza (1998) investigated C-S in the interaction patterns between bilingual children and their parents (i.e. Spanish-Catalan and English-Norwegian respectively).

Within an educational setting, Kleeman (2012) observed C-S among bilingual (North Sami-Norwegian) kindergarten children in the North of Norway. Similarly, Jørgensen (1998) and Cromdal (2004) report the use of C-S for resolving disputes among bilingual (Turkish-Danish) children in Denmark and multilingual (Swedish-English and/or a Non-Scandinavian Language) children in Sweden respectively.

C-S does not only take place between standard languages but between minority languages and dialects as well. For example, Themistocleous (2013) studied C-S between Greek and Cypriot Greek and Deuchar (2006) focused on the C-S between Welsh and English in the UK. Berruto (2005) reports cases of language mixing between standard Italian and Italoromance dialects in Italy. In the Balkans, Kyuchukov (2006) analyzed C-S between Turkish-Bulgarian and Romani in Bulgaria. C-S between dialects and/or standard vs. minority languages in computer mediated interaction was analyzed by Siebenhaar (2006) among Swiss-German dialects and by Robert-Tissot and Morel (2017) through SMS corpora collected across Germanic (i.e. English and German) and Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian) in Switzerland.

C-S is commonly observable across immigrant contexts in Europe. In the UK, Georgakopoulou and Finnis (2009) described the C-S patterns between English and Cypriot Greek while Issa (2006) focused on the C-S between English and Cypriot Turkish communities in London. Wei and Milroy (1995) analyzed the C-S between English and Chinese from a conversational analysis point of view based on the interactions of bilingual (Chinese-English) families in Northeastern England. In addition, Ożańska-Ponikwia (2016) investigated the Polish-English C-S in the UK as well. C-S among immigrant community members have also been widely studied in Germany (e.g. Turkish-German C-S by Keim (2008) and Ç etinoglu (2017), Russian-German C-S by Khakimov (2016)). In the Netherlands, C-S studies include Turkish-Dutch C-S by Backus (2010) and Dutch-Morroccan C-S by Nortier (1990). In Belgium, Meeuws and Blommaert (1998) studied the French-Lingala-Swahili C-S among immigrants of Zaire and Treffers-Daller (1994) studied French-Dutch C-S in Brussels. In Spain, Jieanu (2013) describes the Romanian-Spanish C-S among the Romanian immigrants. In addition to the C-S analyses within spoken interactions of immigrant communities across Europe, there are also studies about C-S within computer mediated communication as well. These studies include Greek-German C-S by Androutsopoulos (2015) in Germany, Turkish-Dutch C-S by Papalexakis et al. (2014), Papalexakis and Dogruöz (2015) and a comparison of Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch C-S by Dorleijn and Nortier (2009) in the Netherlands. Similarly, Marley (2011) compared French-Arabic C-S within computer mediated interaction across Moroccan communities in France and the UK.

In addition to daily communication, some linguists are also interested in the C-S observed in historical documents. While Swain (2002) explored Latin-Greek C-S by Cicero (Roman Statesman), Dunkel (2000) analyzed C-S in his communication with Atticus (Roman philosopher who studied in Athens) in the Roman Empire. Argenter (2001) reports cases of language mixing within the Catalan Jewish community (in Spain) in the 14th and 15th centuries and Rothman (2011) highlights the C-S between Italian, Slavic and Turkish in the historical documents about Ottoman-Venetian relations. In Switzerland, Volk and Clematide (2014) worked on detecting and annotating C-S patterns in diachronic and multilingual (English, French, German, Italian, Romansh and Swiss German) Alpine Heritage corpus.

Within the media context, Martin (1998) investigated English C-S in written French advertising, and Onysko (2007) investigated the English C-S in German written media through corpus analyses. Zhiganova (2016) indicates that German speakers perceive C-S into English for advertising purposes with both positive and negative consequences.

Similar to humans, institutions and/or organizations could also have multilingual communication with their members and/or audience. For example, Wodak et al. (2012) analyzed the C-S and language choice at the institutional level for European Union institutions.","[['b17', 'b56', 'b29', 'b11', None, 'b40', 'b39', 'b54'], [], ['b75', 'b28', 'b69'], ['b51', 'b46', 'b80', 'b23', 'b52', 'b38', 'b24', None, 'b12', 'b1'], [], ['b35', 'b83'], ['b81']]","[['b17', 'b56', 'b29', 'b11', None, 'b40', 'b39', 'b54'], [], ['b75', 'b28', 'b69'], ['b51', 'b46', 'b80', 'b23', 'b52', 'b38', 'b24', None, 'b12', 'b1'], [], ['b35', 'b83'], ['b81']]",24,"sent1: The contexts in which people acquire and use multiple languages in Europe are diverse.
sent2: Some acquire their languages simultaneously from birth, while others acquire them sequentially, either naturally or via explicit instruction.
sent3: Multilingualism is the norm in many zones where local residents may speak different languages to accommodate their interlocutors.
sent4: Speakers who use local dialects or minoritized varieties may also be engaged in C-S when switching between their variety and a dominant one (Mills and Washington, 2015;Blom and Gumperz, 1972).

sent8: In addition to analyzing C-S in children's speech, Juan-Garau and Perez-Vidal (2001) and Lanza (1998) investigated C-S in the interaction patterns between bilingual children and their parents (i.e. Spanish-Catalan and English-Norwegian respectively).
sent9: Within an educational setting, Kleeman (2012) observed C-S among bilingual (North Sami-Norwegian) kindergarten children in the North of Norway.

There are 121 major languages and 1599 other languages in India, out of which 22 (Assamese, Bangla, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Urdu) are scheduled languages with an official recognition (almost 97% of the population speaks one of the scheduled languages). Most of the population ( 93%) speak languages from the Indo-Aryan (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Assamese, Maithili, Odia) and Dravidian (Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil) language families. The census excludes languages with a population lower than 10,000 speakers. Given this, it is probably difficult to find monolingual speakers in India considering the linguistic diversity and wide-spread multilingualism. Kachru (1978) provides one of the early studies on the types and functions of C-S in India with a historical understanding of the multilingual context.

In addition to the mutual influences and convergence of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages internally, he mentions Persian and English as outside influences on Indian languages. Similarly, Sridhar (1978) provides an excellent comparative overview about the functions of C-S in Kannada in relation to the Perso-Arabic vs. English influences. Kumar (1986) gives examples about the formal (e.g. within NPs, PPs, VPs) and functional (i.e. social and stylistic) aspects of Hindi-English C-S from a theoretical point of view. More recently, Doley (2013) explains how fish mongers in a local fish market in Assam adjust and switch between Assamese, English and local languages strategically to sell their products to multilingual clientele. Another observation about C-S in daily life comes from Boro (2020) who provides examples of English, Assamese and Bodo (another language spoken in the Assam region) C-S and borrowings. In addition to English, Portuguese was also in contact with the local languages as a result colonization in South India. For example, Kapp (1997) explains the Portuguese influence through borrowings in Dravidian languages (i.e. Kannada and Telugu) spoken in India.

Instead of automatic data collection and methods of analyses, the C-S examples for the abovementioned studies are (probably) encountered and collected by the authors themselves in daily life interactions over a period of time with limited means. Nowadays, these small sets of data would be regarded as insignificant in computational areas of research. However, ignoring these studies and data could have serious consequences since crucial information about the social and cultural dynamics in a multilingual setting would also be lost. For example, Nadkarni (1975) proves this point by explaining how social factors influence the C-S between Saraswat Brahmin dialect of Konkani (Indo-Aryan language) and Kannada (Dravidian language) in the South of India. Both languages have been in contact with each other for over four hundred years. Saraswat Brahmins are fluent in both Konkani and Kannada but they do not speak Konkani with Kannada speakers and they also do not C-S between Konkani and Kannada. Nadkarni (1975) attributes this preference to the high prestige associated with Konkani within the given social context. Since Kannada (perceived as less prestigious) is widely spoken in that region, Konkani speakers learn and speak Kannada for functional purposes in daily life which does not involve C-S. However, it is not common for Kannada speakers to learn and speak Konkani (Nadkarni, 1975).

C-S in India has been investigated through written media, advertising and film industry as well. Si (2011) analyzed Hindi-English C-S in the scripts of seven Bollywood movies which were filmed between 1982 and 2004. Her results indicate a change of direction C-S over the years. More specifically, Hindi was the dominant language with occasional switches to English for the early productions but English became the dominant language especially for younger generations in the later productions. A similar trend has been observed for Bengali movie scripts as well. Through analyzing movie scripts (between 1970s and 2010s), Chatterjee (2016) finds a drastic increase in the use of bilingual verbs (e.g. renovate koreche ""renovation do"") over time and attributes this rise to the increasing popularity of English in Indian society. Within the immigrant context, Gardner-Chloros and Charles (2007) focused on the types and functions of C-S between Hindi and English across the TV programs (e.g. highly scripted vs. loosely scripted programs) of a British/Asian cable channel in the UK. Although they have come across C-S in a variety of TV shows, the least amount of C-S was encountered in the news broadcasts (i.e. highly scripted). In general, they have encountered less C-S on TV broadcasts in comparison to the natural speech and attribute this factor to the consciousness of TV personalities about pure language use (instead of C-S). Similarly, Zipp (2017) analyzed Gujarati-English C-S within a radio show targeting British South Asians living in the US and concluded that C-S was part of identity construction among youngsters (group identity). Pratapa and Choudhury (2017) perform a quantitative study of 18 recent Bollywood (Hindi) movies and find that C-S is used for establishing identity, social dynamics between characters and the socio-cultural context of the movie.

From an advertising point of view, Kathpalia and Wee Ong (2015) analyzed C-S in Hinglish (i.e. Hindi, English, Urdu, Sanskrit according to their definition) billboards about the Amul brand in India. After compiling the advertisements on billboards (1191), they classified the structures and functions of C-S. Their results indicate more intrasentential C-S than intersentential ones on the billboards. In terms of function, the advertisers used C-S to indicate figures of speech (e.g. puns, associations, contradictory associations, word-creation and repetitions) to attract the attention of the target group. Mohanty (2006) provides an extended overview of the multilingual education system in India exploring the types and quality of schools across a wide spectrum. In general, high-cost English Medium (EM) education is valued by upper-class and affluent families. Although low-cost EM education is also available for lower income families, he questions its impact in comparison to education in the local languages. Sridhar (2002) explains that C-S is commonly practiced among students in schools across India. In addition, she finds it unrealistic to ask the students to separate the two languages harshly. In immigrant contexts, Martin et al. (2006) investigates how Gujarati-English C-S is used among the South Asian students in educational settings in the UK. Another analysis reveals a shift from Bengali toward English among the younger generations of the immigrant Bengali community in the UK (Al-Azami, 2006). In terms of the C-S patterns, first generation immigrants integrate English words while speaking Bengali whereas English dominates the conversations of younger generations with occasional switches to Bengali. There are also studies about Bengali-English C-S in the UK school settings (Pagett, 2006) and Bangladesh (Obaidullah, 2016) as well. However, a systematic comparison between Bengali-English C-S in India, Bangladesh and immigrant settings are lacking.

In their study about aphasic patients, Shyamala Chengappa and Bhat (2004) report increased frequency of C-S between Malayalam and English for aphasic patients in comparison to the control group. However, there were less differences between the groups in terms of functions of C-S. Deepa and Shyamala (2019) find that amount and types of C-S could be used to differentiate between healthy and mild dementia patients who are bilingual in Kannada and English. Although both studies are carried out with limited subjects, they offer insights about the use of C-S in health settings as well.","[[None, 'b19'], ['b73', 'b27'], [None], ['b84', 'b67'], ['b72', 'b36', 'b41', 'b50', None], []]","[[None, 'b19'], ['b73', 'b27'], [None], ['b84', 'b67'], ['b72', 'b36', 'b41', 'b50', None], []]",12,"sent1: According to the 2011 Census (Chandramouli, 2011), 26% of the population of India is bilingual, while 7% is trilingual.

For example, there is no widely-used spoken dialogue system that can understand as well as produce code-switched speech, although some voice assistants may recognize and produce C-S in limited scenarios in some locales. Although computational implementations of grammatical models of C-S exist (Bhat et al., 2016), they do not necessarily generate natural C-S utterances that a bilingual speaker would produce (Pratapa et al., 2018). Most crucially, current computational approaches to C-S language technologies do not usually take into account the linguistic and social factors that influence why and when speakers/users choose to code-switch.

Bawa et al. (2020) conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study using a Hindi-English chatbot and found that not only did bilingual users prefer chatbots that could code-switch, they also showed a preference towards bots that mimicked their own C-S patterns. Rudra et al. (2016) report a study on 430k tweets from Hindi-English bilingual users and find that Hindi is preferred for the expression of negative sentiment. In a follow-up study, Agarwal et al. (2017) find that Hindi is the preferred language for swearing in Hindi-English C-S tweets, and swearing may be a motivating factor for users to switch to Hindi. The study also finds a gender difference, with women preferring to swear in English more often than Hindi. Such studies indicate that multilingual chatbots and intelligent agents need to be able to adapt to users' linguistic styles, while also being capable of determining when and how to code-switch.

Due to the paucity of user-facing systems and standard benchmarks covering only a handful of simpler NLP tasks, it is likely that we overestimate how well computational models are able to handle C-S. In sum, language technologies for C-S seem to be constrained by the lack of availability of diverse C-S training data, evaluation benchmarks and the absence of user-facing applications.

The use of a single Spanish word in an English tweet (ex. 2) is not as syntactically complicated as the integration in ex. 1. In fact, it may not signal multilingualism at all, simply borrowing. Many words, particularly anglicisms, circulate globally: marketing, feedback, gay.

But, to produce example (1), the speaker has to know what word order and case marker to use, and which languages they should be drawn from. NLP scholars are not always concerned with the difference between examples (1) and (2) so that, with some exceptions (Bhat et al., 2016), grammatical work in NLP tends to rely heavily on the notion of a matrix language model advanced by Joshi (1982) and later adapted by Myers-Scotton (1997) as the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) model. The MLF holds that one language provides the grammatical frame into which words or phrases from another are embedded and its scope of application is a clause. Thus, it would not apply to the alternational English-Afrikaans C-S in example (3) as each clause is in a separate language (Dulm, 2007).

3. I love Horlicks maar hierś niks 'I love Horlicks but there's nothing there '

Although it dominates computational approaches to C-S, the MLF is contested on empirical and theoretical grounds. The consistent identification of a matrix language is not always possible, the criteria for defining it are ambiguous, and its scope is limited (Meakins, 2012;Bhat et al., 2016;Adamou, 2016;MacSwan, 2000;Auer and Muhamedova, 2005). Bullock et al. (2018) computationally show that different ways of determining the matrix language only reliably converge over sentences with simple insertions as in example (2).

For many linguists, the MLF is not the only way, or even an adequate way, to theorize C-S. The Equivalence Constraint (Poplack, 1980) captures the fact that C-S tends to occur at points where the linear structures of the contributing languages coincide, as when the languages involved share word order. Other syntactic theories are built on the differences between lexical and functional elements, including the Government Constraint (DiSciullo et al., 1986) and the Functional Head Constraint (Belazi et al., 1994). Incorporating the latter in NLP experiments has been shown to improve the accuracy of computational and speech models (Li and Fung, 2014;Bhat et al., 2016). Functional elements include negative particles and auxiliaries, which are respectively classified as Adverbs and Verbs (lexical classes), in some NLP tag sets (Al-Ghamdi et al., 2016). This means that NLP experiments often use annotations that are too coarse to be linguistically informative with regard to C-S. Constraint-free theories (Mahootian and Santorini, 1996;MacSwan, 2000) hold that nothing restricts switching apart from the grammatical requirements of the contributing languages. Testing such theories in NLP experiments would require syntactically parsed corpora that are rare for mixed language data (Partanen et al., 2018). In sum, working together, theoretical and computational linguists could create better tools for processing C-S than those currently available.

3 Why do speakers code-switch?

In addition to focusing on the linguistic aspects and constraints on C-S, linguists are also interested in the social and cognitive motivations for switching across languages. What a (multilingual) speaker is trying to achieve by switching languages can affect its structural outcome. Linguists recognize that pragmatic, interactional, and socio-indexical functions may condition C-S patterns. For instance, Myslín and Levy (2015) demonstrate that Czech-English speakers switch to English for highinformation content words in prominent prosodic positions when speaking Czech. Other uses of C-S with structural traces include signalling an in-group identity through backflagging (Muysken, 1995) or emblematic tag-switching (Poplack, 1980). These are words or phrases that are used at the edge of clauses (e.g., Spanish ojalá or English so). Other functions, among these, quoting a speaker, getting the attention of an interlocutor, or reiterating an utterance to soften or intensify a message will also be indicated via C-S in predictable linguistic constructions, such as with verbs of 'saying', vocative expressions, and sequential translation equivalents (Gumperz, 1982;Zentella, 1997).

According to Clyne (1991), there are eight factors (e.g. topic, type of interaction, interlocutors, role relationship, communication channel) that can influence C-S choices. Lavric (2007) explains C-S choices in line with politeness theory, focusing on prestige and face-saving moves in multilingual conversations. Heller (1992) takes a macro-social view, arguing that French-English C-S in Quebec may signal a political choice among both dominant and subordinate groups. Gardner-Chloros and Edwards (2004) suggest that social factors influence language choice, with different generations of speakers from the same community exhibiting very different C-S patterns. Similarly Sebba (1998) argues that as speakers cognitively construct equivalence between morphemes, words, and phrases across their languages, communities of the same languages may do this differently. Evidence from computational studies suggests that C-S is speaker-dependent (Vu et al., 2013). Gender and identity also play a role for C-S practices in English and Greek Cypriot community in London (Finnis, 2014). From a computational perspective, Papalexakis et al. (2014) investigated the factors that influence C-S choices (Turkish-Dutch) in computer mediated interaction and how to predict them 1656 automatically.","[[], ['b3', None, 'b16', 'b43', 'b71'], [], ['b37', None, 'b32'], ['b31', 'b32', 'b53', None, 'b57', 'b33'], [], ['b9', 'b57', 'b42', 'b82', 'b44'], ['b10', 'b30', 'b7', 'b5', 'b52', None, 'b65', 'b79']]","[[], ['b3', None, 'b16', 'b43', 'b71'], [], ['b37', None, 'b32'], ['b31', 'b32', 'b53', None, 'b57', 'b33'], [], ['b9', 'b57', 'b42', 'b82', 'b44'], ['b10', 'b30', 'b7', 'b5', 'b52', None, 'b65', 'b79']]",27,"sent1: For linguists, the specific ways in which languages are switched matters.

This is closely connected to the human-prior-based identification approaches in Section 4.1 as those human-priors can often be used to re-formulate the training objective with additional regularizers. To achieve this goal, one usually needs to first construct a side component to inform the main model about the misaligned features, and then to regularize the main model according to the side component. The construction of this side component usually relies on prior knowledge of what the misaligned features are. Then, methods can be built accordingly to counter the features such as label-associated keywords (He et al., 2019), label-associated text fragments (Mahabadi et al., 2020), and general easy-to-learn patterns of data (Nam et al., 2020). Similarly, Clark et al. (2019Utama et al. (2020a,b) propose to ensemble with a model explicitly capturing bias, where the main model is trained together with this ""bias-only"" model such that the main model is discouraged from using biases. More recent work (Xiong et al., 2021) shows the ensemble-based approaches can be further improved via better calibrating the bias-only model. Furthermore, additional regularizers have been introduced for robust fine-tuning over pre-trained models, e.g., mutual-information-based regularizers (Wang et al., 2021a) and smoothness-inducing adversarial regularization (Jiang et al., 2020).

In a broader scope, given that one of the main challenges of domain adaptation is to counter the model's tendency in learning domain-specific spurious features (Ganin et al., 2016), some methods contributing to domain adaption may have also progressed along the line of our interest, e.g., domain adversarial neural network (Ganin et al., 2016). This line of work also inspires a family of methods forcing the model to learn auxiliary-annotationinvariant representations with a side component (Ghifary et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2017;Rozantsev et al., 2018;Motiian et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018;Vernikos et al., 2020).

Despite the diverse concrete ideas introduced, the above is mainly training for small empirical loss across different domains or distributions in addition to forcing the model to be invariant to domain-specific spurious features. As an extension along this direction, invariant risk minimization (IRM) (Arjovsky et al., 2019) introduces the idea of invariant predictors across multiple environments, which was later followed and discussed by a variety of extensions (Choe et al., 2020;Ahmed et al., 2020;Rosenfeld et al., 2021).

Natural Language Inference Naik et al. (2018) sampled misclassified examples and analyzed their potential sources of errors, which are then grouped into a typology of common reasons for error. Such error types then served as the bases to construct the stress test set, to further evaluate whether NLI models have the ability to make real inferential decisions, or simply rely on sophisticated pattern matching.

(2018)     showed another approach by limiting the input space of the characters so that the models will be likely to perceive data typos and misspellings.

Syntactic and Semantic Parsing Robust parsing has been studied in several existing works (Lee et al., 1995;Aït-Mokhtar et al., 2002). More recent work showed that neural semantic parsers are still not robust against lexical and stylistic variations, or meaning-preserving perturbations (Marzinotto et al., 2019;Huang et al., 2021), and proposed ways to improve their robustness through data augmentation (Huang et al., 2021) and adversarial learning (Marzinotto et al., 2019).

Text Generation Existing work found that text generation models also suffer from robustness issues, e.g., text summarization models suffer from positional bias (Jung et al., 2019), layout bias (Kryscinski et al., 2019), and a lack of faithfulness and factuality (Kryscinski et al., 2019;Maynez et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2021b); data-to-text models sometimes hallucinate texts that are not supported by the data (Parikh et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020d).

This particularly posed a challenge towards the adversarial attack and defense regime when the study in vision is transferred to NLP (Lei et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2020c), in the sense that simple gradient-based adversarial attacks will not directly translate to meaningful attacks in the discrete text space, and multiple novel attack methods are proposed to fill the gap, as we will discuss in later sections.

Perceptible to Human vs. Not On a related topic, one of the most impressive property of ad-versarial attack in vision is that small perturbation of the image data imperceptible to human are sufficient to deceive the model (Szegedy et al., 2013), while this can hardly be true for NLP attacks. Instead of being imperceptible, the adversarial attacks in NLP typically are bounded by the fact that the meaning of the sentences are not altered (despite being perceptible).

In vision study, although the images from training distribution and test distribution can be sufficiently different, the train and test distributions mostly share the same support (the pixels are always sampled from a 0-255 integer space), although the density of these distributions can be very different (e.g., photos vs. sketches). On the other hand, domain adaptation of NLP sometimes studies the regime where the supports of the data differ, e.g., the vocabularies can be significantly different in cross-lingual studies (Abad et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020a).

Existing work has shown a model's performance might degrade substantially in both cases, but the transferability of the two categories is relatively underexplored. In the vision domain, Taori et al. (2020) investigate models' robustness to natural distribution shift, and show that robustness to synthetic distribution shift might offer little to no robustness improvement under natural distribution shift. Some studies show NLP models might not generalize to unseen adversarial patterns (Huang et al., 2020;Jha et al., 2020;Joshi and He, 2021), but more work is needed to systematically bridge the gap between NLP models' robustness under natural and synthetic distribution shifts.

To better understand why models exhibit a lack of robustness, some existing work attributed this to the fact that models sometimes utilize spurious correlations between input features and labels, rather than the genuine ones, where spurious features are commonly defined as features that do not causally affect a task's label (Srivastava et al., 2020;Wang and Culotta, 2020b): they correlate with task labels but fail to transfer to more challenging test conditions or out-of-distribution data (Geirhos et al., 2020). Some other work defined it as ""prediction rules that work for the majority examples but do not hold in general"" (Tu et al., 2020). Such spurious correlations are sometimes referred as dataset bias (Clark et al., 2019;He et al., 2019), annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al., 2018), or group shift (Oren et al., 2019) in the literature. Further, evidence showed that controlling model's learning in spurious features will improve model's performances in distribution shifts (Wang et al., 2019a,b); also, discussions on the connections between adversarial robustness and learning of spurious features have been raised (Ilyas et al., 2019;. Theoretical discussions connecting these fields have also been offered by crediting a reason of model's lack of robustness in either distribution shift or adversarial attack to model's learning of spurious features (Wang et al., 2021c).

Further, in certain applications, model ""robustness"" can also be connected with models' instability (Milani Fard et al., 2016), or models having poorly-calibrated uncertainty estimation (Guo et al., 2017), where Bayesian methods (Graves, 2011;Blundell et al., 2015), dropout-based (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016;Kingma et al., 2015) and ensemble-based approaches (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) have been proposed to improve models' uncertainty estimation. Recently, Ovadia et al. (2019) have shown models' uncertainty estimation can degrade significantly under distributional shift, and call for more work to ensure a model ""knows when it doesn't know"" by giving lower uncertainty estimates over out-of-distribution data.

This topic has been widely explored in computer vision under the concept of adversarial robustness, which measures models' performances against carefully crafted noises generated deliberately to deceive the model to predict wrongly, pioneered by (Szegedy et al., 2013;Goodfellow et al., 2015), and later extended to NLP, such as (Ebrahimi et al., 2018;Alzantot et al., 2018;Li et al., 2019;Feng et al., 2018;Kuleshov et al., 2018;Jia et al., 2019;Zang et al., 2020;Pruthi et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019e;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020;Tan et al., 2020a,b;Schwinn et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021;Boucher et al., 2022) and multilingual adversaries . The generation of adversarial examples primarily builds upon the observation that we can generate samples that are meaningful to humans (e.g., by perturbing the samples with changes that are imperceptible to humans) while altering the prediction of the models for this sample. In this regard, human's remarkable ability in understanding a large set of synonyms (Li et al., 2020) or interesting characteristics in ignoring the exact order of letters  are often opportunities to create adversarial examples. A related line of work such as data-poisoning (Wallace et al., 2021) and weight-poisoning (Kurita et al., 2020) exposes NLP models' vulnerability against attacks during the training process. One can refer to more comprehensive reviews and broader discussions on this topic in Zhang et al. (2020c) and Morris et al. (2020b). Assumptions around Label-preserving and Semantic-preserving Most existing work in vision makes a relatively simplified assumption that the gold label of x remains unchanged under a bounded perturbation over x, i.e., y = y, and a model's robust behaviour should be f (x ) = y (Szegedy et al., 2013;Goodfellow et al., 2015). A similar line of work in NLP follows the same label-preserving assumption with small text perturbations like token and character swapping (Alzantot et al., 2018;Jin et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2019;Ebrahimi et al., 2018), paraphrasing (Iyyer et al., 2018;Gan and Ng, 2019), semantically equivalent adversarial rules (Ribeiro et al., 2018), and adding distractors (Jia and Liang, 2017). However, this label-preserving assumption might not always hold, e.g., Wang et al. (2021b) studied several existing text perturbation techniques and found that a significant portion of perturbed examples are not label-preserving (despite their label-preserving assumptions), or the resulting labels have a high disagreement among human raters (i.e., can even fool humans). Morris et al. (2020a) also call for more attention to the validity of perturbed examples for a more accurate robustness evaluation.

Another line of work aims to perturb the input x to x in small but meaningful ways that explicitly change the gold label, i.e., y = y, under which case the robust behaviour of a model should be f (x ) = y and f (x ) = y (Gardner et al., 2020;Kaushik et al., 2019;Schlegel et al., 2021). We believe these two lines of work are complementary to each other, and both should be explored in future research to measure models' robustness more comprehensively.

One alternative notion is whether the perturbation from x to x is ""semantic-preseving"" (Alzantot et al., 2018;Jin et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2019) or ""semantic-modifying"" (Shi and Huang, 2020;Jia and Liang, 2017).

LSTM-Shuttle (Fu and Ma, 2018) proposes a bidirectional shuttling mechanism, which can jump multiple time steps both forward and backward, allowing the model to ignore unimportant information and recover lost information if needed. Structural information that naturally exists in sentences can also play a role in skimming. Structural Jump-LSTM (Hansen et al., 2019) can jump to the next word, next sub-sentence separator (a comma or colon), next sentence end symbols (a period, exclamation mark or question mark), or to the end of the text (i.e., stop reading).

In the era of Transformers, there have been works attempting to reduce computation by either skip tokens at higher layers or forward tokens to higher layers. The PoWER-BERT model (Goyal et al., 2020) reduces the number of tokens processed by each Transformer layer based on their attention scores. The number of tokens to be dropped, referred to as the ""schedule,"" is optimized by combining the sparsity of a soft mask layer with the original loss function. This results in an improved balance between accuracy and processing time. TR-BERT (Ye et al., 2021) uses a dynamic approach to determine which tokens to skip, using reinforcement learning to train the model with a reward system that prioritizes classifier confidence while also penalizing the number of tokens retained. In contrast to PoWER-BERT, TR-BERT passes the skipped tokens to the final layer rather than discarding them. The Length-Adaptive Transformer (LAT, Kim and Cho, 2021) utilizes LengthDrop to randomly skip tokens during pretraining, aiming to close the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning. The schedule for LAT is found through an evolutionary search algorithm. LTP ) trains a threshold for each Transformer layer, instead of following a predetermined schedule. It simply drops tokens with attention scores lower than the learned threshold. Transkimmer (Guan et al., 2022) incorporates a skim predictor module, consisting of a small MLP and Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, before each layer. This module outputs a mask to determine whether a token should be dropped, and a skim loss is used to optimize the ratio of skipped tokens to total tokens, promoting sparsity.

Computation Reduction Different from skipping, computation reduction applies a reduced computational workload for some time steps instead of skipping it completely. VCRNN (Jernite et al., 2017) explores a scheduler to decide which proportion of computation to use for each time step. Upon making the decision, only the corresponding proportion of the weight matrix will be used to update the hidden states while the rest part of the weight matrix will be masked out with zero.

Instead of using part of weights to update the hidden states, Skim-RNN (Seo et al., 2018) has a big RNN and a separate small RNN. At each time step, the model decides whether to read or skim based on hidden states from the last time step and the input token. If the model decides to skim, the small RNN will update only a fraction of the hid-den states. Otherwise, a regular full update will be conducted by the big RNN.

Dynamic Hierarchical RNN Different from the aforementioned two categories of skimming, dynamic hierarchical RNN can increase computation by calling the upper layer RNN when needed. HM-RNN (Chung et al., 2017) automatically discovers the hierarchical multi-scale structure in the data for a hierarchical RNN architecture. In addition to the update and copy operations as in Skip RNN (Campos et al., 2018), they add a flush operation which ejects the summarized representation of the current time step to the upper layer and reinitializes the states for the next time step.

In question answering, only a small portion of tokens are relevant and can be used to answer the question while the rest can be safely skimmed. Based on this observation, Focused Hierarchical RNN (Ke et al., 2018) aims to only pick up information that is relevant to the query for question answering. It applies a binary gate to control whether to update the upper layer of the RNN, based on the current hidden states of the lower-level RNN and the question embedding.","[['b10', 'b30', 'b3', 'b50', 'b64', 'b15', 'b65'], ['b14', 'b4', 'b10', 'b23', 'b24', 'b13', 'b15', 'b19', 'b47', 'b63'], ['b24', 'b13', 'b14', 'b63'], ['b19'], ['b47'], ['b3', 'b4'], ['b23']]","[['b10', 'b30', 'b3', 'b50', 'b64', 'b15', 'b65'], ['b14', 'b4', 'b10', 'b23', 'b24', 'b13', 'b15', 'b19', 'b47', 'b63'], ['b24', 'b13', 'b14', 'b63'], ['b19'], ['b47'], ['b3', 'b4'], ['b23']]",26,"sent1: Operation options LSTM-Jump (Yu et al., 2017) hidden states skip multiple steps; stop reading Skip RNN (Campos et al., 2018) states of the update gate; hidden states skip a single step ReasoNet (Shen et al., 2017) hidden states stop reading Jumper  input sentence; hidden states stop reading RIM (Li et al., 2019) input sentence; hidden states skip a single step; stop reading Yu et al.

Intuitively, skimming matches how human beings efficiently read text and extract information from it (Li et al., 2019). By em-phasizing the important information within a sequence and ignoring parts with little importance, skimming helps the model achieve faster inference speed and better capture long-term dependencies. The three categories of skimming are skipping and early stopping, computation reduction, and dynamic hierarchical RNN, corresponding with three motivations: to skip unimportant input, to allocate less computation to unimportant input, and to increase computation to important input only.

Skipping and Early Stopping Skipping and early stopping aim to improve efficiency for a long sequence by skipping some tokens or stopping reading early. LSTM-Jump (Yu et al., 2017) is a skipping mechanism to ignore irrelevant information for natural language understanding (NLU). At each step, the current states are used to compute a ""jumping softmax"", which decides how many steps to jump forward and whether to stop reading. LSTM-Jump employs policy gradient to train the model to make non-differentiable discrete jumping decisions. The reward is a binary function which rewards a correct prediction and penalizes an incorrect prediction of the label. Compared to a standard LSTM, LSTM-Jump achieves better accuracy with up to 6× speed-up. Skip RNN (Campos et al., 2018) introduces a binary gate to learn whether to skip a state update. If the gate decides to skip a time step, the hidden states will be directly copied without any update.

To stop reading early as needed, Rea-soNet (Shen et al., 2017) introduces a terminal state which decides whether to terminate early for machine reading comprehension on each time step at the token level. Jumper  first splits a paragraph to several sub-sentences and encodes them into sentence embeddings. They then apply early stopping at a sentence when the policy network decides to stop reading. Li et al. (2019) use eye-tracking devices and confirm that skipping and early stopping are common when humans read text. They propose Reading Inspired Model to mimic the behaviors of humans, which allows the model to decide whether to skip a single time step or stop reading early. Yu et al.

Ensemble-based Early Exit One drawback in confidence-based early exit is wasted computation. That is to say, if the confidence of an internal classifier does not satisfy the exit criterion, it will be disregarded. Ensemble-based early exit recycles these predictions and considers output from multiple internal classifiers to make better predictions. Based on the similarity between overfitting and overthinking, PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) borrows early stopping from model training. They first jointly train the internal classifiers with BERT by a weighted sum of cross-entropy losses that assigns larger weights for upper classifiers. For inference, the model exits when k consecutive internal classifiers make the same prediction. Other than improvement on performance and efficiency, they find that PABEE can improve adversarial robustness, which they attribute to the ensemble effect.  further introduce a diversity loss that encourages internal classifiers to have a diverse predicted probability distribution. They propose a voting mechanism to ensemble the internal classifiers by exiting early when a class has accumulated more votes than the threshold. Interestingly, LeeBERT (Zhu, 2021) adopts the opposite strategy: they promote consistency across internal classifiers by distilling them to each other. However, they introduce a learnable weight for the cross-entropy loss of each classifier and the distillation loss between each pair. They optimize these weights by a cross-level optimization algorithm.

They adopt PABEE's patience-based strategy for exiting. Liao et al. (2021) train linear transformation layers called ""imitation learners"", to approximate the hidden states of future layers based on current hidden states. For inference, the prediction after each layer is calculated by mixing the past predictions and the future predictions of the imitation learners. Entropy is used as the exit criterion. PCEE-BERT (Zhang et al., 2022a) borrows from both ensemble-based exit and confidencebased methods. The inference is terminated when multiple layers are confident.

Learning-based Early Exit Another stream of research is to learn a criterion for early exiting.

BERxiT (Xin et al., 2021) alternates between joint fine-tuning and two-stage fine-tuning by freezing parameters of Transformer and the final classifier for even-numbered iterations and unfreezing them for odd-numbered iterations. They also train a linear layer called a learning-to-exit (LTE) module to predict whether the current internal classifier makes the correct prediction. It takes the hidden states as input and outputs a confidence score, which is used to decide whether to exit. CAT (Schuster et al., 2021) introduces a ""meta consistency classifier"" to predict whether the output of an internal classifier conforms to the final classifier and exits when the consistency classifier predicts a certain level of conformity.

Cascading Cascading can be seen as a special form of early exit, performed at the model level. Li et al. (2021a) find that shallow features and internal classifiers in the first few layers of BERT utilized by early exit methods like DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) are not sufficient and reliable, underperforming a fine-tuned BERT with the same number of layers. Therefore, they propose to use a suite of complete models with different numbers of layers for cascading. CascadeBERT executes models one by one, from the smallest to the largest. It stops when a model outputs a confidence score (calibrated maximum class probability) that reaches the threshold.

Applications Although early exit is originally developed for classification, there have been works extending it to more tasks and settings. Li et al. (2021b) propose Token-Level Early-Exit that targets early exiting for sequence labeling. They use the maximum class probability as confidence on a per-token basis. Once the confidence hits the threshold, the hidden states of the corresponding tokens will be frozen and directly copied to upper layers. These exited tokens will not attend to other tokens at upper layers but can still be attended by other tokens. The model completely exits when every token exits. A similar idea is also presented in Elbayad et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2021b) where hidden states of some positions can be frozen and directly copied to upper layers, although the former is focused on generation and the latter is for classification. Xin et al. (2020a) apply DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) to document ranking and set different thresholds to the negative and positive classes for early exiting, to accommodate the imbalanced class distribution in document ranking. ELUE (Liu et al., 2021a) is a benchmark which evaluates the Pareto Front of early exit models on the FLOPs-performance plane. They provide a BERT-like baseline with jointly pretrained internal classifiers, to mitigate the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning.","[['b72', 'b70', 'b56', 'b11', None], ['b45', 'b57'], ['b29'], ['b72', 'b70'], [None, 'b67'], [], ['b45', 'b57'], ['b29', 'b56'], ['b56', 'b55', 'b37', None, 'b8']]","[['b72', 'b70', 'b56', 'b11', None], ['b45', 'b57'], ['b29'], ['b72', 'b70'], [None, 'b67'], [], ['b45', 'b57'], ['b29', 'b56'], ['b56', 'b55', 'b37', None, 'b8']]",21,"sent1: DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) two-stage; sum of CE loss entropy < θ RightTool (Schwartz et al., 2020) joint; sum of CE loss calibrated max class probability > θ FastBERT  two-stage; self-distillation entropy <

sent30: Li et al. (2021a) find that shallow features and internal classifiers in the first few layers of BERT utilized by early exit methods like DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) are not sufficient and reliable, underperforming a fine-tuned BERT with the same number of layers.
sent31: Therefore, they propose to use a suite of complete models with different numbers of layers for cascading.
sent32: CascadeBERT executes models one by one, from the smallest to the largest.
sent33: It stops when a model outputs a confidence score (calibrated maximum class probability) that reaches the threshold.
sent34: Applications Although early exit is originally developed for classification, there have been works extending it to more tasks and settings.
sent35: Li et al. (2021b) propose Token-Level Early-Exit that targets early exiting for sequence labeling.
sent36: They use the maximum class probability as confidence on a per-token basis.
sent37: Once the confidence hits the threshold, the hidden states of the corresponding tokens will be frozen and directly copied to upper layers.
sent38: These exited tokens will not attend to other tokens at upper layers but can still be attended by other tokens.
sent39: The model completely exits when every token exits.
sent40: A similar idea is also presented in Elbayad et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2021b) where hidden states of some positions can be frozen and directly copied to upper layers, although the former is focused on generation and the latter is for classification.
sent41: Xin et al. (2020a) apply DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) to document ranking and set different thresholds to the negative and positive classes for early exiting, to accommodate the imbalanced class distribution in document ranking.
sent42: ELUE (Liu et al., 2021a) is a benchmark which evaluates the Pareto Front of early exit models on the FLOPs-performance plane.
sent43: They provide a BERT-like baseline with jointly pretrained internal classifiers, to mitigate the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning."

Sparsely-Gated MoE layer  contains up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks with a trainable gating network which determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. There are two major challenges to address: (1) Sparsity. The gating network predicts a softmax weight for the experts based on the input. The gating network is trained by simple back-propagation, together with other parts of the model. Then, only the top-k experts in the layer will be activated based on the softmax prediction of the gating network. They insert one MoE layer between stacked LSTM layers and achieve improvement on language modeling and machine translation tasks.

(2) Load balancing.  observe a self-reinforcing phenomenon that the gating network tends to converge to a state where it always produces large weights for the same few experts. They resolve the problem by defining the importance of an expert relative to a batch of training examples to be batch-wise sum of the gate values for that expert. Then, they introduce an additional loss, the square of the coefficient of variation of the set of importance values, to encourage a more balanced update during training. Besides encouraging a balanced update, the authors also introduce a loss function with a smooth estimator that estimate the number of examples assigned to each expert for a batch of inputs, to encourage experts to receive roughly equal numbers of training examples.

GShard  enables scaling up multilingual neural machine translation Transformer beyond 600 billion parameters. It adapts Sparsely-Gated MoE  to Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) by replacing every other feed forward layer with an MoE layer, which routes to top-2 experts. When scaling to multiple devices, the MoE layer is sharded across devices, i.e., each device has different allocated experts, while all other layers are replicated. To achieve workload balance, GShard employs a threshold, namely expert capacity, to limit the maximum number of tokens processed by one single expert. They also introduce a local group dispatching mechanism, which partitions all tokens in a training batch evenly into groups to be processed independently in parallel, to balance the overall workload. Following , they use an additional loss to enforce even top-2 expert capacity; local group dispatching; auxiliary loss; random routing Switch (Fedus et al., 2021) Transformer (T5) top-1 expert capacity; auxiliary loss BASE (Lewis et al., 2021) Transformer (GPT) top-1 linear assignment M6-T  Transformer (M6) k top-1 expert capacity DTS (Nie et al., 2021) Transformer (GPT) dynamic sparsity scheduler

Hash (Roller et al., 2021) Transformer hash deterministic hash THOR (Zuo et al., 2022) Transformer (NMT) random random selection allocation for experts. Additionally, they propose a random routing mechanism, which only routes to the second-best expert with probability proportional to its weight, to simplify sparse training. Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021) aims to simplify the Sparsely-Gated MoE  for efficiency and performance. They propose a Switch Layer which only routes to one expert at a time, to reduce gating computation, batch size and communication costs. Switch Transformer inherits expert capacity and an auxiliary load balancing loss from GShard . Combined with low-precision training, compared to T5-Base and T5-Large (Raffel et al., 2020), Switch Transformer obtains up to 7× increases in pretraining speed with the same computational resources. They further scale Switch Transformer to more than 1.5 trillion parameters and achieve 4× speed-up over T5-XXL.

The Balanced Assignment of Sparse Experts (BASE) layer (Lewis et al., 2021) formulates token-to-expert allocation as a linear assignment problem and solves it with the auction algorithm (Bertsekas, 1992). This allows an optimal assignment in which each expert receives an equal number of tokens, improving efficiency and getting rid of the expert capacity and auxiliary loss in previous works. The experiments show that BASE layers are more efficient for training compared to Sparsely-Gated MoE layers  and Switch Layers (Fedus et al., 2021), and can successfully learn a good balanced routing without any auxiliary balancing loss.

M6 ) is a multi-modal multitask Transformer, trained in the same way as Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021), scaling up to 100B parameters. Following this, M6-T  splits experts into k prototypes (i.e., groups of experts). In each forward pass, each token is sent to the k prototypes, within which the top-1 routing is done lo-cally. The experiments demonstrate this ""k top-1"" strategy outperforms the top-1 routing in Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021) while being more computation-efficient than ""top-k"" routing. They also claim that the load balancing loss may be ineffective for improving the performance of an MoE model, although it can indeed help balance the workload. They subsequently train a 1 trillion parameter model with the finding.

Dense-to-Sparse gate (Nie et al., 2021) begins as a dense gate that routes tokens to all experts then gradually learns to become sparser and route tokens to fewer experts, demonstrating higher training efficiency in experiments. Their experiments confirm the finding in  that an auxiliary load balancing loss does not improve the model performance.

MoE Layer with Unlearnable Routing Although learning-based routing has shown effectiveness only with the help of complicated load balancing mechanisms, recent studies have attempted to get rid of those. Hash Layer (Roller et al., 2021) simplifies routing by using a parameter-free hashing function to route tokens to specific experts. This design eliminates the need for a load balancing loss and sophisticated assignment algorithms. They also study the performance of different hashing techniques, hash sizes and input features, and conclude that balanced and random hashes focused on the most local features work best. The experiments show that a Hash Layer achieves comparable performance with a Switch Layer (Fedus et al., 2021) and BASE Layer (Lewis et al., 2021).

During inference, one expert will be randomly selected to be activated.","[[], [], ['b28', 'b9', 'b53', None], ['b73', 'b43', 'b9', 'b41'], ['b28', 'b9', 'b1'], ['b9'], [None], ['b28', 'b43', 'b9'], ['b73']]","[[], [], ['b28', 'b9', 'b53', None], ['b73', 'b43', 'b9', 'b41'], ['b28', 'b9', 'b1'], ['b9'], [None], ['b28', 'b43', 'b9'], ['b73']]",17,"sent1: A straightforward idea to implement MoE is to learn a router to allocate inputs to experts.

248426721,What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? A Survey on Datasets and Study on Scientific Relation Classification,Computer Science,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29a369d83a7d6a49f6a3259bee23bd4d95db0b16,s2,The Relation Extraction Task,"Conceptually, RE involves a pipeline of steps (see Figure 2). Starting from the raw text, the first step consists in identifying the entities and eventually assigning them a type. Entities involve either nominals or named entities, and hence it is either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or, more broadly, Mention Detection (MD). 5 After entities are identified, approaches start to be more blurry as studies have approached RE via different angles.

One way is to take two steps, Relation Identification (RI) and subsequent Relation Classification (RC) , as illustrated in Figure 2. This means to first identify from all the possible entity pairs the ones which are in some kind of relation via a binary classification task (RI). As the proportion of positive samples over the negative is usually extremely unbalanced towards the latter (Gormley et al., 2015), a priori heuristics are generally applied to reduce the possible combinations (e.g., entity pairs involving distant entities, or entity type pairs not licensed by the relations are not even considered). The last step (RC) is usually a multi-class classification to assign a relation type r to the positive samples from the previous step. Some studies merge RI and RC (Seganti et al., 2021) into one step, by adding a no-relation (no-rel) label. Other studies instead reduce the task to RC, and assume there exists a relation between two entities and the task is to determine the type (without a no-rel label). Regardless, RI is influenced by the RC setup: Relations which are not in the RC label set are considered as negative samples in the RI phase. Some studies address this approximation by distinguishing between the no-rel and the None-Of-The-Above (NOTA) relation (Gao et al., 2019). Note that, in our definition, the NOTA label differs from no-rel in the sense that a relation holds between the two entities, but its type is not in the considered RC label set. 6 What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? RE studies rarely address the whole pipeline. We 5 Some studies divide the entity extraction into two substeps: identification (often called MD), and subsequent classification into entity types. 6 Some studies name such relation Other (Hendrickx et al., 2010). analyze all the ACL papers published in the last five years which contain the Relation Extraction keyword in the title and determine which sub-task is performed (NER/MD, RI, RC). Table 2 shows such investigation. We leave out from this analysis (a) papers which make use of distant supervision or which somehow involve knowledge bases, (b) shared task papers, (c) the bioNLP field, (d) temporal RE, and (e) Open RE. The result shows that gold entities are usually assumed for RE, presumably given the complexity of the NER/MD task on its own. Most importantly, for end-to-end models, recent work has shown that ablations for steps like NER are lacking (Taillé et al., 2020). Our analysis further shows that it is difficult to determine the RI setup. While RC is always performed, the situation is different for RI (or no-rel). Sometimes RI is clearly not done (i.e., the paper assumes a scenario in which every instance contains at least one relation), but most of the times it is either not clear from the paper, or done in a simplified scenario (e.g., datasets which already clear out most of the no-rel entity pair instances). As this blurriness hampers fair evaluation, we propose that studies clearly state which step they include, i.e., whether the work focus is on RC, RI+RC or the full RE pipeline and how special cases (no-rel and NOTA) are handled. These details are utterly important as they impact both model estimation and evaluation.

Pipeline or Joint Model? The traditional RE pipeline is, by definition of pipeline, prone to error propagation by sub-tasks. Joint entity and relation extraction approaches have been proposed in order to alleviate this problem (Miwa and Bansal, 2016;Zhang et al., 2017a;Bekoulis et al., 2018a,b;Wang and Lu, 2020;Wang et al., 2021). However, Taillé et al. (2020) recently discussed the challenge of properly evaluating such complex models. They surveyed the evaluation metrics of recently published works on end-to-end RE referring to the Strict, Boundaries, Relaxed evaluation setting pro-  posed by Bekoulis et al. (2018a). They observe unfair comparisons and overestimations of end-toend models, and claim the need for more rigorous reports of evaluation settings, including detailed datasets statistics. While some recent work shifts to joint models, it is still an open question which approach (joint or pipeline) is the most robust. Zhong and Chen (2021) found that when incorporating modern pretrained language models (e.g., BERT) using separate encoders can surpass existing joint models. Since the output label space is different, separate encoders could better capture distinct contextual information. At the moment it is not clear if one approach is more suitable than the other for RE.

We survey widely used RE datasets in chronological order, and broadly classify them into three domains based on the data source: (1) news and web, (2) scientific publications and (3) Wikipedia. An overview of the datasets is given in Table 1. Our empirical target here focuses on the scientific domain as so far it has received no attention in the cross-domain direction; a similar investigation on overlaps in data, annotation, and model transferability between datasets in other domains is interesting future work. The CoNLL 2004 dataset (Roth and Yih, 2004) is one of the first works. It contains annotations for named entities and relations in news articles. In the same year, the widely studied ACE dataset was published by Doddington et al. (2004). It contains annotated entities, relations and events in broadcast transcripts, newswire and newspaper data in English, Chinese and Arabic. The corpus is divided into six domains.

Another widely used dataset is The New York Times (NYT) Annotated Corpus, 3 first presented by Riedel et al. (2010). It contains over 1.8 million articles by the NYT between 1987 and 2007. NYT has been created with a distant supervision approach (Mintz et al., 2009), using Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008 as knowledge base. Two further versions of it followed recently: Zhu et al. (2020b) (NYT-H) and Jia et al. (2019) published manually annotated versions of the test set in order to perform a more accurate evaluation.

3 http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/ RE has also been part of the SemEval shared tasks for four times so far. The two early Se-mEval shared tasks focused on the identification of semantic relations between nominals (Nastase et al., 2021). For SemEval-2007Task 4, Girju et al. (2007 released a dataset for RC into seven generic semantic relations between nominals. Three years later, for SemEval-2010 Task 8, Hendrickx et al. (2010) revised the annotation guidelines and published a corpus for RC, by providing a much larger dataset (10k instances, in comparison to 1.5k of the 2007 shared task).

Since 2017, three RE datasets in the scientific domain emerged, two of the three as SemEval shared tasks. In SemEval-2017 Task 10 Augenstein et al. (2017) proposed a dataset for the identification of keyphrases and considered two generic relations (HYPONYM-OF and SYNONYM-OF). The dataset is called ScienceIE and consists of 500 journal articles from the Computer Science, Material Sciences and Physics fields. The year after, Gábor et al. (2018) proposed a corpus for RC and RE made of abstracts of scientific papers from the ACL Anthology for SemEval-2018 Task 7. The data will be described in further detail in Section 4.1. Following the same line, Luan et al. (2018) published SCIERC, which is a scientific RE dataset further annotated for coreference resolution. It contains abstracts from scientific AI-related conferences. From the existing three scientific RE datasets summarized in Table 1, in our empirical investigation we focus on two (SemEval-2018 and SCIERC). We leave out ScienceIE as it focuses on keyphrase extraction and it contains two generic relations only.

The Wikipedia domain has been first introduced in 2013. Google released GoogleRE, 4 a RE corpus consisting of snippets from Wikipedia. More recently, Kassner et al. (2021) proposed mLAMA, a multilingual version (53 languages) of GoogleRE with the purpose of investigating knowledge in pretrained language models. The multi-lingual dimension is gaining more interest for RE. Following this trend, Seganti et al. (2021) presented SMiLER, a multilingual dataset (14 languages) from Wikipedia with relations belonging to nine domains.

Previous datasets were restricted to the same label collection in the training set and in the test set. To address this gap and make RE experimental scenarios more realistic, Han et al. (2018) -2007- Girju et al. (2007 Sentences from the web 7 SemEval-2010 Hendrickx et al. (2010) Sentences from the web 10 TACRED Zhang et al. (2017b) Newswire and web text 42 FSL TACRED Sabo et al. (2021) TACRED   Back to the news domain, Zhang et al. (2017b) published a large-scale RE dataset built over newswire and web text, by crowdsourcing relation annotations for sentences with named entity pairs. This resulted in the TACRED dataset with over 100k instances, which is particularly well-suited for neural models. Sabo et al. (2021) used TA-CRED to make a FSL RC dataset and compared it to FewRel 1.0 and FewRel 2.0, aiming at a more realistic scenario (i.e., non-uniform label distribution, inclusion of pronouns and common nouns).

All datasets so far present a sentence level annotation. To address this, Yao et al. (2019) published DocRED, a document-level RE dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata. The difference with a traditional sentence-level corpus is that both the intraand inter-sentence relations are annotated, increasing the challenge level. In addition to RE, DocRED annotates coreference chains. DWIE by Zaporojets et al. (2021) is another document-level dataset, specifically designed for multi-task IE (Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Relation Extraction, and Entity Linking).

Lastly, there are works focusing on creating datasets for specific RE aspects. Cheng et al. (2021), for example, proposed a Chinese documentlevel RE dataset for hard cases in order to move towards even more challenging evaluation setups.

Domains in RE Given our analysis, we observe a shift in target domains: from news text in seminal works, over web texts, to emerging corpora in the scientific domain and the most recent focus on Wikipedia. Similarly, we observe the emerging trend for FSL.

Different datasets lend themselves to study different aspects of the task. Concerning crossdomain RE, we propose to distinguish three setups:

1. Data from different domains, but same relation types, which are general enough to be present in each domain (limited and often confined to the ACE dataset) (e.g., Plank and Moschitti, 2013).

In the case study of this paper, given the scientific datasets available, we focus on the first setup.","[[None, 'b30'], ['b29', 'b10', 'b59', None], [None, 'b7'], [None, 'b18', 'b1'], ['b32', 'b11'], ['b31', 'b7', 'b55', None, 'b6'], ['b48', 'b52'], [None], [], [], ['b25'], []]","[[None, 'b30'], ['b29', 'b10', 'b59', None], [None, 'b7'], [None, 'b18', 'b1'], ['b32', 'b11'], ['b31', 'b7', 'b55', None, 'b6'], ['b48', 'b52'], [None], [], [], ['b25'], []]",22,"sent1: RE has been broadly studied in the last decades and many datasets were published.

Evaluation requires both verifying that the content in a system-based summary follows from the original transcript and measuring the overlap with a gold-standard summary. However, given the expressive freedom encouraged by abstractive approaches, checking for semantic entailment and overlap of summary-worthy content requires deep semantic understanding, not just recognition that the same words are used.

Unfortunately, the ROUGE metric (Lin, 2004), which remains the standard for both meeting and general text summarization, scores systemproduced summaries based purely on surface lexicographic matches with a (usually single) gold summary, making it unideal for assessing abstractive summaries. If we take the abstractive summary from Figure 1 (""Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material"") as a gold example, ROUGE would assign a higher score to a system that produces ""Some part of the casing will be made of broccoli"" than one that output ""A portion of the outer layer will be constructed from a sponge-like material,"" even though the latter is a perfect reformulation of the gold summary, while the former says something very different (and false).

A reasonable way to try to improve over ROUGE would be to take advantage of massive, pretrained, contextual word embeddings and a notion of lexical similarity rather than strict lexical overlap. Some recent efforts pursue this direction (Sai et al., 2022), including BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020a) and MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019a), which aim to measure the semantic distance between the contextualized mapping of a generated summary and the reference, or BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021), which calculates the log-likelihood of a summary to have been generated, motivated by the fact that a good summary should have a high probability of being generated from a source text. Building upon these methods, DATScore and FrugalScore (Eddine et al., 2022;Kamal Eddine et al., 2022) incorporate data augmentation and knowledge distillation techniques to further improve performance and overcome their drawbacks.

Despite their rapid development, recent studies on meta-evaluation of these metrics show mixed results. Peyrard (2019) and Bhandari et al. (2020a) compare their performance in the context of document summarization and show that metrics strongly disagree in ranking summaries from any narrow scoring range, e.g., there is no consensus among metrics regarding which summary is better than another in the high scoring range in which modern systems now operate. Bhandari et al. (2020b) argue that there is no one-size-fitsall metric that correlates better with human judgement than the others, and that can outperform others on all datasets.

Clearly, evaluation is itself a very challenging task. And we note that none of these metrics even touches on another central challenge for summary evaluation, namely that of factual consistency. When we summarize a meeting or detail decisions and actions items in our own words, it is important to get the facts straight. Otherwise, the resulting summaries are not reliable for an end user. While we do not know of current work that focuses on evaluation of factuality explicitly for the meeting domain, the study of factual consistency in summarization more generally is a budding research area that we discuss in Section 6.

In the absence of a clear winner for summary evaluation metrics, none of the alternatives has yet to be widely adopted. In our comparison of different summarization systems in Section 5, we therefore stick with ROUGE, which offers the additional advantage of conceptual simplicity and lower computational cost compared to metrics based on contextual embeddings and pretrained language models.","[[], ['b17'], ['b49', 'b52', 'b27', 'b55', None], ['b6', 'b7'], [], []]","[[], ['b17'], ['b49', 'b52', 'b27', 'b55', None], ['b6', 'b7'], [], []]",8,"sent1: As noted in Section 2, the subjectivity of meeting summaries, stemming in part from the preference for abstractive summarization, complicates the evaluation task.

Drawing on similar insights, certain recent approaches exploit independent theories of discourse structure, such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; Mann and Thompson, 1987) and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT; Asher, 1993;Lascarides and Asher, 2008), to improve summarization. Accounts like RST and SDRT maintain that in a coherent conversation, each (roughly) clause-level unit should be semantically related to some other part of the conversation via a discourse relation such as Question-Answer Pair (QAP), Acknowledgement (Ack), Explanation, Contrast, etc. to reflect its contribution to the larger discourse. Each coherent discourse can thus be represented as a weakly-connected graph whose edges are labeled with discourse relations. Figure 2 il-  , 2021a). The * indicates summary-level (with sentence split) ROUGE-L score (Lin, 2004).

lustrates a possible SDRT graph for example (1).

To the best of our knowledge, Feng et al. (2020) is the first work to exploit discourse graphs to generate abstractive meeting summaries. They employ a sequential discourse parser (Shi and Huang, 2019) trained on the STAC corpus of multi-party chats (Asher et al., 2016) to automatically obtain discourse graphs for the AMI and ICSI meeting corpora. Levi graph transformation (Gross and Yellen, 2003) is then used to turn graph edges labeled with discourse relation types into vertices. Their graph-to-sequence model consists of a graph convolutional network encoder (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) that takes a meeting discourse graph as input and a PGN decoder (See et al., 2017) to generate the final summary. A dialogue-aware data augmentation strategy for constructing pseudo-summaries is introduced to pretrain the model.

An alternative approach to discourse interpretation that developed largely independently of RST and SDRT is dialogue act classification. Detailing the differences between the approaches is out of the scope of this paper, but in a nutshell, dialogue acts provide a shallower notion of discourse structure (Jurafsky et al., 1997) in that they do not entail a full graph structure over a conversation. On the other hand, systems for dialogue act labeling, such as DAMSL (Allen and Core, 1997; Core and Allen, 1997) or DiAML (Bunt et al., 2010(Bunt et al., , 2012, place more emphasis on interactive acts such as stalling to hold the floor, assessing other discourse moves, suggesting or informing.

Both the AMI and ICSI corpora provide gold dialogue act labels, and Goo and Chen (2018) use the labels from the AMI corpus to develop a sentence-gated mechanism that jointly models the relationships between dialogue acts and topic summaries to improve abstractive meeting summarization. In particular, they show that dialogue acts of the type inform are more closely linked to summary-worthy material than acts such as stall or assess. Using LSTM, their model consists of three components enhanced with various attention mechanisms: an utterance encoder, a dialogue act labeler, and a summary decoder.

Dialogue acts have also been used to good effect for summarizing decisions. Fernández et al. (2008) and Bui et al. (2009) first identify relevant areas of decision-related discussion in meetings and classify them as decision-related dialogue acts including the issue under discussion, its resolution, or agreement with the proposed resolution. Then, key fragments of the decision related utterances are retained to form an extractive decision summary. Similar ideas can also be found in the literature on detecting and summarizing action-item-specific dialogue acts in meetings (Purver et al., 2006(Purver et al., , 2007.","[['b21', None, 'b17', 'b1'], [], ['b31', 'b2', None], [None, 'b10', 'b0', 'b11'], [], [None, 'b9']]","[['b21', None, 'b17', 'b1'], [], ['b31', 'b2', None], [None, 'b10', 'b0', 'b11'], [], [None, 'b9']]",13,"sent1: While most work on abstractive meeting summarization implicitly assumes that conversation is merely a linear sequence of utterances without semantic relations between them, example (1) underscores the importance of semantic relations for conversational understanding.

Koay et al. (2021) separate ICSI meetings with a sliding window, and then apply BART on each segment to produce smaller summaries, which are concatenated into an overall extractive summary. Zhang et al. (2022) propose SUMM N , a multi-stage split-thensummarize framework. Within each stage, it first splits the source input into sufficiently short segments. Coarse summaries are then generated for each segment and then concatenated as the input to the next stage. This process is conducted repetitively until a final, fine-grained abstractive meeting summary is produced.

While such segmenting approaches address the length problem, they can lose important crosspartition information (Beltagy et al., 2020), a risk that has led researchers to seek more sophisticated solutions to the length problem. Long-sequence transformers. Multiple variants of adapting transformer-based approaches to address the lengthy input problem exist in the literature (Dai et al., 2019;Beltagy et al., 2020;Martins et al., 2022). Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), for example, introduces a multi-layer selfattention operation that scales linearly with sequence length, enabling it to process long meet-ing transcriptions. Although these models are not initially proposed for abstractive meeting summarization, recent benchmarks show their promise (Fabbri et al., 2021) in comparison with certain dedicated systems. Hierarchical transformers. Some systems leverage transformers in a hierarchical manner, breaking down a long meeting transcript to multiple relatively shorter sequences of different levels, mirroring the underlying hierarchical structure of text (Yang et al., 2016), i.e., words combine into an utterance, and utterances form a transcription. The HMNet model, proposed by Zhu et al. (2020), follows a two-level structure. First, each utterance in the meeting is separately encoded by the same word-level transformer encoder, resulting in a sequence of utterance vectors. That sequence is then processed by the turn-level encoder. The transformer decoder makes use of both levels of representation via cross-attention layers. Rohde et al. (2021) propose Hierachical Attention Transformer (HAT). Utterances are first prepended with a special BOS token. Then, after obtaining token-level embeddings with a standard transformer encoder, the BOS token embeddings are fed into an extra layer, yielding sentence-level representations. Finally, the decoder leverages the outputs at both levels to produce a final summary. Similarly, the hierarchical encoder of (Zhao et al., 2019b) consists of three levels, sequentially encoding word, utterance and topic segment embeddings.","[[None, 'b54'], ['b4', 'b56', 'b26', None, 'b60', 'b22', 'b48']]","[[None, 'b54'], ['b4', 'b56', 'b26', None, 'b60', 'b22', 'b48']]",9,"sent1: A straightforward solution to the length problem is to segment a long document into smaller segments to be processed.

sent12: The HMNet model, proposed by Zhu et al. (2020), follows a two-level structure.
sent13: First, each utterance in the meeting is separately encoded by the same word-level transformer encoder, resulting in a sequence of utterance vectors.
sent14: That sequence is then processed by the turn-level encoder.
sent15: The transformer decoder makes use of both levels of representation via cross-attention layers.
sent16: Rohde et al. (2021) propose Hierachical Attention Transformer (HAT).
sent17: Utterances are first prepended with a special BOS token.
sent18: Then, after obtaining token-level embeddings with a standard transformer encoder, the BOS token embeddings are fed into an extra layer, yielding sentence-level representations.
sent19: Finally, the decoder leverages the outputs at both levels to produce a final summary.
sent20: Similarly, the hierarchical encoder of (Zhao et al., 2019b) consists of three levels, sequentially encoding word, utterance and topic segment embeddings."

It is thus reasonable to think that harnessing this information could lead to improved performance over a summarization system that draws on speech transcripts alone. Indeed, Li et al. (2019) has shown that the Visual Focus Of Attention (VFOA), which is estimated based on a participant's head orientation and eye gaze, can help a multi-modal summarization system determine salient utterances, thereby improving the quality of abstractive meeting summaries. In this work, VFOA is integrated with attention mechanisms in a PGN text decoder and topic segmenter trained in a multi-task learning setting.

In the context of extractive meeting summarization, Erol et al. (2003) exploits multimodality to select segments of meeting video recordings in order to facilitate browsing of the videos for important information. Along with TF-IDF text analysis of the speech transcript, their system attends to certain visual motion activities (e.g., someone entering the meeting room or standing up to make a presentation) and to acoustic features (e.g., speech volume and degree of interaction) to enhance detection of summary-worthy events. Similar ideas can be found in Xie and Liu (2010);Nihei et al. (2016Nihei et al. ( , 2018; Nihei and Nakano (2019).

Of course, enhancing meeting transcripts with information to improve interpretation comes at a cost: most annotations are performed manually and require linguistic expertise to do well, and annotations produced automatically, as in Shi and Huang (2019) or Shang et al.

However, since these datasets are adapted from real-life applications, most of them contain domain knowledge (Gan et al., 2021b) and dataset conventions (Suhr et al., 2020). Thus, they are still valuable to evaluate models' ability to generalize to new domains and explore how to incorporate domain knowledge and dataset convention to model predictions.

Appendix B gives a detailed discussion on domain knowledge and dataset convention, and concrete text-to-SQL examples.

Large Scale Cross-domain Datasets Large cross-domain datasets such as WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) and Spider (Yu et al., 2018c) are proposed to better evaluate deep neural models. Wik-iSQL uses tables extracted from Wikipedia and lets annotators paraphrase questions generated for the tables. Compared to other datasets, WikiSQL is an order of magnitude larger, containing 80,654 natural utterances in total (Zhong et al., 2017). However, WikiSQL contains only simple SQL queries, and only a single table is queried within each SQL query (Yu et al., 2018c). Yu et al. (2018c) propose Spider, which contains 200 databases with an average of 5 tables for each database, to test models' performance on complicated unseen SQL queries and their ability to generalize to new domains. Furthermore, researchers expand Spider to study various issues of their inter-est (Lei et al., 2020;Zeng et al., 2020;Gan et al., 2021b;Taniguchi et al., 2021;Gan et al., 2021a).

Besides, researchers build several large-scale text-to-SQL datasets in different languages such as CSpider (Min et al., 2019a), TableQA (Sun et al., 2020), DuSQL (Wang et al., 2020c) in Chinese, ViText2SQL (Tuan Nguyen et al., 2020) in Vietnamese, and PortugueseSpider (José and Cozman, 2021) in Portuguese. Given that human translation has shown to be more accurate than machine translation (Min et al., 2019a), these datasets are annotated mainly by human experts based on the English Spider dataset. These Spider-based datasets can serve as potential resources for multi-lingual text-to-SQL research.

Other Datasets Several context-dependent textto-SQL datasets have been proposed, which involve user interactions with the text-to-SQL system in English (Price, 1990;Dahl et al., 1994;Yu et al., 2019a,b) and Chinese (Guo et al., 2021). In addition, researchers collect datasets to study questions in text-to-SQL being answerable or not (Zhang et al., 2020), lexicon-level mapping (Shi et al., 2020b) and cross-domain evaluation for real Web databases (Lee et al., 2021).

As summarized in § 2, datasets prior to Spider typically involve simple DBs that contain only one table or a single DB in both training and testing. As a result, modeling DB schema receives little attention. Because Spider contains complex and different DB in training and testing, Bogin et al. (2019a) propose to use graphs to represent the structure of the DB schemas. Specifically, Bogin et al. (2019a) use nodes to represent tables and columns, edges to represent relationships between tables and columns, such as tables containing columns, primary key, and foreign key constraints, and then use graph neural networks (GNNs) (Li et al., 2016) to encode the graph structure. In their subsequent work, Bogin et al. (2019b) use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture DB structures and a gated GCN to select the relevant DB information for SQL generation. RAT-SQL  encodes more relationships for DB schemas such as ""both columns are from the same table"" in their graph.

Graphs have also been used to encode questions together with DB schema. Researchers have been using different types of graphs to capture the semantics in NL and facilitate linking between NL and table schema. Cao et al. (2021) adopt line graph (Gross et al., 2018) to capture multi-hop semantics by meta-path (e.g., an exact match for a question token and column, together with the column belonging to a table can form a 2-hop meta-path) and distinguish between local and nonlocal neighbors so that different tables and columns will be attended differently. SADGA (Cai et al., 2021) adopts the graph structure to provide a unified encoding for both natural utterances and DB schemas to help question-schema linking. Apart from the relations between entities in both questions and DB schema, the structure for DB schemas, S 2 SQL (Hui et al., 2022) integrates syntax dependency among question tokens into the graph to improve model performance. To improve the generalization of the graph method for unseen domains, ShawdowGNN (Chen et al., 2021b) ignores names of tables or columns in the database and uses abstract schemas in the graph projection neural network to obtain delexicalized representations of questions and DB schemas.

Finally, graph-based techniques are also exploited in context-dependent text-to-SQL. For instance, IGSQL (Cai and Wan, 2020) uses a graph encoder to utilize historical information of DB schemas in the previous turns.

Self-attention Models using transformer-based encoder (He et al., 2019;Xie et al., 2022) incorporate the original self-attention mechanism by default because it is the building block of the transformer structure.

RAT-SQL  applies relationaware self-attention, a modified version of selfattention (Vaswani et al., 2017), to leverage relations of tables and columns. DuoRAT (Scholak et al., 2021a) also adopts such a relation-aware self-attention in their encoder.

Adapt PLM Various methods have been proposed to leverage the knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs) and better align PLM with the text-to-SQL task. PLMs such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) are used to encode questions and DB schemas. The modus operandi is to input the concatenation of question words and schema words to the BERT encoder Choi et al., 2021). Other methods adjust the embeddings by PLMs. On WikiSQL, for instance, X-SQL (He et al., 2019) replaces segment embeddings from the pre-trained encoder by column type embeddings. Guo and Gao (2019) encode two additional feature vectors for matching between question tokens and table cells as well as column names and concatenate them with BERT embeddings of questions and DB schemas.

HydraNet  uses BERT to encode the question and an individual column, aligning with the tasks BERT is pre-trained on. After obtaining the BERT representations of all columns, Lyu et al. (2020) select top-ranked columns for SQL prediction. Liu et al. (2021b) train an auxiliary concept prediction module to predict which tables and columns correspond to the question. They detect important question tokens by detecting the largest drop in the confidence score caused by erasing that token in the question. Lastly, they train the PLM with a grounding module using the question tokens and the corresponding tables as well as columns. By empirical studies, Liu et al. (2021b) claim that their approach can awaken the latent grounding from PLM via this erase-andpredict technique.

Pre-training There have been various works proposing different pre-training objectives and using different pre-training data to better align the transformer-based encoder with the text-to-SQL task. For instance, TaBERT  uses tabular data for pre-training with objectives of masked column prediction and cell value recovery to pre-train BERT. Grappa  synthesizes question-SQL pairs over tables and pre-trains BERT with the objectives of masked language modeling (MLM) and predicting whether a column appears in the SQL query as well as what SQL operations are triggered.

As shown in Table 3 Table 9 in Appendix D. IR: Intermediate Representation. and other technologies.

Tree-based Seq2Tree (Dong and Lapata, 2016) employs a decoder that generates logical forms in a top-down manner. The components in the sub-tree are generated conditioned on their parents apart from the input question. Note that the syntax of the logical forms is implicitly learned from data for Seq2Tree. Similarly, Seq2AST (Yin and Neubig, 2017) uses an abstract syntax tree (AST) for decoding the target programming language, where the syntax is explicitly integrated with AST. Although both Seq2Tree (Dong and Lapata, 2016) and Seq2AST (Yin and Neubig, 2017) do not study text-to-SQL datasets, their uses of trees inspire tree-based decoding in text-to-SQL. SyntaxSQL-Net (Yu et al., 2018b) employs a tree-based decoding method specific to SQL syntax and recursively calls modules to predict different SQL components.

Sketch-based SQLNet (Xu et al., 2017) designs a sketch aligned with the SQL grammar, and SQL-Net only needs to fill in the slots in the sketch rather than predict both the output grammar and the content. Besides, the sketch captures the dependency of the predictions. Thus, the prediction of one slot is only conditioned on the slots it depends on, which avoids issues of the same SQL query with varied equivalent serializations. Dong and Lapata (2018) decompose the decoding into two stages, where the first decoder predicts a rough sketch, and the second decoder fills in the lowlevel details conditioned on the question and the sketch. Such coarse-to-fine decoding has also been adopted in other works such as IRNet (Guo et al., 2019). To address the complex SQL queries with nested structures, RYANSQL (Choi et al., 2021) recursively yields SELECT statements and uses a sketch-based slot filling for each of the SELECT statements.

Bottom-up Both the tree-based and the sketchbased decoding mechanisms can be viewed as top-down decoding mechanisms. Rubin and Berant (2021) use a bottom-up decoding mechanism. Given K trees of height t, the decoder scores trees with height t + 1 constructed by SQL grammar from the current beam, and K trees with the highest scores are kept. Then, a representation of the new K trees is generated and placed in the new beam.

Attention Mechanism To integrate the encoderside information at decoding, an attention score is computed and multiplied with hidden vectors from the encoder to get the context vector, which is then used to generate an output token (Dong and Lapata, 2016;Zhong et al., 2017). Variants of the attention mechanism have been used to better propagate the information encoded from questions and DB schemas to the decoder. SQLNet (Xu et al., 2017) designs column attention, where it uses hidden states from columns multiplied by embeddings for the question to calculate attention scores for a column given the question. Guo and Gao (2018)  Copy Mechanism Seq2AST (Yin and Neubig, 2017) and Seq2SQL (Zhong et al., 2017) employ the pointer network (Vinyals et al., 2015) to compute the probability of copying words from the input. Wang et al. (2018a) use types (e.g., columns, SQL operators, constant from questions) to explicitly restrict locations in the query to copy from and develop a new training objective to only copy from the first occurrence in the input. In addition, the copy mechanism is also adopted in context-dependent text-to-SQL task (Wang et al., 2020b).

Intermediate Representations Researchers use intermediate representations to bridge the gap between natural language and SQL queries. Inc-SQL (Shi et al., 2018)  However, the intermediate representations are usually designed for a specific dataset and cannot be easily adapted to others (Suhr et al., 2020). To construct a more generalized intermediate representation, Herzig et al. (2021) propose to omit tokens in the SQL query that do not align to any phrase in the utterance.

Inspired by the success of text-to-SQL task, intermediate representations are also studied for SPARQL, another executable language for database systems (Saparina and Osokin, 2021;Herzig et al., 2021).

Others PICARD (Scholak et al., 2021b) and UniSAr (Dou et al., 2022) set constraints to the decoder to prevent generating invalid tokens. Several methods adopt an execution-guided decoding mechanism to exclude non-executable partial SQL queries from the output candidates (Wang et al., 2018b;. Global-GNN (Bogin et al., 2019b) employs a separately trained discriminative model to rerank the top-K SQL queries in the decoder's output beam, which is to reason about the complete SQL queries instead of considering each word and DB schemas in isolation.  (2018); Lee (2019) use separate submodules to predict different SQL components, easing the difficulty of generating a complete SQL query. Chen et al. (2020b) employ a gate to select between the output sequence encoded for the question and the output sequence from the previous decoding steps at each step for SQL generation. Inspired by machine translation, Müller and Vlachos (2019) apply byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016) to compress SQL queries to shorter sequences guided by AST, reducing the difficulties in SQL generation.","[[], ['b1', 'b26', 'b22'], [None], [], [None, 'b16', 'b22'], [None, 'b9', 'b5'], [None], [None, 'b26']]","[[], ['b1', 'b26', 'b22'], [None], [], [None, 'b16', 'b22'], [None, 'b9', 'b5'], [None], [None, 'b26']]",13,"sent1: Various methods have been proposed for decoding to achieve a fine-grained and easier process for SQL generation and bridge the gap between natural language and SQL queries.

Recently we have witnessed great improvements in sarcasm processing and in this part we will discuss how new tasks in sarcasm could motivate irony research.

Data Collection As discussed, datasets are highly dependent on hashtags as a signal to extract ironical expressions. Shmueli et al. (2020) proposed an algorithm to detect sarcastic tweets from a thread based on exterior cue tweets. A distant supervision based method for extracting ironies from platforms is crucial, given ironies in conversational contexts are central topic in the future.

Intended and Perceived Irony Oprea and Magdy (2019) explored how author profiling affected the perceived sarcasm (manual labelling) versus the intended sarcasm (hashtags), and verified the difference between both. Further, Oprea and Magdy (2020) introduced iSarcasm dataset which divided intended sarcasms and perceived sarcasms. The state-of-the-art sarcasm detection models performed obviously worse than human evaluation on this dataset. Future work could focus on multimodal perceived and intended irony, especially across various cultures.

Target Identification Sarcasm target identification was firstly proposed in Joshi et al. (2018), in which sarcasm targets were classified as one target, several targets and outside. Patro et al. (2019) introduced sociolinguistic features and a deep learning framework, and improved target identification by a lot. For irony processing, most ironical expressions do not equip a specific target in itself as previously discussed. However, its ironical effects are likely in dialogue or visually grounded environment, which encourages us to enhance irony datasets in aforementioned ways.

Irony Explanation Irony, according to the definition, have opposite real meanings to literal meanings. However, this does not mean adding a single negation could interpret ironies well. Kumar et al.

Early studies suggested that irony is the expression whose real meaning is contradictory to its literal meaning (Grice, 1975). The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, The Oxford English Dictionary, and The Collins English Dictionary all adopted this definition and used the words ""opposite"" or ""contrary"" to explain the relationship between the literal and contextual meanings of irony.

However, more research into various types of ironic examples revealed that the contextual meaning of irony does not have to be ""opposite"" or ""contrary"" to the literal one. According to Sperber and Wilson (1986); Wilson and Sperber (2012), some expressions have no ""literal meaning"" to be challenged because no ""literal meaning"" is mentioned in the context, based on which they raised relevance theory and the ""echoic"" concept. They considered irony as ""an echoic use of language in which the speaker tacitly dissociates herself from an attributed utterance or thought"" (Wilson, 2006). That is, if the ""echoic use"" is incongruous in some ways, the expression can be ironic. Based on this theory, Seto (1998) put forward that there are some ""echo-markers"" like definitely, really, and indeed.

Li and Huang (2020) provided instances to show that ""incongruity"" does not have to be between the literal and contextual meanings of irony in certain circumstances. They believed that irony's true nature is a psychological activity as much as a verbal representation. The speaker or listeners must finish the ""reversal"" process on a psychological level for it to be completed.

Be polite: According to Brown et al. (1987), when unfavorable attitudes such as resistance, criticism, and complaints are stated with irony, the threat to the listener's reputation is reduced. The irony, as stated in Giora (1995), is an indirect negation. People prefer to utilize indirect negation to be polite to their listeners because direct negation can generate great unhappiness;

Ease criticisms: As reported by Dews and Winner (1995), irony helps to ease the expression's evaluative function. They believe that the incompatibility between literal meaning and contextual meaning can make it difficult to articulate negative feelings. However, Toplak and Katz (2000) argued that, while irony literally avoids conflict, it is more aggressive from the perspective of the speaker's goal;

Self-protection: Sperber and Wilson (1986) proposed the ""echoic"" idea, which stated that irony is a detached utterance that is simply an echo of another people's thought. It's a self-protection tactic, especially when the speakers are members of marginalized groups.

Sarcasm is often recognized as ""a nasty, mean-spirited, or just relatively negative form of verbal irony, used on occasion to enhance the negativity expressed relative to direct, non-figurative criticism"" (Colston, 2017).

One of the peculiarities of sarcasm is whether or not the speakers intend to offend the listeners. Kumon-Nakamura et al. (1995), for example, believe that sarcastic irony always conveys a negative attitude and is intended to harm the object being discussed. The non-sarcastic irony, on the other hand, can communicate either a good or negative attitude, and it is rarely meant to be hurtful. Barbe (1995) concurred that the core difference was ""hurtful"". She claimed that irony is a face-saving strategy while sarcasm is a face-threatening action. Ridicule is another feature of sarcasm. According to Lee and Katz (1998), sarcasm is closer to ridicule than irony. Their experiment revealed that sarcasm is directed at a single person, but irony is directed toward a large group of people. Haiman et al. (1998) claimed that one of the most distinguishing characteristics of sarcasm is that the literal meaning of its words is always positive. However, he did not convey his thoughts on irony. Whereas Littman and Mey (1991) viewed this topic from another angle. While there are many various forms of ironies, they believe that there is only one type of sarcasm because ""sarcasm cannot exist independently of the communication setting.""

Cognitive scientists approached the difference in experimental studies. Previous research in child language acquisition (Glenwright and Pexman, 2010) reported that children understood sarcastic criticism later than they could understand the nonliteral meanings of irony and sarcasm, implying different pragmatic purposes of irony and sarcasm. Filik et al. (2019) utilized fMRI and found out sarcasm is associated with wider activation of semantic network in human brains compared to irony.

However, most computational linguistics researchers used irony and sarcasm interchangeably, since the boundary between these two concepts is too vague for even human beings, let alone for machines. Joshi et al. (2016) and Sulis et al. (2016) verified this claim from both human annotators and computational perspectives. Although in this paper we will mainly focus on the literal irony processing and discuss the inspirations from recent research output in sarcasm processing, we aim to encourage unify sarcasm under the framework of irony via fine-grained annotation schemes.","[[None, 'b26', 'b23', 'b59'], [None, 'b14', 'b23', 'b25'], ['b4', 'b11'], [None, 'b55']]","[[None, 'b26', 'b23', 'b59'], [None, 'b14', 'b23', 'b25'], ['b4', 'b11'], [None, 'b55']]",12,"sent1: Most of the studies saw sarcasm as a subset of irony (Tannen et al., 2005;Barbe, 1995;Kumon-Nakamura et al., 1995;Leggitt and Gibbs, 2000;Bowes and Katz, 2011).

sent11: Haiman et al. (1998) claimed that one of the most distinguishing characteristics of sarcasm is that the literal meaning of its words is always positive.
sent12: However, he did not convey his thoughts on irony.
sent13: Whereas Littman and Mey (1991) viewed this topic from another angle.
sent14: While there are many various forms of ironies, they believe that there is only one type of sarcasm because ""sarcasm cannot exist independently of the communication setting.
sent15: ""Cognitive scientists approached the difference in experimental studies.
sent16: Previous research in child language acquisition (Glenwright and Pexman, 2010) reported that children understood sarcastic criticism later than they could understand the nonliteral meanings of irony and sarcasm, implying different pragmatic purposes of irony and sarcasm.
sent17: Filik et al. (2019) utilized fMRI and found out sarcasm is associated with wider activation of semantic network in human brains compared to irony.
sent18: However, most computational linguistics researchers used irony and sarcasm interchangeably, since the boundary between these two concepts is too vague for even human beings, let alone for machines.
sent19: Joshi et al. (2016) and Sulis et al. (2016) verified this claim from both human annotators and computational perspectives.
sent20: Although in this paper we will mainly focus on the literal irony processing and discuss the inspirations from recent research output in sarcasm processing, we aim to encourage unify sarcasm under the framework of irony via fine-grained annotation schemes."

Generally, most features could be categorized into ambiguity  and incongruity (Joshi et al., 2015). Take incongruity as an example, implicit incongruity was defined as a boolean feature checking containing implicit sentiment phrases or not; explicit incongruity was defined as number of times a polarity contrast appears. Theoretical research (Ghosh et al., 2020) is encouraging more semantic and pragmatic features to better capture ironies.

Here we outline the most popular ones.

Question answering (QA) was found to be the most common NLP task using KGs. This task is typically divided into textual QA and question answering over knowledge bases (KBQA). Textual QA derives answers from unstructured documents while KBQA does so from predefined knowledge bases (Fu et al., 2020). KBQA is naturally tied to KGs while textual QA can also be approached by using KGs as a source of common-sense knowledge when answering questions. As Zhu et al. (2021) conclude, this approach is desired not only because it is helpful for generating answers, but also because it makes answers more interpretable.

Semantic search refers to ""search with meaning"", where the goal is not just to search for literal matches, but to understand the search intent and query context as well (Bast et al., 2016). This label denoted studies that use KGs for search, recommendations, and analytics. Examples are a big semantic network of everyday concepts called ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) and a KG of scholarly communications and the relationships, among them the Microsoft Academic Graph .

Conversational interfaces constitute another NLP field that can benefit from world knowledge contained in KGs. Zhou et al. (2018)  Natural language generation (NLG) is a subfield of NLP and computational linguistics that is concerned with models which generate natural language output from scratch. KGs are used in this subfield for producing natural language text from KGs (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2019), generating question-answer pairs (Reddy et al., 2017), the multi-modal task of image captioning (Lu et al., 2018), or data augmentation in low-resource settings (Sharifirad et al., 2018).

Text analysis combines various analytical NLP techniques and methods that are applied to process and understand textual data. Exemplary tasks are sentiment detection (Kumar et al., 2018), topic modeling , or word sense disambiguation .

Augmented language models are a combination of large pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT (Radford et al., 2018) with knowledge contained in KGs. Since PLMs derive their knowledge from huge amounts of unstructured training data, a rising research trend is in combining them with structured knowledge. Knowledge from KGs can be infused into language models in their input, architecture, output, or some combination thereof (Colon-Hernandez et al., 2021).

Mehrabi et al. (2020) showed that the NER system CoreNLP  exhibits binary gender bias. They used a number of template sentences, like ""<Name> is going to school"" or ""<Name> is a person"" using male and female names 5 from 139 years of census data. The model returned more erroneous tags for female names. Similarly, Mishra et al. (2020) created synthetic sentences from adjusted Winogender (Rudinger et al., 2018) templates with names associated with different ethnicities and genders. A range of different NER systems were evaluated (bidirectional LSTMs with Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM CRF) (Huang et al., 2015) on GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) and ELMo (Peters et al., 2017) embeddings, CoreNLP, and spaCy 6 NER models). Across models, nonwhite names yielded on average lower performance scores than white names. Generally, ELMo exhibited the least bias. Although ConceptNet is debiased for gender and ethnicity 7 , it was found to produce strongly varied accuracy values. Gaut et al. (2020) analyzed binary gender bias in a popular open-source neural relation extraction (NRE) model, OpenNRE (Han et al., 2019). For this purpose, the authors created a new dataset, named WikiGenderBias (sourced from Wikipedia and DBpedia). All sentences describe a gendered subject with one of four relations: spouse, hypernym, birthData, or birthPlace (DBpedia mostly uses occupation-related hypernyms). The most notable bias found was the spouse relation. It was more reliably predicted for male than female entities. This observation stands in contrast to the predominance of female instances with spouse relation in WikiGenderBias. The authors experimented with three different mitigation strategies: downsampling the training data to equalize the number of male and female instances, augmenting the data by artificially introducing new female instances, and finally word embedding debiasing (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Only downsampling facilitated a reduction of bias that did not come at the cost of model performance.

Nowadays, contextualized transformer-based en-coders are used in various NLP applications, including NER and NRE. Several works have analyzed the various societal biases encoded in large-scale word embeddings (like word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013;Bolukbasi et al., 2016) or BERT (Devlin et al., 2019;Kurita et al., 2019)) or language models (like GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019;Kirk et al., 2021) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020;Abid et al., 2021)). Thus, it is likely that these biases also affect the downstream tasks discussed here.  used two types of tasks to analyze bias in BERT-based RE on the newly created Wiki80 and TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017) benchmarks. For the first task, they masked only entity names with a special token (masked-entity; ME), whereas for the second task, only the entity names were given (onlyentity; OE). The model maintained higher performances in the OE setting, indicating that the entity names were more informative of the predicted relation than the contextual information. This hints at what the authors call semantic bias.

A Note on Reporting Bias Generally, when extracting knowledge from text, one should be aware that the frequency with which facts are reported is not representative of their real-world prevalence. Humans tend to mention only events, outcomes, or properties that are out of their perceived ordinary (Gordon and Van Durme, 2013) (e.g., ""a banana is yellow"" is too trivial to be reported). This phenomenon is called reporting bias and likely stems from a need to be as informative and non-redundant as possible when sharing knowledge.","[['b73', 'b56', 'b78', 'b66', 'b9', 'b37', None, 'b60', 'b40', 'b67', 'b28'], ['b0', 'b59', 'b69', 'b9', 'b50', None, 'b19', 'b90', 'b47'], []]","[['b73', 'b56', 'b78', 'b66', 'b9', 'b37', None, 'b60', 'b40', 'b67', 'b28'], ['b0', 'b59', 'b69', 'b9', 'b50', None, 'b19', 'b90', 'b47'], []]",20,"sent1: Natural language processing (NLP) methods can be used to recognize and extract entities (named entity recognition; NER) and their relations (relation extraction; RE), which are then represented as [head entity, relation, tail entity] tuples (or as [subject, predicate, object], respectively).
sent2: Mehrabi et al. (2020) showed that the NER system CoreNLP  exhibits binary gender bias.
sent3: They used a number of template sentences, like ""<Name> is going to school"" or ""<Name> is a person"" using male and female names 5 from 139 years of census data.
sent4: The model returned more erroneous tags for female names.
sent5: Similarly, Mishra et al. (2020) created synthetic sentences from adjusted Winogender (Rudinger et al., 2018) templates with names associated with different ethnicities and genders.
sent6: A range of different NER systems were evaluated (bidirectional LSTMs with Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM CRF)
sent7: (Huang et al., 2015) on GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) and ELMo (Peters et al., 2017) embeddings, CoreNLP, and spaCy 6 NER models).
sent8: Across models, nonwhite names yielded on average lower performance scores than white names.
sent9: Generally, ELMo exhibited the least bias.
sent10: Although ConceptNet is debiased for gender and ethnicity 7 , it was found to produce strongly varied accuracy values.
sent11: Gaut et al. (2020) analyzed binary gender bias in a popular open-source neural relation extraction (NRE) model, OpenNRE (Han et al., 2019).
sent12: For this purpose, the authors created a new dataset, named WikiGenderBias (sourced from Wikipedia and DBpedia).
sent13: All sentences describe a gendered subject with one of four relations: spouse, hypernym, birthData, or birthPlace (DBpedia mostly uses occupation-related hypernyms).
sent14: The most notable bias found was the spouse relation.
sent15: It was more reliably predicted for male than female entities.
sent16: This observation stands in contrast to the predominance of female instances with spouse relation in WikiGenderBias.
sent17: The authors experimented with three different mitigation strategies: downsampling the training data to equalize the number of male and female instances, augmenting the data by artificially introducing new female instances, and finally word embedding debiasing (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).
sent18: Only downsampling facilitated a reduction of bias that did not come at the cost of model performance.
sent19: Nowadays, contextualized transformer-based en-coders are used in various NLP applications, including NER and NRE.
sent20: Several works have analyzed the various societal biases encoded in large-scale word embeddings (like word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013;Bolukbasi et al., 2016) or BERT (Devlin et al., 2019;Kurita et al., 2019)) or language models (like GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019;Kirk et al., 2021) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020;Abid et al., 2021)).
sent21: Thus, it is likely that these biases also affect the downstream tasks discussed here.
sent22: used two types of tasks to analyze bias in BERT-based RE on the newly created Wiki80 and TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017) benchmarks.
sent23: For the first task, they masked only entity names with a special token (masked-entity; ME), whereas for the second task, only the entity names were given (onlyentity; OE).
sent24: The model maintained higher performances in the OE setting, indicating that the entity names were more informative of the predicted relation than the contextual information.
sent25: This hints at what the authors call semantic bias.

sent27: Humans tend to mention only events, outcomes, or properties that are out of their perceived ordinary (Gordon and Van Durme, 2013) (e.g., ""a banana is yellow"" is too trivial to be reported).

Transparency and Accountability KGs should by default be published with bias-sensitive documentation to facilitate transparency and accountability regarding potential risks. Data Statements (Bender and Friedman, 2018) report curation criteria, language variety, demographics of the data authors and annotators, relevant indicators of context, quality, and provenance. Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al., 2021) additionally state motivation, composition, preparation, distribution, and maintenance. The associated questionnaire can accompany the dataset creation process to avoid risks early on. Especially in the case of ongoing crowdsourcing efforts for encyclopedic KGs the demographic background of contributors should be reported (Demartini, 2019). Researchers using subsets of these KGs, should investigate respective data dumps for potential biases and report limitations transparently. Similarly, KG embedding models should be published with Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2019) documenting intended use, underlying data, ethical considerations, and limitations. Stating the contact details for reporting problems and concerns establishes accountability (Mitchell et al., 2019;Gebru et al., 2021).

Improving Representativeness To tackle selection bias, data collection should aim to employ authors and annotators from diverse social groups and with varied cultural imprints. Annotations should be determined via aggregation (see Hovy and Prabhumoye, 2021). For open editable KGs, interventions like edit-a-thons are helpful to introduce more authors from underrepresented groups (Vetter et al., 2022) (e.g., the Art+Feminism campaign aims to fill the gender gap in Wikimedia knowledge bases 8 ). In order for such interventions to take effect, research must update data bases and benchmarks frequently (see Koch et al., 2021). In addition, the timeliness of encyclopedic data is necessary to avoid perpetuating historic biases.

Tackling Algorithmic Bias Evaluation and prevention of harmful biases must become part of the development pipeline (Stanczak and Augenstein, 2021). Algorithmic biases are best evaluated with a combination of multiple quantitative (Section 5) and qualitative measures (Kraft et al., 2022;Dev et al., 2021), considering multiple demographic dimensions (beyond gender and occupation). Evaluating the content of attributions in light of social discourse and the intended use of a technology facilitates an assessment of potential harms (Selbst et al., 2019).

sent2: Transparency and Accountability KGs should by default be published with bias-sensitive documentation to facilitate transparency and accountability regarding potential risks.

sent4: Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al., 2021) additionally state motivation, composition, preparation, distribution, and maintenance.
sent5: The associated questionnaire can accompany the dataset creation process to avoid risks early on.
sent6: Especially in the case of ongoing crowdsourcing efforts for encyclopedic KGs the demographic background of contributors should be reported (Demartini, 2019).
sent7: Researchers using subsets of these KGs, should investigate respective data dumps for potential biases and report limitations transparently.
sent8: Similarly, KG embedding models should be published with Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2019) documenting intended use, underlying data, ethical considerations, and limitations.
sent9: Stating the contact details for reporting problems and concerns establishes accountability (Mitchell et al., 2019;Gebru et al., 2021).
sent10: Improving Representativeness To tackle selection bias, data collection should aim to employ authors and annotators from diverse social groups and with varied cultural imprints.
sent11: Annotations should be determined via aggregation (see Hovy and Prabhumoye, 2021).
sent12: For open editable KGs, interventions like edit-a-thons are helpful to introduce more authors from underrepresented groups (Vetter et al., 2022) (e.g., the Art+Feminism campaign aims to fill the gender gap in Wikimedia knowledge bases 8 ).
sent13: In order for such interventions to take effect, research must update data bases and benchmarks frequently (see Koch et al., 2021).
sent14: In addition, the timeliness of encyclopedic data is necessary to avoid perpetuating historic biases.
sent15: Tackling Algorithmic Bias Evaluation and prevention of harmful biases must become part of the development pipeline (Stanczak and Augenstein, 2021).
sent16: Algorithmic biases are best evaluated with a combination of multiple quantitative (Section 5) and qualitative measures (Kraft et al., 2022;Dev et al., 2021), considering multiple demographic dimensions (beyond gender and occupation).
sent17: Evaluating the content of attributions in light of social discourse and the intended use of a technology facilitates an assessment of potential harms (Selbst et al., 2019).

Systematic deviations in the relations suggested for entities with different demographics indicate reproduced social bias. For the measurement of fairness or bias in link prediction, Keidar et al.

The assumption underlying demographic parity is that the equality between predictions for demographic counterfactuals (opposite demographics, for example, female versus male in binary understanding) is the ideal state (Dwork et al., 2012). That is, the probability of predicting a label should be the same for both groups. Predictive parity is given, on the other hand, if the probability of true positive predictions (positive predictive value or precision) is equal between groups (Chouldechova, 2017). Hence, this measure factors in the label  Bourli and Pitoura (2020) distribution by demographic. With these metrics, Keidar et al.

252819333,A Survey of Automatic Text Summarization using Graph Neural Networks,Computer Science,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/923a7db0522f53e7a01e1c7303d45fef0091fcb8,s6,Spatial Convolution and Message Passing,"One can view spatial convolution as used in GNNs as a generalization of the convolution used in neu-ral networks such as CNNs. As an example, in the case of images, one can imagine 2D convolution as being applied to a regular grid of nodes where each node represents a pixel in the image. The resulting 2D convolution applied to one target node is then the weighted average of node (pixel) values of the neighbours of the target node. Generalizing this idea to a non-regular grids leads to spatial convolution. However, different to images and regular grids, in graphs, the neighbours of each target node are unordered and can vary in number and their feature vector representation. The major challenge with this extension consists therefore in dealing with the unordered and inconsistent neighbourhood sizes inherent to homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, with an additional challenge being posed by the differing feature vector representations in heterogeneous graphs.

Directly translating the above description of convolution into a mathematical formulation leads to a valid information propagation scheme. However, such a description suffers from scalability issues due to it directly operating over the entire graph. As such modern GNNs use, what is commonly referred to as, message passing. In practice, this means that nodes within the graph exchange messages (perform convolutions) with their neighbours for a number of iterations. Thereby the network is able to diffuse information throughout the graph. Consequently, the more iterations, the further outwards information is propagated throughout the graph. In the terminology of CNNs one would say that the more message passing iterations, the larger the receptive field of the convolution. Formally, one can define message passing (Grattarola and Alippi, 2021) for each time step t as two equations:

This first equation describes how messages are generated. A differentiable function ϕ generates messages m for each edge which connects nodes using the node features and edge feature present.

The above equation is the core of the message passing framework and describes how each node feature is updated. The first part consists in the application of a permutation-invariant reduction function ρ. This function aggregates all incoming messages to a node. Then another differen-tiable function ψ combines the reduced messages received with the previous state. Using these two equations one can utilize message passing for learnable layers.

The convolution layer for a GNN is then defined with a learnable weight W such that the message per edge is m t+1 i,j = x t j and the aggregation is the normalized sum of messages, i.e.

where M (i) represents the set of messages received by node i, σ is the activation function, b is the bias, and c j,i is an appropriate scaling factor, e.g., the square root of the node degree. Note how it is important for the reduction function, in this case a sum function, to be permutation-invariant as otherwise GNNs could not handle the unordered nature of graphs.

The above presented convolution layer does not allow the model to filter unimportant neighbours. Inspired by the attention mechanism popularized by transformer networks (Vaswani et al., 2017), graph attention networks (GAT) (Veličković et al., 2018) assign attention scores to each neighbour. A schematic depiction of the two variants of spatial convolution can be seen in Figure 1 with GAT depicted on the lower part of the figure. The introduction of attention scores to the spatial convolution allows the model to explicitly assign importance to certain nodes and their messages. Just as in transformers GAT is formulated with multi-head attention. The modification to the previously presented convolution layer follows closely the common attention formulation. Formally, x t+1

where α i,j is the attention score between node i and node j and K denotes the number of concatenated heads. The attention scores are computed with

. This score is then normalized to obtain the attention score per edge α i,j = sof tmax i (r i,j ). We want to highlight here a recent development which Brody et al. (2021) simply denote as GATv2. Their main improvement aims at the fact that in the above calculation both learnable parameters a and W effectively fold into a single linear layer, thus the expressive power of the layer is less than what it could be. The fix introduced by GATv2 pulls the two parameters apart, thus achieving more expressive power while not increasing computational complexity. Taking the above description the attention score for GATv2 is modified as follows

). In both synthetic and real datasets this modification shows superior performance, which is supported by a theoretical analysis of the authors.

There are numerous modifications and extensions to the basic convolution presented here. However, for ATS models, GAT layers are dominating as the workhorse for most models. The reasoning for their dominance can be explained by the similar success that attention transformers have had in conventional neural networks for AST. We expect that GATv2 will continue this trend as it is an attractive and simple improvement for the currently dominating GAT. Although the authors of GATv2 note that it is not yet entirely clear which tasks would benefit the most from the usage of GATv2 over GAT, which will require more research and models to use GATv2.

In ATS the graphs used are in nearly all cases not homogeneous. However, the equations presented here do not work for heterogeneous graphs. The solution for this problem involves defining one convolution layer for each node type combination occurring within the graph. In the case of the already discussed sentence and word node graph there would be four possible combinations of types, and four convolution layers which would have to be defined if the graph were fully connected.

Convolution is a central aspect of GNNs, but pooling also presents an important and common operation, especially whenever GNNs are used jointly with other models. Pooling in GNNs is achieved by generating a global representation of the graph, or a subset of the graph, by pooling together features of nodes. This is usually done with some function f where f is commonly the mean, max or sum.

We want to explicitly point out to the reader that the construction of GNNs does not require special datasets. All GNN models for ATS use the common benchmark single-document and multidocument summarization datasets such as DUC 2004 or CNN/Dailymail. The only requirement for any ATS, or textual dataset, is for the designer to find an appropriate way of encoding sentences, words, subwords etc. into feature vectors, and finding a sensible way of connecting them.","[[], ['b11'], [], [], [], [], ['b31', 'b32'], [], ['b3'], [], [], [], [], []]","[[], ['b11'], [], [], [], [], ['b31', 'b32'], [], ['b3'], [], [], [], [], []]",4,"sent1: One can view spatial convolution as used in GNNs as a generalization of the convolution used in neu-ral networks such as CNNs.

(2019). In recent years GNNs have been successfully applied to a number of downstream NLP tasks such as classification    and translation (Xu et al., 2021) (Yin et al., 2020). Although GNNs may not be able to solve all problems related to the task of ATS, we believe that they can at least give a new perspective to this task. Generally GNNs bring a number of advantages to ATS which we believe to be significant enough to warrant further research, and this survey. In particular we want to highlight the following aspects of GNNs:

• Scalability and Flexibility. A vast number of ATS models are based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). However, the computational complexity of BERT-based ATS models grows quadratic with the input length; due to the selfattention operation. This fact renders them impractical for long, or even medium sized text documents. Recently some work has been done in order to circumvent this limiting factor (Ding et al., 2020) (Zhang et al., 2021). In contrast, GNNs can scale by their nature to graphs of thousands of nodes and more. This is in part due to the linear scaling of the memory cost with regards to the input size. The total memory cost of a GNN model depends on the size of the graph, the number of layers and the feature vector size of the nodes present. Formally, for L layers and an input of N nodes with each node's feature vector being of size H the memory complexity is O(LN H). But even for very large graphs on the scale of millions of nodes one can utilize GNNs. This can be achieved using methods such as neighbour sampling or distributing the graph over multiple GPUs, as done for example by Jia et al. (2020b). We recommend the paper by  for insights as to how one can train large and very deep GNNs. As the input of a GNN is a graph, the input can vary in size, therefore GNNs are also able to cope with changing text sizes and structures. Both of these aspects combined allow GNNs to produce summaries which are not restricted by hard-coded limits related to input or output size.

• Understanding and Explainability. It is often difficult to understand why a model arrived at a certain conclusion. Additionally it is often difficult to see how the model aggregates information. This is not the case with GNNs, as with the help of methods such as GNN Explainer (Ying et al., 2019) one can understand which nodes were used by the model to reach its output. This removes a layer of the blackbox magic present in many current non-GNN models. We recommend the survey by Yuan et al. (2020) for an overview of methods for generating explanations for GNNs.","[['b45', 'b42', 'b16'], ['b6', 'b48', 'b14', 'b7'], ['b46', 'b47']]","[['b45', 'b42', 'b16'], ['b6', 'b48', 'b14', 'b7'], ['b46', 'b47']]",9,"sent1: Contemporary solutions to the task of ATS suffer from a number of issues, chiefly an inconsistent evaluation protocol and, somewhat, a lack of progress, as noted by Kryściński et al.

We will do so due to the fact that this model illustrates concepts and ideas seen throughout GNNs models used for ATS. An illustration of the general concepts presented here can be seen in Figure 3.

The HSG model encodes each text into a graph with three node types, sentence nodes, word nodes and document nodes. The connection between these nodes is decided by inclusion i.e. if the word represented by a word node occurs in a sentence then their respective nodes are connected by an edge. The same principle applies to document nodes which are connected depending on whether a word, represented by a word node, occurs within the document. This is a flexible structure, as it can be used in a single-document but also multidocument setting.  Figure 3: General architecture of standalone GNNs with word nodes and sentence nodes, encoders for both node types and a sentence selection mechanism. Inspired by HSG.

The feature vectors for all nodes are obtained by encoders and the edge weights are obtained by computing the TF-IDF score for each word. The neural network consists of a modified GAT layer. The GAT is modified to consider the TF-IDF value of the connecting edge. Additionally a positionwise feed-forward (FFN) layer consisting of two linear transformations is applied to the hidden state after the convolution. In total three convolution layers are used, word-sentence, sentence-word and word-document. The model is then trained on a node-based binary classification task that is predicting whether a sentence node is to be included for the summary or not.

The classification itself is done by a single linear layer. The model then does not directly use the predicted nodes to produce the summary. Instead trigram blocking (Paulus et al., 2018) is used during sentence selection in order to ensure sparsity of the generated summary.

The results for this model are quite impressive as it outperforms non-BERT based models on both single-document and multi-document summarization for the CNN/DailyMail dataset. One should especially note the flexibility and ability to use this model for two tasks.

An older model by Muratore et al. (2010) can be considered a precursor to this architecture. A simple extension to the HSG model is proposed by Ya et al. (2021). In their extension they modify the model for query constraints for the summary. This is achieved by adding a query node to the graph structure. Additionally, they introduce a mu-tual information maximization mechanism during training.

A model which further follows this structure is the one by Linmei et al. (2019). The authors there extend the attention mechanism by adding another layer of attention, allowing it to include information about the type of the node during convolution. The GNN model by Jing et al. (2021) encodes even more information into the graph by considering the relation between sentences on a number of different levels. In particular, they encode the semantic and syntactical relationship between sentences within the graph.

This idea of encoding additional information into the graph is also followed by Antognini and Faltings (2019). They introduce an additional universal feature vector which is added to each sentence node embedding. This universal feature vector is learned from a large unrelated and general corpus. This model is also unique in that it focuses on the summarization of very small texts, on average less than 100 words.

Taking this basic structure and idea even further is the model called HAHSum by Jia et al. (2020a). The construction of the input graph for HAHSum is more involved as it aims to significantly reduce semantic sparsity by utilizing named entities. The model uses three types of nodes, named entity nodes, word nodes and sentence nodes, with the named entity nodes being anonymized tokens. The graph is then built as follows, word nodes are connected with a directed edge to a sentence node if they occur within the sentence. Two named entities are connected with an undirected edge if they represent the same entity and two sentence nodes are connected with an undirected edge if they share a trigram. Additionally, sequentially occurring words and entities are connected with a directed edge. This setup shows how one can encode a substantial amount of implicit information in an explicit manner.

HAHSum uses a GAT for each of the five node type combinations found within the graph. Just as in HSG, a FFN is applied after the multi-head attention and again as in the previous model a linear layer is used to perform the binary classification of the sentence nodes.

The results for HAHSum show that GNNs can perform very well. The authors of the paper tested the model on the CNN/Daily Mail, Newsroom and NYT dataset. The model outperforms very pow- erful models such as MATCHSUM (Zhong et al., 2020) and is even able to compete in some metrics with leading abstractive models such as PEGASUS . The results of an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment corroborate these results and show that for human readers HAHSum produce summaries with superior fluency and conciseness. Another recent GNN model which has achieved great performance in the task of multi-document summarization is the SgSum model by . Different to the approaches outlined above, the SgSum model uses graph pooling to extract sub-graphs from encoded documents. That is, it first transforms the documents into a large graph, then generates a number of sub-graphs via pooling and convolution. These sub-graphs are then ranked and thereby selected for a summary. This is quite an innovative approach as it casts the problem of multi-document summarization as a simple subgraph selection problem. Additionally, it outputs an integral summary, that is the entire summary is output by the model in the form of the sub-graph of sentences.","[[], [], [], ['b30'], [], ['b29', 'b43'], ['b43', 'b22'], ['b1'], [None], [], ['b52']]","[[], [], [], ['b30'], [], ['b29', 'b43'], ['b43', 'b22'], ['b1'], [None], [], ['b52']]",8,"sent1: We will start our discussion of standalone GNN models with HeterSumGraph (HSG), a model proposed by .

(2017). Despite being an older model it provides an illustrative introduction as to how one can effectively incorporate GNNs into established deep learning methods. As this model utilizes GNNs within a sequence-sequence architecture it falls into the encoder-decoder category of embedded GNNs. The model works exclusively with multi-document summarization. We want to note that due to the age of this model the GNN uses spectral-based convolution instead of spatial-based convolution.

As the model is an encoding-decoding embedded GNN it features three parts: the encoding part, the GNN and a decoding part. The encoding and decod-GNN CNN/DailyMail Performance Overview Model Name Type Description R-1 R-2 R-L BERTSUMEXT (Liu and Lapata, 2019) Extractive BERT baseline  Topic-Graphsum  Extractive (   Extractive (Standalone) Sentence information encoding 43.16 20.14 39.49 HSG  Extractive ( ing are done by gated recurrent networks (GRUs). More specifically, sentence encodings are produced by the encoding GRU network. These sentence encodings are then used by the GNN whose input graph consists solely of sentence nodes. The edges are determined by semantic relatedness of the sentences. The resulting sentence node feature vectors produced by the GNN are passed to the decoding GRU which computes salience scores for each sentence. The results for this model have been surpassed by other models. Similar to the GRU-GCN model, the Topic-GraphSum model by  combines an established deep neural network method with a GNN. In it a variational autoencoder is utilized for modeling topics within a given text, that is, it learns latent topics via encoding-decoding. The GNN is fed a graph consisting of topic nodes and sentence nodes. The topic node embeddings are produced by the autoencoder and the sentence node embeddings are produced by BERT. The GNN utilizes a GAT for the prediction of sentences to be used for the summary. Note that the autoencoder and the GNN are trained jointly, which is why this model is classified as an embedded model. However, as it does not utilize the encoder-decoder architecture it falls into the category of other embedded GNNs.

Another embedded GNN which does not follow the encoder-decoder schema is the model by Xu et al. (2020b). Their DISCOBERT model incorporates a GNN into a BERTSUM (Liu and Lapata, 2019) like architecture.

The DSGSum model developed by Bi et al. (2021) utilizes a GNN to enhance the semantic information provided to the model. DSGSum uses the GNN mainly for encoding entity information. The input to the GNN consists of an entity graph which has been enriched with a knowledge graph (KG); specifically, the entities and their relations as defined in the KG are encoded into the graph. The GNN then utilizes GAT to produce entity embeddings which are directly used by the decoder part of the architecture. Hence DSGSum is an embedded encoder-decoder model. All of the following embedded GNN ATS models follow the ATS GNN encoder-decoder pattern. The general principle of these models is illustrated by Figure 4. This principle being the usage of the GNN to supplement the information provided to the decoder, while also utilizing an encoder for generating the input to the GNN.

The authors of (Wu et al., 2021b) produce a graph based on the semantics of each sentence. The encoding produced by the GNN and a textual encoding of each sentence are then passed to a decoder. Similarly, the model by  uses a GNN as an encoding component. Their model utilizes the dependency tree of the input as a graph input to the GNN. It also uses a modified attention mechanism which is used to decode the attention of the GAT directly into the decoder part of the architecture. Another model in this category is the model by Liang et al. (2021). Following this idea even further is the model by Li et al. (2020). However, in contrast to DSGSum or others, their model uses a GNN directly within the transformer based encoder and decoder blocks, and not as an outside component providing additional encodings.

Another area where GNNs have found some usage is in the abstractive summarization of di-alogues, which although a niche area, is still part of the ATS task. The model by  uses a GNN to encode the structure of the conversation into their sequence-to-sequence architecture. This is also done by Feng et al. (2020). Also for dialogue summarization Feng et al. (2021) introduce a special type of graph encoding to a sequenceto-sequence architecture. They utilize a GNN as an encoder and their input graph links information about the speaker, the spoken sentences and other information together.

At this point we also want to shortly mention a few models which do not perform classical ATS but do perform a specialized form of summarization with the help of a GNN. The models by  and LeClair et al. (2020) both perform code summarization, that is they generate a natural language description/summarization of code written in a programming language. They both utilize a GNN, and also both leverage the abstract syntax tree of the program given. Another interesting model is the model by Wu et al. (2019).

It prefers the most uncertain instances judged by the model outputs. For probabilistic models, entropy-based (Shannon, 1948), least-confidence (Culotta and McCallum, 2005) and margin-sampling (Scheffer et al., 2001;Schein and Ungar, 2007) are three typical uncertainty sampling strategies (Settles, 2009).

Another way to measure output uncertainty is to check the divergence of a model's predictions with respect to an instance's local region. If an instance is near the decision boundary, the model's outputs may be different within its local region.

Ideally, the selected instances should be the ones that most reduce future errors if labeled and added to the training set. This motivates the expected error reduction strategy (Roy and McCallum, 2001), which chooses instances that lead to the least expected error if added to retrain a model. This strategy can be computationally costly since retraining is needed for each candidate.

Recently, methods have been proposed to learn another model to select instances that lead to the fewest errors, usually measured on a held-out development set. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning have been utilized to train such policy models (Bachman et al., 2017;Fang et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018a,b). This learning-to-select strategy may have some constraints. First, it requires labeled data (maybe from another domain) to train the policy. To mitigate this reliance, Vu et al. (2019) use the current task model as an imperfect annotator for AL simulations. Moreover, the learning signals may be unstable for complex tasks, as Koshorek et al. (2019) show for semantic tasks.

A similar and simpler idea is to select the most erroneous or ambiguous instances with regard to the current task model, which can also be done with another performance-prediction model.

There are several strategies to naturally integrate multiple criteria. Examples include (uncertainty) weighted clustering (Zhdanov, 2019), diverse gradient selection (Ash et al., 2020;Kim, 2020) where the gradients themselves contain uncertainty information ( §2.1.3) and determinantal point processes (DPP) with quality-diversity decomposition .

Instead of statically merging into one query strategy, dynamic combination may better fit the AL learning process, since different strategies may excel at different AL phases.

For this purpose, a stopping criterion is needed, which checks certain metrics satisfying certain conditions. There can be simple heuristics. For example, AL can be stopped when all unlabeled instances are no closer than any of the support vectors with an SVM (Schohn and Cohn, 2000;Ertekin et al., 2007) or no new n-grams remain in the unlabeled set for MT (Bloodgood and Callison-Burch, 2010). Nevertheless, these are specific to the underlying models or target tasks. For the design of a general stopping criterion, there are three main aspects to consider: metric, dataset and condition.

For the metric, measuring performance on a development set seems a natural option. However, the results would be unstable if this set is too small and it would be impractical to assume a large development set. Cross-validation on the training set also has problems since the labeled data by AL is usually biased. In this case, metrics from the query strategies can be utilized. Examples include uncertainty or confidence (Zhu and Hovy, 2007;Vlachos, 2008), disagreement (Tomanek et al., 2007;Olsson and Tomanek, 2009), estimated performance (Laws and Schütze, 2008), expected error (Zhu et al., 2008a), confidence variation (Ghayoomi, 2010), as well as actual performance on the selected instances (Zhu and Hovy, 2007). Moreover, comparing the predictions between consecutive AL iterations is another reasonable option (Zhu et al., 2008b;Bloodgood and Vijay-Shanker, 2009a).

The dataset to calculate the stopping metric requires careful choosing. The results could be unstable if not adopting a proper set . Many works suggest that a separate unlabeled dataset should be utilized Vlachos, 2008;Bloodgood and Vijay-Shanker, 2009a;Beatty et al., 2019;Kurlandski and Bloodgood, 2022). Since the stopping metrics usually do not rely on gold labels, this dataset could potentially be very large to provide more stable results, though wait time would be another factor to consider in this case ( §3.2.4).

The condition to stop AL is usually comparing the metrics to a pre-defined threshold. Earlier works only look at the metric at the current iteration, for example, stopping if the uncertainty or the error is less than the threshold (Zhu and Hovy, 2007). In this case, the threshold is hard to specify since it relies on the model and the task. (Zhu et al., 2008b) cascade multiple stopping criteria to mitigate this reliance. A more stable option is to track the change of the metrics over several AL iterations, such as stopping when the confidence consistently drops (Vlachos, 2008), the changing rate flattens (Laws and Schütze, 2008) or the predictions stabilize across iterations (Bloodgood and Vijay-Shanker, 2009a;Bloodgood and Grothendieck, 2013). Pullar-Strecker et al. (2021) provide an empirical comparison over common stopping criteria and would be a nice reference. Moreover, stopping AL can be closely related to performance prediction and early stopping. Especially, the latter can be of particular interest to AL since learning in early AL stages need to face the low-resource problem and how to perform early stopping may also require careful considerations.

Nevertheless, considering that the output space is usually exponentially large and infeasible to explicitly enumerate, querying may require further inspection.

Some uncertainty sampling strategies, such as entropy, need to consider the full output space. Instead of the infeasible explicit enumeration, dynamic-programming algorithms that are similar to the ones in decoding and inference processes can be utilized, such as algorithms for tree-entropy (Hwa, 2000(Hwa, , 2004 and sequence-entropy (Mann and McCallum, 2007;. Instead of considering the full output space, topk approximation is a simpler alternative that takes k-best predicted structures as a proxy. This is also a frequently utilized method Kim et al., 2006;Rocha and Sanchez, 2013).

For disagreement-based strategies, the measurement of partial disagreement may be required, since full-match can be too strict for structured objects. Fine-grained evaluation scores can be reasonable choices for this purpose, such as F1 score for sequence labeling (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000).

Since longer instances usually have larger uncertainties and might be preferred, length normalization is a commonly-used heuristic to avoid this bias Hwa, 2000Hwa, , 2004). Yet,  argue that longer sequences should not be discouraged and may contain more information.

For example, in a dependency tree, functional relations are usually easier to judge while prepositional attachment links may be more informative for the learning purpose. This naturally leads to AL with partial structures, where querying and annotating can be performed at the sub-structure level.

Factorizing full structures into the finestgrained sub-structures and regarding them as the annotation units could be a natural choice. Typical examples include individual tokens for sequence labeling , word boundaries for segmentation (Neubig et al., 2011;Li et al., 2012b), syntactic-unit pairs for dependency parsing (Sassano and Kurohashi, 2010) and mention pairs for coreference (Gasperin, 2009;Miller et al., 2012;Sachan et al., 2015). The querying strategy for the sub-structures can be similar to the classification cases, though inferences are usually needed to calculate marginal probabilities. Moreover, if full structures are desired as annotation outputs, semi-supervised techniques such as self-training ( §4.2) could be utilized to assign pseudo labels to the unannotated parts Majidi and Crane, 2013).

At many times, choosing larger sub-structures is preferable, since partial annotation still needs the understanding of larger contexts and frequently jumping among different contexts may require more reading time ( §3.2.1). Moreover, increasing the sampling granularity may mitigate the missed class effect, where certain classes may be overlooked . Typical examples of larger sub-structures include sub-sequences for sequence labeling Chaudhary et al., 2019;, word-wise head edges for dependency parsing (Flannery and Mori, 2015;Li et al., 2016), neighborhood pools (Laws et al., 2012) or mention-wise anaphoric links Espeland et al., 2020) for coreference, and phrases for MT (Bloodgood and Callison-Burch, 2010;Miura et al., 2016;Hu and Neubig, 2021). In addition to increasing granularity, grouping queries can also help to make annotation easier, such as adopting a two-stage selection of choosing uncertain tokens from uncertain sentences (Mirroshandel and Nasr, 2011;Flannery and Mori, 2015) and selecting nearby instances in a row (Miller et al., 2012).

For AL with partial structures, output modeling is of particular interest since the model needs to learn from partial annotations. If directly using local discriminative models where each substructure is decided independently, learning with partial annotations is straightforward since the annotations are already complete to the models (Neubig et al., 2011;Flannery and Mori, 2015). For more complex models that consider interactions among output sub-structures, such as global models, special algorithms are required to learn from incomplete annotations (Scheffer et al., 2001;Wanvarie et al., 2011;Li et al., 2016). One advantage of these more complex models is the interaction of the partial labels and the remaining parts. For example, considering the output constraints for structured prediction tasks, combining the annotated parts and the constraints may reduce the output space of other parts and thus lower their uncertainties, leading to better queries (Roth and Small, 2006;Sassano and Kurohashi, 2010;Mirroshandel and Nasr, 2011). More generally, the annotation of one label can intermediately influence others with cheap re-inference, which can help batch-mode selection (Marcheggiani and Artières, 2014) and interactive correction (Culotta and McCallum, 2005).

In addition to classical structured-prediction tasks, classification tasks can also be cast as structured predictions with partial labeling. Partial feedback is an example that is adopted to make the annotating of classification tasks simpler, especially when there are a large number of target labels. For example, annotators may find it much easier to answer yes/no questions (Hu et al., 2019) or rule out negative classes (Lippincott and Van Durme, 2021) than to identify the correct one.","[[], [None, 'b100', 'b101', 'b91'], ['b91', 'b106', 'b101', 'b109', 'b95', None, 'b100'], ['b10', 'b56', 'b91', 'b95', None], []]","[[], [None, 'b100', 'b101', 'b91'], ['b91', 'b106', 'b101', 'b109', 'b95', None, 'b100'], ['b10', 'b56', 'b91', 'b95', None], []]",16,"sent1: A structured object can be decomposed into smaller sub-structures with different training utilities.

Semi-supervised learning. Since AL usually assumes an unlabeled pool, semi-supervised learning can be a natural fit. Combining these two is not a new idea: (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) adopt the EM algorithm to estimate the outputs of unlabeled data and utilize them for learning. This type of self-training or pseudo-labeling technique is often utilized in AL Majidi and Crane, 2013;Yu et al., 2022). With a similar motivation, (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009) use an unsupervised algorithm to identify the unambiguous instances to train an active learner. For the task of word alignment, which can be learned in an unsupervised manner, incorporating supervision with AL can bring further improvements in a data-efficient way (Ambati et al., 2010b,c).

Transfer learning. AL can be easily combined with transfer learning, another technique to reduce required annotations. Utilizing pre-trained models is already a good example (Ein-Dor et al., 2020;Tamkin et al., 2022) and continual training (Gururangan et al., 2020) can also be applied (Hua and Wang, 2022;Margatina et al., 2022). Moreover, transductive learning is commonly combined with AL by transferring learning signals from different domains (Chan and Ng, 2007;Shi et al., 2008;Rai et al., 2010;Saha et al., 2011;Wu et al., 2017;Kasai et al., 2019; or languages (Qian et al., 2014;Fang and Cohn, 2017;Fang et al., 2017;Chaudhary et al., 2019Moniz et al., 2022). In addition to the task model, the model-based query policy ( §2.1.4) is also often obtained with transfer learning.

Weak supervision. AL can also be combined with weakly supervised learning. Examples include learning from inputs and execution results for semantic parsing (Ni et al., 2020), labeling based on identical structure vectors for entity representations (Qian et al., 2020), learning from gazetteers and dictionaries for sequence labeling  and interactively discovering labeling rules .

Data augmentation. Augmentation is also applicable in AL and has been explored with iterative back-translation , mixup for sequence labeling  and phraseto-sentence augmentation for MT (Hu and Neubig, 2021). As discussed in §2.1.1, augmentation can also be helpful for instance querying (Jiang et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2022b). Another interesting scenario involving augmentation and AL is query synthesis, which directly generates instances to be annotated instead of selecting existing unlabeled ones. Though synthesizing texts is still a hard problem generally, there have been successful applications for simple classification tasks (Schumann and Rehbein, 2019;Quteineh et al., 2020).","[[], [None, 'b63'], ['b32', 'b91', None, 'b57', 'b67', 'b2', 'b39'], ['b112'], ['b15', None, 'b72', 'b0']]","[[], [None, 'b63'], ['b32', 'b91', None, 'b57', 'b67', 'b2', 'b39'], ['b112'], ['b15', None, 'b72', 'b0']]",14,"sent1: AL can be combined with other advanced learning techniques to further reduce required annotations.
sent2: Semi-supervised learning. Since AL usually assumes an unlabeled pool, semi-supervised learning can be a natural fit.
sent3: Combining these two is not a new idea: (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) adopt the EM algorithm to estimate the outputs of unlabeled data and utilize them for learning.
sent4: This type of self-training or pseudo-labeling technique is often utilized in AL Majidi and Crane, 2013;Yu et al., 2022).
sent5: With a similar motivation, (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009) use an unsupervised algorithm to identify the unambiguous instances to train an active learner.
sent6: For the task of word alignment, which can be learned in an unsupervised manner, incorporating supervision with AL can bring further improvements in a data-efficient way (Ambati et al., 2010b,c).
sent7: Transfer learning. AL can be easily combined with transfer learning, another technique to reduce required annotations.
sent8: Utilizing pre-trained models is already a good example (Ein-Dor et al., 2020;Tamkin et al., 2022) and continual training (Gururangan et al., 2020) can also be applied (Hua and Wang, 2022;Margatina et al., 2022).
sent9: Moreover, transductive learning is commonly combined with AL by transferring learning signals from different domains (Chan and Ng, 2007;Shi et al., 2008;Rai et al., 2010;Saha et al., 2011;Wu et al., 2017;Kasai et al., 2019; or languages (Qian et al., 2014;Fang and Cohn, 2017;Fang et al., 2017;Chaudhary et al., 2019Moniz et al., 2022).
sent10: In addition to the task model, the model-based query policy ( §2.1.4) is also often obtained with transfer learning.
sent11: Weak supervision. AL can also be combined with weakly supervised learning.
sent12: Examples include learning from inputs and execution results for semantic parsing (Ni et al., 2020), labeling based on identical structure vectors for entity representations (Qian et al., 2020), learning from gazetteers and dictionaries for sequence labeling  and interactively discovering labeling rules .

This wait time may bring some hidden costs, thus more efficient querying and training would be preferable for faster turnarounds.

To speed up querying, sub-sampling is a simple method to deal with large unlabeled pools (Roy and McCallum, 2001;Ertekin et al., 2007;Tsvigun et al., 2022). For some querying strategies, precalculating and caching unchanging information can also help to speed up (Ashrafi Asli et al., 2020;Citovsky et al., 2021). In addition, approximation with k-nearest neighbours can also be utilized to calculate density (Zhu et al., 2009) or search for instances after adversarial attacks (Ru et al., 2020).

To reduce training time, a seemingly reasonable strategy is to apply incremental training across AL iterations, that is, continuing training previous models on the new instances. However, Ash and Adams (2020) show that this type of warm-start may lead to sub-optimal performance for neural models and many recent AL works usually train models from scratch (Hu et al., 2019;Ein-Dor et al., 2020). Another method is to use an efficient model for querying and a more powerful model for final training. However, this might lead to sub-optimal results, which will be discussed in §4.1.

Another idea to reduce wait time is to simply allow querying with stale information. Actually, batch-mode AL ( §2.2.3) is such an example where instances in the same batch are queried with the same model. Haertel et al.

In AL, models and annotators usually interact in an indirect way where models only query the instances to present to the annotators, while there could be closer interactions.

Pre-annotation is such an idea, where not only the raw data instances but also the model's best or top-k predictions are sent to the annotators to help them make decisions. If the model's predictions are reasonable, the annotators can simply select or make a few corrections to obtain the gold annotations rather than creating from scratch. This method has been shown effective when combined with AL (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004;Vlachos, 2006;Ringger et al., 2008;Skeppstedt, 2013;Cañizares-Díaz et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, the annotation efforts for different instances may vary . For example, longer sentences may cost more to annotate than shorter ones. Because of this, many works assume unit costs to tokens instead of sequences, which may still be inaccurate. Especially, AL tends to select difficult and ambiguous instances, which may require more annotation efforts (Hachey et al., 2005;Lynn et al., 2012). It is important to properly measure annotation cost since the measurement directly affects the evaluation of AL algorithms. The comparisons of query strategies may vary if adopting different cost measurement (Haertel et al., 2008a;Bloodgood and Callison-Burch, 2010;Chen et al., 2015).

Probably the best cost measurement is the actual annotation time (Baldridge and Palmer, 2009).

This requires actual annotating exercises rather than simulations.

Since cost measurement can also be used for querying ( §3.2.2), it would be helpful to be able to predict the real cost before annotating.

To select a batch of diverse instances, there are two common approaches. 1) Iterative selection collects the batch in an iterative greedy way (Brinker, 2003;.

In this section, we describe the tasks and define their input and output. While they all consume tables, settings can be quite heterogeneous, with systems exploiting different information, even for the same task. A summary of the covered tasks along their input, output, and some representative systems addressing them is shown in Table 4. We detail next the mandatory input elements and the different contexts.  (Dagan et al., 2013;Korman et al., 2018), checking facts with tables consists of verifying if a textual input claim is true or false against a trusted database (TAPEX, DECO, TABFACT), also provided as input. Some fact-checking systems, such as FEVEROUS, also output the cells used for verification as evidence (Nakov et al., 2021;Karagiannis et al., 2020).

Question Answering (QA): In the free text setting, QA aims at retrieving passages that include the answer to a given question. In the tabular data setting, it consists of returning as output the cells that answer an input consisting of a question and a table. One can distinguish two levels of complexity. Simple QA involves lookup queries on tables (DTR, CLTR), while a more complex QA  Most of the systems in this survey aim at improving accuracy in QA with respect to hand-crafted embeddings.

Semantic Parsing (SP): In the tabular data setting, given a question and a table as input, SP generates a declarative query in SQL over the table's schema to retrieve the answer to the question. While in QA the interest is in directly getting the answer, SP produces the (interpretable) query to obtain it (TABERT, GRAPPA, TAPEX).  table that can be used to answer the question. TR is helpful when trying to reduce the search space for a QA task (GTR, DTR, MMR). It is a challenging task given the limited input size of transformers, that is, their constraint to sequences of 512 tokens.  We observe that most tasks can be seen as traditional NLP problems where structured data replace free text, such as the case of QA where answers are located in tabular data instead of documents (Gupta and Gupta, 2012). TFC involves retrieving cells that entail or refute a given statement, whereas on free text the corresponding objective is to select sentences as evidence (Thorne et al., 2018). SP is the task of converting natural language utterance into a logical form (Berant and Liang, 2014), which in this setting is expressed as a declarative query over a relational table. TR on tabular data corresponds to passage retrieval on free text (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997). TCP is analogous to predicting missing words or values in a sentence . Finally, TMP can be related to syntactic parsing in NLP (Van Gompel and Pickering, 2007), where relationships between different tokens are depicted.

We conclude this section with an analysis of the performance of the systems over the different downstream tasks. For every task, we selected datasets for which at least two systems have reported results. All datasets reported in Table 5 (Ghasemi-Gol and Szekely, 2018), which contains web tables annotated with their type (relational, entity, matrix, list, and non-data), and EntiTab (Zhang and Balog, 2017), which contains web tables annotated with possible header labels for the column population task. Table 5 also contains the size, expressed as number of parameters, of the largest model used by every system. As some systems are not comparable on any shared datasets, we report here their size: TABFACT (110M), MMR (87M), TURL (314M), RPT (139M), and CLTR (235M). Larger models do not correlate with better performance across different systems for the same task, but a larger model always brings higher scores for the same system, as expected. Execution times for training and testing depend on the size of the model and the computing architecture.

The results in the table show that some tasks, such as TFC and TMP, can already be handled successfully by the systems, while some tasks, such as TCP, TR, and SP, are harder. QA is the task supported by most systems and the quality of the results vary depending on the dataset at hand. Differences in performance can be explained with different improvements across the systems. For example, MATE has better performance with respect to TAPAS in two tasks because of its mechanism to deal with larger input tables. Similarly, TUTA improves over TABERT because it handles tabular data beyond relational tables. Finally, TABERT and TAPAS are the systems that show most coverage in terms of tasks, with multiple papers using them as baselines in their experiments. For the systems that are not reported in Table 5, we notice that TURL obtains similar F1 results for column type prediction, but on a dataset different from VizNet; TURL, TABBIE, and TABERT also report comparable MAP results for the row population task (not in Table 5) over different datasets.","[['b61', 'b72', 'b54', 'b30'], [], ['b10', 'b55', 'b93', 'b96', 'b47'], ['b42', 'b111'], []]","[['b61', 'b72', 'b54', 'b30'], [], ['b10', 'b55', 'b93', 'b96', 'b47'], ['b42', 'b111'], []]",11,"sent1: Using neural representations for tabular data show, improvements in performance in several downstream tasks.

sent14: TR is helpful when trying to reduce the search space for a QA task (GTR, DTR, MMR).
sent15: It is a challenging task given the limited input size of transformers, that is, their constraint to sequences of 512 tokens.
sent16: We observe that most tasks can be seen as traditional NLP problems where structured data replace free text, such as the case of QA where answers are located in tabular data instead of documents (Gupta and Gupta, 2012).
sent17: TFC involves retrieving cells that entail or refute a given statement, whereas on free text the corresponding objective is to select sentences as evidence (Thorne et al., 2018).
sent18: SP is the task of converting natural language utterance into a logical form (Berant and Liang, 2014), which in this setting is expressed as a declarative query over a relational table.
sent19: TR on tabular data corresponds to passage retrieval on free text (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997).
sent20: TCP is analogous to predicting missing words or values in a sentence .
sent21: Finally, TMP can be related to syntactic parsing in NLP (Van Gompel and Pickering, 2007), where relationships between different tokens are depicted.
sent22: We conclude this section with an analysis of the performance of the systems over the different downstream tasks.
sent23: For every task, we selected datasets for which at least two systems have reported results.
sent24: All datasets reported in Table 5 (Ghasemi-Gol and Szekely, 2018), which contains web tables annotated with their type (relational, entity, matrix, list, and non-data), and EntiTab (Zhang and Balog, 2017), which contains web tables annotated with possible header labels for the column population task.
sent25: Table 5 also contains the size, expressed as number of parameters, of the largest model used by every system.
sent26: As some systems are not comparable on any shared datasets, we report here their size: TABFACT (110M), MMR (87M), TURL (314M), RPT (139M), and CLTR (235M).
sent27: Larger models do not correlate with better performance across different systems for the same task, but a larger model always brings higher scores for the same system, as expected.
sent28: Execution times for training and testing depend on the size of the model and the computing architecture.
sent29: The results in the table show that some tasks, such as TFC and TMP, can already be handled successfully by the systems, while some tasks, such as TCP, TR, and SP, are harder.
sent30: QA is the task supported by most systems and the quality of the results vary depending on the dataset at hand.
sent31: Differences in performance can be explained with different improvements across the systems.
sent32: For example, MATE has better performance with respect to TAPAS in two tasks because of its mechanism to deal with larger input tables.
sent33: Similarly, TUTA improves over TABERT because it handles tabular data beyond relational tables.
sent34: Finally, TABERT and TAPAS are the systems that show most coverage in terms of tasks, with multiple papers using them as baselines in their experiments.
sent35: For the systems that are not reported in Table 5, we notice that TURL obtains similar F1 results for column type prediction, but on a dataset different from VizNet; TURL, TABBIE, and TABERT also report comparable MAP results for the row population task (not in Table 5) over different datasets."

In contrast, the statistical and rule-based approaches are diminishing. Compared to ISCA, we see more adaptation of the pre-training model. This is because ACL work is more text-based focused, where pre-trained LMs are more widely available.

Neural-Based Models Figure 5 shows that the trend of using neural-based models started in 2013, and the usage of rule/linguistic constraint and statistical methods diminished gradually through time, but they are still used even with a low percentage. RNN and LSTM architectures are commonly used in sequence modeling, such as language modeling (Adel et al., 2013;Vu and Schultz, 2014;Adel et al., 2014c;Winata et al., 2018a;Garg et al., 2018a;Winata et al., 2019c) and CSW identification (Samih et al., 2016a). DNN-based and hybrid HMM-DNN models are used in speech recognition models .

Pre-trained Embeddings Pre-trained embeddings are used to complement neural-based approaches by initializing the embedding layer. Common pre-trained embeddings used in the literature are monolingual subword-based embeddings, Fast-Text (Joulin et al., 2016), and aligned-embeddings MUSE (Conneau et al., 2017). A standard method to utilize monolingual embeddings is to concatenate or sum two or more embeddings from different languages (Trivedi et al., 2018). A more recent approach is to apply an attention mechanism to merge embeddings and form metaembeddings (Winata et al., 2019a,b). Characterbased embeddings have also been explored in the literature to address the out-of-vocabulary issues on word-embeddings (Winata et al., 2018b;Attia et al., 2018;Aguilar et al., 2021). Another approach is to train bilingual embeddings using real and synthetic CSW data (Pratapa et al., 2018b). In the speech domain, Lovenia et al. (2022) utilize wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) as a starting model before fine-tuning.

Language Models Many pre-trained model approaches utilize multilingual LMs, such as mBERT or XLM-R to deal with CSW data (Khanuja et al., 2020b;Aguilar and Solorio, 2020;Pant and Dadu, 2020;Patwa et al., 2020;Winata et al., 2021a). These models are often fine-tuned with the downstream task or with CSW text to better adapt to the languages. Some downstream fine-tuning approaches use synthetic CSW data due to a lack of available datasets. Aguilar et al. (2021) propose a character-based subword module (char2subword) of the mBERT that learns the subword embedding that is suitable for modeling the noisy CSW text. Winata et al. (2021a) compare the performance of the multilingual LM versus the language-specific LM for CSW context. While XLM-R provides the best result, it is also computationally heavy. There needed to be more exploration of larger models. We see that pre-trained LMs provide better empirical results on current benchmark tasks and enables an end-to-end approach. Therefore, one can theoretically work on CSW tasks without any linguistic understanding of the language, assuming the dataset for model finetuning is available.

Kennedy,"Negotiation is one of the crucial abilities in human communication that involves two or more individuals discussing goals and tactics to resolve conflicts, achieve mutual benefit, or find mutually acceptable solutions (Fershtman, 1990;Bazerman and Neale, 1993;Lewicki et al., 2011). It is a common aspect of human interaction, occurring whenever people communicate in order to manage conflict or reach a compromise. Scientifically, one of the long-term goals of dialogue research is to empower intelligent agents with such ability. Agent effectively negotiating with a human in natural language could have significant benefits in many scenarios, from bargaining prices in everyday trade-in (He et al., 2018) to high-stakes political or legal situations (Basave and He, 2016). Negotiation dialogue systems (Lewandowska, 1982;Lambert and Carberry, 1992;Chawla et al., 2021c) is an emerging research field that aims to build intelligent conversational agents that can automatically negotiate with a human in natural languages, e.g., CICERO 1 from Meta AI. Agents negotiate with human through multi-turn interaction using logically reasoning (Sycara and Dai, 2010) over goals (Zhang et al., 2020), strategies (Zhou et al., 2020) and psychology factors (Yang et al., 2021). As illustrated in Figure 1, negotiation dialogue agents interact with the human through multiturn cycles. A successful negotiation process involves efficient information exchange, strategic discussion toward their goals, and a closing section.

Despite the significant amount of research that has been conducted on the task, there is a lack of a systematic review of the topic. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by reviewing contemporary work in the emerging field of negotiation dialogue systems, covering aspects such as benchmarks, evaluation, methodology, and future directions. In recent years, various benchmarks have been proposed for negotiation dialogue systems, ranging from bargaining (Lewis et al., 2017) and game scenarios (Asher et al., 2016) to job interviews  and items exchanging (Chawla et al., 2021c). Our survey will provide an overview of these benchmarks and discuss how they have been used to evaluate the performance of negotiation dialogue systems.

Modeling the negotiation process for conversational agents also imposes challenges. Firstly, these agents must be able to reason about and employ various strategies in different situations. In addition to strategy modeling, it is also necessary to model the personalities (e.g., mind, emotion, and behaviors) of the negotiators. Thirdly, an effective policy learning method is essential for the successful use of language. To address these challenges, we can categorize existing solutions into three areas: (1) Personality modeling helps us understand negotiator's preferences, (2) Strategy modeling enables agents to make reasonable decisions based on gathered information, and (3) Policy learning methods utilize information effectively to maximize results.

Negotiation is used to manage conflict and is the primary give-and-take process by which people try to reach an agreement (Fisher et al., 2011;Lewicki et al., 2011). Research on negotiation has been conducted for almost 60 years in the field of psychology, political science, and communication. It has evolved over the past decades from exploring game theory (Walton and McKersie, 1991), behavior decisions driven by the cognitive revolution in psychology (Bazerman and Neale, 1993), to cultural differences in the 2000s (Bazerman et al., 2000). Negotiation research, however, is now forced to confront the implications of human/AI collaborations given recent advancements in machine learning (Sycara and Dai, 2010). Converging efforts from social scientists and data scientists who incorporate insights from both fields will be fruitful in maximizing expectations and outcomes during negotiation processes.

Negotiation is a process by which two or more parties attempt to resolve their opposing interests. Strategy of negotiation can be distributive, such as bargaining (Fershtman, 1990) and integrative, such as maximizing unilateral interests (Bazerman and Neale, 1993), both of which are used in various social situations such as informal, peer to peer, organizational, and diplomatic country to country settings. The implications for enhancing outcomes are thus large and important to understand. Research from psychology demonstrates that the negotiation process can be affected by psychological factors, such as personality (Sharma et al., 2013), relationship (Olekalns and Smith, 2003), social status (Blader and Chen, 2012), and cultural background (Leung and Cohen, 2011).","[['b51', 'b4', 'b3', 'b18', 'b47', 'b33'], ['b42', 'b17', 'b4', 'b43']]","[['b51', 'b4', 'b3', 'b18', 'b47', 'b33'], ['b42', 'b17', 'b4', 'b43']]",10,"sent1: Humans negotiate everyday in their daily routines.

To achieve optimal negotiation goals, the involved players should make trade-offs for multiple issues.

Multi-player Strategy Games The strategy video games provide ideal platforms for people to verbally communicate with other players to accomplish their missions and goals. Asher et al. (2016) propose the STAC benchmark, which is the player dialogue in the game of Catan. In this game, players need to gather resources, including wood, wheat, sheep, and more, with each other to purchase settlements, roads and cities. As each player only has access to their own resources, they have to communicate with each other. To investigate the linguistic strategies used in this situation, STAC also includes an SDRT-styled discourse structure. Boritchev and Amblard (2022) also collect a DinG dataset from French-speaking players in this game. The participants are instructed to focus on the game, rather than talk about themselves. As a result, the collected dialogues can better reflect the negotiation strategy used in the game process.

Negotiation for Item Assignment The item assignment scenarios involve a fixed set of items as well as a predefined priority for each player in the dialogue. As the players only have access to their own priority, they need to negotiate with each other to exchange the items they prefer. Nouri and Traum (2014) propose InitiativeTalking, occurring between the owners of two restaurants. They discuss how to distribute the fruits (i.e., apples, bananas, and strawberries) and try to reach an agreement. Lewis et al. (2017) propose DealorNoDeal, a similar two-party negotiation dialogue benchmark where both participants are only shown their own sets of items with a value for each and both of them are asked to maximize their total score after negotiation. Chawla et al. (2021c) propose CaSiNo, a dataset on campsite scenarios involving campsite neighbors negotiating for additional food, water, and firewood packages. Both parties have different priorities over different items.

Negotiation for Job Interview Another commonly encountered negotiation scenario is job offer negotiation with recruiters. Yamaguchi et al. (2021a) fill this gap and propose the JobInterview dataset.

English and Heeman (2005) are the first to use RL techniques for negotiation dialogue systems. They employed a single-agent pattern to learn the policy of two opponents individually. But singleagent RL techniques are not well suited for concurrent learning where each agent is trained against a continuously changing environment. Therefore, Georgila et al.

Most recent works try to equip RL with deep learning techniques. For instance, Zhang et al. (2020) propose OPPA, which lets the target agent behave given the system actions.

In such negotiation, the involved people normally talk about a single issue (e.g., item price) and therefore, there are hardly trade-offs between multiple issues in such negotiation.

Persuasion For Donation Persuasion, convincing others to take specific actions, is a necessary required skill for negotiation dialogue (Sycara, 1990;Sierra et al., 1997). Wang et al. (2019) focus on persuasion and propose PersuasionforGood, a twoparty persuasion conversations about charity donations. In the data annotation process, the persuaders are provided some persuasion tips and example sentences, while the persuaders are only told that this conversation is about charity. The annotators are required to complete at least ten utterances in a dialogue and are encouraged to reach an agreement at the end of the conversations. Dutt et al. (2020) further extend PersuasionforGood by adding the utterance-level annotations that change the positive and/or the negative face of the participants in a conversation.

sent13: The standard practice for deep learning techniques is to treat numbers in the same way as words.
sent14: Early neural network methods create a vocabulary that maps input words and numbers to token IDs, resulting in less frequent numbers being collapsed into an ""UNK"" token.
sent15: Recent language models use subword tokenization techniques (Wu et al., 2016;Sennrich et al., 2016) to split numbers into atomic tokens.
sent16: Recent studies have shown that these tokenization approaches are suboptimal (Wallace et al., 2019;Lin et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020d;Thawani et al., 2022).
sent17: Two numbers on the same or close number line could have surface forms with no shared common tokens.
sent18: For example, a number like 1598 is tokenized as ""15"" and ""98"" in GPT-3, while another format like 1, 598 is split as three different tokens: ""1"", "","", and ""598"".
sent19: This lack of consistent representation can make it difficult for deep learning models to effectively process numbers, especially when compared to pure text.
sent20: The insufficient representations of numbers can lead to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.

In-context Learning (ICL) enables LLMs to perform target tasks by providing some task examples as conditions at inference time, without updating model parameters (Radford et al., 2020;Brown et al., 2020). ICL allows users to quickly build models for new use cases without worrying about fine-tuning and storing a large amount of new parameters for each task, so it is widely used in fewshot settings nowadays (Min et al., 2022). An in-context example typically contains an input-output pair with some prompt words, e.g., Please select the largest number from the list. Input: [2,4,1,5,8]. Output: 8, and few-shot works by giving multiple examples, and then a final input example, where the model is expected to predict the output. However, such standard few-shot promptings, in which the LLM is given in-context examples of input-output pairs in front of test-time examples, have not yet proved sufficient to achieve high performance on challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning (Rae et al., 2021).

Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) leverages intermediate natural language rationales as prompts to enable LLMs to first generate reasoning chains and then predict an answer for an input question. For example, a CoT prompt for solving the math word problem could be Question: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. Then, how many tennis balls does Roger have now? Answer: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

Apart from Kojima et al.

Are deep learning methods consistent for mathematical reasoning? Recent developments in deep learning have led to impressive results on various mathematical reasoning tasks.

A math word problem (also termed an algebraic or arithmetic word problem) describes a brief narrative that involves characters, entities, and quantities. The mathematical relationship of an MWP can be modeled with a set of equations whose solution reveals the final answer to the question. A typical example is shown in Table 1. A question involves the four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with single or multiple operation steps. The challenge of MWPs for NLP systems lies in the need for language comprehension, semantic parsing, and multiple mathematical reasoning skills.

Existing MWP datasets cover grade school problems, which are crawled from online learning websites (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2015), collected from textbooks, or manually annotated by human workers (Patel et al., 2021). Early math word problem datasets are relatively small or limited to a small number of operation steps (Hosseini et al., 2014;Kushman et al., 2014;Roy et al., 2015). Some recently curated datasets aim to increase problem diversity and difficulty levels. For example, Ape210K (Zhao et al., 2020) consists of 210k elementary math word problems, which is the largest publicly available. The problems in GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) can involve up to 8 steps to solve. SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) is a benchmark that tests the robustness of deep learning models to math word problems with simple variations. More recently built datasets involve modalities beyond text. For example, IconQA (Lu et al., 2021b) provides an abstract diagram as a visual context, while TabMWP (Lu et al., 2022b) provides a tabular context for each problem.

Most MWP datasets provide annotated equations as a rationale for the solution (e.g., Table 1). To improve the performance and interpretability of the learned solvers, MathQA (Tafjord et al., 2019) is annotated with precise operation programs, and MathQA-Python (Austin et al., 2021) is provided with specific Python programs instead. Another line of datasets annotates the problems with multistep natural language solutions that are regarded as more human-readable (Ling et al., 2017;Cobbe et al., 2021;Lu et al., 2022b). Lila (Mishra et al., 2022a) annotates many of the previously mentioned MWP datasets with Python program rationales.

The result is a sequence of steps that constitutes a verified proof.

Data sources for neural theorem proving in ITPs include interactive learning environments that interface with ITPs, and datasets derived from proofs in ITP libraries. For example, CoqGym (Yang and Deng, 2019) provides an interactive environment and 71K human-written proofs for the Coq ITP. For Isabelle, PISA (Jiang et al., 2021) enables interaction and provides a dataset of 183k proofs mined from the Isabelle standard library and Archive of Formal Proofs.

Li et al. construct IsarStep using the Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs, and propose a task of filling in a missing intermediate proposition. Early applications of deep learning for formal theorem proving focus on selecting relevant premises (Alemi et al., 2016).

Informal theorem proving presents an alternative medium for theorem proving, in which statements and proofs are written in the mixture of natural language and symbols used in ""standard"" mathematics (e.g., in L A T E X), and are checked for correctness by humans. Early work focuses on selecting relevant premises (Ferreira and Freitas, 2020b,a). Welleck et al. (2021) develop NaturalProofs, a large-scale dataset of 32k informal mathematical theorems, definitions, and proofs, and provide a benchmark for premise selection via retrieval and generation tasks.

sent26: Early math word problem datasets are relatively small or limited to a small number of operation steps (Hosseini et al., 2014;Kushman et al., 2014;Roy et al., 2015).
sent27: Some recently curated datasets aim to increase problem diversity and difficulty levels.
sent28: For example, Ape210K (Zhao et al., 2020) consists of 210k elementary math word problems, which is the largest publicly available.
sent29: The problems in GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) can involve up to 8 steps to solve.
sent30: SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) is a benchmark that tests the robustness of deep learning models to math word problems with simple variations.
sent31: More recently built datasets involve modalities beyond text.
sent32: For example, IconQA (Lu et al., 2021b) provides an abstract diagram as a visual context, while TabMWP (Lu et al., 2022b) provides a tabular context for each problem.
sent33: Most MWP datasets provide annotated equations as a rationale for the solution (e.g., Table 1).
sent34: To improve the performance and interpretability of the learned solvers, MathQA (Tafjord et al., 2019) is annotated with precise operation programs, and MathQA-Python (Austin et al., 2021) is provided with specific Python programs instead.
sent35: Another line of datasets annotates the problems with multistep natural language solutions that are regarded as more human-readable (Ling et al., 2017;Cobbe et al., 2021;Lu et al., 2022b).
sent36: Lila (Mishra et al., 2022a) annotates many of the previously mentioned MWP datasets with Python program rationales."

Different from a math word problem, a geometry problem consists of a textual description in natural language and a geometric diagram. As shown in Figure 2, the multimodal inputs describe the entities, attributes, and relationships of geometric elements, and the goal is to find the numeric solution to an unknown variable. GPS is a challenging task for deep learning methods due to the complex skills it requires. It involves the ability to parse multimodal informa-tion, perform symbolic abstraction, utilize theorem knowledge, and conduct quantitative reasoning.

Some early datasets are proposed to facilitate research in this domain (Seo et al., 2015;Alvin et al., 2017;Sachan et al., 2017;Sachan and Xing, 2017). However, these datasets are relatively small or not publicly available, which limits the development of deep learning methods. In response to this limitation, Lu et al. create the Geometry3K dataset, which consists of 3,002 multi-choice geometry problems with unified logic form annotations for the multimodal inputs. More recently, largerscale datasets such as GeoQA (Chen et al., 2021a), GeoQA+ (Cao and Xiao, 2022), and UniGeo (Chen et al., 2022a) have been introduced and are annotated with programs that can be learned by neural solvers and executed to obtain the final answers.

Automated geometry problem solving (GPS) is also a long-standing AI task in mathematical reasoning research (Gelernter et al., 1960;Wen-Tsun, 1986;Chou et al., 1996;Ye et al., 2008) and has attracted much attention in recent years. Different from a math word problem, a geometry problem consists of a textual description in natural language and a geometric diagram. As shown in Figure 2, the multimodal inputs describe the entities, attributes, and relationships of geometric elements, and the goal is to find the numeric solution to an unknown variable. GPS is a challenging task for deep learning methods due to the complex skills it requires. It involves the ability to parse multimodal informa-tion, perform symbolic abstraction, utilize theorem knowledge, and conduct quantitative reasoning.

The result is a sequence of steps that constitutes a verified proof.

Data sources for neural theorem proving in ITPs include interactive learning environments that interface with ITPs, and datasets derived from proofs in ITP libraries. For example, CoqGym (Yang and Deng, 2019) provides an interactive environment and 71K human-written proofs for the Coq ITP. For Isabelle, PISA (Jiang et al., 2021) enables interaction and provides a dataset of 183k proofs mined from the Isabelle standard library and Archive of Formal Proofs. For Lean, LeanStep (Han et al., 2022) provides a dataset of proof-steps from Lean's mathematical library along with auxiliary tasks, while Lean-Gym (Polu et al., 2023) provides an interactive REPL. The miniF2F (Zheng et al., 2022) benchmark aims to provide a shared benchmark across ITPs, consisting of 488 problem statements sourced from mathematical competitions.

Other resources provide proxy environments or tasks. For example, INT (Wu et al., 2021c) provide a synthetic proving environment to measure six different types of generalization. Li et al. construct IsarStep using the Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs, and propose a task of filling in a missing intermediate proposition. Early applications of deep learning for formal theorem proving focus on selecting relevant premises (Alemi et al., 2016).

Informal theorem proving presents an alternative medium for theorem proving, in which statements and proofs are written in the mixture of natural language and symbols used in ""standard"" mathematics (e.g., in L A T E X), and are checked for correctness by humans. Early work focuses on selecting relevant premises (Ferreira and Freitas, 2020b,a). Welleck et al. (2021) develop NaturalProofs, a large-scale dataset of 32k informal mathematical theorems, definitions, and proofs, and provide a benchmark for premise selection via retrieval and generation tasks. Welleck et al. (2022a) adapt NaturalProofs for full proof generation, and provide a human evaluation protocol and proxy automatic metrics.

Are deep learning methods consistent for mathematical reasoning? Recent developments in deep learning have led to impressive results on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The zero-shot-CoT Minerva 540B achieves a score of 75.0% on the MMLU-STEM benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), which assesses multitask reasoning ability in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) at both high school and college levels.

In-context Learning (ICL) enables LLMs to perform target tasks by providing some task examples as conditions at inference time, without updating model parameters (Radford et al., 2020;Brown et al., 2020). ICL allows users to quickly build models for new use cases without worrying about fine-tuning and storing a large amount of new parameters for each task, so it is widely used in fewshot settings nowadays (Min et al., 2022). An in-context example typically contains an input-output pair with some prompt words, e.g., Please select the largest number from the list. Input: [2,4,1,5,8]. Output: 8, and few-shot works by giving multiple examples, and then a final input example, where the model is expected to predict the output. However, such standard few-shot promptings, in which the LLM is given in-context examples of input-output pairs in front of test-time examples, have not yet proved sufficient to achieve high performance on challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning (Rae et al., 2021).

Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) leverages intermediate natural language rationales as prompts to enable LLMs to first generate reasoning chains and then predict an answer for an input question. For example, a CoT prompt for solving the math word problem could be Question: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. Then, how many tennis balls does Roger have now? Answer: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

Apart from Kojima et al. (2022) showing that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners when given the ""Let's think step by step!"" prompt, most of the recent work has focused on how to improve chainof-thought reasoning under the few-shot setting. This work is mainly divided into two parts, (i) selecting better in-context examples and (ii) creating better reasoning chains.

Some work encodes the input text using a convolutional neural network architecture, giving the model the ability to capture long-term relationships between symbols in the input (Gehring et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018a,a;Robaidek et al., 2018;Alemi et al., 2016;Loos et al., 2017). For example, the first application of deep neural networks for theorem proving is proposed in (Alemi et al., 2016), which relies on convolutional networks for premise selection. Multimodal mathematical reasoning tasks, such as geometry problem solving and diagram-based mathematical reasoning, are formalized as visual question answer (VQA) problems (Kafle et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2021a;Lu et al., 2021b). In this domain, visual inputs are encoded using ResNet (He et al., 2016) or Faster- RCNN (Ren et al., 2015), while textual representations are obtained via GRU or LTSM. Subsequently, the joint representation is learned using multimodal fusion models, such as BAN (Kim et al., 2018), FiLM (Perez et al., 2018), and DAFA (Gao et al., 2019.

Other deep neural network structures can also be used in mathematical reasoning. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed for geometry problem parsing in , taking advantage of its success in spatial reasoning. WaveNet has been applied to theorem proving (Loos et al., 2017;Bansal et al., 2019), due to its ability to address longitudinal time-series data. Furthermore, Transformers are found to outperform GRU in generating mathematical equations in DDT (Meng and Rumshisky, 2019). Finally, MathDQN (Wang et al., 2018b) is the first work to explore reinforcement learning for math word problem solving, taking advantage of its strong search capabilities.

Deep learning approaches to mathematical reasoning tasks can also make use of other neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multimodal networks. Some work encodes the input text using a convolutional neural network architecture, giving the model the ability to capture long-term relationships between symbols in the input (Gehring et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018a,a;Robaidek et al., 2018;Alemi et al., 2016;Loos et al., 2017). For example, the first application of deep neural networks for theorem proving is proposed in (Alemi et al., 2016), which relies on convolutional networks for premise selection. Multimodal mathematical reasoning tasks, such as geometry problem solving and diagram-based mathematical reasoning, are formalized as visual question answer (VQA) problems (Kafle et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2021a;Lu et al., 2021b). In this domain, visual inputs are encoded using ResNet (He et al., 2016) or Faster- RCNN (Ren et al., 2015), while textual representations are obtained via GRU or LTSM. Subsequently, the joint representation is learned using multimodal fusion models, such as BAN (Kim et al., 2018), FiLM (Perez et al., 2018), and DAFA (Gao et al., 2019.

This has led many in the community to question whether AI systems can effectively perform quantitative reasoning in everyday scenarios. To this end, various benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the capabilities of AI systems in this area. Diagrams, such as figures, charts, and plots, are essential media that convey large amounts of information in a concise way. FigureQA (Kahou et al., 2018), DVQA (Kafle et al., 2018), MNS (Zhang et al., 2020c), PGDP5K (Hao et al., 2022), and GeoRE (Yu et al., 2021a), are released to investigate models' abilities to reason about quantitative relationships among entities grounded in diagrams. NumerSense (Lin et al., 2020), instead, examines whether and to what extent existing pre-trained language models can induce numerical commonsense knowledge. EQUATE (Ravichander et al., 2019) formalizes aspects of quantitative reasoning in a natural language inference framework.

Reasoning involves making inferences, evaluating arguments, and drawing logical conclusions based on available information. Although ""reasoning"" is a term that is commonly used in literature and daily life, it is also an abstract concept that can refer to many things. To help the reader better understand this concept, we summarize several main categories of reasoning that are commonly recognized:

Deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the truth of the premises. In deductive reasoning, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. For example:

• Premise: All mammals have kidneys. • Premise: All whales are mammals. • Conclusion: All whales have kidneys.

Inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on observations or evidence. The conclusion is likely to be true based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain. For example:

• Observation: Every time we see a creature with wings, it is a bird. • Observation: We see a creature with wings. • Conclusion: The creature is likely to be a bird.

Abductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the best explanation for a given set of observations. The conclusion is the most likely explanation based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain. For example:

• Observation: The car cannot start and there is a puddle of liquid under the engine. • Conclusion: The most likely explanation is that the car has a leak in the radiator.

Other types of reasoning include analogical reasoning, which involves making comparisons between two or more things in order to make inferences or arrive at conclusions; causal reasoning, which involves identifying and understanding the causes and effects of events or phenomena; and probabilistic reasoning, which involves making decisions or arriving at conclusions based on the likelihood or probability of certain outcomes.

Formal Reasoning vs Informal Reasoning. Formal reasoning is a systematic and logical process that follows a set of rules and principles, often used in mathematics and logic. Informal reasoning is a less structured approach that relies on intuition, experience, and common sense to draw conclusions and solve problems, and is often used in everyday life. Formal reasoning is more structured and reliable, while informal reasoning is more adaptable and open-ended, but may also be less reliable. We refer the reader to Galotti (1989); Bronkhorst et al. (2020) for a detailed distinction between them.

Reasoning in Language Models. The concept of reasoning in language models has been around for some time, but there is not a clear definition of what it entails. In the literature, the term ""reasoning"" is often used to refer to informal reasoning, although it is not always explicitly stated that it is informal (Cobbe et al., 2021;Wei et al., 2022b, inter alia). Different forms of reasoning may be used depending on the task, benchmark, or method being used, e.g., deductive reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021;Creswell et al., 2022;Han et al., 2022b, inter alia), inductive reasoning Misra et al., 2022, inter alia) or abductive reasoning (Wiegreffe et al., 2022;Lampinen et al., 2022;Jung et al., 2022, inter alia). In this paper, we encompass various forms of reasoning, with a particular focus on ""informal deductive reasoning"" in large language models since it is a widely used form in which the conclusion is guaranteed to be true as long as the premises are true.","[['b76', 'b75', None, 'b34'], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [None], [None, 'b80', 'b18']]","[['b76', 'b75', None, 'b34'], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [None], [None, 'b80', 'b18']]",8,"sent1: Reasoning is the process of thinking about something in a logical and systematic way, using evidence and past experiences to reach a conclusion or make a decision (Wason and Johnson-Laird, 1972;Wason, 1968;Galotti, 1989;Fagin et al., 2004;McHugh and Way, 2018).

Rationale refinement. The choice of exemplars can significantly affect the few-shot performance of LLMs, as demonstrated in research such as , which also appears in chain-of-thought prompting. Rationale refinement aims to create and refine rationale examples that are better able to elicit reasoning in LLMs. Fu et al. (2022b) propose complexity-based prompting to create rationales with more reasoning steps. Their experiments show that the performance of LLMs improves with the increased rationale complexity.

Rationale exploration. In addition to providing better exemplars, we can allow LLMs to fully explore various ways of reasoning to improve their performance on reasoning tasks, named rationale exploration. Based on the idea that complex problems often admit multiple ways of thinking that can lead to their unique correct answer, Wang et al. (2022c) present a decoding strategy called selfconsistency to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. This strategy involves sampling a diverse set of rationales, rather than just the greedy one, and selecting the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled rationales.

To further improve performance,  suggest providing different demonstrations for each question by sampling exemplars from an exemplar base, in order to increase the diversity of the sampled rationales.

Rationale verification. Ensuring that the rationales produced by LLMs are valid is critical, as incorrect rationales can lead to incorrect final predictions (Ye and Durrett, 2022). To address this issue, the process of rationale verification aims to verify whether the rationales produced by LLMs lead to the correct final answers. Cobbe et al.

Arithmetic Reasoning. Arithmetic reasoning is the ability to understand and apply mathematical concepts and principles in order to solve problems involving arithmetic operations. This involves using logical thinking and mathematical principles to determine the correct course of action when solving mathematical problems.

Reasoning seems an emergent ability of LLMs. Wei et al. (2022a,b);  show that reasoning ability appears to emerge only in large language models like GPT-3 175B, as evidenced by significant improvements in performance on reasoning tasks at a certain scale (e.g., 100 billion parameters). This suggests that it may be more effective to utilize large models for general reasoning problems rather than training small models for specific tasks. However, the reason for this emergent ability is not yet fully understood. We refer the reader to Wei et al. (2022a);Fu et al. (2022a) for some potential explanations.

Chain of thought elicits ""reasoning"" of LLMs. The use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts (Wei et al., 2022b) has been shown to improve the performance of LLMs on various reasoning tasks, as demonstrated in the experiments of Wei et al. (2022a,b); . Additionally, Saparov and He (2022) ( §4.2) find that, when using CoT prompts, LLMs are able to produce valid individual proof steps, even when the synthetic ontology is fictional or counterfactual. However, they may sometimes choose the wrong steps when multiple options are available, leading to incomplete or incorrect proofs. Moreover, for many reasoning tasks where the performance of standard prompting grows smoothly with model scale, chain-of-thought prompting can lead to dramatic performance improvement. In addition to these benefits, the use of CoT prompts has been shown to improve the out-ofdistribution robustness of LLMs (Wei et al., 2022b;Zhou et al., 2022a;Anil et al., 2022, inter alia), an advantage that is not typically observed with standard prompting or fully supervised finetuning paradigms.

LLMs show human-like content effects on reasoning. According to Dasgupta et al. (2022), LLMs exhibit reasoning patterns that are similar to those of humans as described in the cognitive literature. For example, the models' predictions are influenced by both prior knowledge and abstract reasoning, and their judgments of logical validity are impacted by the believability of the conclusions. These findings suggest that, although language models may not always perform well on reasoning tasks, their failures often occur in situations that are challenging for humans as well. This provides some evidence that language models may ""reason"" in a way that is similar to human reasoning.

LLMs are still unskilled at complex reasoning. Although LLMs seem to possess impressive reasoning capabilities with the techniques described in §3, they still struggle with more complex reasoning tasks or those involving implicature, according to studies such as Valmeekam et al. (2022);Han et al. (2022a); Ruis et al. (2022). For instance, Valmeekam et al. (2022) find that even in relatively simple commonsense planning domains that humans would have no trouble navigating, LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) struggle to perform effectively. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks may be too simple to accurately gauge the true reasoning abilities of LLMs, and that more challenging tasks may be needed to fully evaluate their abilities in this regard.","[[], ['b77', None], ['b77', 'b78', None], ['b18'], ['b58', None, 'b71']]","[[], ['b77', None], ['b77', 'b78', None], ['b18'], ['b58', None, 'b71']]",9,"sent1: In this section, we summarize the important findings and implications of studies on reasoning in large language models.

Most domains have seen efforts in analyzing human dialogue behaviors and their impact on task outcomes. Examples include analyzing deception in games (Peskov et al., 2020), the impact of persuasive strategies and dialogue acts on charity donations ( In addition, researchers have targeted various domain-specific subtasks that can be crucial for the eventual development of dialogue systems in this space. This involves research in lie detection methods (Yeh and Ku, 2021;Yu et al., 2015), discourse parsing (Shi and Huang, 2019;Ouyang et al., 2021), strategy prediction (Chawla et al., 2021b;, breakdown detection (Yamaguchi et al., 2021), outcome prediction (Sinha and Dasgupta, 2021;Chawla et al., 2020;Dutt et al., 2020), and argument mining (Dutta et al., 2022).

Research that directly targets the development of dialogue systems in this space is still nascent. Among other challenges like limited cross-cultural diversity and relatively smaller dataset size, social influence dialogue settings pose a unique challenge: an average human often exhibits sub-optimal strategic behaviors in social influence tasks (Wunderle, 2007;Babcock and Laschever, 2009). This means that standard seq2seq approaches trained on these collected datasets using supervised learning are fundamentally insufficient for developing effective dialogue systems with influence capabilities.

This corresponds to the usual sequenceto-sequence framework that has been a standard baseline for the methods developed in this space. An important example is the work by Lewis et al. (2017), who were one of the first works to train endto-end dialogue models that exhibit social influence.

Borrowing from task-oriented and open-domain research, existing dialogue models for social influence use a variety of methods to generate the final system response.

Templates and retrieval methods: Predefined templates and response retrieval from the training data simplify the generation pipeline, improving controllability and modularity. He et al. (2018) used templates in their generator which are later filled by retrieving similar responses from the data. This allowed the authors to explore supervised and reinforcement learning at the level of DAs for the influence strategy of the system. Conditional Generation: Text generation methods result in more diverse responses, but negatively impact the controllability and interpretability.

While end-to-end methods improve the diversity and need less manual effort, a modularized design enhances controllability and explainability. Perhaps, this is why modular methods are popular in large-scale models (Hadfi et al., 2021). Improving the control of desired variables such as topics, strategy, or emotion in the end-to-end methods is an open area of research and is yet to be explored for social influence dialogue systems. The performance was later improved by Joshi et al. (2020), who replaced FSTs with Graph Neural Networks to better model the interdependencies. Others have relied on RL to explicitly optimize the model on task-specific objective outcomes. While SL trains the model to mimic the average human behavior, RL techniques, such as those based on REINFORCE (Williams, 1992), allow the system to explore its own strategies in the wild while being guided by one or more overall reward metrics. Lewis et al. (2017) used RL in negotiations, with the final points scored in the agreed deal as the reward. More recent work employed RL to incorporate simplistic partner models into the decisionmaking process of the dialogue system, showing improvements in negotiation tasks (Zhang et al., 2020b;Yang et al., 2021).

Multi-tasking and Pretraining: Limited efforts have also explored multi-tasking and pretrained language models for social influence dialogue systems, which provide promising ways to deal with the challenge of insufficient training data.

However, building sophisticated and practically useful systems remains a challenging endeavor. Several limitations still exist that must be addressed. To guide future work, we now discuss the key challenges and provide our recommendations. Need for unifying the efforts: One challenge in this space has been the lack of large-scale datasets for model training. Social influence tasks are complex for crowdsourcing workers to understand and to participate in. Hence, prior work used extensive instructions and tutorials, making the study expensive and time consuming Chawla et al., 2021b). To address this, we recommend the researchers to aim for a more unified view of the efforts in social influence. First, this would encourage researchers to adopt the best practices from other social influence scenarios. For instance, most datasets miss out on user attributes like demographics and personality, which are crucial in social influence scenarios (Stuhlmacher and Walters, 1999;Bogaert et al., 2008). Most datasets also ignore the partner perception after the interaction is over. This can result in misleading conclusions about the model performance, where the models perform well objectively, but hurt the relationship with their partners, and thus, negatively impacting practical utility (Aydogan et al., 2020).

Secondly, a holistic outlook will promote transfer learning and domain adaptation. Our taxonomy for datasets (Table 1) governs the way systems must be modeled and trained. Task structure is crucial to understand whether the model can learn from the utterances of all parties or just one. Further, understanding the context definition guides how it must be encoded. Hence, one interesting future direction is joint training on datasets with similar structure and context definition. Finally, progress in task-oriented and opendomain systems can inspire more unified modeling for social influence tasks involving multiple skills in the same interaction (e.g. a combination of negotiation and persuasion tactics as common in realistic scenarios). Roller et al. (2020) blend various open-domain tasks to address multiple challenges together (e.g., persona-based, knowledge-enriched, etc.). Hosseini-Asl et al. (2020) concatenate structured and unstructured data in task-oriented dialogues, and unify task-oriented dialogue system building to be a single sequence generation problem. Future work should explore similar unified approaches for social influence settings as well, especially since these tasks follow a common conceptual foundation (Figure 1), with similar evaluation and theoretical principles (Cialdini, 2009).

To encourage this unified view, we encapsulate our insights from this survey effort in a theoretical framework, which is presented in Appendix C. The framework covers key components for designing a social influence dialogue task, including system attributes, target audience, underlying modeling techniques, and evaluation mechanisms. Theory integration: Most modeling efforts are based on crowdsourced datasets. Since crowdsourcing workers may not exhibit optimal strategies, supervised training on these datasets is fundamentally insufficient to build an effective system for applications like pedagogy (teaching social skills to students). Unfortunately, this holds regardless of how system strategy and partner model are designed. Further, using RL to optimize on objective rewards is also not expected to be enough to reliably learn complex influence capabilities, especially when the reward is restrictive.

To address this, we recommend to tap into the vast amount of research effort in social sciences and psychology on building theories for social influence (Cameron, 2009;Giles, 2016;Lewicki et al., 2016;Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004). Instead of solely relying on the collected data, future work should consider leveraging fundamentals from this research to guide the dialogue policy. Previous works have studied resistance to social influence (Knowles and Linn, 2004;Dal Cin et al., 2004;Petty and Cacioppo, 1977;Ahluwalia, 2000). Rucker et al. (2004) found that people resist persuasion differently depending on their beliefs, suggest-ing personalizing the social influence process.

Prior work majorly focused on objective metrics which only provides a limited view of the model performance. A comprehensive evaluation is challenging since it must consider partner perception along with objective outcomes. Building user simulators could potentially alleviate this problem (Li et al., 2016;Jain et al., 2018;. Most existing simulators are developed for task-oriented systems which follow a certain agenda. Future research should study how to use partner modeling to build social influence user simulators for more efficient and accurate task evaluation (He et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2020). For instance, one could potentially design different user personalities and simulate the change in user's beliefs, opinions, and attitudes accordingly (Yang et al., 2021).

Multimodal systems: Being a core function of human communication, social influence occurs not just through text, but through all possible modalities. Schulman and Bickmore (2009) showed that embodied agents achieve better persuasion results than text-only agents. Other studies have recognized the importance of emotion in social influence tasks (Asai et al., 2020;Chawla et al., 2021a). Nguyen et al. (2021) proposed a speech dataset in debates and study the influence of spoken tactics on persuasiveness across genders. Given these findings, we encourage interdisciplinary efforts in the future to explore the developement of multimodal social influence agents.

Knowledge-enriched systems: Social influence tasks often involve constantly-changing world knowledge such as organization facts and news. Often, the system's internal state (e.g., the change of task setting from one set of products to a different set) needs to be updated. Retraining the entire system is costly to maintain after the initial development.

Research on how we use influence in all aspects of our lives spans a number of fields, including social psychology, communication, consumer behavior, behavioral change, and behavioral economics. This research has led to crucial findings about the strategies of social influence and how they impact our decision-making. Over the past few decades, research has accumulated and demonstrated the effectiveness of using various strategies across contexts and domains. Prominent examples include core principles of social influence by Cialdini from social psychology: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, liking and attractiveness, authority, and scarcity (Cialdini, 2009). Further, communication strategies used in persuasion and general social influence contexts include credibility appeals, two-sided argumentation, emotional tactics, and appeals to social norms, among others (Cameron, 2009;O'keefe, 2015). First, the well-studied principles in social influence research can guide the development of effective dialogue systems with influence capabilities. In fact, many of the strategies found in the datasets developed for social influence tasks (Section 3) directly map to the principles laid out by Cialdini, for instance, credibility and emotional appeal in PersuasionForGood dataset  and reciprocity observed in CaSiNo negotiation dataset (Chawla et al., 2021b). Second, research in social influence dialogue systems provides novel datasets on human-human and humanmachine communication, and therefore, holds a great potential to advance theories of human cogni-tion and influence processes (Gratch et al., 2015). The datasets and subsequent analyses can further contribute new theoretical insights to social influence research.

Although dialogue systems have already been used in a number of applications involving chatbots and AI assistants, advancements in social influence dialogue systems can help to bridge the gap between our existing task definitions and a number of other real-world applications. For instance, realistic customer support interactions often involve active behaviors from both the support agent and the user where the agent uses social cues for improved customer satisfaction and retention, while the user attempts to address their queries. These settings naturally involve aspects of social influence, unlike traditional task-oriented definitions where the dialogue system plays a passive role to assist the human users. As discussed earlier, social influence dialogue systems can positively help to advance other areas as well. In therapy domain, these systems can assist in various psychological treatments such as by increasing the willingness to disclose (Lucas et al., 2014). In pedagogy, they can help to make social skills training more accessible (Johnson et al., 2019).

While we think about these applications, it is crucial to also lay out proper ethical guidelines to avoid any misuse of these systems. Primary concerns are around the use of deception (e.g. in Diplomacy and other negotiation tasks), emotional appeals (e.g. in persuasion), and behavior change (e.g. in conversational recommendations).

To mitigate possible misuse scenarios or unintended harms, we now lay out a few ethical guidelines which also apply to dialogue research in general. First, rigorous attempts must be made to ensure that the data collection, design processes, and evaluations, strictly abide by the guidelines and regulations laid out by the relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB). Second, the research team needs to develop a thorough plan to monitor and understand the behaviors of the developed systems before deployment. This includes identifying the goals of the dialogue system, identifying potential toxic language use, and any discriminatory behaviors. Third, investment into improved data collection practices, along with explainable and controllable dialogue systems can help identify these issues early on and allow manipulation to avoid them. Fourth, we argue that transparency is the key.

All stakeholders must be made aware of the goals and design objectives of the system, along with any known misbehaviors or potential risks. The users must also be informed of any data collected during the deployment phase. Lastly, we believe that continuous monitoring of dialogue systems is necessary to ensure that the system performs consistently and does not diverge to unexpected conditions that may incur offensive or discriminative actions.

In total, we curated 22 datasets from prior work that capture social influence in various forms, spanning 12 publication venues, 4 languages, and 7 application domains (see Appendix A for details on the compilation process). In general, the datasets capture the following information about an interaction: the non-conversational context for the participants (e.g. negotiation preferences or other role-specific information), the conversation between them, and outcome assessment. Optionally, some datasets also gather participant demographics and personality traits, utterance-level annotations, and subjective evaluations via post-surveys.

To understand the structural similarities and differences between these datasets, we design a taxonomy with two primary dimensions: Task Structure (Symmetric vs Asymmetric), and Context Definition (Global vs Local). Task Structure captures whether the participant roles are defined in a sym-metric or an asymmetric manner. For instance, a typical multi-issue negotiation is symmetric, in the sense that both parties have their own preferences and goals based on which they actively try to reach a favorable agreement (Lewis et al., 2017). On the other hand, a counseling session between a therapist and a patient is asymmetric, where the therapist attempts to emotionally support the patient by employing social influence skills (Althoff et al., 2016). Context Definition relates to whether the input context before each interaction is defined globally or locally. For instance, the PersuasionFor-Good dataset globally defines the context of persuasion for charity donation, which is kept the same throughout . On the contrary, in a typical debate, although the rules are defined globally, the conversation topic and arguments are local and can vary for each conversation (Durmus and Cardie, 2019). We present this categorization in Table 1. We further categorize the datasets according to their Domain, Source, and the # of parties. We provide key statistics and the available metadata in Appendix B. We now briefly discuss the datasets in each domain.

Games: Strategy games involve social influence dynamics of trust and deception. Diplomacy captures deception in long-lasting relationships, where players forge and break alliances to dominate Europe (Peskov et al., 2020). Catan revolves around the trade of resources for acquiring roads, settlements, and cities (Asher et al., 2016;Boritchev and Amblard, 2021). The players have access to only a subset of resources that they would need, which encourages strategic influence and trade.

Multi-Issue Bargaining Tasks (MIBT): MIBT is a tractable closed-domain abstraction of a typical negotiation (Fershtman, 1990). It is based on a fixed set of issues each with a predefined priority for each player, which essentially governs the goals of the players. If the priorities of the players align, this leads to competitive negotiations, where each party attempts to convince their partner with tradeoffs and persuasive arguments. If they don't, this allows cooperative interactions where the negotiators try to find optimal divisions that benefit everyone. DealOrNoDeal (Lewis et al., 2017) involves negotiations over three issues: books, balls, and hats. Other datasets define a more grounded scenario, such as symmetric CaSiNo (Chawla et al., 2021b) negotiations between two campsite neighbors and asymmetric JobInterview (Yamaguchi et al., 2021)   negotiations between recruiters and applicants. Social Good: Social influence is critical for social good applications. The tactics must be personalized using knowledge that is both relevant and appealing. PersuasionForGood  involves asymmetric interactions led by a persuader who attempts to convince the other participant for charity donation by employing a variety of tactics. For instance, Logical Appeal uses reason and evidence to support the argument, while Emotional Appeal elicits specific emotions. E-commerce: These tasks are typically asymmetric. A buyer influences the seller towards a reasonable price, while the seller tries to maximize their own profit. An effective system must combine price-related reasoning with language realization. CraigslistBargain (He et al., 2018) involves openended price negotiations with rich influence strategies like embellishments, side offers, emotional appeals, and using world knowledge. Another example is customer support interactions in AntiScam dataset (Li et al., 2020), where users defend themselves against attackers who try to steal sensitive personal information with convincing arguments.

Therapy & Support: Effective therapy using social influence aids in the treatment of mental disorders, and substance use disorders, along with changing undesirable behaviors like unhealthy diets. A counselor needs to be adaptive, personalized, should understand the core issues, and should facilitate a change in patient's perspective (Althoff et al., 2016). In SMS counseling, Althoff et al. (2016) found that linguistic influence like pushing the conversation in the desired direction is associated with perspective change. Similar scenarios were captured in other datasets as well (Demasi et al., 2019;Liang et al., 2021). Tanana et al. (2016) collected the Motivational Interviewing dataset where the goal is to elicit and explore the patient's own motivations for behavior change. EmpatheticDialogues (Rashkin et al., 2019) captured empathetic support interactions, which has been associated with rapport and better task outcomes (Kim et al., 2004;Norfolk et al., 2007;Fraser et al., 2018).

Argumentation: In addition to factuality and social proof, a convincing argument must also consider the intensity, valence, authoritativeness, and framing (Chaiken, 1987;Althoff et al., 2014). Tan et al. (2016) released the ChangeMyView logs from Reddit, involving discussions on numerous controversial topics. Other datasets include Debate Dot Org (DDO) debates on diverse topics (Durmus and Cardie, 2019), congressional proceedings (Thomas et al., 2006), and court hearings (Fornaciari and Poesio, 2012;D.-N.-M. et al., 2012;Ji et al., 2020). Conversational Recommendation: Everyday scenarios naturally hold potential for influence via recommendations, for instance, a movie fan per-suading their friends to watch a movie that they adore.  and Dodge et al. (2016) collected movie recommendation datasets. Instead of guiding the conversation towards a specific movie, the goal is simply to provide recommendations based on facts and personal experiences. Nevertheless, they still provide interesting examples of scenarios that can involve social influence.

Miscellaneous: The Target-Guided dataset (Tang et al., 2019) was constructed from the PersonaChat corpus (Zhang et al., 2018).

Instead of being openended, the Target-Guided scenario defines a concrete goal of naturally guiding the conversation to a designated target subject, thereby, making it a social influence setting.","[[], [None, 'b18'], [None, 'b33'], ['b23', 'b5', None, 'b54', 'b18'], ['b30', 'b24', 'b13', None, 'b47'], ['b46', None, 'b10', 'b49'], ['b48', 'b61'], []]","[[], [None, 'b18'], [None, 'b33'], ['b23', 'b5', None, 'b54', 'b18'], ['b30', 'b24', 'b13', None, 'b47'], ['b46', None, 'b10', 'b49'], ['b48', 'b61'], []]",20,"sent1: We now illustrate social influence across numerous domains and application areas.
sent2: In total, we curated 22 datasets from prior work that capture social influence in various forms, spanning 12 publication venues, 4 languages, and 7 application domains (see Appendix A for details on the compilation process).
sent3: In general, the datasets capture the following information about an interaction: the non-conversational context for the participants (e.g. negotiation preferences or other role-specific information), the conversation between them, and outcome assessment.
sent4: Optionally, some datasets also gather participant demographics and personality traits, utterance-level annotations, and subjective evaluations via post-surveys.
sent5: To understand the structural similarities and differences between these datasets, we design a taxonomy with two primary dimensions: Task Structure (Symmetric vs Asymmetric), and Context Definition (Global vs Local).
sent6: Task Structure captures whether the participant roles are defined in a sym-metric or an asymmetric manner.
sent7: For instance, a typical multi-issue negotiation is symmetric, in the sense that both parties have their own preferences and goals based on which they actively try to reach a favorable agreement (Lewis et al., 2017).
sent8: On the other hand, a counseling session between a therapist and a patient is asymmetric, where the therapist attempts to emotionally support the patient by employing social influence skills (Althoff et al., 2016).
sent9: Context Definition relates to whether the input context before each interaction is defined globally or locally.
sent10: For instance, the PersuasionFor-Good dataset globally defines the context of persuasion for charity donation, which is kept the same throughout .
sent11: On the contrary, in a typical debate, although the rules are defined globally, the conversation topic and arguments are local and can vary for each conversation (Durmus and Cardie, 2019).
sent12: We present this categorization in Table 1.
sent13: We further categorize the datasets according to their Domain, Source, and the # of parties.
sent14: We provide key statistics and the available metadata in
sent15: Appendix B. We now briefly discuss the datasets in each domain.
sent16: Games: Strategy games involve social influence dynamics of trust and deception.
sent17: Diplomacy captures deception in long-lasting relationships, where players forge and break alliances to dominate Europe (Peskov et al., 2020).
sent18: Catan revolves around the trade of resources for acquiring roads, settlements, and cities (Asher et al., 2016;Boritchev and Amblard, 2021).
sent19: The players have access to only a subset of resources that they would need, which encourages strategic influence and trade.
sent20: Multi-Issue Bargaining Tasks (MIBT): MIBT is a tractable closed-domain abstraction of a typical negotiation (Fershtman, 1990).
sent21: It is based on a fixed set of issues each with a predefined priority for each player, which essentially governs the goals of the players.
sent22: If the priorities of the players align, this leads to competitive negotiations, where each party attempts to convince their partner with tradeoffs and persuasive arguments.
sent23: If they don't, this allows cooperative interactions where the negotiators try to find optimal divisions that benefit everyone.
sent24: DealOrNoDeal (Lewis et al., 2017) involves negotiations over three issues: books, balls, and hats.
sent25: Other datasets define a more grounded scenario, such as symmetric CaSiNo (Chawla et al., 2021b) negotiations between two campsite neighbors and asymmetric JobInterview (Yamaguchi et al., 2021)   negotiations between recruiters and applicants.
sent26: Social Good: Social influence is critical for social good applications.
sent27: The tactics must be personalized using knowledge that is both relevant and appealing.
sent28: PersuasionForGood  involves asymmetric interactions led by a persuader who attempts to convince the other participant for charity donation by employing a variety of tactics.

It is the change in thoughts, feelings, attitudes, or behaviors resulting from interaction with an individual or a group (Rashotte, 2007). Influence is measured by quantifiable proxies of the observed change, like the interest to indulge in physical exercise before or after the interaction with a system, or the final deal in a negotiation as opposed to one person taking it all. Social influence dialogue systems act interactively and influence their partners in decision-making and behavioral contexts (Zhang et al., 2020a;Lee et al., 2020). This calls for an active role by the system, distinguishing them from other well-studied scenarios, such as purely task-oriented, where systems passively assist their partners to complete tasks, and opendomain, that target social companionship. Key social influence tasks include persuasion , aiming to change users' attitudes or behaviors, and negotiation, aiming to change the users' perspective to achieve a common ground (Lewis et al., 2017). Conceptual overview: Figure 1 distinguishes between the kinds of conversational content in social influence interactions. The task-oriented content focuses on influencing for a domain-specific goal, like persuading for donation, bargaining with tradeoffs, or encouraging healthier habits. These interactions may also contain social content, such as small talk, empathy, or self-disclosure. The task-oriented content provides a context for social interactions. Depending on the task, social content is optional, but if present, can in turn build rapport and enhance user-system relationship for improved task outcomes (Liao et al., 2021). Connections with task-oriented and opendomain systems: Similar to a task-oriented or an open-domain scenario, social influence dialogue can also be seen as a sequential decision making process with the goal of maximizing the expected reward Gao et al., 2018). Our proposed category is not meant to be disjoint from these traditional categories. However, it still uniquely brings together the tasks that capture social influence, which is fundamentally absent from how we primarily define dialogue tasks in the community. Defining a new category that captures social influence dialogue would foster a dedicated effort towards this important aspect of real-world conversations.

Task-oriented scenarios focus on collaborative information exchange for a common goal of task completion. In social influence tasks, the goals of the system and the user can be different and even conflicting, leading to collaborative or noncollaborative interactions. Further, the goals can go beyond the current task (e.g. multiple therapy interactions, repeated negotiations), leading to social interactions for long-term relationships. If a scenario involves the system's goal to influence its partner, we consider it under social influence in this paper. For instance, He et al. (2018) studied buyerseller price negotiations. The task of the buyer is to negotiate for a reasonable price (arguably making it task-oriented), but achieving it requires social influence skills of engaging in trade-offs and building a rapport with the seller so as to reach an agreement. Measures of Success: The above discussion indicates that a comprehensive evaluation of social influence systems must draw from both task-oriented and open-domain dialogue research. Since there exist surveys that discuss the evaluation in these settings (Deriu et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021), we don't cover them here in detail. However, we define three essential axes for evaluation: 1) Linguistic Performance, or the system's linguistic sophistication based on automatic (e.g. perplexity, BLEU) and human (e.g. fluency, consistency, coherency) evaluation. 2) Influence Outcome, or the ability to influence defined by objective goals like the negotiated price or weight loss after therapy. 3) Partner Perception, or the subjective evaluation of the user, for instance, the user's satisfaction, likeness towards the system, and interest in interacting again. In a buyer-seller negotiation, if the seller hates the buyer in the end, no matter how favorable the deal is for the buyer, one might argue that this is still a failed negotiation for the buyer. Hence, we encourage future work to take all three dimensions into account collectively.","[['b0', 'b38', 'b1', 'b16', 'b60', 'b25', 'b18'], [None, 'b52', 'b5']]","[['b0', 'b38', 'b1', 'b16', 'b60', 'b25', 'b18'], [None, 'b52', 'b5']]",10,"sent1: ""Social influence is a fact of everyday life"" (Gass, 2015).

Analogous to text sentences,  and Xiao et al. (2022) treated the user's clicked news history as input text and proposed to model user behavior in an auto-regressive manner for next-click prediction. However, as the sequential dependency may not always hold strictly in terms of user preference for recommendations (Yuan et al., 2020a), MLM objectives can be modified accordingly. Yuan et al.

Geng et al. (2022b) modeled a series of paths sampled from a knowledge graph in an auto-regressive manner for recommendation by generating the end node from the pretrained model. Zhao (2022) proposed pre-training the Rearrange Sequence Prediction task to learn the sequence-level information of the user's entire interaction history by predicting whether the user interaction history had been rearranged, which is similar to Permuted Language Modelling (PerLM) (Yang et al., 2019).

Among language modelling objectives, autoregressive, reconstruction, and auxiliary are three categories commonly used (Liu et al., 2023b). Here, we only introduce several language modelling objectives used for RSs.

Partial/ Auto-regressive Modelling (P/AM) Given a text sequence X 1:T = [x 1 , x 2 , · · · x T ], the training objective of AM can be summarized as a joint negative log-likelihood of each variable given all previous variables:

Modern LMRS typically utilize popular pretrained left-to-right LMs such as GPT-2 (Hada and Shevade, 2021) and DialoGPT (Wang et al., 2022a,c) as the backbone for explainable and conversational recommendations, respectively, to avoid the laborious task of pre-training from scratch. While auto-regressive objectives can effectively model context dependency, the modelling context can only be accessed from one direction, primarily left-to-right. To address this limitation, PAM is introduced, which extends AM by enabling the factorization step to be a span. For each input X, one factorization order M is sampled. One popular PTM that includes PAM as an objective is UniLMv2 (Bao et al., 2020). The pretrained UniLMv2 model can be utilized to initialize the news embedding model for news recommendation (Yu et al., 2022). Besides directly leveraging PTMs trained on textual inputs, some researchers apply this objective to train inputs with sequential patterns, such as graphs (Geng et al., 2022b) and user-item interactions . These patterns serve as either scoring functions to select suitable paths from the start node/user to the end node/item or detectors to explore novel user-item pairs. Masked Language Modelling (MLM) Taking a sequence of textual sentences as input, MLM first masks a token or multi-tokens with a special token such as [M ASK]. Then the model is trained to predict the masked tokens taking the rest of the tokens as context. The objective is as follows:

where M (X) and X M (X) represent the masked tokens in the input sequence X and the rest of the tokens in X respectively. A typical example of MLM training strategy can be found on BERT, which is leveraged as backbone in (Zhang et al., 2021a) to capture user-news matching signals for news recommendation. Concurrently, some research works propose multiple enhanced versions of MLM. RoBERTa  

where x and y represent two segments from the input corpus, and c = 1 if x and y are consecutive, otherwise c = 0. The NSP objective involves reasoning about the relationships between pairs of sentences and can be utilized for better representation learning of textual items such as news articles, item descriptions, and conversational data for recommendation purposes. Moreover, it can be employed to model the intimate relationships between two components. Malkiel et al. (2020) used the NSP to capture the relationship between the title and description of an item for next-item prediction. Furthermore, models pre-trained with NSP (such as BERT) can be leveraged for probing the learned knowledge with prompts, which are then infused in the fine-tuning stage to improve model training on adversarial data for conversational recommendation (Penha and Hauff, 2020). Sentence Order Prediction (SOP) as a variation of the NSP takes two consecutive segments from the same document as positive examples, which are then swapped in order as negative examples. SOP has been used to learn the inner coherence of title, description, and code for tag recommendation on StackOverflow (He et al., 2022).

Nevertheless, some researchers have questioned the necessity and effectiveness of the NSP and SOP for downstream tasks (He et al., 2022), which highlights the need for further investigation in recommendation scenarios. Replaced Token Detection(RTD) It is used to predict whether a token is replaced given its surrounding context:

In this paradigm, fine-tuning can be avoided, and the pretrained model itself can be directly employed to predict item ratings, generate top-k item ranking lists, make conversations, recommend similar libraries for programmers while coding, or even output subtasks related to recommendation targets such as explanations (Li et al., 2023b). Prompt learning breaks through the problem of data constraints and bridges the gap of objective forms between pre-training and fine-tuning. Fixed-PTM prompt tuning Prompt-tuning only requires tuning a small set of parameters for the prompts and labels, which is especially efficient for few-shot recommendation tasks. Despite the promising results achieved through constructing prompt information without significantly changing the structure and parameters of PTMs, it also calls for the necessity of choosing the most appropriate prompt template and verbalizer, which can greatly impact recommendation performance. Prompt tuning can be both in the form of discrete textual templates (Penha and Hauff, 2020), which are more human-readable, and soft continuous vectors (Wang et al., 2022c;Wu et al., 2022b). For instance, Penha and Hauff (2020) manually designed several prompt templates to test the performance of movie/book recommendations on a pre-trained BERT model with a similarity measure. Wu et al. (2022b) proposed a personalized prompt generator tuned to generate a soft prompt as a prefix before the user behaviour sequence for sequential recommendation. Fixed-prompt PTM tuning Fixed-prompt PTM tuning tunes the parameters of PTMs similarly to the ""pre-train, fine-tune"" strategy but additionally uses prompts with fixed parameters to steer the recommendation task. One natural way is to use artificially designed discrete prompt to specify recommendation items. For instance, Zhang et al.

(2021b) designed a prompt ""A user watched item A, item B, and item C. Now the user may want to watch () "" to reformulate the recommendation as a multi-token cloze task during fine-tuning of the LM-based PTM. The prompts can also be one or several tokens/words to seamlessly shift/lead the conversations from various tasks. Deng et al. (2023)  token as a prompt to indicate the start of the recommendation process and to summarize the dialogue context for the conversational recommendation.

Tuning-free prompting This training strategy can be referred to as zero-shot recommendations, which directly generate recommendations or/and related subtasks without changing the parameters of the PTMs but based only on the input prompts. Zero-shot recommendation has been shown to be effective in dealing with new users/items in one domain or cross-domain settings (Sileo et al., 2022;Geng et al., 2022c), compared to state-ofthe-art baselines. Specifically, Geng et al. (2022c) learned multiple tasks, such as sequential recommendation, rating prediction, explanation generation, review summarization and direct recommendation, in a unified way with the same Negative Log-likelihood (NLL) training objectives during pre-training. At the inference stage, a series of carefully designed discrete textual template prompts were taken as input, including prompts for recommending items in the new domain (not appearing in the pre-training phase), and the trained model outputs the preferable results without a fine-tuning stage. The reason for the effectiveness of zero-shot recommendation is that the training data and pre-training tasks are able to distil rich knowledge of semantics and correlations from diverse modalities into user and item tokens, which can comprehend user preference behaviours w.r.t. item characteristics (Geng et al., 2022c). Building upon this research, Geng et al. (2023) extended their efforts to train an adapter for diverse multimodal assignments, including sequential recommendations, direct recommendations, and the generation of explanations. In particular, they utilized the pre-trained CLIP component to convert images into image tokens. These tokens were added to the textual tokens of an item to create a personalized multimodal soft prompt. This com-bined prompt was then used as input to fine-tune the adapter in an autoregressive manner. Prompt+PTM tuning In this setting, the parameters include two parts: prompt-relevant parameters and model parameters. The tuning phase involves optimizing all parameters for specific recommendation tasks. Prompt+PTM tuning differs from the ""pre-train, fine-tune the holistic model"" strategy by providing additional prompts that can provide additional bootstrapping at the start of model training. For example, Li et al. (2023b) proposed a continuous prompt learning approach by first fixing the PTM, tuning the prompt to bridge the gap between the continuous prompts and the loaded PTM, and then fine-tuning both the prompt and PTM, resulting in a higher BLUE score in empirical results. They combined both discrete prompts (three user/item feature keywords, such as gym, breakfast, and Wi-Fi) and soft prompts (user/item embeddings) to generate recommendation explanations. Case studies showed improvements in the readability and fluency of generated explanations using the proposed prompts. Note that the Prompt+PTM tuning stage does not necessarily mean the fine-tuning stage but can be any possible stage for tuning parameters from both sides for specific data input. Xin et al. (2022) adapted a reinforcement learning framework as a Prompt+PTM tuning strategy by learning rewardstate pairs as soft prompt encodings w.r.t. observed actions during training.

As illustrated in Figure 1, there are mainly two classes regarding different training paradigms: pre-train, fine-tune paradigm and prompt learning paradigm. Each class is further classified into subclasses regarding different training efforts on different parts of the recommendation model. This section will go through various training strategies w.r.t. specific recommendation purposes. Figure  2(a) presents the statistics of recent publications of LMRSs grouped by different training strategies and the total number of published research works each year. Figure 2(b) shows the taxonomy and some corresponding representative LMRSs.

4.1 Pre-train, fine-tune paradigm for RS

The ""pre-train, fine-tune"" paradigm attracts increasing attention from researchers in the recommendation field due to several advantages: 1) Pre-training provides a better model initialization, which usually leads to better generalization on different downstream recommendation tasks, improves recommendation performance from various perspectives, and speeds up convergence on the fine-tuning stage; 2) Pre-training on huge source corpus can learn universal knowledge which can be beneficial for the downstream recommenders; 3) Pre-training can be regarded as a kind of regularization to avoid overfitting on lowresource, and small datasets (Erhan et al., 2010).

Pre-train This training strategy can be seen as traditional end-to-end training with domain input. Differently, we only focus on research works adapting LM-based learning objectives into the training phase. Many typical LM-based RSs fall into this category, such as BERT4Rec , which models sequential user behaviour with a bidirectional self-attention network through Cloze task, and Transformers4Rec (de Souza Pereira Moreira et al., 2021) which adopts a haggingface transformer-based architecture as the base model for next-item prediction and explores four different LM tasks, namely Causal LM, MLM, Permutation LM, and Replacement Token Detection during training. These two models laid the foundation for LM-based recommender systems and have become popular baselines for their successors.

Pre-train, fine-tune holistic model Under this category, the model is pre-trained and fine-tuned with different data sources, and the fine-tuning process will go through adjusting the whole model parameters. The learning objectives can also vary between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Pre-training and fine-tuning with different domains of data sources, also called cross-domain recommendation, can refer to the works of Kang et al. (2021) and Qiu et al. (2021). Kang et al. (2021) pre-trained a GPT model using segmented source API code and fine-tuned it with API code snippets from another library for cross-library recommendation. Wang et al. (2022a) fine-tuned the pre-trained DialoGPT model on domain-specific datasets for conversational recommendation together with an R-GCN model to inject knowledge from DBpedia to enhance recommendation perfor- mance. Xiao et al. (2022) fine-tuned the PTM to learn news embedding together with a user embedding part in an auto-regressive manner for news recommendation. They also explored different fine-tuning strategies like tuning part of the PTM and tuning the last layer of the PTM but empirically found fine-tuning the whole model resulted in better performance, which gives us an insight into balancing the recommendation accuracy and training efficiency.

Pre-train, fine-tune partial model Since finetuning the whole model is usually time-consuming and less flexible, many LMRSs choose to fine-tune partial parameters of the model to achieve a balance between training overhead and recommendation performance (Hou et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2022;Wu et al., 2022a). For instance, to deal with the domain bias problem that BERT induces a non-smooth anisotropic semantic space for general texts resulting in a large language gap for texts from different domains of items, Hou et al. (2022) applied a linear transformation layer to transform BERT representations of items from different domains followed by an adaptive combination strategy to derive a universal item representation. Meanwhile, considering the seesaw phenomenon that learning from multiple domainspecific behavioural patterns can be a conflict, they proposed sequence-item and sequence-sequence contrastive tasks for multi-task learning during the pre-training stage. They found only fine-tuning a small proportion of model parameters could quickly adapt the model to unseen domains with cold-start or new items. Pre-train, fine-tune extra part of the model With the increase in the depth of PTMs, the representation captured by them makes the downstream recommendation easier. Apart from the aforementioned two fine-tuning strategies, some works leverage a task-specific layer on top of the PTMs for recommendation tasks. Fine-tuning only goes through such extra parts of the PTMs by optimizing the parameters of the task-specific layer. Shang et al. (2019) pre-trained a GPT and a BERT model to learn patient visit embeddings, which were then used as input to fine-tune the extra prediction layer for medication recommendation. Another approach is to use the PTM to initialize a new model with a similar architecture in the finetuning stage, and the fine-tuned model is used for recommendations. In , a bidirectional Transformer-based model was first pretrained on four different self-supervised learning objectives (associated attribute prediction, masked item prediction, masked attribute prediction and segment prediction) to learn item embeddings. Then, the learned model parameters were adopted to initialize a unidirectional Transformer-based model for fine-tuning with pairwise rank loss for recommendation. In (McKee et al., 2023), the authors leveraged the pre-trained BLOOM-176B to generate natural languages descriptions of music given a set of music tags. Subsequently, two distinct pre-trained models, namely CLIP and the D2T pipeline, were employed to initialize textual, video, and audio representations of the provided music content. Following this, a transformerbased architecture model was fine-tuned for multimodal music recommendation.","[[], [], ['b5'], [], ['b45', 'b17', 'b36', 'b53'], ['b61', 'b32', 'b50', 'b15', 'b39']]","[[], [], ['b5'], [], ['b45', 'b17', 'b36', 'b53'], ['b61', 'b32', 'b50', 'b15', 'b39']]",10,"sent1: Given the significant impact that PLMs have had on NLP tasks in the pre-train and fine-tune paradigm, there has been a surge recently in adapting such paradigms to multiple recommendation tasks.

sent27: Shang et al. (2019) pre-trained a GPT and a BERT model to learn patient visit embeddings, which were then used as input to fine-tune the extra prediction layer for medication recommendation.
sent28: Another approach is to use the PTM to initialize a new model with a similar architecture in the finetuning stage, and the fine-tuned model is used for recommendations.
sent29: In , a bidirectional Transformer-based model was first pretrained on four different self-supervised learning objectives (associated attribute prediction, masked item prediction, masked attribute prediction and segment prediction) to learn item embeddings.
sent30: Then, the learned model parameters were adopted to initialize a unidirectional Transformer-based model for fine-tuning with pairwise rank loss for recommendation.
sent31: In (McKee et al., 2023), the authors leveraged the pre-trained BLOOM-176B to generate natural languages descriptions of music given a set of music tags.
sent32: Subsequently, two distinct pre-trained models, namely CLIP and the D2T pipeline, were employed to initialize textual, video, and audio representations of the provided music content.
sent33: Following this, a transformerbased architecture model was fine-tuned for multimodal music recommendation."

These rules are designed to avoid spurious instances and keep the number of candidates to a minimum (Hasan and Ng, 2014). The main steps of the commonly used candidate keyphrases extraction methods for the recent unsupervised keyphrase extraction models are as follows, (1) tokenizing the document and tagging the document with partof-speech (POS) tags via the StanfordCoreNLP Tools 3 ; (2) extracting candidate phrases based on part-of-speech tags by the regular expression via the python package NLTK 4 . Furthermore, different pruning heuristics have been designed for pruning candidates that are unlikely to be keyphrases to obtain a better candidate set (Huang et al., 2006;Kumar and Srinathan, 2008;El-Beltagy and Rafea, 2009;Newman et al., 2012;You et al., 2009). After obtaining candidates, keyphrases are determined by estimating the importance of each candidate through various strategies. Here, to facilitate the introduction, we divide the methods of importance estimation into two categories, namely, traditional methods and embedding-based methods. Traditional unsupervised keyphrase extraction systems can be mainly divided into statistics-based (Jones, 2004;Campos et al., 2018b), topic-based (Liu et al., 2009;Jardine and Teufel, 2014), and graph-based (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;Wan and Xiao, 2008b;Bougouin et al., 2013;Florescu and Caragea, 2017b) methods. Generally, these models primarily use different features of documents (e.g., word frequency, position, linguistic properties, topic, length, the relationship between words, external knowledge-based information, etc.) to estimate the importance of each candidate phrase and discriminate whether a candidate phrase is a keyphrase (Hasan and Ng, 2014; Papagiannopoulou and Tsoumakas, 2019).

However, these traditional unsupervised models estimate the importance scores of candidate phrases based on the surface-level features, ignoring the high-level features (e.g., syntactic and semantic information) of natural languages, which leads to extract wrong keyphrases. Therefore, recent studies focus on embedding-based models (Wang et al., 2015;Mahata et al., 2018a;Papagiannopoulou and Tsoumakas, 2018;Sahrawat et al., 2020;Kulkarni et al., 2022;Song et al., 2022b), which leverage pretrained embeddings (containing high-level features) to obtain phrase and document embeddings and calculate the importance scores of candidate phrases for extracting keyphrases. Wang et al. (2015) is the first work to explore utilizing word embedding and frequency to generate weighted edges between words, then using the weighted PageRank algorithm to compute and rank candidate scores. Key2vec (Mahata et al., 2018a) proposes an effective way of processing text documents for training multi-word phrase embeddings that are used for topic representations of scientific articles and ranking of keyphrases extracted from them using the topic-weighted PageRank algorithm. Mahata et al. (2018b) uses a combination of theme-weighted personalized PageRank algorithm and neural phrase embeddings for extracting and ranking keyphrases. EmbedRank (Bennani-Smires et al., 2018) ranks candidate phrases by measuring the semantic similarity between each candidate phrase and document embeddings.

JointGL 6 (Liang et al., 2021) integrates boundary-aware phrase centrality (the semantic similarities are calculated between all candidate phrases for identifying which candidate is better) and phrase-document relevance (the semantic similarities are calculated between candidate phrases and their corresponding document) from both local and global views, then used both jointly to determine the importance of each candidate.

sent2: These rules are designed to avoid spurious instances and keep the number of candidates to a minimum (Hasan and Ng, 2014).
sent3: The main steps of the commonly used candidate keyphrases extraction methods for the recent unsupervised keyphrase extraction models are as follows, (1) tokenizing the document and tagging the document with partof-speech (POS) tags via the StanfordCoreNLP Tools 3 ; (2) extracting candidate phrases based on part-of-speech tags by the regular expression via the python package NLTK 4 .
sent4: Furthermore, different pruning heuristics have been designed for pruning candidates that are unlikely to be keyphrases to obtain a better candidate set (Huang et al., 2006;Kumar and Srinathan, 2008;El-Beltagy and Rafea, 2009;Newman et al., 2012;You et al., 2009).
sent5: After obtaining candidates, keyphrases are determined by estimating the importance of each candidate through various strategies.
sent6: Here, to facilitate the introduction, we divide the methods of importance estimation into two categories, namely, traditional methods and embedding-based methods.
sent7: Traditional unsupervised keyphrase extraction systems can be mainly divided into statistics-based (Jones, 2004;Campos et al., 2018b), topic-based (Liu et al., 2009;Jardine and Teufel, 2014), and graph-based (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;Wan and Xiao, 2008b;Bougouin et al., 2013;Florescu and Caragea, 2017b) methods.
sent8: Generally, these models primarily use different features of documents (e.g., word frequency, position, linguistic properties, topic, length, the relationship between words, external knowledge-based information, etc.) to estimate the importance of each candidate phrase and discriminate whether a candidate phrase is a keyphrase (Hasan and Ng, 2014; Papagiannopoulou and Tsoumakas, 2019).
sent9: However, these traditional unsupervised models estimate the importance scores of candidate phrases based on the surface-level features, ignoring the high-level features (e.g., syntactic and semantic information) of natural languages, which leads to extract wrong keyphrases.
sent10: Therefore, recent studies focus on embedding-based models (Wang et al., 2015;Mahata et al., 2018a;Papagiannopoulou and Tsoumakas, 2018;Sahrawat et al., 2020;Kulkarni et al., 2022;Song et al., 2022b), which leverage pretrained embeddings (containing high-level features) to obtain phrase and document embeddings and calculate the importance scores of candidate phrases for extracting keyphrases.
sent11: Wang et al. (2015) is the first work to explore utilizing word embedding and frequency to generate weighted edges between words, then using the weighted PageRank algorithm to compute and rank candidate scores.
sent12: Key2vec (Mahata et al., 2018a) proposes an effective way of processing text documents for training multi-word phrase embeddings that are used for topic representations of scientific articles and ranking of keyphrases extracted from them using the topic-weighted PageRank algorithm.
sent13: Mahata et al. (2018b) uses a combination of theme-weighted personalized PageRank algorithm and neural phrase embeddings for extracting and ranking keyphrases.
sent14: EmbedRank (Bennani-Smires et al., 2018) ranks candidate phrases by measuring the semantic similarity between each candidate phrase and document embeddings.
sent15: With the development of pre-trained language models (e.g., ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), and RoBERta ), SIFRank 5 (Sun et al., 2020b) improves candidate phrase and document embeddings from EmbedRank with the pre-trained language model ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and achieves better performance.
sent16: JointGL 6 (Liang et al., 2021) integrates boundary-aware phrase centrality (the semantic similarities are calculated between all candidate phrases for identifying which candidate is better) and phrase-document relevance (the semantic similarities are calculated between candidate phrases and their corresponding document) from both local and global views, then used both jointly to determine the importance of each candidate.

The objective is:

where L is the ranking loss as in Eq 1. Since negative pairs can be easily constructed by random sampling, the main difficulty is to design good heuristics for constructing positive pseudo pairs (q ′ , d ′+ ). There are 5 popular heuristics to construct such positive pairs: perturbation-based, summarybased, proximity-based, cooccurence-based and hyperlink-based. An overview is in Table 2.

Perturbation-based heuristics add perturbations to some text, then treat the perturbed text and the original text as a positive pair. The intuition is that perturbed text should still be relevant to the original text. Typical choices of perturbations include word deletion, substitution and permutation (Zhu et al., 2021b;Meng et al., 2021) (Ma et al., 2021a).

Proximity-based heuristics utilize the position information in the document to obtain positive pairs based on the intuition that nearby text should be more relevant to each other. The most famous one is the inverse-cloze task (Lee et al., 2019), where a sentence from a passage is treated as the question and the original passage, after removing the sentence, is treated as a positive document. They can be combined with typical noise injection methods like adding drop-out masks (Xu et al., 2022), random word chopping or deletion (Izacard et al., 2021) to further improve the model robustness. Other methods include using spans from the same document (Gao and Callan, 2022; Ma et al., 2022), sentences from the same paragraph, paragraphs from the same document as positive samples (Di Liello et al., 2022), etc.

Cooccurrence-based heuristics construct positive samples based on the intuition that sentences containing cooccurred spans are more likely to be relevant (Ram et al., 2021). For example, Glass et al. (2020) constructs a pseudo question with a sentence from the corpus. A term from it is treated as the answer and replaced with a special token. Passages retrieved with BM25 which also contains the answer term are treated as pseudo positive documents. Ram et al. (2022) treat a span and its surrounding context as the pseudo question and use another passage that contains the same span as a positive document.

Hyperlink-based heuristics leverage hyperlink information based on the intuition that hyperlinked text are more likely to be relevant . For example, Chang et al.

(2020) takes a sentence from the first section of a page p as a pseudo question because it is often the description or summary of the topic. A passage from another page containing hyperlinks to p is treated as a positive document. Yue et al. (2022a) replace an entity word with a question phrase like ""what/when"" to form a pseudo question. A passage from its hyperlinked document that contains the same entity word is treated as a positive sample. Zhou et al. (2022) build positive samples with two typologies: ""dual-link"" where two passages have hyperlinks pointed to each other, and ""co-mention"" where two passages both have a hyperlink to the same third-party document.

The cost of this relaxation is the increased difficulty of optimization. Approximating the joint likelihood from top-k samples becomes infeasible due to the combinatorial distribution of document. Singh et al. (2021) propose optimizating it with the EM algorithm under an independent assumption about the posterior distribution of R(z|q):

where SG means stop-gradient (gradients are not backpropagated through G). As can be seen, the training signal for the NR model is essentially the same as in the Top-k Approximation case, except that the reader is trained by conditioning on all top-k documents to generate the answer. Singh et al. (2021) also find that Eq 7 is quite robust with respect to parameter initialization. Similarly,  apply the hard-EM algorithm to train the NR model, which only treats documents with the highest likelihood estimated by the reader as positive. Izacard et al. (2022) further experiment with using the leave-one-out perplexity from the reader to supervise the ranker.

Learning from attention Another way to optimize the NR model in Eq 6 is to leverage attention scores from the reader G. The assumption is that when training G to generate the answer, its attention score is a good approximation of question-document relevance. The training objective is:

where G is trained to generate the right answer based on the question and the top-k document, same as in the EM algorithm. A z is the attention score of G on the document z. L is the loss function to encourage the similarity between distributions of the attention scores and retrieving scores.

Izacard and Grave (2021) propose a training process that optimizes R and G iteratively. R is trained to minimize KL divergence between relevance and attention scores. (Lee et al., 2021) jointly optimize R and G and apply a stop-gradient operation on G when updating R. Sachan et al. (2021) use retriever scores to bias attention scores on the contrary. These can be considered as first-order Taylor series approximations of Eq. 6 by replacing R(Z|q) with attention scores (Deng et al., 2018).

Discussion Training with latent-variable models can perform close to fully supervised models under certain scenarios Sachan et al., 2021). The main challenge is the training difficulty.

Top-k approximation A popular approach is to assume a categorical distribution for R(Z|q); that is, to assume for each question only a single document is selected and the answer is generated from that one document.

If the feedback model outputs numerical feedback (ĥ ϕ : X × Y → R) we can define an optimization problem similar to Equation 2. However, due to the limitations of feedback models as imperfect proxies, typically a regularization term R is introduced to avoid ""overfitting"" to the feedback model (Ziegler et al., 2019) (more on this at the end of this section):

(11) Due to the similarities between both optimization problems, approaches to tackle Equation 11 can be divided into two of the three categories in §4.2: joint-feedback modeling and reinforcement learning. Recall that while in §4.2 we discuss approaches for directly optimizing for human feedback, while this section is focused on cases where a model of human feedback is used instead.

Unlike when using human feedback directly, most works attempt to optimize for feedback models using reinforcement learning. Gao et al. (2018);Böhm et al. (2019) use the (numerical) feedback collected in other works to train reward and preference models, and use reinforcement learning to optimize against these models, showing that humans preferred their summarization model to other supervised and RL-trained baselines. Ziegler et al. (2019) proposed a similar approach, but trained preference models using feedback collected on the model being improved, and introduced a KL regularization term

to avoid the optimized model deviating too much from the original (supervised) model with parameters θ SL 4 . Stiennon et al. (2020) extended this work, by scaling both the summarization and preference models, showing that their model was highly preferred by humans, and generalized better than supervised baselines. Ouyang et al. (2022) also used reinforcement learning with preference models to improve the ability of LLMs to follow instructions, but combined the RL objective with the original pretraining objective to avoid performance regressions in public NLP benchmarks. Other works have also used reinforcement learning with preference models in a similar manner (Askell et al., 2021;Bai et al., 2022a;Wu et al., 2021;Nguyen et al., 2022). Underlying all these methods is that generally the model is first trained with imitation-learning on human demonstrations, which improves performance compared to using reinforcement learning directly on the pretrained policy. Glaese et al. (2022) compared doing feedbackbased imitation learning with human feedback ( §4.1) with doing reinforcement learning with a feedback model, finding that the latter led to a better preference rate and lower rule violation rate.

The joint-feedback modeling with feedback models was explored by , who study pre-training an LLMs with a loss similar to Equation 6, based on feedback from a preference model trained on ranking-based feedback for toxicity. They showed that this leads to models producing less toxic generations, when compared to pretraining a model with vanilla MLE.

However, they are heavily reliant on human input: for example, Gao et al. (2022) found that across various preference model sizes, utilizing fewer than 1,000 comparisons resulted in only minor improvements, with outcomes approximating chance. Moreover, employing static feedback can create consistency and accuracy challenges, as the integration of feedback leads to changes in the model's output distribution. AI-generated feedback, an emerging research area, focuses on harnessing the large language model's own abilities to evaluate and improve its output, enhancing the model without constant human intervention. Two primary approaches have emerged in this domain:

Self AI Feedback The first approach involves using the same model to provide feedback and improve its output. In this scenario, the model engages in a continuous self-improvement process, learning from its evaluations and refining its capabilities accordingly. Examples of this approach include prompting models to generate harmful responses and revising them for harmlessness (Bai et al., 2022b), or employing rule-based reward models for RLHF fine-tuning (OpenAI, 2023a). Techniques such as iterative output revision through few-shot prompting (Peng et al., 2023;Shinn et al., 2023;Paul et al., 2023;Madaan et al., 2023; have been explored using LLMs like GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a). Notably, these techniques demonstrate potential when applied to LLMs trained to adhere to human instructions and align outputs with human preferences. This suggests that incorporating human feedback during training equips AI models to comprehend task requirements better, align outputs with directives, and function as dependable feedback mechanisms, thereby minimizing human intervention. Intriguingly, the capacity to offer valuable AI feedback may depend on the model being trained with human feedback.

External AI Feedback: The second approach employs a separate model to provide feedback on the model's outputs which is being improved. In this setting, the task model is often paired with a separately trained feedback model (Yasunaga and Liang, 2020;Madaan et al., 2021;Welleck et al., 2022;Bai et al., 2022b;Akyürek et al., 2023).

In such cases, leveraging human feedback during decoding plays a critical role in enhancing LLMs's performance. This type of feedback, derived from interactions between LLMs and users in practical scenarios, enables models to learn from their errors and offers opportunities for ongoing refinement without altering model parameters. In addition, the feedback functions as a guiding mechanism, allowing the model to generate more desirable outputs by leveraging its existing capabilities.

There are two broad categories in which human feedback is used in this setup: 1. Feedback Memory: Feedback Memory Utilization involves maintaining a repository of feedback from prior sessions. Then, when processing new inputs, the system uses relevant feedback from similar inputs in its memory to guide the model toward generating more desirable outputs based on past experiences and user preferences. While a classical concept (Riesbeck, 1981;Schank, 1983), recent work has shown the promise of such a memoryaugmented approach in both finetuning (Weston et al., 2014;Wu et al., 2018; and few-shot setups .

2. Iterative Output Refinement: This method employs human feedback to refine the model's output iteratively. Users can provide feedback on intermediate responses, enabling the model to adjust its output until it meets the user's satisfaction. This process allows the model to better understand user preferences and produce more suitable outcomes (Reid and Neubig, 2022;Saunders et al., 2022;Schick et al., 2022;Nijkamp et al., 2022).

However, this requires the feedback to be ""optimizable"", i.e., possibly formulated as an optimization problem based on which we can obtain an improved model. For instance, if the feedback is a numerical score (f ∈ R), we can create the following optimization problem:

( 2) Where D is the distribution of possible inputs. Various techniques have been suggested to optimize the model parameters, θ, using the collected human feedback. These can be divided into three main categories based on the training mechanisms, which we will call feedback-based imitation learning, joint-feedback modeling, and reinforcement learning (RL).

The feedback-based imitation learning approach involves using human feedback to optimize the model by performing supervised learning with a dataset composed of positively-labeled generations together with the corresponding inputs, D + . This can be achieved by minimizing the loss:

An instance of this approach can be found in Li et al. (2017), in which the authors train a dialogue model by maximizing the likelihood of the model's answers labeled as correct by humans. Similarly, Kreutzer et al. (2018) trained a machine translation model on a set of positively-labeled translations, and Glaese et al. (2022) performed supervised learning on the preferred dialogues which comply with their pre-defined rules (concerning correctness, harmfulness, and helpfulness), according to humans. A slightly different approach was proposed by Hancock et al. (2019): deploying a chit-chat dialogue model and using the human utterances as targets to fine-tune the model. Scheurer et al. (2022Scheurer et al. ( , 2023 leverage the fact that LLMs can follow instructions and start by collecting natural language human feedback about the model generations, which often describes what an improved text would look like. Then, they ask the LM to generate multiple refinements based on the input, previous model generation, and the corresponding feedback. The highest similarity refinements for each generation are then used to finetune the LLM. OpenAI's text-davinci-002 was trained with both human demonstrations and model outputs with the highest possible rating, an approach deemed FeedME (OpenAI, 2023b). A downside of these approaches is that they disregard the generations which do not receive positive feedback, which may contain useful information to optimize the model. On the other hand, joint-feedback modeling leverages all the information collected by directly using human feedback to optimize the model. Also, as the feedback is modeled directly by the model, this approach allows feedback in formats other than numerical or ranking-based (e.g., natural language). Having D as the dataset of inputs x, generations y, and human feedback f collected, this can be achieved by minimizing the following loss of the form

Over all examples in D. These equation can be factorized as

. Some works simply train the model to predict the feedback given to each generation (Weston, 2016, forward prediction), disregarding the second term of the factorization. One example of this approach is the work of Li et al. (2017), in which the authors asked humans to give natural language feedback (e.g., positive/negative feedback, providing the correct answer to the model, or giving a hint about the correct answer) to a dialogue question answering model. Then, after having collected the feedback, the model is trained to predict it. Hancock et al. (2019) proposed having an auxiliary model predicting the satisfaction of the human speaking with the model. Then, if the satisfaction score is lower than a pre-defined threshold, the model will ask the human for feedback. The model then leverages the natural language feedback humans give by learning to predict it. Yuan et al. (2023); Rafailov et al. (2023) showed that having summarization models predict the rankings of different summaries helps the model generate better summaries, and might even outperform more complicated approaches using feedback models ( §5).

Other works train the model to predict the generations and the corresponding human feedback. Xu et al. (2022) proposed using the DIRECTOR model introduced by Arora et al. (2022) to leverage human feedback. As this model has a unified decoderclassifier architecture, Xu et al. (2022) proposed using positively-labeled examples to train its language modeling head (similarly to feedback-based imitation learning) and using both the positive and negatively-labeled examples to train a classifier head that directs the model away from generating undesirable sequences. Thoppilan et al. (2022a) follow this approach to enforce the model's quality and safety. First, they collect dialogues between crowd-workers and the proposed language model LaMDA, which are annotated with feedback provided by the crowd-workers. This feedback states each response's quality (sensible, specific, and interesting) or safety. Then, LaMDA is fine-tuned to predict the high-quality responses and the rewards given to every response regarding its quality attributes and safety. At inference time, LaMDA is also used to filter out candidate responses for which its safety prediction is below a threshold.

Finally, this can also be achieved by training the model to predict generation and conditioning on the feedback. This corresponds to minimizing the following loss: Liu et al. (2023) proposed prompt-based finetuning, where they create prompts containing previous generations rated by humans, in the order of preference. They also suggest inserting languagebased feedback (e.g., ""... is a worse answer than ..."") to the prompt, between the generations. Then, the model is fine-tuned to maximize the likelihood of generating the most preferred answer.

Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a more versatile approach, allowing for direct optimization of a model's parameters based on human feedback, regardless of the feedback's differentiability. A common RL algorithm used in this context is the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992), which updates the policy parameters using the following gradient:

(7) Here, D represents the set of inputs x, and p θ is the policy. This flexibility enables RL to handle various types of feedback and better align the generated output with human preferences. For instance, Kreutzer et al. (2018) proposed using task-based implicit feedback from user queries as a reward signal to train a machine translation model using a word-level variant of minimum risk training (Shen et al., 2016), while Jaques et al. (2019) used implicit human reactions in chat to improve open-domain dialog systems through off-policy Q-learning (Watkins and Dayan, 1992). Given that collecting human feedback can be expensive and time-consuming, learning is done offline from logged data, which is typically more favorable than on-policy settings that need feedback on the fly. Later in §5.2.1, we discuss several works that attempt to optimize feedback models using RL instead of directly optimizing human feedback.

This alignment objective has been studied extensively in the AI safety and alignment literature (Bostrom, 2014;Amodei et al., 2016;Bommasani et al., 2021). In addition, Kenton et al. (2021b) discuss some behavioral issues in language agents (natural language generation models) arising from a misspecified alignment objective (for example, from noisy labels in the training data), and Leike et al. (2018) proposed using feedback models to tackle the difficulty in specifying this objective.

Bai et al. (2022a) explicitly divided the problem of ""aligning"" a language model into improving its helpfulness and increasing its harmlessness. Most works implicitly consider either the use of feedback that targets performance factors (such as when targeting overall performance in a task or ability to follow instructions) or harmlessness factors (such as not producing toxic text or providing information that could lead to harm). 2

Helpfulness Most often, feedback is collected with some helpfulness objective in mind: a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a helpful system is that it performs the task well, and so feedback related to task performance generally falls under this umbrella. For example, most works in machine translation leverage feedback related to the quality of translation (Kreutzer et al., 2018;Fernandes et al., 2022), which is expected to be correlated with its helpfulness in downstream applications. Similarly, in summarization, most works leverage feedback related to aspects such as relevance, consistency and accuracy (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020) (in short, the quality of the summary). One particularly well-studied feedback objective is the ability to follow instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022): the task of instructionfollowing can encompass a wide range of other tasks, and using feedback to improve (instruction following) language assistants has been considered a benchmark for the alignment problem (Askell et al., 2021).

Harmlessness Another important alignment objective is harmlessness: we want our models not to produce certain types of output or violate certain norms. Feedback collected in Ouyang et al. (2022) considered aspects such as the toxicity of text (besides the overall ability to follow instructions). Bai et al. (2022a) explored the interaction between the helpfulness and harmlessness objectives, showing a trade-off between both. Thoppilan et al.

(2022) also ask humans to provide feedback on the harmlessness of their system, by defining a set of rules and asking humans if the outputs violate these rules. Bai et al. (2022b) showed that feedback produced by LLMs could increase harmlessness without reducing helpfulness.","[[None, 'b28'], [], ['b24', None, 'b69'], [None, 'b5', 'b69']]","[[None, 'b28'], [], ['b24', None, 'b69'], [None, 'b5', 'b69']]",8,"sent1: The purpose of collecting feedback is to align the model's behavior with some (often ill-defined) goal behavior: we might want our summarization model to generate summaries that contain all core information, even if it means they are a bit longer; in commercial machine translation, extra care is given to ensure that models do not mistranslate businesscritical information; and in dialogue agents, we might want the model to be able to produce polite and harmless responses.
sent2: This alignment objective has been studied extensively in the AI safety and alignment literature (Bostrom, 2014;Amodei et al., 2016;Bommasani et al., 2021).
sent3: In addition, Kenton et al. (2021b) discuss some behavioral issues in language agents (natural language generation models) arising from a misspecified alignment objective (for example, from noisy labels in the training data), and Leike et al. (2018) proposed using feedback models to tackle the difficulty in specifying this objective.
sent4: Bai et al. (2022a) explicitly divided the problem of ""aligning"" a language model into improving its helpfulness and increasing its harmlessness.
sent5: Most works implicitly consider either the use of feedback that targets performance factors (such as when targeting overall performance in a task or ability to follow instructions) or harmlessness factors (such as not producing toxic text or providing information that could lead to harm). 2Helpfulness Most often, feedback is collected with some helpfulness objective in mind: a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a helpful system is that it performs the task well, and so feedback related to task performance generally falls under this umbrella.
sent6: For example, most works in machine translation leverage feedback related to the quality of translation (Kreutzer et al., 2018;Fernandes et al., 2022), which is expected to be correlated with its helpfulness in downstream applications.
sent7: Similarly, in summarization, most works leverage feedback related to aspects such as relevance, consistency and accuracy (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020) (in short, the quality of the summary).
sent8: One particularly well-studied feedback objective is the ability to follow instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022): the task of instructionfollowing can encompass a wide range of other tasks, and using feedback to improve (instruction following) language assistants has been considered a benchmark for the alignment problem (Askell et al., 2021).
sent9: Harmlessness Another important alignment objective is harmlessness: we want our models not to produce certain types of output or violate certain norms.
sent10: Feedback collected in Ouyang et al. (2022) considered aspects such as the toxicity of text (besides the overall ability to follow instructions).
sent11: Bai et al. (2022a) explored the interaction between the helpfulness and harmlessness objectives, showing a trade-off between both.
sent12: Thoppilan et al. (2022b) collected feedback on whether their model violates a set of safety objectives and used it to finetune the model.
sent13: Glaese et al. (2022) also ask humans to provide feedback on the harmlessness of their system, by defining a set of rules and asking humans if the outputs violate these rules.
sent14: Bai et al. (2022b) showed that feedback produced by LLMs could increase harmlessness without reducing helpfulness."

feedback is in what format to collect this feedback in. The choice of format has implications on the expressivity of the feedback, the ease of its collection, and how we can use it to improve systems. In particular, the complexity of the feedback format is an important factor: simpler formats are often easier to collect and use as part of the training/decoding process, but contain less information than more ""complex"" formats, and might not be able to capture important information for improving the system. The choice of format also has implications in the difficulty for humans to give feedback, its consistency/agreement, and the level of rationality of said feedback (Ghosal et al., 2023). Types of feedback are summarized in Table 1 with examples.

Numerical Numerical feedback, which takes an input and output and returns a single score (X × Y → N ⊆ R), is one of the simplest feedback formats to collect and use. Kreutzer et al. (2018) studied using categorical feedback, in the form of 5 possible ""stars"" that can be assigned to a translation, which are then averaged to produce a score (N = [1, 5]) and used to improve the model.  and Shi et al. (2021) used even simpler feedback, by asking humans to choose if a given response is good or not (N = {0, 1}). Numerical feedback has also been extensively used for evaluation, albeit not with the explicit goal of improving generation. For example, direct assessments (Graham et al., 2013) in machine translation ask humans to rate translations on a continuous scale, and some works have attempted to use this feedback data to train feedback models (Sellam et al., 2020;Rei et al., 2020a) and improve generation (Freitag et al., 2022a;Fernandes et al., 2022).

Although easy to leverage, numerical feedback suffers from some limitations: depending on the complexity of the generation task, reducing feedback to a single score might generally be a hard and ill-defined task for humans, leading to a costly collection process and problems of subjectivity and variance (see §6.2.1). Furthermore, such feedback might not be suited to distinguish between outputs of similar quality.

Ranking-based An alternative to asking humans to assign a single score to a given input-output pair is asking them to rank multiple possible alternative outputs h : X × Y 1 × · · · × Y n → S n where S n represents the set of all permutations/rankings of n elements (optionally allowing ties). This has been used extensively in evaluation (Chaganty et al., 2018). Compared to numerical feedback, this format tends to be easier to collect, and, potentially, for this reason, ranking-based feedback tends to be collected to improve model behavior rather than just for evaluation (since the former tends to require more feedback data). Ziegler et al. (2019) and Stiennon et al. (2020) asked humans to rank alternative summaries of the system they are trying to improve. Similarly, Ouyang et al. (2022) collected rankings of alternative responses to an instruction given to the model. They utilized these rankings to enhance the model's instruction-following capabilities. Subsequent research has also employed ranking-based feedback for the same task (Askell et al., 2021;Bai et al., 2022a,b). Natural Language Both numerical and rankingbased feedback lack the ability to capture detailed information about problems with the output, which can be crucial for improving generation systems. Instead of asking humans to rank or score outputs, we can instead ask for natural language feedback. In such cases, the feedback typically provides more detailed information, either highlighting the shortcomings of the current output or suggesting specific actions for improvement. For example, Li et al. (2017) asked humans to give natural language feedback to a dialogue question answering model, including positive or negative feedback, but also possibly providing the correct answer to the model or hinting about it.  and  gather natural language feedback on errors present in model-generated graphs and the model's interpretation of a given instruction. Scheurer et al. (2022Scheurer et al. ( , 2023 improve summarization capabilities of language models by asking humans to provide natural language feedback of summaries of the model. Li et al. (2022) collect natural language feedback (in addition to numerical feedback) for responses from a Question Answering (QA) system.

Others Besides these feedback types, other (potentially domain-specific) types of feedback can be used to improve model behavior. Commonly humans are asked to provide multi-aspect feedback (X × Y → R d or F d more generally), scoring an output or ranking multiple outputs with respect to multiple dimensions (Böhm et al., 2019;Glaese et al., 2022;Madaan et al., 2023;Nguyen et al., 2022). Post-editions ask humans to provide corrections to the output in the form of small edits (e.g., replace X by Y), and post-edition data has been used to directly improve models (Denkowski et al., 2014) or train automatic post edition systems that correct model mistakes (Pal et al., 2016;Mehta and Goldwasser, 2019;Madaan et al., 2021;Talmor et al., 2020;Elgohary et al., 2021). There are also other feedback types that haven't been fully leveraged to improve generation: e.g., Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) (Lommel et al., 2014b), the standard for evaluating translation quality, asks professional translators to identify errors spans in a translation, alongside severity and type of error.","[[], ['b3'], ['b80', 'b9', 'b24', 'b76', None, 'b60'], [], ['b72', 'b30', 'b29', None, 'b87', 'b71'], ['b5', 'b38', 'b37', None, 'b35', 'b40', 'b90', 'b42']]","[[], ['b3'], ['b80', 'b9', 'b24', 'b76', None, 'b60'], [], ['b72', 'b30', 'b29', None, 'b87', 'b71'], ['b5', 'b38', 'b37', None, 'b35', 'b40', 'b90', 'b42']]",21,"sent1: An important decision to make when we want to improve language generation systems through human Example input and output for three tasks (machine translation, summarization, and instruction following) and possible different (example) feedback that can be given.feedback is in what format to collect this feedback in.

Although these models may not be perfect, they offer the advantage of providing feedback at a low cost after training, thereby enabling the scaling of feedback-dependent techniques. More formally, given a feedback function h : X × Y 1 × · · · × Y n → F, we want to learn a parametric (numerical) feedback modelĥ ϕ : X × Y → R (with parameters ϕ) that ""agrees"" with human feedback. This agreement is expressed through a loss function, and the model is trained to minimize this agreement loss:

L(ϕ) = loss ĥ ϕ (x, y 1 ), · · · , h(x, y 1:n )

For example, if the feedback function we are trying to model is also numerical (h : X × Y → R), then this loss can just be any standard regression loss, such as the squared difference between the human feedback and model feedback L(ϕ) = ĥ ϕ (x, y) − h(x, y) 2 . Importantly, while the feedback model is (generally) numerical, the human feedback can be in any other format, as long as a suitable loss function can be specified. Stiennon et al. (2020) train preference models 3ĥ ϕ (x, y n ) on ranking-based feedback, using a loss of the form L(ϕ) = log σ ĥ ϕ (x, y +1 ) −ĥ ϕ (x, y −1 )

(10) such that sample y +1 was preferred to y −1 for the same input x: h(x, y −1 , y +1 ) = (y −1 < y +1 ). Variants of this loss have subsequently been used in other works (Ouyang et al., 2022;Askell et al., 2021;Qin et al., 2022;Yuan et al., 2023).

The problem of feedback modeling has been studied extensively in the context of metric learning for NLP. Zhang et al. (2019) and Zhou et al. (2023b) utilized pre-trained masked LMs to compute similarity scores between the generated text or code snippets and their references. In MT, Sellam et al. (2020) and Rei et al. (2020a) trained BLEURT and COMET, respectively, to regress on human quality assessments of translation quality. For summarization, Zopf (2018) leveraged annotated pairwise preferences to train a preference model and Peyrard et al. (2017) learned a summary-level metric from a set of human judgements included in older summarization datasets (e.g., TAC-2008). These metrics have been shown to correlate much better with human judgments than widely used lexical-metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE (Freitag et al., 2022b). It is notable that these reward models were not trained with the intent of improving generation directly, although some of them were used for that purpose later, as discussed in §5.2.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing feedback models directly with the aim of using them to improve generation (Böhm et al. Next, the feedback model is finetuned on a dataset of human feedback. This dataset is typically collected by asking annotators to provide feedback on outputs from an earlier version of the model being improved. However, it is also possible to first finetune the feedback model on naturally occurring implicit feedback, such as from user interactions on websites (e.g., Reddit, StackOverflow). Though less accurate than explicitly-collected feedback, it allows feedback models to be trained on much more data. Askell et al. (2021) found that naturally occurring feedback data benefits models larger than 1B parameters, but often has diminishing returns when the number of explicit-collected feedback increases. Nguyen et al. (2022) train a preference model based on rankings on three human-designed objectives: whether the summary has an appropriate topic, length, and quality, combining these three into a single objective using a distance-based ranking loss. Interestingly, automatic post-editing (APE) systems in MT (e.g., Simard et al.

To illustrate this task visually, we provide a Python programming problem as an example in Figure 1, while different NL2Code benchmarks may vary in terms of language or 2 We summarize the related surveys in Appendix A.  problem domain. Existing large language models for the NL2Code task are usually based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and are trained on a large-scale code related unlabelled corpus. For better code generation performance, most LLMs, no matter encoder-decoder or decoder-only models, employ the causal language modeling objective for training, which is to predict the token following a sequence of tokens. During inference, an LLM can tackle NL2Code problems in a zero-shot manner without fine-tuning its parameters. There are also studies employing few-shot (Austin et al., 2021) or in-context learning (Nijkamp et al., 2023) to further boost the performance. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of 27 representative LLMs for the NL2Code task. Details of each model are summarized in Table 1, where models vary in architecture, size, and accessibility. For better visualization, we present these models in chronological order in Figure 2, plotting the largest model sizes. One trend observed is that these large language models are consistently growing in size as the research field advances. Additionally, the decoder-only architecture is favoured for pre-trained models with larger sizes.

Early works, such as GPT-C (Svyatkovskiy et al., 2020), PyMT5 (Clement et al., 2020), and PLBART (Ahmad et al., 2021), have relatively small numbers of parameters and do not demonstrate strong capabilities in zero-shot code generation. Conversely, large-scale models such as GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021) and GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), despite their billion-level parameter scale, have been found to have limited power in the NL2Code task due to the small amount of code in their training corpus. Recently, a number of powerful LLMs have been proposed for NL2Code, such as Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), andPaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022), which possess massive parameter scales and high-quality training corpus with code. While they show surprisingly good performance on NL2Code, most of them are not readily accessible. At present, a number of excellent open-source models have also been proposed, including CodeParrot (Huggingface, 2021), PolyCoder , GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), and San-taCoder (Allal et al., 2023), which contribute to the thriving of LLMs for NL2Code. Besides, recent studies have proposed various approaches to address specific NL2Code scenarios. For example, JuPyT5 (Chandel et al., 2022a) is designed to work within Jupyter Notebooks, while ERNIE-Code (Chai et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), andBLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) are trained to support multiple natural or programming languages. Additionally, InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), FIM (Bavarian et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023) not only support left-to-right code prediction, but also allow for infilling arbitrary regions of code. As LLMs for NL2Code are evolving rapidly, we created a website to keep up-to-date with the latest advances by crowd-sourcing. Details of the website can be found in Appendix B.

These models are not only attractive in academia (Chen et al., 2021;Nijkamp et al., 2023;Li et al., 2022b), but also applied in real-world products to improve programming efficiency (Sobania et al., 2022a;Barke et al., 2023). One example is GitHub and OpenAI's Copilot, a programming assistance tool that utilizes Codex to provide realtime code suggestions. Other notable products include CodeGeeX 3 and CodeWhisperer 4 . A summary of 10 products can be found in Appendix Table 5. Recent studies (Sobania et al., 2022b;Pearce et al., 2022;Nguyen and Nadi, 2022) have shown that these products can provide helpful recommendations, while they also introduce minor bugs that can cause issues for users.

In this section, we provide a brief overview of current benchmarks and metrics, as well as our observations and the open challenges.

We summarize 17 well-studied NL2Code benchmarks in Table 3, where we can find that each of these benchmarks has its own characteristics regarding size, language, complexity, and scenario. We observe that most benchmarks contain a limited number of instances. For example, the widely used HumanEval and MBPP have 164 and 974 instances, respectively. This is because these benchmarks are typically hand-written to ensure that LLMs have not seen them during training. In the era of large language models, it is crucial to avoid data leak-age when creating new benchmarks. Additionally, most current benchmarks have their problem descriptions in English and code solutions in Python.

Recently, several multi-lingual benchmarks have been proposed, such as MBXP (Athiwaratkun et al., 2022), HumanEvalX (Zheng et al., 2023), and Mul-tiPL (Cassano et al., 2022), which cover multiple programming languages, and ODEX (Wang et al., 2022c), which covers multiple natural languages. Details of multi-lingual benchmarks are listed in Appendix Table 7. Furthermore, benchmarks have been proposed for other practical scenarios, such as data science (Lai et al., 2022), public library (Zan et al., 2022b), private library (Zan et al., 2022a), multi-turn program synthesis (Nijkamp et al., 2023), and code security (Siddiq and msiddiq, 2022). For execution-based benchmarks, comprehensive test cases with complete coverage of the generated program can ensure the trustworthiness of evaluation results. As a reference, the average number of test cases for each benchmark, as well as the length statistics of the problem descriptions and solutions are also provided in Table 3.

Manually evaluating the generated code is impractical, which calls for the need for automatic metrics. The above mentioned benchmarks all provide test cases for execution-based evaluation, where metrics such as pass@k (Chen et al., 2021), n@k (Li et al., 2022b), test case aver-age (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and execution accuracy (Rajkumar et al., 2022) can be used. However, this approach has stringent requirements for the quality of test cases and can only evaluate executable code. For non-executable code, metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), andCodeBLEU (Ren et al., 2020) are used, while they can not precisely evaluate the correctness of the code.

Despite this progress, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, offering ample opportunities for further research and applications. In this section, we explore the challenges and opportunities in terms of the ability gap between LLMs and humans.

Understanding Ability The inherent flexibility of natural language allows for a variety of expressions to convey functional requirements. Humans are able to understand various descriptions at different levels of abstraction. In contrast, current LLMs tend to be sensitive to the given context, which may cause unexpected performance degradation . In addition, LLMs may struggle when faced with complex problems that have numerous conditions and requirements (Barke et al., 2022;Imai, 2022). We believe exploring the understanding abilities of LLMs is a crucial research direction. One potential solution is to break down complex problems into multiple steps, as is commonly done in reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022).

Judgement Ability Humans have the ability to determine whether they can solve a programming problem or not. While current models will always return a solution even if there is no answer to the problem, due to the fact that they are trained by unsupervised causal language modeling objective. This can cause problems in practical applications. To improve the judgment ability of LLMs, researchers have employed reinforcement learning to leverage user feedback, as seen in models like InstructGPT  and ChatGPT 8 . However, collecting high-quality feedback for code is costly and challenging. There are also ongoing studies (Chen et al., 2023;Key et al., 2022) exploring the possibility of self-validation for LLMs, which is also a promising research direction.

Explanation Ability It is widely acknowledged that human developers possess the ability to interpret the meaning of the code they write, which is crucial for educational purposes and software maintenance. Recent studies showed that LLMs have the potential to automatically generate code explanations. MacNeil et al. (2022a) proposed using LLMs to generate code explanations for students during their learning process, and MacNeil et al. (2022b) proposed explaining numerous aspects of a given code snippet using Copilot. Further research and explorations are necessary to fully realize the potential of LLMs in this regard.

Adaptive Learning Ability A fundamental difference between current large language models and humans is their ability to adapt to new and updated knowledge. Human developers possess a unique ability to quickly search and learn new materials, such as programming documentation, and adapt to changes in APIs with relative ease. However, re-training or fine-tuning LLMs requires significant effort and resources. This issue has inspired a number of recent studies, such as DocCoder  and APICoder (Zan et al., 2022a), which utilize retrieval-based methods to provide extra or updated knowledge during model inference. Despite these advancements, it remains an open challenge to endow LLMs with the powerful learning capabilities humans possess.

Multi-tasking Ability Large language models have been applied to a variety of code-related tasks, such as code repair (Joshi et al., 2022; Prenner and Robbes, 2021), code search (Neelakantan et al., 2022), and code review (Li et al., 2022c) as well as non-code tasks that can be formatted in a code-like manner, such as mathematics (Drori and Verma, 2021; Drori et al., 2021) and chemistry (Krenn et al., 2022;Hocky and White, 2022). However, there are differences between LLMs and human abilities in terms of multi-tasking. Humans can seamlessly switch between tasks, while LLMs may require sophisticated prompt engineering (Liu et al., 2023). Another evidence is that LLMs lack the ability to quickly master multiple programming languages (Zheng et al., 2023) as humans do. These limitations highlight areas for future research.

In this paper, we survey 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and draw a thorough analysis of the underlying reasons for their success. We also provide a detailed review of benchmarks and metrics. Regarding the gap between models and humans, we present ongoing challenges and opportunities.

• Accuracy of ZP Recovery: this aims to measure model performance on detecting and predicting ZPs of sentences in one pro-drop language. For instance, the micro F1-score is used to evaluating Chinese ZPR systems Song et al. (2020). 11 • General Translation Quality: there are a number of automatic evaluation metrics for measuring general performance of MT systems (Snover  Table 4: Correlation between the manual evaluation and other automatic metrics, which are applied on different ZPT benchmarks, which are same as in Table 2. et al., 2006). BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is the most widely-used one, which measures the precision of n-grams of the MT output compared to the reference, weighted by a brevity penalty to punish overly short translations. ME-TEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) incorporates semantic information by calculating either exact match, stem match, or synonymy match.

Modeling ZPs for advanced NMT models, however, has received more attention, resulting in better performance in this field (Wang et al., 2018a;Tan et al., 2021;Hwang et al., 2021). Generally prior works fall into three categories: (1) Pipeline, where input sentences are labeled with ZPs using an external ZP recovery system and then fed into a standard MT model (Chung and Gildea, 2010;Wang et al., 2016a); (2) Implicit, where ZP phenomenon is implicitly resolved by modelling document-level contexts Ri et al., 2021); (3) Endto-End, where ZP prediction and translation are jointly learned in an end-to-end manner Tan et al., 2021).

Pipeline The pipeline method of ZPT borrows from that in pronoun translation (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010;Pradhan et al., 2012) due to the strong relevance between the two tasks. Chung and Gildea (2010) systematically examine the effects of empty category (EC) 9 on SMT with pattern-, CRF-and parsing-based methods. The results show that this can really improve the translation quality, even though the automatic prediction of EC is not highly accurate. Besides, Wang et al. (2016aWang et al. ( ,b, 2017b proposed to integrate neural-based ZP recovery with SMT systems, showing better performance on both ZP recovery and overall translation. When entering the era of NMT, ZP recovery is also employed as an external system. Assuming that no-pro-drop languages can benefit pro-drop ones, Ohtani et al. (2019) tagged the coreference information in the source language, and then encoded it using a graph-based encoder integrated with NMT model. Tan et al. (2019) recovered ZP in the source sentence via a BiLSTM-CRF model (Lample et al., 2016). Different from the conventional ZP recovery methods, the label is the corresponding translation of ZP around with special tokens. They then trained a NMT model on this modified data, letting the model learn the copy behaviors. Tan et al. (2021) used ZP detector to predict the ZP position and inserted a special token. Second, they used a attention-based ZP recovery model to recover the ZP word on the corresponding ZP position.

End-to-End Due the lack of training data on ZPT, a couple of studies pay attention to data augmentation. Sugiyama and Yoshinaga (2019) employed the back-translation on a context-aware NMT model to augment the training data. With the help of context, the pronoun in no-pronoun-drop language can be translated correctly into pronoundrop language. They also build a contrastive dataset to filter the pseudo data. Besides, Kimura et al.

(2019) investigated the selective standards in detail to filter the pseudo data. Ri et al. (2021) deleted the personal pronoun in the sentence to augment the training data. And they trained a classifier to keep the sentences that pronouns can be recovered without any context. About model architecture, Wang et al. (2018a) first proposed a reconstruction-based approach to reconstruct the ZP-annotated source sentence from the hidden states of either encoder or decoder, or both. The central idea behind is to guide the corresponding hidden states to embed the recalled source-side ZP information and subsequently to help the NMT model generate the missing pronouns with these enhanced hidden representations. Although this model achieved significant improvements, there nonetheless exist two drawbacks: 1) there is no interaction between the two separate reconstructors, which misses the opportunity to exploit useful relations between encoder and decoder representations; and 2) testing phase needs an external ZP prediction model and it only has an accuracy of 66% in F1-score, which propagates numerous errors to the translation model. Thus, Wang et al. (2018b) further proposed to improve the reconstruction-based model by using shared reconstructor and joint learning. Furthermore, relying on external ZP models in decoding makes these approaches unwieldy in practice, due to introducing more computation cost and complexity.

About learning objective, contrastive learning is often used to let the output more close to golden data while far away from negative samples. Yang et al. (2019b) proposed a contrastive learning to reduce the word omitted error. To construct the negative samples, they randomly dropped the word by considering its frequency or part-of-speech tag. Hwang et al. (2021) further considered the coreference information to construct the negative sample. According to the coreference information, they took place the antecedent in context with empty, mask or random token to get the negative samples. Besides, Jwalapuram et al. (2020) served the pronoun mistranslated output as the negative samples while golden sentences as positive sample. To get the negative samples, they aligned the word between model outputs and golden references to get the sentences with mistranslated pronoun.

Implicit Some works consider not just the ZPT issue but rather focus on the overall discourse problem. The document-level NMT models (Wang et al., 2017a;Werlen et al., 2018;Ma et al., 2020;Lopes et al., 2020) are expected to have strong capabilities in discourse modelling such as translation consistency and ZPT. Another method is the round-trip translation, which is commonly-used in automatic post-editing (APE) (Freitag et al., 2019), quality estimation (QE) (Moon et al., 2020) to correct of detect the translation errors. Voita et al. (2019) served this idea on context-aware NMT to correct the discourse error in the output. They employed the round-trip translation on monolingual data to get the parallel corpus in the target language. They then used the corpus to train a model to repair discourse phenomenon in MT output.  proposed a fully unified ZPT model, which absolutely released the reliance on external ZP models at decoding time.

Earlier works investigated rich features using traditional ML models (Zhao and Ng, 2007;Kong and Zhou, 2010;Chen andNg, 2013, 2015). Recent studies exploited neural models to achieve the better performance (Chen and Ng, 2016;Yin et al., 2018;Song et al., 2020). The CoNLL2011 and CoNLL2012 2 are commonlyused benchmarks on modeling unrestricted coreference. The corpus contains 144K coreference instances, but dropped subjects only occupy 15%.

Zero Pronoun Recovery Given a source sentence, this aims to insert omitted pronouns in proper positions without changing the original meaning (Yang and Xue, 2010;Yang et al., 2015Yang et al., , 2019a. It is different from ZP resolution, which identifies the antecedent of a referential pronoun (Mitkov, 2014). Previous studies regarded ZP recovery as a classification or sequence labelling problem, which only achieve 40∼60% F1 scores on closed datasets Song et al., 2020), indicating the difficulty of generating ZPs.

In § 2.3, we discussed Siamese-BERT networks as presented in Reimers and Gurevych (2019). There are two noteworthy components to this model. First, processing inputs individually without promoting interaction between words; second, using an encoder like BERT that is not generative as its backbone model. The first component is computationally efficient but has been found to result in poorer performance compared to methods that promote interaction between words (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). This lack of interaction can limit the network's ability to capture the nuances of language, and may result in less accurate sentence embeddings.

In some studies, the stimuli are single words (Mitchell et al., 2008;Anderson et al., 2017) or sentences displayed on a screen (Pereira et al., 2018). In others, participants read longer stories (Wehbe et al., 2014a;Bhattasali et al., 2020;Nastase et al., 2021) or listened to speech or podcasts (Huth et al., 2016;Antonello et al., 2021). Table 1 lists publicly available datasets that have been used in the context of mapping language models to and from recordings of brain response. Differences between the datasets -the number of participants, the equipment, the experimental setup, pre-processing steps, and probabilistic corrections -should lead us to expect some variation in what researchers have concluded (Hollenstein et al., 2020).

3 How to predict brain activity?

In this section, we survey work in which neural responses are predicted from linguistic representations. Such work typically aims to shed light on how language functions in the brain. One of the earliest studies exploring the mapping between brain and language representations is by Mitchell et al. (2008), who trained a linear regression model on a set of word representations extracted from 60 nouns using 115 semantic features based on cooccurrence statistics, to predict the corresponding fMRI representations of the same nouns. They use pair-wise matching accuracy evaluation, extracting two words w and w ′ for evaluation, and showed that the predicted fMRI for a word w was closer to the real fMRI image for w than to the real fMRI image for w ′ , at above-chance levels. Mitchell et al. (2008) also report percentile rank results, ranking predicted fMRI images by similarity with the real image of w. We discuss how the metrics relate in §6.

The dataset of Mitchell et al. (2008)is also used by Murphy et al. (2012), who extract linguistic features from part-of-speech taggers, stemmers, and dependency parsers, showing that dependency parsers are the most successful in predicting brain activity. They also use leave-2-out pair-matching as their performance metric.

Later on, Wehbe et al. (2014a) moved on to predicting brain activation patterns for entire sentences rather than for isolated words. They recorded fMRI neural response measurements while participants read a chapter from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then extracted a set of 195 features for each word (ranging from semantic, syntactic properties to visual and discourse-level features) to train a comprehensive generative model that would then predict the time series of the fMRI activity observed when the participants read that passage. Leave-2-out pair-matching accuracy is used for evaluation. Huth et al. (2016), in contrast, use fMRI recordings of participants listening to spoken narrative stories, representing each word in the corpus as a 985-dimensional vector encoding semantic information driven by co-occurrence statistics. They train per-voxel linear regression models and evaluate their predicted per-word fMRI images by their per-voxel Pearson correlation with the real fMRI images, showing that 3-4 dimensions explained a significant amount of variance in the FMRI data. Wehbe et al. (2014b) are among the first to use neural language models, using recurrent models to compute contextualized embeddings, hidden state vectors of previous words, and word probabilities.  of participants reading Harry Potter, obtained in a follow-up study to Wehbe et al. (2014a). From the three sets of representations, they then train linear regression models to predict the MEG vectors corresponding to each word, and the regression models are then evaluated by computing pair-matching accuracy.

Similarly, Søgaard (2016) evaluates static word embeddings on the data from Wehbe et al. (2014a), learning linear transformation from word embeddings into an fMRI vector space. The predictions are evaluated through mean squared error (MSE).

Jain and Huth (2018) evaluate recurrent language models against the fMRI dataset from Huth et al. (2016). Their findings show that contextual language model representations align significantly better (to brain response) compared to static word embedding models. Their evaluation metric is the total sum of explained variance 1 Following this, Schwartz et al. (2019) use attention-based transformer language models for brain mapping. They finetune BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)to predict neural response measurements from the Harry Potter dataset, showing that the fine-tuned models have representations that encode more brain-activity-relevant language information than the non-finetuned models. They rely on pair-matching accuracy as their performance metric.

As in Søgaard (2016), Zhang et al. (2020) map static word embeddings into the vector space of the neural response measurements (fMRI). They introduce a new dataset of such measurements from subjects listening to natural stories. They rely on explained variance as their performance metric.

Toneva and Wehbe (2019) evaluate word and sequence embeddings from 4 recurrent and attention-based transformer language models, using the Harry Potter fMRI dataset. They evaluate models across layers, context lengths, and attention types, using pairwise matching accuracy as their performance metric. In a later study, Toneva et al. (2022a) induce compositional semantic representations of ""supra-word meaning"" which they then use to predict neural responses across regions of interest, evaluating their models using Pearson correlation.

Also using the Harry Potter data,  evaluate five models, one static and four contextualized, relying on a variant of representational similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008). The results suggest that models provide representations of local contexts that are well-aligned to neural measurements. However, as information from further away context is integrated by the models, representations become less aligned to neural measurements.

In a large-scale study, Schrimpf et al. (2021) examine the relationships between 43 diverse stateof-the-art neural network models (including embedding models, recurrent models, and transformers) across three datasets (two fMRI, one electrocardiography). They rely on a metric they term Brain Score which involves normalising the Pearson correlation by a noise ceiling. Their results show that transformer-based models perform better than recurrent or static models, and larger models perform better than smaller ones.

Similarly, in , the Schoffelen et al. (2019) fMRI and MEG datasets are used to compare a variety of transformer architectures. They study how architectural details, training settings, and the linguistic performance of these models independently account for the generation of brain correspondent representations. The results suggest that the better language models are at predicting words from context, the better their activations linearly map onto those of the brain. Antonello et al. (2021) evaluate three static and five attention-based transformer models, in combination with four fine-tuning tasks and two machine translation models. They train linear regression models to evaluate their word-level representations against a new fMRI dataset from participants listening to podcast stories. They find a low-dimensional structure in language representations that can predict brain responses. In a similar setting, Antonello and Huth (2022) examine why some features fit the brain data better arguing that the reason is that they capture various linguistic phenomena.

Reddy and Wehbe (2021) evaluate syntactic features in conjunction with BERT representations, finding that syntax explains additional variance in brain activity in various parts of the language system, even while controlling for complexity metrics that capture processing load.

In a series of studies Caucheteux et al. (2021Caucheteux et al. ( , 2022b investigate GPT2's activations in predicting brain signals using the Nastase et al. (2021) dataset. Their evaluation metric is Brain Score (Schrimpf et al., 2018). To determine which factors affect the brain encoding Pasquiou et al. (2022) examine the impact of test loss, training corpus, model architecture, and fine-tuning in various models using the Li et al. (2022) dataset. They evaluate model performance using Pearson Correlation.

Oota et al. (2022a) study the impact of context size in language models on how they align with neural response measurements. They use the Nastase et al. (2021) dataset and evaluate recurrent and attention-based transformer architectures. In a later study, Oota et al. (2022b) use the Pereira et al. (2018) dataset and evaluate BERTbase models (fine-tuned for various NLP tasks). They showed that neural response predictions from ridge regression with BERT-base models fine-tuned for coreference resolution, NER, and shallow syntactic parsing explained more variance for Pereira et al. (2018) response measurements. On the other hand, tasks such as paraphrase generation, summarization, and natural language inference led to better encoding performance for the Nastase et al. (2021) data (audio). Using the same dataset, in Oota et al. (2022c) it is shown that the presence of surface, syntactic, and semantic linguistic information is crucial for the alignment across all layers of the language model. They use pairwise matching accuracy and/or Pearson correlation as their performance metrics in these studies.

Aw and Toneva (2023) extract feature representations from four attention-based transformer models. They evaluate the impact of fine-tuning on the BookSum dataset (Kryscinski et al., 2021). All models are used to predict brain activity on the Harry Potter data. Pairwise matching accuracy and Pearson correlation are their performance metrics. Merlin and Toneva (2022) focus more narrowly on variants of GPT-2, showing that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are probably not because of the next-word prediction task or wordlevel semantics, but due to multi-word semantics. Their reported metric is Pearson correlation.

Intermediate summary The above studies differ in many respects. Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, 2 Pearson correlation (or Brain Score), mean squared error, and representational similarity analysis. Even studies that report the same performance metrics are not directly comparable because they often report on results on different datasets and use slightly different protocols, e.g., Murphy et al. (2012) and Wehbe et al. (2014b). Beinborn et al. (2023) compare various encoding experiments and receive very diverse results for different evaluation metrics. The diversity of metrics and data renders a direct comparison difficult. To remedy this, we consider how the metrics compare in §6.","[['b22', 'b10', 'b5', 'b25', 'b3', 'b27', 'b50', 'b40', 'b67'], [], ['b40'], ['b40', 'b41'], ['b27', 'b68', 'b67'], ['b59', 'b67'], [None, 'b17'], ['b69'], ['b63'], ['b31'], ['b56'], [None, 'b5'], [], ['b14', 'b23', 'b12', 'b57', 'b22', 'b48'], ['b45', 'b50', 'b22'], ['b32', 'b34'], ['b68', 'b8', 'b41']]","[['b22', 'b10', 'b5', 'b25', 'b3', 'b27', 'b50', 'b40', 'b67'], [], ['b40'], ['b40', 'b41'], ['b27', 'b68', 'b67'], ['b59', 'b67'], [None, 'b17'], ['b69'], ['b63'], ['b31'], ['b56'], [None, 'b5'], [], ['b14', 'b23', 'b12', 'b57', 'b22', 'b48'], ['b45', 'b50', 'b22'], ['b32', 'b34'], ['b68', 'b8', 'b41']]",39,"sent1: To infer a mapping between language models and brains, researchers rely on datasets in which brain activity is recorded in response to linguistic stimuli.

sent6: 3 How to predict brain activity?
sent7: In this section, we survey work in which neural responses are predicted from linguistic representations.
sent8: Such work typically aims to shed light on how language functions in the brain.
sent9: One of the earliest studies exploring the mapping between brain and language representations is by Mitchell et al. (2008), who trained a linear regression model on a set of word representations extracted from 60 nouns using 115 semantic features based on cooccurrence statistics, to predict the corresponding fMRI representations of the same nouns.
sent10: They use pair-wise matching accuracy evaluation, extracting two words w and w ′ for evaluation, and showed that the predicted fMRI for a word w was closer to the real fMRI image for w than to the real fMRI image for w ′ , at above-chance levels.
sent11: Mitchell et al. (2008) also report percentile rank results, ranking predicted fMRI images by similarity with the real image of w. We discuss how the metrics relate in §6.
sent12: The dataset of Mitchell et al. (2008)is also used by Murphy et al. (2012), who extract linguistic features from part-of-speech taggers, stemmers, and dependency parsers, showing that dependency parsers are the most successful in predicting brain activity.
sent13: They also use leave-2-out pair-matching as their performance metric.Later on, Wehbe et al. (2014a) moved on to predicting brain activation patterns for entire sentences rather than for isolated words.
sent14: They recorded fMRI neural response measurements while participants read a chapter from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then extracted a set of 195 features for each word (ranging from semantic, syntactic properties to visual and discourse-level features) to train a comprehensive generative model that would then predict the time series of the fMRI activity observed when the participants read that passage.
sent15: Leave-2-out pair-matching accuracy is used for evaluation.
sent16: Huth et al. (2016), in contrast, use fMRI recordings of participants listening to spoken narrative stories, representing each word in the corpus as a 985-dimensional vector encoding semantic information driven by co-occurrence statistics.
sent17: They train per-voxel linear regression models and evaluate their predicted per-word fMRI images by their per-voxel Pearson correlation with the real fMRI images, showing that 3-4 dimensions explained a significant amount of variance in the FMRI data.
sent18: Wehbe et al. (2014b) are among the first to use neural language models, using recurrent models to compute contextualized embeddings, hidden state vectors of previous words, and word probabilities.
sent19: of participants reading Harry Potter, obtained in a follow-up study to Wehbe et al. (2014a).
sent20: From the three sets of representations, they then train linear regression models to predict the MEG vectors corresponding to each word, and the regression models are then evaluated by computing pair-matching accuracy.

They evaluate static word embeddings by applying ridge regression to predict per-word fMRI vectors. A separate regression model is trained per dimension, allowing for dimension-wise regularization. The model is evaluated in terms of pairwise matching accuracy, but also in terms of percentile rank, adapted to the decoding scenario.

Gauthier and Levy (2019) also train linear regression models which map from the response measurements in Pereira et al.

The regression models are evaluated using two metrics: mean squared error and average percentile rank. Their results show that fine-tuning with different NLU objectives leads to worse alignment and that, somewhat surprisingly, the only objective which does lead to better alignment is a scrambled language modeling task where the model is trained to predict scrambled sentences.

Minnema and Herbelot (2019) re-examine the work of Pereira et al. (2018) using various metrics (pairwise matching accuracy, percentile rank, cosine distance, R 2 , RSA), comparing decoder models (ridge regression, perceptron, and convolutional neural networks). 3 They show that positive results are only obtained using pairwise matching accuracy. Abdou et al. (2021) investigate whether aligning language models with brain recordings can be improved by biasing their attention with annotations from syntactic or semantic formalisms. They fine-tune the BERT models using several syntactosemantic formalisms and evaluate their alignment with brain activity measurements from the Wehbe et al. (2014a) and Pereira et al.

See Table 2 for a summary of metrics and corresponding studies. Mitchell et al. (2008) introduce pairwise matching accuracy. Because of their small sample size, they use a leave-2-out cross-validation, which later work also adopted. The metric is a binary classification accuracy metric on a balanced dataset, so a random baseline converges toward 0.5. Many studies have relied on this metric, both in encoding and decoding (see Table 2). 4 Pearson correlationPearson correlation is another widely used metric in the studies surveyed above, measuring the linear relationship between variables, and providing insight into the strength and direction of their association. Huth et al. (2016), compute Pearson correlation between predicted and actual brain responses using Gaussian random vectors to test statistical significance. Resulting p-values are corrected for multiple comparisons within each subject using false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Others have used Bonferroni correction (Huth et al., 2016) or block-wise permutation test (Adolf et al., 2014) to evaluate the statistical significance of the correlation (Zhang et al., 2020). Some report R 2 (explained variance) instead of or in addition to correlation coefficients (Minnema and Herbelot, 2019;Reddy and Wehbe, 2021). Others have adopted a more elaborate extension of Pearson correlation, namely BrainScore (Schrimpf et al., 2018). Brain-Score is estimated on held-out test data, calculating Pearson's correlation between model predictions and neural recordings divided by the estimated ceiling and averaged across voxels and participants.

Percentile rank was first used for encoding (Mitchell et al., 2008), but can also be used for decoding (Pereira et al., 2018;Gauthier and Levy, 2019;Minnema and Herbelot, 2019). In encoding, the predicted brain image for w is ranked along the predicted images for a set of candidate words w ′ by their similarity to the real (ground truth) image for w. The average rank is then reported. For decoding, they rank word vectors rather than neural response images. Note the similarity metric is unspecified, but typically cosine distance is used.

Mean squared error, the average of the squared differences between word vectors and neural responses, was first used for encoding in Søgaard (2016) on a held-out test split. It was also used by Gauthier and Levy (2019).

Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was introduced in Kriegeskorte et al. (2008) as a non-parametric way to characterize structural alignment between the geometries of representations derived from disparate modalities. RSA abstracts away from activity patterns themselves and instead computes representational similarity matrices (RSMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation method through global similarity structure. A rank correlation coefficient is computed between RSMs derived from the two spaces, providing a summary statistic indicative of the overall representational alignment between them. Being non-parametric, RSA circumvents many of the various methodological weaknesses (such as over fitting, etc.). Gauthier and Levy (2019), Minnema and Herbelot (2019), and  apply (variations of) RSA to investigate the relations between different model components, and then to study the alignment of these components with brain response.

Cosine similarity was used in Mitchell et al. (2008) to select between the candidate images in pairwise matching accuracy, as well as in percentile rank and RSA, but the raw cosine similarities between predicted and real images or embeddings can also be used as a metric. Minnema and Herbelot (2019) use this metric to quantify how close the predicted word vectors are to the target. Finally, Zou et al. (2022) use precision@k, a standard metric in other mapping problems, e.g., cross-lingual word embeddings (Søgaard et al., 2019).

Comparisons Most metrics are used to evaluate both encoding and decoding models (pairwise matching accuracy, Pearson correlation, percentile rank, MSE, RSA, cosine distance). Results for two of the most widely used metrics -pairwise matching accuracy 5 and percentile rank -tend to be around 0.7-0.8 with generally better results for more recent architectures and larger LMs. To draw conclusions across studies relying on different metrics, we need to investigate which metrics are more conservative, and how different metrics relate.

Pairwise matching accuracy vs. Pearson correlation It seems that pairwise matching accuracy tends to increase monotonically with Pearson correlation. Consider three sets of distances over corresponding point sets, A, B, and C. If A and B are more strongly linearly correlated than A and C, under an optimal linear mapping Ω (minimizing point-wise squared error distance), E[(a − bΩ) 2 ] > E[(a − cΩ) 2 ]. Even in this conservative setting in our synthetic experiments in Appendix A.1, the correlation between matching accuracy and percentile rank was very high,~0.9.

Pairwise matching accuracy vs. percentile rank Both metrics have random baseline scores of 0.5, and they will converge in the limit. If a has a percentile rank of p in a list A, it will be higher than a random member of A p percent of the time. In our experiments in Appendix A.1, the correlation converges toward 1.0, with values consistently higher than 0.8 for N = 100.

Pairwise matching accuracy vs. precision@k are also positively correlated. Perfect score in one entails perfect score in the other, but precision@k can of course be very small for very high values of pairwise matching accuracy (especially if the set of candidate words is big). Conversely, we can have 5 When discriminating averages over 20 images (Wehbe et al., 2014b), scores are naturally lower. saturation for high values of k, because matching accuracies higher than n−k n will mean near-perfect precision@k scores. In practice, precision@k (for low values of k) will be much more conservative, however. The correlation coefficient for N = 100 (see Appendix A.1) tends to lie around 0.7.

Relative strength Pairwise Matching Accuracy is a relatively permissible performance metric. To see this, consider the scenario in which all target words can be divided into two equal-sized buckets based on word length (number of characters). Say the neural responses capture nothing but this binary distinction between long and short words, but do so perfectly. Moreover, our mapping method, e.g., linear regression, learns this from training data. Now, from this alone, the pairwise matching accuracy will converge toward µ = 0.75, since our model will do perfectly (1.0) on half of the data, and exhibit random performance (0.5) on the other half. If the neural responses tracked word length (and not just the distinction between short and long words), performance would be even better. In other words, Pairwise Matching Accuracy scores around 0.7-0.8 (observed in the studies above) may only reflect very shallow processing characteristics. The fact that Minnema and Herbelot (2019) only observed good results with this metric, led them to adopt a rather critical stance, for good reasons.

Other metrics are clearly more conservative. For a set of n candidate words, a random mapping will induce a precision@1-score of 1 n . While hubs may inflate scores for larger values, the metric is extremely conservative for small values of k. However, only Zou et al. (2022) use this metric, and they modify the experimental protocol substantially, making the task much easier by providing additional input to a non-linear model. The small improvement from adding neural response input is interesting, but could potentially be explained by shallow processing characteristics.

They argue that analogy testing would provide a better evaluation protocol: one would ideally use standard metrics such as semantic relatedness judgment tasks, analogy tasks, etc.

[but] this is not possible due to the limited vocabulary sizes of the available brain datasets Such evaluation is possible on small scale, though, and increasingly larger fMRI datasets are becoming available (see above). Zhang et al. (2020) have identified analogical reasoning in fMRI brain activation spaces. The analogies are computed using vector offset and probe the systematicity of how semantic relations are encoded. If a model encodes the capital-of relation systematically, we can retrieve the capital of Germany by subtracting the fMRI vector for 'Paris' from the sum of our the fMRI vectors for Germany and France. This is the same kind of analogical reasoning found in language models (Mikolov et al., 2013). Garneau et al. (2021) show that the more language models satisfy analogies, the more isomorphic they are.

So far, it seems that, with the possible exception of Zhang et al. (2020), there is little evidence for structural similarities, beyond what could be induced by shallow processing characteristics, but what about all the studies that report strong Pearson correlations? Per-voxel correlation coefficients are low on average, but across the above studies, typically only around 4-40% of the voxels exhibit significant correlations (Huth et al., 2016;. Since these correlations have been replicated across different datasets, they are generally not disputed, but could still reflect rather shallow processing characteristics.

On a more positive note, several studies show that larger (and better) language models align better with neural response measurements (Schrimpf et al., 2021;. This suggests that language models in the future may align even better with such measurements, possibly reflecting properties of deep processing. Such correlations with model quality and size are positive, making the results reported above more credible.

Generally, the conclusions we can draw from the above studies are somewhat vague. There are two reasons for this: (i) Past studies have relied on permissible (pairwise matching accuracy) and ambiguous (Pearson correlation) performance metrics; and (ii) past studies have relied on small-sized datasets. We believe that this calls for a meta-analysis of the above studies. To provide grounds for such a meta-analysis, we have in this section taken steps to compare the metrics used in these studies. We leave it for future work to explore various ways effect sizes can be computed across these studies.","[['b53', 'b69', 'b27', 'b38', 'b9', None, 'b57', 'b40', 'b2'], ['b20', 'b38', 'b40', 'b50'], ['b20'], ['b20', 'b31', 'b38'], ['b70', 'b38', 'b60', 'b40'], [], [], [], ['b68'], ['b38'], ['b70'], [], ['b35', 'b18', 'b69'], ['b27', 'b69'], ['b56'], []]","[['b53', 'b69', 'b27', 'b38', 'b9', None, 'b57', 'b40', 'b2'], ['b20', 'b38', 'b40', 'b50'], ['b20'], ['b20', 'b31', 'b38'], ['b70', 'b38', 'b60', 'b40'], [], [], [], ['b68'], ['b38'], ['b70'], [], ['b35', 'b18', 'b69'], ['b27', 'b69'], ['b56'], []]",30,"sent1: We present the evaluation metrics used in the above studies and discuss how they relate.
sent2: See Table 2 for a summary of metrics and corresponding studies.
sent3: Mitchell et al. (2008) introduce pairwise matching accuracy.
sent4: Because of their small sample size, they use a leave-2-out cross-validation, which later work also adopted.
sent5: The metric is a binary classification accuracy metric on a balanced dataset, so a random baseline converges toward 0.5.
sent6: Many studies have relied on this metric, both in encoding and decoding (see Table 2).
sent7: 4 Pearson correlationPearson correlation is another widely used metric in the studies surveyed above, measuring the linear relationship between variables, and providing insight into the strength and direction of their association.
sent8: Huth et al. (2016), compute Pearson correlation between predicted and actual brain responses using Gaussian random vectors to test statistical significance.
sent9: Resulting p-values are corrected for multiple comparisons within each subject using false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
sent10: Others have used Bonferroni correction (Huth et al., 2016) or block-wise permutation test (Adolf et al., 2014) to evaluate the statistical significance of the correlation (Zhang et al., 2020).
sent11: Some report R 2 (explained variance) instead of or in addition to correlation coefficients (Minnema and Herbelot, 2019;Reddy and Wehbe, 2021).
sent12: Others have adopted a more elaborate extension of Pearson correlation, namely BrainScore (Schrimpf et al., 2018).
sent13: Brain-Score is estimated on held-out test data, calculating Pearson's correlation between model predictions and neural recordings divided by the estimated ceiling and averaged across voxels and participants.
sent14: Percentile rank was first used for encoding (Mitchell et al., 2008), but can also be used for decoding (Pereira et al., 2018;Gauthier and Levy, 2019;Minnema and Herbelot, 2019).
sent15: In encoding, the predicted brain image for w is ranked along the predicted images for a set of candidate words w ′ by their similarity to the real (ground truth) image for w.
sent16: The average rank is then reported.
sent17: For decoding, they rank word vectors rather than neural response images.
sent18: Note the similarity metric is unspecified, but typically cosine distance is used.
sent19: Mean squared error, the average of the squared differences between word vectors and neural responses, was first used for encoding in Søgaard (2016) on a held-out test split.
sent20: It was also used by Gauthier and Levy (2019).
sent21: Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was introduced in Kriegeskorte et al. (2008) as a non-parametric way to characterize structural alignment between the geometries of representations derived from disparate modalities.
sent22: RSA abstracts away from activity patterns themselves and instead computes representational similarity matrices (RSMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation method through global similarity structure.
sent23: A rank correlation coefficient is computed between RSMs derived from the two spaces, providing a summary statistic indicative of the overall representational alignment between them.
sent24: Being non-parametric, RSA circumvents many of the various methodological weaknesses (such as over fitting, etc.).
sent25: Gauthier and Levy (2019), Minnema and Herbelot (2019), and  apply (variations of) RSA to investigate the relations between different model components, and then to study the alignment of these components with brain response.
sent26: Cosine similarity was used in Mitchell et al. (2008) to select between the candidate images in pairwise matching accuracy, as well as in percentile rank and RSA, but the raw cosine similarities between predicted and real images or embeddings can also be used as a metric.
sent27: Minnema and Herbelot (2019) use this metric to quantify how close the predicted word vectors are to the target.
sent28: Finally, Zou et al. (2022) use precision@k, a standard metric in other mapping problems, e.g., cross-lingual word embeddings (Søgaard et al., 2019).
sent29: Comparisons Most metrics are used to evaluate both encoding and decoding models (pairwise matching accuracy, Pearson correlation, percentile rank, MSE, RSA, cosine distance).
sent30: Results for two of the most widely used metrics -pairwise matching accuracy 5 and percentile rank -tend to be around 0.7-0.8 with generally better results for more recent architectures and larger LMs.
sent31: To draw conclusions across studies relying on different metrics, we need to investigate which metrics are more conservative, and how different metrics relate.
sent32: Pairwise matching accuracy vs. Pearson correlation It seems that pairwise matching accuracy tends to increase monotonically with Pearson correlation.
sent33: Consider three sets of distances over corresponding point sets, A, B, and C. If A and B are more strongly linearly correlated than A and C, under an optimal linear mapping Ω (minimizing point-wise squared error distance), E[(a − bΩ) 2 ] > E[(a − cΩ) 2 ].
sent34: Even in this conservative setting in our synthetic experiments in Appendix A.1, the correlation between matching accuracy and percentile rank was very high,~0.9.
sent35: Pairwise matching accuracy vs. percentile rank Both metrics have random baseline scores of 0.5, and they will converge in the limit.
sent36: If a has a percentile rank of p in a list A, it will be higher than a random member of A p percent of the time.
sent37: In our experiments in Appendix A.1, the correlation converges toward 1.0, with values consistently higher than 0.8 for N = 100.
sent38: Pairwise matching accuracy vs. precision@k are also positively correlated.
sent39: Perfect score in one entails perfect score in the other, but precision@k can of course be very small for very high values of pairwise matching accuracy (especially if the set of candidate words is big).
sent40: Conversely, we can have 5 When discriminating averages over 20 images (Wehbe et al., 2014b), scores are naturally lower.
sent41: saturation for high values of k, because matching accuracies higher than n−k n will mean near-perfect precision@k scores.

259108815,Mapping Brains with Language Models: A Survey,"Computer Science, Linguistics",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a92c82231c0ea7027ab20b25fe5f82565047aad7,s4,Discussion,"Many studies, summarized above, aim to compare language model representations with neural response measurements using linear mapping mod-els. Our main reason to focus on linear mapping models is that they quantify the degree of structural similarity (isomorphism). Overall, results suggest that structural similarities between language models and neural responses exist. Furthermore, there is good evidence that alignment has correlated positively with model quality and model size, suggesting a certain level of convergence as language models improve.

What drives alignment? Is alignment driven by deep processing characteristics or by shallow textual characteristics? Classical candidates for shallow ones would be word length, frequency, regularity, and part of speech. Mitchell et al. (2008), for example, only controlled for part of speech. Some authors have presented results to suggest that alignments are driven by syntactic or semantic factors (Abdou et al., 2021;Reddy and Wehbe, 2021;Caucheteux et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2020), whereas others have claimed some similarities reflect semantic phenomena (Huth et al., 2016;Caucheteux et al., 2021). Others suggest that alignments reflect deeper similarities between model objectives and predictive processing in human brains (Schrimpf et al., 2018;Caucheteux et al., 2022a;Goldstein et al., 2021), but see Antonello and Huth (2022) for a critical discussion of such work.

Linguistically-transparent models that allow for a principled decomposition of a model's components into smaller linguistically meaningful units and models that move towards possible neurobiological implementations of neural computation are likely to be key for answering this question Ten Oever et al., 2022). Given the plethora of interpretability methods recently developed, however, we believe that even models which are not intrinsically interpretable can be useful toward this goal.

Do some models align better? Most studies observe that better and larger, contextual models align better with neural responses (Jain and Huth, 2018;. Other improvements include fine-tuning on specific tasks (Oota et al., 2022b;Aw and Toneva, 2023). Pasquiou et al. (2022) outline the impact of model training choices.

What metrics? The inconsistent use of performance metrics makes it hard to compare and interpret the results reported in the literature (Beinborn et al., 2023). We have shown that some metrics are perhaps too permissible to detect structural sim-ilarities between language models and neural responses. We have argued that precision@k is more conservative than most other metrics. Minnema and Herbelot (2019) have proposed using analogy scores. In the limit (given sufficient analogies), perfect analogical accuracy implies isomorphism (Garneau et al., 2021). So do perfect precision@1 and perfect RSA scores. We, therefore, propose giving priority to these performance metrics, not to conflate shallow processing characteristics with deeper, more semantic properties.

Meta-analysis?

Diversification and mining methods aim to diversify and optimize prompts by mining Wikipedia or other resources, and selecting the best performing prompts or a combination of them.For example, Jiang et al. (2020b) propose a mining-based and a paraphrasing-based approach to create alternative prompts that outperform manual ones.The final prompts are selected based on their performance on a training set, and can also be combined in an ensemble.Bouraoui et al. (2020) mine for prompts that contain the entities of interest, and filter these based on the ability of the probed PLMs to predict the masked objects.After the filtering step, the remaining prompts are utilized to create a dataset that consists of positive inputs, i.e., containing true subject-object pairs, and negative inputs, which contain false pairs.This dataset is then used for the final evaluation.

Direct optimization methods aim to directly optimize existing prompts.This optimization happens either in a discrete space, to keep the prompts in natural language, or in a continuous space where the prompts do not have to correspond to specific tokens from the vocabulary.Optimization could also target only the masked token or the order of the examples in the prompt, in case a few examples are provided in the prompt to better indicate the task.Shin et al. (2020)'s AUTOPROMPT extends manually created prompts by prompts with a pre-defined number of trigger tokens, and employs gradientbased search to sequentially replace the trigger tokens with concrete tokens.These tokens are chosen to increase the probability of predicting the correct object.OPTIPROMPT (Zhong et al., 2021) is sim-ilar to AUTOPROMPT, but allows for the trigger tokens to be replaced with vectors from a continuous embedding space.In a similar fashion, Qin and Eisner (2021) propose learning an ensemble of continuous prompts per relation.Additionally, they perturb the representations of the prompts in each layer in the probed PLMs using small learnable vectors.The intuition is to have activation patterns that are similar to the ones encountered during pre-training, which would make it easier to elicit knowledge from PLMs.Newman et al. (2022) utilize adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) to map the embedding vectors to continuous prompts in order to make the probed PLMs less sensitive to different phrasings of the same prompts.Saeed and Papotti (2022) augment the masked tokens with a special type of embeddings, called Type Embeddings.These embeddings are derived from several entities that share the same type, and are shown to help tie the probed PLM's predictions to the expected type of the masked entity.PERO (Kumar and Talukdar, 2021) depends on querying PLMs with prompts containing few training examples (or shots), which demonstrate the task to the queried PLMs.Since PLMs are quite sensitive to the order and the quality of the provided training examples in the prompt, PERO leverages a genetic algorithm to find an optimized prompt and a separator token to concatenate the examples in the prompts.(Li et al., 2022c) exploit the symmetry of the task, and optimize prompts in a continuous space so that the probability of predicting both the subject and the object is maximized using the resulting prompts.

Large language models are known to perform generally better and hold more knowledge (Brown et al., 2020;Roberts et al., 2020).However, the model's architecture and pre-training objectives are more decisive for knowledge retention than its size (Li et al., 2022a).For example, pre-training with the Salient Span Masking objective (Guu et al., 2020) helps PLMs to absorb more facts (Roberts et al., 2020;Cole et al., 2023).Similarly, Xiong et al. (2020) demonstrate that training the model to predict if the original entities in the text have been replaced with other entities is beneficial for fact retrieval.More generally, Ye et al. (2021) conclude that a masking strategy matching the downstream task, positively affects the performance on that task.

A larger pre-training corpus with an encoderonly model (Liu et al., 2020) leads to higher knowledge retention (Zhang et al., 2021), but with an encoder-decoder model (Lewis et al., 2020), a larger corpus negatively affects knowledge retention Wang et al. (2021a).Recency (Chiang et al., 2020) and frequency (Kandpal et al., 2023), i.e., when and how often the data is observed at training, are also essential for knowledge retention.

Larger models and more pre-training data can improve knowledge retention if combined with the right choices for architecture and pre-training objective(s).However, scaling might not be sufficient (Kandpal et al., 2023).Even though many works propose new architectures and pre-training objectives to increase factual knowledge retention in PLMs and their robustness to prompts (Févry et al., 2020;Hosseini et al., 2021;Sadeq et al., 2022;Whitehouse et al., 2022;Min et al., 2023;Zhong et al., 2023), this is a promising future work direction, as there is more room for improvement.","[[], ['b59', 'b7', 'b109', 'b15', 'b89', 'b28', 'b107'], ['b49', 'b64', None, 'b103', 'b57', 'b12'], ['b73', 'b91', 'b49', 'b106', 'b24', 'b35', 'b116']]","[[], ['b59', 'b7', 'b109', 'b15', 'b89', 'b28', 'b107'], ['b49', 'b64', None, 'b103', 'b57', 'b12'], ['b73', 'b91', 'b49', 'b106', 'b24', 'b35', 'b116']]",20,"sent1: PLMs are diverse with respect to their architectures, pre-training objectives and their pre-training data.

Interpretability.Identifying where facts are stored and how they are retrieved is essential to adopt PLMs as trustworthy knowledge sources.Several approaches locate knowledge in PLMs (Wallat et al., 2020;Podkorytov et al., 2021;Alkhaldi et al., 2022;Dai et al., 2022;Meng et al., 2022a), with different conclusions depending on the architecture (e.g., knowledge is located in the middle layers of GPT-like models (Meng et al., 2022a), or in the upper layers in BERT-like models (Dai et al., 2022)).Another line of work focuses on the data aspect, showing the dependence of PLMs on word co-occurrences and positionally close words (Li et al., 2022b), or tracing back predictions to training data (Akyurek et al., 2022;Park et al., 2023).Knowing how PLMs retrieve facts remains challenging, but necessary to make PLMs transparent fact retrievers.The introduction of a fact tracing benchmark (Akyurek et al., 2022) opens the door for works in this direction.

Updating Knowledge.PLMs come with a fixed set of pre-trained parameters that encode knowledge about the world.As time passes, this knowledge becomes partially outdated.Hence, editing existing knowledge in PLMs and augmenting them with new knowledge is crucial for their use as knowledge bases (Zini and Awad, 2022).

One line of research locates the modules responsible for factual predictions and modifies these to update the corresponding facts (Dai et al., 2022;De Cao et al., 2021;Meng et al., 2022a).Other lines of research keep the original PLM unchanged, but augment it with additional parameters to induce the desired changes (Wang et al., 2021b;Lee et al., 2022), or encode facts with time stamps in PLMs to make them ""time-aware"" (Dhingra et al., 2022).

Typed querying.Kassner et al. (2021) propose to restrict the space of possible values for replacing the masked token (object) from the whole vocabulary to a specific set of tokens whose type matches the type of the ground truth object.For example, if the PLM is queried with the prompt: ""The smallest country in the world is [MASK]"", only entities of type country are considered to replace the [MASK] token.This method has two advantages: it reduces the number of objects under consideration and allows for a better comparison across PLMs with different vocabularies (Kassner et al., 2021).

Debiasing.Zhao et al.

Circuits are a model of parallel computation particularly relevant to transformers.For more details, please see the textbook by Arora and Barak (2009).Circuits operate on binary values.If we choose a fixed-length encoding of the symbols of Σ as strings of  = ⌈log 2 |Σ|⌉ bits, then a circuit can simulate input alphabet Σ by encoding the value of the -th input symbol into positions  to + (−1).For the rest of this section, we assume Σ = {0, 1}.

Circuits A circuit  with input length  is a directed acyclic graph with  input vertices  1 , . . .,   and zero or more gate vertices, each labeled by NOT, AND, or OR.Input vertices have fan-in (in-degree) zero, NOT gates have fan-in one, and the fan-in of AND and OR gates can be either two or unbounded.One (input or gate) vertex  is designated the output of the circuit.

Given an input string  ∈ {0, 1}  , each input vertex   is assigned the value   , and each gate vertex is assigned the value computed by applying its corresponding logical function to the values assigned to its in-neighbors.The circuit computes the boolean function  : {0, 1}  → {0, 1}, mapping each input string to the value assigned to .The depth of , denoted  (), is the length of the longest directed path from any   to .The size of , denoted | |, is the number of vertices in .Uniformity As defined, a circuit family contains a different circuit for each length , with no constraint on the relationship between the circuits.For example, let  be any unary language:  ⊆ {1} * .For  ∈ N, if 1  ∉ , define   to be a circuit for the constant 0 function (an OR gate with fan-in 0), and if 1  ∈ , define   to be a circuit for the AND of all the inputs.Thus, every unary language, even an undecidable one, is recognized by a circuit family of size  () and depth  (1).","[['b61', None, 'b50'], [], [], [], ['b3'], [], []]","[['b61', None, 'b50'], [], [], [], ['b3'], [], []]",4,"sent1: We assume familiarity with finite automata and Turing machines; for definitions, please see the textbook by Sipser (2013).Background on counter machines is given by Fischer et al.
