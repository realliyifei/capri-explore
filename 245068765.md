## Introduction

Cloeon Leach, 1815 [1] (or Cloeon/fg2 sensu Kluge, 2012 [2]) is a cosmopolitan mayfly genus [3,4]. Diverse species have been reported from Africa [5], Europe [6], North America [7], South America [8,9], India [10,11], Japan [12], Korea [13], Mongolia [14], Australia [15], and Pacific Islands [16]. However, the species in this genus have never been systematically studied in China.

Historically, nine Cloeon species names have been reported from China [4,17,18]. Among them, eight were described by Ulmer between 1910-1940. They describe subimagoes, females, or even undeclared sexes, but the types are lost or damaged [19,20] and the descriptions are usually extremely brief and often lack figures. Consequently, these

Besides pale midline of abdominal terga, each tergum with three pairs of pale dots ( Figure 1A): one pair near midline, one on anterolateral angles and one on posterolateral angles. Median pair round pale dots relatively regular but other two pairs irregular in size and shapes. Terga IV and VII paler than others. Lateral margins of posterior half tergum VIII and whole tergum IX with spines ( Figure 2F); posterior margins of terga with spines. Paraproct with spines on inner margin except 1/3 base ( Figure 2J).

Caudal filaments pale, every four segments with a brown ring ( Figure 1A,B and Figure 2E); basal 2/3 cerci with long hair-like setae on mesal margins but terminal filament with similar setae on both lateral margins; all articulations of caudal filaments with a ring of spines, those on outer margins of cerci longer and broader ( Figure 2E).

Diagnosis (based on specimens stored in alcohol): The male imagoes of this species can be identified by their transparent wings ( Figures 5A and 6A), almost chestnut to reddish terga ( Figures 5A and 7A), each tergum with a pale midline and a pair of triangular to round pale dots ( Figure 7A); pale portions are usually enlarged and emerged into a larger portion in each tergum, producing a wide longitudinal pale midline; lateral margins of terga also pigmented with short conspicuous reddish stripes ( Figure 7A,B); abdominal sterna washed with irregular light reddish pigments or stains at midlines, those of sterna VII-IX sometimes forming reddish dots ( Figure 7B); a round projection with a round tip between two forceps; segment 2 of forceps with slightly expanded base and apex; segment 3 tiny ( Figure 7C). The female imagoes can be differentiated by their almost reddish terga ( Figures 5B and 8A), each tergum with a pale midline and a pair of pale dots ( Figure 8A); lateral margins of terga also with reddish lines ( Figure 8A  Besides pale midline of abdominal terga, each tergum with three pairs of pale dots ( Figure 1A): one pair near midline, one on anterolateral angles and one on posterolateral angles. Median pair round pale dots relatively regular but other two pairs irregular in size and shapes. Terga IV and VII paler than others. Lateral margins of posterior half tergum    Remarks: Mature nymphs of this species are similar to C. harveyi ( Figure 1E,F) and C. viridulum ( Figure 1G,H) by having terga VIII and IX with lateral spines and caudal filaments without median dark bands ( Figure 1A,B) (in contrast, C. dipterum have lateral spines on terga VI-IX and dark markings on caudal filaments, Figure 1C,D). However, the nymphal stages of C. bicolor can be identified by pale abdominal sterna with median reddish dots on posterior margin only (those of C. viridulum are totally pale, abdominal sterna of C. harveyi have clear longitudinal stripes) (Figure 8A,E,G), the length of claws (longer than C. viridulum but shorter than C. harveyi) ( Figure 3M,O,P), and relatively regular pairs of pale dots on terga. The nymphs of this species are very similar to C. viridulum in color pattern and most structures (such as the claw, maxilla, lateral spines on terga VIII-IX), but they have relatively dark bodies (especially those terga II-III, V-VI) but lack independent dark dots on terga II and V ( Figure 1A,G).

The six indoor-reared nymphs were seen molting into subimagoes at 18:00-20:00 p.m. local time. Before 7:00 a.m. the next morning, they became imagoes. Remarks: Mature nymphs of this species are similar to C. harveyi ( Figure 1E,F) and C. viridulum ( Figure 1G,H) by having terga VIII and IX with lateral spines and caudal filaments without median dark bands ( Figure 1A,B) (in contrast, C. dipterum have lateral spines on terga VI-IX and dark markings on caudal filaments, Figure 1C,D). However, the nymphal stages of C. bicolor can be identified by pale abdominal sterna with median reddish dots on posterior margin only (those of C. viridulum are totally pale, abdominal sterna of C. harveyi have clear longitudinal stripes) (Figure 8A,E,G), the length of claws (longer than C. viridulum but shorter than C. harveyi) ( Figure 3M,O,P), and relatively regular pairs of pale dots on terga. The nymphs of this species are very similar to C. viridulum in color pattern and most structures (such as the claw, maxilla, lateral spines on terga VIII-IX), but they have relatively dark bodies (especially those terga II-III, V-VI) but lack independent dark dots on terga II and V ( Figure 1A,G).

The six indoor-reared nymphs were seen molting into subimagoes at 18:00-20:00 p.m. local time. Before 7:00 a.m. the next morning, they became imagoes.      


### Cloeon dipterum (Linnaeus, 1761)

Ephemera diptera Linnaeus, 1761: 377 [24] Sowa, 1975 [33].

Diagnosis (based on specimens stored in alcohol): The male imagoes of this species can be identified by their pairs of crescent to triangular reddish brown markings on abdominal terga ( Figure 7D); posterior half of terga I-III and midline of terga VI-IX are alsoreddish ( Figure 7D); lateral margins of terga are reddish ( Figure 7D); pairs of reddish near-rectangular markings present on abdominal sterna ( Figure 7E). Wings lacking any pigments except at the base of subcostal brace ( Figure 6C). A cone-like median projection presents between forceps or on penial bridge ( Figure 7F). The female imagoes can be differentiated by their similar marking patterns to males ( Figures 8C and 7D), the heavily pigmented C and Sc sections of wings with irregular pale blanks ( Figure 6D). The mature nymphs of this species can be recognized by their relatively short apical segments of maxillary palpi ( Figure 3F), spines at least present on lateral lines of terga VII-IX, base of claw slightly broadened and basal 1/2 of claw with two rows of denticles ( Figure 3N).

Remarks: Both Gattolliat et al. (2008) [3] and Bauernfeind and Soldán (2012) [6] stated clearly that the nymphs of European C. dipterum or complexes of this species have spines on terga V-IX and the basal 2/3 of tarsal claws. However, all our collections from China and several nymphs from Vladivostok (Russia) have spines on the lateral margins of terga VII-IX only, although some individuals have three spines on terga VI. In addition, the tarsal claws have denticles on the basal half ( Figure 3N). Nevertheless, considering that Russia, Korea, and Japan have this species [12,13,37], we treat these two differences as variations between populations.  [4]. Diagnosis (based on specimens stored in alcohol): The male imagoes of this species can be identified by their pale terga I-VII and abdominal sterna but terga VIII-IX reddish brown ( Figure 7J,K), wings transparent ( Figure 6G); round projection between forceps ( Figure 7L). The female imagoes of it can be differentiated by its orange to reddish dorsal terga, each tergum with a pair of short bent pale stripes dorsally, lateral margins of terga pigmented with reddish dots ( Figure 8G); pale abdominal sterna ( Figure 8H). Wings transparent but costal and subcostal sections yellowish and semi-hyaline ( Figure 6H). The mature nymphs of this species can be diagnosed by their three subequal segments of maxillary palpi ( Figure 3H), without an expanded apical segment of labial palpi ( Figure 3L), relatively short tarsal claw with denticles on basal 2/3 ( Figure 3P). Most nymphs have two conspicuous dark spots on terga II and V, respectively ( Figure 1G).

Remarks: This species can be found in most parts of the Chinese mainland, including some man-made habitats, such as ponds in school campuses, city gardens, or reservoirs.

Based on pictures of specimens studied by Navás in 1931 and 1933, the species C. apicutum is regarded as a junior synonym of C. viridulum. The types of both species were collected from the same region (Shanghai, Jiangsu to Zhejiang province, eastern China), in which we intensively collected specimens.

Although the types of C. micki Tong and Dudgeon have not been examined, the presence of two spots on abdominal terga II and V in all life stages (occasionally not obvious), the similar male genitalia, dorsal color pattern of males and females, and characteristics of the tarsal claws and mouthparts of the nymphs support the designation of C. micki as a junior synonym of C. viridulum.

Due to the wide distribution and frequent collection of C. viridulum, the species C. virens found by Ulmer (1925Ulmer ( , 1935Ulmer ( -1936 on the Chinese mainland is also recognized as this species here. We found no individuals similar to C. virens in this region.

The type of the species C. pielinum is lost and without sex declaration. Based on its equal distribution (type from Shanghai) and similar description to the C. viridulum, it is also synymonized here. 


## Discussion

The males of four Chinese Cloeon species can be divided into two groups based on their abdominal sterna with or without reddish longitudinal stripes. The species C. harveyi ( Figure 7H) and C. dipterum ( Figure 7E) fall into the former category, but C. viridulum ( Figure 7K) and C. bicolor ( Figure 7B) belong to the latter. Similarly, the females of those four species can be divided into two groups due to their similar color patterns to males. In addition, the females of C. harveyi ( Figure 8F) and C. dipterum ( Figure 8D) have reddish brown stigmas, pigmented C and Sc sections of wings with clear pale dots or markings, while those of C. viridulum ( Figure 6H) and C. bicolor ( Figure 6B) have uniformly pigmented and semi-hyaline C and Sc sections only.

Besides color patterns on abdominal sterna, the nymphs of C. harveyi ( Figure 3G,O) and C. dipterum ( Figure 3F,N) have longer claws and maxillary palpi than those of C. viridulum ( Figure 3H,P) and C. bicolor ( Figure 3E,M).

Morphologically, four Cloeon species of the Chinese mainland can be identified easily. However, in most cases, the color patterns of the body and wings are used, and a few solid structures can be found in their tiny bodies for differentiation. Hopefully, molecular evidence can provide more information in future work, especially on the C. dipterum complex or other similar species, such as C. viridulum and C. ryogokuensis Gose, 1980 [52,53].

The Cloeon nymphs are typical lentic mayflies, and the imaginal stages of mayflies are thought to have weak flight abilities. However, all four Cloeon species found in China are also reported in other Asian countries, such as India and Japan, and C. dipterum is a cosmopolitan species. Some Pacific Islands are also Cloeon habitats. The dispersal or migration routes and biogeography of these species are interesting topics for future research.

The female imagoes can be differentiated by their similar abdominal marking patterns to males, but the markings of abdominal sterna are more conspicuous (Figure 8E,F); wings have heavily pigmented subcostal brace and pterostigma (Figure 6F). The mature nymphs of this species can be diagnosed by their relatively slim maxillary palpi (Figure 3G) and slender claw (Figure 3O), three segments of maxillary palpi subequal in length (Figure 3G), slightly broadened apical segment of labial palpi (Figure 3K), spines present on lateral lines of terga VIII-IX only, base half of claw with denticles (Figure 3O). The color pattern of mature nymphs is also similar to adults (Figure 1E,F and Figure 8E,F).

Dan Zhou; 1 nymph, Jiudaohe Village, Zhicheng Town, Yidu City, Hubei Province (111.493714 • E, 30.215748 • NDiagnosis (based on specimens preserved in alcohol): The male imagoes of this species can be identified by their terga I, VII-IX reddish brown, terga II-III, V-VI with clear triangular dots (those of tergum V sometimes very small) (Figure 7G); posterior and lateral margins of terga also reddish brown (Figure 7G); at least abdominal sterna VII-IX with a pair of longitudinal reddish stripes (Figure 7G), those of VIII-IX maybe fused together (Figure 7H); wings totally transparent except the subcostal brace (Figure 6E); cone-shaped median projection on penial bridge (Figure 7I). The female imagoes can be differentiated by their similar abdominal marking patterns to males, but the markings of abdominal sterna are more conspicuous (Figure 8E,F); wings have heavily pigmented subcostal brace and pterostigma (Figure 6F). The mature nymphs of this species can be diagnosed by their relatively slim maxillary palpi (Figure 3G) and slender claw (Figure 3O), three segments of maxillary palpi subequal in length (Figure 3G), slightly broadened apical segment of labial palpi (Figure 3K), spines present on lateral lines of terga VIII-IX only, base half of claw with denticles (Figure 3O). The color pattern of mature nymphs is also similar to adults (Figure 1E,F and Figure 8E,F). Remarks: The nymphs of this species can be collected from or found sharing the same pool or pond together with C. viridulum and C. bicolor. Three of them were found collecting from same water at several places.
