## Limitedno conclusion

Any of the following reasons: -Too few studies available -Inconsistency of direction of effect -Poor quality of studies ---


## Strong evidence Substantial effect on risk unlikely

Evidence of the absence of an effect (a summary estimate close to 1.0) from any of the following: a) A meta-analysis of RCTs b) At least two well-designed independent RCTs c) A well-designed pooled analysis of follow-up studies d) At least two well-designed follow-up studies -Absence of a dose response relationship (in follow-up studies)


## No -Absence

Het: Substantial unexplained heterogeneity or some unexplained heterogeneity PB: Publication bias Mec: Strong and plausible mechanistic evidence is required, desirable but not required, not required, or absent Special upgrading factors: -Presence of a plausible biological gradient ('dose response') in the association. Such a gradient need not be linear or even in the same direction across the different levels of exposure, so long as this can be explained plausibly.

-A particularly large summary effect size (a relative risk of 2.0 or more, or 0.5 or less, depending on the unit of exposure), after appropriate control for confounders.

-Evidence from appropriately controlled experiments demonstrating one or more plausible and specific mechanisms.

-All plausible known residual confounders or biases including reverse causation would reduce a demonstrated effect, or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect. Special considerations important for evidence for breast cancer survivors including the following potential confounding variablesthe type of tumour, type of treatment, amount of treatment received, and the dissemination of the disease. Hours per week of six recreational activities over the previous year: walking outdoors; running (≥10 min/mile); lap swimming; tennis, squash, or racquetball; calisthenics, aerobics, or rowing machine; and other aerobic recreation (e.g., lawn mowing). Usual walking pace (easy or <2 mph, average or 2-2.9 mph, brisk or 3-3.9 mph, and very brisk or ≥4 mph) and number of flights of stairs climbed daily. Exercise exposure was assessed using items from the Arizona Activity Frequency Questionnaire. Patients reported the frequency and duration of leisure-time recreational activities (e.g., walking, jogging, running, bicycling, swimming laps, racket sports) performed at least once a month in the past 6 (Pathways) or 12 months (LACE). Non-recreational activity (e.g., occupational activity, activities of daily living) was not included.

## SBCSS, China Chen, 2011

Regular exercise frequency and duration for up to five types of the most common exercises (methods described in Chen 2011). Each activity was assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) score. Walking was the most common type of regular exercise carried out in this study population (52%), followed by gymnastics (14%), body building (7%), and traditional Chinese exercises (5%, including Qigong and Tai Chi).

Recreational TEAM-L side study, DELCaP questionnaire was adapted from the Lifetime Physical Activity Questionnaire, a self-administered survey with established reliability among adult women and assessed mode, frequency, and duration of recreational physical activity. Total MET minutes/hours were calculated for each person at each time based on corresponding codes and MET values published in the Physical Activity Compendium. Activities were included in the analysis if performed at least once a week throughout the exposure window assessed and if the compendium MET value was at least 3.0 or higher.

## MARIE study, Germany

Jung 2019 Physical activity assessment included self-reported participation in walking and cycling for the purposes of commuting/transportation as well as recreational activities, sports, and fitness. MET-h/week were calculated by multiplying the average hours per week spent on each activity with an individual intensity score. Leisure-time physical activity defined as additional activities related to recreational physical activities, sports, and fitness. We have evaluated leisure-time physical activity and not total physical activity in relation to prognosis in this analysis.

## APPENDIX 2


## Details for physical activity estimations for dose-response analyses

The median or mean physical activity level in each category was assigned to the corresponding HR for each study. If studies reported the range of physical activity levels, we used the midpoint for each category. If the highest or lowest category was open-ended, we assumed its width to be the same as the adjacent category. If studies reported only categorical results, number of events and denominator data (person-years of follow-up or total number of persons) were required for inclusion in the meta-analysis for at least three categories of physical activity. When only the total number of events or person years was reported, and physical activity was categorised in quantiles, the distribution of persons or person years was calculated by dividing the total number of persons or person years by the number of quantiles.


## APPENDIX 3

Physical activity changes from before to after diagnosis and breast cancer prognosis Physical activity change from before diagnosis to after diagnosis and all-cause mortality

Seven studies 1-7 examining changes in physical activity before and after breast cancer diagnosis in relation to all-cause mortality were identified. In general, there is a tendency for better survival in women who increase post-diagnosis physical activity and worse survival in women with reduced post-diagnosis physical activity although the studies are limited by small sample sizes.

In the HEAL study, 5 null associations were observed for women who increased physical activity in the second year after diagnosis by 3 MET-h/week or more (HR=0.55, 95%CI 0.22-1.38; deaths=7), as well as for those who maintained physical activity levels within 3 MET-h/week (HR=1.55, 95%CI 0.64-3.80; deaths=11). Women who decreased physical activity after diagnosis by more than 3 MET-h/week had higher risk of death (HR=3.95, 95%CI 1.45-10.50, deaths=19) compared with women who were inactive both before and after diagnosis (0 MET-h/week). The results were similar after excluding 24 women who had an adverse event (recurrence, new primary, or death) within the two years after completing the post diagnosis physical activity questionnaire.

In the WHI study, 4 physical activity was assessed before diagnosis and at the third and sixth year of follow-up. Post-diagnosis physical activity was the closest assessment after diagnosis during follow-up. Women who increased or maintained physical activity of nine or more MET-h/week after diagnosis had lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0.67, 95%CI, 0.46-0.96, deaths=69) than women who were inactive before and after diagnosis (none or <9 MET-h/week before and close after diagnosis; deaths=46). No change in risk of all-cause mortality was observed in women who decreased physical activity (HR decrease compared to no change 1.06, 95%CI 0.73-1.54, deaths=53).

In the WHEL study, 1 four categories for change in physical activity were defined according to following a guideline of 10 MET-h/week before and one year after diagnosis. The association of women who never met the guideline compared to those who were meeting physical activity guidelines both at baseline and at one-year follow-up was null (HR=0.89, 95%CI 0.49-1.64). No reduction in risk of all-cause mortality was observed in women who were meeting physical activity guidelines at only a single time point (either before or after cancer diagnosis).

In the DCH study, 2 the influence of post-diagnosis physical activity on all-cause mortality was not modified by pre-diagnosis physical activity. In NOWAC, 3 women who reduced physical activity levels had higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR=1.76, 95%CI 1.21-2.56) than those women who maintained their constant activity level.

In the MARIE study, 6 women who were increasingly active compared to those who were insufficiently active had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0.50, 95% CI 0.31-0.82). A similar pattern to all-cause mortality was observed for breast cancer-specific mortality and recurrence but the 95%CI crossed the null value. In the publication by Akdeniz et al 2021 7 no associations were observed for all-cause mortality and physical activity changes, the 95%CI crossed the null value in multivariate analyses.


## Physical activity change from before diagnosis to after diagnosis and breast cancerspecific mortality

Four studies examining changes in physical activity before and after breast cancer diagnosis in relation to breast cancer mortality were identified. In HEAL 5 , no change in risk of breast cancerspecific mortality was observed in women who increased physical activity in the second year after diagnosis in 3 MET-h/week, compared to women who were inactive both before and after diagnosis (0 MET-h/week) (HR=0.82, 95%CI 0.29-2.34; deaths=6). The association was also null for women who either maintained (within 3 MET-h/week) or decreased their physical activity levels (by more than 3 MET-h/week) after diagnosis (HR=2.47, 95%CI 0.78-7.78; deaths=7 and HR=3.69, 95%CI 0.88-15.92, deaths=7, respectively).

In the WHI study 4 , compared to women with no physical activity change after diagnosis, no significant changes in breast cancer risks were observed in women who increased or maintained physical activity of 9 or more MET-h/week (HR=0.91, 95% CI, 0.51-1.64, deaths=32) or decreased physical activity from >9 to<9 MET-h/week or to no activity (HR=1.06, 95%CI 0.59-1.88, deaths=22). In NOWAC 3 , women who reduced physical activity levels had higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR=2.05, 95%CI 1.35-3.10) than women who maintained their constant activity level.

In the MARIE study 6 a similar pattern to all-cause mortality was observed for increasing levels of physical activity and breast cancer-specific mortality but the 95%CI crossed the null value.


## Physical activity change from before diagnosis to after diagnosis and breast cancer recurrence

Three studies (WHEL, MARIE study, publication by Akdeniz 2021) examining changes in physical activity before and after breast cancer diagnosis in relation to additional breast cancer events was identified. In this study, 1 women who never met the guideline of 10 MET-h/week either before or after diagnosis, did not have a lower risk of additional breast cancer events compared to women who met physical activity guidelines both before and at one year after diagnosis (HR=0.93, 95%CI 0.70-1.24, events=103 events). Higher risk of additional breast cancer events was observed in women who were meeting physical activity guidelines only after diagnosis (HR=1.44, 95%CI 1.02-2.03, events=49) but the association was null for those who met physical activity guidelines only before cancer diagnosis (HR=1.22, 95%CI 0.81-1.83, events=31).

In the MARIE study 6 a similar pattern to all-cause mortality was observed for increasing levels of physical activity and breast cancer-specific mortality but the 95%CI crossed the null value. In the publication by Akdeniz et al 2021 7 patients who started exercising after breast cancer diagnosis had lower risk of disease-free survival compared to those who did not do any exercise (HR=0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.44, p=0.001).

Time per week in the summer and winter on the following recreational activities: walking, cycling, gardening, and sports Recreational WISC, USA Veal 2017 Patterned on the Nurses' Health Study questionnaire. Regular physical activity (at least 30 min per week for at least 3 months of the year) including swimming, jogging/running, bicycling, calisthenics/aerobics/dance, racquet sports, walking/ hiking for exercise, and other individual and team activities as an open-ended response option. Participants reported the number of months per year and hours per week spent performing each activity. -item physical activity questionnaire adapted from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The physical activity questionnaire assessed frequency, duration, and speed of walking outside the home and frequency and duration of participation in each of three intensity levels of exercise: mild, moderate, or strenuous (with example activities for each level). Moderate intensity: defined as 3-<6 METs-h (this included walking, sports, exercise, and dance) and ≥6 METs-h intensity for vigorous activity. Examples of moderate to vigorous activities were 150 min/week of moderate pace walking or the equivalent amount of other exercise durations/intensities Recreational WHI, USA Irwin 2011 Frequency and duration of vigorous exercise (that increased heart rate and produced sweating) including aerobics, jogging, tennis, and swimming laps and of moderate intensity physical activities (including biking outdoors, exercise machine, calisthenics, easy swimming, and popular or folk dancing). Walking could be included in both categories depending on the pace Frequency and duration of moderate-and vigorous-intensity aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Meeting the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and American Cancer Society (ACS) exercise recommendations.Range of physical activities ''moderate activities'' (eg, yoga, mopping floors, sweeping, walking on a firm level surface 3-4 mph), ''hard activities'' (eg, aerobic dance, badminton, fast walking, scrubbing floors), or ''very hard activities'' (eg, circuit training, racquetball, rope jumping, cross-country running).Distance run or walked was obtained from the question "Average miles run per week for:" and then listed the current and preceding 5 years with spaces for the responses. To calculate MET-hours/day for walking, we converted walking distance into duration (i.e., distance/mph) and calculated the average hours walked per day and the MET value for the reported pace. Running MET values were calculated as 1.02 METhours per kmVarious

## Table 8
8Summary of the judgement of the WCRF Expert PanelDIET, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SURVIVAL IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCERThere is a dose-response relationship for all-cause mortality and breast-specific mortality, but the evidence may be limited in methodological quality. The strong risk reductions observed for the highest versus lowest physical activity levels are not plausible in context. Reverse causation and residual confounding cannot be ruled out, although the studies consistently reported a beneficial effect.Summary HR (95% CI) Highest vs. Lowest meta-analyses2020
