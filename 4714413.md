Candidemia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in an immunocompetent patient: A case report and literature review

into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, the patient was intubated and placed on a mechanical ventilator and administered continuous renal replacement therapy until HD 14 (postoperative day, POD 7). On HD 18 (POD 11), the patient complained of decreased visual acuity. On ophthalmologic examination, chorioretinal infiltrative spots of inflammatory cells due to hematogenous spread of Candida were noted [ Figure 2a]. The second blood culture performed after ERCP on HD 2 revealed growth of C. albicans sensitive to fluconazole; therefore, a 28-day course of IV fluconazole was prescribed. Bile culture was negative for bacterial and fungal growth. After 2 weeks of IV fluconazole and intravitreal voriconazole therapy, the chorioretinal infiltrative spots were improved on ophthalmologic examination, and the visual acuity also improved [ Figure 2b]. Resolution of the candidemia was confirmed by no growth of C. albicans on follow-up blood culture. On HD 44 (POD 37), the patient was discharged without additional sequelae.


## DISCUSSION

Post-ERCP candidemia is a rare procedure-related complication. [4] There is little information regarding development of candidemia following ERCP, especially in immunocompetent and noncritically ill patients. To date, three cases of post-ERCP candidemia have been reported [ Table 1]. [1][2][3] One case was candidemia caused by C. tropicalis in an immunocompetent patient without risk factors, and the others were candidemia caused by C. glabrata and C. tropicalis in patients with risk factors for disseminated candidemia. Typically, disseminated candidemia develops in immunocompromised or critically ill patients. [5] However, the patient in our case did not have any well-recognized risk factors or predisposing conditions for the development of disseminated candidemia including diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus infection with low cluster of 7.6 mg/dL; creatinine 0.8 mg/dL; total bilirubin 2.27 mg/dL; direct bilirubin 1.96 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase 160 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase 287 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase 238 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase 919 IU/L; C-reactive protein 1.6 mg/dL. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed diffuse gallbladder wall thickening and distension as well as a small filling defect in the common bile duct (CBD) [ Figure 1a]. After a blood culture sample was obtained, empirical intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone was administered on hospital day (HD) 1. On HD 2, therapeutic ERCP was performed. Written informed consent for ERCP was obtained from the patient. After endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), a CBD stone was removed by retrieval balloon and basket, and a 7Fr endoscopic nasobiliary catheter was inserted into the CBD [ Figure 1b]. The ERCP procedure was performed without difficulty, and no adverse event occurred during ERCP manipulation. Following ERCP, the patient developed a fever with a return of RUQ pain, and his antibiotics were changed to IV piperacillin/tazobactam; then, a second blood culture sample was obtained on HD 2. There was no growth on the first blood culture performed on HD 1. On HD 5, his condition worsened, with the development of severe chills, high fever, and RUQ pain. Repeat bloodwork revealed an elevated WBC count of 15460 mm/ 3 with 82.4% neutrophils and a creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL. On the second blood culture performed after ERCP on HD 2, colonies of yeast were noted, and IV fluconazole (400 mg) was administered. To evaluate GB function, cholescintigraphy was performed, and an absence of GB filling was noted; therefore, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed on HD 7. After cholecystectomy, the patient clinically deteriorated into candidal septicemia, and subsequently, differentiation (CD) 4+ T cell counts, the prolonged use of antibiotics, neutropenia, indwelling intravenous or urinary catheters, total parenteral nutrition administration, parenteral glucocorticoid administration, severe burns, abdominal or thoracic surgery, cytotoxic chemotherapy administration, the use of immunosuppressive agents for organ transplantation, mechanical ventilator usage, or low birth weight neonates. [6] There were several potential sources of Candida spread to the bloodstream in the present case. First, localized candidal infection of the GB or CBD may have been disseminated hematogenously following ERCP manipulation. Second, candidal contamination of the ERCP equipment and nasobiliary catheter or endoscope could have spread to the bloodstream through the EST site.

Third, systemic infection caused by C. albicans caused by ascending retrograde spread of a localized biliary infection secondary to colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (including the oropharynx and mouth) after ERCP could have developed. Fourth, hematogenous spread of Candida from the skin through the IV line could have occurred incidentally around the time of ERCP.

In conclusion, we report the first case of disseminated C. albicans infection following ERCP manipulation with secondary complications of ARDS, AKI, and endophthalmitis in an immunocompetent host. The present case highlights the awareness to consider candidemia as a rare but possibly life-threatening adverse event of ERCP, even in immunocompetent patients without apparent risk factors.
