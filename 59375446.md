This paper suggests a two-parameter ratio-product-ratio type exponential estimator for a finite population mean in simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) following the methodology in the studies ofSingh and Espejo (2003)andChami et al (2012).The bias and mean squared error of the suggested estimator are obtained to the first degree of approximation.The conditions are obtained in which suggested estimator is more efficient than the sample mean, classical ratio and product estimators, ratiotype and product type exponential estimators.An empirical study is given in support of the present study.

## Introduction

In sample surveys it is well established fact that the improvement in the precision of an estimator of the population mean Y of the study variable y is possible by using information on an auxiliary variable x (highly correlated with the study variable y ) at the estimation stage.It is known that if the correlation between study variate y and the auxiliary variate x is positive (high) the usual ratio estimator is employed.On the other hand if this correction is negative (high), the product method of estimation can be employed.Consider the finite population (1)

The classical ratio and product estimators for population mean Y are respectively given by
        = x X y y R (1.2)
and
      = X
x y y P (1.3)It can be shown that the ratio estimator R y is more efficient than the unbiased estimator y if (1.7)

The ratio-type exponential estimator Re y is better than unbiased estimator y if obtained in which the proposed class of ratio-product-ratio-type exponential estimators is preferred.We carry out an empirical study showing that the proposed class of ratioproduct-ratio-type exponential estimators out performs the estimators y ,


## The Suggested Two Parameter Ratio-Product-Ratio Type Exponential Estimator

For estimating the population mean Y of the main variable y , we suggest the following two-parameter ratio-product-ratio type exponential estimator:

where  , are real constants.The aim of this paper is to derive values for these constants  , such that the bias and / or the mean squared error (MSE) of ( )  , e T is minimal.

We mention that ( )

is invariant under point reflection through the point ( )

, the estimator reduces to the sample mean y , that is, we have


## Bias and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the Proposed Estimator

Applying the standard techniques we evaluate the first degree of approximation (upto terms of order 1 − n ) to the bias and mean squared error (MSE) of the suggested estimator ( )

is the sampling fraction.Further, it is assumed that the sample is so large as to make 0 e and 1 e small, justifying the first degree approximation considerd wherein we ignore the terms involving 0 e and/or 1 e in a degree greater than two, see Sahai and  Ray(1980, p.272).

The suggested ratio-product -ratio-type exponential estimator ( )

## Unbiased Asymptotically Optimum Estimator (AOE)

From (2.6) and (2.11), we can calculate the parameters  and  where our proposed estimator becomes at least up to first approximation-an unbiased AOE.We obtain a line with 2 1 =


## 

(recall that on this line our estimator always reduces to the sample mean estimator y )

We mention that the parametric "curve" in (4.2) is only defined for 0

fact, this parametric "curve" is three hyperbolas.

Inserting the values of ( )
C  and
( )
C   from (4.

It can be easily shown to the first degree of approximation that .Reddy (1978) has shown that the value of 'C' is more stable than other population parameters such as, the linear regression coefficient, over a period of time and least affected by the sampling fluctuations.So its value can be quite accurately guessed from the past data or a pilot survey or experienced gathered in due course of time.However, if the value of 'C' is not known, one may estimate it on the basis of sample observations without much loss of efficiency, for instance, see Singh et al (1994, p. 216).
