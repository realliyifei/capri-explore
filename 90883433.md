We review the three species currently placed in the genus

## Introduction

The tribe Xyloperthini Lesne, 1921 is the most species-rich in the Bostrichidae Latreille, 1802, and currently includes 34 genera (Borowski & Węgrzynowicz 2007;Park et al. 2015;Liu et al. 2016a).The tribe has a worldwide distribution, but the individual genera are mostly confi ned to a single zoogeographical region or subregion (Borowski & Węgrzynowicz 2007).

The genus Xylopertha Guérin-Méneville, 1845 was erected in a key to bostrichid genera, for several species previously included in the genus Apate Fabricius, 1775.In a footnote, Guérin-Méneville (1845) listed the 'types' of the genus as "Apate minuta Fabricius, truncata Dejean, longicornis Fabricius, sinuata Fabricius, etc.".Apate sinuata Fabricius, 1792 was selected as type species of the genus by Gorham (1883).Of the remaining species, truncata is a nomen nudum, minuta is now placed in Dinoderus Stephens, 1830, and longicornis in Tetrapriocera Horn, 1878 (Fisher 1950).Lesne (1901) erected a new genus, Xylonites Lesne, 1901, for two species, X. retusus (Olivier, 1790), originally described in the genus Bostrichus Geoffroy, 1762 (Olivier 1790), and X. praeustus (Germar, 1817), originally described in the genus Apate Fabricius, 1775(Germar 1817).However, Schilsky (1899) synonymised Apate sinuata, the type species of Xylopertha, with Xylonites retusus.Fisher (1950) synonymised Xylonites Lesne, 1901 with Xylopertha Guérin-Méneville, 1854.The species included by Lesne (1901) in the genus Xylopertha sensu Lesne 1901, were transferred to a new genus, Xyloperthella Fisher, 1950(Fisher 1950).Two more species have been added to Xylopertha since the publication of the monograph of Lesne (1901), X. refl exicauda (Lesne, 1937), and X. dunensis (Rai & Chatterjee, 1964).Xylopertha dunensis has been synonymised with X. praeusta (Germar, 1817) by Borowski & Singh (2017).Thus, Xylopertha currently includes three species (Borowski & Węgrzynowicz 2007;Borowski & Singh 2017).

In this paper we review the three species currently included in Xylopertha, and describe one further species, X. elegans sp.nov.We synonymise Paraxylogenes Damoiseau, 1968 with Xylopertha, and Paraxylogenes pistaciae Damoiseau, 1968 with X. refl exicauda.We also provide a key to the four species now included in Xylopertha.


## Material and methods

In the course of this study, the senior author has examined all available types, and other specimens of Xyloperthini in the Paris Museum, other European museums, and certain private collections.We have examined type materials or reliably identifi ed specimens of 31 out of 34 genera included in the tribe, and have checked the descriptions of the remaining three genera.

The following abbreviations are used for Museums and other collections: The descriptions of the species are mainly based on Lesne (1901Lesne ( , 1937)), with additional characters obtained from the examination of specimens from the museums and collections listed above, and dissection of specimens in LYL.

## Diagnosis

Xylopertha is the type genus of Xyloperthini Lesne (1921).The tribe is characterised by the lamelliform intercoxal process of the fi rst abdominal ventrite, and the mandibles crossed at the tips (Lesne 1921;Fisher 1950;Liu & Schönitzer 2011).The genus is distinguished from all other genera of Xyloperthini by the following combination of characters: frons with upwardly directed hairs (Fig. 2); antenna with nine antennomeres, the funicle with four and the club with three antennomeres, antennomeres of club lacking stiff, erect hairs, with indistinct sensory impressions near the apex of antennomeres 7 and 8, but absent on the last antennomere; pronotum without a lateral carina; elytral suture raised on declivity, but not strongly swollen; last ventrite of male with pleural pieces at sides; last ventrite of female emarginate.

European Journal of Taxonomy 380: 1-22 (2017) strongly impressed in middle; clypeus transverse, fi nely and densely punctured; labrum transverse with a fringe of long hairs along anterior margin.Mandibles subequal, sharply pointed.Eyes small, oval, strongly projecting.Antenna with 9 antennomeres, fi rst antennomere elongate, about twice as long as oval second, antennomeres 3-6 forming a loose funicle, each antennomere transverse, the fi fth widest, together about as long as fi rst antennomere of club, antennomeres 7-9 forming the elongate, compressed club, each antennomere of club with a dense covering of short, recumbent hairs, lacking distinct, clearly defi ned sensory impressions on all segments, antennomeres 7 and 8 subquadrate, subequal in length, last antennomere more elongate, oval.

PRONOTUM.Slightly wider than long, anterior angles with a small upcurved tooth without an uncus inserted a little behind margin, anterior margin between teeth slightly concave, not depressed behind the margin; area above anterior margin fl at or weakly impressed, strongly, densely punctured, without teeth;

ABDOMEN.Intercoxal process of fi rst abdominal ventrite lamelliform, the ventral face a little widened in one species (X.praeusta (Germar, 1817)).


## Sexual dimorphism

The genus shows strong sexual dimorphism in both the vestiture of the frons, and in the form and sculpture of the elytral declivity (except in X. refl exicauda), as well as in the genitalia.In the female the frons is more densely and fi nely punctured, and the upwardly directed hairs are much longer and denser than in the male.In the male, the elytral declivity is more angularly separated from the disc, and the elytral apices are either conjointly rounded or separated by a small V-shaped emargination.In the female, the disc curves more evenly into the declivity, and the elytral apices are strongly emarginate, the emargination partly fi lled by a pair of ventrally-directed processes (Fig. 3A-C) (except in X. refl exicauda; Fig. 3D).The last abdominal ventrite of the male has pleural pieces which converge posteriorly towards the midline; these are absent, and the last ventrite is emarginate in the female.


## Distribution

Southern and central Europe, North Africa and Middle East.


## Biology

The adults of Xylopertha are polyphagous, usually attacking a taxonomically wide variety of host trees, although they may appear to show some host preferences.They bore into twigs and branches, where they construct a short gallery, usually consisting of a circumferential and one or more longitudinal branches in which the eggs are laid (Liu et al. 2008).The larvae bore through the wood making extensive galleries fi lled with fi ne wood particles and excreta.The new generation of adults emerges through the bark, but may reattack the same stem, so that the whole of the sapwood is eventually converted into fi ne powder  (Olivier, 1790).B.

LIU L.-Y. & BEAVER R.A., A review of Xylopertha, with a new species (Liu et al. 2008).The development time is variable depending on local conditions, and may vary from a few weeks to over a year (Beeson & Bhatia 1937).

Xylopertha elegans sp.nov.urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:E4831142-6943-4892-8A65-B8AC0C2659D8Figs 1A-B, 2C, 3C, 4B, 5E-F Amongst the bostrichid collection in the Staatliche Naturhistorische Sammlungen, Dresden (now Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen, Dresden), the senior author found a series of specimens identifi ed as a new species of Xylopertha by J.M. Vrydagh, but not described.Further specimens were found in the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin.This species is described here using the specifi c name suggested by Vrydagh.


## Etymology

The specifi c epithet 'elegans' used by Vrydagh, is from the Latin word for 'elegant' or 'handsome'.


## Material examined

Vrydagh selected a holotype, allotype and four paratypes from SNSD, and one paratype from ZMHB.However, the holotype and allotype he selected are in poor condition, and we have accordingly selected a new holotype and allotype in better condition from the same series.

Holotype TURKEY: ♂, [Anatolia, Toros, Karaman, Habiller], (no date), [Muche leg.] (ZMHB).


## Allotype

TURKEY: ♂, same data as for holotype (SNSD).


## Paratypes

TURKEY: 6 ♂♂, 6 ♀♀, same data as for holotype (4 ♂♂, 3 ♀♀ in SNSD; 1 ♂, 2 ♀♀ in ZMHB; 1 ♂, 1 ♀ in LYL).

## Distribution

Central Turkey (Anatolia).(Lesne, 1937) Figs 1G-H, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5G-H Xylonites refl exicauda Lesne, 1937: 199 being the only species.Damoiseau (1968) separated the genus from four other genera of Xyloperthini with species having nine antennomeres, but failed to compare it with Xylopertha.


## Xylopertha refl exicauda

We have examined male and female syntypes of Xylopertha refl exicauda from Pakistan (MNHN), the holotype male, allotype female, and three female paratypes of Paraxylogenes pistaciae from Iraq and Pakistan (NHMUK, IRSNB), and further specimens from South Europe and Middle Asia in LYL, NMPC and IRSNB.It is clear that only a single species is represented, and P. pistaciae is here synonymised with X. refl exicauda.Buse et al. (2013) listed P. pistaciae as a synonym of Paraxylogenes refl exicauda [sic] in a paper on the ecology of oak wood-inhabiting beetles in Israel, but made no further comments, and gave no indication that they had examined type material.The synonymy of the only species of Paraxylogenes with X. refl exicauda automatically makes Paraxylogenes a synonym of Xylopertha.

We note below that the male and female genitalia of X. refl exicauda differ in several respects from those of the other species of Xylopertha.However, we do not consider these and other morphological differences suffi cient to retain Paraxylogenes as a distinct genus from Xylopertha.


## Diagnosis

Distinguished from Xylopertha elegans sp.nov.and X. retusa (Olivier, 1790) by the presence of a spine on each elytron in both sexes, the spines smaller in the female.Xylopertha refl exicauda differs from X. praeusta in the position of the spines, which are located on the middle of the upper margin of the declivity in X. refl exicauda, whereas in X. praeusta they are located on the dorso-lateral margin of the declivity (Fig. 1E-H).Xylopertha refl exicauda is also distinguished from the other three species of Xylopertha by the absence of any sexual modifi cation of the apical margin of the elytra.The male and female genitalia differ in certain respects from those of the other three species.The posterior margin of the 8th tergite of the male is sclerotised in X. refl exicauda (Fig. 5G), but membraneous in the other three species (Fig. 5A, C, E).The posterior margin of the last ventrite of the male is bidentate without a median lobe in X. refl exicauda (Fig. 5H), but has a median lobe and a process on either side in X. elegans sp.nov.(Fig. 5F) and X. retusa (Fig. 5B).In X. praeusta (Fig. 5D), the posterior margin is bilobed and lateral processes are present.The aedeagus of X. refl exicauda has a pair of long apophyses (Fig. 5H), but the apophyses are absent in the other three species (Fig. 5B, D, F).The last ventrite of the female of X. refl exicauda has a strong median ridge (Fig. 4D), which is absent in the other three species (Fig. 4A-C).


## Material examined

For Xylopertha refl exicauda (Lesne, 1934):  The specifi c identity of more than 70 further specimens was checked in the following museums: IRSNB and MAIC under X. refl exicauda; NHMUK and NMPC under Paraxylogenes pistaciae, but detailed locality data were not recorded.All specimens came from the distributional area given below.

HEAD.Above fi nely punctured, with erect, grey or reddish setae (denser and longer in female), eyes moderate, similar in both sexes; antennae 9-segmented, segments 3-6 very small, 7-9 forming the club, biconvex, subglabrous, sensory impressions scarcely visible, penultimate segment slightly transverse.PRONOTUM.Subquadrate, about 1.1 times wider than long, the sides weakly curved, widest at middle, with long hairs antero-laterally, anterior angles armed with small, sharp-edged and pointed teeth, the apex not uncinate; posterior part of disc very fi nely, sparsely punctured.

ELYTRA.Cylindrical part glabrous, fairly strongly punctured (in male sometimes weaker); apical declivity minutely punctured, with dense, recumbent, very short hairs; elytral declivity with a infl ated, sharply pointed spine located on the middle of upper margin of the declivity of each elytron (Figs 1G-H, 3D); elytral suture cariniform on declivity; apical margin entire, sutural angles prominent, refl exed, forming a v-shaped emargination, blunt at apex; postepipleura absent.


## Male

ABDOMEN.Last ventrite whole, pleural parts very distinct.The posterior margin of the 8 th tergite of the male is sclerotized, margin of the last ventrite of the male is bidentate without a median lobe (Fig. 5H).The aedeagus has a pair of long apophyses (Fig. 5H).


## Female

ELYTRA.Apical declivity of elytra with larger punctures in upper part, laterally not marginate, spines on upper margin smaller than in male, apical margin entire.

ABDOMEN.The last ventrite with a deep incision apically, anterior to the incision a very short, high, longitudinal carina, its summit knife-like, its sides with very long, stiff, red setae standing perpendicular to the carina (Fig. 4D), the surface of the sternite with similar hairs.

## Biology

Recorded from pistachio tree wood (Pistacia vera L. (Anacardiaceae R. Br.)) in Iraq, Iran and Pakistan (Lesne 1937;Damoiseau 1968;Halperin 1986;Modarres Awal 1997), and this species appears to be its usual host.It is a secondary pest of pistachio in Israel (Halperin 1986).The species is also recorded in Iran from Quercus sp.(Fagaceae Dumort), Ficus carica L., Morus alba L. (Moraceae Link) (Modarres Awal 1997), and Salix sp.(Salicaceae Mirb.), and in Pakistan from Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce (= spicigera) (Fabaceae Lindl.)(Lesne 1937).Gerstmaier et al. (1999) record Denops albofasciatus (Charpentier, 1825) (Coleoptera, Cleridae) as a predator in Israel.

Xylopertha retusa (Olivier, 1790) Figs 1C-D


## Diagnosis

The species is easily separable from X. praeusta and X. refl exicauda by the absence of spines on the elytra in both sexes.The male can be separated from X. elegans sp.nov.by the presence of long, erect hairs on the upper margin of the elytral declivity (absent in X. elegans sp.nov.), and by the form of the 8 th tergite and genitalia (Fig. 5A-B: X. retusa; Fig. 5E-F: X. elegans sp.nov.).In the female of X. retusa, the apex of each elytron is strongly emarginate, the emargination fi lled by a pair of ventrally-directed processes with rounded tips next to the suture (Fig. 3A); in X. elegans sp.nov., the apex of each elytron projects as a broad, approximately rectangular process, its apex with a small pointed tooth next to the suture, the processes separated by a shallow U-shaped emargination, a broad emargination lateral to each process (Fig. 3C).In the female of X. retusa, the fourth ventrite is visible across its entire width, and the base of the emargination of the 5 th ventrite does not project ventrally (Fig. 4A); in X. elegans sp.nov., the 3 rd abdominal ventrite projects medially over the 4 th , which is visible only at the sides, and the 5 th ventrite is very deeply, broadly emarginate, the base of the emargination projecting as a thin lamina behind the process on the 3 rd ventrite (Fig. 4B).The specifi c identity of more than 800 further specimens was checked in the following museums: IRSNB, MAIC, MIZPAN, MNB, MTM, NHMUK, NMBS, NMPC, NMS, NMW, SDEI, SNSD, ZNHB and ZSM, but detailed locality data were not recorded.All specimens came from the distributional area given below.

The species has been recorded from the wood of trees in the families Fabaceae, Fagaceae, Moraceae, Ulmaceae Mirb.and Vitaceae Juss.(Lesne 1901;Bahillo de la Puebla et al. 2007;Marković & Stojanović 2012;Buse et al. 2013).The species is active from May to July in Southern Europe (Cymorek 1961 as Xylonites retusus; Bahillo de la Puebla et al. 2007), but from October to December in Israel (Buse et al. 2013).In Central Europe, the beetles prefer boring into dry oak branches; the larvae tunnel particularly in the sapwood; they overwinter in diapause and pupate in spring (Cymorek 1961 as Xylonites retusus).Several clerid and a melyrid predators (Coleoptera: Cleridae, Melyridae) are listed by Bahillo de la Puebla et al. (2007).Yu et al. (2012) list three species of braconid Hymenoptera as parasitoids.

Xylopertha praeusta (Germar, 1817) Figs The type material of X. praeusta was not located, but the species is well known in the Mediterranean area.

The senior author has examined numerous specimens determined by Lesne and Vrydagh, and numerous other specimens in IRSNB, LYL, MAIC, MNB, NHMUK, SDEI, SNSD and ZMHB, from various countries in southern Europe and North Africa.Borowski & Singh (2017) examined the type series of Xylopertha dunensis deposited in IFRI, and synonymised X. dunensis with X. praeusta.They state that the specimens in the type series came in fact from Tulon [sic] (correctly Toulon), S-France.It has become apparent that K. Rai falsifi ed the type location of several species that he described (Borowski & Singh 2017).India should, therefore, be excluded from the distribution of X. praeusta.If the species does occur in India, it is almost certainly introduced.


## Diagnosis

The species is distinguished from X. elegans sp.nov.and X. retusa by the presence of a spine on each elytron in both sexes (Fig. 1).It is distinguished from X. refl exicauda by the position of the spine, which is on the dorso-lateral margin of the declivity in X. praeusta, but on the middle of the upper margin of the declivity in X. refl exicauda.Differences in the abdomen and genitalia are illustrated in Figs 4 and 5.The specifi c identity of more than 260 further specimens was checked in the following museums: IRSNB, MAIC, MIZPAN, MNB, MTM, NHMUK, NMBS, NMPC, NMS, NMW, SDEI, SNSD, ZNHB and ZSM, but detailed locality data were not recorded.All specimens came from the distributional area given below.


## Material examined


## Description

BODY. 4-8 mm long, about 2.5-2.8 times as long as wide, stout, parallel-sided.Body shiny, head, pronotum, ventral side and femora black; elytral disc dark brown, darker toward the declivity; tibiae dark brown, antennae and tarsi paler.

HEAD.Clypeus fi nely and densely punctured, convex along its anterior margin, its median truncation as wide as base of labrum.Frons with puncturation less dense than clypeus, covered by fairly long, upwardly directed hairs.First and second segments of antennal club slightly elongate.Fifth antennal segment often nicked on external side, but this is not constant, nor particular to one sex.Pronotum about 1.1 times wider than long, narrowed in anterior third, without long hairs antero-laterally, area above the head fi nely punctured.

ELYTRA.Puncturation dense and strong on whole of disc; elytral declivity with a tubercle-like spine with a pointed apex located on dorso-lateral margin of declivity of each elytron (Figs 1E-F, 3B); pubescence of apical declivity short, erect, reddish, especially noticeable near upper margin where formed of longer hairs.

LEGS.External face of anterior tibiae narrowly grooved, widened to apex.Second and third segments of anterior tarsi scarcely wider than the following ones.

Male ELYTRA.Apical declivity larger than in female, covered by an exceedingly fi ne and dense puncturation, and often wrinkled in its upper part; elytral spine robust, directed inwardly, strongly bulbous on outer side at base, narrow and very pointed at apex, below it a broad fl ange beginning at sutural angle and extending at sides to about level of lateral spine; sutural angles not projecting, rounded at apex (Fig. 1E).

ABDOMEN.Anterior margin of 8 th tergite wider and fringed by shorter erect hairs than in X. retusa.Genitalia more strongly sclerotised than in X. retusa, with pair of ventrally-directed processes with pointed tips next to inner lobes which are separated by a U-shaped emargination in middle.Aedeagus simple, without long apophyses (Fig. 5C-D).


## Female

ELYTRA.Declivity less distinctly truncate than in the male, strongly punctured, the lateral spines smaller, or replaced by tubercles; suture infl ated on the declivity (Fig. 1F).Apical emargination of elytra broad, the emargination largely fi lled by a pair of ventrally-directed, extended processes with rounded tips next to suture (Fig. 3B).

ABDOMEN.Last visible segment of abdomen densely pubescent on sides, not grooved in middle; posterior margin of segment armed by two dorsally recurved large median teeth (Fig. 4C).setae cover the whole frons, and are upwardly directed, the posterior margin of the female elytra is strongly emarginate, and the female fi fth ventrite is variously modifi ed.It seems likely that Enneadesmus, Scobicia and Xylogenes evolved a nine-segmented antenna independently from Xylopertha and Psicula.Here, we compared the characters of Xylopertha, Psicula and two other genera, Xylobosca Lesne, 1901 andXylionulus Lesne, 1901, that appear to be related to Xylopertha, in Table 1.


## European Journal of Taxonomy

Xylobosca is distinguished from the other genera considered here by the form of the protibia, which is atypical for Xyloperthini, widest towards the middle rather than at the apex, and lacking a fl at external face.Xylionulus differs from Xylopertha especially in characters of the antennae, the vestiture of the frons and pronotum, and the lack of strong sexual dimorphism.Psicula is the genus most similar to Xylopertha morphologically (Table 1), with very similar characters of the antennae, frons, pronotum and elytra, but the male lacks the pleural pieces on the fi fth abdominal ventrite that are present in Xylopertha.The two genera also have nearly adjacent geographical distributions, Xylopertha extending through the Mediterranean region as far East as Pakistan, and Psicula recorded in North-East India (Sikkim, West Bengal).

The tribe Xyloperthini is greatly in need of revision and further phylogenetic analysis.There are at present no molecular studies of any tribe of Bostrichidae, and much progress may be made in the future using molecular methods.Liu & Schönitzer (2011) suggest that the tribe Xyloperthini is polyphyletic, but their study included only nine genera.A study including as many genera as possible is needed.The geographical distribution of the tribe covers all zoogeographic regions except the Arctic-Siberian, although most species occur in the Palaearctic and Afrotropical regions.A preliminary analysis of the phylogeography of the family suggests that it originated in Gondwana rather than Laurasia (Liu 2016).The genera currently included in the tribe Xyloperthini appear to have multiple geographical origins (Liu, unpublished), again suggesting polyphyly.The present paper is the second in a larger project which will try to resolve some of these problems.

(Adoxaceae E.Mey.), Mangifera L., Pistacia (Anacardiaceae), Acacia Mill.(Fabaceae), Castanea Mill., Quercus L. (Fagaceae), Ficus L. (Moraceae), Eucalyptus L'Hér.(Myrtaceae Juss.), Populus L. (Salicaceae), Vitex L. (Vitaceae Juss.)(Lesne 1901;Rai & Chatterjee 1964;Akşit et al. 2005;Buse et al. 2013).However, it develops primarily in oaks (Quercus) (Bahillo de laPuebla et al. 2007;Nardi & Mifsud 2015).In Europe, adults emerge in May-July(Lesne 1901), but are active until November in Israel(Buse et al. 2013).The species has diurnal habits.The gallery system is typical of the genus.Larvae overwinter and complete their development in the spring of the following year(Lesne 1901).Key to species of Xylopertha1.
