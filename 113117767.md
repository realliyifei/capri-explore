In recent years, frequent fires in universities indicated the shortage of college students' fire safety skills and school construction work of fire, and the fire safety situation is unoptimistic.Therefore doing a good job in the campus fire safety work and reducing the occurrence of fire accidents have become the key work of the construction of the universities now.In this study, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry is taken as the example.The questionnaire on fire knowledge, the operation of the fire safety apparatus, the outline of simulating the situation of fires was performed to explore the college students' knowledge of fire safety and weak links of firefighting..In order to provide a theoretical basis on reducing the heavy casualties and property losses, we combine various potential factors with the current situation of the university fire safety, objectively and scientifically analyses the campus fire safety situation and proposed the corresponding solutions.

## Countermeasures of exploring the status of knowledge and skills of the fire safety of college students


### Survey methods and Data statistics

Methods description: This research takes all the students in Zhengzhou University of Light Industry as the sample and is divided into three parts: the previous survey methods, survey methods and the exploration of data statistical analysis methods, program implementation and feedback, statistics and analysis of the late stage [1] .Through checking the relevant information, this research is decided to carry on by the survey of questionnaire on fire knowledge, the operation of the fire safety apparatus and the outline of simulating the situation of fires [2] .The questionnaire survey is mainly related to the knowledge of fire safety, the use of fire equipment, skills of fire escape and self-help and so on [3] .In this research total of 700 questionnaires had been made and 674 pieces were recovered while 655 were valid.

The survey indicated that 96% of the students obtained basic knowledge of fire safety through the promotion from school and organization of fire-drill but not from the active learning; 68% of the students even felt they the fire is far from them and only need to pay little attention to avoid [4] ; 61% of the students did not take the propaganda and the exercise of school fire safety seriously and did not take the practical methods of the rescue's security theory into consideration [5] .

By setting the fire apparatus operation desk in the restaurant and the school dormitory downstairs, where three groups fifteen times in total were set [6] .And a survey on the use of fire extinguishers, gas masks, fire alarm, fire grille switch, fire knot and fire hose nozzle were performed.The results showed that 62% of the students said they had seen but never use it Die Meng et al. / Procedia Engineering 135 ( 2016 )  25 -28   before; 70% of the students said they had read the instructions of the fire fighting equipment; 32% of students could not finish the operation quickly and accurately [7] .


### Analysis of the data

The situation of campus fire safety is still grim.According to incomplete statistics, during 2006 and 2012 total of 9122 accidents occurred, in which 118 people died and 171 people injured and 63,640,000 RMB was lost.There are nearly thirty million students in colleges in our country.Although the annual meeting of the fire and fire drills were made to popularize the knowledge of fire safety, but get little success.The data of the survey shows that college students' fire safety quality is still low and lack of awareness of fire safety generally.Still a lot of students do not know how to report the fire and help themselves quickly, do not know how to use the fire safety equipment correctly, pay no attention to the safety of channels in campus buildings and are not alert to the fire safety hidden hazards around them.The serious shortage of students' knowledge of the application of fire safety exposed in the survey.


## Weak links of the fire safety work in colleges

Colleges are devoted to improve the ability of preventing and dealing with the fire risks in various ways.However, many objective reasons for accidents of campus fire are still exist.


### The hardware construction of fire fighting and the ineffective managements

Student dormitories are not only the gathering area of students but also a large number of security key areas of electricity use.It is very easy to cause significant casualties and property losses when fire happened, which results in adverse social impact.The colleges develop fast in China in recent years.And a considerable numbers of schools built new campuses, the occurrence of both new and old campus together is hard to avoid problems of differences in line specifications between new campus and old campus, compatibility, and maintain oversight and so on.On the afternoon of October 9, 2013, the storage room in Henan Sixth Middle School of PingDingshan City suddenly caught fire and smoke filled the entire campus.Due to a small range of fire and timely fire alarm, the campus teachers and students in an orderly manner to escape to avoid casualties.It is reported that the cause of the fire is the ignorance of a storage room line inspection and the line aging caused a short circuit fire.


### Weak Fire safety awareness

In recent years, colleges continue to strengthen fire safety education; teachers and students gradually improve the awareness of fire.However, from the research data, college students' awareness of the fire is still in the primary stage.The ability to have the fire supervision consciousness and exclude the fire hazard is far from enough.Although, The Fire Safety Management Regulations, has included the fire education into the education, but the data suggest that most of the students did not really make use of the knowledge.This is related to the form of the content of colleges' propaganda of fire which is single and boring.Publicity and education in the promotion of the board and the implementation of the oral, which ignores the education of students' behavior awareness.Fire safety propaganda becomes boring slogans, resulting in this embarrassing situation of no less publicity exercises and low fire quality.Publicity and education effect greatly reduced.It is difficult to cultivate students' awareness of fire protection, so it is worth to explore the issue of how to cultivate students' subjective initiative of learning the knowledge of fire prevention.


### Emergency treatment norms are not perfect enough

Fire emergency plan for sudden fire.On the basis of analysis to the scene of the fire situation, in order to reduce fire accidents caused by the loss of life and property, carry out emergency rescue quickly and orderly, with the advanced, scientific, effective action plan or scheme.Emergency plan should include emergency disposal measures after the fire, emergency rescue operations, rescue equipment and supplies to protect, post disaster relief and resettlement of personnel and a series of related issues as the operation of the steps.

According to the survey, all the buildings in the campus are posted with fire management regulations, but there are few standardized procedures for emergency treatment when the fire occurred.Emergency plan like the trunk of a tree, it is the guidance document for directing the fire rescue, and plays a decisive role on the disposal of fire and rescue personnel placement.Foliage can not only rely on the trunk, but also leaves and branches, if in the fire for the first time to cut off the
