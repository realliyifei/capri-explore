# community-dwelling OA's access to healthcare through community sector-based linkages. In order to comprehensively survey CCLM designed for community-dwelling OA, the AgeLine (EBSCO) database was searched to review the academic and grey literature regarding programs that link community-dwelling OA from community to clinical sectors. AgeLine focuses on OA, indexing academic and grey literature from disciplines including health sciences, social work, and public policy. 470 publications were included for title/ abstract screening; 24 were assessed for full-text eligibility by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted from two publications; exclusions were due to ineligible intervention (n=9) or setting (n=2); insufficient detail (n=6); full text unavailable (n=5). The sole empirical publication (2021) found that pilot implementation of a pilot linkage program between OA and clinicians was significantly associated with improved medication self-management. A final report (1993) on implementation of a supportive service pilot program in New Hampshire public housing found that OA residents and managers benefitted from the program. Results suggest the benefits of age-friendly CCLM for OA but highlight an existing gap in the literature. The results of this review underscore the need for age-friendly CCLM research, practice and innovation

Adequate hand function is essential for performing daily activities such as eating and dressing, but declines with age.Homebound older adults in particular are at greater risk for losing hand function necessary to remain independent.However, hand function in this population remains largely understudied.The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hands and Health at Home, an intergenerational upper limb-based intervention, improves hand function among homebound Meals on Wheels (MOW) clients.In this program, pre-health college students are trained to deliver a variety of hand strength, dexterity, and sensory exercises to a MOW client twice a week for 8 weeks.In addition, clients are instructed to complete exercises twice a week on their own.Measures of strength, dexterity, and sensation, as well as self-reported hand function are measured before and after the intervention.Preliminary results indicate MOW clients improved their grip strength an average of 42% in the dominant hand and 26% in the nondominant.Approximately 50% of clients improved dexterity (measured via the Purdue Pegboard) in their nondominant hand, and over 65% self-reported increased upper limb mobility.All clients and students valued this hands-on experience with several requesting continued involvement in the program.Results from Hands and Health at Home suggest this intergenerational approach to delivering hand therapy is an effective and mutually beneficial way to serve the needs of homebound older adults in the community and promote student interest in aging careers.
