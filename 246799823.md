resection is recommended. [7] Here, we present the technical intramedullary resection of a craniovertebral junction PA in an adult patient, along with the 2-D intraoperative video.


## CLINICAL PRESENTATION Patient presentation

A 59-year-old female presented with a several month history of progressive right-sided hemi-sensory loss, right-sided hemiparesis (4/5), and gait imbalance. e T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large cystic, loculated lesion that compressed the dorsal aspect of the medulla along with cord signal from C2 to C5 [ Figures 1a-d]. e contrast MRI demonstrated a 1.3 cm homogenously enhancing intramedullary mass centered at C1 and eccentric to the right that expanded the spinal cord. e computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated the course of the vertebral arteries.


## Surgery

e patient was positioned prone on a "Jackson table" with intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring -namely, intraoperative motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), free-running electromyography, and dorsal column mapping -utilized throughout the duration of surgery. e surgeon utilized a surgical microscope and ultrasound to perform a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor. is required a C1-2 laminectomy, 3 cm suboccipital craniectomy, midline myelopathy (i.e., using the dorsal column mapping) [Figures 1e and 2]. During the myelotomy, the anticipated brief decrease in SSEPs occurred. Once the tumor was exposed and grossly removed [ Figure 3],   


## Clinical outcome and pathology

Postoperatively, the patient had preserved motor strength and the expected dorsal column dysfunction, which markedly resolved within 9 months. e postoperative MRI scans demonstrated GTR of the tumor and dynamic X-rays confirmed no atlantoaxial or atlanto-occipital instability [ Figure 4]. e tumor was identified as PA (WHO Grade I), and therefore, no further adjuvant treatment was indicated. [2,4] 


## DISCUSSION

Primary PA of the spine is extremely rare, particularly among adults, and GTR is the standard of care. [2] In our case, the entire solid tumor mass was resected and resulted in the spontaneous regression of the cyst (i.e., without direct removal of the cyst walls). Accurately locating the midline for the myelotomy helps to circumvent inadvertent dissection through the dorsal columns, which would result in postoperative sensory deficits. [8] However, if the surgeon does not have access to dorsal column mapping, the midline can be identified anatomically by appreciating the confluence of pial vessels. In addition to the use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring during the resection of the tumor, other precautions can be implemented to prevent over-manipulation of the dorsal columns. e tumor can be debulked utilizing microdissection to establish the tumorspinal cord plane before retracting the dorsal columns. [8] A brief reduction in SSEPs typically occurs after myelotomies for intramedullary lesions. Hence, patients should be counseled prior to surgery that they may in fact have a new dorsal column dysfunction after surgery. Further, preoperative CTAs are important to identify potentially aberrant courses of the vertebral and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries. In addition, if instrumentation is not applied following the C1-2 laminectomy, careful dynamic X-ray and CT studies should be successively performed to detect the late onset of instability.


## CONCLUSION

In this technical note, we presented the surgical approach to resect an intramedullary occiput-C1-C2 PA.
