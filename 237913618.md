## INTRODUCTION

Industry 4.0, a term raised by the German Government in 2011, has as main focus to apply advanced technologies at the production level, aiming at increasing the flexibility, speed and quality of production systems (Khan & Turowski, 2016). These advanced technologies, such as, additive manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and cloud computing, if integrated, will bring about major changes in the way society organizes, relates, consumes and produces products and services (Manyika et al., 2013).

The term Big Data can be defined as the existence of large data sets and that need adequate tools to deal with this large volume of data and from this medium, information can be extracted for decision making (Morais et al., 2018 ).

According to Shivappa et al. (2018) Big Data has three main characteristics or dimensions, described as: the volume defined as a set of data whose size is beyond the processing capacity of a conventional database; the speed that is the ability to acquire, process, understand and interpret data in real time; and the variety in which it refers to the number of data types, such as messages, photos, videos and sounds. Morais et al. (2018) still include two more dimensions: veracity (constant need for real-time analysis) and value (indicates that the greater the wealth of data, the better the questions will be at the beginning of the analysis process).

Faced with this technological revolution, which appears to be applied with greater proportion in the manufacturing industry, Agriculture 4.0 (including precision agriculture and agriculture) is also present, which uses techniques from industry 4.0 to maximize the use of natural resources for food production (Ribeiro et al., 2012). Big data and cloud computing techniques have been widely used in agriculture 4.0, with the objective of providing better decision-making for increasing productivity (Franco & Domenech, 2014 1,430,156 in 2017, that is, an increase of more than 1900% or almost 20 times more. In addition, the evolution is marked by 659 thousand accesses by broadband and 909 thousand accesses by mobile internet.

With that, the hypothesis was raised that there is a large volume of information in agriculture that needs to be treated, in order to improve the forecasts in the segment, however it is unknown which tools help in this tabulation.

From the understanding of the concept of Big Data, the question that motivated this research arose, described as: "Currently, what are the innovations and technologies, connected to Big Data, used in agriculture?".

The study is justified from the need to understand how Big Data can be used outside the industrial context, and yes, in other segments in order to understand the customer's needs, in addition to improving production processes. Another point, which is necessary to understand, is whether this technological advent with high data processing, Big Data, is at what level within agriculture and in which approach has been applied. Therefore, the objective of this study is to carry out a systematic review of the literature regarding current issues that address the use of Big Data in the context of Agriculture.

For this, the article is divided into 4 sections, the first of which brings an introduction on the topic; the second addresses the research methodology; in the third are the results and discussion on the topic; and the fourth section presents the final considerations.


## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

The proposed research has a qualitative nature and relates the uses and problems of Big Data in the area of Agriculture, using the method described by Tranfield et al. (2003). This method suggests three main steps, namely: research planning, with the definition of parameters; searching and extracting articles from the databases; and the analysis and synthesis of the selected works, highlighting the results verified by each author.


## Search parameter definitions

The search was carried out electronically on the Web of Science and Scopus databases, which are reference platforms for citations, accessed through the CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior) journal portal.

In the base, the advanced search and the Boolean operator "AND" were used, in addition, as search criteria, the terms "Big Data" and "Agricul *" were first used, which were searched for in the title field of the articles. Other delimitations used were in relation to the language, timing and type of document in which English was selected, the last 4 years (2016 to 2019) and article, respectively. It is important to highlight that the term "Agricul*" was used to broaden the research, as it was possible to select articles with the terms "Agricultural" and "Agriculture".

The selection using the Web of Science and Scopus database resulted in 38 (thirty-eight) and 35 (thirty-five) articles, respectively. Removing articles in duplicates and those that did not fit the delimited theme, 47 (forty-seven) articles remained. The Chart 1 shows the number of articles found in each database per year, and the number of duplicate, excluded and inserted articles. 


## Presentation and analysis of results

Regarding the year of publication (  Regarding the title of the articles, a word cloud was created (Figure 2), using the software R (2020). This cloud was formed by all 47 articles. In addition to the words referenced in the search, no other appeared with great prominence. The search terms were counted with the following frequency: "Data" appears 49 times, "big" 44, "agricultural" 21, "agriculture" 21.

Other most cited terms were "analysis" 8, "analytics" 6 and "precision" 6, the other terms had frequency less than 5.  


## RESULTS

In order to identify how the application of Big Data analysis can enhance innovations for agriculture, the current scenario, the challenges to be overcome and perspectives for the sector, a synthesis of the 47 selected articles was made highlighting the main contributions of each study for the theme, as shown in Chart 2.

Chart 2: Summary of the searched articles. Source: The authors (2020) As shown in Chart 2 of the summary of the articles selected above, the use of Big Data promotes a huge set of possibilities in the field of agriculture, from increasing productivity to risk management. Shivappa et al. (2018) state that the agriculture sector currently has technology similar to the latest generation industrial sector, using GPS equipped with sensors, e-tablets and drones, in addition to also taking advantage of the power of the Internet of Things and Big Data in all its agricultural value chain.

Due to climatic seasonality, data analysis is the most used technique in agriculture to help in the optimization of scarce resources such as water, fertilizers and micronutrients (Priya & Geetha, 2017), as well as in helping to select the best performing genotypes for cultivation (Bhogireddy et al., 2016).

In addition to the aforementioned, it is also noted that with the growth of the advent of Big Data, in which tools routinely monitor and collect information from animals and farms, several methods of analysis need to be used, to efficiently extract and summarize the main information, thus, machine learning and data mining methods have been widely used (Majumdar et al., 2017).

With regard to machine learning, which is the second most used method in agriculture in the context of Big Data and which is capable of making predictions from a set of data, its applications are diverse, such as facilitating production decisions livestock (White et al., 2018), improve accuracy in the geographical location of farms (Gumma et al., 2019) and identify the best place and the right time to cultivate a particular crop (Jiang et al., 2019).

As Morota et al. (2018), machine learning can be combined with data mining for applications involving agriculture, such as genome prediction, identification of outliers of a certain group of animals and detection of mastitis (disease that affects the health of dairy cattle). The machine learning method is also used in equipment with Internet of Things technology and sensors, which monitor the environmental factors of a farm, such as soil temperature and humidity, in order to answer whether a crop is suitable for cultivation (Tseng et al., 2019).

According to Zhang & Liu (2019), in agriculture, the IoT assists in data collection, transmission and monitoring. Examples of this application are the use of sensors that capture environmental data in real time, being: images of the climate in the agricultural area.

Therefore, the application of IoT in agriculture also supports the collection of meteorological data, such as: temperature, air humidity, light intensity, among others. This means that those responsible can be alerted to the weather, disasters and thus reduce the losses related to possible damage, since this technology has an effective response speed.

There are also initiatives to structure online tools that allow interested parties and decision makers to view and analyze data on agriculture, facilitating policy formulation.

On the other hand, according to Shivappa et al. (2018), there are some challenges to be overcome for the full exploitation of agriculture combined with Big Data, which are: digital literacy, internet access and its speed and lack of participation by companies and private industries.


# CONCLUSION

Traditional software cannot process the amount of information and variables in data sets, Big Data, so it is necessary to search for ways to correctly mine this data, understand what is present on the internet and use it in favor of the business in the competitive market.

Understanding the consumer's needs is necessary in any type of business, including agriculture, in addition, decision making cannot cause negative impacts on the process or on the final product. In addition, the collaboration of professionals in computer science, economics, engineering, mathematics and statistics is necessary, together with the industry, to efficiently develop approaches to analyze high volume of data.

Thus, the objective of this work was to carry out a systematic review of the literature regarding the current issues that address the use of Big Data in the context of agriculture. In Knowing all these technologies related to Big Data, which are used in agriculture in first world countries, serve as a reference for innovative practices for agricultural companies, who wish to improve their current production processes (AS-IS), through the application of technologies emerging, thus generating highly competitive future processes (TO-BE).

As a suggestion for future work, it is interesting to understand how is the Big Data approach in Brazil, focused on agriculture and perform a comparative analysis to identify existing technologies, as well as the projection of technological advent in the area.
