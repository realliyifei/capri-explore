Identifying the young optically visible population in a star-forming region is essential for fully understanding the star formation event. In this paper, We identify 211 candidate members of the Perseus molecular cloud based on Gaia astronomy. We use LAMOST spectra to confirm that 51 of these candidates are new members, bringing the total census of known members to 856. The newly confirmed members are less extincted than previously known members. Two new stellar aggregates are identified in our updated census. With the updated member list, we obtain a statistically significant distance gradient of 4.84 pc deg −1 from west to east. Distances and extinction corrected color-magnitude diagrams indicate that NGC 1333 is significantly younger than IC 348 and the remaining cloud regions. The disk fraction in NGC 1333 is higher than elsewhere, consistent with its youngest age. The star formation scenario in the Perseus molecular cloud is investigated and the bulk motion of the distributed population is consistent with the cloud being swept away by the Per-Tau Shell.

stellar populations and for estimating the star formation rates (e.g., Hsieh & Lai 2013;Young et al. 2015;Mercimek et al. 2017). Previous studies identified YSOs mainly based on their infrared (IR) excess emission (e.g., Harvey et al. 2007;Evans et al. 2007) or elevated X-ray emission (Stelzer et al. 2012). Various colorcolor diagrams (CCDs) and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are efficient in selecting sources with IR excess emission. However, these selections are always contaminated by non-YSO sources, such as broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), star-forming galaxies, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, that have similar IR properties as YSOs (Robitaille et al. 2008;Koenig et al. 2012;Manara et al. 2018;Herczeg et al. 2019;Lee et al. 2021). In addition, these CCDs and CMDs are inefficient in selecting evolved YSOs without circumstellar material, which have similar colors as main-sequence stars.

Accurate astrometric measurements from the Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016) have changed this situation. With measurements of its distance and proper motion of individual sources, membership can be assessed directly, without any assumptions for the source properties. Different methods have been developed to identify new members in nearby star-forming regions, based on Gaia astrometric data, including the following examples. Using the dataset from Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018), Cánovas et al. (2019) identified 166 new candidates in the ρ Ophiuchi region applying different clustering algorithms, including DBSCAN (Ester et al. 1996), HDBSCAN (Campello et al. 2013(Campello et al. , 2015McInnes et al. 2017) and OPTICS (Ankerst et al. 1999). Also in the ρ Ophiuchi region, Grasser et al. (2021) identified additional ∼200 new YSO candidates applying the OCSVM algorithm developed by Ratzenböck et al. (2020), based on the dataset from Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021). Apply-ing a simple thresholding method and utilizing the dataset from Gaia DR2, Luhman (2018) refined the sample of known members and identified new candidates in the Taurus star formingregion, Kubiak et al. (2021) increased the census of known Cha members by more than 40%. Both simple thresholding methods and clustering algorithms are powerful tools for identifying new members with high reliability in nearby star-forming regions.

The Perseus molecular cloud is one of the nearest (∼300 pc from the Sun, Ortiz-León et al. (2018)) low mass star-forming regions (Reipurth 2008). It is a well-studied starforming region (e.g., Sargent 1979;Ladd et al. 1993;Kirk et al. 2006;Ridge et al. 2006a;Enoch et al. 2007;Arce et al. 2010) with a range of star-forming environments, both clustered (e.g., the two young clusters NGC 1333 and IC 348) and distributed, as well as several small dense clumps (B1, B5, L1448 and L1455) of the type that often produce one or a few stars (Young et al. 2015). The Perseus molecular cloud has been observed in multi-wavelength studies (e.g., X-ray: Winston et al. 2010;Alexander & Preibisch 2011;Optical: Zhang et al. 2015;IR: Young et al. 2015;sub-millimeter: Kirk et al. 2006;Enoch et al. 2007; radio: Ridge et al. 2006a;Arce et al. 2010). Many YSOs have been identified in this region previously (Evans et al. 2009;Hsieh & Lai 2013;Young et al. 2015). In a census of members of IC 348 and NGC 1333 using multi-epoch IRAC astrometry, Luhman et al. (2016) identified many members in the two clusters. However, for the remaining cloud regions, only IR excess emission was used to select large samples of YSO candidates (YSOc) (Evans et al. 2009;Hsieh & Lai 2013;Young et al. 2015), so many undiscovered YSOs without disks may be present in the remaining cloud regions. Recently, Pavlidou et al. (2021) identified five new groups in the Perseus star-forming complex based on the astrometric data from Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018), but they mainly focused on the off-cloud regions specifically, instead of the main cloud regions outside the two young clusters.

In this paper, we use the Gaia astrometry and photometry to identify candidate members in the Perseus molecular cloud, especially in the remaining cloud regions outside the two clusters, and use the LAMOST spectroscopic survey to confirm memberships of these candidates. We describe the datasets used in this work in Section 2, and the source selection procedures in Section 3. The results are presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. We give our summaries and conclusions in Section 6.


## THE DATASETS


### Gaia Data

We use the astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia survey (Gaia EDR3) (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021;Riello et al. 2021;Fabricius et al. 2021) to identify new candidates in the Perseus molecular cloud. We consider only the main cloud region that is covered by the 12 CO J=1→0 map from the COMPLETE (Coordinated Molecular Probe Line Extinction and Thermal Emission) Survey of Star-Forming Regions (Ridge et al. 2006b), corresponding to 157 • < l < 161.2 • and −22.2 • < b < −16.2 • . Gaia satellite provides us with very accurate astrometric measurements of almost two billion sources, including ∼60,000 within our survey area.

Based on the previously proposed distances to the Perseus molecular cloud, we include only sources with parallaxes between 2.2 and 5.0 mas, corresponding to distances of about 200 to 450 pc. Only sources whose observations are consistent with the five-parameter model ) are retained for further analysis, that is we keep only sources with ruwe < 1.4 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021;Lindegren 2018). Additional quality cuts are applied to extract sources with high quality astrometry and photometry. Only sources with parallaxes over errors larger than 5 and with proper motion errors less than 0.5 mas are considered to produce astrometrically precise and reliable dataset. Sources with magnitude errors in G-or RP -bands larger than 0.1 mag are removed to produce high-quality catalog. With these cuts, we extract about 3000 Gaia sources with high quality toward the direction of the Perseus molecular cloud.


### Optical Spectroscopic Data from The LAMOST Survey

We use the spectroscopic data from the data release 7 of the LAMOST survey (LAMOST DR7) (Luo et al. 2022) to confirm memberships of the candidates in the cloud. LAMOST, the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (also called the Guo Shoujing Telescope), is a quasi-meridian Schmidt telescope located at Xinglong Observatory Station in Hebei, China. The telescope has an effective aperture of 3.6−4.9 m and a field of view of about 5 • in diameter. The telescope is equipped with 16 spectrographs and 4000 fibers, each spectrograph has a resolution of ∼2.5Å, and the wavelength coverage is 3690−9100Å (Cui et al. 2012;Zhao et al. 2012;Liu et al. 2015).

LAMOST DR7 contains more than 10 million spectra, more than 9.5 million of which are stellar spectra. In the direction of the Perseus molecular cloud, LAMOST obtained more than 9000 spectra of about 5500 distinct sources.


### Additional Ancillary Data

The Perseus molecular cloud has been well covered by many large-sky surveys, including Pan-STARRS1 (Hodapp et al. 2004), 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006), WISE (Wright et al. 2010). The Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) survey images the whole sky in five broadband filters, grizy, with a wavelength coverage from 0.4 to 1 µm (Stubbs et al. 2010). We retrieve the griz pho-tometry from the PS1 DR1 catalog (Chambers et al. 2016). Sources that are brighter than 14 mag 1 or that have magnitude errors larger than 0.05 mag, in r or i filters, are removed to avoid saturation problems and to produce high-quality catalog. The JHK S magnitudes are retrieved from the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalog (Skrutskie et al. 2003) which reaches limiting magnitudes of 15.8, 15.1 and 14.3 mag at 10σ for J, H and K S -bands respectively (Skrutskie et al. 2006). The WISE survey is a mid-infrared full-sky survey undertaken in four bands: W 1, W 2, W 3 and W 4 bands with wavelengths centered at 3.35, 4.60, 11.56 and 22.09 µm, respectively (Wright et al. 2010). We take the WISE photometry from the AllWISE source catalog (Wright et al. 2019) to determine the presence or absence of circumstellar disks around YSOs.


## SOURCE SELECTION


### Census from Previous Studies

Luhman et al. (2016) compiled a thorough census for the two young clusters, and provided samples of 478 and 203 sources with well-confirmed memberships for IC 348 and NGC 1333, respectively. Beginning with this tabulation, we search the literature for additional members in the Perseus molecular cloud, especially in the regions outside the two clusters, with spectroscopically confirmed memberships. We add to our sample the 8 and 2 members identified by Esplin & Luhman (2017) and Luhman & Hapich (2020), respectively. From the Kounkel et al. (2019) search for close companions around young stars, we include in our census the 114 members that have radial velocities between 0 and 25 km s −1 . This velocity range is consistent with the radial velocities of members in IC 348  and NGC 1333 . Kounkel et al. 1 see https://panstarrs.stsci.edu/ (2019) reported radial velocity of 143 km s −1 for the source 2MASS J03453345+3145553, but Cottaar et al. (2015) reported radial velocity of around 20 km s −1 from multiple observations, so we retain this object in our member list. Combining all these tabulations together, we arrive at a sample of 805 known members with spectroscopically confirmed memberships in the Perseus molecular cloud.

Cross-matching this list of known members with the Gaia catalog described in Section 2.1, using 2 tolerance, we obtain astrometric and photometric measurements for 406 known members (∼50% of the sample). It is not surprising that about half of the known members are not matched with the Gaia catalog, since that we consider only sources with high-quality Gaia measurements as described in Section 2.1. We would obtain 598 matches, i.e., ∼75% of the sample, if no quality cuts were applied to the Gaia catalog. In addition, many of the known members are either too faint (∼150 members in our sample are fainter than J = 16 mag, all without matches in the Gaia catalog) or too embedded (∼60 members in the census are deeply embedded class 0/I protostars) to be observed by the Gaia satellite.

Visually inspecting the properties of the 406 matched members, we find that the bulk of these members share common distances, motions and ages, with limited scatter, as expected from their memberships. Figure 1 displays the distributions of parallax and proper motions, as well as the G − RP versus G color-magnitude diagram for these matched known members.

In the parallax distribution in Figure 1, nearly all members have parallaxes within the 3-σ interval from the weighted mean parallax. The weighted mean and the weighted standard deviation of the parallax are = 3.29 mas and σ = 0.19 mas, respectively, calculated by adopting the inverse of the parallax errors as the weight for each parallax. In the proper motion distribution in Figure 1, 394 of the matched members have proper motions within the 3-σ confidence ellipse (the red ellipse in the plot). The confidence ellipse is calculated as follows. Visually inspecting the distribution of the proper motions, we identify six sources with extreme proper motions (outside the viewing range of the plot). In fact, these outliers are companions around young stars (Kounkel et al. 2019). The weighted means and the weighted standard deviations of the proper motion are µ * α = 5.3 mas yr −1 , µ δ = −7.2 mas yr −1 and σ µ * α = 1.43 mas yr −1 , σ µ δ = 1.54 mas yr −1 , respectively, calculated by adopting the inverse of the proper motion errors as the weight for each proper motion, excluding the six extreme cases. We also calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.7 between µ * α and µ δ excluding the six extreme cases, considering measurement uncertainties of both axis, by using the Monte Carlo method proposed by Curran (2014). Using the weighted means, the weighted standard deviations and the correlation coefficient, we construct the 3-σ confidence ellipse.

From the CMD in Figure 1, we find that all but one members are above or around the 10 Myr isochrone from the PARSEC stellar model (Bressan et al. 2012) with solar metallicity, scaled to a distance of 300 pc. The only source well below the 10 Myr isochrone is 2MASS J03291082+3116427. Considering its location on the CMD and the presence of a disk (Luhman et al. 2016), this object is likely harboring an edge-on disk.


### Candidates and New Members

In the previous section, we find that nearly all the known members have parallaxes within the 3-σ of the median parallax for the Perseus members and have proper motions within the 3-σ confidence ellipse, as well as that all members are above or around the 10 Myr isochrone. Based on these statistical properties of the known members, we identify new candidates from the Gaia catalog. Specifically, we select a source as a new candidate if it has parallax between 2.71 and 3.87 mas and its proper motion is within the 3-σ confidence ellipse defined in the previous section. We also require that the candidate is above the 10 Myr isochrone. As the PARSEC stellar model does not extend down to masses below the hydrogen burning limit, we artificially extend the 10 Myr isochrone vertically to include low mass members. This extension line fits the low mass members fairly well. With these constraints, we select 211 additional candidate members from the Gaia catalog. Kounkel et al. (2022) studied the Per OB2 association using Gaia EDR3, applying the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN (Campello et al. 2013(Campello et al. , 2015McInnes et al. 2017). In the same region as studied in our work, they discovered 129 new candidate members. In this work, we recover most of these candidates 2 , and identified 109 new YSO candidates. These sources are distributed in the regions with low YSO surface density (∼ 50 deg −2 ), and are missed by the HDBSCAN algorithm used in Kounkel et al. (2022).

By cross matching with the LAMOST archive, we obtain optical spectra for 55 candidates. Of these candidates, 38 have broad Hα emission lines (characteristic of ongoing accretion activities (Hartmann et al. 1994;Muzerolle et al. 2001)) or Li i λ 6707Å absorption lines (indicator of youth) in their optical spectra (as shown in Figure 2), indicating that they are bona fide members of the Perseus molecular cloud. Detailed analyses of these emission lines and corresponding accretion activities will be presented in a future paper (Wang, X.-L. et al., in preparation). For the remaining 17 candidates, we did not detect significant emission lines or Li i λ 6707Å absorption lines in their optical spectra. These 17 candidates include 8 A-type, 4 F-type, 2 G-type, 1 K-type and 2 M-type stars (see Section 4.1 for details of the spectral classification) and most of them show clear Hα absorption lines in their optical spectra. Inspecting their locations on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram, we confirm 13 of them as young members. The remain-  ing four objects are classified as main-sequence (MS) stars or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and are rejected from our list of candidates (see Section 5.1 for a discussion).

In summary, we identify 211 candidate members sharing common distances, motions and ages in the Perseus molecular cloud and confirm 51 of them as bona fide members, based on evidences of youth, including the presence of emission lines and Li i λ 6707Å absorption lines in their optical spectra, and their locations on the H-R diagram. We confirm more than 90% (51/55) of the candidates having LAM-OST spectra as Perseus members. These new members and candidates are listed in Table 1  .

The two rectangles mark the sky coverage of the two clusters as defined in Rebull et al. (2007), note that the cluster regions adopted here are slightly different from that in Luhman et al. (2016). The scale bar on the left bottom shows a size of 2 pc at a distance of 300 pc. The large solid circle and the dashed ellipse mark the stellar aggregates discussed in Section 5.2. lar bands), the LAMOST pipeline (Wu et al. 2011;Luo et al. 2015) may give incorrect spectral types during the chi-square fitting procedures. Thus, for objects with automated spectral types from the LAMOST pipeline later than K0, we measured spectral type from the LAMOST spectra by applying the classification scheme from Fang et al. (2017), which focuses on specific spectral features (i.e., VO, TiO and CaH-bands). For sources with earlier types, we adopt the spectral classifications from the LAM-OST archive directly. To test the validity of these classification schemes, we apply these classification schemes to a sub-sample of the known members that have been observed by LAMOST as well. The spectral types obtained here and that from the literature are consistent with each other ( Figure 4) . The distributions of spectral types for previously known and newly confirmed members are displayed in Figure 5. Most of the new members are late K and M types. Although we identify many A-, F-and G-type members, the overall distribution of the spectral types remains unchanged. Due to the sensitivity of the LAMOST survey, we did not select any new members later than about M6.


### Extinction Corrections

The extinction of each star is determined individually. Intrinsic g −r, r −i, i−z, z −J, J −H, H − K S colors are estimated with corresponding spectral types for the stars with determined

The solid line indicates the line of equality, and the dashed lines mark differences of 3 sub-types. spectral types. For sources later than F0, the relationship from Fang et al. (2017) is adopted, and for earlier type stars that from Covey et al. (2007) is used. These intrinsic colors are converted from the SDSS photometric system to the Pan-STARRS1 photometric system (Tonry et al. 2012), and the extinction values are determined, combining with observed colors and the extinction law from Wang & Chen (2019).

For sources lacking determined spectral types, we can only roughly determine their extinctions with the method described in Fang et al. (2013), in which the extinctions are obtained by employing the H − K S versus J − H color-color diagram. Observed J − H and H − K S colors are compared to intrinsic colors of main-sequence stars (Bessell & Brett 1988) and T Tauri stars (Meyer et al. 1997), and extinction values are estimated for individual stars, using the extinction law from Wang & Chen (2019) (see Figure 6). The typical error of the extinction val- ues in V -band is ∼0.6 mag and may be higher for stars with accretion disks.
B A F G K 0 K 2 K 4 K 6 K 8 M 0 M 2 M 4 M 6 M 8 L Spectral Type
These extinction values are listed in Table 1 and displayed in Figure 7. The median values of extinction for previously known members, new members and candidates are A V = 3.6, 2.2 and 2.2 mag, respectively. A two sample KS-test also indicates that newly confirmed members and candidates have smaller extinction values than previously known sources. This result is consistent with the fact that most of our newly confirmed members and candidates are spread evenly across the cloud, located at less extincted regions, while most previous searches focused on the two clusters.


## DISCUSSION


### Membership Confirmations

We assess memberships for about 70% of the candidates having LAMOST spectra as bona fide members based on the existence of Hα emission lines or Li i λ 6707Å absorption lines in their optical spectra in Section 3.2. Similar as in Cieza et al. (2012), we assess memberships for the remaining candidates having LAMOST spectra, but lacking emission lines or Li i λ 6707Å absorption lines in their optical spectra, according to their locations on the H-R diagram in this section. To construct the H-R diagram, we convert the spectral types to effective temperatures using the empirical relations determined by Fang et al. (2017) for members later than F0-types and by Pecaut & Mamajek (2013) for earlier type members. The observed J magnitudes are dereddened using the extinction values determined in Section 4.2 and distance corrected assuming distances of 300 pc for all sources (see the red filled histogram in panel (a) in Figure 1). The stellar luminosities are then calculated as following.
log L L = − BC J + M J − M bol, 2.5 (1)
where M J is the extinction corrected absolute J magnitude, BC J is the bolometric correction in J band, M bol, is the bolometric magnitude of the Sun. We take M bol, = 4.755 mag (Mamajek 2012) in this work. The BC J values from Fang et al. (2017) are adopted for spectral types later than F0 and that from Pecaut & Mamajek (2013) for earlier spectral types. As shown in the H-R diagram (Figure 8), sources having emission lines or Li i λ 6707Å absorption lines in their optical spectra are all above or around the 10 Myr isochrone, as expected from their memberships. Among the remaining 17 objects lacking emission lines or Li i λ 6707Å absorption lines in their optical spectra, 13 are located above or around the 10 Myr isochrone and are consistent with being members in the Perseus molecular cloud, 3 are well below the 10 Myr isochrone (marked with open diamonds), and are likely to be field main sequence stars, and one object is well above the stellar birth line (marked with square) and is a possible AGB star.


### Stellar Surface Densities and Substructures in the Perseus Cloud

YSOs tend to form in clusters and are expected to have higher surface densities than field stars. As mentioned above, there are both clustered and distributed star formation in the Perseus molecular cloud. We have divided the cloud into three regions (i.e., NGC 1333, IC 348 and the remaining cloud regions, following Re- . We calculate the stellar surface densities Σ for individual YSOs as (Casertano & Hut 1985),
Σ = n − 1 πr 2 n(2)
where n is the nth nearest star and r n is the distance to the nth nearest star. We adopt n = 6 as a surface density reference, the same as that used in Gutermuth et al. (2009). The resulting stellar surface density distributions are shown in Figure 9 for different cloud regions. The median densities are 3298, 4368 and 42 deg −2 in IC 348, NGC 1333 and the remaining cloud regions, respectively, if only confirmed members (previously known members and newly confirmed members) are included in the density calculations. The stellar surface densities are much higher in the two clusters than in the remaining cloud regions. The star formation environment in the remaining cloud regions is different from that in the clustered regions. The remaining cloud regions represent an environment for distributed star formation. Including the candidate members in the calculation does not change the stellar surface densities in the cluster regions (3236 and 4378 deg −2 for IC 348 and NGC 1333 respectively), but nearly doubles the stellar density in the remaining cloud regions (69 deg −2 ).

Visual inspection of Figure 3 shows two additional groupings of YSO(c)s with enhanced stellar densities outside the main clusters IC 348 and NGC 1333. The stellar aggregate toward the western part of the cloud consists of 6 known members, 10 new members and 12 new candidates. This group is associated with the dark cloud L1448 (Lynds 1962) and was originally identified by Pavlidou et al. (2021), who named the group Autochthe. The stellar aggregate to the east of NGC 1333 consists of 14 known members, 2 new members and 6 new candidates. This group is associated with the dark cloud Barnard 1 (Barnard 1919) and we designate it as "Barnard 1 group". These small groups represent the type of star formation that produce a few stars. The stellar densities for Autochthe and the "Barnard 1 group" are included in Figure 9, these density distributions are consistent with the peaks in the distributions for the remaining cloud regions.

We also perform the density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN (Ester et al. 1996) on our dataset for further examination. When only confirmed members are considered, the algorithm returns 3 clusters, i.e., IC 348, NGC 1333 and Autochthe. The algorithm returned 4 clusters, i.e., IC 348, NGC 1333, Autochthe and "Barnard 1 group", when the candidates iden- and Autochthe (blue bars). Right: the same as in the left panel, but for densities including candidate members. The red bars indicate "Barnard 1 group" found in Section 5.2 and marked in Figure 3, stacked on top of that for Autochthe. tified in this work are included in the input dataset. These results are consistent with our visual inspection.


### Distance Gradient

A single distance can not describe the whole cloud accurately, due to the complex structures of the Perseus molecular cloud. Ortiz-León et al. (2018) (Lombardi et al. 2010). A distance of 250 pc toward the Perseus molecular cloud have been widely used by various studies (e.g., Young et al. 2015;Zhang et al. 2015;Enoch et al. 2006).

In this work, we identify about 200 new members and candidates in the Perseus molecular cloud outside the two clusters, and these members spread nearly evenly across the cloud. With these distributed YSOs, as well as the clustered YSOs, we explore potential distance gradient toward the cloud. We measure distances of 310 pc and 291 pc toward IC 348 and NGC 1333, respectively, consistent with that measured by Ortiz-León et al. (2018) within 1sigma. In Figure 10, we plot the changes of distances along the right ascension direction for all members. We also calculate the median distances of all members in corresponding right ascension bins. As shown in Figure 10, the cloud is getting closer toward us gradually, from east to west. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between right ascension and distance is |ρ| = 0.88 with p = 0.4%, indicating statistically significant correlation between right ascension and distance and that the distance gradient is real. The distance gradient is 4.84 pc deg −1 from NGC 1333 toward IC 348. Sargent (1979) found a smoothly varying LSR velocity across the cloud from their CO observations, and Enoch et al. (2006) pointed out that there may also be a distance gradient across the cloud given the velocity gradient. However, we are unable to convert the LSR velocity gradient to a distance gradient directly, since the Perseus molecular cloud is located toward the Galactic anti-center. With our updated member list, we quantify this distance gradient. But it is worth noting that we can not rule out the possibility that the clusters reside in different clouds along the line of sight rather than a single cloud (Bally et al. 2008).


### Evolutionary Stages in Different Cloud Regions

In this section, we investigate the evolutionary stages in different cloud regions. Bell et al. (2013) measured an age of ∼ 6 Myr for IC 348, whereas an age of < 1 Myr was measured for NGC 1333 (Wilking et al. 2004). Young et al. (2015) obtained similar conclusion based on the fractions of YSOs at different evolutionary stages. Dividing the Perseus molecular cloud into 3 regions, IC 348, NGC 1333 clusters and the remaining cloud regions (Rebull et al. 2007), we construct the dereddened and distance corrected r − i versus r colormagnitude diagrams for each region (Figure 11). For the cluster regions, we use the median distance for each cluster to do the distance correction, and individual distances are used for individual YSOs in the remaining cloud regions. We fit isochrones from the PARSEC stellar model (Bressan et al. 2012) and estimate ages of 5.4, 2.9 and 5.7 Myr for IC 348, NGC 1333 and the remaining cloud regions, respectively. The age for the remaining cloud regions may be underestimated, since we select only candidates above the 10 Myr isochrone on the G − RP versus G color-magnitude diagram (Panel (c) in Figure 1).

Recently, Kounkel et al. (2022) obtained much younger ages of 2.5 Myr for both IC 348 and NGC 1333, by isochrone fitting of the Gaia photometry to the MIST isochrones (Choi et al. 2016). This discrepancy is mainly due to the difference between the PARSEC stellar model (Bressan et al. 2012) and the MIST isochrones (Choi et al. 2016). We obtain ages of 3.1 and 2.0 Myr for IC 348 and NGC 1333 respectively performing isochrone fitting to the MIST isochrones (Choi et al. 2016). We obtain much older age for IC 348 than for NGC 1333, which is consistent with a higher fraction of diskless objects in IC 348 than in NGC 1333 (Young et al. 2015;Luhman et al. 2016   age for NGC 1333 than previous studies (e.g., Wilking et al. 2004), and they attributed this discrepancy to the distance they assumed for NGC 1333. We obtain much younger age than Luhman et al. (2016), with our updated distance measurements. The remaining cloud regions are significantly older than NGC 1333 and nearly coeval with IC 348. Young et al. (2015) found that the number ratio of PMS stars to protostars in the remaining cloud regions is similar to that in NGC 1333, but significantly smaller than that in IC 348. This discrepancy can be partly explained by the fact that we estimated ages based on optical CMDs, which may bias toward members at later evolutionary stages and thus older ages.

We estimate the fraction of sources harboring disks as another proxy for evolutionary stages of different cloud regions. Luhman et al. (2016) estimated disk fractions of around 40% and 60% for IC 348 and NGC 1333 respectively, with disk fraction defined as N (II)/N (II + III). Based on the source counts reported in Young et al. (2015) (their Table 4), we estimate disk fractions of as high as 82%, 92% and 89% for IC 348, NGC 1333 and the remaining cloud regions, respectively. The discrepancy between the two is mainly due to that Young et al. (2015) used only infrared selected YSOs, whereas Luhman et al. (2016) included many optically visible members, to calculate the disk fractions.

Since many of the new members and candidates identified in this work lack enough Spitzer data to determine its presence or absence of a disk, we use the K S − W 2 versus H − K S color-color diagram (Figure 12) to determine the presence or absence of a disk. As shown in the plot, sources between the two dashed lines are reddened dwarfs. We consider objects with K S − W 2 > 0.98 × (H − K S ) + 0.22 to be those harboring disks. We estimate disk fractions of 45%, 65% and 30%−40% for IC 348, NGC 1333 and the remaining cloud regions, respectively, with our updated member list. We estimate similar disk fractions as that estimated by Luhman et al. (2016) for IC 348 and NGC 1333. Including or excluding the new members and candidates in the calculation has little impact on the disk fractions for IC 348 and NGC 1333, since we select few new members and candidates in these regions. But for the remaining cloud regions, we measure a much lower disk fraction compared to that excluding the new members and candidates in the calculation (30%−40% compared to 55%). We find that the remaining cloud region is more coeval with IC 348 than with NGC 1333. This result suggests the importance of including Gaia astrometric data in identifying YSOs at more evolved stages, with star-like spectral energy distributions.


### A Possible Scenario for Star Formation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud

Recently, Zucker et al. (2022) proposed that star formation near the Sun is driven by expansion of the Local Bubble (Cox & Reynolds 1987) with stellar traceback method. They found that nearly every well-known molecular cloud in the vicinity of the Sun lies on the surface of the Local Bubble, except the Perseus molecular cloud. They attributed this exception to the displacement of the recently discovered Per-Tau Shell (Bialy et al. 2021), containing Perseus on its far side and Taurus on its near side. The stellar traceback data provided by Zucker et al. (2022) indicate that IC 348 and NGC 1333 are moving away from the center of the Per-Tau Shell since about 6−8 Myr ago, and that IC 348 has already escaped the shell whereas NGC 1333 is passing through the surface of the shell (as illustrated in the left panel of Figure 13).

Since we double the census of members in the remaining cloud regions, we can investigate the distributed populations with respect to the feedback from the Per-Tau Shell or the Local Bubble. As these distributed populations spread over large areas, it is improper to apply the stellar traceback method to these data, considering the remaining cloud regions as a whole. We investigate motions and locations of individual members relative to the center of the Per-Tau Shell, nearly all of these distributed members have velocities pointing outward the shell with separation angles less than 90 • (as shown in the right panel of Figure 13), about 60% of them have escaped the shell (see the scatter plot in the left panel of Figure 13). These facts may point to the scenario that expansion of the Local Bubble drives the formation of the surface clouds (Zucker et al. 2022) as well as the Perseus molecular cloud, and subsequent expansion of the Per-Tau Shell blows away the Perseus molecular cloud from the Local Bubble's surface and results in elongated shape of the cloud. This elongation may partly explain the distance gradient confirmed in Section 5.3.

We have searched the literature as well as the Gaia archive for possible massive stars in the vicinity of the cloud that may be responsible for creating the Per-Tau Shell, but no massive stars were found within the region we studied. Bialy et al. (2021) estimated that 2-8 supernova may be responsible for creating such a large shell structure. Since our study is focused on the main cloud region only, detailed analysis of searching for the driving source of the shell is beyond the scope of current study.

Visualizing the five groups identified by Pavlidou et al. (2021) (see Figure 14), we find that the three groups, Electryon, Heleus and Mestor are far away from the Per-Tau Shell, the remaining 2 groups Alcaeus and Autochthe, as well as NGC 1333 and IC 348 are near the surface of the shell. Considering their ages (3-5 Myr, Pavlidou et al. (2021)) and their distances to the shell, the formation of the three off-shell groups are irrelevant to the Per-Tau Shell's expansion. Alcaeus share similar age as IC 348 and Autochthe is coeval with NGC 1333. These groups may form during the same star formation event. 


## SUMMARY

We have performed a search for new members and candidates in the Perseus molecular cloud, using spectroscopic data from the LAM-OST survey and astrometric data from the Gaia survey. The spectral types and extinction corrections are determined for the newly confirmed members. The spatial distributions of the updated member list and the age differences in different cloud regions are investigated. The main contributions are summarized as follows.


## We have performed a thorough census

for new members and candidates in the Perseus molecular cloud and identified 211 candidate members sharing common distances, motions and ages. We identify 51 candidates as new members of the cloud based on evidence of youth in-cluding the presence of emission lines or Li i λ 6707Å absorption lines in their optical spectra and their locations on the H-R diagram, which brings the total number of known members to 856. Due to the sensitivity of the LAMOST survey, we don't identify any new members later than M6.

2. The stellar aggregate named Autochthe in Pavlidou et al. (2021) is confirmed as a real coeval stellar aggregate with a dozen of confirmed members, with our revised member list. We also identify another small aggregate associated with the dark cloud Barnard 1.

3. The new members are less extincted, and reside in regions with low surface densities. Cloud members in the remaining cloud regions represent the type of distributed star formation, as well as star formation of the type that often produce one or a few stars.


## 4.

A statistically significant distance gradient of 4.84 pc deg −1 is measured from west to east. But it is worth noting that the possibility that the two clusters reside in different clouds along the line of sight rather than a single cloud still exists.

5. We estimate similar ages for IC 348 and the remaining cloud regions and NGC 1333 is much younger than the two. The disk fraction in NGC 1333 is higher than in elsewhere, consistent with its youngest age.

6. The bulk motion of the distributed populations is pointed outward of the Per-Tau Shell, and the five groups identified by Pavlidou et al. (2021) are moving away from the shell as well. These are consistent with the star formation scenario proposed by Zucker et al. (2022).

obtained distances of 321 pc and 293 pc for IC 348 and NGC 1333 respectively, based on VLBA and Gaia measurements. 33 Multiple measurements of the distance to the Perseus

(1990) proposed a distance of 200−250 pc to the Perseus 
molecular cloud according to extinction studies. Very 
long baseline interferometry studies of H 2 O masers gave 
distances of 235 pc for NGC 1333 (Hirota et al. 2008) 
and 232 pc toward L1448 (Hirota et al. 2011). A dis-
tance of 240 pc was estimated by comparing the density 
of foreground stars with the Robin et al. (2003) Galactic
