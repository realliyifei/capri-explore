## (s3) DISCUSSION
(p3.0) In the results of the present study, it is verified that only one study mentioned the evaluation of radioactivity compounds.The assessment of exposure to radionuclides emitted by smoke during a forest fire can be used as an indicator of cancer incidence, in particular lung cancer.However, it is known that the appearance of lung cancer in firefighters can originate from the combination of different variables, such as exposure to smoking and smoking habits (Abreu et al., 2017).

(p3.1) The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) provides international recommendations regarding acceptable values, applicable units and radiation measurement techniques.The techniques for assessing radiation exposure have evolved to ensure greater accuracy and assessment of exposure (International Commission on Radiation Units & Measurements, 2021).However, the measurement in real-time in a forest fire proves to have great difficulty in the application of equipment and the innovation of the process of sampling.In this way, some ways of assessing radioactivity are known through the use of autonomous large-volume samplers, portable aerosol samplers (Carvalho et al., 2014), by estimating the effective dose by inhalation using the Gaussian model (Viner et al., 2015) or through the use of other models.These authors use the Linear No-Threshold model to assess the risk to human health of a forest fire in a forest with radiological contamination.

(p3.2) The use of systems to monitor the health status of firefighters in real-time has already begun to be developed.However, these systems have not yet been applied to all activities at greatest risk to firefighters, as they are not yet developed with variables that indicate enough information to assess the health status of firefighters during the execution of the activity.In fact, the assessment of the firefighters' health status and, consequently, their occupational exposure does not always involve a large number of variables, as can be seen through the included studies, where the variables that are mostly included are related to smoke exposure, thermal stress and lung function (Jose A. Rodr√≠guez-Marroyo et al., 2012).
