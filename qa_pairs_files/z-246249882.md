## (s2) Diagnosis of leptospirosis 4.1 Polymerase chain reaction
(p2.0) Methods based on DNA amplification, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are crucial tools for the detection of Leptospira spp. during the acute phase of the disease wherein antibodies are below the detection limit of the most serological tests (Ahmed, van der Linden, & Hartskeerl, 2014;Denipitiya et al., 2016). The PCR is a fast, sensitive, and specific technique; however, it remains expensive (Courdurie et al., 2017;Waggoner & Pinsky, 2016).

(p2.1) Several types of PCR have been used in the diagnosis of leptospirosis (  (Denipitiya et al., 2016;Nhan, Teissier, Roche, & Musso, 2014;Waggoner et al., 2015;Waggoner & Pinsky, 2016), real-time PCR with high resolution melting analysis (qRT-PCR-HRM) (Esteves et al., 2018), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) (Ahmed et al., 2014), PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) (Gokmen et al., 2016), and assay loop-mediated isothermal amplification (Suwancharoen, Sittiwicheanwong, & Wiratsudakul, 2016).
