## (s2) Stage 1: Identification of the research questions
(p2.0) Based on the PICOH acronym (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, health care context) [37], our overall broad scoping review question is as follows: What is known in cancer populations (P-population) about the approaches to implementation of SMS interventions and/or programs (I-intervention) compared to usual care or other interventions such as implementation of patient education (C-comparator) on changes in outcomes (O-outcomes, may include four levels of change in patient knowledge, skills and/or behaviors, or intermediary variables, i.e., self-efficacy, health care provider knowledge/skills, care delivery processes, or system arrangements or health policy) in the context of cancer care (H-healthcare context: community-based programs, hospitals, primary care practices, ambulatory or outpatient care). The specific review questions to be addressed are:

(p2.1) 1. What core implementation components, implementation theories or frameworks, and specific implementation strategies have been used to facilitate uptake and embedding of SMS interventions and/or programs in routine cancer care (implementation intervention)? 2. What populations (cancer patients and/or family members, community or peer support services, family physician practices, health care organizations, health care professionals) have been targeted for implementation of SMS? 3. What are the core components, skills, or behaviors that have been emphasized in the SMS interventions and/or programs being implemented (SMS intervention)? 4. What are the enabling or inhibiting factors that influence uptake and embedding of SMS in routine care? 5. What implementation outcomes, such as care processes, and/or patient or provider intermediary (self-efficacy, behaviors) outcomes or survivor health outcomes (symptoms, quality of life, psychological distress, functioning) or system level outcomes were measured (health care use, costs)?
## (s14) Stage 3: Study selection Search criteria
(p14.0) Scoping studies are iterative; thus, proposed search terms may need to be refined as the extent of literature in the field becomes evident [33]. The literature search strategy will be initially developed for MEDLINE in consultation with an information specialist who has expertise in cancer reviews (RH). The MEDLINE strategy can be found in Additional file 3: Figure S1. An initial test of the search terms will be conducted in MEDLINE to refine the terms, and the search strategy will be modified for all other databases. A second information specialist at the University Health Network (Toronto, ON) has conducted a peer review of the search strategy using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist, which is common practice for scoping reviews [56,57]. Specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free text terms for self-management, self-efficacy, self-management support and related terms, i.e., "self-care" or "educat" or "activate," will be combined with terms for "cancer". These terms will be combined with implementation study terms, for example "real world," "routine clinical care," primary care, "Phase IV," "knowledge translation," "adoption," "integration," "dissemination" and "implementation" using Boolean logic operators (and, or).
## (s18) Stage 5. Collating, summarizing, and reporting the results
(p18.0) We will follow the PRISMA-Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines for the review and use a chart for recording the flow of data through the stages of the study selection process based on these guidelines [63]. Scoping studies seek to present an overview of all material reviewed to provide a narrative or descriptive I-intervention Any implementation intervention study that focused on, or incorporated strategies to support self-management and delivered as part of routine clinical service or in a community agency or organization. SMS program targeting patients and/or providers and/or changes in the delivery system in the context of cancer care. Study design: Implementation studies that include a range of methodologies: population-level randomized controlled trials or cluster trials, quasi-experimental prospective studies, retrospective controlled studies, interrupted time series, controlled before and after studies, case-control, uncontrolled before and after studies, observational studies, qualitative studies of implementation processes or strategies or factors enabling or hindering implementation.
## (s22) Discussion
(p22.0) While there are reviews of the implementation of SMS in routine care and significant efforts underway in the UK to integrate SMS in routine care, the emphasis has been on non-malignant chronic conditions [24] and we were unable to identify any scoping reviews of implementation studies of SMS in the context of cancer care. This scoping review will enable examination of the breadth of literature specific to cancer populations. We anticipate the results will be valuable for informing health care policy and knowledge end-users' decisions regarding implementation strategies that could be applied in the cancer system to facilitate uptake of SMS and will identify the research gaps that need to be addressed. We will disseminate the findings of the review to academic audiences using traditional methods of publications in journals and presentations at international conferences targeting health service and implementation science researchers and oncology clinicians. Additionally, we will capitalize on the dual roles of many of our investigators to disseminate the study results with key cancer or health care organizations such as Macmillan Cancer Support and Cancer Care Ontario, through networks
