## (s2) Traffic-based Congestion Control Protocols
(p2.0) In this subsection, we discuss various protocols which control congestion based on the regulation of traffic flows in WSNs.Furthermore, we classify these protocols based on their traffic-control strategies, i.e., hop-by-hop and end-to-end, how they detect, notify and control congestion.Furthermore, their weaknesses and strengths are also discussed.A summary of these protocols is provided in Table I.

(p2.1) PASCCC [9] Priority-based application specific congestion control clustering (PASCCC) protocol was proposed for congestion detection in cluster-based hierarchical WSNs.PASCCC uses the mobility along with heterogeneity of the sensor nodes, for congestion detection and mitigation.Whenever the reading of a captured packet exceeds a predefined threshold value, each source node activates, senses the environment, collects the data and forwards it upstream towards the base station.During congestion, time-critical packets get prioritized to make sure their timely arrival at the base station.Simulation results show that PASCCC enhance network life time, energy efficient and other QoS parameters.Despite all these advantages, PASCCC limitations are that excessive delay occurs during setup phase.This is because, the position of a node changes at regular intervals.Furthermore, the dropping of humidity packets has an adverse effect on applications where, none of the packets need to be dropped in presence and absence of congestion.
