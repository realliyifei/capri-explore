## (s23) Discussion and Future Work
(p23.0) Faithfulness: Though CoT prompting increases the reasoning interpretability, it still remains a problem whether present methods for generating CoT rationales are faithful.A faithful reasoning process implies the answer generated by model is accurately reasoned from corresponding generated rationale, which can ensure the controllability and credibility of reasoning process.The rationale which looks like plausible but unfaithful may make humans over-trust the model, resulting in implicit bias risk on realistic applications (Pruthi et al., 2020;Slack et al., 2020).
