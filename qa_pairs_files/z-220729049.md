Fields: Medicine

## (s3) Ritonavir
(p3.0) The use of ritonavir, a member of a group of the newer protease inhibitors was approved in 2000 by FDA (Chandwani and Shuter, 2008;Lv et al., 2015). In a prospective cohort study involving approximately 300 subjects, the initial therapy with ritonavir resulted in hepatotoxicity in 30% of patients (95% confidence interval 17.9-44.6%) (Nolan et al., 2005;Sulkowski et al., 2000). Hepatotoxicity was assessed by monitoring the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The odds ratio for hepatotoxicity following ritonavir administration in full dose i.e. 400 mg was 6.2 (95% confidence interval 2.8-13.7) (Sulkowski et al., 2000). Hepatotoxicity manifested through non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms (upper and lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), as well as jaundice and hepatomegaly. Shortly after the introduction of the protease inhibitor drug to the therapy, several cases of frequent and severe bleeding were observed in patients with hemophilia. The mechanisms responsible for bleeding have not yet been clarified. The characteristic places where the bleeding occurred were the small joints of the hands as well as the soft tissue of the palms (Nolan et al., 2005).
## (s4) Lopinavir
(p4.0) Lopinavir is antiretroviral of the protease inhibitor class, used in combination with other antiviral drugs for HIV-1 infection treatment, and recognized as potential medicine for COVID-19 disease (Gautret et al., 2020). In the study performed on 120 HIV-positive patients, the low incidence of severe liver injury attributable to lopinavir blood levels was observed (Gonz� alez- Requena et al., 2004). Similar results were obtained in another study where the incidence of hepatotoxicity after the administration of 200 mg/day of lopinavir was also low, which can be explained by low blood levels and fast metabolism of lopinavir by cytochrome P450 3A4 (Núñez, 2006). Toxic blood lopinavir levels were reported after simultaneous administration of herb medicines that may inhibit P450 enzymes. In this case, only gastrointestinal adverse effects were manifested (Beukel Van Den Bout-Van Den et al., 2008). Lopinavir is most used as the coformulation with ritonavir to maintain therapeutic drug concentration, making it the second line of antiretroviral therapy. Hence, there are limited cases of adverse or toxic effects of single lopinavir treatment. Safety data of the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir is presented in part 4.1.

(p4.1) Lopinavir is antiretroviral of the protease inhibitor class, used in combination with other antiviral drugs for HIV-1 infection treatment, and recognized as potential medicine for COVID-19 disease (Gautret et al., 2020).

## (s5) Remdesivir
(p5.0) Remdesivir is broad-spectrum antiviral prodrug that acts as adenosine nucleotide analogue, used for RNA virus infections treatment . A recent study by Grein et al. (2020) revealed that the elevation of hepatic enzymes, hypotension, renal impairment, rash and diarrhea were the most common adverse effects associated with remdesivir administration in COVID-19 patients (200 mg iv on the first day, plus 100 mg for the remaining nine days). The occurrence of adverse effects was reported in 60% of subjects. Serious adverse effects, such as acute kidney injury, hypotension, septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome were reported in 12% of subjects. Four patients discontinued the treatment because of multiple organ failure, elevated hepatic enzymes and maculopapular rash (Grein et al., 2020). Another study on Ebola patients reported AST and ALT elevation as well, in patients who received intravenous remdesivir. The same study also reported a single case of hypotension, which was followed by the discontinuation of the treatment and cardiac arrest, however, the exact cause of death could not be differentiated from the existing Ebola virus disease (Mulangu et al., 2019). The patients in this study received a loading dose on the first day (200 mg in adults, adjusted for body weight in pediatric patients), followed by 100 mg in adults on the next day for the remaining nine or thirteen days, depending on the viral load.
## (s12) Chloroquine þ azithromycin
(p12.0) There are limited data concerning the efficacy and safety of the combination of chloroquine and azithromycin in COVID-19 therapy. In a study conducted in France, combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin therapy was far more successful compared to untreated patients or treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone. Hydroxychloroquine was chosen, rather than chloroquine, because of its lower toxicity, higher safety and higher dose capability . The results obtained in this study suggest a synergistic effect of the two drugs. The researchers report that only 6 of 20 treated patients received azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine to prevent bacterial superinfection with daily monitoring of cardiac output by electrocardiogram due to the potential, but low, risk of a prolonged QT interval. The results of the above study regarding the safety of administered medicines have not yet been published (Gautret et al., 2020). These results refer to the application of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate orally, three times a day for ten days, while 500 mg of azithromycin was administered on the first day, followed by 250 mg for the next four days, with constant ECG monitoring. In an animal study based on a model of cardiac instability in guinea pigs, azithromycin alone or in combination with chloroquine did not produce a proarrhythmogenic effect, unlike the administration of chloroquine alone (Fossa et al., 2007).

(p12.1) Chloroquine þ azithromycin combination of drugs has been used earlier. In a clinical trial conducted in Africa, the combination proved to be safe in malaria therapy, where only one patient had a serious side effect of vomiting. Most other side effects were mild or very mild (Sagara et al., 2014).

(p12.2) There are limited data concerning the efficacy and safety of the combination of chloroquine and azithromycin in COVID-19 therapy.

Most other side effects were mild or very mild (Sagara et al., 2014).
