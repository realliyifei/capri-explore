## (s5) Regional blocks
(p5.0)  Femoral block In the elderly with a femoral bone fracture, using a block of nerve branches for analgesia can significantly reduce the need for opioid use (100,101).This analgesic technique, especially under ultrasound guidance, is easily carried out and lower compilations are associated (102).In addition, this method of analgesia in combat and disaster settings can be very suitable because it requires the use of a low dose of medication (103)(104)(105).

(p5.1)  Hematoma block Distal radial fracture is the most common upper limb fracture in children and adults (106).Feeling a lot of pain during manual reduction, as well as a lot of stress and discomfort by the patient, can reduce the success of the intervention (107).Drug strategies to reduce pain during reduction include the use of short-acting benzodiazepines or propofol with or without opioids (108,109).However, all of these medicines have their own side effects and limitations.Studies have shown that direct injection of analgesia into the fracture site, known as hematoma block, can be considered to be a more rapid and relatively less complicated method (110).The results of controlled trials in recent years have shown that hematoma blocks can have a strong effect on manual reduction of distal radial fractures and they involve fewer risks in comparison with systemic analgesics, a higher cost-effectiveness, and reductions in the time spent to achieve analgesia for interventions (107,(111)(112)(113).

## (s6) DISCUSSION
(p6.0) Non-opioids analgesics such as NSAIDS and acetaminophen are commonly used in the treatment of acute pain.However, the relief of acute moderate to severe pain usually requires opioid agents (151).The four primary parenteral opioids that are used in the treatment of acute pain in the ED are morphine, meperidine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone (32).Morphine and meperidine are the most common parenteral opioids used in the ED (152).Due to the short duration of action, fentanyl is primarily used for procedural sedation; hydromorphone is still not used extensively in the ED (32,152).NSAIDs are the other commonly used drugs, and although they are less effective during the first 10 minutes, they have an equal effect to opioids within 20-30 minutes and are well tolerated for shortterm use (58,(153)(154)(155).Heldigit showed that pain control using NSAIDs is better than for morphine, and the need for rescue treatment and complications in NSAIDs is lower (156,157).The anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs are due to inhibition of prostaglandins, which reduce the dilatation of the vessels, increase their permeability, increase diuretic effects on the kidneys, and increase pelvic pressure and the urine collection system (158).They also reduce swelling and inflammation and contractions of the ureter muscles.The gastrointestinal and renal side effects of NSAIDs have limited their use.However, their injectable generation such as ketorolac has minimized this complication (16).Because of the side effects of systemic drugs and the restrictions on the use of analgesics, especially opioids, regional blocks of pain as part of a multimodal analgesic strategy, especially for fractures, joint reductions, complex lacerations, chest tube placement, and even paraphimosis reduction can be helpful (159)(160)(161)(162)(163)(164)(165)(166)(167)(168)(169)(170).With an increasing population and people's awareness and advancement of medical knowledge, selecting and proper use of pain killer medications are important.This is a great challenge for healthcare professionals because many patients in pain have complex conditions with multiple comorbidities and causes of pain.
