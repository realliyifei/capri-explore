## (s5) Neosporosis
(p5.0) Neosporosis is primarily a disease of cattle and dogs. Abortions caused by Neospora caninum have been reported in alpaca and llama [150]. However, despite the numerous reports on the presence of anti-N. caninum antibodies in camel sera, clinical disease has not been documented in OWCs. Antibodies against N. caninum have been reported from camels in Mashhad (5.83%) [137] and Isfahan (3.22%) [58] using an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and also in camels in Yazd (3.94%) using a Neospora agglutination test [51].
