## (s2) Magnetic nanoparticles for fluoride removal
(p2.0) Magnetic nanoparticles have large surface area; high reactivity, specificity, and self-assembly make them different from common adsorbents. A number of magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized for fluoride removal. Markeb et al., 13 synthesized Ce-Ti@Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles for fluoride removal. They found the maximum adsorption capacity of 91.04 mg/g at pH 7 and also showed a fast adsorption rate. They also observed that it can be used for 5 cycles without significant loss of adsorption capacity. Similarly, Zhao et al., 14 synthesized Fe 3 O 4 @Al (OH) 3 nanoparticles which combines the advantages of magnetic separation and aluminum oxide has a high affinity towards fluoride.
