## (s9) Water Absorption Test
(p9.0) All the polymers sorb water in a humid atmosphere and when immersed in water.The amount of water adsorbed by non-polar polymers containing filler depends mainly on the nature of the fillers.Natural fillers have an undesirable property, namely, hygroscopicity because of their hydrophilic nature.The moisture adsorption by composites containing natural fillers has several adverse effects on their properties, thus affecting their longterm performance.In many of the applications of the PP and its composites, the material is exposed to water and atmospheric moisture for long periods.This can lead to loss of adhesive strength due to weakening of the product at the interface.This damage results from the diffusion of water molecules throughout the polymer chains causing plasticization, chain rupture, and chemical degradation.The knowledge of water and water vapor sorption in composites and in polymer matrices is considered to be of utmost importance (Prachayawarakorn, 2005).Therefore, it is important to study in detail the water adsorption behavior in order to evaluate not only the consequences that the water absorption may have, but also how this water uptake can be minimized in some way.
