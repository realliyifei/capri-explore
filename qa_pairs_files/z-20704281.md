## (s1) Disc Degeneration
(p1.0) The IVD is an avascular structure that depends on diffusion of oxygen and nutrients from the VB endplates, a process that is impaired progressively with age and also with cigarette smoking. 12Disc degeneration occurs gradually and is extremely common in asymptomatic adults; 98% of healthy adults in their 20s show early changes. 61,75Therefore, it is imperative to always interpret MRI findings in the context of clinical symptoms and signs.In DCM, the following are 3 key characteristics that indicate the severity of disc degeneration: 1) loss of T2WI hyperintensity of the nucleus pulposus and resulting loss of delineation between the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus on T2WI, 2) narrowing of the IVD space, and 3) migration of disc material into the spinal canal.Both qualitative and quantitative methods for assessing these pathological features, with the purpose of classifying the degree of severity, have been described (Table 2).
## (s4) sagittal Alignment
(p4.0) It is becoming increasingly recognized that sagittal alignment might be a contributor to disease severity in patients with DCM and is certainly an important factor in the selection of an anterior or posterior surgical approach. 4,68herefore, assessment of the cervical spine should include evaluation for scoliosis, hyperlordosis, and kyphosis.Sagittal balance and alignment can be assessed optimally by using standing radiographs of the whole spine, but some measurements, made by using cervical MRI, have been reported, and they might prove useful in the absence of upright films.

(p4.1) For assessing cervical kyphosis, Ruangchainikom et al. 92 used a previously described but modified method for radiographs, 80 which classified cervical kyphosis as 1 of 3 forms: C type (global), S type (sigmoid), and R type (re-  verse sigmoid).In addition to the assessment of kyphosis, the radiographic method also included criteria for evaluating hyperlordosis, which presumably would also be feasible for adoption with MRI.It has been shown also that MRI has utility similar to that of radiographs for the assessment of thoracolumbar kyphosis and scoliosis using Cobb angle measurement. 15,96,106,126However, the reliability and validity of MRI-based Cobb angle measurements for evaluating the cervical region have yet to be established.

(p4.2) Another measurement technique that can be used to assess cervical curvature was described by Batzdorf and Batzdorff 13 for radiographs and later used on MRI by Chen et al. 19 For this measurement, a line is drawn from the posteroinferior aspect of the C-2 VB to the posteroinferior aspect of the C-7 VB, and no portion of the C3-6 VB should cross the drawn line. 13,19Ames et al. 4 also described several additional measures of cervical sagittal alignment based on radiographs, including the chin brow vertical level, the T-1 slope, the sagittal vertical axis, the Harrison posterior tangent method, and Jackson physiological stress lines, 4 but the validity of these measurements using MRI has yet to be reported in the literature.Overall, the supine positioning of patients for conventional MRI limits its utility in assessing alignment, but at least it can provide a superficial assessment of alignment for scenarios in which upright films are unavailable.

(p4.3) With the emergence of flexion/extension and upright MRI technology, new methods of assessing cervical alignment might appear in the near future; however, given the low cost, easy access, and proven utility of radiographs, the role of more sophisticated MRI-based techniques in assessing alignment and stability is unclear.
## (s13) DCM and Contrast-enhanced Mri
(p13.0) Contrast enhancement with Gd can reveal areas of blood-spinal cord barrier disruption.It is not typical for patients with DCM to be evaluated using contrast-enhanced MRI, but it might serve to exclude other causes of myelopathy in cases of diagnostic uncertainty.The differential diagnosis includes vascular, inflammatory, infective, neoplastic, and demyelinating diseases. 16It was suggested recently that a pancake-like Gd enhancement of the spinal cord on sagittal images immediately below the area of compression and circumferential enhancement on axial images in patients with intramedullary lesions found with T2WI are strongly indicative of DCM. 27Another study found a 7.3% prevalence of intramedullary Gd enhancement in 683 cases of cervical myelopathy and suggested that enhancement was seen most commonly approximating the site of compression. 85Furthermore, this study also found that there was a statistically significant inferior recovery potential in patients whose imaging showed enhancement.The presence of enhancement in only some cases of DCM diminishes the diagnostic utility of this technique, and it is unlikely to provide additional information beyond that obtained from T1WI and T2WI for the vast majority of patients.Furthermore, Gd testing has a number of disadvantages; it is invasive, it can cause a hypersensitivity reaction, it requires an assessment of kidney function, and it is very expensive.Therefore, further research is required to demonstrate its clear diagnostic utility.
