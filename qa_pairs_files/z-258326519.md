## (s3) Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
(p3.0) Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, autoimmune cholestatic disease causing fibro-inflammatory destruction of the intra-and/or extrahepatic bile ducts, often complicated by inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis [26]; although the disease course may be variable, in most cases it ultimately leads to biliary cirrhosis and liver dysfunction. In Europe and North America, the incidence rate of PSC ranges from 0.5 to 1.3 per 100,000 person-years, whereas in Asian countries this disease is less common [27]. In Western countries, PSC represents the most important risk factor for CCA, and patients with PSC carry a 400-fold higher risk of developing this malignancy compared to the general population [28]. The occurrence of CCA in these patients is higher in the first 2 years after PSC diagnosis, with 30-50% of CCAs developing within the first year [28].
## (s4) Hepatitis Virus Infection
(p4.0) Hepatitis viruses are well-known risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and worldwide approximately 56% and 20% of HCC cases are related to HBV and HCV infections, respectively [35]. Recent studies suggest that both HBV and HCV may also represent risk factors for CCA, particularly iCCA [36]. It seems that differences in HBV-and HCV-related CCA risk exist between Asian and Western populations. Indeed, while HBV infection represents a risk factor for CCA in some Asian countries such as China, where it is highly endemic, HCV-related CCAs mostly occur in Western countries and the United States [36]. The molecular mechanisms of HBV-and HCV-related CCA carcinogenesis still remain poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized that they may be similar to those driving HCC carcinogenesis, including a status of chronic inflammation due to the continuous presence of the virus in target tissues, and insertional mutagenesis in host cells of viral DNA, which can directly promote malignant transformation [37]. In HCC carcinogenesis, HBV-DNA insertion is an early event after viral infection and results in DNA damage and genomic instability in infected cells; furthermore, the integration sites of HBV-DNA are not random, but target specific loci of the tumor genome [38].

(p4.1) Recently, the presence of HBV-DNA has been also detected in iCCA tumor samples. As for HCC, recent studies suggest that HBV integration is not a random event, but preferentially occurs in the promoter region of target genes [38]. A molecular analysis of 41 HBV-associated iCCAs identified most recurrent HBV integration events in TERT (10%), ZMAT4 (5%), MET (5%), ANKFN1 (5%), and PLXNB2 (5%) genes [39]. Another molecular analysis of a largest population study of 108 HBV-associated iCCAs reported the occurrence of HBV insertion in 41.7% of cases, with recurrent integration sites in TERT, FN1, FAT2, BRD9, ABCA12 and NBPF20 genes [40]. Notably, HBV genome integrations in the TERT gene were found in 7% of HBV-associated iCCAs and clustered in 87.5% of cases in the promoter region of this gene [40], which represents one of the most frequent sites of HBV insertion also in HCC [41]. Furthermore, hot-spot mutations in the TERT promoter were detected in 11 (10%) of HBV-associated iCCAs and were mutually exclusive with HBV insertional events [40]. Interestingly, molecular comparison of HBV-associated iCCAs with 167 HBV-associated HCCs, 154 non-viral/fluke-negative iCCAs and 16 non-viral/flukepositive iCCAs revealed that the overall mutational profile of HBV-associated iCCAs was closer (except for the occurrence of the RB1 mutation also detected in HBV-associated HCCs) to that of non-viral/fluke-negative iCCAs, showing recurrent mutation rates in the IDH1, PBRM1 and PIK3CA gene; however, differently to non-viral/fluke-negative iCCAs, which show recurrent FGFR2 genetic aberrations, FGFR2 fusions were detected only in 0.9% of HBV-iCCAs [40]. Furthermore, when HBV-associated iCCAs were stratified according to the presence or absence of HBV-DNA insertion in the tumor genome, a higher frequency of TP53 mutations was found in the subgroup of iCCAs positive for viral integration [40].

(p4.2) A positive association between the occurrence of TP53 mutations and HBsAg positivity has been also reported in a previous study on 102 iCCA Chinese patients; in the same study, a high frequency of KRAS mutations was detected in patients negative for HBsAg [42]. Similarly, a molecular study on 97 liver cancers with biliary phenotype reported a higher recurrence rate of KRAS (20%) and IDH1/2 (20%) mutations in hepatitis-negative patients, compared to hepatitis-positive patients [43].

(p4.3) Overall, these molecular studies suggest that insertions of the hepatisis virus genome occur frequently in iCCAs patients and that a different mutational pattern exists between iCCAs patients positive for HBV/HCV and iCCAs patients negative for such an infection.
## (s5) Bile Duct Cysts
(p5.0) Bile duct cysts are a rare congenital disorder characterized by cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary tree, usually diagnosed during childhood or in young adults. According to Todani's classification, they can be anatomically classified into type I-V, with type I and IV accounting for about 50-80% and 15-35% of all cases, respectively [44]. The incidence of bile duct cysts is high in Asian countries, especially China and Japan (up to 100 per 100,000 person-years), while is relatively low in Western populations (1:100,000 per 100,000 person-years) [45]. The increase in CCA risk in patients with bile duct cysts is well established (up to 30-fold, compared to the general population), especially in those carrying type I and IV cysts, remaining significant even after cyst excision [46,47]. The molecular mechanisms leading to CCA development in patients with bile duct cysts still need to be fully clarified. It has been hypothesized that reflux of pancreatic enzymes, bile stasis and increased intraductal concentration of bile acids may play a central role in biliary tract carcinogenesis [48]. Indeed, the continuous stimulus of biliary epithelial cells by activated pancreatic enzymes, increased secondary bile acids and other mutagens results in chronic inflammation and increased cell proliferation, which in turn lead to oncogene and/or tumor suppressor gene mutations and cell malignant transformation [48].

(p5.1) Currently, the mutational pattern of CCA associated with bile duct cysts has not been investigated in large population studies. Recently, the case of a 16-year-old girl who developed an eCCA after two years from choledochal cyst resection has been reported [49]. Tumor sequencing showed the occurrence of de novo somatic mutations in TP53 and RBM10 genes, along with KRAS amplification; however, these genetic alterations were likely sporadic in this patient, as they occurred shortly after cyst resection [49].

(p5.2) Bile duct cysts are frequently associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction, a congenital malformation where pancreatic and bile ducts join anatomically outside the duodenal wall [50]. Pancreaticobiliary maljunction is widely recognized as an important risk factor for biliary tract cancer [51]. Biliary tract carcinogenesis associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction is characterized by a hyperplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence induced by the status of chronic inflammation in the biliary epithelium [51]. A molecular study on cancerous and noncancerous biliary tract epithelium from 37 patients with pancreaticobiliary maljunction reported a high incidence rate of KRAS and TP53 mutations both in cancerous and noncancerous lesions, suggesting that in this patient setting the occurrence of these mutations may represent an early event in biliary carcinogenesis [52]. Despite these findings, no definitive conclusion can be drawn about the genetic profile of CCA associated with bile duct cysts, and further molecular studies on a larger patient population are needed.
## (s6) Liver Cirrhosis
(p6.0) Cirrhosis represents the final stage of liver fibrosis and is characterized by profound changes in the hepatic architecture, with the formation of fibrous septae and regenerative nodules in response to chronic liver injury, which progressively leads to liver disfunction. Cirrhosis represent the main risk factor for HCC, but epidemiological studies have proven evidence that it also represents a risk factor for CCA, especially iCCA [53]. A recent largescale retrospective study on 1312 iCCA Asian patients reported that 23.0% of iCCA cases occurred on a cirrhotic liver, a much higher percentage than in Western countries [54]; furthermore, 90.1% of cirrhotic patients showed HBsAg positivity, indicating that liver cirrhosis is mostly associated with HBV infection in China [54].

(p6.1) The molecular mechanisms underlying iCCA carcinogenesis in cirrhotic patients are not well understood, but are thought to be similar to those driving HCC development. Regenerative nodules encountered in liver cirrhosis are sustained by ductular reaction, which is characterized by the appearance of reactive ductules comprising hepatic progenitor cells and transit-amplifying cells committed towards hepatocyte and/or cholangiocyte lineages [55].
## (s10) Organic Solvents
(p10.0) To date, the role of environmental risk factors in CCA development has been little investigated. An increased iCCA incidence has been reported among workers of a printing company in Osaka, following chronic exposure to high concentrations of volatile organic solvents, mainly 1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-DCP) and dichloromethane (DCM) [69]. Among the 111 workers, 17 developed an iCCA at a younger age than the general population (from 25 to 45 years old), and none of them resulted in being exposed to other known risk factors for this disease [69]. Notably, it was observed that iCCA incidence increased with cumulative exposure to 1,2-DCP (adjusted RR = 14.9, 95% CI 4.1-54.3 for middle-exposure category, and adjusted RR = 17.1, 95% CI 3.8-76.2 for high-exposure category), suggesting an exposure-response relationship [70]. The potential association between CCA development and 1,2-DCP and/or DCM exposure has been reinforced by further epidemiological studies reporting the occurrence of this malignancy in an additional 13 printing workers of other Japanese companies [71,72] and in 6 out of 11 Thai workers occupationally exposed to these substances [73].
