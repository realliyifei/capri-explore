## (s24) Imaging
(p24.0) ASPC is a hyper-vascular tumor. On CT scan with contrast enhancement, it appears as a large well defined predominantly solid and lobulated mass with ring enhancement in the peripheral area and central necrosis. Patients with vessel invasion have a poor prognosis [116] . Usually ASPC presents as a large mass in the pancreatic tail; small adenosquamous lesions appear to be more frequently in the head of pancreas. Venous tumor thrombus was seen only in large masses [117] .
