## (s1) Overviews of literature reviews about augmented reality an virtual reality in tourism
(p1.0) Immersive technologies, both AR and VR, have revolutionized the tourism industry, offering unprecedented opportunities for immersive experiences and transforming the way travelers engage with tourism attractions (Buhalis et al., 2019).However, as noted before, despite the growing academic interest and adoption of AR and VR in tourism, the literature is fragmented, and there is a noticeable lack of comprehensive literature reviews that consolidate the existing body of research.With the aim of providing an overview of the existing literature reviews on AR and VR in the tourism field, this section presents the current exceptions based on their Tourism experience temporal evolution, analyzing their contributions to the understanding and application of AR and VR in the tourism industry.Beck et al. (2019), considering solely the impact of VR in tourism, conducts a state-of-theart review analysis to contribute to understand VR research in tourism.These authors consider that previous research has not specified the VR system, generating confusion and misunderstanding as the term VR includes systems with different technical capabilities.Based on their levels of immersion, they distinguish between non-(e.g.desktop-based VR), semi-(e.g.multiple projection screens that project content on walls and floor) and fully immersive (complete isolation of the user with the world; e.g.head-mounted displays) VR systems in tourism.The authors explain the different papers on VR research in tourism considering the former taxonomy in an attempt to correctly delineate the terms and associated research.The development of VR devices goes hand in hand with research development: while research before 2013 was mainly based on non-immersive VR, most recent research is focused on full immersive VR.

(p1.1) Yung and Khoo-Lattimore (2017) indicate that there was not known systematic knowledge that emerges from the academic papers on VR and AR in tourism.To that aim, they conducted a systematic quantitative review with 46 papers whose results display that the most selected types of VR/AR are "virtual worlds" and "virtual environments."Among the tourism context in which VR/AR research has emerged, it can be highlighted marketing, education and conceptual.Categories as food and beverage or MICE remains unexplored.As for the methodologies, conceptual papers and quantitative surveys are clearly the most commonly used.The authors claim for the need of more theory-based research on VR/AR in tourism.Among the exceptions, technology acceptance model (TAM), theory of planned behavior and flow theory are the most applied ones.Based on their review, they propose a model of challenges to VR adoption for tourism.

(p1.2) Wei (2019) considers both AR and VR research in hospitality and tourism.She conducted a literature review of 60 papers published between 2000 and.The findings show that there is a growing trend in the publication of papers in this topic.Most of VR/AR research has been conducted in Europe or Asia, covering contexts such as tourism destinations or cultural heritage sites as museums (lack of research in hotels and restaurants).Based on the reviewed literature, the author proposes a unifying framework of VR/AR user experiences consisting of stimuli (service environment, individual differences, interpersonal factors and presence), dimensions of the VR/AR experience (instrumental, experiential, psychological and social) and consequences (e.g.emotional response, satisfaction, destination image, behavioral intentions).The most used theories are grouped into antecedents-related to VR/ AR user experience (e.g.TAM) or process-related theoretical models (e.g.process theory).As for quantitative methodologies, surveys are the most used; while for qualitative methodologies, focus groups and interviews are the most common.Experimental research is beginning to be carried out.Two suggestions for future research are proposed: the need for cross-cultural approach in the studies and more research in events and hospitality settings.

(p1.3) Jingen Liang and Elliot (2020) focus solely on AR application to tourism.They conducted a literature search, which resulted in 32 selected articles.They showed the evolution of AR tourism research, starting with AR design and development toward more novel topics such as gamification, user experience, satisfaction and behavioral intentions.A conceptual map including the constructs of the reviewed articles is presented.Both qualitative (e.g.focus groups) and quantitative (e.g.field survey) methodologies were used.Based on these results, they propose several future research directions (e.g.gamification, actual behaviors, negative consequences of AR, mixed methods).SJME Loureiro et al. (2020), by using citation network analysis and text-mining techniques, conduct a literature review of 56 articles about VR and AR in tourism.The longitudinal analysis highlights the recent wave (from 2014) of published papers in the selected topic, being this trend more pronounced in recent years.They also show the topics covered by the selected literature: smart cities and cultural heritage, mobile uses for sustainable tourism, tourism destination marketing, experiential and telepresence, AR, among others.Based on the results, Loureiro et al. (2020) propose several research questions and four key realms for the future evolution of research on AR and VR in tourism: multisensory experiences, braincomputer interactions, well-being development and use of artificial intelligence in immersive settings.

(p1.4) The most recent literature review is authored by Fan et al. (2022b), who conducted the first meta-analysis on AR and VR research in tourism based on 56 papers (65 studies).The authors identify presence as a key construct which affects both value perceptions (e.g.ease of use, enjoyment) and psychological responses (e.g.flow, affective engagement), resulting in consequences (e.g.behavioral intentions/actual behaviors, attachment).Moderating variables (e.g.experience type) are also included in this proposal.The results of the metaanalysis show that most of the hypotheses are supported.Particularly, presence has direct (and indirect) effects on the mediating variables, which affect the responses.Simulation type and social interaction positively moderate (while prior visitation negatively moderate) the relationship of presence and tourism experience.They also propose opportunities for future research: the application of VR/AR to the different stages of the tourism journey (pre-tour, during, post-tour), possible negative effects of immersive technologies, the use of other methods (e.g.sentiment analysis), immersive technologies and sustainability or social interaction.
## (s4) Number of papers and journals
(p4.0) Early studies analyzing the impact of AR and VR on tourism began in the 1990s (Cheong, 1995;Williams and Hobson, 1995) (see Figure 1).Theoretical developments discussed the idea of VR as a potential substitute or competitor of real tourism (Hobson and Williams, 1995), while others deem that VR will never replace the feeling of an actual trip (Dewailly, 1999).Despite these theoretical advances, literature on this research topic is scarce in the first decade of the 21st century (Loureiro et al., 2020).Nevertheless, the theoretical work of Guttentag ( 2010) is the cornerstone for most of the subsequent research conducted in the field.Guttentag (2010) explores the sensory developments and the applications of VR in the tourism industry.He also discusses the idea of VR as a potential substitute of physical tourism, noting that VR can increase the potential tourists' desire of visiting the real tourist attractions.

(p4.1) According to several systematic literature reviews recently conducted, the largest body of research has been published in the past decade, being this trend more pronounced in the past five years (Loureiro et al., 2020;Wei, 2019).Our review shows a similar pattern, with most of the research being published since 2015.When comparing between AR and VR (see Figure 2), the research in 2010-2015 has mainly focused on AR (19 articles; e.g.Chung et al., 2015;Jung et al., 2015).For instance, Jung et al. (2015) conducted a field study in which visitors of a tourist attraction used an AR app.Their findings show that some properties of the AR app (content and service quality, personalized service) lead to higher satisfaction and intention to recommend the AR experience.However, recent studies are also focusing on VR (Wei et al., 2023;Aldossary and McLean, 2022), being the most addressed research topic in recent years (55 articles selected).In this way, Wei et al. (2023) show that gamification can alleviate fatigue and improve satisfaction levels in a VR tourism experience.The results show that VR articles have mainly focused on destinations (22) and general tourism (19).Some studies analyze the tourist experience by measuring the effect of presence (Tussyadiah et al., 2018a(Tussyadiah et al., , 2018b)), VR pre-experience (Griffin et al., 2017, Orús et al., 2021) or even visitor interactions during a VR experience (Hudson et al., 2019;Lee et al., 2020).In addition, there are studies that focus on certain tourism, such as Wen and Leung (2021) who explore the experiences of young consumers in the purchase of wine and their subsequent  2022), which examines pro-environmental behaviors in terms of tourism.There are also recent articles that consider the context of hotels to explore the role of mental imagery (Bogicevic et al., 2019), telepresence (Israel et al., 2019a(Israel et al., , 2019b) ) or the use of VR to mitigate daily negative mode spillover among hotel frontline employees (Leung et al., 2023).
## (s5) Stage
(p5.0) This section analyzes the stage of the customer journey in which the research is developed (pre-experience, on-site experience or post-experience; Lemon and Verhoef, 2016).Figure 4 shows the evolution of the selected articles over time according to the stage and the used technology (AR, VR, AR and VR).
## (s9) Tourism experience
(p9.0) Regarding AR variables, we highlight device variables, where we find effort expectancy, one of the most used (Ronaghi and Ronaghi, 2022;Calderón-Fajardo et al., 2023).Regarding content, personalized service with the AR app has only been studied in the context of AR (Jung et al., 2015).It refers to the ability to provide personalized information, understand the users' needs and preferences, as well as personalized interaction (Jung et al., 2015).In addition, in the context of AR in tourism, it has also been addressed variables related to users' personal perceptions: critical mass (Hsiao and Tang, 2021), ease of imagination (Orús et al., 2021), innovation resistance and social influence (Ronaghi and Ronaghi, 2022) or social interaction (Hudson et al., 2019;Kim et al., 2020aKim et al., , 2020b)).Finally, this study identifies the consequences derived from the use of AR in tourism: such as continuing use intention (Chung et al., 2018), emotional arousal and feeling of belonging (Hu et al., 2021), as well as the willingness to pay more to use this technology in their tourism experiences (He et al., 2018).
