## (s4) Source of waste in Deli Serdang Regency
(p4.0) MSW is typically generated from a range of sources where various human activities occur.According to various studies, households generate most of the MSW in developing countries (55-80%), followed by market or commercial sectors (10-30%).[11].composed of varied amounts created by industry, roadways, institutions, and several other elements.Data on waste sources can help define the goal of MSWM.Based on SIPSN data 2021, Figure 3 shows the proportion of waste sources in Deli Serdang Regency and Medan city.The sources of waste varied slightly between the regency area and the city area.Households are the largest waste generators in Deli Serdang regency and Medan city at 43%, and differences can be seen from other sources, such as the market.Traditional markets in regency areas generate more waste than those in city areas because traditional markets are frequented in city areas, and residents in city areas prefer to visit supermarkets and contemporary marketplaces.A similar effect is found for offices in cities that create a higher proportion of solid waste than offices in regencies.Due to the number and complexity of operations in city commercial areas, city commercial areas create a greater percentage of MSW than regency commercial areas.
