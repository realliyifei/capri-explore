## (s9) Shades of Truth
(p9.0) The notion of shades of truth is important in mis-and disinformation detection. For example, fact-checking often goes beyond binary true/false labels, e.g., Nakov et al. (2018) used a third category half-true, Rashkin et al. (2017) included mixed and no factual evidence, and Wang (2017); Santia and Williams (2018) adopted an even finer-grained schema with six labels, including barely true and utterly false. We believe that such shades could be applied to stance and used in a larger pipeline. In fact, fine-grained labels are common for the related task of Sentiment Analysis (Pang and Lee, 2005;Rosenthal et al., 2017).
