## (s5) Gestation and Chestfeeding in Trans* Men
(p5.0) Some of the individuals who need obstetric care are not ciswomen [8]. In those trans* men who have undergone surgeries during their transition, such as hysterectomy, metaoidioplasty, or phalloplasty, pregnancy is not a possibility [21].
## (s7) Barriers in Healthcare
(p7.0) Although the equity of the trans* community has been gaining strength worldwide, there is still a lack of education and necessary support regarding the lactation process. This fact might be related to the lack of experiences and knowledge of this event in the trans* population [47]. Recent studies have indicated the lack of works addressing this topic in the field of nursing compared to other health professions. There is a minimum number of scientific studies related to the role of nurses in care provided to trans* individuals, especially during perinatal care [17].
