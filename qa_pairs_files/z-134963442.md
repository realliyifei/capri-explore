## (s4) CONCLUSIONS
(p4.0) Design as a professional activity linked to the market, and therefore to the symbolic exchange of goods and services, must ask itself what is the internal goal it seeks to guarantee the survival of the human being [22], that is to say, if it continues in the line of an unsustainable development based on excessive economic growth (maintained at the expense of the exploitation of natural and human systems) or on the contrary begins to walk alongside an economy based on solidarity, sustainability, participative and humanist practices, which seek the satisfaction of needs and the integral development of the human being and the community over the maximization of economic benefit.

(p4.1) In view of the above, we can conclude that the integration of sustainability in design inevitably entails the questioning of the current economic system, due to its inability to harmonise with nature and to incorporate the human factor into its activities. If we also understand sustainability from a strong, multisystemic point of view, it is impossible not to consider the need for a change in the consumption and production habits of the most developed countries. In these societies, the acquisition of goods and services is carried out as a cultural guideline and, therefore, the products become systems of signs that transmit information, values, ideas and emotions. Consequently, the material and symbolic world we are building can contribute to nurturing the cultural wheel of consumerism.
