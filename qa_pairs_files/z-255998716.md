## (s8) Preservation of Han's property by Extensions
(p8.0) Recently, some authors gave contributions for the understanding of Han's conjecture in a distinct way from above. Having in mind, for example, a possible inductive step in order to prove the conjecture, many efforts were given in the following direction: encountering extensions of algebras that preserves Han's property, i.e. pairs of algebras B ⊆ A such that, if B satisfy Han's property, then A also satisfy it. We summarize these in  Null-square algebras: In [CRS21], the authors analyse null-square algebras, which are constructed using two algebras A and B, one A-B-bimodule N and one B-A-bimodule M . They are of the form

(p8.1) where the matrix multiplications are given by the bimodule structure of M and N and the convention mn = nm = 0 for all m ∈ M, n ∈ N . In this way, the algebra above is an extension of A × B.
