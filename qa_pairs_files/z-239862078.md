## (s6) Results and Discussion
(p6.0) The bibliographical research resulted in the selection of 40 articles. Of these, 23 articles were excluded after the reviewers had read the titles and abstracts. Of the 17 articles that were selected for full reading, only 14 articles met all eligibility criteria and were included in this review (Figure 1). Drugs such as pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, clindamycin, azithromycin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole), dapsone, spiramicin, and atovaquone can be used to treat toxoplasmosis. However, none of these is satisfactory regarding effectiveness against all forms of T. gondii and safety due to the frequent occurrence of adverse events, as demonstrated in 85% of patients treated for ophthalmic toxoplasmosis (Guaraldo et al., 2018;Iaccheri et al., 2008).
