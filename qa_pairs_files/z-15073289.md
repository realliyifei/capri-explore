## (s5) Health relevance of brake wear particles
(p5.0) Several key factors (i.e. size distribution, agglomeration state, chemical composition, surface area, chemistry and charge) need to be taken into account when investigating wear particle toxicity (Oberd√∂rster et al. 2005), among which particle size and chemical composition seem to be the most important.
