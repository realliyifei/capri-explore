## (s8) 2) Challenge for Students
(p8.0) When students learn about design thinking for the first time, they will suffer from confusion and frustration, because they will try to understand and learn design thinking with the thinking of each when they are given the project to handle (Panke, 2020).Researchers suggest that students should strive to create opportunities by understanding the perspectives required for learning design thinking (Tsalapatas et al., 2019;Baniya et al., 2019).

(p8.1) Additionally, students have difficulties in learning design thinking because of the lack of creativity when students have to solve a problem using design thinking (Henriksen et al., 2017;Clark et al., 2020).They do not see the problem as an opportunity to increase their creativity to solve the (Henriksen et al., 2017).Therefore, creativity is the most important foundation for design thinking in education (Linton & Klinton, 2019;Tsalapatas et al., 2019).Another challenge faced by students when learning through design thinking is that they lack good ideas to design a project as required by their teachers.This lack of good ideas will encourage students to take things for granted, and they

(p8.2) will not be eager to complete the work given by their teacher (Linton & Klinton, 2019;Panke, 2020).With the advent of good ideas, students will be more excited and more engaged in class activities (Hanghøj et al., 2019;De la Fuente et al., 2019).

(p8.3) In addition, students may face teamwork challenges in conducting design thinking projects in the classroom because of conflicts or difficulties within their teams, due to disagreements and lack of cooperation (Lynch et al., 2019;Panke, 2020).Misunderstandings in communication will also cause a breakdown in teamwork between students (Lynch et al., 2019).Teamwork is very important in design thinking because it requires a lot of different opinions to ensure that the work can be prepared properly (Krüger, 2019).The overall summary of the challenges are listed in Table 2.
