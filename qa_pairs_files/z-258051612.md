## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Afflicting >37 million people worldwide, atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the Western world (Lippi et al., 2021). AF increases the risk of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and death, including sudden cardiac death (Staerk et al., 2017). Unfortunately, existing therapies for the prevention and treatment of AF are suboptimal due to high recurrence rates and serious associated adverse events (Gupta et al., 2013;January et al., 2014). In order to develop novel AF therapies, animal models have been employed to investigate the molecular determinants of the AF substrate.
