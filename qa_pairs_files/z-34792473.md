## (s2) ANIMAL MODELS OF AHF
(p2.0) Knowledge of the pathophysiology and treatment of AHF are limited by the lack of satisfactory animal models. Many attempts have been made to develop a suitable model which can be replicated, using a wide variety of species and approaches, from surgical models to the use of hepatoxic drugs (Table 1). However, to date a simple model which accurately reproduces the pattern of human AHF has not been reported, and the models currently in use present significant limitations [49,50] .
## (s4) Chemical models
(p4.0) The use of chemical agents such as acetaminophen, thioacetamide or galactosamine may reproduce a number of important AHF clinical characteristics, such as hypoglycemia, encephalopathy, and increased blood levels of hepatic enzymes, and hepatotoxic chemical agents are still frequently used as a model for AHF. However, repeated administration or a support therapy may be required in some models. In addition, intracranial hypertension, one of the main characteristics of human AHF, is absent in some chemical models whilst in other cases, an increase in toxins involved in hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema in human AHF cannot always be demonstrated [49] .
