## (s2) Concepts of MG Energy Management and Control
(p2.0) Formation of MGs is becoming more common because of their standalone/grid-connected operation, easy integrating capability to new RES, ESS, energy-positive buildings, and ability to offer services to neighbor energy systems.Therefore, EM in MGs is an important task to be performed for efficient operation as the variability and uncertainty of renewables, storage characteristics, and loads further complicate it.This can be achieved through the different control and optimization methods that provide optimal control and cost-effective utilization of MG assets.Usually, review works mostly focused on the control and optimization methods and presented from the operational point of view of MG-EMS.There is a lack of understanding of control and optimization methodologies from the perspective of the energy trilemma (flexibility, affordability, and security).Usually, energy trilemma (as sustainability, affordability, and security) perspective studies are done for the whole energy systems, network level integration of different energy systems, their planning and operation [11], and cost-efficient expansion and planning [12,13] towards indexing economic energy goals and compare energy system performance at the country level [14].However, addressing the energy trilemma perspective in the MGs-EMS has never been presented in the literature.The flexible, affordable, and secure operation of microgrids results from an efficient EMS that is possible through advances in control and optimization approaches.

(p11.0) MPC is gaining popularity due to its adaptability, capacity to be applied in any application regardless of field, and the availability of fast computers.The work described here will assist researchers in further exploring the versatility of this controller for design, analysis, and implementation in renewable energy systems.

(p11.1) The present review work related to MG-EMS, their control, and optimization is focused on energy trilemma as flexibility, security, and affordability [11] are also the major requirements of MG structure.As MGs comprise more of active, controllable, and ICT components, the study of energy management from the perspective of energy trilemma is meaningful and achieving it at the level of MGs can be propagated to the whole energy system.Hence, a study that gives a perspective of energy trilemma in MG-EMS and their insights that are beneficial to advancements in control and optimization methodologies are needed.As of the authors' knowledge, this review is the first of its kind in presenting the MG energy management concept along with the categorization of objectives, control, and optimization methods from the energy trilemma perspective.
## (s14) Methodology of the Review
(p14.0) Microgrids are a popular research topic, and significant research development has been published addressing various aspects such as generation, storage systems, and their management (RES, DERs, batteries) to energy trading using peer-to-peer methods.Around 35,000 papers have resulted from the keyword "microgrid" in Scopus showing the level of interest in this research area among the power and energy community.Many research articles (~2000) are published related to the MG, smart energy system, and EM that are evident from the databases such as IEEE and Scopus.This study conducts a systematic literature review to examine several factors, analyzes and classifies MAS, MPCbased control, and optimization methods for MGs-EMS from the perspective of energy trilemma.To do so, a relatively large number of papers dedicated to the subject are acknowledged, introducing the taxonomy of control and optimization methods for the MG system.The focus of the paper is confined to the methods that use MAS, and MPCbased approaches for EM in MGs as there is a need for an increasing trend of independent behavior in the present dynamic energy system environment.MAS approaches suitable for such kind of systems and observed increasing interest in applying MAS technologies to the current MGs scenarios as they provide features such as active/reactive, social, scalable, and decentralized/distributed control.Moreover, due to the advancement in computational abilities, communication and privacy requirements, and lack of understanding of interactions between the control and optimization methods related to "complexity", "uncertainty", and "forecasting", MAS, MPC approaches seem to be beneficial for MGs-EMS.As RES introduces intermittency and uncertainty to the MGs, MPC-based methods provide better control as it involves the forecasting information.For this systematic review, the papers screened through the keywords "microgrid", "energy management", "control and optimization", "MAS", and "MPC" along with decentralized, distributed, and hierarchical control architectures.Figure 3 shows the number of publications that use the MAS and MPC-based methods for MG control.It justifies the focus of this review on MAS and MPC methods for EMS in MGs.The essential objective of a systematic literature review is to identify, assess, and interpret specific subjects in a certain field of study [43,44].The available databases have been browsed and an architecture has proposed for selecting the potential literature to be analyzed in detail.Moreover, the methodology of [45], known as backward and forward search, is used in some cases; to further identify suitable publications.Firstly, the language of all manuscripts is checked (English and non-English).The next level of removal is continued by screening the title of the research works.The third level is filtering the title and abstract of the papers.The fourth is to filter the remaining papers based on the full text.The final step is to categorize the total available papers as demonstrated in Figure 4. Total  The keywords search and screening performed as below:

(p14.1) 1. MAS-based methods: "smart energy system", "microgrid", "energy management", "multi-agent systems".a.A total of 176 papers were found and 3 of them were omitted due to non-English language.b.Around 35 papers removed as they are significantly non-relevant subject areas, and the remaining papers were screened based on title, abstracts, quality of paper, and relevancy to the MAS control and optimization methods.(~75 papers, shown in Figure 5).The selected articles sorted to examine separately the MAS control methods in terms of stages, type of control (decentralized/distributed), the methodology employed, and complexity as specified below.
## (s18) (i)
(p18.0) Flexibility in EMS of MGs through MAS: In MAS methods, the MG components are considered as individual or autonomous agents with objective functions to achieve with minimal information exchange with the neighboring agents through communication.The autonomous nature of MAS helps in adding more RES and ESS.It leads to the effective utilization of flexible, locally generated energy, and reduces grid imports and emissions.The autonomous and scalable nature of the MAS framework enhances the plug-and-play capability of MG-EMS.When the MGs are operated in power deficit mode, the flexible operation of EMS through MAS is achieved by sending control signals to the agents that can participate in optimal DSM and DR or load shedding.Similarly, in the power surplus mode, the energy availability is communicated and stored for future use to reduce peak loads in the system.As the utility grid considered as an agent, it is ready to supply whenever MG-EMS suffers from energy deficiency.This greatly enhances the system's flexibility in handling sudden failures of MG component and satisfies the local load demand.The autonomous, scalable, sociable, and reactive abilities are the MAS characteristics that offer flexibility in the EMS of MGs.(ii)

(p18.1) Affordability in EMS of MGs through MAS: The economic operation of MG is the primary goal of EMS.The consideration of local as well as global constraints in the MAS methods provides efficient EM in the MGs by solving the EDP problem.Active and reactive characteristics of MAS control provide continuous monitoring of MG systems and effectively utilize the available energy.This enhances the utilization of locally produced energy and avoids additional power trading from the grid.This reduces the cost of operation and increases affordability to the different types of consumers.The MAS control methods are popular in providing decentralized and/or distributed control architecture.Thus, these are computationally less expensive than centralized control methods.The active and reactive features of MAS enhance the affordability of the MGs.In distributed approaches, the minimum operating cost and optimal power output of all the DERs achieved with cooperative/consensus methods.

(p18.2) In AC-MGs, consensus can be obtained through incremental cost consensus (ICC) or gradient-based distributed methods [77].Similarly in DC-MGs and hybrid MGs, ICC approaches can be extended [91].These are easily possible with MAS approaches as different techniques can achieve consensus between agents.(iii)

(p18.3) Security in EMS of MGs through MAS: Security of supply is most important for any energy system, especially for MGs operating in the islanded mode.The loads should be supplied by the efficiently scheduled available energy resources of MGs-EMS with the amount of energy requested.To satisfy the operational constraints of MG and its components, MAS methods with intelligent and interactive communication capabilities between the agents are most suitable.For example, the MAS development using JADE provides the communication capability through the ACL (agent communication language) following the FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) protocols.The possibility of single-point failure of the MG-EMS can be avoided by the decentralized/distributed architecture of MAS through communication.Moreover, most sensitive loads can be given preference at the same time while maintaining the supply-demand balance, frequency, and voltage regulation in hierarchical control that uses the MAS approach to enhance the MG-EMS security.Secure communication and avoiding communication delays are the challenging aspects of MAS methods.The uncertainty and intermittent nature of the RES, security, and health aspects of batteries/ESS are considered during the control method modeling for MG-EMS.In the case of local agent failure, the isolation of faulty component of MG is possible, which improves stability and provide secure operation of MG and its components.

(p18.4) Table 3 presents the works that used MAS approaches in different types of control architectures for MG-EMS.It also shows the objectives identified along with the addressed energy trilemma element.As it is clear from the table, the affordability aspect of energy trilemma is by default included in the EMS studies of any MG as the cost-optimal operation always desired.Later, the effective utilization of available energy resources, storage elements, DG, DSM, and DR are given importance.This enhances the system's flexibility.Finally, due to the modern MG challenges such as complex dynamic behaviors of MG components, uncertain environment, multi-mode operation of MGs, supply-demand balance, and system security become more important.The security aspect of energy trilemma has gained attention in the recent MGs-EMS studies with the increase in the number of individual components and developments of communication infrastructure among them.These individual agents in the MGs have dependent and independent operating nature to supply/receive reliable, secure energy, and increased concern over secure communication.The objective functions and their problem formulations include linear, non-linear, mixed integer and other difficult characteristics which require multi-stage control and efficient optimization algorithms (for detailed mathematical formulations, kindly refer to the respective original publications).The inference made from Table 3 is that the implementation of MAS, AI-based, hybrid (two or more) control approaches for MGs-EMS is gaining popularity over the other methods.Distributed and hierarchical control architectures with these methodologies are essential to address the energy trilemma (flexibility, affordability, security) issues in modern MGs.Based on the analysis performed, the constituents of MAS for achieving energy trilemma aspects in MGs-EMS are presented in Figure 8, i.e., MAS characteristics and abilities that help in developing various control architectures to solve objectives of EMS by employing different kinds of optimization algorithms are depicted in Figure 8.
## (s21) (ii) Affordability in EMS of MGs through MPC:
(p21.0) The problems with the nature of mixed integer linear and nonlinear characteristics considering several operating constraints are solved effectively using MPC-based methods.The UC, EDP, and optimal operation of MG-EMS also have a similar nature and were addressed widely using MPC methods.The integration of different optimization techniques such as robust, rolling, and stochastic optimization helped in achieving affordable and optimal EM within the MGS that employed MPC-based control approaches.The self-triggering feature of MPC will reduce the communication infrastructure requirement that further helps in developing an affordable control system for MG-EMS.The energy imports and exports from the grid are continuously monitored at the control unit.This helps in achieving the affordable and economical operation of grid-connected MG. (iii)

(p21.1) Security in EMS of MGs through MPC: The ability to handle any disturbances and uncertainties is the most beneficial aspect of MPC control approaches for MG-EMS.The uncertainty issue of MG-EMS to enhance security is well addressed using the MPCbased methods with robust optimization.MPC control approaches are reactive in nature and can integrate new updated or forecasted information into the EMS.This improves system security by satisfying the system and component-level constraints.MPC with a rolling horizon approach reduces forecast error for real-time online operation and provides stable operation of MG.By doing so, MPC can predict the future behavior of the system that has constraints.The decentralized/distributed architecture of MPC used to control the power flows of the complicated hybrid power system.MPC has a fast transient response since the main role of MPC is to integrate new updated data and forecast information.Additionally, giving precedence to the most sensitive loads simultaneously with preserving supply-demand equilibrium, frequency regulation, and voltage regulation in hierarchical control that employed the MPC approach improves the security of the MG-EMS.When modeling the control method for MG-EMS, the security and health aspects of batteries and ESS, as well as the uncertainty and intermittent nature of RES, are considered.

(p21.2) MPC uses many optimization techniques including rolling (receding) optimization, finite horizon optimization, convex programming, MILP optimization, and multivariable optimization as shown in Table 4.The constituents of MPC-based control approaches for achieving the energy trilemma in MG-EMS summarized in Table 4 are illustrated in Figure 9.In summary, the MAS and MPC frameworks are well used in control methods for MGs due to their structural features and control operations.The two mentioned control approaches have the majority share among the recent application to EMS.As discussed in the papers mentioned in Tables 1, 3 and 4, the MAS framework is known for its advantages such as decentralized/distributed architecture, communication capability among the system components, and characteristics such as autonomous, social, active, proactive, and scalability.This results in developing several research works that use MAS as the main control engine in all the levels of control in MGs (such as primary, secondary, and tertiary control in MGs).At the same time, conventional control techniques such as MPC and their advancements are widely popular methods for EMS in MGs.MPC possesses a variety of beneficial traits [134,135].It is possible to incorporate physical constraints directly and intuitively, and have an excellent dynamic, reliable control system.Direct control signals produced results in simplicity.Complex optimization problems are made easier to solve by integrating a variety of techniques into the MPC control approach.In addition, researchers working on MPC advancements in MGs must consider different factors such as RES intermittency, load-sharing accuracy, circulating currents, grid stability, etc.Finally, for the EMS in MGs with the requirements of distributive control architectures, consensus, and effective management among the MG components, plug-andplay and scalability in adding RES, ESS, etc., and services such as DSM and DR, MASbased intelligent interactive approaches are beneficial over MPC and other methods.However, due to the adaptability, capacity to apply in any field, predictive and feedback nature, accounting uncertainty, and intuitive characteristics, MPC-based methods are advantageous in hierarchical control architectures of MGs-EMS with RES, ESS, and dynamic loads.Additionally, to overcome the pitfalls of each other, the ensemble of MAS and MPCbased methods can be a possibility to use at different levels of control in MGs.
## (s22) Optimization Algorithms in the MGs-EMS:
(p22.0) The use of the control and optimization method is based on the type of MG structure, individual entity objective functions, and their formulations.The classification of optimization techniques used in EMS includes AI-based, conventional mathematical, metaheuristic, and others.Fuzzy logic, game theory, multi-agent, neural network, and reinforcement learning methods come under the category of AI-based methods.Dynamic programming, robust programming, stochastic programming, bilevel programming, mixed integer programming, MPC-based methods are conventional approaches.Swarm intelligence, evolutionary, and heuristic approaches are of metaheuristic type.Hybrid methods and groups of two or more of the above-described types are categorized as other methods for achieving the optimization objectives of MG-EMS.In [6], the authors presented a comprehensive review of optimization techniques for addressing several control objectives in the EMS of MGs.Four major types of techniques and their subclassifications are presented in detail.Moreover, an interesting qualitative analysis was performed among methods that solve the UC, ED, forecast, and demand side management (DSM) objectives.It concluded that mixed integer programming, MAS approaches, and metaheuristics such as PSO are mostly used methods to address MGs-EMS.MAS-based methods are best for the MG to provide solutions for UC, and DSM with high efficiency, reliability, and adaptability, whereas metaheuristics such as PSO are simple and reliable, better for forecasting and ED.The ensemble of these methods collectively achieves the best results for solving EMS problems of MGs.Therefore, the idea of using hybrid approaches that include futuristic EMS requirements in a collaborative MG community with accurate forecasting, and scheduling to improve economic and computational benefits paramount in the literature.
## (s23) Future Research Directions and Discussion
(p23.0) The review presented in this paper aims to check how the energy trilemma is considered in the MPC and MAS-based EM methods of MGs.Usually, affordability, flexibility, and security are considered in different ways.The review reveals that the EM problem or the control and optimization problem was a mono-objective where a single objective function related to the operational costs of the microgrid widely addressed.In this case, one of three terms of the energy trilemma was considered, and the other two terms were included implicitly in the problem constraints or were supposed to be provided through the microgrids architecture and constituents.For example, including the energy storage or the demand-side response programs can provide flexibility to the network.Moreover, having different types of generators will prioritize the security of the supply.This security of supply can be affected by a failure of the communication system.Hence, some research papers considered these aspects by developing a centralized energy management system.When more than one element of the energy trilemma is included in energy management, the control/optimization problem becomes multi-objective.The objective function was formulated to reduce the operational costs (affordability aspects), increase the security of supply by imposing penalties in case of unmet demand (security aspects), and increase flexibility by incentivizing the utilization of locally generated and/or traded energy.The environmental dimension was considered by incentivizing the use of local renewable energy.The current review reveals that the following aspects related to EMS of microgrids require to be considered further by the research community:

(p23.1) Stability of microgrid: Issues related to the stability of MG affect the security of supply.Over or under frequency and voltage are considered currently through the balance of active and reactive power flows in a three-phase balanced microgrid.However, the imbalance in loads and impact of non-linear loads on the microgrid stability have been ignored in the literature.Hence, there is a need for an EMS that considers the imbalance in load and the impact of non-linear loads, and to maintain the MG stability.

(p23.2) Resilience of EMS against cyber-attacks: Cyber threats affect the security of the supply of MG.The focus of the current research was to reduce communication delays in distributed and decentralized architectures.However, it is essential to develop a resilient EMS that can deal with cyber-attacks in a way the energy supply will not be affected.

(p23.3) Scalability of EMS of a microgrid: EVs significantly affect the flexibility and considered widely in the MG-EMS studies.EVs are static energy storage systems with constraints related to their availability; for example, EVs will not be available for specific periods.Currently, the EMS of MGs charge the EV batteries during excess generation and discharge them to cover the load during generation shortage.However, it is essential to develop an MG-EMS that can consider the dynamic behavior of the EVs in the microgrid; the capacity and the stored energy are variable, and related to the drivers' preferences/behaviors and many other parameters.The change in the number and size of EVs available at a specific time period arises scalability issues for the EMS.Considering hybrid ESS [163], battery health degradation, state-of-the-charge of batteries are also should be accounted in EMS for MGs with storage systems.These directly affect the operational costs, which in turn impact MG-EMS affordability and security.

(p23.4) EMS algorithm advancements: Many methods developed based on the system of systems (SoS) approaches for MGs and smart grids [164][165][166][167][168][169].These methods are easy to implement and have supervisory control nature.However, these fail to provide optimal EMS.MAS and MPC-based methods are effective and optimal but dependent on MG complexity, architectures, or model.Therefore, combining SoS and optimal-based methods provide efficient and optimal solutions needed for MG-EMS.In addition, there is a need for AI advancement in MGs control and optimization approaches that enable EM in futuristic energy systems are required.In the MAS control framework, the agents may have objectives of conflicting nature and require efficient optimization algorithms.In solving such complex problems with conflicting objectives, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are well known.However, the applications of the MOEAs are littleknown in MGs-EMS studies.MOEAs in the control methods for MGs-EMS can be a potential application and result in a set of Pareto optimal EM solutions.
## (s24) Conclusions
(p24.0) This review presented the energy trilemma perspective for MG-EMS by categorizing the objectives, control and optimization methods in terms of flexibility, affordability, and security.The focus is given to the MAS and MPC-based approaches with different control architectures for energy management in MGs.The objectives that affect each element of the energy trilemma are presented in detail.The literature was scanned for MAS and MPC-based control methods from the energy trilemma perspective, and several inferences made from the existing research.The detailed analysis of MAS and MPC approaches, optimization methods, and their constituents to achieve the energy trilemma presented in this review can provide a fresh perspective for MGs-EMS.The MAS and MPC methods are used in all types of control architectures.However, MAS control complexities rise due to interactions and market transactions [170] in interconnected MGs.Incorporating AI-based machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms in the MAS-based methods has drawn attention recently to developing EMS for MGs with ICT technologies.Though the MPC approaches are used widely in developing EMS due to their fast dynamic response and reactive features in handling uncertainties, they require high computational power.Adaptive predictive control with AI and hybrid control techniques and practical SoS methods such as logical evolution operator-based techniques (epsilon operator) are employed in MPC to decrease the computational complexity.Finally, future recommendations and analysis related to stability, scalability, and resiliency of MGs-EMS that affect flexibility, affordability, and security in addition to EMS algorithm improvements are presented to benefit the MG research community.
