## (s1) Scr -Serum Creatinine, UO -Urine Output, RRT -Renal Replacement Therapy
(p1.0) There are also changes in the classification of SAP.The original Atlanta classification of 1992 was revised and updated by the working group and identifies two phases of acute pancreatitis: early (first one or two weeks) and late (thereafter).The severity of AP is categorized into three levels: mild, moderately severe and severe, according to the incidence of local and systemic organ complications 14 .
## (s3) DIAGNOSIS
(p3.0) Early recognition of AKI in SAP is an important factor for potentially life-saving procedures in critically ill patients.We have no definite parameter for daily clinical routine for exact early determination of AKI diagnosis.AKI has traditionally been defined and detected by measuring serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentration which can significantly increase after substantial kidney injury and with time delay 35,36 .The concentration of serum creatinine depends on the muscle mass and can be significantly lower in elderly and cachectic patients.Serum creatinine is also secreted by the renal tubule and this secretion can be modified by pharmacological agents 35 .The glomerular filtration rate is determined from 24 hour collection of urine or using the calculation method of MDRD or Cockroft-Gault.However, both of these calculation methods are affected by errors as they are based on serum creatinine levels.
## (s5) Treatment of underlying disease (SAP)
(p5.0) The treatment of SAP depends on illness severity and also on the patient's clinical condition.After the diagnosis of SAP, it is necessary to predict severity of the disease using various scoring systems: APACHE II, SOFA or BISAP.In the management of SAP treatment multi-discipline measures are an important step.The basic principles of SAP treatment includes usually: a) emerging hospitalisation, b) monitoring of vital function, c) restriction of oral intake, d) adequate enteral and parenteral nutrition, e) adequate analgesic treatment, f) the emplacement of nasogastric tube, g) antibiotic treatment for infectious complications, h) percutaneous drainage, endoscopic therapy or abdominal laparotomy.The basic standard for diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis is contrast-enhanced computed -tomography.However, cross-sectional imaging in the early phase of evaluation is not associated with improved outcome, but is very important and usually used between 48-72 h after hospitalisation.Antibiotic treatment in SAP is still a controversial option and some studies recommend use of antibiotics agents only if the complications of sepsis are presented but not for their prevention [63][64][65] .In addition, broad spectrum antibiotics with good tissue penetration are necessary to prevent infection in SAP after CT-proven pancreatic necrosis 66 .Patients suffering from infected necrosis, massive hemorrhage, bowel perforation, sterile necrosis with clinical deterioration or symptomatic organized necrosis are usually indicated for surgical intervention 67 .

(p5.1) Experimental animal studies, have reported the protective effects of dexamethasone on multiple organ injury in rats with SAP.There was no significant difference in survival between the dexamethasone treatment group and the control group of rats.Nevertheless, the pancreas, liver, lung and kidney pathological scores were significantly lower in the dexamethasone treatment group (P<0.001 to P=0.046 respectively) (ref. 68).In another study, the same authors showed the effect of dexamethasone on NF-κB expression in multiple organs in rats with SAP.They concluded that dexamethasone can lower the plasma amylase, plasma endotoxin, serum TNF-α and reduce the NF-κB expression in the liver and kidney and apoptosis may be a protective response to pancreatic cell injury 1 .Esrefoglu M. summarized experimental and clinical evidence of antioxidant therapy e.g ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol, beta-carotene, melatonin, carnitine and N-acetyl-cysteine in cases of AP.Use of antioxidant regimens in the management of AP as a supplement and combined with conventional therapy are reasonable, but there are no sufficient data for using them alone 17 .Another study on rats showed an anti-inflammatory effect of pentoxifylline by inhibiting NF-κB activation in acute pancreatitis and pancreatic ischaemia-reperfusion (I-R) models.The aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the effect of pentoxifylline administration in a rat model of pancreatic I-R injury.Significant reductions in serum TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 were observed in the group treated with pentoxiphylline compared with the group without pentoxifylline (P<0.05).The histologic score was significantly lower in pentoxifylline-treated animals, denoting less severe pan-creatic histologic damage.Pentoxifylline administration in this study reduced the systemic inflammatory response, the pancreatic histological lesion and renal dysfunction in pancreatic I-R injury 69 .
## (s7) Renal function supportive measures
(p7.0) Significant risk factors for AKI in patients with SAP include history of renal disease, hypoxemia, and ACS.Measures that can prevent AKI include homeostasis maintenance, adequate perfusion of the kidneys, adequate oxygenation, and abdominal decompression to avoid ACS.As mentioned previously, adequate renal perfusion is the most desired measure for support and preservation of renal function.Further, aggressive volume resuscitation might preserve cardiac output, but is an independent predictor of developing secondary ACS (ref. 94).In patients with IAH and septic shock, use of norepinephrine (NE) probably has an appropriate effect on maintaining renal perfusion.NE has been reported to increase renal blood flow, urine output and creatinine clearance in experimental and human sepsis through a combined increase of renal perfusion pressure and an increase in renal vascular conductance [95][96][97][98] .Norepinehrine is more potent than dopamine at doses ranging from 0.01-3.3µg/kg/min to achieve increase of MAP in hypotensive patients after fluid resuscitation 98,99 .The targeted mean MAP with NE therapy varied in several studies, but was as high as 75 mmHg.Improvements in renal function with increased  101 ).On the other hand, furosemide may aid in the management of fluid overload by increasing natriuresis and diuresis 102 .The option of using diuretic therapy in the case of decreasing urine output in early AKI is controversial and we need relevant randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trials of early furosemid therapy in these cases.It is important for eventually further recommendation of this treatment 103 .

(p7.1) In one experimental animal study, Zhang XP et al. reported some protective effects and the mechanism of Baicalin and Octreotide on renal injury in rats with SAP.The authors showed from histopathological tissue microarray sample of kidney inhibition of inflammatory mediators, decreasing the expression level of Bcl-2 protein and enhancing the apoptosis-promoting effect of Bax dimmer to induce apoptosis of renal tubular cells 104 .
