(p1.0) The definition of BMES refers to a number of clinical conditions characterized by a BME pattern with a self-limiting course.Most of them are found in the lower limbs, such as TOH, regional migratory osteoporosis (RMO), and transient post-traumatic BMES.TOH is the most frequent described condition among BMES (Fig. 4).It generally affects middle-aged men (30-50 years) or women in the third trimester of pregnancy (73).In most cases no triggering events can be found, but an abnormal mechanical stress (such as a long walk) has been described in some cases.The main symptom is represented by acute hip pain, exacerbated by loading, and is often associated with severe functional disability.In a few weeks from the onset of pain a diffuse osteoporosis of the femoral head can be observed on Xray.MRI shows a large homogenous BME involving the femoral head and sometimes extending into the femoral neck (5).A local increased uptake of the tracer can also be observed on bone scan.The clinical course of the disease is often self-limiting, with a spontaneous resolution in 4-24 months, but a possible evolution toward an osteonecrosis has been proposed, even if it is still an object of debate (8).Treatment with BPS seems to significantly shorten disease duration (74).Even if pathogenic mechanisms underlying TOH have not yet been clearly identified, histological examination of bone biopsies harvested from patients with BME of the hip undergoing core decompression treatment revealed a diffuse interstitial edema of the marrow cavities associated with fibrous tissue deposition, angiogenesis and fat cell fragmentation (4).No increased osteoclastic activity was found, but trabeculae covered by osteoid with a reduced hydroxyapatite content, suggesting that radiological osteoporosis could be better related to bone mineral changes than to a true osteoclast mediated bone loss.A high intramedullary pressure was measured during the coring procedure.

(p1.1) A clinical course similar to TOH characterizes RMO and transient post-traumatic  Even if a BME pattern on MRI can be found in some patients affected by a Complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I), BME should not be considered a distinctive feature of CRPS-I ( 75).Nevertheless, it is a common mistake on the part of radiologists to refer to BME as an algodystrophy, even in absence of clinical hallmarks of this condition.CRPS-I is a complex regional painful condition which usually involves the extremities (hand or foot) and can be associated with sensory, autonomic, motor and trophic changes.Although an increased local uptake of the tracer on bone scan can be observed in a high percentage of cases in the early phases of the disease, recent diagnostic criteria only rely on clinical features (76).The clinical course of the disease usually goes through different clinical phases: an early warm stage, in which pain is associated with edema, functional limitation and often trophic and sensory symptoms, sometimes is followed by a dystrophic phase in which edema progressively reduces; then an atrophic phase can frequently be observed, when skin atrophy and contractures become prevalent.Unlike BMES, CRPS-I has a self-limiting course only in a minority of patients, while in most cases it evolves toward permanent disability.Clinical identification of patients affected by CRPS-I is therefore mandatory, since the clinical course can be modified by the treatment (77).

(p1.2) The recent demonstration of a good response to BPS treatment in patients affected by CRPS-I may allow a better clarification of possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease (71).Even if the characteristic increased uptake of the tracer on the bone scan could have suggested an osteoclast-mediated pathogenesis for the disease, studies on markers of osteoclastic activity and histopathological investigations failed to demonstrate an enhanced osteoclastic activity in CRPS-I (78).While increased blood flow and microvascular permeability could be responsible for the radiotracer uptake in the early phases, it is likely that the radiotracer accumulation in later phases depends on passive chemoadsorption of the BPS to hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals related to an increased number of available binding sites on the bone surface due to the disappearance of lining cells.The local osteoporosis that can be observed on x-rays, rather than an osteoclast-mediated process, is more likely to be related to chemical dissolution of HAP crystals due to local hypoxia and acidosis, as can be inferred by histological studies in which a disappearance of HAP crystals and an elevated osteoid volume was demonstrated (4).In this pathogenic model, BPS could act with mechanisms that are not usually active when these molecules are employed to treat osteoporosis, due to the high local concentration achieved in CRPS-I.The efficacy of BPS in this clinical condition may rely on their ability to prevent HAP crystal dissolution in an acid milieu (79) and to decrease lactic acid production from various cell types (
