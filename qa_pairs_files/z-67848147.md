## (s6) Burning of the lignocellulosic powder fuel in cyclone and flare facilities
(p6.0) For burning particles smaller than 250 mm, cyclone set-ups have been suggested [39].When such set-ups are designed, attention should be directed to the fact that biomass-derived fuel has to remain in the high-temperature zone for the time sufficient for the volatile components to evolve before the carbon residue starts reacting [40].Laboratory tests show that burning under these conditions ensures low concentrations of carbon monoxide CO and carbon in the waste gas.
