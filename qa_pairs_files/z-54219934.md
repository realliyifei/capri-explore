## (s3) Parental mediation
(p3.0) Parental mediation, according to Clark [5], should be taken as a means of recognising that parents take a role in managing and regulating their children's Internet experiences. Furthermore, Kirwil [20] contends that parental mediation of children's Internet use can be defined "as the regulatory strategies that parents introduce to maximize benefits and minimize their children's risks from Internet use". A minor difference of understanding is evident between Clark's [5] and Kirwil's [20] view of parental mediation in that Kirwil infers that the experience can be positive through the use of the words 'maximise' and 'benefits' and negative through the words 'minimise' and 'risk'. In this review, Kirwil's [20] definition of parental mediation is used.
