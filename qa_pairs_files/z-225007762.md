## (s6) Management Control Systems for Sustainability
(p6.0) Contributions to SD at micro-levels can only be efficient when enterprises start making tangible efforts towards sustainability. Commonly, only partial aspects of SD are addressed at organizational level, with environmental responsibility and innovation being the most chosen route, while social actions are often disregarded [22].

(p6.1) Environmental innovation strategies alone, however, are not a guarantee for the achievement of successful financial and sustainability outcomes [39]. In this sense, research suggests that only if enterprises align their sustainability and innovation strategies with internal controls, will they be able to gain performance improvements and make noticeable progress towards SD [22,39].
## (s7) Methodology
(p7.0) The systematic literature review was developed in four stages: (i) choice of keywords and inclusion criteria, (ii) search strategy, (iii) study screening and selection, (iv) extraction and synthesis of sources. Each step is described in detail below. Boundary systems draw on a set of tools directed towards internal and external stakeholders (employees, supply chain, customers, environment, communities), including codes of ethics and conduct, guidelines, quality certifications and labeling standards. These measures are used to stimulate innovation thinking, set criteria for supplier selection, ensure product and process quality and compliance with sustainability norms, as well as prevent environmental, socio-economic and internal risks.

(p7.1) Firms make use of diagnostic systems to develop measurable outcomes for their CSR practices and assess their cost-effectiveness and value creation, as well as any deviations from strategic targets. Through these systems, companies are able to internalize the relative net benefits and enable CSR decision-making on the one hand, and communicate performance results to stakeholders on the other. Internally, social indicators and reports should be used to provide feedback to human resources, however, research found that not many companies adopt a social diagnostic system [45].

(p7.2) Interactive control systems allow companies to leverage both primary and secondary stakeholders' (non-governmental organizations, activists, communities and suppliers) opinions in order to gain insight into additional CSR and sustainability policies, and therefore identify further opportunities and threats (that might undermine the organizational image) carrying an impact on CSR.

(p7.3) Informal controls are used to sustain the above-mentioned formal processes. Their purpose is to project the organizational climate onto an enterprise's internal and external stakeholders, so that they gain awareness of how it helps to strengthen CSR culture and commitment [7,22,45].

(p7.4) In spite of the key role played by formal controls in signaling a company's consideration of its stakeholders and responsibility goals, they are not capable of emphasizing sustainability in relation to their internal culture on their own. In other words, informal systems alone would lead to unstable CSR management [46]. According to research, formal and informal controls are actually mutually reinforcing and their combination can prevent any perplexities or opportunistic behavior and positively stimulate the members of a firm to implement higher-level CSR [7,22,45].
## (s9) Choice of Keywords and Selection Criteria
(p9.0) Keywords for the literature search were chosen based on the main research question: 'How can SMEs in cooperative relationships leverage on sustainability-integrated MCS tools to effectively implement CSR?' (Figure 3). This question was divided into three main topics, namely (a) type of relationship, (b) sustainability concepts for companies, and (c) internal control systems. For each of the three conceptual categories, a series of associated terms were picked for the next step:

(p9.1) (a) Business/corporate/manufacturing group, group of companies, intercompany, intragroup, SME network; (b) Sustainability, sustainable management, sustainable development (goals), responsibility ethics, corporate social responsibility, corporate social performance, corporate sustainability, environmental social governance performance (ESG); (c) Management control (system), management/managerial accounting, cost accounting/management, strategic control, corporate governance, board of directors.

(p9.2) Subsequently, the following criteria were determined in order to select the articles for review: (1) only articles in English, excluding grey literature (e.g., conference proceedings); (2) inclusion of environmental, social and economic corporate sustainability, not economic sustainability alone;

(p9.3) (3) only studies combining both group and/or SME organizational forms with corporate sustainable practices were included; (4) SME literature was deemed eligible only if it examined networks, sustainability-oriented innovations or social/environmental accounting; (5) focus on the corporate-level SD, not on a specific country's SD (country-specific BG examples are, however, included, e.g., Korean chaebols); (6) business cases are considered only if discussed in scientific articles, no short news reporting/cover stories; (7) results restricted to the for-profit sector, no third-sector organizations Sustainability 2020, 12, 7722 9 of 42 (e.g., cooperatives); (8) mainly the manufacturing industry is taken into account, no services; (9) not restricted to sustainability in the production process, rather, including studies on sustainability as a strategic asset for corporate governance. Subsequently, the following criteria were determined in order to select the articles for review: (1) only articles in English, excluding grey literature (e.g., conference proceedings); (2) inclusion of environmental, social and economic corporate sustainability, not economic sustainability alone; (3) only studies combining both group and/or SME organizational forms with corporate sustainable practices were included; (4) SME literature was deemed eligible only if it examined networks, sustainability-oriented innovations or social/environmental accounting; (5) focus on the corporatelevel SD, not on a specific country's SD (country-specific BG examples are, however, included, e.g., Korean chaebols); (6) business cases are considered only if discussed in scientific articles, no short news reporting/cover stories; (7) results restricted to the for-profit sector, no third-sector organizations (e.g., cooperatives); (8) mainly the manufacturing industry is taken into account, no services; (9) not restricted to sustainability in the production process, rather, including studies on sustainability as a strategic asset for corporate governance.
## (s16) Descriptive Analysis: Literature Trends
(p16.0) The present section provides some numerical insights into the 48 studies included in the review. To begin with, the articles retrieved were published in the period 2007-2020 ( Figure 5), with a peak in publications in 2018.

(p16.1) Splitting the time span under observation into three clusters of uniform cumulative periods, it is possible to notice that there has been a constantly growing trend in publications on corporate sustainability management in SMEs and BGs. Specifically, while the increase in SME studies has been less than proportional, research on practices in BGs has outweighed that on SMEs since 2014-2017 (first appearing in 2010). Nevertheless, considering the entire sample, the interest in either SMEs or BGs was balanced (n = 21 each), likewise for emerging (n = 22) and developed economies (23). Papers specifically analyzing sustainability in BGs of SMEs were extremely rare (n = 6), and, cumulatively, it seems that interest in them has gradually decreased.
## (s18) The Influence of Group Affiliation and Networks on the Intensity of CSR Implementation
(p18.0) The literature on the relation between BG affiliation and CSR intensity features mixed evidence, the majority of which, however, is positive. Compared to stand-alone firms, group affiliation normally resulted in better CSR performance overall, including environmental, social and governance ratings (ESG-a proxy for CSR but based on more precise criteria for assessment), and for its individual social and environmental components [5,6,[59][60][61]. The social score seems to yield an even stronger effect in larger groups and for such dimensions as employment, human rights, community and product responsibility, but less in terms of safety, training and diversity. Concerning the environmental aspect, remission and resource reduction, as well as product innovation/R&D are the factors responsible for raising CSR intensity in BGs [59,60].

(p18.1) Conversely, other studies suggested that publicly listed groups in particular do not aggressively invest in CSR activities [62], and that the higher cost of equity for disclosing nonfinancial information, makes CSR reporting less valuable to BGs [63].

(p18.2) As for the positive BG-CSR correlation, this depends on the intrinsic characteristics of BGs themselves. First of all, size (several companies in one group) and years of experience significantly affect corporate sustainability. Specifically, larger and older BGs have a higher availability of resources, therefore it is easier for them to invest in CSR [59,64].

(p18.3) Second, the support provided by BG promoters (families or controlling corporations) is equally important. Unlike the promoters of unaffiliated firms (individuals), which are exclusively interested in profits, promoters of BGs are genetically interlinked with society, and thus feel compelled to also nurture socio-economic wealth [61]. Family control, counter to the belief that it is only a source of opportunistic expropriation of CSR investments, proved to be an excellent leverage for increasing a BG's environmental disclosure propensity, mainly if leadership is taken by a family CEO [64]. Some authors, however, state that it is group affiliation itself that mitigates the negative effects of family ownership on CSR, and this is only true for non-individual family owners [5]. As for controlling companies, they exert significant influence on subsidiaries, both if these operate in their parent company's sector, or in a different industry but with notable direction and coordination by the holding. This leads affiliated firms to adopt their same sustainability practices and improves their individual corporate social disclosure, demonstrating that a BG is indeed a united economic entity, even when it comes to sustainability performance [65]. Peer pressure by likewise affiliated firms plays an influential role too. As a matter of fact, if some affiliates already have previously disclosed environmental information, the disclosure propensity among the other group members increases [64]. The external BG influence dynamic is also to be noted. When it comes to the promotion of socio-economic wealth, BGs can truly make a difference, as they wield considerable political power in shaping the local legal framework for their respective societal contexts, thanks to collaborations with governments [66]. Their sustainable business operations often inspire other BGs to transition towards CS too [6].

(p18.4) BGs do not primarily resort to CSR-related tools to address narrowly defined environmental issues; they instead rely on its insurance-like effect to obtain reputational gains [59,64]. Sustaining or restoring group reputation is particularly important during negative group-specific externalities (e.g., dissemination of bad news among member firms) [59], as well as when members need to be protected from inherent reputational risks emerging from embezzlement schemes potentially put in place by family owners [64]. A good reputation particularly helps BGs to convince international stakeholders during the internationalization process, when they have a tendency to communicate more CSR activities [67]. The one case mentioned in which BGs do not need to worry about recognition is when they hold the dual status of state-owned BG. These organizations are in fact naturally afforded both legitimacy and protection from negative CSR performance, making them less compelled to conduct sustainability-related activities to maintain their reputation [68].
## (s20) CSR Processes in SME Networks and Corporate Groups
(p20.0) In general, cooperative and community-based approaches to CSR (e.g., strategic alliances) between multiple SMEs, like in the case of networks/clusters and BGs, lead to major advantages for the individual firms taking part in them, not only in short-term economic terms but also from a long-term strategic perspective, by simplifying the implementation of sustainability management policies and helping to maintain the relative tools over time [94]. The following section analyzes how some of the sustainability tools from the previous section were extended to an entire group or network. For this purpose, it will be useful to understand how a BG relates to a network. Groups of companies, in fact, can be seen as having two layers of independent networks: the inter-organizational network, represented by the headquarters and branch offices (core BG), and the intra-organizational network, consisting of the core company, as well as suppliers and associated firms sharing the same goal. One of the articles used these definitions to illustrate the process of knowledge creation for the implementation of a network-wide environmental policy for "zero emissions". After the initial direction provided by top management in announcing the program for environmental management, middle management organized information flows about the new policy from branch offices to construction sites, hauliers and subcontractors in their allocated sites. This drove the arrangement of the inter-organizational network towards stronger ties (more qualitative information and cooperation, decreased opportunism) and density (shared norms and reputational monitoring), as well as effective externalization and socialization of BG's sense of CSR value. Then, middle management emphasized the centrality of corporate headquarters by serving as mediators between them, the construction managers of each branch office and the staff from the environmental improvement department. This bridging led to the sharing and combination of concrete knowledge for setting a proper path for CSR development. Next, branch office managers encouraged hauliers and subcontractors to design, test and share information on environmental management, externalizing the process to the entire intra-organizational network. Then, they helped supervise this process and provided operative training, internalizing this whole approach [100].

(p20.1) Another study showed how the endorsement of an EMS by an intra-organizational network of SMEs can be accomplished using a four-stage decision-making process, representing an adaptation of the ISO 14001 certification model. For the successful implementation of an EMS within an SME network, the network should already exist, the companies should not be competing against one another (for longer term network survival), a network promoter or facilitator should be appointed to carry out the development of the EMS, and it should be possible to decouple, for the innovation in question, the activities that are common across the network from those that address specific company issues. In the first stage, the management of each network company fully commits and accepts that it will take 6-12 months at least to initiate the project. This period will be utilized to build trust among the network members through discussions on projects that would appeal to all of them and, hence, can be achieved by the network as a whole (e.g., decreased environmental impact, and subsequently firm expenses). The second phase revolves around the implementation of those macro network activities, including the development of an environmental policy that shows each organization's commitment to the environment, the identification of the attributes (of products, services and activities) with the most impact on the environment, the awareness and understanding by all staff of any possible legal requirements, the establishment of environmental goals as per policy, and finally the planning of actions for achieving these targets. These first two stages follow the same structure across all network participants, while the remaining two have to be adapted to the peculiar situation of each firm. However, they will be carried out only if the network unanimously agrees to undergo extensive organizational change and work towards obtaining a certification, if satisfied with the results of the first two stages' in-depth analysis (3rd stage). In case a unanimous consent is reached, during the last phase each company will have to start implementing customized processes for establishing EMS responsibilities, providing employee training, managing operations in line with the environmental policy and objectives, developing procedures for identifying, correcting and preventing emergencies and problems, and periodically reviewing or auditing the EMS with the aim of improving it [73].

(p20.2) Concerning the final EMS phase of sustainability reporting, the legitimization BGs and networks are looking for from their CSR policy can be achieved by changing internal systems to include an auditability process. This way accounting technologies (group-wide information systems and data documentation, accounting instructions, books closing and internal controls), which are deemed an exemplary, authoritative and objective approach when it comes to reputation (towards external stakeholders, assurance providers or the top management), ensure that SER becomes an ongoing practice. The three essential elements of this integrated system, according to one of the studies, are data capture (information on data flow from site to group level/consolidation), data quality and reliability (at site accounting accuracy; its expertise can be translated to nonfinancial data), and a specific group social and environmental quality (SEQ) function (responsible for group level sustainability data preparation and external reporting). This function, with the auxiliary involvement of Group Finance and Group IT, sets BG's priorities on SER, so that business sites and areas give it due attention. The empirical research in question documented the stages a group went through on order to make SER auditable and functional across the entire core BG. The first step is to set up a proper information system, either an internally developed one or an external software solution, even one connected to an existing financial reporting platform. In the second stage, the Goup Finance is to develop specific accounting instructions to make data registration, processing and the whole SER reporting system auditable and aligned with the financial. These uniform instructions, however, may be considered unfit for some local contexts and not acknowledged by local SEQ staff (e.g., engineers). In these cases, despite the risk of losing the objectivity provided by accounting, Group SEQ opted to not control the intervention so meticulously, allowing local staff to follow their own locally adapted strategies to a certain extent. Third, social and environmental indicators, that are normally disconnected, should then be linked through financial accounting systems (based on double-entry bookkeeping, hence reliable) to ensure that data are reliable. Once defined, these indicators are disclosed in a CSR report on the website, as well as to governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, if required. Fourth, it should be arranged for Group SEQ to assist with the collection of data at sites and registration in the information system, and a standard for data documentation should be internally developed. Once these prerequisites are implemented, the internal control system, ensuring data completeness, can finally be established. For this purpose, the BG should experiment with MCSs, so as to find the most fitting system for its SER strategy. Controls can either be automated, thus built into the information system, or manual, meaning that the SEQ of the BG would perform some analytical procedures (e.g., performance review) to identify deviations between prior-and present-year data, then comment on the differences above 20% only. Alternatively, the BG may trust the assurance provider to design the control system [98].

(p20.3) CSR does not necessarily have to be limited to the group or network only. In fact, SME networks have great potential for increasing positive SD outcomes, especially when SMEs are embedded in the local territory. SMEs in these ethical territorial networks lead through their best practices and a collective vision the diffusion of CSR across the territory, known as territorial social responsibility (TSR). The focus of TSR is not only on shareholders but especially on the community (citizens and territory), which serves as both the main judge and beneficiary of socially responsible activities, such as improvements in the local quality of life and integration of economic events with socio-environmental considerations. TSR focuses on such important dimensions as participation, territorial identity, and the cultural CSR aspect (strategic and operative) for SD [101].

(p20.4) An example of this territorial approach to CSR is given by the implementation of the EMAS scheme, available to stand-alone firms, by a cluster (e.g., industrial districts, technological parks, other territorial agglomerations). This integration of environmental management at cluster level builds upon the co-opetition (cooperation among competing entities) between private companies and stakeholders located close to one another, as well as local governments. This can be considered a policy tool with a twofold purpose. On one hand, there is the pursuit of a more effective environmental performance within a certain jurisdiction (macro level), due to the narrowly focused traditional policy tools. On the other, environment managerial priorities that arise in SMEs also need to be taken into consideration (micro level), since they are simultaneously competing on a global issue for an opportunity to be globally recognized, despite the resource constraints. The transmission mechanism to the territorial area is guaranteed by the fact that SMEs in a cluster share suppliers, clients and similar environmental issues, and comply with the same legislations, thus making it possible for them to jointly come to solutions regarding their common territory, and exploit the resulting economies of scale (e.g., water purification systems used by all firms). The EMAS cluster approach, which is similar to the regional environmental management systems (REMS), is used for consolidating territorial, industrial and environmental policies in industrial clusters [72].
