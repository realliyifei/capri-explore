## (s0) Pulmonary epithelium
(p0.0) The airway epithelium is vital for its varied functions, such as warming and humidifying the inhaled air, clearing and defending the airways from inspired pathogens, and forming the epithelial half of the air-blood barrier. The most important point of SARS-COVID-2 entry is the respiratory tract, and epithelial cells are the most important targets of this virus. Therefore, it is necessary to review the various cell types in the respiratory epithelium ( Fig. 1).

(p0.1) A pseudostratified epithelium covers the upper airways, consisting of basal cells, ciliated cells as the main cell type, goblet cells, Clara or club cells, and a limited number of neuroendocrine cells [33,34]. Columnar ciliated cells have 200-300 individual cilia and are the main cell type in this epithelium. Their hair-like projections move backwards and forwards at a rapid frequency (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20) and help move mucus upwards through the tract. Goblet cells are also columnar, like ciliated cells. They produce and secrete mucin, a glycoprotein, into the airway for trapping inhaled particles and pathogens, also for and moisturizing the epithelium [33,35]. Clara or club cells are cube-shaped cells that secret proteins (e.g., CCSP) and surfactant proteins (SP)-A, SP-B, and SP-D. These proteins are involved in the composition of lung fluid [33,36].
## (s2) Endothelial cells
(p2.0) As shown in Fig. 2, endothelial cells ACE2 [20], transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [21], sialic acid receptors (a surface adhesion molecule) [22], extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (CD147, or basigin), TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 [23], and NRP1 [24] are all reportedly implicated in SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, it is reported that cathepsin B and L are also essential entry factors in COVID-19. L-SIGN is reportedly expressed in type II human alveolar cells, and pulmonary endothelial cells also mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry [67].

(p2.1) When the SARS-CoV-2 enters endothelial cells, it adversely affects these cells. Moreover, endothelial cells can be affected by molecules produced by other cells fighting against the virus. These molecules can bind to their receptors expressed on the endothelial cell surface. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is one molecule released by a variety of cell types and tissues, but the main source of PAF is leukocytes. PAF mediates the inflammation process. Platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) is thought to be formed on the cytoplasmic or nuclear membrane of various cells, in particular endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes. The PAF/PAFR complex in endothelial cells may induce increased vascular permeability, hypotension, and expression of cytokines such as CXCL1, interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IFN-γ [68,69].

(p2.2) TNF-α is another signaling molecule that may affect endothelial cells in COVID-19. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 strongly induces the secretion of TNF-α, which has an essential role in the pathology of acute lung injury. TNF signaling and the production of two TNF receptors (TNFRs, p55 and p75) on the pulmonary endothelium have not been clearly demonstrated in humans. One study reported that the two receptors, predominantly p55, are produced in pulmonary endothelial cells in mice. Reportedly, the administration of intravenous TNF led to surface expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 [70,71]. Moreover, studies have reported that TNF can affect cell-cell junctions. SARS-CoV-2 has many effects on cell junctions, especially in endothelial and epithelial cells. Adherens junctions are specific intercellular adhesive structures mainly formed by cadherin and nectin adhesion receptors. They are essential for organization and flexibility of cell-to-cell attachment. Adherens junctions in endothelial cells are complexes containing vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and nectins. There are many cytosolic partners that interact with them, such as α-and β-catenin for VEcadherin, and afadin for nectins [72,73]. TNF can inhibit the expression of VE-cadherin, and also increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin that blocks its binding with β-catenin, thus resulting in nonfunctional junctions [74,75]. Furthermore, TNF can affect actin cytoskeleton remodeling, VE-cadherin cytosolic domains, and β-catenin interactions. It has also been reported that TNF can induce caspase activation, which destroys intercellular junctions. In addition to cell junctions, members of the TNF family can activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway, resulting in increased proinflammatory gene transcription, cell proliferation, and differentiation [76,77].

(p2.3) Tight junctions between endothelial cells include transmembrane proteins such as MARVEL domain proteins, e.g., occludin, junctional adhesion molecules (jAMs), and claudins [66][67][68]; adaptor proteins; cytoskeletal linkers; and polarity proteins, e.g., zonula occludens (ZO1, ZO2, and ZO3) proteins and protein associated with Lin-1 1 (PALS1) [69][70][71]. Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is another component of the signaling pathway related to tight junctions [72].

(p2.4) Capillary leakage can occur in severe infections or in sepsis, due to disruption of tight junctions between endothelial cells. It has been suggested that hijacking of PALS1, a tight-junction-associated protein, by the SARS-CoV E protein has a central role in lung epithelial disruption in these patients [78]. Studies have reported that PALS1 is also expressed in endothelial cells. Researchers have proposed that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein can interact strongly with PALS1, thereby disrupting the epithelial barrier and leading to severe inflammation [79,80].
## (s3) Platelets
(p3.0) Studies have shown that coagulopathy is a common symptom in patients with severe COVID-19. This could be a result of excessive inflammation. Coagulopathy is characterized by dysregulated coagulation parameters, lower platelet count, increased microthrombi, elevated D-dimer, etc. It is reported that patients with COVID-19 who have lower platelet counts and disseminated intravascular coagulation have a poor prognosis and increased mortality [27,28]. In many viral infections, platelets can be activated, and are involved in inflammation and thrombotic processes. The low platelet level in some patients with COVID-19 could be due to increased consumption and thrombus formation by massively activated platelets [98,99].
## (s6) Role of DAMPs in SARS CoV-2-induced respiratory failure
(p6.0) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107]. The released histones can activate pro-factor VII activating protease (pro-FSAP) to produce factor VII activating protease (FSAP). FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p6.1) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation. Thrombin causes fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, which is amplified by factor XIII activation. Then, the soluble fibrin monomers interact with each other to produce a cross-linked network of long fibrin threads that trap the platelets. Then a spongy mass builds up, hardens, and contracts to form the final blood clot. The coagulation cascade is important both in normal circulatory conditions and in pathological reactions [152,153]. Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 

(p6.2) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107]. The released histones can activate pro-factor VII activating protease (pro-FSAP) to produce factor VII activating protease (FSAP). FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p6.3) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation. Thrombin causes fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, which is amplified by factor XIII activation. Then, the soluble fibrin monomers interact with each other to produce a cross-linked network of long fibrin threads that trap the platelets. Then a spongy mass builds up, hardens, and contracts to form the final blood clot. The coagulation cascade is important both in normal circulatory conditions and in pathological reactions [152,153]. Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 

(p6.4) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107]. The released histones can activate pro-factor VII activating protease (pro-FSAP) to produce factor VII activating protease (FSAP). FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p6.5) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation. Thrombin causes fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, which is amplified by factor XIII activation. Then, the soluble fibrin monomers interact with each other to produce a cross-linked network of long fibrin threads that trap the platelets. Then a spongy mass builds up, hardens, and contracts to form the final blood clot. The coagulation cascade is important both in normal circulatory conditions and in pathological reactions [152,153]. Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 
## (s7) The role of von Willebrand factor and granulocyte subsets in SARS CoV-2-induced respiratory failure
(p7.0) Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is another factor involved in SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy. It is secreted by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Increased vWF antigen concentrations in plasma have been measured in COVID-19 infections [155,156]. Reportedly, the increased concentration of vWF enhanced the adhesion of platelets onto the collagen surface, and increased the aggregation of platelets. vWF could be a therapeutic target in patients with thrombocytopenia [157]. On the basis of some studies, basophil and eosinophil counts, as well as granulocyte subsets, are altered in severe COVID-19 infection. These cells play a pivotal role in the antiviral response and immunopathology in COVID-19. Basophils are decreased during the acute phase, while the numbers recover during the COVID-19 recovery period. Basophils can enhance B-cell responses during the humoral immune response triggered by IL-4 or IL-6 production. Moreover, it has been shown that basophil count is significantly correlated with the concentration of IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 [157]. However, the level of IL-6 is inversely correlated with antibody production [158]. It was also reported that basophils can secrete IL-13 following activation, and IL-13 receptors are expressed on mature human B cells, so basophils may contribute to humoral immune responses and inflammatory allergic reactions [159].

(p7.1) Notch signaling is a juxtacrine signaling pathway, mediated by receptor-ligand interactions between neighboring cells. The notch signaling pathway is dysregulated in many pathological conditions, especially inflammation [160][161][162]. In experimental animal models, the pharmacological blocking of notch signaling has been reported to improve inflammatory conditions [163]. In vitro, it was shown that cytokines can affect notch signaling in basophils, and inhibition of this signaling pathway reduced basophil cytokine production. It was also reported that the notch signaling pathway is involved in the expression of cytokine genes in activated macrophages during inflammation [164]. Notch signaling is also important for peripheral T-cell differentiation and activation [165].

(p7.2) The overexpression of Jagged (a notch ligand) in professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) has been reported [166]. Although there is not enough evidence for basophils to function as antigen-presenting cells, it is known that B cells are APCs, and can activate T cells [167]. Moreover, basophils can enhance B-cell responses [158].

(p7.3) Because COVID-19 is an inflammatory disease, it may also affect the notch signaling pathway. As a result, basophil cytokine production and basophil-induced B-cell activity would be impaired, affecting both cellular and humeral immunity. This is still a hypothesis, and further studies are needed to confirm the role of the notch signaling pathway in COVID-19.

(p7.4) Eosinophils are another granulocyte subset that contribute to viral infections by producing NO, increasing TLR7, and can also produce eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs, similar to NETs) to limit viral replication [168]. It was also reported that eosinophils are involved in the immune response against rhinovirus infections by stimulating T cells [169]. NO is a major endogenous vasodilator that maintains blood pressure within the normal range and also blocks platelet activation [168,170]. It was reported that the increase in blood eosinophils found in patients with eosinophilic asthma exerted no protective influence on COVID-19 [171]. A variety of eosinophil functions in patients has been reported. Eosinophil EETosis and release of major basic protein (MBP) could contribute to coagulopathy, while in blood vessels, eosinophils could mediate platelet activation and thrombus formation [172]. It has been reported that activated eosinophils can secrete cytokines, such as IL-2 [172], IL-8 [173], IL-12 [174], INF λ [175], etc. Eosinophil degranulation occurs in inflammatory conditions and virus infections. The important components of eosinophil granules include eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) [176].

(p7.5) EDN can induce the activation of the dendritic cell TLR2-MyD88 signaling pathway in response to microbial and viral infections [176]. Both macrophages and DCs can secrete IL-12, IL-27, and IL-18. IL-18 has a significant role in ARDS [176][177][178]. IL-12 acts on activated NK and T cells expressing the IL-12 receptor. IL-12, IL-27, IL-15, IL-18, and type I IFN cal all increase the activity of NK cells and induce the expression of IFN-γ. IFN-γ can activate macrophages to destroy pathogens. Moreover, it was shown that IL-12 can trigger the differentiation of T-helper 1 cells. Pulmonary DCs also produce IL-6 at a significantly higher level than other DCs. Some studies have reported that IL-6 is the most important single cytokine in the cytokine storm seen in patients with COVID-19 [179][180][181].

(p7.6) ECP and EDN have both been reported to activate apoptotic pathways in infected cells. Moreover, ECP is strongly associated with tissue necrosis in different organs. In addition, higher concentrations of MBP and ECP occur in patients with eosinophilic asthma. They could contribute to many biological processes, such as the stimulation of perivascular mast cells (MCs) resulting in microvascular permeability [176,182].

(p7.7) Various proinflammatory cytokines are released in patients with COVID-19, especially IL-6. It has been reported that IL-6 is a pivotal mediator of lung damage. Mast cells (MCs) have been found to be important sources of IL-6, IL-1β, VEGF, and TNF, and they play a crucial role in several pulmonary diseases [183].

(p7.8) Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is another factor involved in SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy. It is secreted by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Increased vWF antigen concentrations in plasma have been measured in COVID-19 infections [155,156]. Reportedly, the increased concentration of vWF enhanced the adhesion of platelets onto the collagen surface, and increased the aggregation of platelets. vWF could be a therapeutic target in patients with thrombocytopenia [157].

Basophils are decreased during the acute phase, while the numbers recover during the COVID-19 recovery period. Basophils can enhance B-cell responses during the humoral immune response triggered by IL-4 or IL-6 production. Moreover, it has been shown that basophil count is significantly correlated with the concentration of IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 [157]. However, the level of IL-6 is inversely correlated with antibody production [158]. It was also reported that basophils can secrete IL-13 following activation, and IL-13 receptors are expressed on mature human B cells, so basophils may contribute to humoral immune responses and inflammatory allergic reactions [159].

(p7.9) Notch signaling is a juxtacrine signaling pathway, mediated by receptor-ligand interactions between neighboring cells. The notch signaling pathway is dysregulated in many pathological conditions, especially inflammation [160][161][162].

It was also reported that the notch signaling pathway is involved in the expression of cytokine genes in activated macrophages during inflammation [164]. Notch signaling is also important for peripheral T-cell differentiation and activation [165].

(p7.10) The overexpression of Jagged (a notch ligand) in professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) has been reported [166]. Although there is not enough evidence for basophils to function as antigen-presenting cells, it is known that B cells are APCs, and can activate T cells [167]. Moreover, basophils can enhance B-cell responses [158].

(p7.11) Because COVID-19 is an inflammatory disease, it may also affect the notch signaling pathway. As a result, basophil cytokine production and basophil-induced B-cell activity would be impaired, affecting both cellular and humeral immunity.

## (s14) Pulmonary epithelium
(p14.0) The airway epithelium is vital for its varied functions, such as warming and humidifying the inhaled air, clearing and defending the airways from inspired pathogens, and forming the epithelial half of the air-blood barrier. The most important point of SARS-COVID-2 entry is the respiratory tract, and epithelial cells are the most important targets of this virus. Therefore, it is necessary to review the various cell types in the respiratory epithelium ( Fig. 1).

(p14.1) A pseudostratified epithelium covers the upper airways, consisting of basal cells, ciliated cells as the main cell type, goblet cells, Clara or club cells, and a limited number of neuroendocrine cells [33,34]. Columnar ciliated cells have 200-300 individual cilia and are the main cell type in this epithelium. Their hair-like projections move backwards and forwards at a rapid frequency (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20) and help move mucus upwards through the tract. Goblet cells are also columnar, like ciliated cells. They produce and secrete mucin, a glycoprotein, into the airway for trapping inhaled particles and pathogens, also for and moisturizing the epithelium [33,35]. Clara or club cells are cube-shaped cells that secret proteins (e.g., CCSP) and surfactant proteins (SP)-A, SP-B, and SP-D. These proteins are involved in the composition of lung fluid [33,36].
## (s16) Endothelial cells
(p16.0) As shown in Fig. 2, endothelial cells ACE2 [20], transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [21], sialic acid receptors (a surface adhesion molecule) [22], extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (CD147, or basigin), TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 [23], and NRP1 [24] are all reportedly implicated in SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, it is reported that cathepsin B and L are also essential entry factors in COVID-19. L-SIGN is reportedly expressed in type II human alveolar cells, and pulmonary endothelial cells also mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry [67].

(p16.1) When the SARS-CoV-2 enters endothelial cells, it adversely affects these cells. Moreover, endothelial cells can be affected by molecules produced by other cells fighting against the virus. These molecules can bind to their receptors expressed on the endothelial cell surface. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is one molecule released by a variety of cell types and tissues, but the main source of PAF is leukocytes. PAF mediates the inflammation process. Platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) is thought to be formed on the cytoplasmic or nuclear membrane of various cells, in particular endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes. The PAF/PAFR complex in endothelial cells may induce increased vascular permeability, hypotension, and expression of cytokines such as CXCL1, interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IFN-γ [68,69].

(p16.2) TNF-α is another signaling molecule that may affect endothelial cells in COVID-19. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 strongly induces the secretion of TNF-α, which has an essential role in the pathology of acute lung injury. TNF signaling and the production of two TNF receptors (TNFRs, p55 and p75) on the pulmonary endothelium have not been clearly demonstrated in humans. One study reported that the two receptors, predominantly p55, are produced in pulmonary endothelial cells in mice. Reportedly, the administration of intravenous TNF led to surface expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 [70,71]. Moreover, studies have reported that TNF can affect cell-cell junctions. SARS-CoV-2 has many effects on cell junctions, especially in endothelial and epithelial cells. Adherens junctions are specific intercellular adhesive structures mainly formed by cadherin and nectin adhesion receptors. They are essential for organization and flexibility of cell-to-cell attachment. Adherens junctions in endothelial cells are complexes containing vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and nectins. There are many cytosolic partners that interact with them, such as α-and β-catenin for VEcadherin, and afadin for nectins [72,73]. TNF can inhibit the expression of VE-cadherin, and also increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin that blocks its binding with β-catenin, thus resulting in nonfunctional junctions [74,75]. Furthermore, TNF can affect actin cytoskeleton remodeling, VE-cadherin cytosolic domains, and β-catenin interactions. It has also been reported that TNF can induce caspase activation, which destroys intercellular junctions. In addition to cell junctions, members of the TNF family can activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway, resulting in increased proinflammatory gene transcription, cell proliferation, and differentiation [76,77].

(p16.3) Tight junctions between endothelial cells include transmembrane proteins such as MARVEL domain proteins, e.g., occludin, junctional adhesion molecules (jAMs), and claudins [66][67][68]; adaptor proteins; cytoskeletal linkers; and polarity proteins, e.g., zonula occludens (ZO1, ZO2, and ZO3) proteins and protein associated with Lin-1 1 (PALS1) [69][70][71]. Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is another component of the signaling pathway related to tight junctions [72].

(p16.4) Capillary leakage can occur in severe infections or in sepsis, due to disruption of tight junctions between endothelial cells. It has been suggested that hijacking of PALS1, a tight-junction-associated protein, by the SARS-CoV E protein has a central role in lung epithelial disruption in these patients [78]. Studies have reported that PALS1 is also expressed in endothelial cells. Researchers have proposed that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein can interact strongly with PALS1, thereby disrupting the epithelial barrier and leading to severe inflammation [79,80].
## (s17) Platelets
(p17.0) Studies have shown that coagulopathy is a common symptom in patients with severe COVID-19. This could be a result of excessive inflammation. Coagulopathy is characterized by dysregulated coagulation parameters, lower platelet count, increased microthrombi, elevated D-dimer, etc. It is reported that patients with COVID-19 who have lower platelet counts and disseminated intravascular coagulation have a poor prognosis and increased mortality [27,28]. In many viral infections, platelets can be activated, and are involved in inflammation and thrombotic processes. The low platelet level in some patients with COVID-19 could be due to increased consumption and thrombus formation by massively activated platelets [98,99].
## (s20) Role of DAMPs in SARS CoV-2-induced respiratory failure
(p20.0) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107]. The released histones can activate pro-factor VII activating protease (pro-FSAP) to produce factor VII activating protease (FSAP). FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p20.1) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation. Thrombin causes fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, which is amplified by factor XIII activation. Then, the soluble fibrin monomers interact with each other to produce a cross-linked network of long fibrin threads that trap the platelets. Then a spongy mass builds up, hardens, and contracts to form the final blood clot. The coagulation cascade is important both in normal circulatory conditions and in pathological reactions [152,153]. Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 

(p20.2) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107]. The released histones can activate pro-factor VII activating protease (pro-FSAP) to produce factor VII activating protease (FSAP). FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p20.3) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation. Thrombin causes fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, which is amplified by factor XIII activation. Then, the soluble fibrin monomers interact with each other to produce a cross-linked network of long fibrin threads that trap the platelets. Then a spongy mass builds up, hardens, and contracts to form the final blood clot. The coagulation cascade is important both in normal circulatory conditions and in pathological reactions [152,153]. Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 

(p20.4) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107].

FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p20.5) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation. Thrombin causes fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, which is amplified by factor XIII activation. Then, the soluble fibrin monomers interact with each other to produce a cross-linked network of long fibrin threads that trap the platelets. Then a spongy mass builds up, hardens, and contracts to form the final blood clot. The coagulation cascade is important both in normal circulatory conditions and in pathological reactions [152,153]. Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 
## (s21) The role of von Willebrand factor and granulocyte subsets in SARS CoV-2-induced respiratory failure
(p21.0) Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is another factor involved in SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy. It is secreted by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Increased vWF antigen concentrations in plasma have been measured in COVID-19 infections [155,156]. Reportedly, the increased concentration of vWF enhanced the adhesion of platelets onto the collagen surface, and increased the aggregation of platelets. vWF could be a therapeutic target in patients with thrombocytopenia [157]. On the basis of some studies, basophil and eosinophil counts, as well as granulocyte subsets, are altered in severe COVID-19 infection. These cells play a pivotal role in the antiviral response and immunopathology in COVID-19. Basophils are decreased during the acute phase, while the numbers recover during the COVID-19 recovery period. Basophils can enhance B-cell responses during the humoral immune response triggered by IL-4 or IL-6 production. Moreover, it has been shown that basophil count is significantly correlated with the concentration of IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 [157]. However, the level of IL-6 is inversely correlated with antibody production [158]. It was also reported that basophils can secrete IL-13 following activation, and IL-13 receptors are expressed on mature human B cells, so basophils may contribute to humoral immune responses and inflammatory allergic reactions [159].

(p21.1) Notch signaling is a juxtacrine signaling pathway, mediated by receptor-ligand interactions between neighboring cells. The notch signaling pathway is dysregulated in many pathological conditions, especially inflammation [160][161][162]. In experimental animal models, the pharmacological blocking of notch signaling has been reported to improve inflammatory conditions [163]. In vitro, it was shown that cytokines can affect notch signaling in basophils, and inhibition of this signaling pathway reduced basophil cytokine production. It was also reported that the notch signaling pathway is involved in the expression of cytokine genes in activated macrophages during inflammation [164]. Notch signaling is also important for peripheral T-cell differentiation and activation [165].

(p21.2) The overexpression of Jagged (a notch ligand) in professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) has been reported [166]. Although there is not enough evidence for basophils to function as antigen-presenting cells, it is known that B cells are APCs, and can activate T cells [167]. Moreover, basophils can enhance B-cell responses [158].

(p21.3) Because COVID-19 is an inflammatory disease, it may also affect the notch signaling pathway. As a result, basophil cytokine production and basophil-induced B-cell activity would be impaired, affecting both cellular and humeral immunity. This is still a hypothesis, and further studies are needed to confirm the role of the notch signaling pathway in COVID-19.

(p21.4) Eosinophils are another granulocyte subset that contribute to viral infections by producing NO, increasing TLR7, and can also produce eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs, similar to NETs) to limit viral replication [168]. It was also reported that eosinophils are involved in the immune response against rhinovirus infections by stimulating T cells [169]. NO is a major endogenous vasodilator that maintains blood pressure within the normal range and also blocks platelet activation [168,170]. It was reported that the increase in blood eosinophils found in patients with eosinophilic asthma exerted no protective influence on COVID-19 [171]. A variety of eosinophil functions in patients has been reported. Eosinophil EETosis and release of major basic protein (MBP) could contribute to coagulopathy, while in blood vessels, eosinophils could mediate platelet activation and thrombus formation [172]. It has been reported that activated eosinophils can secrete cytokines, such as IL-2 [172], IL-8 [173], IL-12 [174], INF λ [175], etc. Eosinophil degranulation occurs in inflammatory conditions and virus infections. The important components of eosinophil granules include eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) [176].

(p21.5) EDN can induce the activation of the dendritic cell TLR2-MyD88 signaling pathway in response to microbial and viral infections [176]. Both macrophages and DCs can secrete IL-12, IL-27, and IL-18. IL-18 has a significant role in ARDS [176][177][178]. IL-12 acts on activated NK and T cells expressing the IL-12 receptor. IL-12, IL-27, IL-15, IL-18, and type I IFN cal all increase the activity of NK cells and induce the expression of IFN-γ. IFN-γ can activate macrophages to destroy pathogens. Moreover, it was shown that IL-12 can trigger the differentiation of T-helper 1 cells. Pulmonary DCs also produce IL-6 at a significantly higher level than other DCs. Some studies have reported that IL-6 is the most important single cytokine in the cytokine storm seen in patients with COVID-19 [179][180][181].

(p21.6) ECP and EDN have both been reported to activate apoptotic pathways in infected cells. Moreover, ECP is strongly associated with tissue necrosis in different organs. In addition, higher concentrations of MBP and ECP occur in patients with eosinophilic asthma. They could contribute to many biological processes, such as the stimulation of perivascular mast cells (MCs) resulting in microvascular permeability [176,182].

(p21.7) Various proinflammatory cytokines are released in patients with COVID-19, especially IL-6. It has been reported that IL-6 is a pivotal mediator of lung damage. Mast cells (MCs) have been found to be important sources of IL-6, IL-1β, VEGF, and TNF, and they play a crucial role in several pulmonary diseases [183].

(p21.8) Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is another factor involved in SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy. It is secreted by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Increased vWF antigen concentrations in plasma have been measured in COVID-19 infections [155,156].

## (s28) Pulmonary epithelium
(p28.0) The airway epithelium is vital for its varied functions, such as warming and humidifying the inhaled air, clearing and defending the airways from inspired pathogens, and forming the epithelial half of the air-blood barrier. The most important point of SARS-COVID-2 entry is the respiratory tract, and epithelial cells are the most important targets of this virus. Therefore, it is necessary to review the various cell types in the respiratory epithelium ( Fig. 1).

(p28.1) A pseudostratified epithelium covers the upper airways, consisting of basal cells, ciliated cells as the main cell type, goblet cells, Clara or club cells, and a limited number of neuroendocrine cells [33,34]. Columnar ciliated cells have 200-300 individual cilia and are the main cell type in this epithelium. Their hair-like projections move backwards and forwards at a rapid frequency (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20) and help move mucus upwards through the tract. Goblet cells are also columnar, like ciliated cells. They produce and secrete mucin, a glycoprotein, into the airway for trapping inhaled particles and pathogens, also for and moisturizing the epithelium [33,35]. Clara or club cells are cube-shaped cells that secret proteins (e.g., CCSP) and surfactant proteins (SP)-A, SP-B, and SP-D. These proteins are involved in the composition of lung fluid [33,36].
## (s30) Endothelial cells
(p30.0) As shown in Fig. 2, endothelial cells ACE2 [20], transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [21], sialic acid receptors (a surface adhesion molecule) [22], extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (CD147, or basigin), TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 [23], and NRP1 [24] are all reportedly implicated in SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, it is reported that cathepsin B and L are also essential entry factors in COVID-19. L-SIGN is reportedly expressed in type II human alveolar cells, and pulmonary endothelial cells also mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry [67].

(p30.1) When the SARS-CoV-2 enters endothelial cells, it adversely affects these cells. Moreover, endothelial cells can be affected by molecules produced by other cells fighting against the virus. These molecules can bind to their receptors expressed on the endothelial cell surface. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is one molecule released by a variety of cell types and tissues, but the main source of PAF is leukocytes. PAF mediates the inflammation process. Platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) is thought to be formed on the cytoplasmic or nuclear membrane of various cells, in particular endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes. The PAF/PAFR complex in endothelial cells may induce increased vascular permeability, hypotension, and expression of cytokines such as CXCL1, interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IFN-γ [68,69].

(p30.2) TNF-α is another signaling molecule that may affect endothelial cells in COVID-19. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 strongly induces the secretion of TNF-α, which has an essential role in the pathology of acute lung injury. TNF signaling and the production of two TNF receptors (TNFRs, p55 and p75) on the pulmonary endothelium have not been clearly demonstrated in humans. One study reported that the two receptors, predominantly p55, are produced in pulmonary endothelial cells in mice. Reportedly, the administration of intravenous TNF led to surface expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 [70,71]. Moreover, studies have reported that TNF can affect cell-cell junctions. SARS-CoV-2 has many effects on cell junctions, especially in endothelial and epithelial cells. Adherens junctions are specific intercellular adhesive structures mainly formed by cadherin and nectin adhesion receptors. They are essential for organization and flexibility of cell-to-cell attachment. Adherens junctions in endothelial cells are complexes containing vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and nectins. There are many cytosolic partners that interact with them, such as α-and β-catenin for VEcadherin, and afadin for nectins [72,73]. TNF can inhibit the expression of VE-cadherin, and also increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin that blocks its binding with β-catenin, thus resulting in nonfunctional junctions [74,75]. Furthermore, TNF can affect actin cytoskeleton remodeling, VE-cadherin cytosolic domains, and β-catenin interactions. It has also been reported that TNF can induce caspase activation, which destroys intercellular junctions. In addition to cell junctions, members of the TNF family can activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway, resulting in increased proinflammatory gene transcription, cell proliferation, and differentiation [76,77].

(p30.3) Tight junctions between endothelial cells include transmembrane proteins such as MARVEL domain proteins, e.g., occludin, junctional adhesion molecules (jAMs), and claudins [66][67][68]; adaptor proteins; cytoskeletal linkers; and polarity proteins, e.g., zonula occludens (ZO1, ZO2, and ZO3) proteins and protein associated with Lin-1 1 (PALS1) [69][70][71]. Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is another component of the signaling pathway related to tight junctions [72].

(p30.4) Capillary leakage can occur in severe infections or in sepsis, due to disruption of tight junctions between endothelial cells. It has been suggested that hijacking of PALS1, a tight-junction-associated protein, by the SARS-CoV E protein has a central role in lung epithelial disruption in these patients [78]. Studies have reported that PALS1 is also expressed in endothelial cells. Researchers have proposed that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein can interact strongly with PALS1, thereby disrupting the epithelial barrier and leading to severe inflammation [79,80].
## (s31) Platelets
(p31.0) Studies have shown that coagulopathy is a common symptom in patients with severe COVID-19. This could be a result of excessive inflammation. Coagulopathy is characterized by dysregulated coagulation parameters, lower platelet count, increased microthrombi, elevated D-dimer, etc. It is reported that patients with COVID-19 who have lower platelet counts and disseminated intravascular coagulation have a poor prognosis and increased mortality [27,28]. In many viral infections, platelets can be activated, and are involved in inflammation and thrombotic processes. The low platelet level in some patients with COVID-19 could be due to increased consumption and thrombus formation by massively activated platelets [98,99].
## (s34) Role of DAMPs in SARS CoV-2-induced respiratory failure
(p34.0) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107]. The released histones can activate pro-factor VII activating protease (pro-FSAP) to produce factor VII activating protease (FSAP). FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p34.1) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation. Thrombin causes fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, which is amplified by factor XIII activation. Then, the soluble fibrin monomers interact with each other to produce a cross-linked network of long fibrin threads that trap the platelets. Then a spongy mass builds up, hardens, and contracts to form the final blood clot. The coagulation cascade is important both in normal circulatory conditions and in pathological reactions [152,153]. Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 

(p34.2) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107]. The released histones can activate pro-factor VII activating protease (pro-FSAP) to produce factor VII activating protease (FSAP). FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p34.3) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation.

Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 

(p34.4) Widespread endothelial dysfunction caused by direct viral infection or immune response results in the secretion of numerous cytokines and DAMPs. DAMPs can directly induce NETosis following influenza virus infection [150,151]. NETs are made up of DNA, histones, and enzymes such as serine proteases [106,107]. The released histones can activate pro-factor VII activating protease (pro-FSAP) to produce factor VII activating protease (FSAP). FSAP contributes to the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades, by indirectly mediating plasminogen activation. Interestingly FSAP can also degrade histones [152].

(p34.5) NETs can also stimulate FXII activation, and FXIIa is able to directly convert prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key factor in coagulation. Thrombin causes fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, which is amplified by factor XIII activation. Then, the soluble fibrin monomers interact with each other to produce a cross-linked network of long fibrin threads that trap the platelets. Then a spongy mass builds up, hardens, and contracts to form the final blood clot. The coagulation cascade is important both in normal circulatory conditions and in pathological reactions [152,153]. Moreover, NET serine proteases and histones may also play a role in platelet activation [106,154,155]. 
## (s35) The role of von Willebrand factor and granulocyte subsets in SARS CoV-2-induced respiratory failure
(p35.0) Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is another factor involved in SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy. It is secreted by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Increased vWF antigen concentrations in plasma have been measured in COVID-19 infections [155,156]. Reportedly, the increased concentration of vWF enhanced the adhesion of platelets onto the collagen surface, and increased the aggregation of platelets. vWF could be a therapeutic target in patients with thrombocytopenia [157]. On the basis of some studies, basophil and eosinophil counts, as well as granulocyte subsets, are altered in severe COVID-19 infection. These cells play a pivotal role in the antiviral response and immunopathology in COVID-19. Basophils are decreased during the acute phase, while the numbers recover during the COVID-19 recovery period. Basophils can enhance B-cell responses during the humoral immune response triggered by IL-4 or IL-6 production. Moreover, it has been shown that basophil count is significantly correlated with the concentration of IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 [157]. However, the level of IL-6 is inversely correlated with antibody production [158]. It was also reported that basophils can secrete IL-13 following activation, and IL-13 receptors are expressed on mature human B cells, so basophils may contribute to humoral immune responses and inflammatory allergic reactions [159].

(p35.1) Notch signaling is a juxtacrine signaling pathway, mediated by receptor-ligand interactions between neighboring cells. The notch signaling pathway is dysregulated in many pathological conditions, especially inflammation [160][161][162]. In experimental animal models, the pharmacological blocking of notch signaling has been reported to improve inflammatory conditions [163]. In vitro, it was shown that cytokines can affect notch signaling in basophils, and inhibition of this signaling pathway reduced basophil cytokine production. It was also reported that the notch signaling pathway is involved in the expression of cytokine genes in activated macrophages during inflammation [164]. Notch signaling is also important for peripheral T-cell differentiation and activation [165].

(p35.2) The overexpression of Jagged (a notch ligand) in professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) has been reported [166]. Although there is not enough evidence for basophils to function as antigen-presenting cells, it is known that B cells are APCs, and can activate T cells [167]. Moreover, basophils can enhance B-cell responses [158].

(p35.3) Because COVID-19 is an inflammatory disease, it may also affect the notch signaling pathway. As a result, basophil cytokine production and basophil-induced B-cell activity would be impaired, affecting both cellular and humeral immunity. This is still a hypothesis, and further studies are needed to confirm the role of the notch signaling pathway in COVID-19.

(p35.4) Eosinophils are another granulocyte subset that contribute to viral infections by producing NO, increasing TLR7, and can also produce eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs, similar to NETs) to limit viral replication [168]. It was also reported that eosinophils are involved in the immune response against rhinovirus infections by stimulating T cells [169]. NO is a major endogenous vasodilator that maintains blood pressure within the normal range and also blocks platelet activation [168,170]. It was reported that the increase in blood eosinophils found in patients with eosinophilic asthma exerted no protective influence on COVID-19 [171]. A variety of eosinophil functions in patients has been reported. Eosinophil EETosis and release of major basic protein (MBP) could contribute to coagulopathy, while in blood vessels, eosinophils could mediate platelet activation and thrombus formation [172]. It has been reported that activated eosinophils can secrete cytokines, such as IL-2 [172], IL-8 [173], IL-12 [174], INF λ [175], etc. Eosinophil degranulation occurs in inflammatory conditions and virus infections. The important components of eosinophil granules include eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) [176].

(p35.5) EDN can induce the activation of the dendritic cell TLR2-MyD88 signaling pathway in response to microbial and viral infections [176]. Both macrophages and DCs can secrete IL-12, IL-27, and IL-18. IL-18 has a significant role in ARDS [176][177][178]. IL-12 acts on activated NK and T cells expressing the IL-12 receptor. IL-12, IL-27, IL-15, IL-18, and type I IFN cal all increase the activity of NK cells and induce the expression of IFN-γ. IFN-γ can activate macrophages to destroy pathogens. Moreover, it was shown that IL-12 can trigger the differentiation of T-helper 1 cells. Pulmonary DCs also produce IL-6 at a significantly higher level than other DCs. Some studies have reported that IL-6 is the most important single cytokine in the cytokine storm seen in patients with COVID-19 [179][180][181].

(p35.6) ECP and EDN have both been reported to activate apoptotic pathways in infected cells. Moreover, ECP is strongly associated with tissue necrosis in different organs. In addition, higher concentrations of MBP and ECP occur in patients with eosinophilic asthma. They could contribute to many biological processes, such as the stimulation of perivascular mast cells (MCs) resulting in microvascular permeability [176,182].

(p35.7) Various proinflammatory cytokines are released in patients with COVID-19, especially IL-6. It has been reported that IL-6 is a pivotal mediator of lung damage. Mast cells (MCs) have been found to be important sources of IL-6, IL-1β, VEGF, and TNF, and they play a crucial role in several pulmonary diseases [183].

(p35.8) Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is another factor involved in SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy. It is secreted by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes.
