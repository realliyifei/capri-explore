## (s1) Toxicity Assessment of Nanomaterials
(p1.0) The interface between toxicology and nanomaterials has led to the emergence of a sub-discipline, namely nanotoxicology, to better reflect the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials [32]. Therefore, from the biomedical perspective, nanotoxicology refers to the biological effects caused by the specific characteristics of nanomaterials. Additionally, toxicity assessments of nanomaterials should follow a standardized set of rules [33] to avoid confusion and misconduct in designing nanomaterials for biomedical applications. Generally, the direction for toxicity assessment subsequently involves the characterization of nanomaterials, in vitro and in vivo studies, and final clinical trials.
## (s4) In Vivo Studies
(p4.0) In vivo experiments are mandatory for investigating the neurotoxicity of nanomaterials because they allow for whole organ systems studies, which cannot be modeled in vitro [57]. Additionally, in vivo models are used to determine the unintentional brain uptake and the potential toxic effects of nanomaterials designed for the therapy of peripheric diseases.

(p4.1) Several in vivo models and techniques have been employed to assess the brain uptake of nanomaterials. Since the blood-brain barrier is relatively similar in all animals, with species-specific differences [58], the most common in vivo models include drosophila, zebrafish, rodent, canine, and non-human primate models. Moreover, the techniques for studying the brain uptake of drugs are categorized into invasive techniques, specifically in situ brain perfusion, intravenous injection, microdialysis, brain uptake index, cerebrospinal fluid sampling, blood/plasma ratio determination, and quantitative autoradiography, as well as non-invasive techniques, mostly involving imaging techniques [59].
## (s5) Neurotoxicity of Nanomaterials
(p5.0) Neurotoxicity refers to any reversible or irreversible adverse effect on the structure, function, or chemistry of the nervous system, during development or at maturity, produced by physical or chemical causes. Moreover, an adverse effect represents any change caused by treatment administration that affects the normal function. Common neurological adverse effects ( Figure 2) regarding morphological changes involve neuronopathy, axonopathy, myelinopathy, and gliopathy [61]. The main mechanisms for neurotoxicity involve the excessive production of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress, the release of cytokines causing neuroinflammation, and dysregulations of apoptosis leading to neuronal death [62]. However, there is a considerable lack of information regarding the neurotoxicity of nanomaterials, which complicates risk assessments following exposure. Therefore, the development of rapid, accurate, and effective strategies for determining the neurotoxic effects induced by nanomaterials is crucial [63]. categorized into invasive techniques, specifically in situ brain perfusion, intravenous injection, microdialysis, brain uptake index, cerebrospinal fluid sampling, blood/plasma ratio determination, and quantitative autoradiography, as well as non-invasive techniques, mostly involving imaging techniques [59].

## (s14) Inorganic Nanoparticles
(p14.0) Recent studies have proved the capacity of inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold, silver, iron oxide, titanium oxide, and silica nanoparticles, to translocate into the brain after entering the body. Furthermore, due to their limited excretion, they gradually accumulate in the brain, causing damage to neuronal cells and function impairments [86].
