## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Surfactin was first identified as a secondary metabolite in the culture supernatant of Bacillus subtilis in 1968 [1], and it remains one of the most effective biosurfactants based on its ability to reduce surface tension.It is mainly produced by Gram-positive Bacillus spp.[2][3][4][5].Surfactin has a lipopeptide structure consisting of: two acidic amino acid residues (L-glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid), five non-polar amino acid residues (L-leucine, D-leucine, L-valine, D-leucine, and L-leucine), and a 12-19-carbon b-hydroxy fatty acid chain [6].It is synthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) via a multi-carrier sulfur template mechanism [7,8].Surfactin has received extensive attention because of its: excellent surface activity, antimicrobial properties, outstanding biodegradability, and a variety of notable biological activities [9][10][11].Surfactin has high market value and broad application prospects in various industrial fields, such as: oil extraction, bioremediation, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, food, and household chemicals [12,13].However, because of the high production costs and low yields of known production strains, the industrial manufacture and commercial applications of surfactin remain elusive [14].

(p0.1) To meet the increasing demand for surfactin, considerable efforts have been made in recent years.Many studies focused on enhancing surfactin biosynthesis through various methods, including traditional approaches such as optimizing the nutrient supply and culture conditions of microbial sources, through which the: yield, composition, and biological activity of surfactin have been greatly improved [15][16][17].However, many factors of the surfactin biosynthesis mechanism are unknown, hampering further improvement and industrialization.Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of this mechanism at the systems biotechnology level, especially analyses of the pathways and enzymes involved in surfactin synthesis, is crucial for achieving the commercial application of surfactin.

(p0.2) This paper reviews the important enzymes of the three biosynthetic pathways of: surfactin, branchedchain amino acids, and branched-chain fatty acids.We further review the production of surfactin to illustrate the current research progress regarding its efficient synthesis based on different substrates, thereby facilitating a more in-depth understanding of the biological and molecular mechanisms of surfactin biosynthesis.synthesis of surfactin are presented in Supplementary Tables 1-4.

(p0.3) Surfactin is biosynthesized by the surfactin synthase SrfA, which is regulated by quorum sensing signals and the phosphopantetheine transferase Sfp.Numerous studies have aimed to improve the activity of SrfA and promote the production of surfactin [8].SrfA is composed of four subunits, namely: SrfAA, SrfAB, SrfAC, and SrfAD [18,19].SrfAA and SrfAB assemble the first six amino acids, and the extension of the initial product is catalyzed by a set of simultaneous thioester bond cleavage and transpeptidation reactions.SrfAC controls the assembly of the seventh amino acid, and it includes the first thioesterase domain that terminates the peptide chain extension and releases the resulting lipopeptide intermediate.SrfAD contains a second thioesterase/acyltransferase domain that activates the peptide chain.In addition, the NRPS multi-enzyme complex domains (including the: adenylation, peptide carrier protein, condensation, and thioesterase domains) are important for the biosynthesis of surfactin and enhancement of enzymatic activity [20].NRPS can be modified to synthesize novel surfactin analogs, and the engineering of NRPS has become a focus of research in related fields [21].Chooi et al. [22] indicated that the initial condensation domain of SrfAA is important for the structural modification of fatty acyl.However, no modification of the further condensation domain has been reported.Many reported engineering attempts resulted in chimeric enzymes with low product yields or even a complete loss of activity.The complexity of the NRPS structure, integrity of the modules, and diversity of link regions complicate genetic manipulation.Numerous unexpected modifications and low yields of peptide products need to be overcome.
## (s1) Enhancement of surfactin synthesis under different culture conditions
(p1.0) Strategies for improving the biosynthesis of surfactin are presented in Figure 2. Surfactin productivity is related to cell growth in Bacillus spp.Various culture conditions (e.g.pH, temperature, vibration speed) have been described in detail in literature to affect surfactin production by influencing cell growth [3,34].In addition, optimization of substances added to the medium (carbon sources, precursors, and other promoters) is one of the most common and effective strategies for promoting surfactin production (Table 1).
## (s4) Addition of xylose mixture as substrate
(p4.0) The production of surfactin is characterized by a high substrate cost, and effective strategies for reducing the production cost have always represented a key focus in the field of surfactin production.Surfactin production is usually based on sucrose, glucose, or glycerol as the carbon source [66].Agricultural waste biomass is one of the most abundant and inexpensive renewable resources, among which xylose, as the main product of lignocellulose hydrolysis, is the most abundant sugar in nature after glucose.The development of cheaper carbon sources can reduce costs, avoid the unnecessary generation of environmentally harmful waste components, and result in a sustainable industrial process.
## (s5) Addition of xylose as a single substrate
(p5.0) At present, there are few reports on surfactin production by Bacillus strains using xylose as a single carbon source.Khan et al. [46] studied surfactin production via submerged fermentation in a xylose medium, and the highest yield of surfactin reached 2.7 g/L, representing a 2.85-fold increase compared to no xylose addition.Bartal et al. [47] found that in xylose addition increased surfactin production in the C 15 variant by more than 11% compared to the findings for no xylose addition.
## (s9) Addition of nanoparticles to the culture medium
(p9.0) In addition to nutrients and buffers, there has been extensive research on the use of nanoparticles composed of iron, silver, or iron oxide to increase and improve the production of biosurfactants [77,78].

(p9.1) Recently, Fe nanoparticles (FeNPs) have been extensively applied because of their superior magnetic properties and perfect biocompatibility [79].Modabber et al. [48] studied the effects of starch-coated Fe 3þ nanoparticles on the biomass and surfactin production of B. subtilis.In a 5-L bioreactor, medium containing Fe 3þ nanoparticles resulted in greater biomass and surfactin production (6.02 g/L) as well as correspondingly lower surface tension (10.30mN/m), indicating that Fe 3þ

(p9.2) nanoparticles have a positive effect on biosurfactant production.Yang et al. [49] used FeNPs to increase the production of surfactin by enhancing its secretion.The addition of 5 g/L FeNPs to shake flasks and 7-L bioreactors increased the yield of surfactin to 7.15 and 9.18 g/L, respectively, representing increases of 45 and 54.5%, respectively.Meanwhile, transcriptomic analysis confirmed the effect of FeNPs on gene expression in B. amyloliquefaciens MT45.These works provided an effective strategy to increase surfactin production that can be applied to other metabolites, especially biosurfactants.The results illustrated that FeNPs have a positive effect on surfactin production not both shake flasks and large-scale applications.This will promote the industrial application of FeNPs in surfactin production.
## (s13) Enhancing the expression of surfactin export proteins
(p13.0) Enhancing the expression of surfactin export proteins is also an effective method for increasing surfactin production.Tsuge et al. [98] indicated that the production and resistance of surfactin can be mediated by protein transporters.Li et al. [88] further confirmed the hypothesis that proton motive force (PMF)-dependent transmembrane export can promote the efflux of surfactin in B. subtilis.For example, three putative lipopeptide transporters (KrsE, YcxA, and YerP) dependent on the PMF were overexpressed, and the production of surfactin was significantly increased by 52, 89, and 145%, respectively [7].The liaIHGFSR operon related to daptomycin resistance is also considered to participate in surfactin resistance.Zhi et al. [8] simultaneously overexpressed the SwrC, AcrB, and LiaIHGFSR proteins, which significantly increased the production of surfactin to 3.8 g/L, representing a 1.2-fold increase versus that of the original strain B. subtilis 168S7.These findings are consistent with the high-level expression of these proteins in the high surfactin-producing strain B.
## (s14) Increasing the expression of srfA to enhance surfactin biosynthesis
(p14.0) The typical factors affecting the expression of srfA are presented in Figure 3. Surfactin biosynthesis requires the key gene srfA, which is a 27-kb large operon controlled by the P srf promoter.Because it is difficult to express srfA heterologously, promoter exchange is an effective and preferred approach to increase surfactin production.For example, B. subtilis was designed to increase the production of surfactin mainly through promoter exchange of the srfA operon [89,90].To establish a high-yield surfactin production strain through promoter engineering, the transcriptome and production capacity of the strain need to be analyzed first.Jiao et al. [14] confirmed the weakness of the natural P srfA promoter through transcriptome analysis.Subsequently, the super-strong chimeric promoter P g3 was developed to drive the synthesis of surfactin.The production of surfactin in shake flasks reached 8.61 g/L, representing a 15.6-fold increase versus the wild-type strain B. subtilis THY-7.Cheng et al. [91] found that the promoter P 10 was stronger than P srfA concerning the expression of GFP and that P 10 could be used for autoinducible overexpression systems of heterologous proteins.However, it is necessary to explore effective promoters to enhance surfactin production, as the targeted construction of SrfA expression promoters for each strain may be more suitable.The number of uncertainties regarding the genetic components of wild-type strains greatly increases the difficulty of promoter engineering.
## (s16) Heterologous biosynthesis of surfactin
(p16.0) Heterologous expression of genes involved in the surfactin biosynthesis pathway has been challenging because of the large size of the srfA operon and the complex biosynthetic regulation by quorum sensing.

(p16.1) Wild-type B. subtilis 168 cannot synthesize surfactin because there is a stop codon in sfp, which plays an important part in surfactin synthesis.Wang et al. [87] integrated the complete sfp in B. subtilis 168, and the surfactin yield of the recombinant strain reached 0.45 g/L.
## (s17) Construction of high-quality artificial cells with xylose-transformed surfactin
(p17.0) A new research direction in the future is the use of synthetic biotechnology and metabolic engineering to improve the ability of genetically engineered strains to surfactin from xylose as the sole carbon source [130].The conversion efficiency of surfactin produced from xylose is low.The pathway by which xylose is channeled into the surfactin pathway in Bacillus spp. is presented in Figure 4.The utilization of xylose is limited by the production performance of strains and enzymes, and the inhibition of AraE by the AraR protein is associated with poor growth of B. subtilis 168 when xylose is used as the single carbon source [131].Recombinant B. subtilis 168 prefers to a medium rich in glucose to produce surfactin [74].However, Hu et al. [42] found that B. subtilis 168 could effectively use xylose when associated with an organic nitrogen source to eliminate the inhibition of AraE by AraR.The recombinant strain BSFX022 produced 2.203 g/L surfactin from xylose.Meanwhile, the reduction in the yield of organic acids by-products (such as acetate and lactate) with xylose as a carbon source enables the effective production of surfactin (up to 2.074 g/L) in a non-buffered system.

(p17.1) In view of the aforementioned reports on the synthesis of surfactin using xylose as the sole carbon source, there were some deficiencies, such as the complex and rigorous CCR mechanism of B. subtilis and the insufficient metabolic regulation of xylose utilization strains.A new research direction is the use of synthetic biotechnology combined with classical metabolic engineering, which has gradually enhanced xylose metabolism in the host and improved the ability of the strain to produce surfactin.Applying synthetic biology design principles (learn, design, build, and test), the pathway "optimization" approach is established through global transcriptome optimization of target bacterial gene clusters, combining: optimized libraries of promoters, RBSs, coding sequences, terminators, and other pathway elements in a metabolic engineering context, as well as screening for the highest level of microbial strains in the combined library by high-throughput techniques [132].

(p17.2) It has been reported that Caulobacter crescentus can effectively metabolize xylose, and many studies have heterologously expressed its related enzymes (including NAD þ -dependent xylose dehydrogenase and xylolactonase) [133] in other microorganisms to establish a new xylose utilization pathway.Related approaches include evolutionary engineering, which identified mutations conducive to the growth of B. subtilis on xylose.These mutations relieved the inhibition by AraR and produced recombinant B. subtilis that can grow rapidly using xylose.The strain design moved from random to rational/semi-rational to improve the efficiency of xylose transformation.Promoting the microbial xylose transport system by: strengthening the expression of the transporter AraE, engineering homologous or heterologous transporters, and screening xylose-specific transporters, can also greatly improve xylose utilization.Combined with the research on reverse metabolic engineering: the relevant endogenous metabolic nodes can be excavated, high-quality artificial cells can be established, and xylose metabolism in genetically engineered B. subtilis, can be improved.In short, synthetic biology will enable the development of new strategies to produce surfactin from xylose, thereby providing an alternative for inexpensive industrial production.
