## (s6) Helianthus annuus
(p6.0) The bacterium can increase plant biomass and accumulation of trace elements like Cu, Ni and Zn in the roots and shoot systems along with their mobilizing potential Rajkumar et al. (2008) Bacillus sp., Paenibacillus sp.
## (s7) Oryzae sativa
(p7.0) The bacterium can promote the root and shoot growth Beneduzi et al. (2008) ecological cost (Scherr and McNeely, 2008) and thereby contribute global pollution, unfavorable climate change, and loss of biodiversity.An ideal agricultural system is economically and spiritually beneficial to both producers and consumers including human beings.It should actively preserve and protect the environment, self-contained and regenerative, and produce enough food for an increased world population.An ideal agricultural system needs proper care on certain issues such as nutrient management, efficient utilization and recycling of energy, and preservation of natural resources and environment.
## (s8) Nutrient Management
(p8.0) Nutrient management is the science related with optimal utilization of soil, weather, hydraulic factors, and essential NPK inputs (Miao et al., 2011) with diverse cultural and physical conservation strategies that directly or indirectly helps in optimization of exploitation in nutrient use efficiency improving plant quality as well as soil health and environment.Plants generally absorb nutrients directly from soil through the rhizosphere and from the atmosphere through phyllosphere (Turner et al., 2013).Compounds released through different parts of the plant root system may create a special environment in the rhizosphere.These compounds are collectively termed as root exudates that generally belong to three main classes such as lowmolecular weight, high-molecular weight, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Ortiz-Castro et al., 2009).Low-molecular weight compounds represent the main portion of root exudates and consist of sugars, amino acids, organic acids, phenolics, vitamins, and various secondary metabolites.High-molecular weight compounds consist of mucilage and proteins, whereas CO 2 , certain secondary metabolites, alcohols, and aldehydes constitute volatiles.Several factors such as temperature, light, age, and soil type can affect the nature and timing of root exudation (Badri and Vivanco, 2009).In plants grown under low phosphate availability or in the presence of toxic concentration of aluminum, the exudation of organic acids such as oxalic acid, malic acid, and citric acid is particularly increased.These compounds might act as signals for microbial attraction or be used as carbon sources for microbial nutrition (Nihorimbere et al., 2011).
## (s9) Effi cient Utilization and Recycling of Energy
(p9.0) Photosynthesis is the vital process in plant life.Photosynthesis depends on the plant's ability to utilize solar energy in fixing atmospheric CO 2 into carbohydrate.The energy is further utilized for the biosynthesis of essential components such as amino acids and proteins.However, the fixation of CO 2 by green plants in photosynthesis is sometimes getting extremely low mainly because of the low utilization rate of solar energy by green plants.

(p9.1) Therefore, an integrated and efficient energy utilization process is need to be explored to increase the level of solar energy utilization efficiency by green plants, so that maximum amount of atmospheric CO 2 can be converted into nutrients.Exploration of diverse ways of recycling organic energy usually accumulated in plants and animal residues through direct utilization of organic molecules by plants is an area need to focus in an ideal agricultural system.Microorganisms are essential tool in majority of the soil ecosystem services (Aislabie and Deslippe, 2013) such as efficient utilization of solar energy and recycling of organic molecules.They play crucial role in the biogeochemical cycling of soil nutrients (Bhattacharyya and Jha, 2012).This ensures the turnover and supply of nutrients that are essential for crop growth through the inter-conversion of different forms of nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous molecules, interlinked with the carbon cycle.Microorganisms are responsible for the maintenance of soil structures and sustainability of soil quality for efficient plant growth.Microbial activity in soil is also essential to execute carbon losses to the atmosphere through respiration and methanogenesis, micro-remediation, through degradation of organic pollutions and immobilization of heavy metals, and thereby improving soil quality (Prosser, 2007).However, it is not an easy task to develop an ideal agricultural system until and unless the efficiency of utilizing the solar energy by green plants is increased and the energy contained in existing organic molecules such as amino acids, peptides, and carbohydrates is utilized by the plant.New technologies that can improve the economic viability of farming systems with little or no use of chemical fertilizers/pesticides are need to develop for better agricultural practices.
## (s10) Preservation of Natural Resources and Environment
(p10.0) Animal produced organic wastes, residues of agricultural and marine processing industries, and municipal wastes such as sewage and garbage have become major sources of environmental pollution in both developed and developing countries.The production of CH 4 from paddy fields and ruminant animals and emission of CO 2 from the burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, and organic matter decomposition are some of the serious problems directly related with global warming (Davidson and Janssens, 2006).Chemical-based conventional systems of agricultural practices have also contributed significantly in the degradation of environment and destruction of natural resources.Recycling of diverse pollutants/organic residues through proper utilization is an area need to develop for an ideal agricultural system.Application of suitable microbial resources may hold a suitable promise in conservation of natural resources and environment (Verstraete et al., 2007).Many microbes can grow in large communities called biofilms (Davey and O'toole, 2000), where the microbial cells work together and produce a sticky matrix that holds the cells together and provides protection from environmental threats.A bacterium called Bacillus, commonly found in soil, protects itself by forming a water repellent coat (Nicholson et al., 2000).The process is due to a protein called BsIA produced by the bacterium.

(p10.1) The protein spontaneously assembles to form a water repellent coat, protecting the Bacillus cells underneath.As B. subtilis is currently examined to assess its suitability to use as a widespread bio-fertilizer, the technology of biofilm formation might aid a potential incorporation to develop an ecologically sound method of crop protection.
## (s12) Production of plant growth regulators
(p12.0) Plant growth regulators are synthetic substances similar to natural plant hormones.They can regulate the growth of plants and therefore important in agriculture.Plant growth regulators are not hazardous to human health if they are used in accordance with proper scientific practices and dose.Microorganisms inhabiting rhizosphere of growing plants are likely to synthesize and release auxin, a plant growth regulator, as secondary metabolites (Kapoor et al., 2012).Plant morphogenic effects are the results of existence of different ratios of plant hormones usually produced by roots as well as rhizosphere bacteria.

(p12.1) Diverse soil microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and algae are responsible in producing physiologically active compounds such as various plants growth regulators which may exert physiological effects on plant growth and development (Ahemad and Kibret, 2014).Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can alter root architecture and promote plant growth with the production of phytohormones such as indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid, and cytokinins (Kloepper et al., 2007) and production of important metabolites such as siderophores, HCN, and antibiotics.IAA is one of the most important physiologically active auxins.Several PGPRs as well as some pathogenic, symbiotic and freeliving rhizobacterial species are known to produce IAA and gibberllic acid in the rhizosphere that have immense potentiality in enhancing the root surface area and number of root tips in plants (Han et al., 2005).Figure 1 represents the beneficial aspects of IAA secreted by rhizobacteria.Reports are also available explaining the potentiality of fungi in plant growth promotion (Rahi et al., 2009;Murali et al., 2012).Beneficial fungi are associated with the destruction of fungal pathogens, production of antibiotics, elicitation of defense responses, etc.In addition, many beneficial fungi are able to parasitize spores, sclerotia or hyphae of pathogenic fungi and thereby contribute in biocontrol (Mejia et al., 2008).Production of a large number of degradative enzymes, including chitinases, proteases, and glucanases, is involved in this biocontrol process.Many Trichoderma strains are reported to colonize in association with diverse plant roots and thereby significantly assist in increasing plant growth and development (Saba et al., 2012).In Arabidopsis, normal auxin perception is a prerequisite for growth enhancement when inoculated with Trichoderma virens (Contreras-Cornejo et al., 2009).Root colonization by Trichoderma sp. is frequently associated with the induction of both local and systemic resistance that depends on the production of an elicitor protein called Sm1 (small protein 1) (Djonovic et al., 2006).Sm1 lacks toxic activity to plants and microbes.Native and purified form of Sm1 can trigger the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rice and cotton seedlings and thereby induces the expression of defense-related genes both locally and systemically.The beneficial effects of fungi on plant growth and development might be associated with mechanisms such as mycoparasitism (Jeffries, 1995) followed by direct growth toward it, recognization of host pathogen and its damage.
## (s15) Microorganisms as biofertilizer and biopesticide
(p15.0) Microbial biofertilizers and biopesticides are the best modern tools in agriculture (Bhardwaj et al., 2014).Microbial biofertilizers are the substances that contain live microorganisms which, when applied on the seed, plant surface or soil, colonize the rhizosphere, and promote plant growth through increased supply of primary nutrients for the host (Bhattacharyya and Jha, 2012;Vessey, 2003).

(p15.1) While microbial biopesticides are those microorganisms that promote plant growth by controlling phytopathogenic agents through a wide variety of mechanisms such as production of antibiotics, siderophores, HCN, production of hydrolytic enzymes, acquired and induced systemic resistance (Somers et al., 2004;Chandler et al., 2008).
## (s16) Production of VOCs
(p16.0) VOCs generally represent an orchestrated response to a wide range of stimuli in plants and microbes (Ortiz-Castro et al., 2009).VOCs have high vapor pressures under normal conditions to significantly vaporize and enter in the atmosphere.Low molecular weight compounds (<300 g/mol), such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and hydrocarbons.falls under this category.Choudhary et al.   (Farmer, 2001).However, to acquire a clear appreciation on the mechanisms of VOCs in signaling plants to register themselves against pathogens, efficient knowledge on nature, and accumulation of volatile components in plant-rhizobacteria system need to be explored.
## (s17) Microbes as Biotic Elicitors
(p17.0) Elicitors are molecules usually involved in plant defense mechanism (Thakur and Sohal, 2013).Most of the elicitors are derived from microorganisms irrespective of their nature and type.Exogenous application of defense signaling molecules such as salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and NO induces the accumulation of a wide range of secondary metabolites such as indole glucosinolates, phytoalexins, and alkamides that have immerse potentiality to communicate with beneficial microbial populations (Ortiz-Castro et al., 2009).Signal perception is the first committed step toward the biotic elicitor signal transduction pathway in plants (Yang et al., 1997).For instances, jasmonic acid and its methyl ester are the signal transducers in a wide range of plant cell cultures that might accumulate rapidly when the suspension cultures of Rauvolfi a canescens L. and Eschscholtzia californica Cham.are treated with a yeast elicitor (Roberts and Shuler, 1997).The purification and characterization of specific elicitor-binding protein is essential for detailed understanding of the molecular basis of signal exchange between the hosts and microbial pathogens that eventually leads to activation of host defenses.
## (s18) Microbes in Bioremediation
(p18.0) Bioremediation is the use of organisms to metabolize pollutants.Microorganisms like bacteria, archaea and fungi are known as the prime bioremediators.Bioremediation relies on living organisms to consume and break down the complex compounds, turning it into harmless, natural substances (Kumar et al., 2011), so that it can be disposed at a faster rate and thereby reduce environmental pollution.Bioremediators are the organisms used in bioremediation process.

(p18.1) Mycoremediation (Rhodes, 2014) is the process where fungi are used to decontaminate a particular area.Fungal mycelium is known to secrete extracellular enzymes and acids that have the ability to break down the plant fibers such as lignin and cellulose.Wood degrading fungi are particularly effective in breakdown of aromatic pollutants such as toxic components of petroleum, as well as chlorinated compounds (Rhodes, 2014).Mycofiltration is a process to remediate/metabolize pollutants using fungal mycelia to filter toxic wastes and microorganisms of water bodies as well soil.Different oxidation-reduction reactions are usually accompanied by bioremediators to oxidize the harmful pollutants.However, determining the right microbial species to target a specific pollutant is need to be explored to strengthen the concept of bioremediation using microbes.
## (s19) Microbial Responses in Stress Agriculture
(p19.0) Drought is a global threat to agricultural productivity (Gornall et al., 2010).During drought, plants modulate a series of physiological responses such as the stomatal closure due to an increase of abcisic acid content, the accumulation of compatible solutes, the increased expression of aquaporins and vacuolar H-pyrophosphatases for maintaining the cell turgidity through osmotic adjustments.Ethylene levels also reach at a higher concentration that extensively blocks plant growth (Burg, 1973) and thereby increase root to shoot ratio.An extensively larger root system is, thus, stimulated to increase the water adsorption area.Accumulations of ROS also occur that dramatically deteriorates the cell integrity and functionality and survival of the plant (Gill and Tuteja, 2010).

(p19.1) Rhizosphere and endosphere are the two important regions where optimum colonization of microbials reported (Berg et al., 2014).Mycorrhizal fungi and PGP bacteria are capable of modulating the physiological responses (Vacheron et al., 2013) and thereby helps in increasing plant tolerance to survive under adverse environmental conditions.In vitro as well as pot experiments confirmed the potentiality of rhizosphere and endosphere bacteria in improving the plant growth and tolerance during stress.

(p19.2) The plant growth of microbial inoculated plants increased up to 40% suggesting the potentiality of PGP microbes in agriculture (Perez-Montano et al., 2014).The role of plant-associated microbiomes in plant adaptation toward drought is, thus, emerging.Microbiome composition at a particular environmental condition may vary significantly (Marasco et al., 2012) as it strictly depends on the taxonomic variability of the associated plant species.
## (s20) Microbial Antagonism
(p20.0) Beneficial microorganisms can suppress the growth of phytopathogens in a variety of ways such as competing for nutrients and space, limiting the supply of available nutrients to pathogens (Marasco et al., 2012).The microflora of disease-suppressive soils is usually dominated by antagonistic microorganisms that have the ability to produce diverse array of antibiotics (Mohseni et al., 2013).Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma, and antagonistic actinomycetes are known as potent hub to produce diverse antibiotics (Zivkovic et al., 2010) of varying mode of action.Many strains of Trichoderma are strong opportunistic invaders (Rahul et al., 2014).Antibiotics produced by antagonistic microbials have biostatic and biocidal effects on soil-borne plant pathogens.
## (s22) Quorum Sensing (QS)
(p22.0) QS refers to the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell population density (Miller and Bassler, 2001).Bacteria are known to produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducer (AI) molecules responsible for cell to cell communications.The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an auto inducer leads to an alteration in gene expression.Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use QS communication circuits (Rutherford and Bassler, 2012) to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities within a living cell.The processes include symbiosis, virulence, competence, conjugation, antibiotic production, motility, sporulation, and biofilm formation.In general, Gram-negative bacteria use acylated homoserine lactones as auto inducers and Gram-positive bacteria use processed oligopeptides to communicate (Miller and Bassler, 2001).Commonly reported autoinducer signals are N-acyl homoserine lactones (von Bodman et al., 2003), although half a dozen of other molecules, including diketopiperazines in several Gram-negative bacteria (Holden et al., 1999), furanosyl borate diester in Vibrio harveyi (Chen et al., 2002) and c-butyrolactone in Streptomyces (Yamada and Nihira, 1998) have also been implicated in density-dependent signaling.Extensive investigations on QS signal interference mechanisms might broaden the scope of modern microbiological research.
## (s24) Plant-microbe Interactions Due to Climate Change
(p24.0) Climate change is the statistical change in the distribution of weather patterns (Compant et al., 2010) over an extensive period of time, ranging from decades to millions of years.Change in climate can alter the environmental conditions drastically as a result of which plant-microbe associations may be affected.

(p24.1) Microbial processes are often dependent on environmental factors (Compant et al., 2010;Kheyrodin and Ghazvinian, 2012) such as temperature, moisture, CO 2 concentrations in atmosphere, enzyme activity, and nutrient availability, all of which are likely to be affected by climate change.Elevated CO 2 had a positive influence on the abundance of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, whereas the effects on plant growth-promoting bacteria and endophytic fungi were more variable.The mycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius that depends entirely on plant assimilates of Pinus silvestris L., are known to grown at a faster rate at increased CO 2 concentrations (Ineichen et al., 1995).Mycelial biomass production by Hebeloma crustuliniforme in Pinus sylvestris (L.) Karst.seedlings were significantly greater under elevated CO 2 , up to a threefold increase in comparison with ambient CO 2 (Fransson et al., 2005).This suggests the ability of the fungus to produce more mycelium as a consequence of increased C availability.However, the mycorrhizal hyphal growth is found to be reduced due to elevated CO 2 concentrations.Elevated CO 2 concentration is likely to increase the C (carbon) allocation to the plant roots and thereby significantly hampers the normal physiological and growth promoting activities of plant root associated microbes.The effects of increased temperature on beneficial plant-microbe associations are more variable and varied considerably with the study system and the temperature range investigated.

(p24.2) Temperature and soil type may affect the performance of plant-beneficial bacteria (Egamberdiyeva and Hoflich, 2003) certain PGP strains are known to grow better at a high temperature than at a low temperature and could be of special interest for application in agriculture exposed to increased temperatures.Waldon et al. (1989) showed that rhizobia isolated from nodules of the desert woody legume Prosopis glandulosa grew better at 36°C than at 26°C.Another investigation with endophyte Burkholderia phytofi rmans strain PsJN demonstrated that a temperature increase from 10°C to 30°C reduced the colonization of the strain in tomato rhizosphere.Increase in temperature can significantly alter the structure of mycorrhizal hyphal network system that may be linked to faster C allocation.
## (s26) CONCLUSION
(p26.0) Due to excessive and injudicial use of chemical fertilizers, agriculture faces diverse challenges (Plimmer, 1984;Bhattacharyya et al., 2015).Synthetic fertilizers are known to destroy a large percentage of soil's naturally-occurring nutrients.Moreover, due to long-term application of chemicals in soil, there are also losses of native soil microflora.Soil, deprived of its microorganisms, undergoes a rapid decline in soil structure, and it gradually loses its ability to retain water, air and nutrients.Plants grown in such depleted soil are extremely susceptible to damage from diseases, insects, and drought.The utilization of effective and beneficial microbes is the only way to overcome such type of obstacles.Soil rich in beneficial/effective microorganisms, encourages the natural immune system of the plants, limits the population of phytopathogens, resists parasitic insects, and creates ideal situations for agriculture.Integrated pest and disease management strategies should, therefore, be adopted for the control of pest and pathogenic attack in agriculture.Integrated nutrient management strategy is important for the maintenance of soil fertility and plant nutrient supply at an optimum level to sustain the desired crop productivity.This is done through optimization of the benefits from all possible sources of plant nutrients in an integrated manner.Both the two processes are ecofriendly and cost effective that would serve as an asset of sustainable agricultural practice.Attempts should be generated to assess and predict the climate change that might influence the diversity, distribution and activity of soil microbes capable of contributing overall plant growth and development potential.Change in environmental conditions due to climate alterations is likely to induce changes in plant physiology and root exudation (Madhu and Hatfield, 2013;Sardans and Penuelas, 2012).The research is essential to improve the knowledge on native biodiversity and microbial community structure, under changing climate scenario.Finally, though the evidence gathered so far demonstrates that climate change is likely to have a significant impact on plant and microbial growth, the exact consequences of future climate change on plantmicrobe interaction are difficult to predict due to the complex interactions between various climate parameters (e.g., CO 2 , temperature) and soil physicochemical properties (soil nutrition, microbial diversity, heavy metal concentration), etc.
