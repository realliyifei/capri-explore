## (s1) Local factors Traumatic ulcer
(p1.0) Physical traumatic ulcers are more common in oral cavity.Mainly due to sharp tooth,illfitting dentures,rough fillings ,fractured restoration,orthodontic appliance,sharp foreign body,bitting 1 .Appears as yellow base with erythematous borders & heals in 7 -14 days if cause is removed .
## (s10) Fungal Mucormycosis
(p10.0) Mucormycosis (zygomycosis) is a rare, aggressive, invasive fungal infection that usually afflicts immunosuppressed patients 11 .Most common 3 rd invasive fungal infection,following aspergillosis and candiadiasis and also found in autopsies of hematologic patients.occur in soil & manure,Which is very common in diabetic pts & it represents a necrotic lesion of the palate.Mode of spread throughdirect extension or through blood vessels and lymph vessels.othersites involved are buccal mucosa,upper and lower lip,mandible.Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is the most common type and its extension to the orbit and brain is quite usual 12 .Intraorally,ulcer with raised erythematous borders with surface of the ulcer appearing black and necrotic with areas of denudation is seen.Often associated with traid of symptoms,Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,periorbital infection, meningo encephalitis.
## (s15) Mucocutaneous Lichen planus
(p15.0) It is a common mucocutaneous disease.Oral lesions may accompany or even precede the appearance of skin and genital lesions.Seen in adulthood, and children are rarely affected.usually observed in nervous, 'highly strung' people (Shaler 1983).Mainly due to stress and T cell mediated condition and other causes includes trauma, malnutrition and infection.It can occur anywhere in the oral cavity.The buccal mucosa.tongue, and gingiva are the most common sites, whereas palatal lesions are uncommon.They are usually symmetrical and bilateral lesions or multiple lesions in the mouth.Andreasen (1968) histopathologically divided oral lichen planus into six types: reticular, papular, plaque-like, erosive, atrophic, and bullous.The reticular, papular, and plaque-like forms are usually painless and appear clinically as white keratolic lesions.The bullous , atrophic, and erosive forms are often associated with a burning sensation and in many cases can cause severe pain 15 .
## (s20) Miscellaneous Necrotizing sialometaplasia
(p20.0) It is a rare, self limiting, variably ulcerated, benign, inflammatory process, predominantly affecting salivary tissue.The importance of the lesion is that it may be mistaken for a malignancy and lead to inappropriately radical surgery.The vast majority (80%) of cases affect the minor salivary glands of the palate, while other sites include retromolar pad, gingiva, lip, tongue and cheek.The condition has also been reported in major salivary glands.A sub-acute variant has also been described.association with other tumours, specifically: Warthin's tumour, Abrisokov's tumour, carcinoma of the lip, rapidly growing mesenchymal malignancy and salivary gland tumours.The lesions may 1 occur bilaterally and metachronously.When ulceration occurs, it usually remains superficial, but a single case of full-thickness necrosis of the palate has been reported.The lesion heals spontaneously over a period of two to twelve weeks.Drug therapy with intra-lesional steroids appears to offer no benefit on recovery time of the lesion or associated anaesthesia 16 .
