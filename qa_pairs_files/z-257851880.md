## (s3) Mineral composition and their reactivity
(p3.0) The mineral composition of different varieties of ginger can vary depending on agronomic conditions, curing, drying methods, storage conditions and reactions. [90]The presence of minerals in ginger with their various phytochemicals and vitamins benefits consumers from a nutritional, medicinal, pharmacological, and epidemiological point of view.Its use is beneficial for improving appetite and the palatability of food.Furthermore, it is used to facilitate nutrient absorption and enhanced flow of gastric enzymes. [91]Ginger minerals reduce harmful microorganisms and oxidation during food preservation and processing.The minerals in ginger also contribute to the acid-base balance and the maintenance of body fluids, in the movement of gases between tissues.
## (s12) Ginger Anti-Inflammatory properties
(p12.0) The anti-inflammatory effects of ginger extracts can be detected using an immunohistochemical technique, and extracts have been shown to significantly reduce the expression of transcription factors NF (B) and inflammation marker TNF-.The anti-inflammatory potential of pure 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol on hepatoma cells investigated by Weng et al. [162] showed that treatment of 13-acetate (PMA)-treated HepG2 and PMA-untreated Hep3B cells with 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol, phorbol 12-myristate, reduced the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner.Their migration and invasion of cells was reduced.After incubation with these compounds, both Antioxidant mechanisms of ginger.

## (s14) Post-harvest handling of ginger
(p14.0) Ginger requires optimal processing methods, storage types and mechanisms for the domestic and the export markets.Due to its different active ingredients, ginger is considered a safe medicinal plant with few significant side effects. [169]However, the traditional processing methods and storage pose challenges to ginger production and use.In processing, drying is the most widely used technique to preserve ginger, since fresh ginger contains a high-water content (80-95%) that can lead to microbial spoilage.Poor post-harvest handling and storage of fresh ginger results in reduced shelf life and significant post-harvest losses.These problems challenge ginger producers and processors in developing countries who may not have access to up-to-date methods.

(p14.1) Ginger needs lots of attention during drying to preserve the overall quality of the end product as well as the sensory and physico-chemical properties. [76]Most ginger producers store ginger of different sizes in one place in traditional packaging and ship it to markets using inferior containers.Ginger transportation materials and storage containers are often not well ventilated, which can damage the rhizomes.For the domestic market, the use of plastic bags, nets, and wooden boxes that provide better protection is rare.

(p14.2) Throughout the world, the food value chain is linked to long-term interactions between human societies, our ancestral agroecological landscapes, and various trading systems.In developing countries like Ethiopia, small-scale ginger farmers face many challenges in using ginger to enhance food value or to derive a benefit from its bioactive components. [170]Companies that carry out activities to increase the value of a product from primary ginger production through processing and marketing to the final product for consumers play a vital role.Processing ginger to the minimum microbial activity level is used to prevent degradation.It also facilitates the transportation of ginger-based food and provides the dried product regardless of the season. [171]However, most developing countries use sunair drying methods to dehydrate ginger and other crops, which can be nutritionally and biologically challenging.The long drying time of this technique (15 days and more) results in severe degradation of the color and nutritional quality of the final product. [172]dequate processing is required to realize the full potential of ginger.However, some operations are very expensive in comparison to traditional processing.Based on some studies, improved processing methods can enhance its nutritional, antioxidant, physico-chemical, sensory and structural properties. [135,173]Ginger that is not well processed can be exposed to biological and chemical contamination during the post-harvest period.This can result in the production of toxic substances such as aflatoxins. [174]educed access to appropriate processing, storage, and transport facilities are also influencing factors, often cited as challenges in developing countries. [175]The use of ginger as a food additive must therefore begin with cultivation and processing using innovative practices and techniques.The lack of an organized market information service for the different players in the ginger farm-to-market can affect the whole value chain.The fewer channels for ginger products to enter the international market through market promotion and creation of market links are mostly controlled by the world's largest producers and consumers of ginger. [136]The use of ginger in food processing could be used for strengthening buyerproducer relationships.To do this in the food supply chain and to take greater advantage of its health benefits the process must start with small farmers, go through the processors and end with the consumers.
