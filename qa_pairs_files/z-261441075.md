## (s6) Selection process
(p6.0) All the citations retrieved from PubMed were uploaded into Covidence -Better systematic review management (49), which automatically removes duplicates and is ready to provide a PRISMA flowchart.A thorough screening of titles and abstracts followed by full-text screening was performed by four reviewers.Each methodological step was conducted by two independent researchers on Covidence to ensure their eligibility to be used to produce a narrative of the key results per PHMS.
## (s8) Study risk of bias assessment
(p8.0) Risk of bias in the studies included was assessed by a tool developed by Whiting and colleagues to assess the risk of bias in systematic reviews -ROBIS (50).This tool focuses on assessing four domains, comprising the adequate objectives and eligible criteria, the search and databases used, the study characteristics provided, and the synthesis of results, plus, an overall risk domain.
## (s16) Test, trace, and vaccinate
(p16.0) Specific to testing policies, most of the studies reviewed conclude that testing policies (along with case isolation, social distancing, and face masks) can effectively control a new outbreak of COVID-19.However, a study assessing the accuracy of screening strategies showed inconclusive results on the usefulness of combined screening, repeated symptom assessment, and rapid laboratory tests (41).
