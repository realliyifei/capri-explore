## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Energy has been the fundamental engine of industry and society at least since the first industrial revolution [25]. It has been a determinant factor which shaped society for centuries and it promises to be even more important in the 21st century at the time of the so-called Industry 4.0 [6].
## (s4) Digitalization in energy sector
(p4.0) Paper Title: RP-2-Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Aggregation Based on Blockchain for Power Grid Communications in Smart Communities [11]. Problem Addressed: Real-time data from user appliance is required for optimal scheduling of Smart grids but it also means disclosing users private information and raise the issue of privacy. Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a privacy-preserving and efficient data aggregation scheme. Where users are divided into groups and attached with a blockchain to record data for the group members. Pseudonyms are being used to hide user identity within the group. Users are free to create as many pseudonyms and can associate their data with it. To ensure a fast authentication boom filter has been used.
