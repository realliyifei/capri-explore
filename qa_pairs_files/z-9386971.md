## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most common type of arthritis and the major cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain and mobility disability in the elderly, and therefore represents a significant burden on healthcare provision.It is being encountered with increasing frequency as the population continues to age.Risk factors of OA of the knee include older age, female sex, obesity, osteoporosis, occupation, sports activities, previous trauma, muscle weakness or dysfunction, proprioceptive deficit and genetic factors [1] .In primary OA of the knee, varus alignment increases the risk of medial OA progression and valgus alignment increases the risk of lateral OA progression [2] .Optimal management of patients with OA of the knee requires a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies [3] .

(p0.1) Conservative treatment is advocated in patients with mild to moderate OA of the knee.Because muscle weakness is associated with pain and physical dysfunction and influences the progression of the disease in patients with OA of the knee [4][5][6][7][8] , muscle strengthening is a key component in cases of OA.The objective of this paper is to discuss the effectiveness of exercise for OA of the knee based on a review of the literature, i.e. systematic reviews and meta-analyses searched with PubMed.
## (s3) OA OF THE KNEE
(p3.0) Recommendations cover the use of 12 non-pharmacological modalities: education and self-management, regular telephone contacts, referral to a physical therapist, aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture [3] .Eight recommendations cover pharmacological modalities of treatment including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase-2 non-selective and selective oral NSAIDs, topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, intraarticular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronates, glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulphate for symptom relief; glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and diacerein for possible structure-modifying effects; and opioid analgesics for the treatment of refractory pain [3] .However, consensus recommendations are not always supported by the best available evidence [9] .The recommendations have been revised regularly, following a systematic review of new evidence as this becomes available [3,10] .
## (s4) EXERCISE FOR OA OF THE KNEE
(p4.0) Because pain, muscle weakness and physical dysfunction form a vicious circle in OA of the knee in which muscle weakness is associated with pain and physical dysfunction and influences the progression of the disease [4][5][6][7][8] , muscle strengthening exercise may be of primary importance in the prevention and treatment of OA of the knee.
## (s9) Systematic review
(p9.0) Evidence of beneficial effects of exercise therapy in patients with OA of the hip or knee.Effect sizes indicated smallto-moderate beneficial effects of exercise therapy on pain, small beneficial effects on disability outcome measures and moderate-to-great beneficial effects, according to patients' global assessment of effect Fransen et al [12] (2002)
## (s10) Systematic review
(p10.0) Land-based therapeutic exercise was shown to reduce pain and improve physical function for people with OA of the knee.SMD (95% CI) was 0.46 (0.35, 0.57) for pain and 0.33 (0.23, 0.43) for self-reported physical function Fransen et al [13] (2003)
## (s11) Systematic review
(p11.0) Land-based therapeutic exercise was shown to reduce pain and improve physical function for people with OA of the knee.SMD (95% CI) was 0.39 (0.30, 0.47) for pain and 0.31 (0.23, 0.39) for self-reported physical function Roddy et al [14] (2005)
## (s12) Systematic review
(p12.0) Both aerobic walking and home-based quadriceps strengthening exercise reduced pain and disability from OA of the knee.Pooled effect sizes for pain were 0.52 for aerobic walking and 0.32 for quadriceps strengthening Devos-Comby et al [15] (2006)
## (s13) Metaanalysis
(p13.0) Exercise regimens led to improvement in physical health (by self-report and direct measures) and in overall impact of OA of the knee.Exercise had a moderate, but clinically important influence on patients' well-being Vignon et al [16] (2006)
## (s14) Systematic review
(p14.0) Exercises and other structured activities had a favorable effect on pain and function in sedentary knee OA patients.Static exercises were not favored over dynamic exercises, availability, preference and tolerance being the criteria for the choice of exercise Bartels et al [17] (2007)
## (s16) Systematic review
(p16.0) Strong evidence was found for no long-term effectiveness of exercise on pain and self-reported physical function, moderate evidence for long-term effectiveness on patient global assessment of effectiveness, and conflicting evidence for observed physical function in patients with OA of the hip and/or knee Fransen et al [19,20] (2008, 2009)
## (s18) DISCUSSION
(p18.0) A review of the literature has suggested that muscle strengthening and aerobic exercises are effective in reducing pain and improving physical function in patients with mild to moderate OA of the knee.Maximizing adherence is a key element dictating success of exercise therapy [24] .This can be enhanced by the use of supervised exercise sessions (possibly in a class format) in the initial exercise period followed by home exercises [24] .A combination of weekly facility-based supervised exercise and independent daily home-based exercise may be acceptable to patients.The effects of high-resistance strength training are not always greater than those of low-resistance strength training in patients with OA of the knee [25] .Aerobic exercise may be well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate OA of the knee, whereas muscle strengthening exercise at a moderate intensity may be well tolerated in elderly patients with severe OA of the knee.Although there is still no evidence that the type of strengthening exercises (isometric, isotonic, isokinetic, concentric, eccentric and dynamic) have an important impact on the program outcome [26] , isometric and isotonic strengthening exercises may be practical.Hurley et al [27] suggest that integrated rehabilitation programs that are acceptable, clinically effective, deliverable and affordable may be the best way of managing the large and increasing number of people suffering chronic knee pain.
