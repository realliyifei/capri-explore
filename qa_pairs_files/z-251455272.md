## (s5) Coding thematic analysis
(p5.0) We employ NVivo 12 for coding thematic analysis.This program provides tools for data/documents management while allowing the user coding capabilities via browsing and interpreting data/documents (Azeem et al. 2012;Johnston 2006;Khandker 2022).Additionally, it generates a synthesis of identified ideas and develops a better understanding of identified categories and themes (Azeem et al. 2012;Johnston 2006;Khandker 2022).The steps involved in the coding thematic analysis are as follows:

(p5.1) (a) In step one, we apply a word cloud analysis of the more frequent words from all selected articles.These words then need to be analysed to generate relevant keywords that represent the IDP context.(b) In step two, we generate codes based on the identified keywords.We analyse the relevance of the identified keywords from the previous step and consider 1 3

(p5.2) The investment development path literature: a review and… the findings from the manual thematic analysis to generate suitable codes that capture the pertinent literature on IDP.(c) In step three we generate nodes (categories) based on the selected codes.The codes generated from step two are analysed to determine the potential nodes for the following step.(d) The last step is to generate themes based on the identified nodes.The nodes from step three are analysed and developed into clusters (themes).The purpose of generating themes in the literature review paper is to investigate what topics are covered in the IDP literature and to identify the potential areas for further research within each topic.
## (s13) The company strategy in terms of choice of location for engaging in OFDI
(p13.0) As mentioned in the previous section, company strategy is one of the key factors that influences IFDI investment in the host country as well as OFDI from the home country.Table 6 presents eight studies that focus on the company location decision strategy to engage in foreign investment (Barnard 2008;Erdilek 2008;Filippov 2010;Galan et al. 2007;Ramírez-Alesón and Fleta-Asín 2016;Sim 2006;Sim and Pandian 2007;Yeoh 2011).

(p13.1) These studies identify influential factors that companies consider in the location decision process of foreign investment by MNCs from developed and developing countries.In the case of developed countries, managers consider strategic asset-investment factors as their motivation to engage in OFDI in European Union countries (Galan et al. 2007).They also consider cultural distance, historical respect, and social factors as the main determinants of investment in Latin American countries (Galan et al. 2007).Meanwhile, in the case of developing countries, the characteristics of the location choices for OFDI are: the size of MNCs and their focus on globalisation, provision of markets and competitive cost, and the advantages and disadvantages of their proposed strategies (i.e., adaptation to markets and relative cost of investment, entry mode strategy e.g., joint venture, and cultural and historical distance) (Sim 2006).The internationalisation strategies considered by firms in the case of TWMNCs are as follows: (a) In the case of Malaysian and Taiwanese companies, the drivers and motivations for OFDI are competitive cost and other L-advantages that are supported by the aspects of ethnic distance (Sim and Pandian 2007); (b) In the case of Turkish MNCs, the drivers and motivations for OFDI are liberalisation in both the home country's regulations in relation to its investment climate to push OFDI, and the host country's regulations to pull OFDI in terms of fiscal benefits, and access to natural resources, markets, technologies, and brands (Erdilek 2008); (c) MNCs with established O-advantages in the home country tend to seek investment in low-to-medium research industries (Barnard 2008); (d) In the case of Russian MNCs, the motives and drivers for OFDI are resourceseeking investments to acquire the host country's resources, market-seeking investments for entering new markets or developing existing markets, and efficiency-seeking investments to increase MNCs' efficiency by taking advantage of the host country's economies of scale (Filippov 2010); (e) In the case of Indian pharmaceutical companies, the motives and drivers for OFDI are to absorb and to acquire knowledge from the potential host country locations for OFDI, i.e., economic conditions, institutional factors related to knowledge association, and social networks (Yeoh 2011).

(p13.2) Based on the explanation above, it appears that each company has its own policies and strategies for entering a foreign country.Therefore, we confirm the important role of host country governments in reforming their policies and regulations to attract IFDI to the country and to ensure that the spillover effects of foreign investment occur.Domestic companies can gain benefits from the spillover effect and contribute to the country's development.We also confirm the important role of the home country's government in stimulating the establishment and development of domestic companies to compete with MNCs in the domestic market and to boost domestic companies' ownership advantages to engage in OFDI in the global market.
## (s14) The internal and external factors that influence a country's position in the IDP stages
(p14.0) In the previous section, we mentioned the factors that can influence IFDI and OFDI and hence influence the position of a country in the IDP stages.In this section, we focus on studies pertaining to influential factors (i.e., internal and external factors) that can shift a country's position in the IDP stages.Table 7 presents four studies that focus on these factors (Dunning et al. 2001;Gorynia et al. 2020;Narula 1993;Yin et al. 2021).
## (s22) The fourth approach based on MNCs strategy
(p22.0) In addition to the L-advantages, trends, and patterns of FDI in a country, we recommend exploring the motives of MNCs to engage in OFDI.This information can be used as a reference for a country to assess and frame its L-advantages and design its policies and regulations to attract IFDI (targeted-IFDI).Hence, the home country can gain benefit from the presence of IFDI to generate more OFDI.Accordingly, the fourth approach is based on Narula and Dunning (2010), in which we capture the motives of MNCs to engage in OFDI and, hence, the motives of IFDI to the host country in terms of IDP stages, as follows:

(p22.1) (a) In stage 1, the motive for IFDI is natural resource seeking-investment due to the lack of natural resource endowment in the home country.(b) In stage 2, the motive for IFDI is investment driven.Thus, MNCs' motives to engage in IFDI might be natural resource seeking as well as market-seeking investment due to MNCs' interest in exploring other markets and serving the domestic and adjacent regional markets.(c) In stage 3, the motive for IFDI is innovation driven.The natural resource-seeking motive is already decreasing for IFDI, and MNCs' motives focus on marketseeking investment, efficiency-seeking, and strategic asset-seeking investment due to the availability of advanced infrastructure, markets, and labour.(d) In stage 4, the motives for IFDI are increasing in relation to service-and knowledge-intensive investments.The market-seeking investment motive is already decreasing for IFDI, and the MNCs motives focus on efficiency-seeking and strategic asset-seeking investments to produce and serve the market effectively and efficiently.(e) In stage 5, the motives of OFDI are increasing at a significant level in terms of efficiency-seeking and strategic asset-seeking, where there is no single country that has predominant capabilities to produce and serve the market.

(p22.2) The advantage of this approach is that the motives of IFDI and OFDI in IDP stages can be treated as a reference for the host and home country governments to develop a conducive investment environment by providing supportive policies and regulations to attract more IFDI and to generate more OFDI.The disadvantage of this approach is that it only focuses on MNCs strategies.The government also plays an important role in providing suitable policies and regulations related to MNCs strategies.Therefore, we suggest an additional approach for IDP stage classification by considering government roles.
