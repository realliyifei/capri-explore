## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Genes are hereditary units formed by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences organized in chromosomes in the cell nucleus.The intricate process of transcription from these sequences results in the generation of messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA).These mRNA code for proteins, which are composed of amino acids, and carry out the designated function of the gene (1).Thus, the structural and functional features of cells and tissues are determined by the simultaneous, selective, and differential expression of thousands of genes.

(p0.1) Since the last decade, studies involving gene mapping, cloning, and sequencing have provided significant information for the structural analysis of distinct genomes (2,3).The quantity of information obtained from these investigations necessitates organization of the acquired data.To satisfy this need, public databases have been created to store millions of gene sequences and expressed sequences tags (ESTs), permitting accession to gene sequences for analysis of the similarities as well as the differences between genomes of distinct species (4).

(p0.2) Structural studies of genomes have raised numerous questions related to the functional and regulatory understanding of gene expression profiles in distinct cell types and tissues from various organisms (3,5,6).DNA microarray technology was developed to study the complex biological processing involving several thousand genes (7,8).One such microarray technology uses single DNA strands or probes (oligomers) which are imprinted onto a glass surface using photolithography (9).Another DNA microarray methodology, which is the focus of the present review, is complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray technology (10).With these methodologies it is possible 1) to simultaneously compare the dynamic expression pattern of thousands of genes in cells or tissues, 2) to detect molecular differences during distinct stages of cellular processes, e.g., differentiation, proliferation, and the induction of apoptosis, 3) to identify transcriptional differences between non-diseased and pathological conditions, 4) to identify changes in cells due to a drug response, and 5) to identify novel biomarkers for potential use in the diagnosis, prognosis and clinical therapy of diseases.
## (s3) Hybridization of the cDNA probe with the target DNA microarray matrix
(p3.0) A crucial factor for successful hybridization of the cDNA probe to the target DNA microarray matrix relies on the quality of the mRNA from cells or tissues.Contaminants of the probe RNA with genomic DNA, proteins, or detergent residues may result in false-positive/false-negative data.

(p3.1) Labeling the probe during cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription of RNA sequences depends on the type of cDNA microarray being used (16).In general, when cDNA microarray analysis is performed using nylon membranes as the substrate, the probe RNA is radioactively labeled by incorporation of dCTP-P 33 nucleotides during the process of reverse transcription (7).In the case of a cDNA microarray printed on glass slides, radioactive nucleotides (17) and fluorescent dyes with high efficiency rates of incorporation, such as the cyanines Cy-3 dUTP and Cy-5 dUTP, are used (8).For more information about types of cDNA microarrays and the hybridization process (7,8,(17)(18)(19)(20), see Table 1.
