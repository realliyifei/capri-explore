## (s14) Proposition 3.12. [7, Proposition 3.5] Suppose
(p14.0) is strictly increasing on (0, ∞) and on −∞, 1 A(ν) . Proof. It is known ( [10]) that the function k ν (.) is strictly increasing on (0, ∞), we will use the same reasoning to show that it is also increasing on −∞, 1 A(ν) . We first observe that for θ ∈ −∞, 1 A(ν) , the expression (1 − θx) is negative for all x in the support of ν. In fact,
## (s28) Some approximations in CSK family
(p28.0) In this paragraph, we give an approximation of elements of the CSK family generated by the boolean Gaussian distribution and an approximation of elements of the CSK family generated by the boolean Poisson distribution, (see [20] for more details).
