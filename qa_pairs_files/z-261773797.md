## (s5) Supply of veterinary pharmaceuticals to smallholder farmers
(p5.0) The availability, access and proper use of veterinary pharmaceuticals are critical for the success of veterinary interventions in the smallholder sector in Zimbabwe.However, smallholder farmers in Sub Saharan Africa, including Zimbabwe face significant challenges in accessing veterinary medicines (Jaime et al., 2022).Previously, smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe used to obtain veterinary drugs from Animal Health and Management Centres (AHMCs), but the hyperinflation and disbanding of the drug revolving fund system within the DVS have disrupted this supply chain (DVS, personal communication).As a result, farmers now have to travel to nearby towns or service centers, incurring high transport costs, to obtain the necessary drugs.

(p5.1) This scarcity of veterinary medicines has created opportunities for opportunistic individuals who take advantage of the unavailability of drugs and the lack of information by the farmers.As noted by Jaime et al., (2022), the supply of veterinary drugs in sub-Saharan Africa has been taken over by private non-professional actors.These individuals sometimes sell falsified, substandard, or improperly stored drugs, leading to improper use and potential risks to animal health and antimicrobial resistance.Farmers have reported purchasing veterinary drugs from roadside markets known as "baccosi,"
## (s6) Human health protection in the smallholder sector
(p6.0) In the smallholder sector, livestock is slaughtered for various purposes, including home consumption, sale, or as part of celebrations and ceremonies.However, the slaughtering practices often do not take place at registered hygienic slaughter facilities and are not subject to inspection (Prinsen et al, 2020).Additionally, there are instances where animals that have died from diseases or unknown causes are processed for human consumption.This situation presents a significant challenge in terms of zoonotic disease transmission, posing risks to human health.
## (s7) State of veterinary services provision in the smallholder sector
(p7.0) It is widely recognized that veterinary services provision to smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing nations is a significant challenge (Ilukor et al., 2015), and Zimbabwe is no exception.In Zimbabwe, veterinary services for smallholder farmers are generally provided for free or highly subsidized by the state through the DVS.
## (s8) Conclusion
(p8.0) The literature review highlights the inadequacy of current veterinary services for smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe, leading to significant livestock losses.To protect their livelihoods, smallholder communities urgently require a viable and sustainable animal disease control service.Mutambara et al. (2013) suggests promoting the CAHW system to supplement the services offered by the DVS and enhance accessibility and cost-effectiveness for smallholder farmers.An integrated veterinary system that fosters collaboration and synergies between veterinarians and paraprofessionals, as well as incorporating community participation, may be effective in delivering quality veterinary services.

(p8.1) The lack of legal recognition and clear role definition for non-veterinarians within the veterinary structure contributes to controversies surrounding their involvement.It is crucial to establish a legal framework that recognizes the responsibilities and minimal training requirements for paravets, thus ensuring their incorporation into the veterinary system.Such a framework would enhance the governance and regulation of veterinary services, particularly for smallholder farmers.

(p8.2) Furthermore, collaboration and referral networks between veterinarians and paraprofessionals, both from the public and private sectors, can address structural shortcomings in the livestock sector.This collaborative approach would improve disease surveillance, detection, reporting, and the prudent use of antimicrobial agents.

(p8.3) To ensure the success of involving multiple players in enhancing veterinary services, it is essential to consider the demand for services from livestock farmers.Consultation with farmers and obtaining their input regarding structural changes in the provision of veterinary services is vital.Their decision-making regarding the health of their livestock needs to be considered, ensuring that the services provided are perceived as valuable and outweigh the associated costs.
