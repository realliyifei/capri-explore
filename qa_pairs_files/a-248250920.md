## (s11) Electrochemical Techniques
(p11.0) Electrochemical techniques are used in order to analyze the loss (oxidation) or gain of electrons (reduction) that given material undergoes during an electrical stimulus. These oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions provide information such as concentration, kinetics, reaction mechanisms and other behaviors of a specie in solution [68]. That said, from electrochemical measurement it is possible to obtain a wide range of electrical properties such as potential, current, charge and time, allowing to evaluate the performance of a biosensor.

(p11.1) As stated before, electrochemical biosensors can be classified according to the characteristics of the signal obtained by transduction. Thus, according to the type of signal, which may be potential difference, current intensity or impedance/conductance changes, biosensors can be classified as potentiometric, amparometric and impedimetric, respectively [69]. Electrochemical biosensors, compared to the different types of biosensors described above, are the most common ones as they shown to be the most successful in biofluid analysis, given their high versatility, low cost, simplicity of production, high sensitivity and selectivity, low detection time, simplicity of operation and ease of adaptation to miniaturization, portability and wearable formats. Electrochemical biosensors are classified according to how the analyte is measured, that is, with the electrochemical technique used to measure the resulting current [12,69,70].

## (s18) Electochemical Impedance Spectrocopy (EIS)
(p18.0) The EIS allows obtaining information about the different time constants associated with the electrochemical processes that occur at the electrode interface. In this technique, a small sinusoidal perturbation is applied to the working electrode and its response when it is in steady state is recorded. Normally, the disturbance is applied to the potential and the resulting current is measured. In general, the EIS analyzes the variations in the electrical transfer charges of the redox system that occur at the electrode of work through each modification step. This technique is used to characterize the resistance, corresponding to the ability of a circuit to resist the flow of current [72].

(p18.1) The presence of the bioreceptor on the electrode surface occurs when there is an increase in the resistance of electron transfer. Impedance is the proportionality factor between the Potential (E) and Current (I) over time, being measured in Ohm, as represented in Equation (2).

## (s22) Molecularly Imprinted Polymers
(p22.0) Usually, the integration of natural bioreceptors into biosensors causes low stability and durability, since they end up having little resistance to adverse environments such as high temperatures, high pressure and pH variations. In addition to being unstable outside it natural environment, small amounts may exist or even not exist for a given target analyte. Thus, an alternative technique called Molecular Printing has recently emerged, allowing the creation of these structures in an artificial way. It consists of a technology capable of producing polymers provided with specific recognition locations, molded from a template molecule, which may be the analyte itself or a similar structure [82]. Comparing with systems that use natural bioreceptors such as enzymes and antibodies, this technology has advantages such as low cost, robustness, high stability, long-term durability and selectivity [83]. Regarding to the development of alcohol biosensors from molecular imprint polymers (MIPs) as a bioreceptor the literature is limited.

(p22.1) In general, the synthesis process of a MIP includes three main steps: complexation (1); polymerization (2) and extraction (3), as shown in Figure 8. The first step allows the functional monomers to interact with the template molecule, forming a complex (template/monomer) through covalent or non-covalent bonds. The second step concerns the polymerization of the monomers present in the complex through a cross linker, forming a rigid polymer. This polymerization reaction is started after the addition of a radical initiator and the mixing of polymerization usually has a solvent that induces the formation of pores in the polymer (porogenic solvent) giving rise to a rigid polymer matrix. Finally, the third stage deals with the extraction of the template from the polymeric matrix by successive washing processes, in order to break the bonds between the template and the polymeric matrix, giving rise to the specific cavities [84]. These cavities give the MIP the ability to selectively recognize and retain the initial molecule present in any sample complex [82].

(p22.2) During the process of synthesizing a MIP, factors such as stoichiometric ratios of the components, temperature and time of the polymerization reaction have a significant impact on chemical and morphological properties features exhibited by the MIP, and, therefore, all these variables must be carefully studied in order to obtain maximum efficiency [83,84].

(p22.3) The template molecule must fulfill a set of requirements, namely it be chemically inert; remain stable at moderately elevated temperatures or upon to exposure to UV radiation; and it may not have groups that accelerate or retard polymerization (e.g., thiol) as well as polymerizable groups, since these promote the non-formation of recognition cavities. Furthermore, this component should be able to bond with the functional monomer otherwise there will be no printing [83].
