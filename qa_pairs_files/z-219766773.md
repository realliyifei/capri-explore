## (s1) Impacts of climate change to mangrove ecosystems
(p1.0) Climate change is expected to affect mangroves and intensify their existing pressures. Changes in sealevel, temperature, atmospheric CO2, precipitation patterns, intensity of storms, ocean circulation patterns are predicted to impact this ecosystem, where relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat [19], [20], [21], [22].
## (s2) Sea-level rise
(p2.0) Sea-level rise is the greatest potential threat of climate change that not only will affect millions of people but also mangrove ecosystems [22]. Recent study using Coastal DEM indicates that under high emissions, 630 million people will be living on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100 [23]. This study also reports that 70% of the total people worldwide living in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan, would be exposed to sea-level rise and annual storm surges [23].

(p2.1) Sea-level rise will affect salinity that surpasses their tolerance threshold and inundation duration and frequency [3], [22]. As mangroves are halophytes, salinity changes could impact propagules growth and alter the species composition [3].Studies have reported the increase of coastal flooding in the future due to sea-level rise which are likely to increase by 0.28 and 0.98 m by 2100 [24]. Increases in inundation due to long term flooding may also lead to plant death and species composition shifts [3], [20]. Sea-level rise will lead to a gradual decline for some mangrove areas, survival of individual trees to local extirpation [20].
## (s3) Atmospheric CO2 concentration
(p3.0) Net CO2 emissions of 5.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr -1 has been estimated to derive from land use and land-use change during 2007-2016 (IPCC, 2019). These net emissions are mostly due to deforestation, partly offset by afforestation/reforestation, and emissions and removals by other land use activities [24].
## (s4) Temperature
(p4.0) From 1850-1900 to 2006-2015 the mean land surface air temperature increased by 1.53°C, while the global mean surface temperature (land and ocean) increased by 0.87°C [24]. The increased frequency, intensity and duration of heat-related events, and the increased heavy precipitation are the result of global warming.
## (s5) Storms
(p5.0) Storms and extreme weather events have been predicted to increase in intensity and frequency [24]. The impact of storms is proportional to their strength, frequency, size and duration. Hurricanes and cyclones can impact mangroves by uprooting trees, breaking branches and defoliating their canopy [22]. Extreme storms can lead to complete large-scale mangrove mortality and increase stress due to peat collapse and rapid decreases in soil elevation [30]. Mangrove sediment elevation could be altered by storms through soil erosion, soil deposition, peat collapse, and soil compression [30], [20]. Mass mangrove mortality with little survival of saplings and tress could lead to permanent ecosystem conversion as recovery that might be hindered due to sediment elevation and hydrology changes [30].
