## (s1) PHYSICOCHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS OF PUMPKIN SEEDS
(p1.0) The different species of pumpkin seeds exerts the different components and biological activities (Caili, et al., 2006).Many researchers studied the bioactive compositions of pumpkin seeds oil that grown in the different areas of the world.Due to the differences among the species and/or varieties of Cucurbita spp., the yield of fatty acids, sterols or phytoestrogens and tocopherols was quite similar to those of each other and belong to the three major components of pumpkin seeds that have been focused by many studies.However, the minor components of pumpkin seeds such as protein, mineral, terpenic alcohol, and fiber also could not be ignored, because they have played role in the synergistic positive effects of pumpkin seeds (Fu, et al., 2006).Some technologies are applied to isolate the higher yield of oil from crude pumpkin seeds.Although several studies reported that crude pumpkin seeds extract itself exhibited the broad-spectrum pharmacological effects through in vitro, in vivo and human trial.
