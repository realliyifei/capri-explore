## (s5) Discussion
(p5.0) The obturation materials must meet many criteria including sealing and biocompatibility; the material must also remain inert over time. However, in certain clinical situations such as endodontic retreatments, they should be easily removable and soluble with chemical solvents [16][17][18][19][20].

(p5.1) GP is the most commonly used obturation material and its excellent properties have made it the "gold standard" for root canal filling. However, removal of this material during retreatment is not always satisfactory, which can cause operative difficulties as well as biological problems [12,[21][22][23]. RS was introduced as an alternative filling material for root canals. Additionally, it is biocompatible and has improved adhesive ad sealing properties because of its polymeric nature.
