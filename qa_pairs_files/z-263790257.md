## (s6) Minimum convex polygon (MCP) or convex hull
(p6.0) The convex hull of a sample of points is the minimum convex set enclosing them all, yielding a polygon connecting the outermost points in the sample and all whose inner angles are less than 180 • .This is the simplest method for constructing home ranges and computing their areas and it has been widely employed for a long time, even until recently.

(p6.1) A variant of the MCP home range estimator is obtained by removing the proportion α of the sample points farthest from the sample centroid.More generally, Bath et al. (2006) compare the MCP home range after applying different criteria to "peel" individual observations from the sample of locations: they remove points farthest from the centroid or from the harmonic mean or those with a great influence on the area of the home range.
## (s10) Local convex hull (LoCoH) or k-nearest neighbor convex hulls (k-NNCH)
(p10.0) This is a localized version of the MCP.For a fixed integer k > 0, Getz and Wilmers (2004) construct the convex hull, k-NNCH i , of each sample point x i and its k − 1 nearest neighbors (NN) (with respect to the Euclidean metric, although other metrics could be employed).Then these hulls are ordered according to their area, from smallest to largest.The LoCoH home range estimate is the isopleth that results of progressively taking the union of the hulls from the smallest upwards, until a specific percentage (e.g., 95%) of sample points is included.Getz et al. (2007) extend the original LoCoH procedure (called k-LoCoH) to the r-LoCoH (where a fixed sphere of influence was used instead of the k nearest neighbours) and to the a-LoCoH (the a standing for adaptive sphere of influence).A detailed study of the theoretical properties and finite sample performance of the r-LoCoH can be found in Aaron and Bodart (2016).
## (s11) Characteristic hull polygon (CHP)
(p11.0) As the LoCoH, the characteristic hull polygon (Downs and Horner 2009) is a union of convex sets and a generalization of the MCP.First, the Delaunay triangulation of the sample of locations is constructed.Then, the largest 5% of the triangles are removed, where the size of the triangle is measured by its perimeter.As Downs and Horner (2009) point out, it would be interesting that the proportion of triangles to remove should somehow depend on the actual shape of the real home range (for instance, this proportion should be 0 for convex domains).

(p11.1) The package adehabitatHR is the only one implementing the CHP in R, but it measures the size of the triangles by their area.We have modified the CharHull function from adehabitatHR to compute the perimeter of the Delaunay triangles and remove the 5% with largest boundary (see Figure 8).We see that this estimator resembles the LoCoH with k = 35.As a home range, the CHP is unsatisfactory, since it includes several slivers corresponding to seldom visited locations, and, in particular, this produces two surprising holes that do not seem reasonable for the home range (by visual inspection of the sample shape and taking into account the geography of the terrain).

(p11.2) Single-linkage cluster Kenward et al. (2001) proposed yet another localized variant of the MCP.The difference with the LoCoH lies in the way that local neighbourhoods are constructed.Their proposal starts from the nearest-neighbour distances between locations, these distances are clustered using single-linkage cluster analysis, aiming to minimize the mean joining distance and imposing a certain minimum cluster size.Once the locations are grouped in clusters, the convex hull (or the minimum area polygon) of each cluster is computed and the final home range is defined as the union of these polygons.

(p11.3) The single-linkage cluster home range of Zimzik locations data appears in Figure 9, produced using the package adehabitatHR.The method identified two larger clusters of locations, and several other smaller clusters, and obtained the final home range estimate by gathering together the convex hulls of each of the 450000 500000 550000 600000 650000 700000 4950000 5000000 5050000 5100000 q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qqq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q qq q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q qqq q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qqq q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q qq q q q q q q q q q Figure 8: Characteristic hull polygon for Zimzik locations.

## (s14) Time Geography Density Estimation (TGDE)
(p14.0) Time geography is a perspective of social geography introduced by Hägerstrand (1970).It analyzes human phenomena (transportation, socio-economic systems,. . . ) in a geographic space taking into account the restrictions and trade-offs in human spatial behaviour imposed by individual activity schedules (see Miller 2005).

(p14.1) An important concept in time geography is the space-time prism, which bounds all possible space-time paths between two observed locations x i and x i+1 at consecutive time points, taking into account the accessibility constraints of the individual (see Figure 10).The geo-ellipse g i or potential path area (PPA) of these two consecutive locations delineates in the geographic space all points that the individual can potentially reach during the time interval [t i , t i+1 ]:

(p14.2) where v i denotes the maximum velocity in the time interval.Figure 10: Space-time prism and geoellipse g i corresponding to consecutive locations x i and x i+1 , observed at times t i and t i+1 respectively.Downs (2010) and Downs et al. (2011) propose to integrate KDE and time geography techniques by using the geo-ellipses derived from location pairs as surrogates for the KDE level sets.Downs (2010) claims that a drawback of KDE home range estimation is that it includes areas where the individual could not have been located, given the spatial and temporal constraints established by the observed locations and the maximum potential velocity.As an alternative, if the maximum interval velocities v i are all assumed to be equal to some global maximum velocity v, then the time-geographic density estimate at a point x is defined as fTG

(p14.3) where G is a decreasing function playing the role of the kernel.Given that G is maximal at zero, the individual summands of the estimator (3) assign the highest probability to the points along the straight path between two consecutively observed locations and spread out the remaining probability mass in ellipsoidal contours having the observed locations as their foci.The velocity v plays the role of the smoothing parameter and, as such, it is reasonable to derive its value from the animal locations and their corresponding observation times (see Long and Nelson 2012).The TGDE home range is the 95% level set, { fTG ≥ ĉ0.05 }, of the density estimate given in (3), where

(p14.4) In parallel, Long and Nelson (2012) defined the PPA home range as the union of the n − 1 geo-ellipses obtained from all the pairs of consecutive locations in the sample:

(p14.5) with v i = v, for all i = 1, . . ., n − 1.The estimator ( 4) is a particular case of the TGDE home range { fTG ≥ ĉ0.05 } with a uniform kernel G. Long and Nelson (2015) introduce the dynamic PPA home range (dynPPA), an adaptation of the PPA estimator to possibly different motion states.It is obtained by allowing the mobility parameter v to change over time.In practice, these authors divide the trajectory of the animal in dynamic phases and obtain an estimator of v in each of them.

(p14.6) The PPA home range and the TGDE are implemented in the R package wildlifeTG (Long 2017).In Figure 11 we show both home range estimators for the Zimzik locations data, where the function G is Gaussian-like (i.e., proportional to e −x 2 /2 ) for the TGDE in (b).The PPA home range represents, in a sense, an upper bound of the home range since it clearly overestimates it by including all the locations that the animal could have reached if it had moved from each of the observed locations at a certain speed.TGDE is clearly the most satisfactory of the two, although it comprises many seldom visited areas.450000 500000 550000 600000 650000 700000 4950000 5000000 5050000 5100000 q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q

(p15.0) There have been various attempts to generalize the kernel home range estimator to incorporate the time dependence between the observed locations.Nevertheless, there are two important issues that should be remarked: first, the definition of the kernel density estimator for dependent data is exactly the same as for independent data, and second, regarding the fundamental problem of bandwidth selection, the data can be treated as if they were independent, since the asymptotically optimal bandwidth for independent data is also optimal under quite general conditions of dependence, as shown in Hall et al. (1995).This means that, to design methods to estimate the utilization distribution density, we can proceed exactly the same as for independent data.Keating and Cherry (2009) suggested a product kernel density estimator where time was incorporated as an extra variable to the two-dimensional location vector, thus yielding three-dimensional observations.This approach does not seem appropriate, since time is not a random variable whose frequency we want to analyze, as we noted at the beginning of Section 2.2.

(p15.1) In the context of estimating the active utilization distribution (describing space frequency use in the active moments of the animal), Benhamou and Cornelis ( 2010) developed the movement-based kernel density estimation (MKDE) method.MKDE consists in dividing each step or time interval [t i , t i+1 ] into several sub-steps, that is, adding new points at regular intervals on each step.Then KDE is carried out on the known and the interpolated relocations with a variable one-dimensional smoothing parameter h i (t).For each time interval h i is a smooth function of the time lapse from t i and to t i+1 , taking its smallest value h min at the end points and the largest (at most h max ) at the midpoint.A drawback of MKDE is that it depends, thus, on the choice of several parameters, such as h min , h max and the length of the subintervals.For instance, using package adehabitatHR, in Figure 12 we have plotted the MKDE home ranges for two very different values of h min but equal values of the rest of parameters: clearly, the choice of this smoothing parameter can substantially alter the resulting home range.Optimal simultaneous selection of all the parameters of MKDE with respect to some criterion is computationally unfeasible even for moderate sample sizes.A second concern regarding MKDE is that it is not clear whether the resulting home range differs substantially from the KDE based on the independence assumption.
## (s17) T-LoCoH
(p17.0) T-LoCoH (Lyons et al. 2013) generalizes the LoCoH home range to incorporate the observation times of the relocations.T-LoCoH incorporates the time associated to each location in two phases of the LoCoH algorithm: nearest neighbour selection and the ranking of hulls.First, the NN selection relies on the so-called time-scaled distance (TSD), which transforms the time coordinate into a third one of Euclidean space R 3 .Specifically, the TSD between two sample points, (t i , x i ) and (t j , x j ), is defined as

(p17.1) where s ≥ 0 is a scaling factor of the maximum theoretical velocity v max .Finally, to construct the isopleths, local hulls are sorted according to a hull metric, chosen to reflect the spatial or time information we might want to use.Dougherty et al. (2017) suggest a cross-validation procedure to select the tuning parameters k and s for the T-LoCoH.Following the indications in Lyons et al. (2013), with the aid of the graphical procedures available in the package tlocoh, we have chosen the values of s = 0.05 and k = 40 as T-LoCoH parameters for Zimzik locations.The value of v max was internally chosen by R. Figure 13 displays the resulting T-LoCoH home range.We notice that, in this case, there is not such a big difference between the LoCoH homerange (Figure 7) and the T-LoCoH one, probably due to the small value of the parameter s.
