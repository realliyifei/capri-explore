## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Recently, the expansion of drug-resistant pathogens has created demand for novel antimicrobials and stimulated the search for natural plant-based compounds as alternatives to synthetics [1][2][3].Plants are a promising source of antimicrobial compounds: tannins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, essential oils, saponins, alkaloids, etc. Particular attention is paid to polyphenols due to the high diversity in their chemical structure and different mechanisms of activity.Therefore, polyphenol-rich species have been studied in search of new antimicrobials.In the last decade, the chemistry and biological activity of Epilobium angustifolium and related species have been studied intensively [4][5][6][7][8].
