## (s1) Driving forces and challenges for the development of AC/DC hybrid smart microgrids
(p1.0) The integration of DC systems in AC-based infrastructures provides a new framework of grid capabilities [9]. As it is foreseen, DC solutions need to "harmoniously co-exist" with the already available AC infrastructures, developing hybrid architectures in which the best result of both approaches can be achieved [10].

(p1.1) In this manner, AC/DC hybrid smart microgrids bring a new perspective into a variety of applications [11]. As opposed to the traditional AC infrastructures, some of their main advantages include:
## (s3) Challenges regarding AC/DC hybrid smart microgrids
(p3.0) Several developments regarding AC/DC hybrid smart microgrids have taken place over the past few years, with fruitful results presented in the worldwide literature. Although, their effectiveness in certain applications is evident and generally accepted by the research community, there is several factors that inhibit their wide deployment, as presented in Figure 6 [47].
