## (s8) Overview of Wind Instrumentation and Measurement
(p8.0) Currently, the wind energy industry is facing an inaccuracy prediction risk, which is a threat to the entire industry.Global estimates indicate that wind farms are 10% worse than the pre-building energy efficiency estimates in all regions [61,62].Wind farm best location choice is the first significant step in physical advancement [63].Wind energy assessment report commonly referred to as a "bank report which attracts and influences the decision of investors to invest in this project."Usually, these bank reports need a rigorous valuation of wind conditions within 12 months before the investment.Industry experts suggest that the presence of wind measurement technology in-ground facilities is not a task to provide sufficient data or to accurately assess the potential of wind resources at a given location.It is partly due to the lower air pressure of the extracted wind direction and speed data, and the incapability of fully considering existing turbulence technologies.

## (s20) Hybrid Methods
(p20.0) Numerous sets of hybrid models are installed to estimate wind energy [96].The nature of the combined model can be (i) statistical, and physical approaches of the mix, (ii) short-medium range approaches, (iii) alternative statistical approaches in combination.The goal of the hybrid approach is to benefit from each method and gain the best predictive performance, globally.For example, in the autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX), more than a few statistical approaches are managed to determine the best results between online measurements and weather forecasts.Generally, system participants can be compared by the history of predictions through actual available output data to track the wind performance of prediction measurement tools.It is essential to evaluate the performance of models related to several criteria, especially the use of RMSE and IEA predictions [97,98].Figure 7 depicts the variation of wind speed over time (hours), while Figure 8 illustrates the atmospheric effects on the wind-based doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), producing energy and related control schemes for a sustainable system.Sustainability 2020, 12, x; doi: FOR PEER REVIEW www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilityoutput data to track the wind performance of prediction measurement tools.It is essential to evaluate the performance of models related to several criteria, especially the use of RMSE and IEA predictions [97,98].Figure 7 depicts the variation of wind speed over time (hours), while Figure 8 illustrates the atmospheric effects on the wind-based doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), producing energy and related control schemes for a sustainable system.
## (s24) The ANN Prolific in Wind Power Generation Forecasting
(p24.0) Artificial neural networks are extensively used in many areas of application.One of the most popular is prediction, which is described as a process of predicting future trends or events.Besides, forecasts in a variety of areas, such as the prediction of weather, asset prices, and economic downturn forecasts, are fairly common [31,116].It is essential to emphasize that the predictions do not start with artificial neural networks since traditionally, many analysis tools have been used to predict future trends.Examples of algorithms are the Box-Jenkins model and the regression model.However, the use of artificial neural networks as an essential prediction tool is increasing.A neural network is an information method with which the relationships between different data can track and determined internally.Also, academic and industrial researchers have used ANN for a variety of predictive purposes, as it can compare self-study mechanisms between expected and actual results.The artificial neural network can teach itself, and its weighting factors can be adjusted to reduce future errors between the prediction results and the actual results, which facilitates its extensive application in prediction.
