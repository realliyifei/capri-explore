## (s3) Preprocessing of mammography images based on traditional machine learning
(p3.0) Image preprocessing is essential due to the challenges encountered in diagnosing mammography images of early breast cancer, including small and irregular calcification points, diverse Flow diagram of identification of researches included in the review. Mammography image preprocessing primarily aims to remove irrelevant information and noise, while retaining relevant and useful information (33). Continuous advancements in mammography technology have led to significant improvements in picture quality, resulting in reduced noise levels. Due to the similarity between noise and early calcification points, there is a risk of misjudgment during the noise removal process, leading to instances where the noise is not completely eliminated. Given the similarity in grayscale between pectoral muscles and masses, it becomes necessary to normalize the image or enhance contrast to mitigate disturbances caused by the presence of pectoral muscles. Hence, pretreatment plays a vital role in accentuating features, enhancing feature contrast, and improving the reliability of subsequent processing steps.
## (s4) Lesion detection of mammogram images based on traditional machine learning
(p4.0) Breast cancer originates from the aberrant proliferation of cells in breast tissue, resulting in the development of diverse lesion types, such as asymmetry between the left and right breasts, tissue structure distortion, and the presence of microcalcifications (MCs) and lumps in varying sizes and shapes (34). Breast masses and microcalcifications are prevalent types of lesions encountered in clinical practice. MCs are small calcium deposits commonly found in the breast, appearing as bright spots on mammograms (35). While individual MCs are not highly indicative of breast cancer detection, the formation of microcalcification clusters through the aggregation of microcalcifications serves as an important early sign of breast cancer. Microcalcification clusters, consisting of three or more calcification points per centimeter, can lead to a preliminary diagnosis of early breast cancer. Thus, the detection of microcalcification clusters holds significant value in the early examination of breast cancer. Lumps typically manifest as relatively dense areas (off-white areas) on mammograms. Benign lumps exhibit a round, smooth, and well-circumscribed appearance, while suspicious lumps display irregular, rough, and blurred borders (35).
## (s5) Microcalcification lesion detection
(p5.0) Duarte et al. (36) demonstrated a technique for segmenting microcalcifications by combining geodesic active profiles with anisotropic texture filtering. The images undergo preprocessing through Alternating Sequential Filtering, and contrast enhancement is achieved using Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technology. The image set utilized in the system is extracted from the DDSM database. This technique achieved an average area overlap measurement of 0.52 Â± 0.20, encompassing 87.4% of malignant cases and 86.4% of benign cases. Guo (37) et al. described a system for detecting microcalcified clusters present in digital mammogram images. The zone growth method was employed to eliminate artifacts in mammal X images. The top hat transform and grayscale adjustment methods are utilized for contrast enhancement. The contourlet transform is employed to identify suspicious regions in the breast X image. Calcified clusters are detected using unlinked pulse-coupled neural networks. The proposed system achieved a good accuracy of 95.8%, sensitivity of 96.3%, and specificity of 94.7% when tested on the MIAS and JSMIT databases, respectively. In the (38) study, the researchers proposed a CAD system for mammography microcalcification detection based on a new feature set. They employed statistical observations of classical features (such as higher-order statistics, discrete wavelet Workflow of computer-aided diagnosis of mammographic images. Recently, the detection of microcalcification points in mammography has gained significant attention as a challenging research area. Despite numerous methods proposed for detecting microcalcification points. However, due to the complex structure of mammography X-ray images, uneven background, and the presence of noise similar to microcalcifications, the detection of microcalcification points still poses certain challenges. Current methods have not yielded satisfactory results, with routine examinations missing 10-30% of cases (41). Hence, researchers should prioritize the development of new technologies to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting microcalcification points in the breast. Additionally, most studies continue to rely on breast image databases from Europe and North America, resulting in a limited number of studies focused on dense mammary X-ray images. Furthermore, there is currently no standardized breast image database suitable for Asian women researchers. Therefore, establishing a standardized breast image database specifically tailored for Asia is an urgent concern.
## (s11) Application of deep learning in mammography
(p11.0) The continuous development and optimization of DL models and algorithms have significantly expanded the application of DL in mammography image analysis (56). Table 2 presents a compilation of state-of-the-art mammography imaging methods that employ DL techniques   Additionally, they employed the Convolutional Block Attention Module to enhance the feature expression ability of the network. Finally, the characteristics of multi-scale image patches were fused to achieve the classification of benign and malignant breast masses.
## (s15) Conclusion based on deep learning
(p15.0) The rapid development of DL and the significant improvement in computer performance have made DL a prominent research area for analyzing and processing medical images to aid in lesion diagnosis. Traditional computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems lack deep networks and can only extract shallow features, resulting in poor system performance. DL, on the other hand, can automatically extract informative features from medical images, including those that may not be easily visible to the naked eye. This capability greatly enhances the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in the context of breast lesion diagnosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that DL applied to breast cancer screening is approaching the diagnostic proficiency of experienced radiologists (81).. However, the challenge of relying on ROI annotation in DL techniques has yet to be effectively addressed. Therefore, further research should be conducted to explore DL techniques that reduce the dependency on ROI annotation. However, the challenge of relying on ROI annotation in DL techniques has yet to be effectively addressed. Therefore, further research should be conducted to explore DL techniques that reduce the dependency on ROI annotation. Some researchers (82,83) have employed various DL techniques to detect and classify suspicious areas in mammography images, resulting in improved model performance to some extent. Moreover, considering that DL training and validation sets require extensive data, the creation of a large publicly available dataset with high accuracy, resolution, and diversity becomes necessary. This dataset will facilitate the training of CAD models with superior performance. Consequently, the integration of DL into mammography CAD systems represents a promising direction for advancing computer-aided diagnosis technology for mammography images.
## (s16) Discussion
(p16.0) Mammography is a widely used method for early diagnosis of breast cancer. It offers high-resolution X-ray images that enable the visualization of different layers of breast tissue. This technique is effective in detecting breast hyperplasia, benign and malignant tumors, as well as disorders in breast tissue structure (84). Additionally, mammography provides clear images that facilitate before-and-after comparisons, making it highly significant for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This narrative review provides an analysis and discussion on the current state of computed breast diagnosis technology, encompassing both traditional ML methods and DL. Firstly, the paper introduces the definition and fundamental theoretical knowledge of ML and DL. It then explores the research on the application of traditional ML techniques in mammography, including preprocessing, feature extraction, lesion segmentation, and benign and malignant classification. Subsequently, the paper delves into the application of DL in mammography, covering lesion detection, segmentation, and classification, while briefly outlining the advantages and disadvantages of DL. Despite the deepening of research on computer diagnosis of breast cancer, there are still many challenges:

(p16.1) (1) The available sample data for glandular structure distortion and asymmetric dense shadow is limited and lacks standardization. Currently, most research focuses on mass and microcalcification detection, neglecting the investigation of glandular structure distortion and asymmetric dense effects. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to prioritize the development of models for detecting multiple lesions and creating automated tools for identifying glandular structure distortion and asymmetric dense effects.

(p16.2) (2) The variability in shapes and edges of suspicious lesions, along with the blurred boundary between the lesion and the surrounding tissues, results in unstable lesion depiction and increases the risk of misdiagnosis. Although ML-assisted breast diagnosis has significantly improved accuracy, establishing a stable lesion identification system and implementing it on a large scale remain challenging research areas. Therefore, there is a need for further improvements in techniques for automated detection and segmentation of breast lesions in mammograms.
## (s17) Conclusion
(p17.0) Breast cancer poses a significant threat to women's health and mortality, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment. Mammograms serve as a highly effective and reliable tool for timely identification and diagnosis of breast cancer (86). CAD systems built on mammography have aided doctors in decisionmaking and reduced diagnostic errors to some extent, traditional ML-based CAD systems encounter challenges in terms of limited generalization ability, inadequate automation, continued reliance on manual intervention, and a high demand for operators possessing specialized domain knowledge and engineering skills. However, with the advancement of DL research, DL-based CAD systems emerge as a viable solution to address these issues effectively, significantly enhancing the efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.
