## (s1) Coaching and guidance: definitions
(p1.0) Coaching is defined as the provision of support by a trained individual (either in person or remotely-for example by telephone or Internet), who is supportive but non-directive, for a patient or family facing a decision [3]. Using an iterative verbal exchange, elements of coaching include: a) assessing the patients' decision-making needs; b) providing information on their options, benefits, and harms (e.g., verbally or with patient education resources such as PtDAs); c) verifying their understanding; d) clarifying their values associated with the attributes of the options, and their attitude toward risks; e) building their skills in deliberating, communicating, and accessing support; f) screening for barriers to implementation; and g) facilitating progress in decision making [4]. Although the patient may express their leaning toward a specific option to the decision coach, agreeing upon an option occurs during consultation with the practitioner rather than with the coach. Trained health professionals, students, or laypeople can provide coaching before and/or after using a PtDA, as part of its delivery, or in the absence of PtDAs. Coaching may also be referred to as decision support, counselling, navigation, and/or facilitation of the decision-making processes.

(p1.1) Guidance is defined as an explicit element embedded within the decision support materials that can facilitate a self-directed approach to the process of decision making. It can be included within the PtDA or as a resource used alongside the PtDA. Examples of elements used to provide guidance include: a) a list of steps or systematic approach for making a decision; b) a worksheet to help patients to clarify their values associated with the options' attributes that can be shared with their practitioner; c) a list of questions and/or an invitation for users to identify questions to ask the practitioner (or decision coach); and/or d) an automated summary of the patients' priorities and decisional needs (e.g., their knowledge, values, preference, the results of decision analysis) that can be given to the patient and shared with the practitioner(s), decision coach, and/or significant others involved in the decision.
## (s3) Achieving higher quality decisions
(p3.0) The objective of patient-oriented decision support is to help patients make higher quality decisions that are informed with the best available evidence and that reflect the patients' values for the options' attributes [6,7]. The main hypothesis underlying the use of guidance and coaching within or alongside PtDAs is that: a) since patients are better able to participate in making decisions about their healthcare and to achieve a higher quality decision if they are supported in the process of thinking about a decision and discussing it with others, and b) since coaching and guidance may provide that support, by improving patients' deliberation and communication skills, improving follow-through on a chosen option, and managing patients' emotional distress, then c) coaching and guidance may help patients make higher quality decisions. See Table 1.
## (s9) Empirical evidence from studies of PtDAs
(p9.0) The following evidence summary for coaching/guidance is based on findings from the Cochrane Collaboration Review of PtDAs, which included randomized controlled trials published to the end of 2009 (N = 86) [43], as well as from an updated search of PtDA trials published to the end of 2010 (N = 12). For decision coaching, we also used a sub-analysis of trials that evaluated decision coaching within trials of PtDAs [4]. This sub-analysis a) included trials that allowed the impact of decision coaching provided by a healthcare professional to be compared to another intervention and/or usual care, and b) excluded trials in which patients were exposed to coaching in both arms of the trial [45][46][47][48]. One other trial was excluded because only 12 of 136 women (8.8%) in the intervention group were exposed to decision coaching [49]. In this single study in which decision coaching was optional, few women initiated contact with the coach or accepted coach-initiated contact. These authors surmised that women in this study may have opted out of coaching because they did not perceive, prospectively, any added value compared to just using the decision guide [49].
## (s10) Evidence about decision coaching
(p10.0) Of 98 trials of PtDAs, 11 (11.2%) included decision coaching provided by nurses, genetic counsellors, pharmacist, physicians (who were not the primary practitioner for the patient), psychologists, or health educators. Table 3 summarizes the findings from trials that evaluated decision coaching. A PtDA plus decision coaching compared to usual care improved knowledge and decreased mean costs [4]. Compared to baseline, both coaching alone and the PtDA alone improved knowledge, but there was no statistically significant difference in knowledge between groups. The impact of comparisons on other outcomes was more variable, with some trials showing positive effects (e.g., participation in decision making, satisfaction, actual choice) and other trials reporting no differences (e.g., participation in decision making, satisfaction, actual choice, values-choice agreement, decisional conflict, adherence, anxiety). Overall, none of these outcomes were worse when patients were exposed to decision coaching.
## (s11) Evidence about guidance
(p11.0) Among 98 randomized controlled trials, 63 (64.3%) used PtDAs that contained some sort of explicit guidance in deliberation and/or communication. Examples of PtDAs  that did not provide explicit guidance used simple paper-based consent formats [50,51] or computer-based programs with conjoint analysis [52]. The amount of guidance varied considerably. Table 4 summarizes the types of guidance provided (these are not mutually exclusive). Only one trial of PtDAs compared guidance provided by different individuals [43]. In this trial, findings revealed that, compared to the same PtDA administered by a research assistant prior to the consultation, a PtDA administered by the physician during the consultation showed a non-statistically significant trend of higher acceptability of the PtDA and lower decisional conflict [53]. Given that more detailed PtDAs are more likely to include one or more of these elements of guidance in deliberation or communication, we also report evidence comparing simple to detailed PtDAs. Compared to simpler PtDAs, more detailed PtDAs produced higher gains in knowledge, more realistic expectations, and a greater match between patients' values and their chosen option [43]. However, the link between detailed PtDAs, explicit guidance, and effectiveness needs to be tested empirically.
## (s16) 42
(p16.0) For more information, see " Table of Characteristics of Included Studies" in the Cochrane Collaboration Review of Patient Decision Aids [43] definitional, theoretical, and evidentiary basis for using coaching and guidance within or alongside PtDAs. We discuss these implications in the following text.
## (s19) Lack of empirical evidence to support coaching or guidance with PtDAs
(p19.0) More evaluative investigation is required to understand: a) the added effect of decision coaching beyond the PtDA; b) which population(s) could most benefit from decision coaching; c) who should deliver this intervention-a health professional or lay coaches; d) the effect of a coaching intervention that is tailored to the unique factors influencing patients' baseline decisional needs and/or their decision-making process; and e) the effect of coaching or guidance alone. Furthermore, when decision coaching is provided by healthcare professionals within a clinical setting, can its delivery be spread out among different members of the interprofessional team, or does one member of the team need to take responsibility for this role? Another area requiring further evaluation is the use of decision coaching in patients with chronic conditions in which the decision situation is revisited over time and/or there is a series of different decisions to be made [68].
