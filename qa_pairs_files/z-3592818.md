## (s2) Short-term effects in human subjects
(p2.0) The study which revitalised this recent interest in green tea's 'fat burning' applications in human subjects was carried out by Dulloo et al. (8) who wished to determine whether ingesting GTE (and thus the caffeine and polyphenols within) would increase 24 h EE in human subjects via the sympathetic nervous system, and whether the effects could be explained by the caffeine content alone.The study, on healthy young men, measured respiratory quotients (RQ), 24 h EE and urinary excretion of catecholamines and N within a respiratory chamber during three separate 24 h periods.The authors administered one of three treatments: GTE (50 mg caffeine, 90 mg EGCG, plus other catechins); caffeine (50 mg); or a placebo.The total catechin content ingested per capsule was 125 mg.

(p2.1) The authors found that compared with a placebo, the GTE elicited a statistically significant 4 % increase in 24 h EE, coupled with a decrease in the RQ of 0•88-0•85, indicating an increase in fuel oxidation, with a shift from carbohydrate to fat.They found no change in N within urine samples, and an increase in urinary noradrenaline in the GTE group.Treatment with caffeine alone (50 mg) exhibited no effect on EE, RQ or urinary excretion of N or catecholamines.The authors concluded that the 4 % increase was directly attributable to thermogenesis stimulated by GTE, arguing that unchanged N excretion indicated no increase in protein oxidation, and that the decrease in RQ indicated a shift in substrate metabolism from carbohydrate to fat.The results using caffeine suggested that it alone could not explain the effects but acted synergistically with the polyphenols.Subsequent to this publication, a number of other studies have been conducted on both human subjects and animals to investigate such observations, with some inconsistent results (Tables 2 -4).
## (s3) Long-term effects in human subjects
(p3.0) Long-term effects on body weight were also demonstrated in obese subjects using a catechin-rich GTE (AR25 Exolise), with a dosage of 374 mg/d (270 mg of which was EGCG) (21) .Over 3 months, a 4•6 % drop in weight and a 4•5 % reduction in waist circumference were reported, though it should be noted that the experimental design was an open study and as such vulnerable to confounding influences.Similar, yet less extensive, results in other studies over a similar time frame have since been published.A study on obese Thai men and women, for instance, reported a 3•8 % drop in body fat percentage with an associated drop of 2•7 kg in body weight (24) .These results were obtained using a GTE dosage of 750 mg/d of which 142 mg were catechins.Wang et al. (25) recently demonstrated a drop in body weight and body fat percentage.They administered one of two nonplacebo treatments (458 mg/d GTE þ 104 mg caffeine, or 886 mg/d GTE þ 198 mg caffeine), and reported a maximum drop of 1•2 kg in weight and 0•6 % in body fat.
## (s4) Animal models
(p4.0) A number of useful experiments in animal models have also lent some credence to the role of catechins in weight modulation (Table 4).Murase et al. (33) studied the effect of GTE on running endurance and energy metabolism.The experiment utilised four groups of BALB/c mice: two controls (one with exercise, one without), a group on 0•2 % GTE and a group on 0•5 % GTE.The measured variables included: treadmill exhaustion times, plasma biochemical parameters, skeletal muscle glycogen, b-oxidation and malonyl-CoA content immediately after exercise at 8 -10 weeks.pen study Obese males/females 3 months 374 mg/d (270 mg EGCG) 4•6 % drop in weight, 4•48 % drop in waist circumference Kajimoto et al. (22) Randomised, placebo- * These studies were obtained via a systematic search of Scopus, using a combination of the following key terms: 'EGCG', 'epigallocatechin gallate', 'energy expenditure', 'green tea', 'tea catechins' and 'tea polyphenols'.Of the papers retrieved, studies were then selected based on utilisation of an intervention-based study design using green tea or GTE with end-points based on body weight, BF, endurance or EE in human participants.They were further categorised based on intervention duration (. 1 week).
## (s5) Evaluating the evidence
(p5.0) The utilisation of green tea would only be of interest, however, provided the findings discussed thus far are actually valid and reliable, and in this regard, it is important to decide just how reliable both the paradigms adopted and the findings reported really are.The first issue is perhaps the biggest, and is simply the difficulty in arriving at a coherent consensus mode of action by which green tea might perpetrate the effects that we have described.While mechanisms as put forward by Dulloo and colleagues have some popularity behind them, there is still scepticism within the field as to just how much of an effect such a mechanism might truly account for.Studies in postmenopausal women, for instance, found no significant change in waist circumference, total body fat or abdominal fat after a 12-week regimen with an EGCG dosage of 300 mg/d, suggesting that while it might help with general health in moderate doses, a higher intake might be required (20) .

(p5.1) Another limitation of many of these studies is the manner in which the GTE is administered.The current method is often administration in a pill form, with high doses of catechins often in the region of 600 mg/d.A paper by Wu & Wei (2) , however, suggests that the estimated content of EGCG in a 'cup' of green tea is approximately 90 mg, implying that to achieve the dosage obtained in such studies, one would have to drink nearly seven cups a day.Such methodology might not therefore be physiologically or socially relevant, given the social preference of beverage consumption over pills.
## (s9) Lipid-metabolising enzymes
(p9.0) Green tea has also been shown to act on the expression of lipid-metabolising enzymes such as acetyl-CoA oxidase, and acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase.The expression of these enzymes is controlled by PPAR.While catechins have been shown not to act as ligands to PPAR (33,66) , they have been shown to inhibit NF-kB.NF-kB is known to inhibit PPARa activation of the PPAR response element promoter.Consequently, it has been suggested that catechin-mediated suppression of NF-kB might relieve the inhibition on the response element promoter and so up-regulate the expression of lipid-metabolising enzymes.This in turn is a suggested contributory factor in the reported observations of green tea on fat metabolism.
## (s10) Lipogenic enzymes
(p10.0) Green tea inhibits a number of lipogenic enzymes, including glucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ACC and, in particular, FAS (67) .Current in vitro evidence suggests that catechins effect the suppression of FAS activity in two ways: by direct inhibition of the enzyme and through down-regulating the expression of the protein.Direct inhibition occurs, firstly through rapid, reversible binding with or near the NADPHbinding site of the b-ketoacyl reductase component of FAS.Following this, the gallate ester groups interacts with an alternate region of the b-ketoacyl reductase leading to irreversible loss of activity, with Wang and colleagues reporting the halfmaximal inhibitory concentration of EGCG in FAS inhibition as 5•2 £ 10 25 M (68,69) .Given that another component of FAS, enoyl reductase, also possesses an NADPH-binding site, if the NADPH site is the molecular target of gallate-catechin inhibition, this enzyme may also be a target in the inhibition of FAS.

(p10.1) Furthermore, catechins have also been implicated in the down-regulation of FAS gene expression, with evidence from experiments in cancer cell lines.Inhibitory actions have been demonstrated in a number of signal transduction pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt kinase pathway, and through the suppression of epidermal growth factor receptors (66) .Taken together, this comprehensive inhibition of FAS is another mechanism by which green tea has been argued to reduce fat mass, and suppress the accumulation of fat, an action that has been demonstrated in vivo in rats (38) .
## (s11) Adipocyte proliferation and differentiation
(p11.0) Catechins exert inhibitory actions on the proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytic cell lines.Differentiation is tightly controlled by several transcription factors, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins a/b/g and PPARg2 (the latter key in adipogenesis).PPARg and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein a in particular regulate differentiation of adipocytes.Levels of both factors are known to drop following the introduction of catechins into the cell system, thus placing a block on differentiation (66,72) .While unphosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 levels are unaffected, the active forms, phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, also drop along with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 in the presence of catechins (66,67,72) .Extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase are cell-cycle control kinases, crucial in adipocyte cell-cycle regulation.The inhibition of cyclindependent kinase 2, in particular, can arrest the cell cycle and thus also block proliferation.Given that a component of obesity inevitably includes both the hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes, a current explanation of fat reduction in those consuming green tea is this block on adipocyte maturation and proliferation.However, while such a molecular mechanism may play a part in long-term effects, it is unlikely to account for a significant portion of the effects seen in short-term studies, given the likely time required for such expression-based pathways to establish themselves.
## (s13) Glucose metabolism
(p13.0) In addition to the mechanisms already discussed, the upregulation of metabolic enzymes has been implicated (13,79) , with further suggestions that effects on fat metabolism with green tea catechins could also be mediated by changes in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

(p13.1) Green tea has been shown to promote glucose metabolism in human subjects at a dose of 1•5 g in oral glucose tolerance tests (4) (each participant was given 1•5 g of green tea infused in beverage form).Decreases in blood glucose levels in db þ/db þ diabetic mice without changes in serum insulin concentrations were observed, with suggestions that the effects might involve modulation of levels of a particular, uncharacterised serum protein with a mass of 4211 Da (4) .Given that a direct pathway via acetyl-CoA can lead to the formation of TAG, it is plausible that by decreasing blood glucose levels, and thus the amount of surplus glucose being stored as fat, a suppression of fat accumulation is possible this way.Such decreases in blood glucose levels following green tea administration have also been noted elsewhere (13) .Glucose uptake is known to increase in fat and muscle cells, via increased activity of GLUT4 transporters.Gluconeogenesis in the liver, however, decreases with catechin administration, along with decreased absorption in the intestine via Na-GLUT (67) .This mechanism might partially explain the anti-diabetic effects demonstrated by Tsuneki and colleagues.
## (s17) Dosage
(p17.0) However, a number of caveats to the utilisation of such an agent exist, the first of which is the likely dosage required.As many studies have inadvertently demonstrated, the intake of polyphenols seems to require a reasonably high dosage, often translating to five or more cups a day, although in countries such as Japan where intake is reported to be sometimes as high as ten cups a day or more (46) , this is perhaps less of a problem.Just how 'much' of an effect it has is another question entirely, with the range of results published, perhaps a consequence of the different doses and experimental designs employed, masking any clear quantal effect of the catechins used.
## (s18) Energy consumption
(p18.0) There also appears to be a greater efficacy observed where the catechins utilised possess galloyl moieties (22) .In addition to this, the efficacy of green tea in weight-loss programmes seems drastically inhibited if consumed while maintaining a very low-energy diet, whereas the ingestion of caffeine alone in such a diet will permit further weight loss relatively unhindered (29) .This effect may possibly be attributed to a reflex drop in sympathetic nervous system activity in a bid to protect the body's fuel stores in times of perceived famine (as an evolutionary biological imperative of our famine -feast food cycles).
## (s19) Caffeine intake
(p19.0) The effects are further affected by habitual caffeine intake.A lower effect has been observed in participants who routinely consume high doses of caffeine (above 300 mg/d), while those who are not habitual users experience a greater effect (31) .Given the suggestions of synergism by Dulloo and colleagues, such an observation would seem paradoxical.It may, however, be a result of caffeine tolerance in the high-caffeine groups, directly suppressing any synergism, which would then lend more support to Dulloo's suggestions.However, this may also demand further research to determine the magnitude of the influence.A recent meta-analysis reported that high, habitual caffeine impedance of GTE activity on weight maintenance following weight loss did not reach statistical significance, along with the role of ethnicity (84) .However, the same authors did consider both moderators, based on their results.
## (s20) Polymorphisms
(p20.0) Polymorphisms associated with the actions of caffeine might influence the efficacy of GTE -caffeine mixtures.Caffeine is metabolised by cytochrome P450 1A2, coded for by the CYP1A2 gene, while the stimulatory actions of caffeine are mediated at the adenosine A2A receptor coded for by the ADORA2A gene.The latter gene is known to be associated with caffeine intake, depending on the allele present (TT or C).Those with the ADORA2A TT genotype were more likely to be associated with a lower caffeine intake than the C genotype, and may be more sensitive to low doses of caffeine than to high doses (84,85) .Such variation between populations might influence the biological activity of GTE -caffeine mixtures.

(p20.1) Polymorphisms in the genes coding for COMT have also been shown to demonstrate variation across different ethnicities (86) .Different alleles code for two different versions of the COMT enzyme based on a Val-Met mutation.The Valcontaining allele produces a high-activity isoform (COMT-H), and the Met allele, a thermolabile, low-activity form (COMT-L).Palmatier et al. (86) demonstrated variation of the combination of the alleles on a global scale, with Caucasian populations possessing almost equal proportions of the two, leading to a moderate level of enzymatic activity.Asian populations, however, showed a higher proportion of the Val allele, and thus a higher level of COMT activity.This might explain the differences noted by Hursel et al. (84) , between ethnic groups, as the Val to Met substitution has been known to reduce COMT activity by up to a factor of 4. Thus, inhibiting a low-activity enzyme as in the Caucasian population would not result in a significant effect on fat metabolism, while inhibiting a high-activity enzyme in the Asian population would.
## (s21) Protein intake
(p21.0) Work by Hursel et al. (84) investigated any potential synergy between a Green tea -caffeine mixture with a high-protein diet on weight maintenance after a weight-loss period (87) .Such a context is particularly common in those who undertake weight training regimens with a view to increasing fat-free mass, and preventing significant fat mass regain, during a fat-loss programme.

(p21.1) However, contrary to this, the study found no significant additional synergistic effect between GTE -caffeine and a high protein intake on weight maintenance, determining the only real effect to be on those on an average protein diet.Hursel et al. reported only satiety increasing in high-protein diets, with the remaining effects observed being attributed as additive effects of the individual actions of the green tea and the protein intake, respectively.

(p21.2) The authors suggested that complex-forming between the protein within the diets and the polyphenols might account for the reduced activity and absorption, and indirectly therefore, the lack of observed synergy.The authors also raised the point that the ability of many milk-related proteins to bind to polyphenols this way may also be a contributory factor in any impeded polyphenolic activity.However, this last issue is somewhat debated, with a number of studies demonstrating no significant drop in bioavailability or absorption through milk ingestion (88,89) .
## (s22) Conclusion
(p22.0) Having considered the evidence supporting these putative effects of green tea, and despite the limitations present in these studies, it seems reasonable to suggest that in fact, green tea does seem to enable and aid the global reduction of fat, be it through increased EE or decreased absorption.

(p22.1) In light of the caveats outlined above, this author herein suggests a more compelling mechanism by which the actions of GTE may be mediated.Such an integrative approach does not appear to have been considered previously.

(p22.2) The final question is the potential of such a biological agent.Within a medical context, this is fairly obvious.The issue of obesity across the Western world has become one of the biggest public health issues of the twenty-first century.Current pharmacological interventions include pancreatic lipase inhibitors to reduce the absorption of fats, and while the long-term gains of these drugs appear modest, they mirror the effect of green tea on these enzymes.Given the relatively low cost of this beverage, it suggests a useful household-based approach to modulating obesity, with such target demographics being reflected in studies utilising obese test subjects (3,15,20,32) .

(p22.3) A more social application of these properties lies in a sporting environment, even at a professional level.Athletes requiring a drop in subcutaneous and visceral body fat could potentially employ green tea as a natural biological agent incorporated into an energy-controlled diet and fitness regimen.Such an application is supported by the findings of such studies where the greatest effects appeared to be gained by a combination of GTE and exercise together (13,32) .A more functional application might thus be a boost in muscle endurance during physical activity to prolong physical activity regimens before the onset of muscle fatigue and soreness (33,34,39,90) .This again implies a market in training supplements with a different biological focus.
