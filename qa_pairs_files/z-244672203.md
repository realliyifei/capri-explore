## (s2) Integrin signalling
(p2.0) The integrins comprise a superfamily of cell adhesion receptors that recognize ECM and cell-surface ligands [15]. There are 18 α-subunits and 8 β-subunits that assemble to create 24 functionally distinct transmembrane heterodimers. Integrins are grouped according to their ligand-binding specificity: collagen-binding integrins (α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1), laminin-binding integrins (α3β1, α6β1, α7β1, and α6β4), leukocyte-integrins (α4β1, α9β1, α4β7, αEβ7,αLβ2, αMβ2, αXβ2, and αDβ2) and arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-recognizing integrins (α5β1, α8β1, αVβ1, αVβ3, αVβ5, αVβ6, αVβ8, and αIIbβ3) [15] (Fig. 1a).

(p2.1) These receptor complexes have no enzymatic activity but instead activate bidirectional signaling pathways [13,15]. The affinity of integrin receptors for ECM components and other ligands is tightly regulated by inside-out signaling [15] (Fig. 1b). Integrin receptors maintain α and β subunit cytoplasmic tail association during their inactive stage, and cytoplasmic signals from associated G-protein coupled receptors lead integrin β subunit phosphorylation within its cytoplasmic domain for receptor activation [15,16]. The integrin binding of cytoskeletal proteins such as talin, vinculin and ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) acts to regulate actin microfilaments of the cytoskeleton [15,16]. In contrast, outside-in signaling occurs through the clustering of integrin receptors at the plasma membrane where ECM ligation transduces signals intracellularly [15,17] (Fig. 1b). Natural extracellular ligands include several components of the ECM such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin and vitronectin [13,15]. Extracellular ligand binding induces conformational changes in the integrin receptor to allow intracellular tails of the β subunit to engage with intracellular signaling molecules including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), small GTPases Rho and Ras, and adaptors, such 1 3 as Cas/Crk and paxillin [17]. These activated integrin-ECM interactions lead to the formation of dynamic adhesion structures as small extensions from the plasma membrane called podosomes [15,16,18]. After ECM ligation, integrins acting alone or in complex with growth factors present in the local microenvironment can regulate diverse tumor cell functions, such as migration, invasion, adhesion and proliferation through the activation of various signaling pathways [13,15].
## (s6) Integrin-mediated mesothelial attachment and migration
(p6.0) When establishing secondary tumors, spheroids attach to the mesothelium lining through the interactions between spheroids and surface receptors on the mesothelial layer [22,65]. At this point, spheroid cells induce expression of several integrins that prime the spheroids for attachment to the mesothelium and underlying ECM proteins [22,41,66]. For example, interaction between spheroid cells expressing α5β1-integrin receptor and the mesothelium containing fibronectin matrix is essential for spheroid adhesion [41].
## (s7) Integrins as therapeutic targets for EOC
(p7.0) Novel therapies that focus on malignant cells and their interactions with the tumor microenvironment in EOC have gained substantial interest due to the complexity of this disease. As described in detail above, integrins are key regulators at various steps in the unique metastatic cascade of EOC, particularly during the process of spheroid formation during transit, and for peritoneal invasion where integrin-ECM interactions are essential during spheroid adhesion and invasion [36].
