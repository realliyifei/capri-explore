## (s1) CME: ETIOPATHOGENESIS
(p1.0) CME is a disorder that involves the central retina, caused by an accumulation of extracellular fluid in the macular region with secondary formation of multiple cystic spaces (7).Histological studies show that radially orientated cystoid spaces consisting of ophthalmoscopically clear fluid are often clinically detectable in the macula area.These cysts seem to be areas of the retina in which the cells have been displaced (1).It is the result of cystic accumulation of extracellular intraretinal fluid in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers of the retina (8).
## (s3) . Niacin favorably affects apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins (very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], lowdensity lipoprotein [LDL], lipoprotein[a]) and increases apo A-I-containing lipoproteins (high-density lipoprotein [HDL]
(p3.0) ).There are new data on how niacin affects triglycerides (TG), vascular anti-inflammatory events, a particular niacin receptor in adipocytes and immune cells, and the characterization of a niacin transport system in liver and intestinal cells that is dependent on acidic pH, temperature, energy, Ca2+-calmodulinmediated pathways, but transport is sodium independent (36)(37)(38)(39)(40)(41)(42).Niacin directly and noncompetitively inhibits hepatocyte diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, a key enzyme in TG synthesis that results in accelerated intracellular hepatic apo B degradation.Niacin reduces apolipoprotein C-III levels by inhibition of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1b (PGC-1b), allowing greater apoEdriven clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (43).
## (s4) SYSTEMIC SIDE EFFECTS OF NIACIN
(p4.0) The problem with niacin is the high incidence of flushing (57).The flushing is cutaneous and usually restricted to the face and chest and is also associated with a burning sensation and often generalized pruritus.It lasts 20-30 min and habituates with exposure declining in both severity and frequency with time (58-59).
## (s5) NIACIN AND OCULAR EFFECTS
(p5.0) Many authors reported ocular side effect after therapy with niacin.Fraunfelder et al. (5) reported that 3 g or more per day of nicotinic acid, could cause blurred vision, eyelid edema, toxic amblyopia, proptosis, loss of eyelashes or eyebrow, superficial punctate keratitis and CME.Some cases of blurred vision were reported in the literature (73), and 18 cases were reported to the National Registry or the FDA spontaneous reporting system.In these cases, the average dose of niacin was 1.5-2 g per day, with a duration of therapy varying from 6 weeks to 1 year.Follow-up reported complete resolution of visual symptoms after discontinuing niacin.Dry eye was explained because this vitamin may be secreted and concentrated in human tears, thereby irritating an already dry eye.Niacin can cause ocular signs and symptoms reversible dose related, so if the patient wishes to continue this therapy, it may be feasible to reduce the dose of the drug (6).Cases of niacin related maculopathy there is a 10:1 male: female ratio.Most cases were in their third to fifth decade of life and were being treated with an average dose of 3-6 g of niacin per day.The etiology of niacin's effect on the macula is unknown, A first hypothesis suggests that, in patients with vascular or inflammatory diseases, niacin induces the release of prostaglandins, causing the bloodretinal barrier compromise with extracellular accumulation of fluid in many cystic spaces.This theory is not entirely accepted for the absence of fluorescein leakage (74).
