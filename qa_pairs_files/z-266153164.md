## (s2) Research design: The necessity of transforming the garment industry into a CE
(p2.0) Literature study with reference to the systematic approach proposed by Levy and Ellis [23], which consists of three components: inputs, processing and outputs [4] (Figure 1).Part 1 of the study investigated the necessity of transforming the garment industry into a CE.The input section clarified the research direction and leading questions, which aided the study scope narrowing, filtered helpful information, and aided the rapid generation of findings.The leading questions (Q) are as follows:

(p2.1) Q1: What is currently the most significant issue in garment industry development?Processing requires keywords based on the leading questions, which were as follows: "garment industry," "CE," and "sustainability."A combined keyword identification search of WoS (n1) and Scopus (n2) retrieved 124 documents and 126 documents, respectively, which were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.The filtering criteria were document type (only papers and review papers), language (only English texts), and year (published in the last 5 years [2019-2023]).After the screening, the two platforms yielded 114 papers (n3) and 82 (n4) papers, respectively.

(p2.2) In the secondary screening, articles that appeared on both platforms (duplicates) were removed.By using the WoS search list as a reference, 52 duplicate articles were screened out of the Scopus search list using the function algorithm to check duplicate data in Excel, which yielded n5: 144 non-duplicate articles for both platforms.A final screening of n5 was conducted, where the screening criterion was abstract relevance, which yielded n6: 56 articles.In the output stage, the contents of the articles were analysed and the leading questions were answered.Finally, the results were discussed and summarised, and conclusions were obtained in the output stage.
