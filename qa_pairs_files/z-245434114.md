## (s4) Cellular biology of net
(p4.0) As such pNETs were classically thought to arise from pancreatic islet cells or the islets of Langerhans, hence the term islet cell tumors was coined [22]. Islet cells are the endocrine cells of the pancreas and they constitute 1-2% of total pancreatic mass. They are therefore distinct from the exocrine cells, from which pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas arise. They are composed of various cell types and responsible for secretion of hormones like beta cells (insulin), alpha cells (glucagon), delta cells (somatostatin), and PP cells (pancreatic polypeptide) [23]. However, current theory says that pNETs in fact arise from the APUD (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation) cells [24]. The presence of neurosecretory granules is the characteristic feature of APUD cells and these neurosecretory granules have autocrine, paracrine and neuromodulatory functions, in addition to the endocrine property. These cells are thought to originate in the embryologic neural crest, but more recent research suggests that they originate in the embryologic endoderm [25].
## (s5) Olecular pathology of PNET and its role in prognosis
(p5.0) Most recent advancements in assessment of pancreatic NET is the development of microRNA profiling which corresponds to various proliferation indices and also propensity of tumor to cause local spread and distant metastasis [30]. MicroRNA are non-coding RNA sequences having length of 21-25 nucleotides. They regulate genes at post translational level [31]. They can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes and play a significant role in proliferation of tumors or their dissemination [32]. They can act as diagnostic as well as a prognostic marker.

(p5.1) There is very limited data available regarding microRNA profiling of pNET. In one large study done on pancreatic NET, 28   be differentially expressed with 18 of them being higher expressed and 10 lower expressed as compared to healthy pancreatic tissue [33]. There is a higher expression of miR-103, miR-107 and miR-193b and lower expression of let-7 miR and miR-155 in pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasias [34]. Tumor proliferation is denoted by expression levels of miR-196a, miR-21 and miR-642 while miR-210 and miR-21 seem to correlate with metastatic disease and tumor recurrence is predicted by expression of both miR-196a and miR-27b [35,36].
## (s6) Clinical presentation
(p6.0) Since non functional pNET represent up to 90% of PanNETs, they present with high hormone levels without symptoms. However, upto 60% of these patients have a metastatic disease at diagnosis, while 21% present with a locally advanced disease [41].

(p6.1) Non specific symptoms of pNET include abdominal pain, weight loss, or mass effect related to the pancreatic tumor or to the distant spread. Less frequently it is associated with complaints of jaundice, hemorrhage from tumors, and a palpable mass. Symptoms often do not appear until metastases develop [42].

(p6.2) Usually endocrine tumors of the pancreas present with typical symptoms due to hormonal hypersecretion, such as insulinoma, gastrinoma, VIP-oma, glucagonoma and somatostatinoma. In upto 40%-50, cases may present as non-functioning tumors or secrete pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and neurotensin [43]. The various pancreatic NET subtypes with their incidence, clinical presentation and survival are mentioned below (   Table 6) [52]. When any NET is suspected then fasting gut hormones such as chromogranin B, pancreatic polypeptide and urinary 5HIAA (a breakdown product of serotonin) are also useful baseline tests. False positive chromogranin A levels are caused due to treatment with a proton pump inhibitor, Parkinson's disease, hypertension, glucocorticoids, renal failure and atrophic gastritis, while various dietary factors and drugs can cause an elevated urinary 5HIAA [53].

(p6.3) Additional blood tests for secreted peptides can be useful if a clinical syndrome is suspected and calcium, prolactin and parathyroid hormones should be tested in possible MEN1 cases. For Nonfunctioning pNETs, pancreatic polypeptide is a useful test. For insulinomas the gold standard diagnostic tool is supervised fasting with serial blood glucose analysis. Diagnosis requires the fulfillment of Whipple's triad of hypoglycemia, symptoms and correction of symptoms with glucose, in the presence of non-suppressed insulin levels. Factitious hypoglycemia due to administration of insulin or sulfonylureas must be ruled out [54].
## (s7) Radiological
(p7.0) Cross sectional imaging plays an important role in the workup of PNETs by characterizing the primary tumor and determining the extent of disease. Location of the tumor and its spread can be delineated by the use of multimodality imaging which includes computed tomography (CT), MRI and various nuclear medicine scans. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), digital subtraction angiography and venous sampling can also be used [55]. The sensitivity of CT and MRI is more than 80% for the detection of PNETs which is more sensitive than an octreotide-based scintigraphic scans [56].

(p7.1) EUS acts as an indispensable accompaniment to CT or MRI and has superior resolution. For tumors with size as small as 2 mm, EUS shows sensitivity of more than 90% and when combined with cross sectional imaging the sensitivity reaches upto 100%. Addition of EUS is recommended when cross-sectional imaging fails to define the pancreatic mass, when the location of primary cannot be delineated or biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis before commencing the treatment [57].  Table 6.
## (s10) Management
(p10.0) Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) have an important role in deciding the treatment of these tumors as they are slightly rare. Treatment options range from curative surgery to palliation with medical therapies including somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy and targeted treatments [67].

(p10.1) Conservative management is indicated for incidentalomas, i.e. the tumors which are small, non functional and asymptomatic [68]. Although it is a controversy whether small nonfunctional tumors of under 2 cm should be resected, when they are likely to have less metastatic potential, but a more aggressive surgical approach is recommended for tumors over 2 cm [69].
## (s12) Systemic therapy
(p12.0) In patients with resectable PanNETs, surgery with curative intent (that is, R0 or margins that are microscopically free of tumor) remains the treatment of choice. Unfortunately, as the majority of patients with PanNETs either present with metastatic disease or have disease recurrence within 2 years of surgery, effective systemic therapies are also needed [82].
## (s15) Cytotoxic chemotherapies
(p15.0) Much of the focus on treatment over the past half century has been on the use of conventional cytotoxic agents such as streptozocin [99] and temozolomide [100]. Sunitinib and everolimus are approved for use in PNETs (Table 11).
## (s16) Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)
(p16.0) Majority of neuroendocrine tumors show increased level expression of somatostatin receptors (SSRs) 2 and 5 on the tumor cell surface and it forms the basis  of not only functional imaging but also tumor directed therapies like somatostatin analogues [111]. Beyond somatostatin analogues, PRRT, which is described as peptide receptor radioligand therapy or targeted radiotherapy using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs is emerging as an effective treatment modality in metastatic, well-differentiated, grade 1 and 2 GEP-NET [112]. Yttrium, a high-energy β particle emitter and Lutetium, a β and γ particle emitter with lower tissue penetration are most commonly studied radioligands [113] (Table 12).
