## (s1) Background
(p1.0) In health, pancreatic islet β-cells respond to metabolic and neurohormonal signals to secrete insulin into the portal vein at finely controlled variable rates to ensure that blood glucose level and overall metabolic homeostasis are maintained. Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose concentrations as a consequence of an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion or inadequate insulin secretion to compensate for ineffective insulin action. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the autoimmune destruction of the islet β-cells and results in absolute insulin deficiency [1]. An inability to match insulin delivery with an individual's changing insulin requirements results in either hypoglycemia (low blood glucose level) or hyperglycemia (high blood glucose level). Hypoglycemia, if severe, may result in loss of consciousness, seizures, or even death. Long-term exposure to hyperglycemia results in complications such as blindness, limb amputations, and cardiovascular disease. Maintaining blood glucose levels in a healthy range is essential for the avoidance of severe shortand long-term complications of diabetes [1].
## (s2) Objectives
(p2.0) The main objective of this survey is to identify and review the MAPS that have been proposed to date in terms of used inputs, control architectures, and validation methods. To develop better systems, it is critical to understand the current state of MAPS and identify associated complexities. We aim to achieve this through conducting an in-depth analysis of previous related studies. The current pace of APS development has been slow, prompting movements such as #WeAreNotWaiting by people with T1D, which focuses on do-it-yourself APS [32]. This synthesis may accelerate work on developing improved MAPS. This survey identified a variety of additional signals that have been integrated into experimental APS. Most of the reviewed publications focused upon noninvasive inputs from wearable devices. These additional input signals have been integrated into different architectures to augment the controllers, in particular (1) for activity detection and switching of controller modes, (2) as direct inputs to the controller for decision-making, and (3) for the development of intermediate modules of the controller (eg, hypoglycemia prediction or meal detection). A variety of physiological models, simulation environments, and clinical studies have been used for validation of the results. A detailed analysis is presented in later sections.
## (s13) Noninvasive Inputs
(p13.0) The types of additional inputs integrated or proposed to be integrated into APS that were identified can be categorized as (1) noninvasive inputs captured through wearable devices (most of them) and (2)  Managing meal effects is vital in APS development and at present it is challenging because of the heavy user burden, inaccuracies in carbohydrate counting, and forgetting to bolus. Turksoy et al [56,57] developed meal detection and carbohydrate estimation algorithms based on CGM measurements. However, in this survey, our focus was specifically on the use of MAPS design. Additional signals explored in the analyzed studies were not specifically used to improve glucose regulation related to meals.
## (s15) MAPS Architectures
(p15.0) The additional inputs identified in the previous section have been integrated into different architectures to augment the controllers (   [47] MATLAB simulation Fuzzy fusion controller to fuse the additional input to prompt glucagon infusion (dual hormone) PID c controller ECG a , HR b , and skin resistance Khan et al [48] MATLAB simulation Fuzzy fusion controller to fuse the additional input to prompt glucagon infusion (dual hormone)

HR and accelerometer input were used in this approach, where the controller mode was changed through adjusting parameters and thresholds within the controller. Stenerson et al [50] suspended their predictive low-glucose suspend algorithm, and DeBoer et al [51] adjusted the hypoglycemia risk threshold in their control-to-range controller when exercise was detected. Jacobs et al [42] used a fading memory proportional derivative dual hormone controller that, upon the detection of exercise, carried out dosing of insulin and glucagon based on a set of static rules. This approach only focused on activity detection. However, the identified additional inputs may contain valuable information related to the glucose regulation process. Hence, studies have focused on direct integration of the additional inputs for decision-making.

(p15.2) Quiroz and Femat [46], Quiroz et al [47], Resalat et al [43], Turksoy et al [36,37], and Hajizadeh et al [38] focused on direct integration of additional inputs in the controller design. Quiroz and Femat [46] and Quiroz et al [47] directly integrated lactate and adrenaline input into their H ∞ control algorithm. Resalat et al [43] developed a run-to-run MPC that used continuous MET data for exercise detection. Turksoy et al [36]  GSR into a generalized predictive controller by developing time series models using autoregressive moving average with external input, recursive least squares, and constrained optimization techniques. They improved on their work by introducing a time-varying forgetting factor for the weighted recursive least squares algorithm and focusing on trajectory tracking [37]. Hajizadeh et al [38] used recursive subspace identification techniques to develop an adaptive MPC controller incorporating MET input. The continuously integrated inputs such as EE and GSR provided valuable and timely insights regarding the glucose regulatory process, which is valuable.

(p15.3) Designing submodules for the APS has also been widely explored, where the focus has been on using the input to enhance insulin and glucagon infusion and to design safety mechanisms for the APS. These submodules were mainly linked to identified limitations such as meal detection, activity detection, and hypoglycemia detection. Khan et al [48] and Qaisar et al [49] developed a hypoglycemia-detection module using HR, ECG (QT Interval), and skin resistance. In addition to the main controller focusing on insulin infusion, a fuzzy logic fusion controller was introduced to infuse glucagon based on the identified signals during a hypoglycemia event. Turksoy et al [41] performed a clinical trial where hypoglycemia early alarm [55], meal detection [56,64], hypoglycemia prediction, and carbohydrate recommendation [57] modules were integrated into the final APS design. Hajizadeh at al [38] focused on plasma insulin concentration estimation and meal effect estimation modules in their research. Resalat et al [43] proposed and evaluated an insulin sensitivity adaptation algorithm and an adaptive-learning postprandial hypoglycemia prevention algorithm. However, it is important to note that some of these submodules only used existing CGM measurements. Different safety modules have also been introduced, where Turksoy et al [36] and DeBoer et al [51] focused on hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia safety, respectively, through insulin-on-board estimates. The development of submodules enhances the interpretability of the APS operation, which is essential in safety-critical applications. Most of the studies have used submodules in their controllers, both with switching the controller mode through activity detection and when additional inputs are directly integrated. Hence, designing submodules using additional input targeting the identified limitations is beneficial in APS development.
## (s20) Conclusions and Comparison With Prior Work
(p20.0) Kudva et al [30] analyzed the clinical importance of incorporating additional signals, and Cinar [29] and Patek [31] analyzed the current limitations in APS design and the approach to MAPS development. In this survey, we analyzed existing APS designs to identify the types of input variables used, control techniques, architectures, and validation methodologies. This survey was restricted to studies that proposed APS. However, research studies exist that aim to identify relationships between various physiological signals and T1D. The identification of such relationships would be beneficial for the development of MAPS. Previous research has also focused on designing submodules such as meal detection [56], carbohydrate recommendation [57], and hypoglycemia prediction [55] modules for APS. Given the scope of this survey, such submodules were only identified and only the final integrated APS were evaluated. This survey mainly focused on the technical aspects of MAPS development. It is also important to explore and evaluate the corresponding practical aspects (eg, additional user burden, sensor failures, and psychosocial impact).

(p20.1) The integration of additional signals is an approach to mitigate the current limitations of the APS. Most of the integrated additional inputs in previous research are from wearables. The widespread availability of wearables could be seen as a factor facilitating MAPS. Past studies have mainly focused on using the additional inputs for detecting exercise (HR, accelerometer, and EE), hypoglycemia (ECG, HR, EE, and GSR), and stress (GSR). In future, these additional sensors might also be valuable in capturing other physiological changes such as illnesses, alcohol consumption, and seasonal variations. Previous randomized crossover studies were able to obtain lower time in hypoglycemia and improvements in the normal glycemic range when additional inputs were integrated. However, these systems need to be improved to obtain better time in target range for glucose to improve the quality of life of people with T1D. The lack of an FDA-approved simulator for testing the identified additional input can be identified as a major constraint regarding the development of MAPS. It is important to explore different additional inputs further to establish relationships with glucose regulation and use them to address the identified limitations. The practical complexities and psychosocial aspects associated with MAPS need to be evaluated to develop effective APS.
