## (s1) Data Collection and Methodology
(p1.0) The Web of science (WOS) is the most widespread database on different scientific fields which is frequently used for searching the statistical data regarding scientific literature [46].WOS includes over 1.2 × 10 4 journals worldwide, 1.5 × 10 5 conference proceedings and 2.75 × 10 5 books and book chapters.WOS citation databases are Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded from 1998 to present), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI from 1993 to present), Arts and Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI from 1993 to present), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Sciences and Humanities (CPCI-SSH), and the two chemistry databases named Index Chemicus (IC) and Current Chemical Reactions (CCR-Expanded).For these reasons in this paper the WOS database was used to collect the articles related to the field of "Chemistry".The search was confined to the scholarly communications from 1993 to 2012 indexed by Thomson Reuthers' WOS, and was performed from 1 to 10 January 2014.
## (s12) The Top Cited Korean Chemistry-Related Scholarly Communications from 1993 to 2012
(p12.0) The 20 most cited chemistry-related scholarly communications published by Korean scientists from 1993 to 2012 have attracted more than 12,539 citations in total with about 627 citations per communication on average (see Table 6).Table 6.The most frequently cited scholarly communications in the field of chemistry published by authors affiliated to Korean institutions or universities from 1993 to 2012.The "Times Cited" in the last column indicates the number of the times where a published communication was cited by other authors (including conference proceedings).introduced the "conceptual approach that requires the use of secondary building units to direct the assembly of ordered frameworks epitomizes this process" called reticular synthesis) [53].
## (s14) Conclusions
(p14.0) The present systematic review employs a scientometric analysis of the Web of Science (WOS) database to explore the trends in the Korean chemistry-related scholarly communications from 1993 to 2012.Within the limits of this type of study [33,44,46], the following results have been obtained from this analysis: (1) A total number of 5660 communications related to chemistry were published by at least one author affiliated to Korean institutions or universities during the observed period of time;

(p14.1) (2) The Koreans' interest in the field of chemistry-and more specifically in the field of Chemical Engineering Physical Chemistry and Materials Science-has strongly increased recently as shows the exponentially increasing quantity of chemistry-related scholarly communications; (3) The 20 most cited chemistry-related scholarly communications published by Korean scientists (1993-2012) have attracted more than 12,539 citations in total (627 citations per communication).

(p14.2) Statistical findings suggest that English (5629 communications, 99.5%) and Article (5361 communications, 98.9%) were the most commonly used Language and Document Type, respectively, by authors affiliated to Korean institutions or universities.Chemistry Multidisciplinary (34.9%),Chemical Engineering (14.8%), Physical Chemistry (12.6%), Materials Science Multidisciplinary (12.1%) and Chemistry Organic (9.2%) were the top five most common WOS categories in which a total of 4734 communications (83.6%) were listed.
