## (s6) Feeding Difficulties in Late Preterm Infants
(p6.0) A total of 15 studies, eight conducted in North America, six in Europe, and one in Asia, addressed the occurrence of feeding difficulties in late preterm infants. Among them, nine were prospective observational studies, two retrospectives, two cross-sectional, one qualitative, and one mixed method. The results from the included studies indicate that breastfeeding rates in late preterm infants are lower than those of term infants due to the occurrence of feeding difficulties mostly related to their immature physiologic functions and/or oromotor dysfunctions, particularly at the lowest gestational ages. An improvement in breastfeeding rates through the first weeks after hospital discharge has been reported, reflecting the time late preterm infants need to achieve competency in feeding.

(p6.1) Gianni et al. [13] performed a cross-sectional questionnaire survey including 92 mothers of late preterm infants admitted to level I and II of care. The authors reported that at discharge, 94% of infants were fed any human milk. However, only 43% of them were exclusively human milk fed. Dosani et al. [14] conducted an exploratory mixed method study, enrolling a convenient sample of 122 mothers of late preterm infants. The authors found that the exclusive breastfeeding rate at 6-8 weeks postpartum was 14%. Moreover, they interviewed 11 mothers and ten nurses who reported that breastfeeding late preterm infants is challenging mainly due to the lack of effective coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Kair et al. [15] conducted a qualitative study to assess the breastfeeding experience of late preterm mothers. Breastfeeding represented a positive bonding experience. However, mothers reported milk supply concerns, negative experiences with breast pumping, and feelings of failure. In line with the previous findings, Crippa et al. [16] conducted an observational study on 189 late preterm infants admitted to level I of care. The authors reported an exclusive breastfeeding rate at discharge of 16.8%, which increased to 40.3% at 15 days, reflecting that late preterm infants needed more time to become competent in breastfeeding skills. Nagulesapillai et al. [17], in their communitybased prospective pregnancy cohort, including 137 late preterm mothers interviewed at four months after delivery, demonstrated that being born late preterm was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of breastfeeding difficulties related to the baby (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.24-2.38). Accordingly, DeMauro et al. [18] interviewed parents of 571 late preterm infants. They reported that at three months, 27% showed symptoms such as choking and spitting compatible with oromotor dysfunction (17%) and avoidant feeding behavior (29%), decreasing to 4% and 12% at one year, respectively.

(p6.2) Lee et al. [19], in their observational study including 106 late preterm infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit, reported a similar trend of breastfeeding rates, which increased from 5.7% at the end of the first week to 19.8% at the 12th week. Moreover, the authors found that 43.4% of the mothers reported feeding difficulties.

(p6.3) McDonald et al. [20] performed a prospective community-based cohort study including 77 mothers of late preterm infants. The authors reported that late preterm mothers experienced more frequent breastfeeding difficulties and earlier discontinuation of breastfeeding at four months than full-term mothers (69.3 vs. 81.7%, respectively).

## (s7) Effect of Feeding Difficulties on Maternal Mental Health
(p7.0) A total of four prospective observational studies, three conducted in Europe and one in North America, addressed the effect of feeding difficulties on maternal mental health. Based on the results of the included studies, mothers of late preterm infants experience a higher level of anxiety, depression, and stress than mothers of full-term infants, which in turn negatively affects breastfeeding success.

(p7.1) In their prospective community-based cohort, McDonald et al. [20] included 77 mothers of late preterm infants and reported that late preterm mothers were at higher risk of having anxiety symptoms four months after delivery than full-term mothers (OR 2.07, CI 1.08; 3.98). Zanardo et al. [27] performed a prospective case-control study in 42 late preterm mothers matched with 42 mothers of full-term newborns to assess their psychological distress in the postpartum period. The late preterm mothers showed a significantly higher state of anxiety, depression, and stress than full-term mothers, as indicated by the scores gained according to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the Psychological Stress Measure (PSM) (trait anxiety 45.8 ± 10.1 vs. 39 ± 6.1, p < 0.02; state anxiety, 49.5 ± 9 vs. 42.6 ± 5.3, p < 0.002; EPDS, 9.5 ± 4.5 vs. 6.3 ± 3.9, p < 0.0008; PSM, 46.5 + 5.9 vs. 38.9, p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the psychological distress experienced by late preterm mothers was the most significant independent risk factor for early cessation of breastfeeding. In a following case-control study, the authors [28] compared the maternal personality profile and attitudes towards lactation between 30 late preterm mothers and 60 full-term mothers. They reported that late preterm mothers experienced deep stress according to the Luscher Color Test general interpretation.

## (s8) Effect of Feeding Difficulties on Maternal-Infant Relationship
(p8.0) A total of three prospective observational studies conducted in Europe addressed the effect of feeding difficulties on the maternal-infant relationship. The results of the included studies highlighted that mothers of late preterm mothers show an altered bonding which is associated with the reduction of breastfeeding rates in the months following hospital discharge. A direct correlation was also reported between maternal self-efficacy and the degree of adaptation to infants' breastfeeding behavior and success.

(p8.1) Zanardo et al. [28] aimed to compare the mother-to-infant bonding attitude among 30 mothers of late preterm infants and 60 mothers of full-term infants by administering the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale. The authors found that mothers of late preterm infants had significantly lower bonding as indicated by the scoring of dislike and disappointment. Moreover, a significant negative association was found between the bonding alteration of late preterm mothers and reduced breastfeeding rates from discharge to the following six postnatal months. In line with these findings, Gerhardsson et al. [29] highlighted the virtuous circle between maternal self-efficacy and successful breastfeeding. The authors assessed maternal self-efficacy in a cohort of 105 late preterm mothers by administering the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form and reported a direct association between the degree of self-efficacy and the degree of adaptation to their infant's breastfeeding behavior. The authors further assessed the association of the degree of maternal self-efficacy on breastfeeding duration, highlighting that, among the enrolled late preterm mothers, those exclusively breastfeeding at 40 weeks and three months of corrected age had higher scores according to the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale than those who did not [30].

## (s9) Discussion
(p9.0) The most prevalent feeding issues were challenging breastfeeding establishment and maintenance, delayed oral feeding, poor coordination in sucking-swallowing-breathing reflexes, low oromotor tone, and sleepy behavior. As a result, late preterm infants have an earlier onset of exhaustion during meals and an earlier cessation of breastfeeding. In this complex scenario, it must be considered that the feeding difficulties experienced by late preterm infants may be exacerbated by the need for admission to neonatal intensive care, which causes early separation from their mothers. In addition, gestational age is inversely correlated with the chance of experiencing eating issues. Remarkably, feeding difficulties appear to negatively impact the mother's mental health and the mother-infant relationship, resulting in anxiety, stress, and depression.

(p9.1) These data strongly underline the need for more attention and support by healthcare professionals who play a leading role in the promotion and support of breastfeeding and the education and support of mothers, responding to their concerns and fears and helping them understand the physiological prematurity of their infants [31][32][33]. Indeed, an awareness of the diversity of breastfeeding experience may contribute to providing tailored professional care and supportive relationships [34,35]. Lau et al. [36] highlighted the need to consider the specific interplay of the several factors that may impact breastfeeding within the individual maternal-infant dyads when planning interventions to promote and support positive breastfeeding experiences. Breastfeeding late preterm infants is particularly challenging due to the influence of several factors related to the prematurity status (i.e., sleeping behavior, low oromotor tone). For this reason, healthcare breastfeeding support that considers the strict interrelationship between prematurity and feeding behaviors has been strongly advocated [37].

(p9.2) Ravn et al. [38] reported that an early intervention to promote the establishment of good interaction between infants and mothers contributes to the reduction of postpartum depression and successful breastfeeding. Accordingly, Park et al. [39] demonstrated that mothers of very preterm infants, when showing psychological distress, are less prone to have developmentally supportive feeding behaviors. These results indicate that targeted intervention to support maternal psychological well-being may be useful in promoting early feeding interactions within the dyad. Remarkably, Rosenblad et al. [40] reported that mothers of preterm infants who gained high scores on the Breastfeeding Self-efficacy Scale-Short Form at term perceived their infants as having better state regulation at three months. This finding is noteworthy not only because maternal self-efficacy can be strengthened by targeted intervention resulting in a better breastfeeding outcome, but also because greater maternal self-efficacy facilitates better interaction and mutual adaptation within the dyad.
