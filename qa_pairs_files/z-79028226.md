## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is increasingly common. This increase seems to be the result of the pandemic situation with regard to sexually transmitted diseases (STD) that has prevailed in recent years in several developing countries. Sterility as a sequelae to PID [1] has reached such proportions that it has even begun to influence the population structure.

(p0.1) The etiology of PID is multifactorial. Approximately 15 percent of PID cases in western industrial countries are associated with iatrogenic measures, such as insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) [2]. Most of the remaining cases seem to be "venereal" in origin, that is, occurring as an STD [3]. Also among "iatrogenic" PID cases, however, such agents can be the cause of PID, as they often occur in asymptomatic carriers, including women consulting for birth control.
## (s1) Serological Studies
(p1.0) Several methods have been devised to detect antibodies to M. hominis. They include complement fixation [9,14], metabolic inhibition [28], growth inhibition [29], and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests [30,31]. IHA tests-performed as described by Krogsgaard-Jensen [30]-have been found to be superior to the other tests mentioned for detection of antibodies to M. hominis in women. A similar experience has been reported in grivet monkeys, experimentally infected with M. hominis, which developed PID [32].

(p1.1) Antibodies to M. hominis as demonstrated by CF tests occurred in nine (33 percent) of 27 women with PID [21], and in 20 (39 percent) of 51 women with PID [9]. IHA antibodies to the organism occurred in 28 (54 percent) of 52 women in whom the diagnosis of PID was verified by laparoscopy, as compared to 11 percent in 56 women in whom laparoscopy showed no infectious conditions, e.g., cysts and endometriosis [12]. Eschenbach et al. [27] found that 17 (22 percent) of 84 PID patients had antibodies to M. hominis. Of 60 consecutive cases with acute salpingitis, IHA antibodies to M. hominis occurred in 24, ten of whom developed a significant titer change [13]. Antibodies to C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae occurred in 80 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of these 60 PID patients. A significant antibody response to these two latter organisms occurred in 20 and three women, respectively [13]. In a series of 166 Danish women with PID, 23 percent showed a significant antibody response to M. hominis. Interestingly, 14.6 percent of the 75 M. hominis culture-negative cases also developed such an antibody response [15] (Table 2).

(p1.2) Increased serum levels of IgM (> 155 mg per 100 ml) was demonstrated in 18 of 53 women with salpingitis and serological evidence of a significant antibody  [33]. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation between the IgM increase and the presence of serum IHA antibodies to M. hominis.

(p1.3) The IgM level of 200-299 itg per 100 ml was found in 11 percent and of > 300 in seven of 53 PID cases. The maximum level was 380 mg per 100 ml. In a few cases there was also a slight increase in the serum IgG and IgA [33].

(p1.4) As in M. pneumoniae infections [34] the increased IgM levels found in PID patients presumably could not be explained by the formation of antibodies specifically directed against M. hominis. Most probably they denote an unspecific stimulation of the immune system [331. So far, there is, however, no evidence that M. hominis acts as a polyclonal B-cell stimulator. Antibodies to M. pneumoniae did not occur more commonly in the PID patients than in the general population of the study area [33]. A corresponding rise in the IgM antibody level was found in grivet monkeys experimentally infected with M. hominis, which developed parametritis rather than endosalpingitis [32]. Lack of IgM to IgG Conversion Some patients with M. hominis-associated salpingitis did not show conversion from essentially an IgM to an IgG antibody response to M. hominis. Persistence of mainly IgM antibody formation was found for several months [33]. This is in conformity with findings in patients with M. pneumoniae [34].

(p1.5) Several methods have been devised to detect antibodies to M. hominis. They include complement fixation [9,14], metabolic inhibition [28], growth inhibition [29], and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests [30,31]. IHA tests-performed as described by Krogsgaard-Jensen [30]-have been found to be superior to the other tests mentioned for detection of antibodies to M. hominis in women. A similar experience has been reported in grivet monkeys, experimentally infected with M. hominis, which developed PID [32].

## (s3) EXPERIMENTAL INFECTION WITH MYCOPLASMA HOMINIS IN MONKEYS
(p3.0) In grivet monekys, parametritis and salpingitis developed within three days when M. hominis was inoculated directly into the fallopian tubes. Thus there was swelling and hyperemia of the tubes and the parametria became edematous. The tubal subserosa was heavily infiltrated with lymphoid cells and an increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In the parametria many lymphocytes and some granulocytes were found, as well as fat necrosis and granulation tissue. After four to five weeks the upper genital tract of the monkeys was virtually normal again [36].
## (s4) ASCENDANT INFECTIONS WITH UREAPLASMA UREAL YTICUM IN NATURALLY ACQUIRED INFECTIONS IN WOMEN AND IN EXPERIMENTAL INFECTIONS IN MONKEYS
(p4.0) U. urealyticum has been recovered from the fallopian tubes [27], from cul-de-sac of a woman with a tubovarian abscess [38], and in a woman with signs of acute salpingitis [11]. A significant antibody response, i.e., of metabolic-inhibition antibodies, to U. urealyticum (to a strain isolated from the fallopian tube of a PID patient) has been demonstrated in one woman with acute salpingitis [24]. Eschenbach et al. [27] found 15 of 204 PID patients to develop ureaplasmacidal antibodies. Sweet et al. [26] found U. urealyticum in cul-de-sac fluid in four of 26 women with PID (also in the fallopian tubes of one of them).
## (s5) SEQUELAE OF MYCOPLASMAL PID
(p5.0) No studies have so far been presented concerning sequelae of PID stratified with regard to the major common etiological agents of PID, including M. hominis. The risk of sterility after PID is known to be high-roughly 10-15 percent after one episode of the disease, 35 percent after two, and 75 percent after three or more such episodes [1]. Chronic abdominal pain and increased risk for etopic pregnancy [49] are other common sequelae after PID. Whether such sequelae also occur after M. hominis-associated PID is not known.

(p19.2) Increased serum levels of IgM (> 155 mg per 100 ml) was demonstrated in 18 of 53 women with salpingitis and serological evidence of a significant antibody  [33]. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation between the IgM increase and the presence of serum IHA antibodies to M. hominis.

(p19.3) The IgM level of 200-299 itg per 100 ml was found in 11 percent and of > 300 in seven of 53 PID cases. The maximum level was 380 mg per 100 ml. In a few cases there was also a slight increase in the serum IgG and IgA [33].

(p19.4) As in M. pneumoniae infections [34] the increased IgM levels found in PID patients presumably could not be explained by the formation of antibodies specifically directed against M. hominis. Most probably they denote an unspecific stimulation of the immune system [331. So far, there is, however, no evidence that M. hominis acts as a polyclonal B-cell stimulator. Antibodies to M. pneumoniae did not occur more commonly in the PID patients than in the general population of the study area [33]. A corresponding rise in the IgM antibody level was found in grivet monkeys experimentally infected with M. hominis, which developed parametritis rather than endosalpingitis [32]. Lack of IgM to IgG Conversion Some patients with M. hominis-associated salpingitis did not show conversion from essentially an IgM to an IgG antibody response to M. hominis. Persistence of mainly IgM antibody formation was found for several months [33]. This is in conformity with findings in patients with M. pneumoniae [34].

(p19.5) Several methods have been devised to detect antibodies to M. hominis. They include complement fixation [9,14], metabolic inhibition [28], growth inhibition [29], and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests [30,31]. IHA tests-performed as described by Krogsgaard-Jensen [30]-have been found to be superior to the other tests mentioned for detection of antibodies to M. hominis in women. A similar experience has been reported in grivet monkeys, experimentally infected with M. hominis, which developed PID [32].

(p19.6) Antibodies to M. hominis as demonstrated by CF tests occurred in nine (33 percent) of 27 women with PID [21], and in 20 (39 percent) of 51 women with PID [9]. IHA antibodies to the organism occurred in 28 (54 percent) of 52 women in whom the diagnosis of PID was verified by laparoscopy, as compared to 11 percent in 56 women in whom laparoscopy showed no infectious conditions, e.g., cysts and endometriosis [12]. Eschenbach et al. [27] found that 17 (22 percent) of 84 PID patients had antibodies to M. hominis. Of 60 consecutive cases with acute salpingitis, IHA antibodies to M. hominis occurred in 24, ten of whom developed a significant titer change [13]. Antibodies to C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae occurred in 80 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of these 60 PID patients. A significant antibody response to these two latter organisms occurred in 20 and three women, respectively [13]. In a series of 166 Danish women with PID, 23 percent showed a significant antibody response to M. hominis. Interestingly, 14.6 percent of the 75 M. hominis culture-negative cases also developed such an antibody response [15] (Table 2).

(p19.7) Increased serum levels of IgM (> 155 mg per 100 ml) was demonstrated in 18 of 53 women with salpingitis and serological evidence of a significant antibody  [33]. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation between the IgM increase and the presence of serum IHA antibodies to M. hominis.

(p19.8) The IgM level of 200-299 itg per 100 ml was found in 11 percent and of > 300 in seven of 53 PID cases. The maximum level was 380 mg per 100 ml. In a few cases there was also a slight increase in the serum IgG and IgA [33].

## (s21) EXPERIMENTAL INFECTION WITH MYCOPLASMA HOMINIS IN MONKEYS
(p21.0) In grivet monekys, parametritis and salpingitis developed within three days when M. hominis was inoculated directly into the fallopian tubes. Thus there was swelling and hyperemia of the tubes and the parametria became edematous. The tubal subserosa was heavily infiltrated with lymphoid cells and an increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In the parametria many lymphocytes and some granulocytes were found, as well as fat necrosis and granulation tissue. After four to five weeks the upper genital tract of the monkeys was virtually normal again [36].
## (s22) ASCENDANT INFECTIONS WITH UREAPLASMA UREAL YTICUM IN NATURALLY ACQUIRED INFECTIONS IN WOMEN AND IN EXPERIMENTAL INFECTIONS IN MONKEYS
(p22.0) U. urealyticum has been recovered from the fallopian tubes [27], from cul-de-sac of a woman with a tubovarian abscess [38], and in a woman with signs of acute salpingitis [11]. A significant antibody response, i.e., of metabolic-inhibition antibodies, to U. urealyticum (to a strain isolated from the fallopian tube of a PID patient) has been demonstrated in one woman with acute salpingitis [24]. Eschenbach et al. [27] found 15 of 204 PID patients to develop ureaplasmacidal antibodies. Sweet et al. [26] found U. urealyticum in cul-de-sac fluid in four of 26 women with PID (also in the fallopian tubes of one of them).
## (s23) SEQUELAE OF MYCOPLASMAL PID
(p23.0) No studies have so far been presented concerning sequelae of PID stratified with regard to the major common etiological agents of PID, including M. hominis. The risk of sterility after PID is known to be high-roughly 10-15 percent after one episode of the disease, 35 percent after two, and 75 percent after three or more such episodes [1]. Chronic abdominal pain and increased risk for etopic pregnancy [49] are other common sequelae after PID. Whether such sequelae also occur after M. hominis-associated PID is not known.
