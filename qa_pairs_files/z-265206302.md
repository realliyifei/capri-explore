## (s7) Comparison to Cervical Cancer
(p7.0) Compared to prostate cancer, cervical cancer is clearly associated with STIs such as Human papillomavirus (HPV) [12].Interestingly, the search term "cervical cancer race" yielded 1990 publications compared with the 4500 terms for prostate cancer.Adding the search term "sexual" to cervical cancer resulted in 225 publications, compared with 157 publications for prostate cancer.
## (s10) Limitations of Our Study
(p10.0) The limitation of our study is that we did not separate publications about Black men only but included the term "race" without specifying further.It would have been a herculean task to analyze 4500 abstracts and classify each publication according to one main topic.Therefore, some publications have appeared in several searches although they have no direct importance to the subject of the publication.Furthermore, we did not include the search term "ethnicity" with nearly 4000 publications.We have, therefore, included some patients of origins other than African, although most studies on race and prostate cancer deal with disparities between Black men and other races.In general, little research has been conducted on other racial disparities outside North America.Therefore, our data are mostly US-specific and cannot necessarily be applied to other countries.There is a growing number of journals, and therefore, publications and research, over the years.Therefore, more recent topics have more publications and a faster uptake per definition than older topics.Healthcare professionals have been shown to exhibit the same level of implicit bias as that of the wider population.It has been observed that patients who experience racism lack trust and experience a delay in seeking healthcare [27].
