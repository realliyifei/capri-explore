## (s2) | Conventional PCR detection
(p2.0) The use of PCR to detect Mycoplasma species from various sample types has demonstrated a higher efficiency, specificity, and sensitivity for laboratory diagnosis when compared with conventional culturebased diagnostic methodologies. 31 Analysis via PCR involves the amplification of the DNA of the target organism, 32 and as such, the organism must be present in the sample with nondegraded DNA for amplification to occur. However, unlike culture, the organism does not need to be viable for detection, which should be taken into consideration if the target is viable organisms only. Assays have been developed to detect individual Mycoplasma species, while some have been developed to identify multiple Mycoplasma species, followed by post-PCR speciation.
