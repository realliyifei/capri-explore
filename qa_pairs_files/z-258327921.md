## (s1) Method
(p1.0) This section introduces the general process of how the search for relevant literature is conducted.The current study applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach (Page et al., 2021).The purpose of searching is to identify all relevant articles to route optimization in ice.The information sources are online databases, including Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science.The queries do not limit time; the latest update was on Jan 01, 2022.

(p1.1) The chosen studies for this review are based on the following eligibility criteria: they have to be related to route optimization in icecovered waters or winter navigation, and the source is published in English.Table 1 shows the search string on selected databases.Besides the search results, some other works, which were mentioned by Lehtola et al. (2019), are included in this set.Fig. 1 illustrates the selection process.

(p1.2) There are two stages of the screening process.The titles and abstracts are scanned in the first stage to filter out the irrelevant articles.The second stage is a full-text screening of potential articles.After determining the shortlist, the data extraction of eligible papers is implemented.The extracted information includes operational objectives of the route optimization, ship performance models, operational constraints in ice, optimization methodology, ice data source, dynamic environment, and type of route validation.
## (s2) Results
(p2.0) There were 265 articles returned from the queries, where 126 papers were from Scopus, 84 papers belonged to Science Direct, and the remaining ones were from Web of Science.The results had 31 duplicate items, so 234 individual articles were examined.The screening based on title and abstract helped exclude 122 articles because they were irrelevant to ice navigation.Their topics are oil spills, fishing decision support systems, and dynamic positioning operations.Subsequently, the remaining 112 articles were reviewed carefully, and only 28 papers were identified as relevant to the current study.The 85 additional works were removed because their main research focus is on ice classification, transportation in open waters or in-land waters, ship performance models, or risk analysis of voyages in ice.Of the twelve papers mentioned by Lehtola et al. (2019), eight already appear in the 28article set, and the remaining four were added.Therefore, this study will review 32 articles in total, where the number of journal articles is while there are 14 conference papers.Fig. 1 describes the process of data collection.Fig. 2 summarizes the number of articles published by year on the route finding for vessels in ice.
## (s7) Route optimization techniques
(p7.0) The optimization algorithm is the core element of the pathfinding system.It processes all input data to search for the best suitable routes according to the predefined constraints and optimized objectives.Multiple techniques were introduced in the literature for the route optimization problem.Each method has advantages and disadvantages based on the focus area of the studies.Among these algorithms, the graphbased method is dominant.

(p7.1) The graph-based algorithm is the most popular technique.It is straightforward to convert a map into a discretized grid world.Each cell plays a node role, and this cell's connectivity to each neighbour creates an edge relation.When the pathfinding problem is formulated as a graph, multiple algorithms can be used to solve for the optimal path, such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithm (e.g.Browne et al., 2022;Choi et al., 2015).The principal idea is to search for the path whose cost is the lowest among the possibilities based on the defined objectives and associated cost function.The cost of the path is the sum of the costs to traverse all nodes along the path.The advantage of graph-based algorithms is that they can solve the problem in linear time proportional to the total number of edges and nodes in the graph.However, a limitation is that the method requires the graph to be known in advance and remain unchanged during the process.

(p7.2) Other optimization methods are used.Frederking (2003) manually applied a ship performance model to compare two candidate routes for a voyage.Waypoints along two routes were predetermined, and the routes were compared considering voyage time, distance, and fuel consumption.It is similar to a divide-and-conquer strategy to find the total cost values of each objective.Despite the manual method, it provides a good strategy and foundation for dealing with a complicated ice regime decomposition.
## (s10) Route validation
(p10.0) The routing system should be validated carefully before being adopted for real-world applications.Validation can have several levels to test effectiveness and accuracy, from simulation to field test, from open water to harsh sea ice environments.In the literature, the validation task is divided into three categories: validation using historical AIS data, validation by a field test, and face validation with experts.

(p10.1) The first approach is the field test.Each ice navigating tool helps determine a suitable route based on assumptions.The assumption could be the known environment as aforementioned.When the tool is applied in reality, the assumption might be invalid, so the route is no longer optimal.For this reason, a field trial for route validation is appropriate to check the reliability.However, conducting a field test validation may not be feasible.It can be costly to have multiple vessels run on multiple routes simultaneously for one scenario to compare performance.Another issue is that when a ship faces an unexpected navigational challenge, the captain might change the route to maintain safety.Only Jeong et al. (2018) conducted a real voyage for validation.They had five trial groups in five different ice conditions from 75 o N to 78 o N. The validation results showed that the mismatching between estimated speed and actual speed varied from 0 to 50%.

(p10.2) Due to the difficulties of field testing, some researchers chose to validate optimized routes with historical AIS data for similar voyages (Guinness, 2014;Kotovirta et al., 2009;Lehtola et al., 2019;Mishra et al., 2021).The advantage of this approach is that the route optimization can be tested against known ice conditions.It provides a reference for the comparison of a voyage for a specific vessel using historical AIS data.However, when comparing against AIS data, an assumption is that the navigators on that ship perform perfectly.In other words, the AIS routes are assumed to be optimal routes.If the optimized route matches the AIS data, the pathfinding performance is considered to be as good as a human decision-maker.If the optimized route is different from the AIS data, the pathfinding performance is considered to be poor.However, it could be that the AIS data reflect a non-optimal route.When using AIS data, it is crucial to consider the reference vessels and ensure the AIS data reflects a similar ice class and operation in similar ice conditions as the testing vessel.

(p10.3) The third validation method is face validation by consulting the ice navigation experts (Browne et al., 2022;Lehtola et al., 2019).Lehtola et al. (2020) described details of how a validation process for a route optimization tool is conducted with sea captains.All essential information is given to the experienced captains and seafarers and they are asked how they plan routes.The other form of this validation method is showing the expert the proposed routes of the tools and asking for feedback.This category is advantageous because the routes are validated directly by end-users.If the expert agrees with the route selection, the tool gains more trust for implementation.The approach is also helpful when validation is conducted in a wide range of scenarios where no or few voyages are taken.The downside is that the test might miss some uncertain factors.

(p10.4) In summary, different approaches for validation are available in the literature.Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages.Future research might combine them to boost the effectiveness and reliability of the routing tool.
## (s12) Conclusion
(p12.0) A literature review on pathfinding and optimization for vessels in ice was performed in this study.A total of 32 articles was analyzed to address seven research questions.The dataset was sourced from Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, plus articles found in the review section of Lehtola et al. (2019).A limitation of the current study is that it does not consider literature from other sources.The research questions are related to the objectives, ship performance model, operational constraints, optimization methods, sources of ice data, temporal changes in the environment, and route validation.The findings of these questions are as follows.The main objectives for the route optimization problem are voyage distance, voyage time, and fuel consumption.Individual studies consider either one, two, or three of these operational objectives.The ship performance models and ice input data are various and depend on the application.Regarding the route optimization method, the graphbased algorithm is widely used in the research literature.The temporal changes in the environment and route validation are important, but just a few studies considered them.In conclusion, this review provides some insights into the route optimization for vessels in ice-covered waters.The suggested directions for subsequent research are to implement more operational constraints and to treat the ice navigating problem under uncertainties.
