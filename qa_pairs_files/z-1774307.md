## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have undergone numerous changes since they were introduced over 50 years ago. Early COCs consisted of 28-day pill packs, typically known as 21/7 COC regimens 1 . Such regimens, still in widespread use, provide 21 days of active combination hormone pills followed by a hormone-free interval (HFI) of seven placebo pills 2,3 . The aim of these regimens is to induce withdrawal bleeding every 28 days, which historically has served to mimic a monthly menstrual cycle and reassure the user that she is not pregnant [1][2][3] . Several variations of the original 21/7 regimen, which maintain a 28-day cycle but have fewer hormone-free days (i.e., 24/4 and 26/2), are now available and offer the benefits of shorter, lighter withdrawal bleeds [4][5][6] . It is recognised, however, that monthly withdrawal bleeds in any form are unnecessary and often inconvenient. Moreover, hormone withdrawal during the HFI may increase the risk of escape ovulation and induce a variety of symptoms, such as headaches, bloating and pelvic pain 1,[7][8][9][10][11] .

(p0.1) One strategy to minimise withdrawal bleeding and maintain ovarian suppression has been to extend the COC cycle beyond 28 days. In this increasingly popular strategy, the number of active pills administered per cycle and the amount of time between HFIs is increased 12 . By extending the time between scheduled bleeding episodes, an important objective is achieved: namely, the total number of scheduled bleeding episodes is reduced 13 . Extended regimen COCs may reduce the interference of scheduled bleeding with daily activities, such as sexual activity, exercise, sports and work (including menstruation-related absence from work) and reduce the costs and inconvenience associated with feminine hygiene products [14][15][16][17][18] .

(p0.2) In addition to allow women the option to avoid menstruation, extended, flexible-extended and continuous regimens have become recognised in recent years as useful approaches to treat endometriosis, dysmenorrhoea and menstrual-related symptoms 16,[19][20][21][22][23] . Given these various positive attributes, one might possibly expect the adoption of extended regimen COCs to be nearly universal; however, there is evidence to suggest that such regimens are underused [24][25][26] . We were interested, therefore, to understand whether attitudes or perceptions of women and clinicians constituted barriers to the use of extended regimen COCs.

(p0.3) The objective of this review is to summarise the available information on: (1) the evolution and rationale for extended regimen COCs, considering their efficacy, safety and clinical utility; (2) women's and clinicians' attitudes towards extended regimen COCs; and (3) strategies for improving communication about COC options to increase awareness among clinicians and women about the potential benefits of extended regimen COCs.
## (s1) Methods
(p1.0) Focusing on women's and clinicians' attitudes and usage patterns related to extended or flexible regimen COCs, we collected relevant information for our review by performing a MEDLINE search of articles published in English between 1970 and 2014. We used the following search strategy: oral AND (contraception OR contraceptives) AND (extended regimens OR flexible regimens) AND (attitudes OR satisfaction OR adherence OR efficacy OR compliance OR counselling OR education). Of the 160 articles screened, 96 were included in the analysis (Figure 1). Reference lists of the retrieved articles were also reviewed to identify references not found using electronic search methods.

(p1.1) Although there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an extended COC regimen, we defined such regimens for the purpose of this review as those that include more than 28 days' COC pills followed by 7 or fewer days of no pills, placebo or low-dose ethinylestradiol (EE). We also included flexible-extended regimens, whereby users take COCs continuously until they experience persistent unscheduled bleeding, and then begin an HFI of 7 or fewer days 27 . These extended and flexible-extended regimens differ from continuous regimens, which provide uninterrupted COCs for 1 year or more without an HFI 2,27 and are not the focus of this article. Furthermore, we evaluated review articles on these topics and their reference lists to identify additional relevant manuscripts.
## (s2) Results and discussion
(p2.0) Rationale for extended regimen COCs: efficacy, safety and clinical utility One of the most important and recognisable trends in the evolution of COCs has been the reduction in hormone dosages to lower the risk of thrombotic events 2 . However, while the lower hormone dosages in today's COCs are associated with a lower risk of thrombotic events, they also have the potential to increase the risk of follicular activity and escape ovulation, particularly during the traditional 7-day HFI 9,28 . In fact, follicular growth taking place during the 7-day HFI resembles that seen during the early follicular phase of a spontaneous menstrual cycle 29,30 .

(p2.1) The limitations of the 7-day HFI prompted development of various regimens, including those with a shortened HFI (i.e., 24/4 and 26/2 regimens), regimens that substitute low-dose EE for the HFI and extended regimen COCs, which are the focus of this review. Each of these strategies has been shown to provide greater pituitary-ovarian suppression, reduce follicular development and the risk of contraceptive failure and decrease the incidence of symptoms related to hormone withdrawal 9,19,31-33 . 
## (s5) Bleeding patterns
(p5.0) Since a major goal of extended regimen COCs is to reduce the incidence of scheduled withdrawal bleeds as well as overall bleeding, most studies evaluating the effectiveness of extended regimens have also included bleeding patterns as an outcome 15,27,[34][35][36][37]45 . Moreover, since 'escape' follicular development and bleeding patterns are often linked, the two systematic reviews mentioned previously also address bleeding outcomes 16,42 .

(p5.1) A recent Cochrane review by Edelman and colleagues 16 concluded that most trials found either no difference or less bleeding and/or spotting with extended/continuous vs. cyclical regimens, although most users of extended regimen COCs will experience occasional unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding or spotting.

(p5.2) Although most studies report an increased incidence of unscheduled bleeding with extended regimens during early cycles 16,42 , it has also been consistently documented that the frequency and intensity of such bleeding decreases over time 42 . By the fourth extended cycle, the incidence of unscheduled bleeding is generally comparable to that seen among users of conventional cyclical regimens 34,46 .
## (s6) Safety
(p6.0) Considering that some extended regimen COCs may provide a greater cumulative oestrogen dose compared with similarly dosed cyclical regimens, women and clinicians may be concerned that extended regimens may increase certain safety risks. Accumulating data, however, provide reassurance regarding the safety of long-term use of extended regimen COCs 16,[47][48][49] . Current evidence suggests that adverse events associated with extended regimens are similar to those seen with 28-day cyclical regimens. There is also no evidence that the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction or thrombosis is increased with extended regimens compared with 28-day regimens 42 .
## (s7) Potential for fewer hormone withdrawal symptoms
(p7.0) Since the incidence of symptoms associated with hormone withdrawal and menstruation is related to the number of hormone withdrawal episodes, as the number of such episodes decreases so should their associated symptoms 16,42 . Extended regimens clearly improve dysmenorrhoea by decreasing the total number of withdrawal bleeds 42 . In an early study of 84 days' EE and lynestrenol and 7 days' placebo, 20% of participating women had fewer menstrual symptoms compared with their previous pill regimen 50 . These benefits are particularly apparent among women who experience premenstrual syndrome or symptoms associated with the HFI when using conventional regimens 42 .

(p7.1) In a study of the use of extended regimens to delay withdrawal bleeding and reduce hormone withdrawal symptoms, 41-86% of women who chose extended regimen COCs experienced an improvement in their symptoms 51 . Among the 59% of women who chose to continue using extended regimen COCs, 94% reported improvement in their quality of life 51 .

(p7.2) In one study of adolescents who adhered to an extended regimen, the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea decreased by 56%, spending on painkillers decreased by 75% and absenteeism from work and school decreased by 92% 52 .
## (s8) Bleeding preferences
(p8.0) Many women would prefer to eliminate or reduce the frequency of scheduled bleeding if given the choice (Table 1) 25,26 . In one of the first studies to evaluate an 84/7 COC regimen, 82% of 196 participants welcomed having fewer withdrawal bleeds; both women and clinicians appreciated this and other aspects related to taking an extended regimen COC 50 . Although the lack of scheduled bleeding was disturbing to some, many women and clinicians felt this regimen was easier to follow and was well accepted. In fact, 91% of women still using the extended regimen at the end of the study refused to revert to the standard monthly regimen 50 .

(p8.1) According to a 2007 Canadian consensus statement, extended regimens are also associated with a greater reduction in the use of hygiene products compared with conventional cycles 42,53 . The lower use of these products and lower associated out-of-pocket expenses constitute yet another reason for women to prefer extended regimen COCs. Moreover, the increased number of tablets consumed does not appear to increase the overall costs of these regimens 42 .

(p8.2) Reduced withdrawal bleeding may also reduce the risk of anaemia in women using extended COC regimens. A recent study indicated, however, that relatively few women are aware of this potential benefit 54 .
## (s9) Adherence and satisfaction
(p9.0) Missed pills, in the real world, particularly those missed during the first week of COC use, may increase the risk of follicular development and cause contraceptive failure 9, 10 . It has been hypothesised that when extended regimen COCs are used to avoid menstruation for convenience or personal preference, they may lead to improved adherence and greater user satisfaction due to a reduction in the number of hormone withdrawal episodes and greater number of active pills available 42,46 . In one survey of 617 gynaecologists following 3316 women throughout France, 23% of women using conventional COCs reported missing a pill at least once during a 28-day cycle, and 42% of women who missed a pill did so during the first week following the HFI 55 . This led the authors to conclude that, by reducing the opportunity to *Percentages may not total 100% due to women who did not answer the question.

(p9.1) NR, not reported. miss pills during the first week of the cycle, using continuous regimens might improve compliance. Despite this, a recent Cochrane analysis found no difference in compliance or adherence between users of extended or continuous regimen COCs when patient compliance was reported 16 . User satisfaction could possibly be considered a proxy for user adherence. Indeed, high user satisfaction has been consistently reported with extended regimen COCs 16,27,34,42,56,57 , and this satisfaction typically increases as the number of bleeding episodes decreases 58 . By contrast, another study with a flexible-extended regimen COC reported lower satisfaction with continuous than with cyclical COCs, both with regard to satisfaction with bleeding outcomes and overall satisfaction 57 . It is noteworthy, however, that survey data indicate that the majority of women using hormonal contraceptives would accept unpredictable bleeding initially if they had fewer withdrawal bleeds over time 59 .

(p9.2) In an early study of Dutch women's preferences, 81% of those surveyed would prefer to modify their menstrual cycle (less painful, shorter or lighter periods). Most of these women preferred to have a bleeding frequency of less than once a month or never 60 . Approximately two-thirds of reproductive aged women surveyed in Germany indicated they would prefer to bleed less frequently than monthly, and 37-46% would prefer never to bleed 61 . Among 350 Italian women of reproductive age, only 32% indicated a preference to bleed monthly, whereas 68% preferred to bleed less than once a month 62 . Among COC users, approximately 57% preferred to bleed less than once a month and 26% preferred to bleed every 3 months 62 .

(p9.3) Contemporary Swiss women have similar attitudes towards menstrual bleeding. A recent study reported that 32% preferred to bleed every 2-6 months and 29% preferred not to bleed at all 63 . Interestingly, preferences for bleeding frequency in this study did not appear to differ between women who experienced menstrual symptoms and those who did not. The findings of this survey suggested that predictability of bleeding may be more important for some women than the ability to postpone it. Indeed, more than 80% of women felt that the predictability of bleeding and avoidance of unscheduled bleeding were very important 63 .

(p9.4) A desire for less frequent bleeding is not limited to women who experience symptoms related to menstruation or withdrawal bleeding. In one study of 270 women without menstrual symptoms, 76% reported that menstrual periods interfered with their sexual life, 29% preferred not having their period at work and 48% felt that menstruation interfered with their sporting activities 18 . If given the choice, more than half of the participants indicated that they would prefer less frequent periods 18 . Of these women who would prefer less frequent periods, half would prefer amenorrhoea. Importantly, 73% of the women who preferred a reduction in menstrual frequency said they would use a drug to accomplish this 18 .

(p9.5) Data indicate that many women have already used COCs to delay bleeding, suggesting that many would welcome a COC option that modified the frequency of their scheduled bleeding episodes. A 2008 survey reported that approximately one-third of Italian COC users had modified their COC regimen to delay the occurrence of withdrawal bleeding 62 . A more recent survey of US university students found that 17% of respondents had altered their scheduled bleeding pattern by deviating from the instructions in the package insert 26 . While women who preferred a structured schedule and consistent monthly cycles were less likely to manipulate the timing of their scheduled bleeding, women who were older, those who used oral (but not transdermal or vaginal) contraceptives and those who preferred to bleed less frequently were more likely to report manipulating their COC schedule 26 . Clinicians providing guidance regarding the off-label manipulation of 28-day COC formulations to approximate extended regimens should consider the possibility that this practice may result in misuse, potentially increasing the risk of contraceptive failure.
## (s11) Awareness and knowledge
(p11.0) Despite the consistent survey data demonstrating that the majority of reproductive aged women preferred to bleed less often than monthly 25,26,56,64 , a US-based study found that 73% of women had never even heard of using COCs to manipulate their monthly bleeding episodes 25 . Of concern, only half of the university students surveyed by Lakehomer et al. 26 in a US study reported learning about cycle manipulation from health care providers (HCPs). Another study of family planning clinics in London revealed that extended regimen COCs were discussed with as few as 6% of women attending centres that provided specialist contraceptive services 65 . This finding is corroborated by previous research from Spain that demonstrated that 90% of women had never been offered the option to suppress monthly bleeding by their gynaecologist 66 . A lack of discussion or recommendation for extended regimens by HCPs, particularly in certain European countries, may be explained, at least in part, by the lack of availability of approved extended regimen COCs.

(p11.1) In the US, where several extended regimen COCs are approved for use, it appears that only 2.5% of women prescribed COCs are prescribed an extended regimen COC 24 . Although this figure may not represent their actual use, it is evident that many women interested in menstrual suppression are not offered extended regimen COCs by their HCPs.
## (s13) Strategies for improving communication about extended regimen COCs
(p13.0) Concerns regarding the use of extended regimen COCs can likely be addressed through effective counselling. Research has shown that clinicians who use a structured, patientcentred approach to contraceptive counselling that includes shared decision-making may influence contraceptive use, and it is an approach preferred by women [84][85][86][87] . Shared decisionmaking represents an approach that considers patient preferences and respects patient autonomy, using a structure that enables clinicians to emphasise highly effective contraceptives while considering the woman's preferences 84 . Preliminary data suggest that approaches involving the tenets of shared decision-making may increase the use of effective contraception 85 , but data on their impact on extended regimen COC use is lacking. Studies of interventions designed to improve the delivery of information about contraception have been limited and mostly unsuccessful 84,88 , but several best practices have been proposed for general contraceptive counselling.
