## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) The primary area of intelligent and networked development in the vehicle and transportation industries is autonomous driving. AVs have the potential to fundamentally alter transportation systems by averting deadly crashes, providing critical mobility to the elderly and disabled, increasing road capacity, saving fuel, and lowering emissions [1,2]. The vehicle perception system's accurate perception of the environment is essential for safe autonomous driving. The perception of autonomous driving settings depends heavily on object tracking, a high-level vision job in the discipline of computer vision. As a result, the development of an object tracking algorithm ensures the development of an automatic driving system that is both safer and more effective.

(p0.1) This section of the review focuses on multi-object tracking in autonomous driving systems. Multi-object tracking is crucial to ensuring the effectiveness and safety of autonomous driving because it is the fundamental component of the technology. Rarely do objects in traffic situations appear alone. Autonomous driving frequently involves recognizing and tracking many things at once, some of which may be moving in relation to the vehicle or to one another. The majority of techniques in the related literature therefore deal with many objects and attempt to address the multi-object tracking issue. In essence, The research on multi-object tracking for autonomous drivi cantly in recent years, but it is still challenging to use the curre techniques for autonomous driving to their full potential becaus varied shapes of cars and pedestrians in traffic scenes, motion b terference.

(p0.2) This paper introduces algorithms that perform multi-object bilities of deep learning models, concentrating on several appro The research on multi-object tracking for autonomous driving has advanced significantly in recent years, but it is still challenging to use the current multi-object tracking techniques for autonomous driving to their full potential because of issues including the varied shapes of cars and pedestrians in traffic scenes, motion blur, and background interference. There are still several difficulties with the existing visual multi-object tracking technology. Visual multi-object tracking must first address more challenging problems such as: an unpredictable number of objects, frequent object occlusion, challenging object differentiation, etc. In particular, the frequent entry and exit of objects from the field of view is a typical and expected behavior in autonomous driving applications, which results in the uncertainty of the number of objects faced by multi-object tracking and necessitates realtime detection of multi-object tracking algorithms. The method must extract robust object features and keep the object-specific ID after occlusion in complicated situations, since the occlusion of an object by other objects or backgrounds will lead to object ID switches (IDs). The high degree of similarity in object appearance also adds to the difficulty of maintaining the right object ID over the long term. The algorithm must be able to extract the characteristics of comparable items that make them separable. Finally, the challenges that multi-object tracking in autonomous vehicles face can be broken down into two categories: the tracking object factor and the backdrop factor. Shape change, scale change, motion blur, etc. are some of the issues brought on by the object's factors. The impact of backdrop elements is also substantial, particularly the blurring of background interference, occlusion and disappearance of objects, changes in weather, comparable background interference, etc. [4].
## (s5) Review Planning
(p5.0) The study's methodology is based on a systematic review strategy, which is a way to examine and assess the prior literature in relation to the features of the current research. The preparation for the review, the review, and the production of the summary review report are its three main phases. The researchers included 98 studies from the field of visual multi-object tracking that used deep learning in their review of video multi-object tracking under autonomous driving. To finish the article, we first concentrated on the overall autonomous driving field before focusing our search only on the use of deep learning for visual multi-object tracking. The remaining papers were eliminated, and only English full-text publications published in significant journals and conferences between 2012 and 2022 were chosen. To lessen the likelihood of researcher bias, a review strategy must be chosen before a systematic review [10]. We came up with our own overview strategy. First, depending on the goal of the review, we determined the study questions and scope (Section 2.2). In order to identify the final search character and search range, we then executed our search strategy in the database using research questions (Section 2.3). After that, criteria for research selection were established to decide which publications were included or eliminated from the investigation (Section 2.4). After that, we extracted and categorized the data from the pertinent papers. The multi-object tracking algorithms are divided into TBD, JDT, and Transformer-based tracking methods, based on the outcomes of data categorization and the various network structures of the tracking algorithms (Section 2.5). Finally, in Sections 4-6, we compare and contrast the visual multi-object tracking algorithms of the three frameworks, provide our summaries, and offer our recommendations for the way forward (Section 8).
## (s25) TBD Algorithm Based on Deep Learning Object Detection
(p25.0) Obtaining detection results is the first step in TBD, as already discussed. The results of the object detection have a significant impact on how well the TBD framework tracks objects. There are currently many object detection research findings that are rather advanced [35]. Traditional object detection techniques frequently rely on manually created feature operators to describe images. Examples include SIFT features [36], histogram of gradient directions HOG features [37], etc. However, the results of many related works of literature have demonstrated that compared to traditional algorithms for learning features, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have the strongest feature representation capability and contain the most feature information compared to traditional algorithms learning features.
## (s26) TBD Algorithm Based on Deep Learning Object Detection
(p26.0) Obtaining detection results is the first step in TBD, as already discussed. The results of the object detection have a significant impact on how well the TBD framework tracks objects. There are currently many object detection research findings that are rather advanced [35]. Traditional object detection techniques frequently rely on manually created feature operators to describe images.

## (s28) SORT-Based Object Tracking
(p28.0) The SORT [50] object tracking algorithm is an online, real-time, multi-object tracking algorithm that incorporates correlation filters into a deep learning algorithm. It predicts the current position using a Kalman filter, correlates the detection frames and objects by correlation, and uses the Intersection over Union (IoU) between each detection and all predicted bounding boxes of an existing object as a metric for the object relationship between the preceding and following frames. Although the object tracking method for SORT is quick, it scarcely addresses object occlusion, leading to a large number of ID switches; accuracy is good in the absence of occlusion but low in the presence of occlusion.
## (s29) LSTM-Based Object Tracking
(p29.0) Multiple studies in the literature have demonstrated that LSTM-based methods have the potential to ensure the correct processing of long-term dependencies while successfully resolving the issue of gradient disappearance and explosion in neural networks through its "gate units." LSTM-related data association techniques have been applied to the field of multi-object tracking [60].

(p29.1) Most LSTM-based techniques for tracking objects combine several classifiers that deal with space and shape with LSTM modules that take temporal consistency into account [61][62][63]. A long-term tracking solution based on the characteristics collected by the LSTM layer was provided by MILAN et al. [64] who employed an LSTM-based classifier to track objects in a video sequence and realized the re-tracking of items that disappeared and reappeared in the video frequency. While the algorithm performed favorably to other techniques, including the combination of a Kalman filter with the Hungarian algorithm, the results on the MOT15 test set did not quite reach top accuracy; however, the algorithm was able to run much faster than other algorithms (~165 FPS) and did not use any kind of appearance features, leaving room for future improvements. This idea was further explored by [65] who employed a bilinear LSTM network, where one LSTM network tracks motion and the other handles information about object interactions, to identify numerous cues for evaluating long-term relationships. The results of the performance comparison reveal that the approach has stronger robustness and better performance than conventional methods, such as the Hungarian and JPDA algorithms. These two elements are combined to determine the similarity score between frames. Another method of using multiple LSTMs is [66]. Ran et al. proposed a triple-stream network based on pose, which combines three other affinity outputs of three LSTMs to calculate affinity: one for appearance similarity, using CNN features and pose information extracted by AlphaPose [67], one for motion similarity, using posture joint speed, and one for interactive similarity, using an interactive grid. Then, a custom tracking algorithm is used to correlate the detection. When tracking multiple objects, the tracker remembers each object's appearance and motion information. This memory is used to compare trajectory and prediction matching and is updated as a result. In order to overcome the issue of simultaneously taking into account all tracks in the memory update process, Kim et al. [68] added a novel multi-track pooling module to the original model structure, which solved the problem and only added a minor amount of cost.
## (s32) Fusion Detection and Tracking Module
(p32.0) The front-end object detection network significantly affects how well multi-object tracking functions, as can be shown from the analysis above. In order to further increase algorithm simplicity, weight sharing between the two phases of detection and tracking is realized, and the high-performance object detection network is improved to support multiple objects tracking tasks. Recently, research on object tracking algorithms has turned its attention to fusion of multi-object tracking algorithm modules.

(p32.1) Feichtenhofer et al. [11] initially proposed to include the object detection network in the tracking branch in 2017. They then implemented the main line detection task using an improved R-FCN algorithm, interacted with the multiscale feature maps of the first stage
