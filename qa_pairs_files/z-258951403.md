(p20.0) Considering the intricacies associated with the customization of Upper Limb Prosthetic (ULP) sockets, it is challenging to achieve economies of scale through traditional manufacturing methods. Despite the perceived advantages of mass production, the cost per unit remains high due to the individualized nature of these devices. However, 3D printing, often touted as a cost-effective solution, also presents challenges. As indicated in the review by Ten Kate, Smit and Breedveld, the affordability of 3D printing is often overstated. The costs associated with 3D printing can escalate when factoring in the limitations of the materials that can be utilized in the process [1].

(p20.1) Material limitations pose a significant challenge for 3D printing. The palette of materials suitable for 3D printing is restricted, which can impede the creation of devices that necessitate special, non-printable materials or components. Although there is a continuous influx of new materials suitable for 3D printing, certain substances, including various fabrics, remain unprintable, thus presenting further obstacles.

(p20.2) Given these constraints, future research should explore a modular design approach. This would entail combining traditional manufacturing methods with more appropriate materials for the standard sections of the prosthetic. Meanwhile, 3D printing could be strategically employed for the parts of the prosthetic that require personalization and frequent replacement. This hybrid approach might provide the best solution, blending the reliability and material versatility of conventional manufacturing with the customization possibilities of 3D printing.

(p20.3) In conclusion, the application of 3D printing technology for ULP socket design and manufacturing has demonstrated promising advantages, including customization, rapid prototyping, cost-effectiveness, diverse material selection, and increased accessibility. However, it is essential to address the current limitations and challenges associated with material properties, post-processing, quality control, skill requirements, and regulatory issues to fully realize its potential in improving the lives of amputees worldwide.
