## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) According to statistics, millions of people are killed and millions of people are injured in traffic accidents worldwide every year.Especially in developing countries, the incidence of traffic accidents is even higher.Against this background, predicting and preventing traffic accidents has become a hot topic of research.Traffic accidents are a complex problem that is influenced by many factors, such as road conditions, vehicle type, weather conditions, driver behaviour, etc [1].Traditional traffic accident research methods usually use statistical analysis, but this method has limited prediction accuracy and lacks a comprehensive analysis of multiple factors.With the continuous development of computer technology, traditional statistical analysis methods, machine learning methods, neural network methods, time series analysis methods and techniques based on spatio-temporal data mining are widely used in the field of traffic accident prediction.This paper will introduce the current research status of traffic accident prediction techniques, including traditional statistical analysis methods, machine learning methods, time series analysis methods, and techniques based on spatio-temporal data mining.By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, the application scenarios and development trends of traffic accident prediction techniques can be better understood.
