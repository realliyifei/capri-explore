## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Electrification of vehicles is a primary way to facilitate the automotive industry reaching the goal of net-zero carbon emission [1] and contributing to more sustainable transport.The shift towards electrification and autonomous driving in the current automotive industry stresses the increasing significance of the automotive electronic system, which is responsible for quality-essential processes, for example, engine control unit and energy transmission system, and safety-critical functions, for instance, maneuvering, driver assistance, and safety system [2].
## (s4) Automation challenges in wire harness assembly
(p4.0) Automated assembly has been adopted in the automotive industry for years to fulfill the continuously-increasing demand for quality and productivity and relieve more and more ergonomic problems [13,11,12,26].However, among other assembly operations, most of the current operations of wire harness assembly remain manual and challenging to be automated [12].

(p4.1) Theoretically, a wire harness can be generalized as a Deformable Linear Object (DLO) [27], and wire harness assembly can be regarded as a specific task of DLO manipulation, which is one of the remaining challenges in the robot-centered flexible automation, although tremendous achievements in recent years have promoted the capability of robots [19].In particular, challenges in DLO manipulation exists in modeling, state estimation, and operation [19,28].On the other hand, methods and strategies designed for manipulating regular rigid objects cannot be adapted for DLO manipulation directly due to the high degrees of freedom and deformability of DLOs [29,19].

(p4.2) Similarly, automating the assembly of wire harnesses is particularly difficult because it is hard to recognize the long and uneven shape, estimate the state of a deformable wire harness, and control the force for manipulation due to the property of flexibility of wire harnesses [13], as well as it is usually complex to design paths avoiding the formation of knots and entanglements which could block the process or break the harness.The flexible characteristics of the cables make the presentation of material to the automotive system very challenging.Additionally, it is generally required to deal with extremely tight position accuracy, complex structures of connectors, and non-rigid materials for connector mating in the automated mating of electric connectors [10].The previous research proposals depend on the availability of precise contactless measurement to the state of the target wire in real-time significantly, which makes many proposals challenging to implement and unreliable in actual production [30].
## (s6) Literature search
(p6.0) The literature search was conducted on the Scopus database.Scopus was selected as the online database for searching scientific peer-reviewed articles considering it as a de facto reference standard for the engineering community [34] and its adequate coverage of publications provided by various publishers.It is preferred because of its higher inclusiveness in terms of contributions over the Web of Science database and its higher reliability of collected peer-reviewed sources over Google Scholar [35].To ensure identifying as many relevant articles as possible to our research questions, the co-authors deliberated the keywords and string for searching and inclusion and exclusion criteria for scrutinizing.After several search trials with different combinations of keywords, the following string was defined for the search within the field of Article title, Abstract, Keywords on Scopus: (wir* OR cabl*) AND (harness* OR bundl*) AND assembl*, where the asterisk character was used to retrieve more results based on variations of the term and the words "cable" and "bundle" were included as synonyms of "wire" and "harness".The initial search returned a set of 990 items.A filter on the subject area was conducted on the initial search and limited to Engineering, Computer Science, Decision Sciences, Multidisciplinary, and Business, Management and Accounting to exclude studies referring to irrelevant subjects, which reduced the number of items to 711.The language of the article was also limited to English.In addition, no filter regarding the year of publication was implemented, that is, all past research works were kept for screening.Finally, there were 645 articles identified based on the search strategy on February 2, 2023.
## (s7) Literature selection
(p7.0) After the literature search, a two-step screening was conducted by three researchers regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria shown in Table 1 to select the literature for later data synthesis and analysis.Firstly, a study would be excluded if it did not regard wire harnesses, as described in Section 1, as the object of interest to the study.A study would also be excluded if no robot system was involved in the proposed solution for wire harness assembly.Then, as clarified in Section 1, articles that proposed computer vision-based solutions for robotized assembly of wire harnesses would be qualified for the analysis in this study, while articles presenting studies that focused on the manufacturing of wire harnesses would be excluded from the analysis.

(p7.1) In the first round of screening, the title and abstract of the 645 articles were initially examined by three researchers independently based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria to minimize subjective bias during screening.After the respective screening, all three researchers synchronized their opinions and fixed disagreements by consensus.Firstly, 439 articles were excluded because they were not about the wire harnesses focused in this review.Then, 92 articles were excluded because no robotized assembly was involved.Furthermore, 82 articles were excluded because they addressed the robotized assembly process in the manufacturing of wire harnesses.Lastly, 12 articles were excluded because they addressed robotized wire harness assembly without proposing vision-based solutions.After the first screening on title and abstract, there were 625 articles excluded, and, thus, 20 articles qualified, whose full texts were downloaded and evaluated in the second round of screening.

(p7.2) In the second screening, the full texts of downloaded articles were scrutinized meticulously according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria to filter the articles for later analysis.After the second screening, there were 12 articles left for full-text analysis.

(p7.3) Moreover, "snowballing" [36], including reference tracking and citation tracking, was implemented on the selected 12 articles for analysis to identify other relevant articles missed in the original search, which returned two more articles.Thus, there were 14 peer-reviewed scientific articles selected for further extensive, qualitative descriptive, and quantitative data synthesis and analysis.
## (s10) Clamp manipulation
(p10.0) Clamps are bound on wire harnesses for attaching wire harnesses to target positions.Four reviewed articles addressed the manipulation of clamps on wire harnesses achieved with computer vision-based clamp recognition, as summarized in Table 3.

(p10.1) This group of articles focused on the mating of wire harnesses onto a car body, for example, inserting the clamps on a wire harness into an instrument panel frame.In these proposals, clamps were recognized using CCD camera [13,11,12] and CMOS camera [30] so that the gripper or end-effector on a robot arm could reach the clamps for further manipulations.All four studies implemented hand-eye vision systems by mounting cameras on the end-effectors of robot arms [13,11,12,30].Two of them also adopted global vision systems with multiple cameras fixed around the operation area [11,12].

(p10.2) Although the clamps can be regarded as rigid objects, their relatively small sizes and complex shapes make them difficult to be grasped by a robot gripper directly [13].The complexity of control program development and the insufficiency of the payload make multi-finger robot hands difficult to be adapted in practical applications [13].Thus, Koo et al. [13] proposed to install cubic clamp covers to facilitate the manipulation of clamps with small sizes and complex shapes and introduce stereo vision systems mounted on the end-effectors of two robot arms to recognize [13] [11]
## (s12) Mating of connectors
(p12.0) Mating of connectors is critical in the final assembly of wire harnesses in terms of function and quality.Table 4 summarizes the seven articles focusing on different stages of the mating of connectors, which can be grouped into three sub-procedures: (1) pre-assembly; (2) mating; and (3) post-assembly.Pre-assembly is the initial process where the vision system acquires the necessary information to guide the movement of a robot toward connectors and the later robotized mating operation.There were five articles discussing various tasks in pre-assembly, including connector detection [39,17,19], pose estimation [19], and fault detection [38,10].
## (s14) Research on operations of wire harness assembly
(p14.0) The identified studies can also be synthesized regarding to which operation of wire harness assembly the proposed vision systems contributed, as shown in Table 6.The majority of previous research discussed computer vision techniques for the assembly procedure, including four studies on the fixing of clamps [13,11,12,30] and seven studies on the mating of connectors [38,10,16,39,40,17,19].The interpretable classification of wire harness branches explored in Kicki et al. [20] and the recognition method for wires proposed in Guo et al. [18] can support the robotic routing with a better understanding of the topology of wire harnesses.Koo et al. [13], Jiang et al. [11], and Jiang et al. [12] proposed to install covers on clamps to facilitate the detection and manipulation of clamps on wire harnesses, which, on the other hand, can also assist the robotic routing of wire harnesses by locating the positions of clamps.However, as summarized in Section 2.1, there are also other operations within the overall wire harness assembly onto vehicles, such as preparation, transport, and disentanglement, which gained little attentions [21].

(p14.1) Since the wire harness is processed as a pack in the operation of preparation and transport, the task for the vision system will mainly be identifying the pack of wire harnesses and the location for dropping it.However, the disentanglement of wire harnesses leads to more problems requiring future research because a dynamic robotic manipulation strategy is needed so that the robot system can react to the deformation of wire harnesses, which stresses the significance of the real-time tracking of the wire harness.
## (s16) Discussion
(p16.0) In general, computer vision-based methods proposed in previous research efforts were designed for a better visual machine perception on different levels of constituent structure of wire harnesses so that the control system of robotized wire harness assembly could estimate the state of assembly autonomously for various tasks, including manipulation of different components of wire harnesses [13,38,10,11,12,16,39,30,40,17,19], monitoring sub-processes of the assembly [38,16,40,20,18], and fault detection in the assembly [38].These solutions were mainly achieved with vision-based classification and detection on various components of wire harnesses, such as clamps [13,11,12,30], connectors [38,10,16,39,40,17,19], and wires [20,18,21].The proposed vision systems also contributed to different operations regarding current work instructions for wire harness assembly in practical production, including disentanglement [21], routing [13,11,12,20,18], and assembly [13,11,12,30,38,10,16,39,40,17,19].Nevertheless, these existing studies have also implied challenges and opportunities for future research toward more efficient and practical computer vision-driven robotized wire harness assembly.
## (s17) Object recognition and detection algorithms
(p17.0) Computer vision techniques have been implemented in various industrial manufacturing systems to promote the level of informatization, digitization, and intelligence [15].Increasing research efforts in computer vision and robotics have paid attention to the complex DLO manipulation, addressing both theoretical research [52,53,54] and engineering practices [38,12,30,29,18].

(p17.1) However, for robotized wire harness assembly, it is necessary to recognize wire harnesses successfully within a limited processing time in order to conduct planning and control of automated manipulation under constrained production rate [18].Besides, estimating the shape of a wire harness by a totally vision-based algorithm in practical applications in an actual production plant indicates extracting image features from an intricate background [13].On the other hand, the automotive industry has not identified a satisfactory vision-based automation solution that can recognize different components of a wire harness as robustly as humans, especially under hardly consistent production configuration in practical manufacturing, which has attracted plenty of studies on wire harness component recognition in the past few years [13,11,12,30,38,10,16,39,40,17,19,20,18,21].

(p17.2) Previously, clamp detection was achieved with the assistance of clamp covers with a unique design and markers [13,11,12,30].The clamp covers can facilitate the recognition and manipulation of clamps with relatively small sizes and complex structures.However, the clamp covers can be problematic considering the practical assembly of wire harnesses in a vehicle, especially in cramped installation areas.It is also not feasible considering an increasing number of wire harnesses assembled in future products like electric cars.Thus, clamp detection methods without installing additional parts on clamps are desired.

(p17.3) As for connector, recognition was mainly used to provide geometric information to the control system so that the robot could flexibly perceive and manipulate the connectors [38,10,16,39,40,17,19].Previous research mainly adapted 2D image recognition to acquire the positions or orientations of connectors [38,10,16,39,40,19].Tamada et al. [39], using a 2D camera, assumed that all connectors were placed on a flat workbench to reduce the degrees of freedom.However, considering the actual manufacturing scenario, wire harnesses are not fixed on a flat workbench before or during assembly, making the connectors distribute randomly in a 3D space.Thus, the degrees of freedom of connectors cannot be reduced directly.Although an RGB-D camera was adopted, Yumbla et al. [17] acquired the positions of connectors based on 2D image processing and integrated depth information captured by the RGB-D camera to further obtain the 3D measurement of connectors instead of processing depth or other 3D information independently or together with 2D color information.Zhou et al. [19] proposed a shape-based 3D matching method, where CAD models of connectors were registered to the detection results based on 2D connector detection to obtain the 3D information of detected connectors.Considering the increasingly advancing and affordable photography technology and recent development of algorithms in the computer vision community, it is promising to implement depth or other 3D cameras to acquire spatial information and process 3D information directly, which indicates detection and pose estimation of connectors based on 3D information a direction of future research.

(p17.4) Besides, studies on recognition of the wire part [20,18,21] have explored more advanced RGB-D camera or 3D scanner and learning-based algorithms and have demonstrated the performance of 3D vision applications on facilitating a better perception of the structure of wire harnesses, which, on the one hand, creates a possibility for robotized preparation, transport, disentangling, and routing of wire harnesses in the future assembly station, on the other hand, provides references to address computer vision applications on the other components of wire harnesses based on 3D data.
## (s18) Practicality and reliability of vision systems
(p18.0) Although the analyzed articles [13,11,12,30,38,10,16,39,40,17,19,20,18,21] have demonstrated various solutions for achieving different tasks of robotized wire harness assembly under laboratory settings, the practicality and reliability of the state-of-the-art vision system in practical applications remain obscure.Table 7 and Table 8 present the qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted on vision systems in different studies.Yet, few studies considered the issues of practicality and reliability, such as repeatability of the proposal [19] and time cost on the vision system [18].

(p18.1) In a practical manufacturing environment, it is inevitable for the vision system to cope with inconsistent conditions, such as background [13] and illumination [12].Koo et al. [13] revealed the complex background as a non-negligible hindrance for a totally vision-based wire shape estimation in an actual plant.Jiang et al. [12] indicated the lack of vision and laser processing robustness as one of the significant reasons behind experiment failures, for example, the variation of illumination conditions.

(p18.2) From the business perspective, there is also a demand for the processing time of robotized assembly to fulfill the productivity in practical production, which requires the vision system to perceive the state of the object to be manipulated fast enough to allow for a following robot action [64].Jiang et al. [11] demonstrated the technical feasibility of robotized wire harness assembly, but the average speed and reliability were still far from the requirement of practical application.Guo et al. [18] also identified the necessity of promoting time efficiency.Therefore, evaluating the vision system from the perspective of processing time is desired and necessary, which, however, was involved little in previous research [18].

(p18.3) Thus, it is critical to evaluate the practicality and reliability of vision systems regarding different perspectives, such as recognition accuracy, processing speed, and physical facilities in the assembly station, under actual production configurations with various background and illumination conditions.It is also critical for practical application to consider the pay-off of implementing vision systems to automate the wire harness assembly, which affects sustainability from the economic perspective [3,65,60].

(p18.4) Another practical issue that has not been discussed in previous studies [13,11,12,30,38,10,16,39,40,17,19,20,18,21] is the fact that some wire harnesses are installed onto the vehicle frames on a moving production line [14], for which Shi et al. [14] proposed a method for guiding a mobile robot manipulator to assemble wire harnesses onto a moving vehicle with visual servoing.Nevertheless, the processing time and feature engineering are still challenging [14].
