## (s1) Distal Coronary Microembolization
(p1.0) Distal coronary microemboli and microinfarction has been identified at autopsy in patients with acute coronary syndromes who died of sudden cardiac death [35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42].Okamura et al used an intracoronary Doppler guide wire to visualize and count microemboli during PCI in patients.The investigators found that the size of microemboli ranges between 47.16 to 2503.48 µm [43].Other investigators found that the size of microemboli in patients after sudden cardiac death due to coronary intervention averaged 250 µm [44].It was also found that size and volume of microemboli has a different impact on myocardial perfusion [45].
## (s5) Consequences of Microembolization
(p5.0) Experimental studies have shown greater LV dysfunction in the microembolized territory than would be expected from the final extent of microinfarction [33,56].The most likely explanation for the severe contractile dysfunction is rather the inflammatory reaction to microembolization and microinfarction.Heusch and co-workers have shown that the reasons for the contractile dysfunction are the release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α [83] and a myofibrillar oxidation [84].Accordingly, investigators used non-specific anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid methylprednisolone [51], specific TNF-α antibodies [33], and the non-specific anti-oxidants ascorbic acid [84] for preventing the deleterious effects of coronary microembolization on LV dysfunction.These therapies showed some beneficial effects.Another study showed that TNF-α has an active role in protecting the myocardium from the formation of microinfarction after microembolization [83] and blocking TNF-α cause an increase in the extent of microinfarction [85].Microinfarction, caused by the large volume of dislodged microemboli, can be detected at 24 hours by the release of biochemical markers of myocardial injury; such as creatine kinase and troponin [17,86].
## (s6) Cardiac Protection
(p6.0) Catheter-based coronary intervention has been introduced as an alternative to conventional surgery for patients with high risk due to comorbidities and age.Catheter-based coronary intervention is performed while the heart is beating and coronary flow is not interrupted.Coronary plaques and debris are disrupted during the passage of the guide wire, positioning of the balloon and stent implantations.When oversized stent or higher pressures are used, strain on the plaque would increase, resulting in microemboli being sloughed into the lumen of the artery through stent struts, thereby increasing the risk for distal microinfarction.Based on the histological analysis of retrieved debris, the Enhanced Myocardial Efficacy and Recovery by Aspiration of Liberated Debris (EMERALD) trial, showed visible debris in 78% of patients [107].Thus, the use of distal protection devices in capturing emboli seems to be very attractive.
