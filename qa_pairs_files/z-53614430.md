## (s2) Engineering of plastid genome for production of biopharmaceuticals
(p2.0) One of the most fascinating applications of plastid genetic engineering is being used for the production of biopharmaceuticals. Plant cell expressing therapeutic proteins can be lyophilized and stored indefinitely at room temperature without losing their efficacy (Kwon et al. 2013). So, the use of high level expression of particular protein in edible leaves permits oral delivery and hence reduces production cost by eliminating the purification step. Plastid transformation has made enormous advances in the field of molecular farming for the production of high end biopharmaceuticals. More than 40 biopharmaceuticals and vaccine antigens have been expressed in the chloroplast genome by different researchers .
