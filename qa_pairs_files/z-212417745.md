## (s8) Goal and Scope
(p8.0) Definition of goal and scope is the first step of an LCA study, as it defines the purpose or application of the study, as well as the scope of assessment to be conducted. As per our analysis of the selected studies, energy and carbon are the most considered environmental indicators, so some LCA studies merely investigate the life cycle primary energy and carbon of the wave and tidal energy systems [11][12][13][14]18,19,23]. In this case, these studies are merely LCI studies, as shown in Table 1, since no life cycle impacts are assessed and discussed.
## (s21) Allocation of Inputs and Outputs
(p21.0) An allocation procedure is suggested by ISO since most industrial processes yield multiple, rather than single, outputs and are based on complicated material and energy inputs. As shown in Figure 2, the allocation procedures for reuse and recycling are described by the selected LCA studies except for two [22,23]. Allocation procedures for inputs were considered by few studies [12,17,25].
