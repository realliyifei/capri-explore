## (s2) Literature Review
(p2.0) We used the following key terms in our search: "facial nerve tumours," "paediatric facial schwannoma," "paediatric facial nerve paralysis," and "paediatric facial nerve tumours."The databases examined included PubMed, Medline, and ScienceDirect.We only included manuscripts written in English.Cases of neurofibromatosis and intra-and extratemporal lesions not involving the FN were excluded.Facial nerve tumors studies where adult and pediatric groups could not be differentiated were also excluded.2][13] We selected 20 papers published between 1965 and 2019, of which 13 were case reports, 6 were retrospective studies of case series, and 1 was an overview of pediatric peripheral FN palsy.In these 20 papers, we identified 26 patients aged less than 18 years old who were affected by FNTs.We used the House-Brackmann (HB) facial nerve grading system to evaluate the degree of FN palsy.This system has 6 grades, spanning from grade I (normal function) to grade VI (total paralysis).We reviewed information on symptoms, FN status, types of treatment, and clinical outcomes.We could not perform a meta-analysis due to the small number of articles and patients.
## (s5) Epidemiology
(p5.0) The mean age of children diagnosed with an FNT was 7.3 years (2 months to 16 years).There were 11 females and 11 males.The gender and age of the remaining 4 children were not reported by Grinblat et al. 14 Twenty-two (84.6%) children had schwannomas (5 of them had a schwannoma in the parotid gland, 19.2%), 2 (7.7%) had meningiomas, 1 (3.8%) had epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and 1 (3.8%) had a germ cell tumor (Table 1).
## (s6) Clinical Presentation
(p6.0) Facial nerve palsy was the most common clinical presentation of an FNT in children (18/26, 69.2%).Six children (23.1%) had complete FN paralysis (HB grade VI), 4 (15.4%) had HB grade III facial palsy, 3 (11.5%)had HB grade V facial palsy, and 2 (7.7%) had HB grade IV facial palsy.Eight children (30.8%) had normal FN function.The FN function was not reported for 3 (11.5%)children.The age of palsy onset was reported for 16 children, averaging 5.1 years.In 2 patients reported by Kim et al 15 and Cushing et al, 16 studying old photographs and videos helped establish the true age at palsy onset, which was earlier than reported by parents.6][17][18][19] Some degree of hearing loss was the second most common symptom (8/26, 30.8%) as assessed by audiometric tests.Three children (11.5%) had vestibular problems like dizziness, unsteady gait, or vomiting.One child (3.8%) had tinnitus, 1 had a tender mass in the external auditory canal (EAC), 1 had a middle ear cholesteatoma, and 1 had recurrent otitis media.One child with a germ cell tumor had bilateral sixth nerve palsy in addition to FN palsy.1][22][23][24] Their FN function was normal.The symptoms above were not mutually exclusive and could co-occur.
## (s7) Imaging
(p7.0) Most children underwent a combination of MRI and CT examinations (16/26, 61.5%).Four children (15.4%) underwent a CT examination only.Two children (7.7%) with parotid masses underwent MRI and ultrasound examinations.One child (3.8%) with a parotid mass had an ultrasound examination only.Computed tomography of some intratemporal FNTs revealed enlarged fallopian canal with some bone erosion (Table 2). 15,25,26Magnetic resonance imaging usually revealed enlarged FN, with intratemporal schwannomas enhancing with contrast and appearing hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyper-or isointense on T2-weighted images. 25Ultrasound revealed well-circumscribed homogenous intraparotid masses with hypoand isoechoic patterns. 21,23One meningioma enhanced with contrast and appeared isointense on T1-weighted MRI scans. 27However, due to its limited spread to the CPA, it could not be distinguished from a schwannoma by a dural tail.The FN was asymmetrically enlarged on CT, but there was no characteristic petrous bone hyperostosis.Moskowitz et al 28 reported an epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with irregular edges and adjacent bone erosion on CT.The largest proportion of FNTs (11/26, 42.3%) involved the GG, either alone or with adjacent regions.Two FNTs (7.7%) were limited to the IAC.Five schwannomas (19.2%) were found on the extratemporal parotid branches of the FN.Thirteen FNTs (50.0%), including 4 schwannomas reported by Grinblat et al 14 involved multiple segments.
## (s8) Treatment
(p8.0) Surgery was the most applied therapeutic approach (24/26, 92.3%).In 23 patients (88.5%),FNTs were resected completely, and partially in 1 patient (3.8%) with debulking of the EAC portion. 26The retroauricular transmastoid approach extended with middle fossa craniotomy was the most common technique used in 10/23 (43.5%).Superficial parotidectomy was performed in all 5 intraparotid schwannomas (21.7%).A translabyrinthine approach was performed in 2 patients (8.7%).Other approaches were retrosigmoid, transotic, trans otic-trans parot id, transcervical, suboccipital, and subtotal petrosectomy.Depending on the segment of the FN resected, nerve continuity was restored via hypoglossal anastomosis or nerve graft.1][22][23] Watchful waiting approach with regular MRI with gadolinium and neurotologic examinations was applied in the FN schwannoma case reported by Cushing et al. 16 The treatment approach to the germ cell tumor in a 2-month-old child was not reported. 29
## (s9) Tissue Pathology
(p9.0) Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed preoperatively in 5 intraparotid schwannomas, 18,[20][21][22][23][24] providing a correct diagnosis only in one case reported by Coraglia et al. 22 Stromal characteristics of cells revealed by FNAC were suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma in 2 cases where a parotid mass was observed.Still, this diagnosis was changed to intraparotid schwannoma intra-operatively. 23,24ranscanal biopsy was performed in a child with a mass in the EAC  CHL, conductive hearing loss; Chole, cholesteatoma; CPA, cerebellopontine angle; EAC, external auditory canal; F, female; GG, geniculate ganglion; HB, House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system; HL, hearing loss; IAC, internal auditory canal; M, male; m, months; MFA, middle fossa approach; NA, not available; RSA, retrosigmoid approach; SC, suboccipital craniectomy; SNHL, sensorineural hearing loss; SP, superficial parotidectomy; STP, subtotal petrosectomy; TCA, transcervical approach; TLA, translabyrinthine approach; TMA, transmastoid approach; TM-SLA, transmastoid supralabyrinthine approach; TOA, transotic approach; TO-TPA, transotic-transparotid approach; VII-XII, nerve VII-XII anastomosis; y, years.

(p9.1) and revealed a schwannoma. 26Frozen-section biopsy was performed intra-operatively in at least 19 patients to determine tumor type and confirm the resection margin.Facial nerve schwannomas appeared as well-circumscribed encapsulated bundles of spindle cells with nuclear palisading and no mitosis.They stained positive for the S100 protein. 20,23,30Khilnani et al 24 reported brain tissue-like appearance of an intraparotid schwannoma.Two meningioma samples exhibited whorled patterns with psammoma bodies and some calcification. 19,27hey stained positive for the epithelial membrane antigen and negative for the S100 protein and CD34.Reticulin-stained epithelioid hemangioendothelioma contained many myofibroblasts and exhibited high vascularity. 28
## (s10) Outcomes
(p10.0) Hearing improved in 1 child (3.8%) and worsened in 6 children (23.1%).One child experienced mild transient impairment of the fifth and the sixth cranial nerves after surgery. 30No tumor recurrence was observed in children whose tumors were resected.

(p10.1) Case Report 1 A 12-year-old male was admitted to our department in August 2020 for evaluation of head trauma after an accidental bicycle accident.He suffered progressive hearing loss and tinnitus in the right ear, which had started a few months earlier, and right FN palsy, which had become obvious a year earlier.Clinical examination revealed HB grade III FN palsy.Audiometric assessment revealed moderate sensorineural hearing loss above medium frequencies on the right side (Figure 1).Eye examination was normal.Genetic testing excluded neurofibromatosis type 2. Computed tomography scan revealed an enlarged right IAC and a mass involving the GG and the tympanic   segment of the FN (Figures 2 and 3).T1-weighted MRI showed enhancement of the right side mass (Figure 3).The initial diagnosis based on clinical and radiological findings was FN schwannoma.In October 2020, the patient underwent surgical treatment.The tumor covering a wide area of the tympanic segment, GG, intralabyrinthine segment, and the IAC was completely removed using a modified transcochlear approach type A. A wide portion of the FN affected by the tumor was sacrificed.Histologic evaluation of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of FN schwannoma.The patient was discharged 1 week after surgery.Postoperative FN function was HB grade VI.Six months later, the patient underwent FN anastomosis between the FN nerve and the masseteric nerve.Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed complete tumor removal.
## (s14) Treatment
(p14.0) Facial nerve tumor treatment options include radiological observation, bone decompression, tumor debulking, complete tumor resection, and radiotherapy.The choice of treatment depends on the size and type of the tumor, the duration and degree of facial palsy, the hearing status, and patient's consent.

(p14.1) Complete tumor resection was the most common treatment (88.5%), but the timing of intervention was controversial.Generally, FN function after resection was not better than HB grade III, with the notable exceptions reported by Grinblat et al 14 and Yafit et al. 31 Therefore, the consensus is to monitor tumor growth radiologically if the FN function is normal or below HB grade III and to resect the tumor if the FN function is HB grade III or above. 32Liu and Fagan 32 also argued that tumor resection is indicated when it compresses the CPA.Some authors promote earlier intervention because, firstly, children have better regeneration capacity and, secondly, muscle deterioration and nerve fiber infiltration are not advanced yet. 15,29,31This is thought to lead to easier surgery and a better outcome. 31sidual/intact hearing should be preserved whenever possible.According to Van Den Abbeele et al, 25 surgery should be delayed for some children until hearing preservation methods can be used.When hearing is lost, translabyrinthine and transotic approaches can be used. 18Grinblat et al 14 argued that complete resection of an extensive tumor is more important than hearing and FN preservation.Kim et al 15 also emphasized that the FN should be entirely exposed during surgery, and the resection margin must be confirmed by frozen-section biopsy.
## (s15) Outcomes
(p15.0) Facial nerve function improved or remained the same in 16/26 (61.5%) of the reviewed cases.The best functional outcomes were achieved with intraparotid schwannomas, which were easier to strip free of the nerve without damaging it. 20All children with an intraparotid schwannoma maintained normal FN function after surgery except one, although the follow-up period in his/her case was only 3 months, and he/she might have recovered later. 24Outcomes are mainly affected by the age of palsy onset, the duration of palsy before surgery, and the degree of FN function, although Van Den Abbeele et al 25 did not find such relationships in their case studies. 1,5,32,40There is less risk of immediate and complete facial paralysis with conservative treatment, whereas radical tumor resection almost inevitably results in HB grade III palsy. 32Grafting type does not seem to affect the outcome. 15Prognosis is usually better in children than in adults, although Ozkale et al noticed poorer outcomes in younger children than in older children. 29,43se Reports We also reported 2 recent observations that were initially classified as FNTs.In the first patient, the diagnosis of FN schwannoma was confirmed.The tumor and the associated segment of the FN were removed, resulting in postoperative HB grade VI palsy.In the second patient, the diagnosis was changed intra-operatively to FN edema.The affected segment of the FN was decompressed, resulting in postoperative HB grade V palsy.
