## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) A wound is an injury to living tissue by a cut, blow or other impacts, which typically causes the disruption of the normal structure and function of the skin and its architecture [1]. The fundamental response to the injury is wound healing which results in restoration of tissue integrity. Wound healing is a process that consists of four overlapping and continuous phases which are independent of each other. The four phases are coagulation, inflammation, granulation tissue formation and scar tissue formation [1,2]. For optimal wound healing, the said phases must occur in the proper sequence for a specific duration of time in an optimal condition. At present, wound management includes medical care such as antibiotic and wound debridement (enzymatic, biologic, surgical and irrigation), topical therapy (growth factors, antiseptic and antimicrobials agents) and wound dressings (film, hydrogel, foam, alginate, hydrocolloids) has been utilised [3]. These measures are meant to improve the wound healing environment and prevent infections [3]. However, there is lacking data to support and justify any of these measures. As such, the need to discover compounds that improve wound healing through intrinsic factors such as oxidative stress and inflammation is crucial.

(p0.1) Unfortunately, drug discovery is a time-consuming and expensive process that involves the identification of new chemical entities (NCEs). NCEs can be discovered through either chemical synthesis (an approach that was found to be less effective in terms of the overall success rate) [4] or by isolating natural compounds. Wound healing activity of plant extracts can be attributed to the antimicrobial, anti-oxidative or free radical scavenging properties and anti-inflammatory activity of the phytoconstituents, as well as mitogenic activity, angiogenesis, collagen production and DNA synthesis, which are induced by their phytoconstituents [5].
## (s9) DISCUSSION
(p9.0) There are many factors which may affect wound healing through one or more phases of the wound healing process, thus causing improper or impaired wound healing. Such wounds frequently enter a state of pathologic inflammation due to an uncoordinated wound healing process. These factors can be categorised into local and systemic factors. Local factors include oxygenation, infection, foreign body, and venous insufficiency directly influence the characteristics of the wound. On the other hand, systemic factors are those factors that associated overall health or disease state of the individual that affect the ability of the wound to heal, such as age, gender, stress, ischaemia, diseases, obesity, the use of medication, alcoholism, smoking, nutrition, and immunocompromised conditions [18]. Plants have immense potential when it comes to the management and treatment of wounds. In the past, many plants were known to be used by tribal and traditional medicine practitioners for the treatment of wounds. The natural agents induce wound healing through mechanisms such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. As phytomedicine is not only affordable but also safe, it has been a great interest to scientists to discover new effective drugs [19].

(p9.1) T. cordifolia (Menispermaceae) or more commonly known as "Guduchi" in Sanskrit is a large, perennial, deciduous climbing shrub of weak and fleshy steam with greenish-yellow typical flowers that are commonly found at higher altitudes [5,20]. In Ayurveda, T. cordifolia is known for its immense application in the treatment of many diseases. Today, it is clinically used by many patients as it is available as either a single herbal drug or in formulations [21]. Traditionally, the leaves and stems of T. cordifolia are used to treat rheumatism, fever, jaundice, cough, eye disease and diabetes [22][23][24][25], whereas the root is used to treat vomiting [22]. It is also known to be used to treat skin diseases and to be an anti-poison and antibacterial [25]. Scientifically, T. cordifolia has been demonstrated to have anti-cancer activity [26][27][28], the ability to enhance cognition and memory, anti-inflammatory and wound healing activity [10,14,29], anti-malaria activity [30] and antifungal [31].

(p9.2) Over recent years, the wound healing ability of T. cordifolia has been explored. Studies have been demonstrated the potential wound healing ability of T. cordifolia on different wound models with different formulations and dosages, either in topical (1% to 10%) or oral (200 mg/kg to 600 mg/kg) route of administration. The dosage used was within the safe dose range. Acute toxicity tests conducted in different studies shown that no toxicity nor death was noted at doses above 3 g/kg of ethanolic and aqueous extracts [32][33][34] and 5 g/kg of methanolic T. cordifolia extract [8]. Additionally, up to 200 mg/kg of chloroformic extract of T. cordifolia did not show visible signs of toxicity in short term treatment [34]. Long term treatment (60 d) of 400 mg/kg T. cordifolia aqueous extract shown no effect on red blood cell count, white blood cell count, haemoglobin levels and haemotocrit levels [33]. A clinical study reported that when T. cordifolia was administered at a dose of 500 mg/day for 21 d in healthy individuals, it did not exert any remarkable adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, renal system and gastrointestinal system [20].

(p9.3) In term of wound healing model, wound healing activities of T. cordifolia was demonstrated to be potent in normal wounds and it was not as potent in diabetic wounds [15]. It was found to hasten wound healing via early reepithelisation, increased tensile strength, increased granulation tissue and collagen content in normal wound models [8,[11][12][13][14]. In the diabetic wound model, the epidermis layer was not properly formed for a 28-day old diabetic wound with few fibrous and collagen tissues [15]. This shown that, though oral T. cordifolia may not be an effective treatment on its own for diabetic wounds, however, when used together with topical insulin, it may synergistically help to improve diabetic wound healing [15].
