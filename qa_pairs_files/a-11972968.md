## (s1) Factors which influence the composting process
(p1.0) Breakdown of material composition in composting occurs as a natural process. But, the length of time and modalities for natural composting will require a long and heterogeneous process, making it unsuitable for industrial use. According to Ahn et al., (2008) enumerated more than 20 factors affect the decomposition of organic matter in the composting process. As a result of this, the composting process is very intricate, so it's not easy to estimate the effect of a single factor on the rate of organic decomposition. However, several factors were generally recognized as primary factors affecting the composting process. These factors contribute to an optimum environment for the microbial process in composting, which can be made into functions of technology as follows:

## (s2) Nutrient content
(p2.0) Material composition in term of nutrient content is an important strategy in controlling the composting process. The degradability of organic material in composting depends on the chemical composition of its organic matter fraction, as well as on the concentration of the C/N fraction. Normally, organic wastes differ from each other as regards their content of nitrogen. For example for manure (1.2-6.3 g N/100 g dry matter), food wastes (3.2 g N/100 g DM), grass clippings (2-6 g N/100 g DM), and wastewater sludge (2-7 g N/100 g DM) usually have high nitrogen contents, meanwhile cellulose materials such as sawdust (0.1 g N/100 g DM), straw (0.3-1 g N/100 g DM), and leaves (0.5-1 g N/100 g DM) are quite low in nitrogen (de Guardia et al., 2008).

## (s4) Oxygen concentration
(p4.0) Composting is an aerobic process, so an adequate supply of oxygen is a major consideration in controlling the composting process. Good control of oxygen concentration contributes to the results of the composting process, by affecting the, quality of end-product, energy consumption, and hygienization of compost. Oxygen concentration proved in the process has an interesting relationship to the rate of biodegradation. The oxygen concentration relates to (1) the main microbial groups during composting; (2) the balance of material; (3) the gas present in the internal atmosphere (O 2 , NH 3 , CO 2 , H 2 S); (4) phytotoxicity; and (5) pathogenic and indicator micro-organisms (de Bertoldi et al., 1988).

LLM judge: YES

## (s5) Structure
(p5.0) Rapid composting is dependent on condition and structure of the starting material. Size reduction in composting is necessary to increase the surface area of the material. The smaller the particle, the greater the ratio of the surface area to mass (de Bertoldi et al., 1983). This explained that the smaller particle size makes a better of biological degradation. The preparation of organic fractions for composting, of which there are two, mechanical or biological-mechanical, is an important start to the composting process. .After this process, the biodegradable organic fraction has been drastically conditioned and disintegrated, making it more easily separated by mechanical means from the inert material (de Bertoldi et al., 1983).

LLM judge: YES

## (s6) Microbial community
(p6.0) Composting is a self-heating process, an aerobic solid phase biodegradative process of organic waste material. In this composting process, microbial involved several interrelated factors, i.e metabolic heat generation, ventilation (oxygen output), temperature, moisture content, and available nutrient (de Bertoldi et al., 1983).

(p6.1) Generally, composting proceeds through three phase: 1) mesophilic (moderate temperature phase), 2) thermophilic (high temperature phase) and 3) cooling and maturation phase. During initial decomposition, a mesophilic microorganism is rapidly broken down by the soluble, into degradable compounds. Heat will produce and causes the compost temperature to rapidly rise, into the thermophilic phase. Recently, large varieties of mesophilic, thermotolerant, and thermophilic aerobic microorganisms, including bacteria, actinomycetes, yeasts and various other fungi have been extensively reported in composts (Faure and Deschamps, 1990, Chen et al., 2006, Déportes, 1998, Hassen et al., 2001, Suárez-Estrella et al., 2007.

LLM judge: YES

## (s7) Temperature
(p7.0) Compost temperature is an important factor due to its influence on the activity of microorganisms such as microbial metabolic rate and population structure. Composting begins at the ambient temperatures and with a microbial community resident in the original organic material. High microbial activities will leads to a rapid increase in temperature and a period of elevated temperatures. During this thermophilic stage, many of the non-thermo tolerant organisms are activated, including several pathogens. This will be followed by a gradually decrease in microbial activity, and a cooling and maturation of the composting mass (Steger et al., 2007).

## (s9) Pathogen control and inactivation
(p9.0) Salmonella spp. and E. coli are well known as pathogen indicators, in standard quality of composting. The role of both Salmonella sp. and E. coli in defining the ecological quality composts products was establish in the European Commission Decisions. The limits for their densities (<10 3 MPN g -1 and Absence in 50 g, respectively) is fixed in order to assign a seal quality in Commission Decision 2001/688/EC;Commission Decision 2005/384/EC (Briancesco, 2008). Meanwhile, the UK composting standard (BSI, 2005) requires composts that are sold to be free of Salmonella spp. and to contain fewer than 1000 colony forming units of E. coli per gram of material. Summarized by Böhm et al., (2007) the selected species to be an indicator organisms should fulfil several requirement: a. present with high probability in the raw material involved b. the transmission via products must be a factor in epidemiology c. if a biotechnology process is used the indicator should not be involved in the process itself d. the indicator should not be an organisms that is generally present in soil and soil-related material e. the method for isolation and identification must be simple definitive and reliable if applied to a substrate with a complex microbiological matrix such as compost sludge or related materials.

(p9.1) Among the bacterial indicators of faecal pollution, the role of E. coli must be considered because this bacterium has a good correlation with the presences of other enteric bacteria with the same characteristics. The Enterococci which belongs to the same group as E. coli, is known to have a higher resistance to physico-chemical treatments and has a close connection to the final gut tract of warm-blooded animals, which could be valid faecal indicator group. The detection of Salmonella spp, is very useful in stabilization of compost material. It is related to human pathogen and very important in order to evaluate the sanitary quality of stable compost to limit the health risk (Briancesco, 2008).

(p9.2) Sunar, N. M.,  The destruction of pathogen during the composting period can be effected by a number of mechanisms such as exposure to heat, temperature/time exposure, competition for nutrients, microbial antagonism (including antibiotic production and direct parasitism), production of organic acids and ammonia (Pereira-Neto et al., 1986, Wilkinson, 2008. Wilkinson, (2008) described the function of temperature and the length of exposure as the most important in the inactivation of pathogen. Besides, the temperature is relatively easy to measure during composting.

(p9.3) Exposure to an average temperature during composting of about 55-60°C for at least 3 days is usually sufficient to kill the vast majority of enteric pathogen (Deportes et al., 1995). Table 3.1 below shows the destruction of the pathogens depends on the temperature reached and the duration of the oxidation process.

## (s10) Regrowth of pathogen in compost
(p10.0) The enteric pathogen is known to be able to grow after having diminished below the detectable limits and representing a health hazard for certain uses of compost. Regrowth of pathogens in compost depends upon a number of factors such as moisture content bio-available nutrients, temperature and indigenous micro organisms (Sidhu et al., 2001). The most critical factor to prevent regrowth of pathogen is stability. The compost materials appear to be stable when it is too dry to support high rates of microbiology activity. Re-wetting of these compost material will lead an ideal environment being provided for pathogens to repopulate (Wilkinson, 2008).
