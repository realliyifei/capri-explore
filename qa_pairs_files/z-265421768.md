## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania.Female phlebotomine sandflies, of the genus Phlebotomus in the Old World and the genus Lutzomyia in the New World, transmit the parasite during blood feeding.There are 50 proven species of sandfly that can transmit disease to humans, while the estimated number of species capable of transmission is closer to 80 [1].Leishmaniasis is endemic in nearly 100 countries, with approximately 350 million people at risk of infection.The overall prevalence of leishmaniasis has been estimated to be 12 million cases, with 2 million new cases occurring annually; however, these incidence numbers are most likely underestimated due to no mandatory reporting.Importantly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized leishmaniasis as one of 20 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) [2], emphasizing the significant impact this disease has around the world and the lack of effective treatment options.
## (s4) Conclusions
(p4.0) With the plethora of research into identifying safe and efficacious anti-leishmanial compounds, several questions arise: (1) Is there a benefit to multi-target approaches active against several different organisms?(2) Would researchers' efforts be better spent focusing on compounds that are effective against multiple species of Leishmania? (3) Is single-target drug discovery the most beneficial to the need for chemotherapies at this time?(4) How can the large body of early discovery work be effectively translated to the clinic?

(p4.1) Traditional drug discovery has been described as "on-target", meaning compounds are designed to target a single molecular entity with high selectivity.This high selectivity ideally prevents unwanted effects due to compound interactions with other molecular targets.For anti-leishmanial research, this can be a difficult task due to the serious impediments and knowledge gaps within Leishmania biology itself.There are a limited number of fully validated targets and limited ways to confirm on-target effects of active compounds [176].In addition, Leishmania parasites exhibit a stochastic aneuploidy in their genomes; chromosome polyploidy has been cited in L. major chromosome 31 [177] and L. donovani chromosome 15 [178].Importantly, this malleability of the genome often hinders the basic reverse genetic approaches that researchers typically use for phenotyping and compound target identification.High selectivity has been a top priority in anti-leishmanial compound research, especially since the current chemotherapies available often have debilitating off-target effects.By only focusing on the molecular targets found in Leishmania, the potential for mammalian cross-activity greatly decreases.In addition, rodent models for both VL and CL have been used for decades in research settings but have poor translation to human disease; for example, the BALB/c murine model of CL produces measurable lesions but immunologically favors a Th2 response not necessarily mirrored in human disease.

(p4.2) Given the rapid development of drug resistance among pathogens and poor correlation between in vitro drug effects and in vivo efficacy with target-based approaches, research has turned to the potential for multi-target therapies.Importantly, since VL and CL predominantly affect socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, pharmaceutical companies are hesitant to develop and support drug discovery efforts due to the risk of not returning on the investment.By identifying compound classes potent against multiple organisms, larger pharmaceutical companies may be enticed to invest more resources.In addition, CL lesions often become hosts to opportunistic pathogens, like bacterial infections, and HIV-positive patients are more at risk of developing serious symptoms.By utilizing chemotherapies that could combat the parasite and other pathogens, overall costs can be decreased as well as increasing the likelihood of patients fully complying with treatment regimens.However, developing potential multi-target compounds rationally is challenging; target identification is already difficult, and small molecule discovery can be time and resource limiting.

(p4.3) While single-target compounds promise high selectivity, multi-target compounds can help lower the pharmaceutical investment limitation and be effective for comorbidities.There is no one-size-fits-all technique proven to identify the ideal chemical entity to selectively target Leishmania with no off-target effects.To truly combat CL incidence and morbidity, a combination of single-target and multi-target compounds need to be further developed and optimized.
