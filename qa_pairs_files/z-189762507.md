## (s14) E. Hardware Implementation
(p14.0) Unfolded learned algorithms are particularly attractive from a hardware implementation perspective, as they strongly resemble known algorithms for which efficient hardware architectures already exist. However, the hardware implementation complexity aspect is typically not considered in the literature, with some notable exceptions being [23], where highlevel hardware considerations for unfolded MS decoding are discussed, and [53], where FPGA and ASIC implementation results of the method in [40] are presented. As such, it remains largely unclear how the additional trainable parameters required by unfolded algorithms affect the hardware implementation complexity and the achieved throughput. Moreover, efficient hardware implementations of the training step are necessary for situations that require online learning.
