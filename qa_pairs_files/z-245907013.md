## (s1) COPD
(p1.0) The stereotype of a COPD patient has always been of an elderly man, as reflected in images such as the classic pink puffer/blue bloater [29,30]. The impact of this stereotype is evidenced by the widespread use of the Fletcher-Peto curve of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) decline, a curve derived entirely from studies of males [4].

(p1.1) The higher prevalence of COPD in males reflected a higher consumption of cigarettes among males in western countries during the early part of the 20th century, but has gradually changed as the disease has been more recognised and smoking habits have changed globally [31]. Smoking in females has grown in many high-income countries in particular and epidemiological estimates suggest COPD is now equally common in males and females in some regions [32]. The higher prevalence of COPD in females despite females smoking fewer cigarettes than males suggests that females may be more susceptible to the effects of cigarette smoke [33]. The contribution of non-cigarette risk factors to the global burden of COPD is large and growing [34][35][36]. The burden of indoor air pollutant exposure such as biomass fuel falls disproportionately on females and consequently some studies show that females account for up to two thirds of non-smoking COPD cases [34][35][36][37].
## (s3) Bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis (CF)
(p3.0) For reasons that are unknown, bronchiectasis not due to CF is a female predominant disorder in the majority of countries worldwide [111][112][113]. Data from the USA, Europe, Asia, Australasia and South America shows an excess of females ranging from modest (55 versus 45%) [114][115][116][117][118][119] to large (71 versus 29%) in the Australian bronchiectasis registry) [120]. This difference is evident across all ages and although bronchiectasis is caused by a wide range of different aetiologies [121], the female preponderance is evident across the majority. An important outlier in terms of sex differences is the India bronchiectasis registry, which reported that 57% of patients were male [122]. The dominant cause of bronchiectasis in India was tuberculosis, which is reported more frequently in males [123].
## (s6) Research considerations
(p6.0) Despite the increasing awareness and efforts, there remains significant sex and gender disparities in clinical studies leading to an incomplete understanding of disease [218]. In clinical trials, although we may see sex-stratified results, the efforts to consider gender and sex as it may relate to efficacy and safety of therapeutics remains limited. Inclusion of a gender dimension to these clinical studies will contribute to greater understanding of disease manifestations and outcomes in males and females [219]. Sex and gender aspects and their inter-relations need to be considered in all aspects of the research process. When sexand/or gender-specific differences are identified in pilot studies, clinical trials (therapies, devices etc.) should be sufficiently powered to evaluate these endpoints, be it related to safety or efficacy. Conscientious recruitment strategies at an early study or trial stage and in line with the study design can help to have equitable enrolment by sex and gender as well as assist with downstream late-phase trials. Given our movement towards personalised and precision-based medicine, sex and gender equity in studies will go a long way towards reaching this goal. Alongside investigators, similar efforts must be put in by academic institutions, pharmaceutical and bio-engineering companies, publishers, as well as policy makers such that we can innovate our current research paradigm and advance together.
