## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Domestication represents the evolutionary process in which the genetic, physiological, and behavioral (and cognitive) profile of a species is reshaped to adapt to a man-made environment. It arises from mutualism between two species, where the domesticator creates an environment and actively manages both the survival and reproduction of another species (the domesticated), which provides the former with resources and/or services [1].
## (s2) Sources of Selective Pressure: The Environment and Humans
(p2.0) Regardless of the initial process, domestication took place for about 15,000-30,000 years [18,19]. Dogs firstly associated with hunter-gatherers, then humans organized themselves into small settlements, and finally, into larger villages. The analysis of the domestication process, which produced marked differences between wolves and dogs, individuated three types of selective pressures (natural and sexual, human-mediated and improved selection), as depicted by Range and Marshall-Pescini in 2022 (Figure 1) [20].  [20]. The figure summarizes the wolf domestication process and the respective selective pressures that are likely to have been active during the process. Abbreviation: FRD, free-ranging dogs.

(p2.1) At the beginning, the natural and sexual selection shaped, and continues to shape, the cognitive and behavioral spheres of dogs. Many studies highlight genetic adaptations to specific environments [19,21] and preferences in the mating of wild dogs [22]. Then, humans "negatively" selected some specific characteristics (consciously or not). This selection allowed coexistence between dogs and humans for many thousands of years (for example, overly aggressive animals were killed). In the end, humans deliberately and directly "positively" selected specific phenotypic traits, a process that began with selecting dogs for different functions, became popular during the Victorian era, and nowadays, is reflected in the multitudes of dog breeds [20].

(p2.2) However, it should be noted that alongside the traits selected by man, the adaptation of dogs to a new ecological niche represents a fundamental part of the domestication process, since cognitive abilities are shaped by the social ecology of species, which differs greatly in the case of dogs and wolves [23].
## (s3) One Experimental Domestication Model: Belyaev's Foxes
(p3.0) In 1959, the Russian geneticist Dmitri Belyaev began a study to simulate the process of animal domestication. He aimed to create a selective regime that would reflect the conditions envisioned as "critical" for animal training and to understand the biological basis of the phenotypic changes produced by the domestication process, thus proposing that domestication was based essentially on "selection by tamability" [2]. The experiment was designed to record the effects of additionally intense selection for tameness and the correlated emergence of unexpected morphological and genetic traits [24]. To test this hypothesis, Belyaev used silver foxes, a melanistic variant of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), from a Canadian population of farmed foxes selected over more than 50 generations for increased docility [25]. Then, he systematically bred and tested hundreds of these individuals to verify their "friendliness" toward humans [2,26]. Over a span of 60 years, Belyaev and collaborators documented phenotypic changes in "their" foxes that closely resembled those produced by canine domestication [27] and discovered a drastic reduction in blood cortisol concentrations and less adrenal cortex reactivity in foxes selected for tameness compared to wild-type controls [2,28,29] (Figure 2).
## (s5) Wolves vs. Dogs: A Socio-Ecological Clash
(p5.0) Wolves are cursorial predators capable of hunting in groups (pack-hunting specialists) that base their diet mainly on ungulates. Their social organization involves a monogamous pair, accompanied by their offspring, composed of adults, subadults and puppies (nuclear family organization), and sometimes, unrelated individuals join the pack [20]. The size of the pack has a fundamental role in the success rates of hunting and in the defense of the territory, and very often clashes between schools result in lethal aggressions. Overall, it seems that wolves are heavily dependent on their social structure as a cohesive and functional pack, which allows them to get enough food, breed their cubs, and defend the territory [23]. As for dogs, free-ranging dogs show a feeding ecology closely related to the occupied niche in the human environment. Their diet consists mainly of human food waste, and in many populations, hunting (including pack hunting) plays a minor role. They have been considered "optionally social", since the size of the group depends on the abundance of food. In contrast to wolves, they have a much more flexible pack structure, as members of one pack often join another. Regarding the care of the offspring, dogs differ much from wolves. The cubs of free-ranging dogs are bred mainly by mothers [20], while among wolves, the occurrence of cooperative breeding of cubs by the pack with alloparental care is now well known [70].
## (s8) A Focus on the Ancient mtDNA Phylogeny in Three Mediterranean Peninsulas
(p8.0) Most recent studies focused on the female counterpart of mtDNA to inspect the evolutionary processes that affected the maternal lineages, and dogs were conventionally grouped into four main mtDNA haplogroups (Hgs): A, B, C, and D.

(p8.1) Europe is one of the most investigated regions concerning ancient dogs, since it was observed that old Europe (from the Pleistocene to the Holocene) presents four regions of dog populations: Northern Europe, presenting both the A and C haplogroups [90,92]; Central/Western Europe, with high frequencies of the Hgs C and D [88,[90][91][92]109,113]; Eastern Europe, characterized by the presence of HgD, as the main clade (over 90%), together with A and C [90,92,109]; and Southern Europe, showing the detection of the A, B, and C lineages [90,92,114], with the first record for high frequencies of HgA in pre-Neolithic Europe [115].

(p8.2) In 2016, Frantz and colleagues pointed out that ancient European dogs belonged to HgC or HgD, with HgC being the most frequently observed in Europe before the Neolithic period (more than 8000 years ago); however, most modern European dogs belong to HgA and HgB [92]. The first mtDNA lineage present in Europe before the Neolithic seems to be HgC, while HgA and HgD are believed to have arrived in Europe during Neolithic and post-Neolithic migrations together with humans [90]. It appears that crossbreeding between the dog and the wolf did not contribute significantly to the gene pool of mitochondrial DNA in the domestic dog [116].
