## (s2) Geometric side
(p2.0) The geometric properties of model sets Λ = Λ(W ) have been described in detail elsewhere (for instance [27,35]). We will restrict ourselves to pointing out a few of the most important features here. In the first place, model sets are Delone sets and have the property of finite local complexity. In fact they satisfy a very strong form of finite local complexity:

## (s8) Theorem 3 (Weyl) [39] If Λ is regular and f * is continuous then
(p8.0) Since W has boundary of measure zero, it is not necessary to insist that f * (which is supported on W ) be continuous on all of internal space, only on the window W .

(p8.1) In this way discrete averaging on the model set is transformed into integration on the window. This process was used in [4] to determine the existence of invariant measures on internal space in the presence of self-similarity on the quasi-crystal. We briefly explain this. We assume here that internal space is R n for some n.

## (s9) Dynamical systems side
(p9.0) So far we have looked at one model set in isolation. Now we move on to consider families of model sets. We start with a number of definitions and results. All of these may be found in the paper of M. Schlottmann [36] on which we have relied heavily here. Many are well-known in the context of tilings for which a recent reference with a good bibliography is [38]. In this section all point sets under discussion are assumed to be Delone sets in R d .

(p9.1) Two Delone sets S, S ′ in R d are locally isomorphic (or some people say locally indistinguishable) if, up to translations, every patch of either of them occurs in the other. Thus on any finite scale, up to translation, the two sets are indistinguishable. Given a Delone set S ⊂ R d we can look at its local isomorphism class (LI class) LI(S), namely all point sets locally isomorphic to it.

(p9.2) We denote by X (r) the set of all Delone sets of R d for which the minimum separation between distinct points is at least r. We assume in the rest of this section that r > 0 has been fixed.

(p9.3) We define a Hausdorff topology on X (r) as follows: two sets S, S ′ ∈ X (r) are "close" if for some large compact set K ⊂ R d and some small ǫ we have

(p9.4) for some v ∈ R r with |v| < ǫ. More precisely we define a uniformity U on X (r) using as the sets U(K, ǫ) of uniformity the set of pairs (S, S ′ ) satisfying (22).

## (s13) Comment
(p13.0) In this paper we have considered point sets in R d that are constructed through the method of projection from an embedding group and a lattice. We have assumed that the embedding group is of the form R d × G where G is a locally compact abelian group, which, in view of Theorem 1, is fairly natural. However, it is possible to study model sets in the situation where the 'physical space' has been replaced by an arbitrary locally compact abelian group without losing many of the most interesting properties. In particular the diffraction results of Theorem 12 have formulations in this generality [36].
