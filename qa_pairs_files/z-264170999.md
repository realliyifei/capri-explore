## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Placebo and nocebo effects are the effects of patients' positive and negative expectations, respectively, about their health status and they can occur during treatment with a placebo or an active agent, either in clinical practice or in clinical trials.][3][4][5] Over the past 30 years, there has been a surge of research on the placebo and nocebo effects in the fields of neuroscience, medicine, psychology and genetics.What has emerged is that there are many placebo and nocebo effects, not just one.They occur through specific mechanisms in many clinical conditions and in the domain of physical and cognitive performance. 6Furthermore, it has been shown that many biological mechanisms triggered by placebos and nocebos resemble those modulated by drugs, suggesting a possible interaction between psychological factors and drug action. 6n 2018, a consensus of experts emphasised the importance of distinguishing placebo effects from placebo responses. 7This need
## (s3) Review selection
(p3.0) The study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 16 with methods established prior to conducting the umbrella review.The protocol was registered on the international prospective register for systematic reviews PROSPERO (record no.CRD42023392281, see online supplemental appendix 1A).The objective was to capture systematic reviews, with or without metaanalyses, and narrative reviews aimed at mapping placebo and nocebo effects, or related effects, associated with pharmacological interventions.These studies were then to be informative in terms of biological mechanisms and/ or effect sizes.

(p3.1) The electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE/ PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched in September 2022, according to the search equation provided in online supplemental appendix 1B.The search was conducted applying the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study (PICOS) criteria reported in table 1, and no time restrictions were set.

(p3.2) Regarding the interventions, we excluded the investigation of placebo/nocebo effects and placebo-related/ nocebo-related effects in non-pharmacological interventions (eg, psychotherapy, acupuncture, surgery, neuromodulation, physical therapies, hypnosis, mindfulness training, biofeedback, neurofeedback, music) in order to circumscribe the area of investigation and reduce the degree of methodological variability among studies.

(p3.3) The randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and OLPs clinical trials included in the present umbrella review were required to have a three-arm design (ie, genuine treatment, placebo and no-treatment arms).The latter design allows participants receiving placebo treatment to be compared with those left untreated, and thus to disentangle placebo/nocebo effects from placebo/nocebo responses. 2o provide additional information on the biological mechanisms of placebo/nocebo effects, a first deviation from the original protocol was made for those metaanalyses based on rigorous placebo-controlled RCTs without a no-treatment group, which examined: (1) different routes of placebo administration and reported improvements not attributable to spontaneous remission or regression to the mean; (2) different likelihoods of receiving active treatment or placebo; (3) the type of adverse events (AEs) occurring in both the active and placebo arms.A second deviation was made for original research articles informative about mechanisms and effect sizes that: (1) addressed an underinvestigated topic in the field of placebo research that missed to be included in systematic or narrative reviews and (2) were too recent to be included in systematic or narrative reviews.
## (s6) Critical appraisal
(p6.0) EF and FP independently appraised the captured systematic reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool, which has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and construct validity. 17In assessing the overall quality of individual studies, more weight was given to the AMSTAR 2 critical domains (ie, 7 out 16 items). 17About the protocol domain, an explicit statement was required that the methods had been established prior to conducting the systematic review and/or that PRISMA guidelines 16 or those for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies 18 had been adhered to, and/or that any deviations from protocol had been reported.

(p6.1) In online supplemental appendix 2, the full assessment according to AMSTAR 2 tool was provided for each of the examined systematic reviews, including the seven critical domains marked in yellow and the final positive or negative rating.

(p6.2) Because of the real heterogeneity in the examined conditions and in studies design included in each systematic review, we did not use funnel plots and we choose to summarise the umbrella review results mainly through narrative synthesis and tables.

(p18.0) (with the year of study initiation as the only significant moderator), whereas the nocebo response substantially accounted for patients' reported AEs. 115espite the exponential growth of research into placebo and nocebo effects, these phenomena remain complex and far from being fully understood.First of all, meta-analyses rigorously quantifying the magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects are lacking for several of the clinical conditions examined: PD, anxiety, immune, endocrine and cardiovascular systems, gastrointestinal disorders, and oncology.Furthermore, while some studies provided answers to certain questions, they also raised new ones, thus identifying research gaps.For example, the magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects can be modulated through conditioning and instructional strategies?What kind of interaction exists between placebo and nocebo effects, that is, is it possible for placebos to act, in part or entirely, on a pre-existing nocebo effect under certain conditions?How do placebo and nocebo effects modulate subjective/patient-reported and objective (physiological/behavioural) outcomes in different clinical conditions?In addition, further investigations are needed both to study the factors predicting the magnitude of placebo and nocebo responses, for example, by screening for genetic polymorphisms among individuals, and to pursue the mapping of the conditions under which OLPs work, accompanied by the investigation of the underlying mechanisms.

(p18.1) Focusing instead on the therapist-patient encounter, the biggest challenges for future research include: (1) the identification of those elements, psychological and social, that may lead to a good relationship; (2) in-depth experiments with brain imaging techniques to understand complex functions such as hope, trust, empathy, compassion and admiration; (3) the development of questionnaires and psychometric measurements able to identify patient's needs.

(p18.2) This study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations.In fact, while the umbrella review methodology allows for a comprehensive summary of the findings, it does not permit to overcome the single study limitations, which include publication biases, and the lack of information about unpublished data and the grey literature.In addition, as the value of a second reviewer throughout the entire screening process of systematic reviews has been documented, 116 the use of a single reviewer in the database search represent a further potential limitation of this study.

(p18.3) In conclusion, this umbrella review was intended to raise awareness among clinicians and researchers of the application of clear evidence on the benefits and harms of placebo and nocebo effects.Depending on the contexts, specific tools were provided to best harness, develop, and implement strategies that enhance placebo effects and prevent or minimise potential nocebo effects associated with pharmacological interventions.In addition, this study identified which findings are ready to be implemented in clinical practice and highlighted research gaps that need to be addressed in the near future.
