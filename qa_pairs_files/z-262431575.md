## (s0) MATERIALS
(p0.0) Rice straw, wheat straw, corn straw and baggase are the major agrowastes which are most favorable feedstocks for bioethanol production due to their availability throughout the year.Table 1.gives the estimate worldwide production of these agrowastes.They also vary in chemical composition as given in Table 2.The utilization fraction of wheat straw, rice straw and corn straw is too low and varies with geographic region [10].Each year a large portion of agricultural residues is disposed of as waste.For instance, approximately 600 to 900 million tons per year rice straw is produced globally [11].The options for the disposal of rice straw are limited by the great bulk of material, slow degradation in the soil, harboring of rice stem diseases, and high mineral content.Only a small portion of globally produced rice straw is used as animal feed, the rest is removed from the field by burning, a common practice all over the world, increasing air pollution and affecting human health [12].

(p0.1) Globally, bioethanol production from the above mentioned agrowaste is now a matter of interest (Table 3).Rice straw is the most abundant waste compared to the other major wastes (Table 1) and rice straw can potentially produce 205 billion liters bioethanol per year, which is the highest among these four mentioned agricultural wastes.Lignocellulosics are processed for bioethanol production through three major operations: pretreatment for delignification is necessary to liberate cellulose and hemicellulose before hydrolysis; hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose to produce fermentable sugars including glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, mannose and fermentation of reducing sugars.The non-carbohydrate components of lignin also have value added applications [13].

## (s1) Pretreatment
(p1.0) Pretreatment methods refer to the solubilization and separation of one or more of these components of lignocellulosic biomass.The lignocellulosic complex is made up of a matrix of cellulose and lignin.This step is taken to make the solid biomass more accessible to chemical or biological treatment [14].By pretreating the complex, the matrix is broken to decrease the degree of crystallinity of the cellulose, and also, increase the fraction of amorphous cellulose, which makes it more susceptible for enzymatic attack [15].The lignocellulosic biomass is made susceptible by quick hydrolysis to increase yields of monomeric sugars [16].Pretreatment aimed at: (i) formation of sugars directly or subsequently by hydrolysis (ii) to avoid loss and/ or degradation of sugars formed (iii) to limit formation of inhibitory products (iv) to reduce energy demands and (v) to minimize costs.The three fundamental types of pretreatment are Physical, chemical and biological treatments.For an effective yield, all the three method are followed.

## (s4) Pyrolysis
(p4.0) In this process, the materials are treated at a temperature greater than 300 0 C. It leads to rapid decomposition of cellulose to produce gaseous products such as H 2 and CO and residual char.If lower temperature is used, the decomposition is slower and less volatile products are formed [15].The residual char is now further treated by leaching with water or with mild acid.The water leachate collected contains enough carbon source to support microbial growth for bioethanol production.The water leachate consist of mainly glucose.About 55% of total weight of the biomass is lost during water leaching [21].Mild acid leaching gives 80 to 85% conversion of cellulose to reducing sugars with more than 50% glucose.

## (s7) Acid pretreatment
(p7.0) Acid pretreatment method aims for high yields of sugars from lignocellulosics.It is usually carried out by concentrated or diluted acids (usually between 0.2% and 2.5% w/w) at temperatures between 130 0 C and 210 0 C to improve cellulose hydrolysis.Sulfuric acid is the most widely used acid [23].According to Moiser et al., [16], lignocellulose pretreated with dilute H 2 SO 4 give higher yield compared to other acids.A saccharification yield of 74% was obtained from wheat straw when subjected to 0.75% v/v of H 2 SO 4 at 121 0 C for 1 hour [24].The acid medium cleave the polysaccharides, especially hemicelluloses which are easier to hydrolyze than cellulose [23].However, during acid treatment, various microbial growth inhibitors like acetic acid, furfural and 5hydroxymethylfurfural are produced.As such hydrolysis products to be used for fermentation have to be detoxified.

## (s8) Alkaline pretreatment
(p8.0) Alkali treatment of lignocellulose disrupts the cell wall by dissolving hemicelluloses, lignin, and silica, by hydrolyzing uronic and acetic esters, and by swelling cellulose thereby digesting the lignin matrix.By this process, the substrates can be fractionated into alkali-soluble lignin, hemicelluloses and residue, which makes it easy to utilize them for more valuable products [16].Hydroxides of sodium, potassium, calcium and ammonium are used in this process.Low temperature and pressure are used in this method [16].Maximum release of 60% and 80% for lignin and hemicellulose respectively was found to be obtained by treating wheat straw with 1.5% NaOH for 144 h at 20 0 C (Sun et al.) [17].NaOH has been reported to increase hardwood digestibility from 14% to 55% by reducing lignin content from 24-55% to 20%.
