## (s1) Liver flukes
(p1.0) At least 15 species of liver flukes are known to cause human infections. They include C. sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini, O. felineus, Metorchis conjunctus, M. bilis, M. orientalis, Amphimerus sp., Amphimerus noverca, A. pseudofelineus, Pseudamphistomum truncatum, P. aethiopicum, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, D. hospes, Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica (Table 1)  . They can be divided into small liver flukes (C. sinensis, Opisthorchis spp., Metorchis spp., Amphimerus spp., Pseudamphistomum spp. and Dicrocoelium spp.) and large liver flukes (F. hepatica and F. gigantica) according to the size of the adult worms. The first intermediate host is freshwater or brackish water snails, and the second intermediate host is freshwater fish (C. sinensis, Opisthorchis spp., Metorchis spp., Amphimerus spp. and Pseudamphistomum spp.), ants (Dicrocoelium spp.) or aquatic vegetation (Fasciola spp.) ( Table 1). The morphological similarity of opisthorchiid eggs to heterophyid as well as lecithodendriid-like fluke eggs frequently poses diagnostic problems in human fecal examinations. Molecular techniques using internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) have been used to differentiate the eggs as well as larvae and adults of opisthorchiid and heterophyid flukes (Duflot et al., 2021).

## (s5) Metorchis spp.
(p5.0) Metorchis conjunctus (Cobbold, 1860) Looss, 1899 (the North American liver fluke) is a common parasite of carnivorous mammals, including sledge dogs (causing fatality), in northern Canada (MacLean et al., 1996). Asymptomatic sporadic human infections were reported in Canada since 1945, particularly in aboriginal populations from Quebec to Saskatchewan and the eastern coast of Greenland (Babbott et al., 1961;MacLean et al., 1996). In 1993, an outbreak of a common-source infection with this fluke, with acute clinical symptoms of fatigue, upper abdominal tenderness and pain, low-grade fever, headache, weight loss and anorexia, occurred among 19 Korean immigrants in a river north of Montreal, Canada; the patients consumed wild-caught fish (Catostomus commersoni) that had been undercooked (MacLean et al., 1996). Laboratory findings included high blood eosinophilia and raised liver enzymes (MacLean et al., 1996). However, serious liver diseases have not been reported in human infections.
## (s11) Paragonimus gondwanensis
(p11.0) Paragonimus gondwanensis Bayssade-Dufour et al., 2014 was described as a new species from humans (only eggs) and carnivorous mammals (adult worms) in Cameroon (Bayssade-Dufour et al., 2014). This species is morphologically distinct from all other Paragonimus species in having a very short excretory bladder, once used as a character for a different genus, Euparagonimus

## (s22) Stellantchasmus falcatus
(p22.0) Stellantchasmus falcatus Onji and Nishio, 1916 was first described from cats experimentally fed the mullet harbouring the metacercariae in Japan . Human infections were first reported in Japan and thereafter in many Asian-Pacific countries, including South Korea, the Philippines, Hawaii, Thailand and Vietnam (Chai et al., , 2012a.

(p26.0) Isthmiophora hortensis (Asada, 1926) Kostadinova and Gibson, 2002 (syn. Echinostoma hortense) was first found from rats in Japan, and then also from rats in South Korea and China . Human infections were first documented in Japan in 1976 and then also found in South Korea and China (Chai and Lee, 2002;Chai et al., 2009). In South Korea, clinical cases with significant abdominal symptoms were diagnosed by extracting living worms by gastroduodenal endoscopy . Loaches, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus and M. mizolepis, and other freshwater fish, including Odontobutis obscura interrupta and Moroco oxycephalus, are the second intermediate hosts .

(p26.1) Echinochasmus spp. Echinochasmus japonicus Tanabe, 1926 was originally reported in Japan from dogs, cats, rats, mice and birds experimentally fed the metacercariae encysted in freshwater fish . This fluke is now known to occur mainly in Far Eastern countries (Chai and Lee, 2002;Chai and Jung, 2019). In Japan, an experimental human infection was reported to be successful, and in China and South Korea natural human infections were discovered . Freshwater fish, including P. parva, Hypomesus olidus and Gnathopogon strigatus, are the second intermediate hosts Choi et al., 2006).
## (s29) Other intestinal fluke species
(p29.0) Brachylaima cribbi Brachylaima cribbi Butcher and Grove, 2001 was first described by Butcher and Grove (2001) in Australia. Human infections (about 15 cases) were reported in Australia (Butcher et al., 1998(Butcher et al., , 2003. Helicid land snails, such as, Cernuella virgata, serve as the source of human infection (Butcher and Grove, 2005). Clinical symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, low-grade fever and fatigue (Butcher et al., 2003).
