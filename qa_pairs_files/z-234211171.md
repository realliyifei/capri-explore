Statistical analysis

Comprehensive meta-analysis software was used for data analysis.The prevalence of UTI, antibiotic resistance, and bacterial agents was calculated by 95% confidence intervals.Due to the existence of heterogeneity among studies, a random effects model was used.I 2 and the Q-statistic tests were used for the assessment

(p6.1) f heterogeneity among studies included in the present review.P < 0.05 of Q-test and I 2 test >50% was considered statistically significant.

In this study, we evaluated the publication bias visually through the Funnel plot.If the distribution of articles is evenly placed inside the funnel, it indicates that there is no publication bias, and if they placed outside the funnel or there is a heterogeneous and unbalanced distribution inside the funnel, it indicates the presence of bias in the study publication.In addition to the Funnel plot, the statistical Egger's linear regression test was used to further investigate publication bias.According to this test, if the P < 0.05, it indicates the existence of publication bias; otherwise, if it is greater than this value, it indicates the abse

DISCUSSION

In total, UTI is considered as the most common infection and the most possible site of infection that leads to hospitalization of patients with kidney transplantation. [20]The prevalence of UTI in kidney transplant recipients is similar in both developed and developing countries. [5]The prevalence of posttransplant UTI in the kidney transplant recipients varies between 12% and 75%. [21]Of course, in developing countries, this rate may be higher due to epidemiological exposure and lower standards of hygiene. [22]A meta-analysis conducted in 2016 showed that the USA had a significantly higher prevalence of UTIs than European countries (41% vs. 33%). [9] the present systematic review and meta-analysis, the combined prevalence of UTI in renal transplant recipients was reported by 31.1%.The combined prevalence of Gram-negative bacteria was 69%.The most common pathogens among Gram negatives were E. coli followed by K. pneumoniae with frequency 43.4% and 13%, respectively.Furthermore, the least rate belonged to A. baumannii with prevalence of 3%.Furthermore, subgroup analysis for Gram-positive bacteria showed the combined prevalence of 31%.The highest predominant microorgani
