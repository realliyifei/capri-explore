## (s10) FeCrAl Alloys Are Resistant to Stress Corrosion Cracking from the Water and Fuel Side
(p10.0) It is difficult to address in detail all the attributes of the FeCrAl alloys for cladding applications ( Table 3). The outstanding mechanical properties of FeCrAl, such as APMT compared to Zircaloy-2, have been recently discussed elsewhere [32]. The fact that APMT is much stronger than Zirc-2 at temperatures near 350 °C would allow for the reduction of the wall thickness of the APMT to 0.3 mm from the 0.6 mm currently used for Zr alloys. This reduction in wall thickness will compensate for the higher thermal neutron absorption of the FeCrAl alloys compared to Zircaloy. APMT and other FeCrAl alloys have excellent mechanical properties and creep resistance at temperatures in the order of 800 °C, which is more than double the temperature of the normal operation of the cladding. APMT and the newer generation of C26M cladding tubing are fabricated using powder metallurgy, which results in small grain sizes and high yield strength [32]. APMT has small additions of other alloying elements, developing nanosized particles that further increase its strength [28]. FeCrAl alloys also have a higher resistance to creep than
