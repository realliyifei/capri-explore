## (s4) Oxycodone
(p4.0) Oxycodone, a narcotic pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain, is available as twice-a-day controlled-release tablets (OxyContin TM ) for the management of moderate to severe, chronic low back pain. 39 This formulation was thought to have much lower abuse potential than immediate-release oxycodone because of its slow-release properties addiction. 40 
## (s6) Hydromorphone
(p6.0) Hydromorphone is a potent semi-synthetic opioid which is commonly used in the hospital setting, mostly IV because its bioavailability orally, rectally, and intranasally is very low. Osmotic extended-release oral delivery system (OROS TM ) of hydromorphone (Exalgo, Mallinckrodt) was approved by FDA, in 2010, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain in patients who are opioid-tolerant and who need around-the-clock analgesia. 33 Following OROS oral administration, an osmotic material absorbs water from GI tract and the drug pushes out through a laser formed or punched orifice on tablet surface in a controlled manner (Figure 7). 44 OROS technology allows hydromorphone to be released at a constant rate over a period of 24 hours. OROS hydromorphone was successfully used once-daily in patients with chronic low back pain 45 and chronic, moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain. 46
