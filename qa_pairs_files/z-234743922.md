## (s3) Carotenoids in Fruits
(p3.0) Almost all fruits contain carotenoids. Some typical fruits that are rich in carotenoids are mentioned here, including goji berries (Lycium barbarum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and apricot (Prunus armeniaca). Goji berries are recognized as a healthy food for both medicine and diet, the orange-red color of goji fruits is mainly determined by carotenoids. The dry wild goji fruits contain about 6 mg/g of carotenoids, of which zeaxanthin dipalmitate accounts for about 70-80%, which endowed the powerful ability to scavenge oxygen free radicals and active oxygen [14]. Tomatoes are important commercial crops, and the content of carotenoids is an important indicator of their quality. Tomato fruits contain at least twelve kinds of carotenoids, of which lycopene accounts for 70-90% of the total carotenoids, and β-carotene accounts for 5-26%. Lycopene confers tomato fruits with a strong antioxidant capability and high nutritional value [15]. Apricot fruits are also rich in carotenoids, and seven types of carotenoids have been identified in apricots. The content of trans-β-carotene is approximately 61.2 mg/kg (dry weight, DW), accounting for 39-65% of total carotenoids; 9-cis-β-carotene accounting for 15%; 3-cis-β-carotene, pre-xanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin accounting for about 10%; lutein accounting for 4%; zeaxanthin accounting for about 3%. To sum up, β-carotene makes up the predominant proportion of total carotenoids in apricot fruits, which makes it one of the best sources of β-carotene [16].
## (s6) Chemical Structure and Classification of Flavonoids
(p6.0) Flavonoids are a category of phenols with a basic C15 phenyl-benzopyrone skeleton formed by a C6-C3-C6 structure, and most contain the 2-phenylchroman core [32]. The typical flavonoid compound is a flavone, which was first identified from stems and leaves of the Primula plant [33]. The 2-phenylchroman core is constituted by two aromatic rings (A and B) linked by a central three-carbon chain that may or may not form a third ring (C). According to the connection position of B-ring (C-2, C-3 or C-4), most classes of this secondary metabolite known as flavonoids (flavones, flavonols, flavonones, and flavanols), isoflavonoids (isoflavones, isofavonones, isoflavonols, isoflavans, rotenoids, coumestans, pterocarpans, and isoflavenes) and neoflavonoids (arylcoumarins, neoflavenes, etc.), respectively [34]. Moreover, flavonoids can be divided into flavonols, flavones, flavanols (catechins), flavanones, anthocyanins, and isoflavonoids based on variations and saturation of the C-ring [35]. There are some special cases, including aurones, chalcones, and dihydrochalcones etc. are the primary product of flavonoids biosynthesis, which are also precursors of other classes [34]. For example, chalcone is not considered a true flavonoid due to the lack of the aromatic C-ring but is still considered a member of the flavonoid family [36]. On the other hand, various modifications of flavonoids are very common. Hydroxyl, methoxyl, methyl, isopentenyl, methylenedioxyl, benzyl, nitro, etc., are usually substituted on A-ring and/or B-ring. Glycosidated and methylated derivatives are the main forms of plant natural flavonoids. D-glucose, L-rhamnose, glucorhamnose, galactose, and arabinose can be formed glycosidic bonds with flavonoids at the C-3 or C-7 positions [37].
## (s8) Biosynthesis of Flavonoids
(p8.0) Flavonoid biosynthesis has been widely studied and well understood. Flavonoids are produced in the cytoplasm, catalyzed by a series of enzymes that belong to shikimic acid and the phenylpropanoid pathway and the acetate pathway, and then are transported to vacuoles for storage [47,48]. Each step of flavonoids biosynthesis is catalyzed by a specific enzyme family that is conserved in higher plants [49]. Phenylalanine, at the beginning of flavonoid biosynthesis, is deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and hydroxylated by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H). Then, it is converted to 4-coumarate [50]; 4-coumarate contains a carboxyl group, which could be activated by 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) to produce 4-coumarate-CoA. Then, 4-coumarate-CoA acts as a substrate for subsequent enzymes, which also makes it become a branching point for either phenolic acids or flavonoids. The synthesis of chalcone is considered to be the beginning of flavonoids' biosynthesis. Under the action of chalcone synthase (CHS), three molecules of malonyl-CoA, the product of the acetate pathway, are condensed with one molecule of 4-coumarate-CoA to form A-ring and B-ring of typical flavonoids C6-C3-C6 skeleton. Additionally, the C-ring is formed by chalcone catalyzed by chalcone isomerase (CHI), and flavanone (naringenin) is formed in this step. A branch is arisen here for the production of flavone, and a double bond is formed between C-2 and C-3 of the naringin C-ring catalyzed by flavone synthase (FNS). Returning to the trunk, naringenin is hydroxylated by flavonone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid-3 -hydroxylase (F3 H), or flavonoid-3 -5hydroxylase (F3 5 H) to form dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin, or dihydromyricetin, respectively. Subsequently, they are reduced by dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) to form leucocyanidin, leucopelargonidin and leucodelphinidin, respectively. These leucoanthocyanidins are then catalyzed by flavonol synthase (FLS) to form kaempferol, quercetin, or myricetin, respectively [47][48][49][50].

(p8.1) There have been many studies on the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. R2R3-MYB transcription factors occupy the core position in the regulatory network, which could directly regulate the key biosynthesis genes [51]. In the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana that is heterologously expressed VvMYBF1, the accumulation of flavonoids was significantly increased [52]. Another study also showed that overexpression of VvMYBF1 in the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana induced the expression of AtPAL, AtCHS, AtCHI, AtF3H, AtF3 H, AtFLS, AtDFR, AtLDOX, and AtUFGT and enhanced the activity of corresponding enzymes [53]. In addition, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and WD40 protein also participate in the regulation of flavonoids accumulation. The MYB-bHLH-WDR (MBW) protein complex efficiently regulates flavonoids accumulation [54]. Beyond that, other transcription factors are also involved in the regulatory network. For example, a recent study indicated that three citrus AP2/ERF subfamily members act as positive factors to promote the expression of CitCHIL1, which enhances the accumulation of flavanones and flavones [55].
## (s9) Anthocyanidins
(p9.0) Given the prominent specificity and high nutritional value of anthocyanidins, they are discussed separately in this section. There are a large number of studies on anthocyanidins, which have different colors compared with other flavonoids. Anthocyanidins appear in different colors that are affected by the basic structure, co-pigmentation, metal ion complexation, and vacuole pH [4]. They make fruits and flowers appear in orange, red, purple, or blue and cooperate with other natural pigments to build gorgeous colors in plants. Proanthocyanidins (Pas) and anthocyanidins come from the same branch of flavonoids biosynthesis pathway, which mainly includes catechins, epicatechins, and their polymers, which are unique reddish-brown substances found in fruits [56]. They also determine the bitterness and astringency of the fruits and their secondary products [57]. So far, more than 600 different anthocyanidins have been identified and widely distributed in at least 27 families, 73 genera, and countless species [58].
## (s10) Chemical Structure and Classification of Anthocyanidins
(p10.0) Anthocyanidins belong to a category of typical flavonoids, also contain the basic C6-C3-C6 skeleton. The unique color of anthocyanidins comes from their conjugated bond [4]. Cyanidin, pelargonidin, delphinidin, peonidin, malvidin, and petunidin are the most common anthocyanidins. Among them, cyanidin is the most abundant in fruits that accounting for about 50% [50]. Same as the flavonoids, the chemical diversity and bioavailability of anthocyanidins are contributed by the number and location of glucosides [59]. Anthocyanidins in fruit also exist mainly in the form of glycosylation [59]. In addition, acylated anthocyanins are also found in plants, which can be further divided into acrylated anthocyanin, coumaroylated anthocyanin, caffeoylated anthocyanin, and malonylated anthocyanin [59].
## (s12) Biosynthesis of Anthocyanidins
(p12.0) Leucoanthocyanidins (leucocyanidin, leucopelargonidin, and leucodelphinidin), which are derived from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, are common precursors of anthocyanidins and flavan-3-ols [48,49]. Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), also known as leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), catalyzes three leucoanthocyanidins into cyanidin, pelargonidin, and delphinidin, respectively. As substrates, leucoanthocyanidins and anthocyanidins are reduced to (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin under the catalytic action of leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LNR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) [48,50]. Finally, anthocyanidins undergo structural modification, including glycosylation, acylation, and methylation under the catalytic action of UDP-glucose flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT), acyl transferase (AT), and methyl transferase (MT), respectively [49].

(p12.1) As a kind of important flavonoid, anthocyanidins biosynthesis is also tightly regulated by the evolutionarily conserved MBW complexes [54]. In tomato, SlAN2-like (SlMYB114) is a major transcriptional regulator that promotes anthocyanidins biosynthesis [65]. Our study also presented that overexpression of SlMYB75 (SlAN2) in tomato results in high-level anthocyanidins in various tissues [66]. In apple, a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon was found to insert the upstream of the MdMYB1 gene and enhance its expression and then activate anthocyanidins biosynthesis [67].
## (s15) Antioxidant Capacity and Detection Methods
(p15.0) Different in vitro assay methods may generate different results when evaluating the antioxidant capacity of natural pigments in fruits. This is because a single analysis method cannot take into account the following factors: the diversity and complexity of the antioxidant reaction mechanism, the distribution effect of antioxidants in a heterogeneous system, and the influence of other components in the test system. Thus, multiple assays are often used simultaneously to measure antioxidant capacity objectively [75]. The following assays are commonly used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of fruit pigments: 1,1dipheny-1-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) free radical scavenging assay, total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). These reaction principles are essentially based on the ability of artificially produced free radical scavenging to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of the substance under test [76]. Besides, the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) also partly represent the antioxidant capacity [77].
## (s16) Health Benefits
(p16.0) The natural pigments in fruits are not only powerful antioxidants, but they also have a host of other health benefits. Many studies have reported the biological and pharmacological activities of carotenoids, flavonoids and anthocyanidins, including antioxidant, anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antithrombotic, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, antimalarial, antileishmanial, antitrypanosomal, and antiamebial properties.

(p16.1) Carotenoids and their metabolites are supposed to have positive effects on several ROSmediated diseases such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, and myocardial infarction in smokers [105,106]. The epidemiological study indicated that carotene-rich foods and supplements could prevent prostate cancer to a certain extent [107]. However, there was also suggested that a high dose of β-carotene has no effect on preventing lung cancer in smokers [108]. The relationship between prostate cancer risk with carotenoids (such as α-carotene and β-carotene) has been studied for many years, but the results are mostly inconclusive [109,110]. In addition, carotenoids containing β rings with provitamin A activity can transform into retinol and play important roles in the visual system [109].
## (s17) Bioaccessibility and Bioavailability
(p17.0) Fruit natural pigments exhibit strong antioxidant activity and multiple health benefits. However, whether these beneficial bioactive compounds can be effectively used by the human body depend on their bioaccessibility and bioavailability. Bioaccessibility indicates the proportion of ingested natural pigments that are absorbed by the intestine, and bioavailability indicates the number of natural pigments that enter the blood circulation of the human body after digestion and absorption. Only this part can finally play function or be stored in the human body [68]. The primary digestive mechanisms of natural pigments determine their bioaccessibility and bioavailability. In addition, the chemical properties also affect their bioaccessibility and bioavailability. However, the chemical properties of fruit natural pigments are more unstable than other nutrients, such as sugar and organic acids. Thus, as the stability is enhanced, so does the bioavailability [124].

(p17.1) Carotenoids are abundant in fruits, but their bioavailability is not as high as expected (10-65%) [125]. Carotenoids perform powerful physiological functions only after entering the human bloodstream. Before that, carotenoids are involved in a series of digestive processes and are eventually taken by intestinal mucosal cells and then enter the lymphatic system and circulation. Many factors work together in this process, including release from the food matrix, mass transfer phenomenon, and micelle formation [126].

(p17.2) The bioaccessibility of oral phenolic compounds (including flavonoids and anthocyanidins) is 5-10% [127]. Flavonoids in fruits usually exist as flavonoid glycosides and PMFs; the modification of these substituents has a great influence on the bioactivity of flavonoids and their bioavailability. The bioaccessibility and bioavailability of flavonoid glycosides depend on the aglycone, both in its type and position. The number and position of the methoxyl group of PMFs have a decisive effect on its biological activity [68]. With the increase of the methoxyl group, PMFs exhibit higher hydrophobicity and stronger biological activity. However, it is also a double-edged sword, a high-level hydrophobicity results in poor oral bioavailability, which limits its potential application [128]. In general, compared with flavonoid glycosides, PMFs have lower polarity and approximate planar structure, higher permeability to biofilm, and easier to enter into the blood circulation in vivo [42].

(p17.3) The bioaccessibility and bioavailability of anthocyanidins were generally considered to be low, even lower than other flavonoids commonly found in fruits [123]. The conclusion was drawn by previous studies only focused on the result that anthocyanidins content in the bloodstream was very low after intake [129,130]. More and more recent studies revealed the existence of anthocyanidins molecular intermediates, which retain the unique flavonoid C6-C3-C6 backbone structure and have the characteristics that include qualitative diversity, relatively high concentrations, and tenacity [123,131]. Therefore, the present evaluation method of anthocyanidins bioavailability may be not accurate, but more evidence is needed.
