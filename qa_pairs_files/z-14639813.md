## (s9) Reduction in FPG
(p9.0) The mean reductions in FPG from baseline at weeks 12 and 52 in the overall population of each study are depicted in Fig. 3a; further stratifications by moderate RI (Fig. 3b) and

(p9.1) severe RI (Fig. 3c) subgroups are also shown. In the 12-week sitagliptin study, the difference in FPG between sitagliptin-and placebo-treated patients was -1.3 mmol/L (95% CI, -2.2 to -0.3) [16].
