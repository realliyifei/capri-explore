## (s10) Discussion
(p10.0) Majority of the registries evaluated in the present study have registry processes and belong to the United States of America (26,30,33,37,38,41,42,44,(47)(48)(49)(50)52). The high prevalence of ocular injuries in the United States compared to other countries, as well as the vital role of the registry in the prevention and control of ocular injuries has led to the creation of multiple registries in that country and therefore, the United States is leading in the field of eye registries worldwide (8). The use of registry is an important component of the eye health care system in developed and developing countries and as the main tool for managing disease data, reduces the cost of providing care and helps improve patient care delivery processes (53).
