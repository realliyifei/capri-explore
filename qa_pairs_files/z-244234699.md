## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Dairy products are one of the main trends in the food industry, in addition to be widely consumed and recognized as health promoters (Yilmaz-Ersan, Ozcan, & Akpinar-Bayizit, 2020), they also represent one of the largest segments of the functional food market (Akin & Ozcan, 2017).

(p0.1) Yogurt is one of the fermented milk products best known for being a functional food and probiotics, therefore, overtaking a great market success level overall compared to other probiotic products (Parvarei, Fazeli, Mortazavian, Nezhad, Mortazavi, Golabchifar & Khorshidian, 2021), its nutritional composition is rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins of high biological value, being available in various textures and flavors (Fabersani et al., 2018).
## (s3) Factors that affect the probiotics survival in yogurt
(p3.0) Yogurt is a fermented milk-based product that increasingly receives the addition of probiotic bacteria to improve its quality and nutritional value, increasing its beneficial impacts on health (Aryana & Olson, 2017). This effect of probiotics is due to dairy fermentation, which plays a role in aiding milk preservation by generating lactic acid, antimicrobial compounds, desirable flavor compounds, and other metabolites (Fazilah, Ariff, Khayat, Rios-Solis, & Halim, 2018).

(p3.1) Yogurt fermentation is a chemical process, in which probiotic bacteria participate, producing lactic acid as the main end product of lactose metabolism, hydrolyzing milk proteins into individual peptides and amino acids, and degrading milk lipids into free fatty acids, hence the concentration of lactic acid, pH rate, temperature and fermentation time can affect the viability of probiotics during fermentation (Das, Choudhary, & Thompson-Witrick, 2019;Yang et al., 2021), and generate difference and change in sensory properties, organoleptic and rheological (Peng, Koubaa, Bals, & Vorobiev, 2020).
## (s7) Low frequency and high-intensity ultrasound
(p7.0) A promising new technology reported in the literature to improve the viability of probiotics is low-frequency, highintensity ultrasound, which has great potential for a wide variety of applications in dairy processing (Bhargava, Mor, Kumar, & Sharanagat, 2020).
## (s8) Use of prebiotics
(p8.0) Currently, scientific studies on the effect of prebiotics on the acidification rate and viability of probiotic bacteria during the manufacture and refrigerated storage of yogurts are being discussed (Delgado-Fernández, Corzo, Olano, Hernández-Hernández, & Moreno, 2019). Due to their technological characteristics, some prebiotics can lead to improvements in the quality of products regarding sensory properties, texture, and physicochemical characteristics, in the addition of fibers and the partial replacement of sugars and fats (Xavier-Santos, Bedani, Perego, Converti, & Saad, 2019).

(p8.1) Prebiotics falls into a category of functional foods and can be defined as non-digestible food ingredients classified as soluble fiber, which beneficially affect their host by selectively stimulating the growth and activity of bacteria in the colon, thus improving the health of the host, In yogurt, the prebiotic acts as a substrate for the growth of probiotic bacteria and, consequently, improves gastrointestinal functions and the immune system (Fazilah, Ariff, Khayat, Rios-Solis, & Halim, 2018).
## (s9) 2019).
(p9.0) A recent study by Tiwari, Kavitake, Devi, and Halady (2021) presents the use of exopolysaccharides (EPS) as a potential source of prebiotics in the production of symbiotic yogurt, and according to the results of this study, EPS stimulate the growth of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus Plantarum MTCC9510 and L. fermentum MTCC903 in yogurt, and manage to maintain the viability of probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.

## (s16) Factors that affect the probiotics survival in yogurt
(p16.0) Yogurt is a fermented milk-based product that increasingly receives the addition of probiotic bacteria to improve its quality and nutritional value, increasing its beneficial impacts on health (Aryana & Olson, 2017). This effect of probiotics is due to dairy fermentation, which plays a role in aiding milk preservation by generating lactic acid, antimicrobial compounds, desirable flavor compounds, and other metabolites (Fazilah, Ariff, Khayat, Rios-Solis, & Halim, 2018).
