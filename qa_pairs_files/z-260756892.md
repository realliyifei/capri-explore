## (s1) Review Dietary intake
(p1.0) Various studies have attempted to estimate the average dietary intake of polyphenols and ETs.In a Spanish diet, the mean daily intake of total polyphenols was estimated between 2,590 and 3,016 mg/day [2].France and Denmark produced similar results of 1,193 ± 510 mg/day and 1,786 mg/day, respectively.Finland and Greece had more modest estimations with average daily intakes of 863 ± 415 mg/day and 744 mg/day, respectively.The daily intake of ET was 12 mg/day in Finland, 13 mg/day in America and only 5 mg/day in Germany [3].In France, the average person consumes around 1.7 kg of strawberries every year, which is their primary source of ETs.This would correspond to a daily consumption of around 0.4 mg/day total EA [4].As demonstrated by these studies, polyphenol and ET intake varies drastically between countries.Accurately measuring the daily intake of polyphenols is extremely challenging due to the inability to control all aspects of a subject's diet.

(p1.1) EA can occur in either its free form, EA glycosides, or bound as ETs.ETs are hydrolysed to EAs under physiological conditions and then metabolised by the intestinal gut flora to produce urolithins, which are absorbed into the circulation.The low bioavailability of ETs are likely due to their large size and high polarity with the presence of C-C linkage.ETs which are sensitive to hydrolysis in the stomach and duodenum release EAs which are also poorly bioavailable due to low water solubility, extensive degradation before absorption and its irreversible binding to DNA, which may affect transcellular absorption [5].When mice were given ETs (from raspberries or pomegranates) 10% of the total EA dose was detected in the urine and faeces.However, there was virtually no trace of it in the blood or tissues [6].In a human subject, EA was detected in plasma at a maximum concentration after one hour of ingesting pomegranate juice but was rapidly eliminated after four hours [7].
## (s2) Toxicity of ET
(p2.0) Before delving into the potential health benefits of ETs and EA, one must consider the negative effects associated with their intake.Tasaki et al. performed a toxicity study on EA using F344 rats with doses ranging between 9.4 and 42.3 g/kg of body weight.Haematology and serum biochemistry revealed sporadic alterations in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), aspartate transaminase (AST) and ALP observed in both genders but this was not felt to be treatment-related.Histological testing revealed sporadic lesions in the lungs, heart, liver and kidneys.However, incidence of lesions was similar to the control group.Body weight gain was slightly decreased in the female group but not to the extent of affecting biochemical markers.In conclusion, the no-observed-adverse-effect level in female rats was estimated to be 3,254 mg/kg/day, significantly higher than normal dietary amounts [10].

(p2.1) Polyphenols bind iron in the intestines and can prevent it from being absorbed.This can have a beneficial impact in cases of iron overload and preventing formation of oxygen free radicals which will be discussed later [11].However, it can also be detrimental and may increase the risk of iron-deficient anaemia.
## (s4) Anti-inflammatory effects
(p4.0) The effects of pomegranate extract (POMx) have been tested on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice.POMx is a highly rich source of ETs.It was found that consumption of POMx delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of CIA at doses of 13.6 mg/kg and 34 mg/kg.Activated macrophages produce several inflammatory mediators and infiltrate joints in arthritis.One such mediator is nitric oxide (NO).POMx was shown to significantly inhibit NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages at a dose of 20 µg/ml.The POMx-fed mice demonstrated reduced joint infiltration by the inflammatory cells and levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly decreased [17].

(p4.1) Endothelial cell expression of adhesion molecules has been recognized as an early step in inflammation.Papoutsi et al examined the effect of EA from walnuts on the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 in human aortic endothelial cells.Results showed that EA significantly decreased the TNF-α-induced endothelial expression of both VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 at a concentration range of 0•1-10 μm [18].Mirzaie et al. conducted a randomised controlled trial where individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBS) received 180mg of EA per day for two months.They found a significant reduction in the IBS severity score in the treatment group owing to less severe abdominal pain/distension and frequency of symptoms [19].
## (s5) Anti-microbial and probiotic effects
(p5.0) It has been shown that EA can influence the gut microflora by either destroying harmful bacteria or enhancing the growth of beneficial bacteria.When EA-rich foods, such as pomegranate, are consumed the ETs accumulate in the large intestines, where they interact with and promote the gut microflora.Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, POMx enhanced the growth of total bacteria, bifidobacterium spp and Lactobacillus spp using human faecal samples.These two groups of bacteria are associated with many health benefits.POMx did not influence the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group and the C. histolyticum group.The lack of growth enhancement in the latter group has clinical significance as it contains proteolytic bacteria, the metabolism of which have been linked to IBS and colorectal cancer [20].
## (s7) Prostate Cancer
(p7.0) EA treatment of prostate cancer PC3 cells resulted in decreased cancer cell proliferation through a reduction of phosphorylated STAT3, ERK and AKT signalling proteins after 72 hours in a dose-dependent manner (0-100 µM) [29].Other studies have reached similar conclusions by assessing different components of pomegranate such as the peel, juice seeds and seed oil (rich sources of ETs) on various prostate cancer cell lines.They consistently demonstrated pro-apoptotic and inhibitory effects on cancer cell proliferation.In vivo they demonstrated potent inhibition of PC3 xenograft growth in mice [30,31].Urolithins have also been shown to inhibit the growth of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines in vitro with IC50 values lower than EA, however, the exact mechanisms by which they exert these effects need to be investigated [32].Furthermore, the IC50 values of urolitihins were higher than what is physiologically achievable.

(p7.1) Inflammation is a hallmark of many cancers, in particular prostate cancer, and is dependent on the transcription factor NF-kB. NF-kB activation leads to immune activity, inflammation and cell proliferation whilst also upregulating the transcription genes that produce collagenases, cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines.It is also associated with the transcription of genes involved in cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis.Inflammation can result in persistent oxidative stress in cancer cells and ROS may give these cancer cells a survival advantage.EA has been shown to prevent prostate cancer growth, by inhibiting inflammatory pathways including the NF-kB pathway [32].

(p7.2) Another hallmark of cancer is angiogenesis.Sartipour et al. administered oral POMx to severe combined immunodeficient mice which had been previously injected with LAPC4 human prostate cancer cells.After four weeks of treatment POMx decreased prostate cancer xenograft size, tumour vessel density, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and HIF-1 alpha expression, thereby suggesting that POMx has an inhibitory effect on tumour-associated angiogenesis [33].

(p7.3) A clinical trial was carried out which looked at the effects of pomegranate juice on rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer patients after surgery or radiotherapy was conducted.The mean length of time for PSA to double was significantly prolonged following daily pomegranate juice consumption [34].
## (s8) Colon Cancer
(p8.0) EA was extracted from the pulp and seeds of five different types of raspberries and exerted antiproliferative effects against human colon carcinoma cells in vitro.The extent of this effect was correlated with the content of EA in the extract [35].The activation of Wnt signalling pathways are known to play a key role in human colon carcinogenesis.Using the 293T colon cancer cell line it was observed that Urolithin A inhibited the Wnt signalling pathway at physiologically relevant concentrations -IC50 of 39 μM [36].The doses of ET and EA needed to inhibit Wnt signalling were unfortunately not physiologically relevant.Cytochrome p450-1 (CYP1) enzymes are involved in the activation of procarcinogens into cancer-inducing chemicals.ET and urolithins showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of CYP1 enzymes in HT-29 colon cancer cells, whilst also demonstrating anti-proliferative effects mediated through cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and G2/M stages followed by induction of apoptosis [37].González-Sarrías et al. reached similar conclusions and found that EA, Urolithin A and Urolithin B modulated phase I and phase II detoxifying enzymes in colon cancer Caco-2 cells.The three compounds induced the expression and activity of CYP1A1 which, unlike the other CYP enzymes, is involved in detoxification [38].

(p8.1) 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) remains a first line treatment for colorectal cancer.However, only 10-15% of patients with advanced colorectal cancer respond positively to 5-FU monotherapy.Therefore, new strategies to enhance the 5-FU effectiveness are critically needed.The co-treatment of 5-FU with Urolithin A, resulted in decreased IC50 values for 5-FU and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase together with a slight increase in caspases 8 and 9 activation.Urolithin A may therefore potentiate the effects of 5-FU on colon cancer cells.This potentially means that lower doses of 5-FU could be used to achieve therapeutic effects thereby decreasing the likelihood of adverse effects [39].
## (s9) Breast Cancer
(p9.0) Polyphenols from fermented juice, pericarp and oil inhibited the growth of breast cancer cell lines in vitro.This effect was greater in the oestrogen-dependent MCF-7 line than the oestrogen-independent MB-MDA-231 line.Fermented pomegranate juice polyphenols consistently showed about twice the antiproliferative effect as fresh pomegranate juice polyphenols.Oestrogen synthesis was inhibited by a 60-80% reduction in aromatase activity.

(p9.1) As previously mentioned, a tumour needs to receive sufficient nutrients and oxygen and have the ability to evacuate waste in order to sustain growth.It achieves this through angiogenesis and VEGF is the most potent stimulator of this process.EA markedly inhibits angiogenesis-associated activities including proliferation, migration/invasion and capillary formation on VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells in vitro at doses of 2.5 to 20 μM.It directly inhibited VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity and its downstream signalling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/Akt in endothelial cells.In vivo, EA inhibited vessel formation in chick chorioallantoic membrane and sprouts formation of chicken aorta.In breast cancer xenografts, EA significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cancer growth and P-VEGFR2 expression.The authors concluded very low toxicity of EA given there were no abnormal morphological changes to the cancer cell lines and in vivo there was sprout recurrence from the chick aortic arch once EA was removed [42].To our knowledge, there have been no clinical studies performed regarding the effects of EA on breast cancer.
## (s10) Synergistic Effects of Polyphenols
(p10.0) EA is widely considered the key compound in pomegranate in terms of its anti-carcinogenic effects.However, it is believed that its action is enhanced by other polyphenols present in pomegranate.Seeram et al. compared the effect of pure pomegranate juice with individual polyphenols (EA and punicalagin) on human oral, prostate and colon cancer cells.It found that the polyphenols independently decreased the viable cell number of cancer cells but not nearly as much as the pure pomegranate juice.The juice also had a more profound effect on inducing apoptosis compared with the separated polyphenols [43].
