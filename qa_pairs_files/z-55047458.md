## (s5) Control efforts
(p5.0) The achievement of control and elimination relies largely on chemotherapy through mass drug administration (MDA). Drugs commonly administered against STH in Nigeria are albendazole, pyrantel and levamisole. These drugs have demonstrated varying egg reduction and curative rates (Table 3). There are increasing reports of mass deworming programme across the country [69,109,110], and studies have suggested that sustainable decrease in infection burden is a result of continuous use of antihelminthics [69,78].
