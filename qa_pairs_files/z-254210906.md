## (s12) Options for Increasing the Resilience of the Formal Seed Systems
(p12.0) -A basic challenge is economic sustainability of seed production. The added cost of producing quality seed compared to food grain limits commercial seed producers in the crop seeds that they produce.

(p12.1) The production of quality seed requires care such as centralized storage, treatments, transport, and packaging, which lock up vast amounts of financial resources. Administration, marketing, seed quality checks, and management add to the cost of seeds [59]. Large companies have some scale advantages, but commonly also increase transport and overhead costs.
