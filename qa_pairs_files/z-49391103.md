## (s4) The MMT model
(p4.0) The MMT equation is a one-dimensional nonlinear dispersion equation which was originally proposed by Majda, McLaughlin and Tabak [62].The MMT equation gives soliton-like solutions which have been analyzed in detail by Zhakarov [63][64][65] and gives four-wave resonant interaction between waves, which, when coupled with large scale forces and small-scale damping, yields a family of solutions which exhibit direct and inverse cascades [22].The MMT equation is given by:

(p4.1) where ψ is a complex scalar and |∂ x | α is the pseudodifferential operator defined on the real axis through the Fourier transform: The last term in ( 28) is the dissipation term, which is tuned to fit ocean waves through the Laplacian operator, Dψ, defined in the Fourier space:
