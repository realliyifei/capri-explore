## (s1) Rheumatic diseases and exosomal lncRNAs
(p1.0) Similar to tumors, rheumatic diseases exhibits complex pathogenesis, and their unclear early diagnosis and ineffective treatment effect, even the drugs treatment for rheumatic diseases were originally derived from tumor therapy.Many studies have been conducted to determine the role of exosomes in rheumatic diseases.

(p1.1) Exosomes are proved that involving in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through intracellular lncRNAs, such as the NF-κB and Wnt signaling pathways (Ren et al., 2023;Hou et al., 2020), thus affecting the expression imbalance of Th17/Treg cells and leading to the damage of synovial cells.In addition to mechanistic studies, the exosomes derived from normal stem cells have demonstrated therapeutic potential in osteoarthritis, and they can be absorbed by the chondrocytes of osteoarthritis model mice model, stimulate cell migration and proliferation and reduce chondrocyte apoptosis (Zhu et al., 2017).Owing to the excellent performance of lncRNAs in regulating gene expression, many studies have been devoted to investigating whether lncRNAs are involved in the physiological and pathological processes of rheumatic diseases.In systemic lupus erythematosus, the lncRNA TUG1 acts as a protective gene by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, thereby delaying the progression of lupus nephritis (Cao et al., 2020).TMEVPG1 is positively correlated with disease activity marker in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, including the number of CD4+ T cells, anti-SSA antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), total IgG amount, and Th1 cell ratio (Wang et al., 2016).

(p1.2) Due to the wide range of exosome sources and the fact that lncRNAs can participate in multiple pathways, the role of exosomal lncRNAs in vivo is complicated.LncRNA NEAT1 carried by exosomes derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells can induce M2type polarization of macrophages and alleviate joint inflammation (Chen et al., 2023).Another study on the exosome LncRNA NEAT1 showed that it regulates the intestinal epithelial barrier and macrophage polarization promotes the inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease (Liu et al., 2018b).In addition, in rheumatoid arthritis, the exosome LncRNA NEAT1 can also promote the proliferation of CD4+ T cells and the differentiation of Th17 cells through the WNT signaling pathway, and aggravate the occurrence of bone destruction (Liu et al., 2021).In conclusion, the same exosome lncRNA can affect different cells by acting on different pathways, but it can lead to a variety of rheumatic diseases.In order to further determine the role of a specific cell, some studies have resorted to special materials such as hydrogels to achieve targeted therapy (Zhu et al., 2022).But these studies have not been confirmed on a large scale and have not yet been used clinically.

(p1.3) Therefore, both exosomes and lncRNAs are closely related to the future development of rheumatic diseases.In this article, we summarized the recently discovered research results on the relationship between exosomal lncRNAs and rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, autoimmune liver disease, primary dermatomyositis, and systemic sclerosis in Table 2, and plotted the pathways involved in these lncRNAs in different cells and the processes affecting micRNAs and target genes in Fig. 1.We hope this article will help to explore the complex pathogenesis of related diseases and find new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.
## (s3) RA and exosomal lncRNA
(p3.0) RA is a general autoimmune disease that affects multiple systems and is common in middle-aged and elderly female patients.It is characterized by synovitis and irreversible joint damage and mainly manifests as redness, swelling, heat, and pain in the facet joints with stiffness in the morning and with or without multisystem damage (Wu et al., 2022b).This joint injury is mainly caused by the interaction of T cells, B cells, neutrophils, fibroblast synoviocytes and osteoclasts, producing antibodies to attack themselves and activating the immune pathway (van Delft & Huizinga, 2020).Since this damage to oneself can persist without interference and the body will not heal itself, diagnosis and treatment are particularly important for rheumatoid arthritis.In patients with RA, the synovial tissues are characterized by the presence of fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSs), which produce excessive amounts of cytokines, leading to persistent inflammation and irreversible damage to the joint structure (Jay, Britt & Cha, 2000).Researchers aimed to restore the homeostasis of the affected joint synovium by targeting such cells.Similarly, in the related studies of exosomal lncRNA, FLSs are often selected as research subjects, hoping to explore the possibility of diagnosis and treatment in RA by finding special lncRNA derived from or acting on FLSs.

(p3.1) Exosomal lncRNA TRAFD1-4:1 derived from FLSs can degrade the chondrocyte matrix, affect the migration of chondrocytes, and cause irreversible damage to the joints (Ren et al., 2023).CXCL-1 promotes the development of joint inflammation in RA by releasing inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and IL-17 (Hou et al., 2020;Kuwabara et al., 2017).In Ren et al. (2023), TRAFD1-4:1 was found as a highly expressed non-coding gene in RA, which affected the expression of the target gene CXCL-1 by inhibiting miR-27a-3p,
## (s4) Li et al. (2020b)
(p4.0) Note: RA, rheumatoid arthritis; OA, osteoarthritis; LN, lupus nephritis; erythematosus; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pDM, primary dermatomyositis; SSc, systemic sclerosis; FLSs, fibroblast-like synoviocytes; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; MH7A, a kind of synovial cell; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; BMSC, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; HSkMC, human skeletal muscle myoblasts cell.

(p4.1) accelerated the degradation of chondrocyte matrix in joints, and inhibited cartilage to play a joint-protective role.The exosomal lncRNA NEAT1 has been implicated in the abnormal proliferation of FLSs and the inflammation of the synovium by different pathway mechanisms (Rao et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2021).The NF-κB signaling pathway is known as an important role in the pathogenesis of RA, and p-p65 is a common indicator of the NF-κB signaling pathway activity (Duan & Li, 2018).Rao et al. (2020) found that the exosomal NEAT1 derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is involved in the pathogenesis of RA through the NF-κB signaling pathway.By searching for differential lncRNAs, they found that the NEAT1 expression was significantly higher the healthy control group.Therefore, this lncRNA may be involved in the abnormal activation of FLSs.To further explore the role of NEAT1 in FLSs, they used bioinformatics software to analyze miR-23a and SIRT6.As downstream genes of NEAT1, these two had a synergistic effect on the pathogenesis of RA through the NF-κB signaling pathway.Meanwhile, they assessed the cell viability of FLSs and the content of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-a) and p-p65 in serum and found that the levels of the above indexes in the plasma of patients were all increased compared with those of the control group.In addition to human fibroblasts, they injected NEAT1-loaded exosomes in a mice model of RA and found the same result.This further supported their conclusion that the exosomal NEAT1 derived from PBMC may participate in the pathogenesis of RA and could potentially serve as a diagnostic marker in the future.

(p4.2) Exosomal lncRNA Hotair has been implicated in the process of bone destruction in RA (Song et al., 2015).Its high expression could be detected in the peripheral blood of patients with RA.Experiments revealed that it could promote the activity of osteoclasts and activate MMP-2 and MMP-13 in synovial cells.The combined effects of Hotair on osteoclast activity and MMP activation synergistically contribute to joint damage and irreversible bone destruction.Thus, Hotair may also become a marker for disease diagnosis in the coming times.

(p4.3) In addition to causing inflammation and bone destruction in diseases, exosomal lncRNAs can exert a protective role.Exosomal lncRNA HAND2-AS1 has been found to inhibit the excessive proliferation of fibroblasts in RA patients through the NF-κB pathway and reduce the release of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-a, thereby preventing the progression of synovitis (Su et al., 2021).Further investigation into downstream regulatory genes and target genes revealed that HAND2-AS1 promotes the expression of TNFAIP3 and inhibits the regulation of miR-143-3p leading to the excessive proliferation and migration of FLSs through the miR-143-3p/TNFAIP3 axis.Moreover, HAND2-AS1 promotes the apoptosis of hyperproliferative cells, which reduces the release of inflammatory factors and allows the synovial environment to regain homeostasis.These findings open new possibilities for targeted management of the disease, offering potential therapeutic avenues for treatment.

(p4.4) The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network serves as a connection between coding RNA and non-coding RNA (such as microRNA, lncRNA, and siRNA, etc.) and this network enables the interaction and communication between these RNAs, leading to the enrichment of biological pathways, providing a possibility to explore the biological signaling pathways involving these genes (Qi et al., 2015).To note, it is common that a single gene in a disease can be involved in different signaling pathways.Through bioinformatics analysis, it has been discovered that the collaboration of these pathways often contributes to the occurrence of diseases.This coordination among pathways contributes to the complexity of disease pathogenesis.NEAT1, a special non-coding RNA, not only plays a role in the enrichment of the NF-κB signaling pathway, but also affects the proliferation and differentiation of T cells through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to the RA pathogenesis.

(p4.5) The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an crucial role in various processes, such as kidney injury and repair and tumor progression (Schunk et al., 2021;Bian et al., 2020).More recently, IL-35, an anti-inflammatory cytokine from the IL-12 cytokine family, has been found to stimulate the differentiation of osteoblasts through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and inhibit bone loss in patients with RA (Li et al., 2019).This suggests that genes enriched in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may also be involved in the pathogenesis of RA.Based on this point, Liu et al. (2021) found that NEAT1 promotes the proliferation, hyper-differentiation, and migration of T17 cells by the Wnt signaling pathway, causing the imbalance of Th17/Treg cells.This imbalance has a profound impact on the pathogenesis of RA.

(p4.6) The imbalance of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets plays a key role in RA.Th17 cells promote inflammation, while Treg cells counteract the effects of Th17 cells, maintaining immune system homeostasis (Niu et al., 2012).Yao et al. (2021) conducted a study using a self-built RA mouse model and observed the number of exosomal LncRNA HOTTIP derived from synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) was higher than that in normal mice.They also noted differences in the number of T cells in the spleen tissues of the these mice.To determine which pathway is responsible for HOTTIP production and how the number of T cells is changed, they examined the downstream genes miR-1908-5p and STAT3 and found that these genes were jointly enriched in the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.

(p4.7) In vitro experiments involving the addition of HOTTIP to the CD4+ T cell population demonstrated a significant increase in Th17 cells a concomitant decrease in Treg cell proportions.This imbalance of Th17/Treg cells stimulated the production of a large number of pro-inflammatory factors, leading to synovial tissue damage.Based on these findings, HOTTIP plays a harmful role in RA, and inhibiting its regulation of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets can prevent the aggravation of joint damage.

(p4.8) In summary, the comprehensive investigations discussed in this review have substantiated the significance of exosomal lncRNAs in the occurrence of RA.The stable expression of exosomes in the blood increases the diversity of laboratory diagnoses of the disease, and genes with protective effects bring new hope to the patients.
## (s6) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and exosomal lncRNA
(p6.0) SLE is a disease involving multiple organs and systems of the whole body.Its pathological basis is mainly vasculitis in the affected tissues, accompanied by abnormal inflammatory cell infiltration, immune complex deposition in the affected organs, etc.The pathogenesis is related to sex hormones, epigenetics, environmental factors, infection and many other factors (Tian et al., 2023).

(p6.1) According to the latest epidemiological statistics in 2023, the global incidence of this disease is about 5.14 per 100,000 people, and the number of new cases can reach 400,000 people every year (Zen et al., 2023).The harm caused by infection and irreversible damage of important organs leads to about 18.6/1,000 deaths per year (Moghaddam et al., 2021), among which kidney involvement ranks among the top three causes of death in many studies (Dhital et al., 2020).Clinically, lupus nephritis can be manifested in various manifestations such as hematuria, proteinuria, cellular uria, and renal failure (Gasparotto et al., 2020), which can be clearly diagnosed by pathological type of kidney biopsy.At present, some studies have reported specific indicators of lupus nephritis (Chen et al., 2018;Koutsonikoli et al., 2017), but they have not been verified by cross-regional populations and large samples.

(p6.2) Flores-Chova et al. ( 2023) analyzed by GO annotation and KEGG pathways multiple ncRNAs involved in inflammation, fibrosis and other pathways in lupus nephritis, including four up-regulated exosomal lncRNAs (LINC01015, LINC01986, AC087257.1,AC022596.1).By constructing lncRNA-miRNA networks between these four lncRNAs and other miRNA, they searched for the target genes.Together, these target genes were involved in inflammatory pathways such as p53, MAPK, and Ras pathway, other signaling pathways that regulate cell aging, stem cell pluripotency, thereby identifying a number of potential candidate genes as targets with therapeutic significance.
## (s7) Autoimmune liver diseases and exosomal lncRNA
(p7.0) Autoimmune liver diseases are a group of autoimmune diseases involving the liver, including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and overlap syndrome (OS).PBC and PSC are cholestatic autoimmune diseases.In addition to liver pathology, the detection of serological specific antibodies represented by antimitochondrial antibodies serves as an important diagnosis criterion for these diseases.In cases where individuals exhibit high suspicion of these diseases but test negative for the aforementioned antibodies, liver pathological examinations remain essential.Unfortunately, the worldwide adoption of liver biopsy and histopathology is limited due to variations in medical staff expertise and patient preferences.

(p7.1) In cholestatic liver disease, the accumulation of excessive of endogenous bile acids damages cholangiocytes, disruption of bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors, and changes the composition of intestinal microbiota due to bile duct structure abnormalities or abnormal bile secretion (Zhou et al., 2023).These observations indicate that, cholangiocytes become the main target cells.With the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing in experiments, many studies have identified the involvement of exosome-mediated non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of diseases.However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted in relation to cholestatic liver disease.To date, research on exosomal lncRNA H19 has been relatively comprehensive and may hold potential as a breakthrough point for future diagnosis and treatment strategies.Li et al. (2018) conducted a study in which they examined cholangiocytes from patients with PBC, patients with PSC, and mice.They discovered that the exosomes derived from cholangiocytes inhibited the expression of small heterodimeric chaperone receptor (SHP) in hepatocytes by transporting H19, thus affecting the secretion of cholesterol and bile acids.They detected the level of exosomal H19 in the serum of patients with compensated PSC and found significantly higher expression of H19 in patients with liver cirrhosis compared to healthy individuals.In a mouse model of liver cirrhosis, they found that the injection of H19 derived from severe liver damage into mildly damaged liver promoted the progression of liver fibrosis.Interestingly, injecting the same exosomes into normal mice did not cause liver damage, suggesting that H19 is not the initiating cause of cholestatic liver damage but drives the progression of the entire disease.

(p7.2) Previous studies have revealed that hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are essentially macrophages and are key cells in liver fibrosis (Higashi, Friedman & Hoshida, 2017).To explore whether cholangiocyte-derived lncRNA-H19 regulates the activation of HSCs, Liu et al. (2019) found that exosomes derived from cholangiocytes were preferentially absorbed by HSCs in many liver cells, indicating that exosomes can establish a communication pathway between stellate cells.By culturing primary HSCs, they found that the H19 carried by exosomes promoted the proliferation and differentiation of primary cells, leading to an up-regulation in the expression of fibrosis marker genes.This finding proved that H19 affects HSCs and promotes liver fibrosis by activating the proliferation and differentiation processes.

(p7.3) As a lncRNA, H19 exerts its effects on HSCs through a certain pathway.Li et al.'s (2020a) continued to make a thorough inquiry into this issue and found that H19 promoted macrophage activation through the CCL-2/CCR-2 signaling pathway, resulting in cholestatic liver injury.In the liver, the excessive accumulation of bile acids can trigger the rapid release of various inflammatory factors, including a specific chemokine-CCL-2.Its increase might recruit some pro-inflammatory monocytes to the site of injury, thus forming a local inflammatory response and resulting in bile duct epithelial cell damage (Baeck et al., 2012).Based on this, they found that the exosomal lncRNA H19 derived from cholangiocytes stimulated the differentiation of macrophages and accelerated the differentiation through positive feedback by promoting the release of cytokines, such as CCL-2, TNF-a, and IL-6.The presence of CCL-2 was significantly low in H19-free mouse macrophages, thereby highlighting its importance in the overall process.To support the results of the in vitro experiments, they knocked out H19 and found the significantly down-regulated CCR-2 expression and hindered macrophage differentiation in Mdr2-/and BDL cholestasis mouse models.This finding proved that exosomes carrying H19 could promote liver fibrosis and thus can be used as a new diagnostic marker.When used as a therapeutic target, this gene might delay the progression of liver fibrosis in patients with PBC and PSC, thereby prolonging patient survival and providing support for liver transplantation.
## (s8) Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and exosomal lncRNA
(p8.0) SSc, also known as scleroderma, is a rheumatic disease with unknown etiology and high mortality, characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, as well as vascular lesions (Denton & Khanna, 2017).Pathological manifestations of microvascular disease and endothelial cell dysfunction, under the influence of inflammatory cells and cytokines, a large number of endothelial cells into myofibroblasts, resulting in different degrees of tissue and organ damage and fibrosis (Cutolo, Soldano & Smith, 2019).Some patients present with specific skin-related clinical manifestations before experiencing involvement of internal, and in such cases, a diagnosis can be made by skin biopsy.However, many patients experience internal organ involvement as the first symptom, and most of them have poor prognoses and treatment effects.Therefore, the early clinical detection of skin changes, specific antibodies, and gene tests have become the key to diagnosing this disease.

(p8.1) Complex autoimmune responses, including innate and adaptive immunity and the production of specific autoantibodies, are the basis of systemic sclerosis (Thoreau et al., 2021).As an important link to innate immunity, neutrophils play a dual role in rheumatic diseases.On one hand, they possess a protective function through phagocytosis, helping to clear pathogens and debris.On the other hand, abnormal activation of neutrophils can lead to the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteases outside the cell, causing tissue damage and disrupting oxidative homeostasis (El-Benna et al., 2016).So far, neutrophils are involved in the occurrence of a variety of rheumatic diseases.For example, in ANCA-associated vasculitis, the excessive activation of neutrophils induces neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation, which is involved in the formation of ANCAs and the damage of systemic small blood vessels (Söderberg & Segelmark, 2016).Neutrophils are also associated with endothelial damage in systemic sclerosis-related blood vessels, which can lead to vascular remodeling and inflammation (Arad et al., 2011).Sun et al. (2023) constructed the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network interaction map of exosomes in systemic sclerosis, in which a total of 192 lncRNAs with differential expression were detected.By double luciferase reporter gene detection, it was found that lncRNA ENST00000313807 interacted with miR-29a-3p, meanwhile miR-29a-3p interacted with COL1A1.Correlation analysis showed that these three genes were correlated with imaging results of systemic sclerosis lung interstitial disease, C-reactive protein level, SCL-70 antibody titer and other clinical indicators.ROC curve analysis showed that these genes were all significant in the diagnosis of SSc.Li et al. (2020b) studied the miRNA and lncRNA profiles of neutrophil-derived exosomes in the plasma of patients with diffuse scleroderma.From the genealogy, they found 22 miRNAs and 281 lncRNAs with differential expressions that were enriched in Wnt, AMPK, IL-23, and NOTCH signaling pathways.In the future, these special genes and pathways may become potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets to enrich the existing diagnosis and treatment strategies.
## (s9) CONCLUSION
(p9.0) In this review, we summarized the research results of exosomal lncRNAs in some common rheumatic diseases.In addition, we also tried to summarize the research results on exosomal lncRNAs in other rheumatic diseases, such as polymyalgia rheumatica and ankylosing spondylitis.So far, there is no research in these fields.However, lncRNA has been found in these diseases; for example, lncRNA-NEF in ankylosing spondylitis has a role in evaluating treatment effect and predicting disease recurrence (Han et al., 2022).We will continue to follow new research development.

(p9.1) Although the research on exosomal lncRNAs have not been translated into results in the field of rheumatic diseases, the future is promising.In various studies on exosomal lncRNAs in rheumatic diseases, we can find various links in which exosomal lncRNAs with differential expression can participate.These new findings bring us to think that by detecting the levels of genes that are highly expressed in the body, such as the exosomal Hotair and NEAT1 in rheumatoid arthritis, it may be possible to help clinicians better diagnose the disease.Some research, such as exosomal PCGEM1, may fill the gap in the early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases.In addition, through in-depth study of the target genes and common pathways involved in the action of these genes, it was found that the occurrence of rheumatic diseases was caused by the abnormal activation of various immune pathways and the release of various inflammatory factors, which also provided a theoretical basis for our better understanding of diseases and targeted therapy of these pathways and inflammatory factors.

(p9.2) In addition to having diagnostic clinical significance, the differentially expressed low-expression genes can be discovered and used by more graduate students in the treatment of rheumatic diseases now or in the future to break the existing traditional treatment model.The addition of exosomes provides a good carrier for this treatment.After all, it has a recognized high safety and high stability.In a study on the treatment of bone tumors, MEG3 coated with modified exosomes can be efficiently diverted to tumor cells in vivo and in vitro for the treatment of bone tumors (Huang et al., 2022).

(p9.3) In rheumatic diseases, we also hope that exosome lncRNAs can be used to treat rheumatic diseases more accurately in actual clinical practice by modifying the transport of exosomes or special materials.
