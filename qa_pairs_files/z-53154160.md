## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Gastric cancer (GC) is currently the third leading cause of cancer-related death and the fifth most frequent cancer worldwide [1]. It has a poor prognosis with a five-year relative survival around 25% in Europe [2], and 4% when metastatic. This poor prognosis may be explained by diagnosis at an advanced stage, as well as resistance to conventional chemotherapies, with a high rate of recurrence as distant and peritoneal metastasis. Interestingly, GC incidence decreases by about 1.5% per year because of a better control of its risk factors, the main one being infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori [3]. Its eradication indeed halves the risk of GC. Other GC risk factors are autoimmune atrophic gastritis, and to a lesser degree, heredity, ethnicity, alcohol, and tobacco consumption, infection with Epstein Barr virus, and a history of partial gastrectomy [4]. Lauren's histological classification distinguishes intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma from the diffuse type [5]. Non-epithelial GCs, which are less common, are mainly represented by mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, followed by endocrine tumors and, exceptionally, stromal tumors. This review will focus mainly on gastric adenocarcinomas.

(p0.1) GC treatment consists of either surgery associated with perioperative chemotherapy, or palliative chemotherapy when diagnosed at the metastatic stage [6,7]. Interestingly, a subpopulation of cancer cells has been identified as resistant to chemotherapy and responsible for a high recurrence rate, explaining the poor prognosis of this disease [8]. Those cells are the so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs), which were identified as cells involved in tumor initiation and propagation. They are characterized by self-renewal and asymmetrical division properties, being at the origin of the more or less differentiated cells composing the tumor mass [8]. Ongoing research thus focuses on the development of more potent therapies to target those CSCs. Gastric CSCs (GCSCs) were essentially characterized by the expression of the cell-surface protein cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), and by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity [8][9][10][11][12][13]. Among the ALDH enzymes, the ALDH 1A1 and ALDH 1A3 isoforms display a retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (R-ALDH) activity, which converts vitamin A-derived retinal into active retinoic acids (RAs).
## (s1) GCSC and Biomarkers
(p1.0) In response to H. pylori infection, gastric stem cells that have the longest lifetime are susceptible to acquire genetic or epigenetic modifications that can lead to CSC formation. Another hypothesis suggests that GCSCs can also originate from bone marrow-derived stem cells that homes into the gastric mucosa in response to H. pylori infection and contributes to metaplasia and dysplasia [12,24,25].

(p1.1) It has recently been demonstrated that CSCs, which represent a small percentage of the cancer cells, are at the origin of the more or less differentiated cells in the tumor mass. Also, CSCs have particular properties compared to non-CSCs cancer cells. Their most important property is their capacity to make asymmetrical divisions in order to generate a new CSC and a more differentiated non-CSC progenitor. These differentiation properties allow CSCs to reconstitute the tumor heterogeneity observed within the primary tumor [8,26]. CSCs are able to form tumorspheres in tridimensional culture conditions in vitro and initiate tumor growth when injected in low cell numbers in immunocompromised mice. CSCs have shown increased resistance to conventional chemotherapy, for example in colorectal cancer [27,28], and radiotherapy for example in glioblastoma [29] (Figure 2 
## (s2) GCSC and Biomarkers
(p2.0) In response to H. pylori infection, gastric stem cells that have the longest lifetime are susceptible to acquire genetic or epigenetic modifications that can lead to CSC formation. Another hypothesis suggests that GCSCs can also originate from bone marrow-derived stem cells that homes into the gastric mucosa in response to H. pylori infection and contributes to metaplasia and dysplasia [12,24,25].

(p2.1) It has recently been demonstrated that CSCs, which represent a small percentage of the cancer cells, are at the origin of the more or less differentiated cells in the tumor mass. Also, CSCs have particular properties compared to non-CSCs cancer cells. Their most important property is their capacity to make asymmetrical divisions in order to generate a new CSC and a more differentiated non-CSC progenitor. These differentiation properties allow CSCs to reconstitute the tumor heterogeneity observed within the primary tumor [8,26]. CSCs are able to form tumorspheres in tridimensional culture conditions in vitro and initiate tumor growth when injected in low cell numbers in immunocompromised mice. CSCs have shown increased resistance to conventional chemotherapy, for example in colorectal cancer [27,28], and radiotherapy for example in glioblastoma [29] (Figure 2). As CSCs are more resistant to treatments than the more differentiated cancer cells, they may lead to cancer recurrence after treatment. They are therefore a potential target in cancer therapy to avoid metastasis, recurrence, and radio-chemotherapy resistances [8,26]. Their chemoresistance was shown to be associated with the expression of drug efflux systems, such as ATP binding cassette transporter proteins, as well as a high ALDH activity [30][31][32]. In vitro studies demonstrated that cancer cells expressing CD44 and ALDH initiate more tumorspheres than CD44− and ALDH− cancer cells [11]. Xenograft experiments using extreme limiting dilution analysis mathematical models demonstrated that CD44+ and ALDH+ cells initiate more tumors in vivo than cells expressing other biomarkers such as CD133 [11].

(p2.2) CD44 is expressed, at a very low level, in the isthmus of healthy gastric glands where stem cells reside. It was reported that these CD44+ stem/progenitor cells expand from the isthmus towards the base of the unit in metaplastic and dysplastic areas induced in response to chronic H. pylori infection [12,13,33]. This migration occurs via epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process in which epithelial cells acquire migratory properties of mesenchymal cells conferring CSC-like properties to CD44+ cells [13,25,34]. CD44+ cells also display other characteristic features of CSCs such as invasion [35,36], endothelial cell adhesion [37], and drug resistance [38]. A recent study demonstrated that CD44 inhibition by peptide inhibitors prevents the development of cellular hyperproliferation and chronic atrophic gastritis in animal models of H. pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis [39]. However, as CD44 is expressed in many different cancer cell types, it is not enough specific to be a putative target for GC therapy [40]. More potent CSC biomarkers were therefore screened in order to target more specifically GCSCs.

(p2.3) Interestingly, in GC, ALDH+ cells represent 1.6% to 15.4% of the tumor CSC and contain higher frequency of tumorigenic CSCs than CD44+ cells. ALDH activity was recorded mainly in CD44+ cells, As CSCs are more resistant to treatments than the more differentiated cancer cells, they may lead to cancer recurrence after treatment. They are therefore a potential target in cancer therapy to avoid metastasis, recurrence, and radio-chemotherapy resistances [8,26]. Their chemoresistance was shown to be associated with the expression of drug efflux systems, such as ATP binding cassette transporter proteins, as well as a high ALDH activity [30][31][32]. In vitro studies demonstrated that cancer cells expressing CD44 and ALDH initiate more tumorspheres than CD44− and ALDH− cancer cells [11]. Xenograft experiments using extreme limiting dilution analysis mathematical models demonstrated that CD44+ and ALDH+ cells initiate more tumors in vivo than cells expressing other biomarkers such as CD133 [11].

(p2.4) CD44 is expressed, at a very low level, in the isthmus of healthy gastric glands where stem cells reside. It was reported that these CD44+ stem/progenitor cells expand from the isthmus towards the base of the unit in metaplastic and dysplastic areas induced in response to chronic H. pylori infection [12,13,33]. This migration occurs via epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process in which epithelial cells acquire migratory properties of mesenchymal cells conferring CSC-like properties to CD44+ cells [13,25,34]. CD44+ cells also display other characteristic features of CSCs such as invasion [35,36], endothelial cell adhesion [37], and drug resistance [38]. A recent study demonstrated that CD44 inhibition by peptide inhibitors prevents the development of cellular hyperproliferation and chronic atrophic gastritis in animal models of H. pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis [39]. However, as CD44 is expressed in many different cancer cell types, it is not enough specific to be a putative target for GC therapy [40]. More potent CSC biomarkers were therefore screened in order to target more specifically GCSCs.

(p2.5) Interestingly, in GC, ALDH+ cells represent 1.6% to 15.4% of the tumor CSC and contain higher frequency of tumorigenic CSCs than CD44+ cells. ALDH activity was recorded mainly in CD44+ cells, showing that ALDH+ cells represented a subpopulation within the CD44+ subpopulation of cancer cells [11]. Nguyen PH et al. demonstrated that ALDH+ cells did not incorporate the nuclear dye Hoechst-33342 comparing to the ALDH− cells [11]. Treatment with drug efflux inhibitors such as Verapamil or Reserpin, restored the nuclear dye Hoechst-33342 incorporation in ALDH+ cells and sensitized them to conventional chemotherapy in vitro. Therefore, according to Nguyen et al., ALDH+ cells seem to be more resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs than ALDH− cells thanks to their drug efflux ability.

(p2.6) ALDH activity could thus be a putative biomarker GC chemoresistance. Unfortunately, the Aldefluor assay, used to detect CSC in vitro through ALDH activity, cannot be used to sense CSCs in tissue biopsies.

(p2.7) ALDH has many isoforms, which are expressed by 19 different genes [41]. Several studies have shown that some ALDH isoforms allow the detection of CSC on tumor tissue, but the isoform is different depending on the type of cancer and from one tumor to another. Among them, the main isoforms expressed in tumors are R-ALDH, ALDH1A1, and ALDH1A3 (to a lesser extent, ALDH3A1) responsible for the oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA [41]. They can metabolize and detoxify chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide in hematopoietic stem cells, and their high level of expression was shown to be predictive of poor therapeutic response in breast cancer [31]. Some ALDH isoforms seem, therefore, to be biomarkers of resistant CSCs.

(p2.8) These findings imply that ALDH activity and CD44 could be considered as putative targets to inhibit tumor growth and to overcome resistance to cancer therapy [11]. Treatments targeting these markers were therefore sought to improve GC prognosis.
## (s3) ATRA Historic and Targets
(p3.0) The first connection between vitamin A and cancer was established as early as 1926, by Fujimaky et al., when it was found that GC appeared in rats fed with a vitamin A-deficient diet [42]. Vitamin A could not be administrated alone as an anticancer drug because high doses of this molecule were toxic to animals and man and induced hypervitaminosis A syndrome of which main symptoms are: bone pain, dizziness, headache, hypercalcemia, and skin and hair changes. Therefore, a search for less toxic and more potent analogs of vitamin A was undertaken. The first compound that was investigated intensively was ATRA [42].

(p3.1) The first in vitro study was achieved by Breitman et al. in 1980 who demonstrated that butyrate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and RA induced differentiation of the HL-60 leukemia cell line [43]. The Shanghai Institute of Hematology therefore decided to conduct the first clinical study with 24 APL patients who were given ATRA alone; of these, 23 cases achieved complete response with differentiation of promyelocytes [44].

(p3.2) In APL, ATRA was used rather than its isomer 13cisRA because it showed better anticancer efficiency in vitro and in vivo [45]. Therefore, ATRA is nowadays considered as a current treatment for APL [17].
## (s7) Retinoic Acid Receptor β (RARβ)
(p7.0) Many studies show that ATRA induces RARβ's expression at both protein and mRNA levels [61,62], proving that ATRA might mediate its action not only by RARα, but also by RARβ. Moreover, according to Liu G et al., a loss of RARβ's expression parallels ATRA resistance in esophageal squamous carcinoma EC109 cell line [61].
## (s8) Retinoic X Receptors (RXR)
(p8.0) RXR acts, with RAR, as a heterodimer and is also a nuclear ligand-dependent transcription factor. It was therefore considered as a potential target of RA and studies were conducted to better understand whether RA signaling could pass through this latter.

(p8.1) It was shown in 1990 that ATRA could not bind RXRs. Another retinoid isomer was suspected to bind it [63], and indeed, in 1992, 9cisRA was found to bind RXRs and RARs [64] (Table 1).
## (s10) ATRA on GC Models
(p10.0) As early as in 1926, Fujimaky et al., found that GC appeared in rats fed with a vitamin A-deficient diet [86]. Then, in 1985, epidemiological studies demonstrated that vitamin A plasmatic concentration was lower in patients with gastric dysplasia suggesting that RA could have an impact on gastric carcinogenesis [87].
## (s12) ATRA's Mechanism of Action for Apoptosis Initiation
(p12.0) It has been shown that ATRA can mediate its anticancer activity by enhancing apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines, which highly express the orphan receptor TR3, and cell cycle blockage when TR3 is less expressed [93]. TR3 is also responsible for apoptosis in GC cancer cells when translocated into the mitochondria in response to 9cisRA activation of RXRα [94].
## (s13) ATRA's Mechanism of Action for CSC Properties Inhibition
(p13.0) Tumorspheres and mice subcutaneous PDX initiation have been defined as the main properties of CSCs [8,9,26]. According to Nguyen et al., ATRA inhibits tumorsphere formation and survival in a dose-dependent manner [19]. It has been demonstrated that ATRA reduces tumor growth in GC PDXs or GC cell lines xenograft models [88,96]. Moreover, it has been shown that there are less mice bearing liver metastasis, after intrasplenic xenograft of GC cells (BGC 823 and MKN45), when they were fed with ATRA rather than with a control treatment (33-50%) [97]. According to Li T et al., a combination of ATRA, Sorafenib, and miRNA in encapsulated nanoparticles also seem to have an antitumor effect in subcutaneous GC cell lines xenografted mice [88]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that ATRA downregulates the expression of CSC markers (CD44 and ALDH) and stemness genes, such as KLF4 and SOX2, and inhibits GC PDX growth in immunocompromised mice [19].

(p13.1) In conclusion, ATRA displays its anticancer action on GC by inhibiting cellular proliferation, inducing differentiation and apoptosis, inhibiting CSC properties such as tumorspheres formation and PDX growth in mice (Figure 4) ( Table 2).
## (s16) Apoptosis initiation GC cell lines Tumorspheres PDX
(p16.0) Induction of PDCD4 and cleaved caspase 3 apoptosis markers in GC cell lines, tumorspheres and in PDX models [19]. Induction of apoptosis in GC cell lines by the translocation of TR3 orphan receptor in the mitochondria [93]. Initiation of apoptosis in combination with Sorafenib and miRNA in encapsulated nanoparticles [88].
## (s17) CSC properties inhibition GC cell lines Tumorspheres PDX
(p17.0) Inhibition of tumorspheres formation and survival [19]. Reduction of tumor growth in mice subcutaneous xenografts models [19,88,96]. Diminution of liver metastasis after intrasplenic xenograft of GC cells [97]. Reduction of tumor growth in mice subcutaneous xenograft models in combination with Sorafenib and miRNA in encapsulated nanoparticles [88]. Downregulation of the expression of the CSC markers and stemness genes [19]. 
## (s18) ATRA's Anticancer Effect on Patients with GC
(p18.0) Only two studies tested ATRA on patients with GC. In 2015, Jin J et al. showed that patients with gastric dysplasia treated with omeprazole and sucralfate, associated to ATRA, presented a better attenuation of their dysplasia (68% vs. 37%) compared to patient treated with omeprazole and sucralfate alone. This was accompanied with an increased expression of the tumor suppressor pRb and a decreased expression of HER2 oncogenic receptor in patient's gastric mucosa [99].

(p18.1) Then, Hu K W et al., showed, on a cohort of 80 patients with GC, that ATRA could significantly prolong overall survival when combined with conventional chemotherapy. Also, the expression of RARα was correlated with the responsiveness to ATRA [78].

(p18.2) In this study, ATRA was added (or not) to conventional chemotherapies highlighting the possible synergic anticancer effect of ATRA with these treatments. The hypothesis of a synergy between these two treatments could be explained by a targeting of CSCs by ATRA and the rest of the tumor mass by cytotoxic chemotherapy.
## (s19) ATRA's Anticancer Effect on Non-Epithelial GCs
(p19.0) MALT lymphoma, which represents over 50% of primary gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas, [100] are associated with H. pylori infection in 80 to 90% cases [101]. Its treatment, based on the eradication of H. pylori, provides 70 to 100% remission rates in localized disease [102]. As ATRA displays an anti-cancer activity on APL and some lymphomas and sarcomas [21], questions were asked about the effect of this molecule on non-epithelial GCs.
## (s20) Association of RA and Conventional Chemotherapies
(p20.0) The synergistic effect of ATRA and conventional chemotherapies has been demonstrated in different types of cancer and in different in vitro and in vivo models. ATRA showed a synergistic anticancer effect in combination with cisplatin on squamous carcinoma cell lines [103] PDX [104] and patients [105], on cervical carcinoma cell lines [106], and on lung metastasis formation in a mousse 
## (s21) ATRA's Anticancer Effect on Patients with GC
(p21.0) Only two studies tested ATRA on patients with GC. In 2015, Jin J et al. showed that patients with gastric dysplasia treated with omeprazole and sucralfate, associated to ATRA, presented a better attenuation of their dysplasia (68% vs. 37%) compared to patient treated with omeprazole and sucralfate alone. This was accompanied with an increased expression of the tumor suppressor pRb and a decreased expression of HER2 oncogenic receptor in patient's gastric mucosa [99].

(p21.1) Then, Hu K W et al., showed, on a cohort of 80 patients with GC, that ATRA could significantly prolong overall survival when combined with conventional chemotherapy. Also, the expression of RARα was correlated with the responsiveness to ATRA [78].

(p21.2) In this study, ATRA was added (or not) to conventional chemotherapies highlighting the possible synergic anticancer effect of ATRA with these treatments. The hypothesis of a synergy between these two treatments could be explained by a targeting of CSCs by ATRA and the rest of the tumor mass by cytotoxic chemotherapy.
## (s22) ATRA's Anticancer Effect on Non-Epithelial GCs
(p22.0) MALT lymphoma, which represents over 50% of primary gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas, [100] are associated with H. pylori infection in 80 to 90% cases [101]. Its treatment, based on the eradication of H. pylori, provides 70 to 100% remission rates in localized disease [102]. As ATRA displays an anti-cancer activity on APL and some lymphomas and sarcomas [21], questions were asked about the effect of this molecule on non-epithelial GCs.
## (s23) Association of RA and Conventional Chemotherapies
(p23.0) The synergistic effect of ATRA and conventional chemotherapies has been demonstrated in different types of cancer and in different in vitro and in vivo models. ATRA showed a synergistic anticancer effect in combination with cisplatin on squamous carcinoma cell lines [103] PDX [104] and patients [105], on cervical carcinoma cell lines [106], and on lung metastasis formation in a mousse melanoma model [107]. Also, ATRA with 5fluoro-uracil chemotherapy has shown a synergistic anticancer effect on squamous carcinoma cell lines [103].

(p23.1) To further understand the mechanisms underlying this synergistic anticancer activity of ATRA and conventional chemotherapies, studies were conducted and demonstrated that: (i) ATRA inhibits cell growth and DNA synthesis [103,108]; (ii) ATRA pretreatment counteracts cisplatin resistance, and (iii) this combination reduces the fraction of CSCs and tumor dissemination [109].

(p23.2) Furthermore, it was demonstrated that ATRA displays a synergic anti-CSC effect, by facilitating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, in combination with cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil on AGS GC and Kyse-30 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line [110].

(p23.3) It has also been shown that RA interacts in vitro with conventional cytotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin and taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), to decrease apoptosis threshold and block cell cycle [22].

(p23.4) In conclusion, RA appears to have a synergistic anticancer action with conventional chemotherapies, such as cisplatin or 5fluoro-uracil, on squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cervical carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, and gastro-esophageal carcinoma.
## (s26) 9cisRA
(p26.0) 9cisRA can be generated from both its carotenoid precursors and isomerization of ATRA [131]. It is currently given to treat severe and refractory hand eczema [132]. In GC cell lines it has been demonstrated that, through the activation of RXR, 9cisRA can potentiate the ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)'s activity, which contributes to the inhibition of cell growth and tissue invasion ability, and enhances apoptosis [133].

(p26.1) Other experimentation confirmed anti-proliferative properties in thyroid cancer cell lines [134]. The combination of an RXR agonist, such as 9cisRA and PPARγ agonists, could induce maximal inhibitory effects on tumor growth and apoptosis.
## (s27) Fenretinide (RII)
(p27.0) Fenretinide (RII) is a synthetic retinoid introduced in 1993 that has shown growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in neuroblastoma [136], lung non-small cancer [137], and malignant hematopoietic [138] cell lines.

(p27.1) Liu G et al., demonstrated that RII displays growth inhibition in a BLC82 lung adenocarcinoma cell line and a BGC 823 GC cell line. Among all the cell lines he tested, EC109 esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line was the only one resistant to RA and RII in terms of growth inhibition, which parallels its loss of RARβ2 expression. Exogenous RARβ2 expression restores RII induced growth inhibition, suggesting that RII acts, at least in part, via the RARβ2 receptor [61].
## (s28) ATPR
(p28.0) Also, 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl retinate (ATPR) is a novel synthetic retinoid that inhibits subcutaneous GC xenografts growth in mice model. It also decreases expression of COX-2 and increases expression of RARβ in subcutaneous GC xenograft mice models [145]. Proteomic analysis on a SGC79-01 GC cell line treated by ATPR demonstrated that its antiproliferative activity might be mediated by inhibition of AKT's phosphorylation which inhibits cyclinE/CDK2 through FOXO1A and P27Kip1 upregulation [146].

(p28.1) ATPR better inhibits proliferation and migration of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells than ATRA. Its mechanism of action was associated with the down regulation of MLCK's expression and phosphorylation of MLC proteins involving p38-MAPK pathway which induces cellular proliferation [147].
