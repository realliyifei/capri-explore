## (s0) Background
(p0.0) It has been known for a long time that preeclampsia may be associated with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia [1]. Weinstein regarded signs and symptoms to constitute an entity separated from severe preeclampsia and in 1982 named the condition HELLP (H = Haemolysis, EL = Elevated Liver enzymes, LP = Low Platelets) syndrome [2]. The HELLP is currently regarded as a variant of severe preeclampsia or a complication [3][4][5][6][7][8][9].

(p0.1) Diagnosis of the complete form of the HELLP syndrome requires the presence of all 3 major components, while partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome consists of only 1 or 2 elements of the triad (H or EL or LP) [3,7,8,10].

(p0.2) The HELLP syndrome, a serious condition in its complete form, is associated with substantial risk for the mother and her foetus [3][4][5][6][11][12][13][14]. A wide range of complications may arise and the condition represents diagnostic and therapeutic problems; timing and method of delivery are important.

(p0.3) The aim of this review is to present an update on maternal clinical issues of the syndrome, with special focus on diagnosis, complications, surveillance, timing and mode of delivery and risk of recurrence. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are briefly outlined and controversial aspects of corticosteroid (CS) treatment are particularly discussed.

## (s2) Occurrence and clinical symptoms
(p2.0) The HELLP syndrome occurs in about 0.5 to 0.9% of all pregnancies and in 10 to 20% of cases with severe preeclampsia [15,16]. In about 70% of the cases, the HELLP syndrome develops before delivery [14] with a peak frequency between the 27th and 37th gestational weeks; 10% occur before the 27th week, and 20% beyond the 37th gestational week [6]. The mean age of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome is usually higher than in women with preeclampsia [3,17]. Most white women with HELLP are multiparous [10]. In the post-partum period the HELLP syndrome usually develops within the first 48 hours in women who have had proteinuria and hypertension prior to delivery [14]. Although variable, the onset of the HELLP syndrome is usually rapid [7]. The majority of women with the HELLP syndrome have had hypertension and proteinuria, which may be absent in 10-20% of the cases [9]. Excessive weight gain and generalized oedema precede the syndrome in more than 50% of the cases [8].

(p2.1) Typical clinical symptoms are right upper abdominal quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. The upper abdominal pain may be fluctuating, colic-like [9,18]. Many patients report a history of malaise some days before presentation [9]. Up to 30-60% of women have headache; about 20% visual symptoms [9]. However, women with a HELLP syndrome might also have unspecific symptoms or subtle signs of preeclampsia or non-specific viral syndrome-like symptoms [9]. The symptoms usually continuously progress and their intensity often changes spontaneously. The HELLP syndrome is characterized by exacerbation during the night and recovery during the day [19].

(p2.2) Women with partial HELLP syndrome have fewer symptoms and develop less complications than those with the complete form [3]. However, a partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome may develop to a complete form of the disorder [7]. Partial or total reversal of the syndrome may also occasionally occur, albeit rarely [18,20].

(p2.3) The HELLP syndrome occurs in about 0.5 to 0.9% of all pregnancies and in 10 to 20% of cases with severe preeclampsia [15,16]. In about 70% of the cases, the HELLP syndrome develops before delivery [14] with a peak frequency between the 27th and 37th gestational weeks; 10% occur before the 27th week, and 20% beyond the 37th gestational week [6]. The mean age of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome is usually higher than in women with preeclampsia [3,17]. Most white women with HELLP are multiparous [10]. In the post-partum period the HELLP syndrome usually develops within the first 48 hours in women who have had proteinuria and hypertension prior to delivery [14]. Although variable, the onset of the HELLP syndrome is usually rapid [7]. The majority of women with the HELLP syndrome have had hypertension and proteinuria, which may be absent in 10-20% of the cases [9]. Excessive weight gain and generalized oedema precede the syndrome in more than 50% of the cases [8].

(p2.4) Typical clinical symptoms are right upper abdominal quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. The upper abdominal pain may be fluctuating, colic-like [9,18]. Many patients report a history of malaise some days before presentation [9]. Up to 30-60% of women have headache; about 20% visual symptoms [9]. However, women with a HELLP syndrome might also have unspecific symptoms or subtle signs of preeclampsia or non-specific viral syndrome-like symptoms [9]. The symptoms usually continuously progress and their intensity often changes spontaneously. The HELLP syndrome is characterized by exacerbation during the night and recovery during the day [19].

(p2.5) Women with partial HELLP syndrome have fewer symptoms and develop less complications than those with the complete form [3]. However, a partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome may develop to a complete form of the disorder [7]. Partial or total reversal of the syndrome may also occasionally occur, albeit rarely [18,20].
## (s4) Diagnostic criteria
(p4.0) At present, there are two major definitions for diagnosing the HELLP syndrome. In the Tennessee Classification System, Sibai has proposed strict criteria for "true" or "complete" HELLP syndrome (Table 1) [8,9]. Intravascular haemolysis is diagnosed by abnormal peripheral blood smear, increased serum bilirubin (≥ 20.5 μmol/L or ≥ 1.2 mg/100 mL) and elevated LDH levels (> 600 units/L (U/ L) [8,32].

(p4.1) In The Mississippi-Triple Class System, a further classification of the disorder is based on the nadir PLT count any time during the course of the disease (Table 1) [7]. Class 1 and class 2 are associated with haemolysis (LDH > 600 U/L) and elevated AST (≥ 70 U/L) concentration, while class 3 requires only LDH > 600 U/L and AST ≥ 40 U/L in addition to the specific PLT count [7,33,34]. Class 3 HELLP syndrome is considered as a clinical significant transition stage or a phase of the HELLP syndrome which has the ability of progression [34].
## (s8) Maternal mortality
(p8.0) In a large retrospective cohort study comprising 442 pregnancies complicated by the HELLP syndrome, the mater-nal mortality was 1.1% [14], which is in accordance with other reports [3,9,87,88]. However, higher maternal mortality, up to 25%, has been reported [11]. Unexpected rapid death from HELLP may require forensic expertise [89]. Isler et al. found cerebral haemorrhage or stroke to be the primary cause of death in 26% and the most contributing factor in another 45% of the deaths [90]. Maternal mortality rate in hepatic rupture ranges from 18 to 86% [91].

Maternal mortality rate in hepatic rupture ranges from 18 to 86% [91].
## (s9) HELLP, perinatal mortality and morbidity
(p9.0) Perinatal mortality and morbidity are considerably higher in the HELLP syndrome than that of the mothers, and are primarily dependent on the gestational age when the condition develops [74,92]. The perinatal mortality rate related to the HELLP syndrome is between 7.4% and 34% [9,72,73]. Neonates delivered before completed 32 weeks' gestation have the highest risk of perinatal death [74,92]. According to Gul et al. the perinatal mortality was 34% before 32 weeks' gestation, and 8% after the 32nd gestational week [72]. Prematurity, placental insufficiency, with or without intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and abruptio placentae, are the leading causes of neonatal death [6,15,21]. Hepatic rupture has a perinatal mortality that can reach 80% [91].
## (s12) Corticosteroid (CS) treatment Promotion of foetal lung maturation in threatening preterm delivery
(p12.0) Irrespective of the underlying condition, preterm delivery (< 37 weeks' gestation) carries the risk of RDS in neonates because of insufficient surfactant production in foetal lungs. The neonates can be treated with CS and surfactant. Prenatal CS treatment has been shown to accelerate foetal lung maturation through a complex interaction of hormonal and intercellular signalling that leads to differentiation of the surfactant lipid-protein pathway and through less well-defined increases in lung compliance [103]. The foetal lung must be biologically ready for a CS to "trigger" maturation. In humans this window of biological readiness of the lungs seems to occur most often between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation [103].

(p12.1) Recently, betamethasone, instead of dexamethasone, has been recommended as a drug of choice for promotion of foetal lung maturation in threatening preterm delivery [104]. In clinical trials as well as observational studies antenatal CS treatment is associated with a decreased risk of IVH and CP [105]. Betamethasone may be safer and more protective of the immature brain than dexamethasone [106].

(p12.2) In a retrospective cohort study by Baud et al. comprising 883 infants with gestational age between 24 and 31 weeks it was reported an odds ratio (OR) for cystic periventricular leucomalacia of 0.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.9) for betamethasone compared with no treatment and 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.9) for the dexamethasone treated group [107]. Treatment of severe preeclampsia with betamethasone in the time span between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of RDS, IVH and perinatal death in preterm delivery [108]. A Cochrane update from 2006 advocated a single course of antenatal CS (12 mg betamethasone twice) in gestational ages between the 26th and 35th gestational weeks [109]. Thus, a single course of CS is advocated in threatening preterm delivery, including severe preeclampsia.

(p12.3) Multiple courses are more effective, but may harm the foetus Two randomized trials of women at risk of preterm delivery showed that weekly CS caused less RDS, less severe neonatal lung disease and serious neonatal morbidity and less need for mechanical respiratory support and surfactant use [110,111]. The short-term benefits supported the use of repeated doses of CS in women who remain at risk of very preterm birth 7 or more days after an initial course. However, both studies raised serious concerns about lower neonatal birth weight in the repeat course group [110,111]. Two long-term follow-up studies have been presented [112,113]. One favours the use of repeated CS courses [112]. In the other a non-significant higher rate of CP was detected in the repeat group (6 versus 1) and it was concluded that present findings indicate no evident long-term benefit, rather a possible harm, arguing that weekly administration of antenatal CS should not be offered after an initial course [113]. Repeated CS exposure may increase mortality, restrict foetal growth and cause prolonged foetal adrenal suppression [114,115]. Both repeat maternal CS exposure and early neonatal dexamethasone treatment may cause CP in preterm neonates [113,116,117]. An increase in the prev-alence of CP among very preterm deliveries (time span 24 to 30 weeks of gestational age) has been reported. Postnatal dexamethasone treatment was associated with higher rates of CP, whereas antenatal CS treatment was associated with lower rates [117]. Early dexamethasone treatment should not be recommended for the routine prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease [118].

(p12.4) Irrespective of the underlying condition, preterm delivery (< 37 weeks' gestation) carries the risk of RDS in neonates because of insufficient surfactant production in foetal lungs. The neonates can be treated with CS and surfactant. Prenatal CS treatment has been shown to accelerate foetal lung maturation through a complex interaction of hormonal and intercellular signalling that leads to differentiation of the surfactant lipid-protein pathway and through less well-defined increases in lung compliance [103]. The foetal lung must be biologically ready for a CS to "trigger" maturation. In humans this window of biological readiness of the lungs seems to occur most often between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation [103].

In clinical trials as well as observational studies antenatal CS treatment is associated with a decreased risk of IVH and CP [105]. Betamethasone may be safer and more protective of the immature brain than dexamethasone [106].

(p12.6) In a retrospective cohort study by Baud et al. comprising 883 infants with gestational age between 24 and 31 weeks it was reported an odds ratio (OR) for cystic periventricular leucomalacia of 0.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.9) for betamethasone compared with no treatment and 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.9) for the dexamethasone treated group [107].

Postnatal dexamethasone treatment was associated with higher rates of CP, whereas antenatal CS treatment was associated with lower rates [117]. Early dexamethasone treatment should not be recommended for the routine prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease [118].
## (s15) High-dose dexamethasone treatment of maternal HELLP
(p15.0) Retrospective and small randomized studies suggested that the use of high-dose dexamethasone (10 mg dexamethasone every12 hours) in the HELLP syndrome reduced maternal morbidity and induced more rapid improvement of the PLT counts. Thereby the rate of regional anaesthesia could be increased, consequently allowing vaginal delivery [27,87,[123][124][125][126][127][128]. In a publication from 2006 by Martin et al. (based on retrospective analysis and referring to experience and publications and 2 small randomised studies in the antepartum period that reported less morbidity in the treatment group), aggressive use of potent GS was recommended as a cornerstone of management for women with the HELLP syndrome class 1 and 2 or for women with class 3 HELLP syndrome accompanied with epigastric pain, eclampsia, severe hypertension or evidence of major organ morbidity [7]. CS treatment was recommended only as short-term intervention. Continuation of pregnancy for more than 48 hours after CS administration for very preterm HELLP syndrome can lead to significant maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality [7,129].

(p15.1) The largest randomized double blind, placebo controlled (dexamethasone versus placebo) study so far by Fonseca et al. included 132 women with the HELLP syndrome. The study included both HELLP occurring in pregnancy (n = 60) and after delivery (n = 72) [130]. This study could not confirm favorable results of previous small studies. Dexamethasone treatment did not reduce maternal complications (such as acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema and oliguria). The rates of platelets and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were not significantly reduced, nor was the time of recovery of laboratory test shortened, or the duration of hospital stay. The results of this study did not support the routine use of high-dose dexamethasone [130].

(p15.2) Retrospective and small randomized studies suggested that the use of high-dose dexamethasone (10 mg dexamethasone every12 hours) in the HELLP syndrome reduced maternal morbidity and induced more rapid improvement of the PLT counts. Thereby the rate of regional anaesthesia could be increased, consequently allowing vaginal delivery [27,87,[123][124][125][126][127][128]. In a publication from 2006 by Martin et al. (based on retrospective analysis and referring to experience and publications and 2 small randomised studies in the antepartum period that reported less morbidity in the treatment group), aggressive use of potent GS was recommended as a cornerstone of management for women with the HELLP syndrome class 1 and 2 or for women with class 3 HELLP syndrome accompanied with epigastric pain, eclampsia, severe hypertension or evidence of major organ morbidity [7]. CS treatment was recommended only as short-term intervention. Continuation of pregnancy for more than 48 hours after CS administration for very preterm HELLP syndrome can lead to significant maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality [7,129].

Dexamethasone treatment did not reduce maternal complications (such as acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema and oliguria). The rates of platelets and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were not significantly reduced, nor was the time of recovery of laboratory test shortened, or the duration of hospital stay. The results of this study did not support the routine use of high-dose dexamethasone [130].
## (s16) Summary and general comments on CS therapy in the HELLP syndrome
(p16.0) In threatening preterm delivery a single course of CS has documented clinical benefit for the foetus without adverse effects. Multiple courses should be avoided, except well-structured research protocols [131]. Although CS treatment has been shown to be effective in severe preeclampsia, it seems to be less beneficial in the HELLP syndrome [9]. The largest randomized trial on high-dose dexamethasone did not support high-dose dexamethasone treatment of the mother with the HELLP syndrome. Its routine use is disregarded by Sibai who advocates standard-dose CS treatment (either 2 doses of betamethasone every 12 hours intramuscularly, or 6 mg dexamethasone intravenously every 12 hour) to improve perinatal outcome in the HELLP syndrome diagnosed between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation and then deliver 24 hours after the last dose of CS [9].

(p16.1) In a recent review, Vidaeff and Yeomas pointed out that available evidence does not support that CS treatment can improve the outcome of pregnancies affected by the HELLP syndrome either antepartum and/or post-partum. Benefits from CS treatment for disease modification in the HELLP syndrome should individually be compared with immediate delivery, the current gold standard [132]. Thus, there is strong evidence for a single course of standard CS treatment in preterm delivery, including severe preeclampsia, but no conclusive evidence supporting CS treatment of the HELLP syndrome.

(p16.2) In threatening preterm delivery a single course of CS has documented clinical benefit for the foetus without adverse effects. Multiple courses should be avoided, except well-structured research protocols [131]. Although CS treatment has been shown to be effective in severe preeclampsia, it seems to be less beneficial in the HELLP syndrome [9]. The largest randomized trial on high-dose dexamethasone did not support high-dose dexamethasone treatment of the mother with the HELLP syndrome. Its routine use is disregarded by Sibai who advocates standard-dose CS treatment (either 2 doses of betamethasone every 12 hours intramuscularly, or 6 mg dexamethasone intravenously every 12 hour) to improve perinatal outcome in the HELLP syndrome diagnosed between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation and then deliver 24 hours after the last dose of CS [9].

(p16.3) In a recent review, Vidaeff and Yeomas pointed out that available evidence does not support that CS treatment can improve the outcome of pregnancies affected by the HELLP syndrome either antepartum and/or post-partum. Benefits from CS treatment for disease modification in the HELLP syndrome should individually be compared with immediate delivery, the current gold standard [132]. Thus, there is strong evidence for a single course of standard CS treatment in preterm delivery, including severe preeclampsia, but no conclusive evidence supporting CS treatment of the HELLP syndrome.
## (s17) Practical approach towards a woman with a suspect or diagnosed HELLP syndrome
(p17.0) The first step is to evaluate the patient. The clinical maternal status, gestational age (ultrasound determined), presence of labour and cervical Bishop score should be determined. The laboratory examination must include complete blood cell count, in particular PLT count, coagulation parameters, AST, LDH and haptoglobin and urine examination. Blood pressure measurement, ultrasound examination and foetal assessment tests (Cardiotocography and Doppler examination) are important [5]. The next step is to stabilize the maternal clinical condition with intravenous fluids, antihypertensive drugs (e.g. labetalol or nifedipine) and magnesium sulphate to prevent convulsions [5,7,9,15]. It is of utmost importance to monitor closely maternal vital signs and fluid balance [5].

(p17.1) We agree with the proposal by Sibai [9] and others [7,133] who do not generally recommend immediate Caesarean section, but advocate vaginal or Caesarean delivery 24 to 48 hours after CS treatment for maximum maternal and foetal benefits. However, according to recent literature there is no strong evidence for beneficial effects following CS treatment in the HELLP syndrome. If the HELLP syndrome develops before 24 weeks' gestation, termination of pregnancy should be strongly considered [134].

(p17.2) The first step is to evaluate the patient. The clinical maternal status, gestational age (ultrasound determined), presence of labour and cervical Bishop score should be determined. The laboratory examination must include complete blood cell count, in particular PLT count, coagulation parameters, AST, LDH and haptoglobin and urine examination. Blood pressure measurement, ultrasound examination and foetal assessment tests (Cardiotocography and Doppler examination) are important [5]. The next step is to stabilize the maternal clinical condition with intravenous fluids, antihypertensive drugs (e.g. labetalol or nifedipine) and magnesium sulphate to prevent convulsions [5,7,9,15]. It is of utmost importance to monitor closely maternal vital signs and fluid balance [5].

(p17.3) We agree with the proposal by Sibai [9] and others [7,133] who do not generally recommend immediate Caesarean section, but advocate vaginal or Caesarean delivery 24 to 48 hours after CS treatment for maximum maternal and foetal benefits. However, according to recent literature there is no strong evidence for beneficial effects following CS treatment in the HELLP syndrome. If the HELLP syndrome develops before 24 weeks' gestation, termination of pregnancy should be strongly considered [134].
## (s19) Timing and mode of delivery
(p19.0) We have not identified any randomized trial comparing maternal and neonatal outcome after vaginal delivery or Caesarean section for women with the HELLP syndrome. The indication of delivery, timing and method of delivery of the HELLP syndrome is more or less depending on experience and local traditions and there is no general agreement. A woman with a class 3 HELLP syndrome could await spontaneous onset of delivery at term [15]. Pregnant women with moderate (class 2), complete or severe (class 1) HELLP syndrome with completed 34 weeks' gestation should be delivered immediately after control of maternal hypertension [15]. The route of delivery should be selected on obstetric indications including cervical status, obstetric history, the maternal and the foetal condition. If the cervix is unfavourable for induction of labour, cervical ripening should be the first step [21].

(p19.1) Before 34 weeks' gestation, delivery should be chosen if the maternal condition cannot be controlled rapidly, if the maternal condition worsens or signs of intrauterine foetal distress develop. Maternal indications for immedi-ate delivery include blood pressure > 160/110 mmHg despite treatment with antihypertensive drugs, persisting or worsening clinical symptoms, deteriorating renal function, severe ascites, abruptio placentae, oliguria, pulmonary oedema or eclampsia [72]. In such cases most clinicians probably will prefer Caesarean section.

(p19.2) In pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation a full course of CS is advocated after maternal stabilization (particularly blood pressure and coagulation abnormalities) followed by induced delivery after 24 hours [7,9]. However, as mentioned, the support for this regimen is weak. Caesarean section should be performed in women who develop HELLP syndrome before 30 weeks' gestation [9,142] and in those in whom oligohydramnion and/or unfavourable Bishop score are diagnosed [9]. Regional anaesthesia is indicated for cases with PLT counts below 100·10 9 /L. However, epidural anaesthesia is contraindicated if the PLT count is below 75·10 9 /L [9]. Some authors also claim that regional anaesthesia is contraindicated if the platelet count is below 100·10 9 /L [143]. Platelet transfusion prior to Caesarean section has been suggested for class 1 HELLP syndrome, and for those with vaginal delivery and PLT count below 20 to 25·10 9 /L [21]. Antihypertensive drug is administered to keep blood pressure below 155/105 mmHg, and the woman should be monitored closely for at least 48 hours after delivery [10]. Most patients show evidence of resolution during this time.

(p19.3) We have not identified any randomized trial comparing maternal and neonatal outcome after vaginal delivery or Caesarean section for women with the HELLP syndrome. The indication of delivery, timing and method of delivery of the HELLP syndrome is more or less depending on experience and local traditions and there is no general agreement. A woman with a class 3 HELLP syndrome could await spontaneous onset of delivery at term [15]. Pregnant women with moderate (class 2), complete or severe (class 1) HELLP syndrome with completed 34 weeks' gestation should be delivered immediately after control of maternal hypertension [15]. The route of delivery should be selected on obstetric indications including cervical status, obstetric history, the maternal and the foetal condition. If the cervix is unfavourable for induction of labour, cervical ripening should be the first step [21].

(p19.4) Before 34 weeks' gestation, delivery should be chosen if the maternal condition cannot be controlled rapidly, if the maternal condition worsens or signs of intrauterine foetal distress develop. Maternal indications for immedi-ate delivery include blood pressure > 160/110 mmHg despite treatment with antihypertensive drugs, persisting or worsening clinical symptoms, deteriorating renal function, severe ascites, abruptio placentae, oliguria, pulmonary oedema or eclampsia [72]. In such cases most clinicians probably will prefer Caesarean section.

(p19.5) In pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation a full course of CS is advocated after maternal stabilization (particularly blood pressure and coagulation abnormalities) followed by induced delivery after 24 hours [7,9]. However, as mentioned, the support for this regimen is weak. Caesarean section should be performed in women who develop HELLP syndrome before 30 weeks' gestation [9,142] and in those in whom oligohydramnion and/or unfavourable Bishop score are diagnosed [9]. Regional anaesthesia is indicated for cases with PLT counts below 100·10 9 /L. However, epidural anaesthesia is contraindicated if the PLT count is below 75·10 9 /L [9]. Some authors also claim that regional anaesthesia is contraindicated if the platelet count is below 100·10 9 /L [143]. Platelet transfusion prior to Caesarean section has been suggested for class 1 HELLP syndrome, and for those with vaginal delivery and PLT count below 20 to 25·10 9 /L [21]. Antihypertensive drug is administered to keep blood pressure below 155/105 mmHg, and the woman should be monitored closely for at least 48 hours after delivery [10]. Most patients show evidence of resolution during this time.
## (s20) Management of post-partum HELLP syndrome
(p20.0) In most women with a HELLP syndrome, the maternal PLT counts continue to decrease immediately post-partum with an increasing trend on the third day [6]. About 30% of the HELLP syndromes develop after birth; the majority within the first 48 hours. However, the time of onset might range from a few hours to 7 days after delivery [10]. In women with post-partum HELLP syndrome, risk of renal failure and pulmonary oedema is significantly increased compared to those with an antenatal onset [59,86]. Since early post-partum administration of highdose CS might accelerate recovery [128], its routine administration is highly advocated (10 mg of dexamethasone every 12 hours) [6,[144][145][146].

(p20.1) However, a randomized study showed that adjunctive use of intravenous dexamethasone for postpartum patients with severe preeclampsia did not reduce disease severity or duration [147]. Moreover, the benefit of dexamethasone in post-partum HELLP syndrome was not verified in a randomized placebo controlled trial on 105 women with postpartum HELLP syndrome. There was no difference in maternal morbidity, duration of hospital stay, need for rescue scheme or the use of blood products between the groups, nor was there any difference with respect to the pattern of PLT count, recovery, AST, LDH, haemoglobin or diuresis. These findings did not support the use of dexamethasone in the puerperium for recovery of women with HELLP [148].

(p20.2) Women with a HELLP syndrome who demonstrate progressive elevation of bilirubin or creatinine for more than 72 hours after delivery may benefit from plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma [149][150][151]. In the case of continuing haemolysis, persistent thrombocytopenia and hypoproteinaemia, post-partum erythrocyte and thrombocyte substitution, as well as albumin supplementation, are standard treatment regimens [5,21]. In a recent study of women with class 1 HELLP syndrome adding of platelet transfusion to standard CS administration did not increase the recovery rate [152]. Ertan et al. treated women with diuresis problems in the postpartum period with furosemide and applied prophylaxis with antithrombin or low-dose heparin for DIC [5]. A meta-analysis concluded that furosemide was not beneficial to prevent or treat acute renal failure in adults [153]. Too little fluid can exacerbate an already vasoconstricted intravascular volume and lead to renal injury in severe preeclampsia or in the HELLP syndrome. A bolus intravenous fluid of 250-500 ml is advocated if oliguria persists, and, if necessary, central monitoring of the patient [6].

(p20.3) Some patients with the HELLP syndrome, especially those with DIC, may demonstrate delayed resolution or even deterioration in the post-partum period [101]. Therefore, the use of heparin has been proposed for patients with preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome and DIC. A retrospective analysis of women with DIC in the post-partum period revealed that 6 of 9 developed post-partum bleeding including retroperitoneal haematoma. Treatment with heparin was discouraged for post-partum bleeding [84]. Thus, most authors oppose the routine use of heparin.

(p20.4) In most women with a HELLP syndrome, the maternal PLT counts continue to decrease immediately post-partum with an increasing trend on the third day [6]. About 30% of the HELLP syndromes develop after birth; the majority within the first 48 hours. However, the time of onset might range from a few hours to 7 days after delivery [10]. In women with post-partum HELLP syndrome, risk of renal failure and pulmonary oedema is significantly increased compared to those with an antenatal onset [59,86]. Since early post-partum administration of highdose CS might accelerate recovery [128], its routine administration is highly advocated (10 mg of dexamethasone every 12 hours) [6,[144][145][146].

(p20.5) However, a randomized study showed that adjunctive use of intravenous dexamethasone for postpartum patients with severe preeclampsia did not reduce disease severity or duration [147]. Moreover, the benefit of dexamethasone in post-partum HELLP syndrome was not verified in a randomized placebo controlled trial on 105 women with postpartum HELLP syndrome. There was no difference in maternal morbidity, duration of hospital stay, need for rescue scheme or the use of blood products between the groups, nor was there any difference with respect to the pattern of PLT count, recovery, AST, LDH, haemoglobin or diuresis. These findings did not support the use of dexamethasone in the puerperium for recovery of women with HELLP [148].

(p20.6) Women with a HELLP syndrome who demonstrate progressive elevation of bilirubin or creatinine for more than 72 hours after delivery may benefit from plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma [149][150][151]. In the case of continuing haemolysis, persistent thrombocytopenia and hypoproteinaemia, post-partum erythrocyte and thrombocyte substitution, as well as albumin supplementation, are standard treatment regimens [5,21]. In a recent study of women with class 1 HELLP syndrome adding of platelet transfusion to standard CS administration did not increase the recovery rate [152].

A meta-analysis concluded that furosemide was not beneficial to prevent or treat acute renal failure in adults [153]. Too little fluid can exacerbate an already vasoconstricted intravascular volume and lead to renal injury in severe preeclampsia or in the HELLP syndrome. A bolus intravenous fluid of 250-500 ml is advocated if oliguria persists, and, if necessary, central monitoring of the patient [6].

(p20.7) Some patients with the HELLP syndrome, especially those with DIC, may demonstrate delayed resolution or even deterioration in the post-partum period [101]. Therefore, the use of heparin has been proposed for patients with preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome and DIC. A retrospective analysis of women with DIC in the post-partum period revealed that 6 of 9 developed post-partum bleeding including retroperitoneal haematoma. Treatment with heparin was discouraged for post-partum bleeding [84]. Thus, most authors oppose the routine use of heparin.
## (s21) Risk of recurrence and pre-conceptional counselling
(p21.0) Sibai has shown that oral contraceptives are safe in women with a prior HELLP syndrome [8]. Women with a history of the HELLP syndrome carry an increased risk of at least 20% (range 5-52%) that some form of gestational hypertension will recur in a subsequent gestation [7,11,101,142,154].

(p21.1) In a subsequent pregnancy, women with a history of HELLP syndrome at or before 28 weeks' gestation during the index pregnancy are at increased risk for several obstetric complications (preterm birth, pregnancy-induced hypertension and increased neonatal mortality) [154]. In patients with prior severe, early-onset preeclampsia thrombophilia screening has been suggested and should include search for protein S deficiency, activated protein C resistance (APC resistance), hyperhomocysteinemia and anti-phospholipid antibodies (both lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anti-cardiolipin) [155].

(p21.2) Sibai has shown that oral contraceptives are safe in women with a prior HELLP syndrome [8]. Women with a history of the HELLP syndrome carry an increased risk of at least 20% (range 5-52%) that some form of gestational hypertension will recur in a subsequent gestation [7,11,101,142,154].

## (s26) Background
(p26.0) It has been known for a long time that preeclampsia may be associated with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia [1]. Weinstein regarded signs and symptoms to constitute an entity separated from severe preeclampsia and in 1982 named the condition HELLP (H = Haemolysis, EL = Elevated Liver enzymes, LP = Low Platelets) syndrome [2]. The HELLP is currently regarded as a variant of severe preeclampsia or a complication [3][4][5][6][7][8][9].

(p26.1) Diagnosis of the complete form of the HELLP syndrome requires the presence of all 3 major components, while partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome consists of only 1 or 2 elements of the triad (H or EL or LP) [3,7,8,10].

(p26.2) The HELLP syndrome, a serious condition in its complete form, is associated with substantial risk for the mother and her foetus [3][4][5][6][11][12][13][14]. A wide range of complications may arise and the condition represents diagnostic and therapeutic problems; timing and method of delivery are important.

(p26.3) The aim of this review is to present an update on maternal clinical issues of the syndrome, with special focus on diagnosis, complications, surveillance, timing and mode of delivery and risk of recurrence. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are briefly outlined and controversial aspects of corticosteroid (CS) treatment are particularly discussed.

## (s28) Occurrence and clinical symptoms
(p28.0) The HELLP syndrome occurs in about 0.5 to 0.9% of all pregnancies and in 10 to 20% of cases with severe preeclampsia [15,16]. In about 70% of the cases, the HELLP syndrome develops before delivery [14] with a peak frequency between the 27th and 37th gestational weeks; 10% occur before the 27th week, and 20% beyond the 37th gestational week [6]. The mean age of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome is usually higher than in women with preeclampsia [3,17]. Most white women with HELLP are multiparous [10]. In the post-partum period the HELLP syndrome usually develops within the first 48 hours in women who have had proteinuria and hypertension prior to delivery [14]. Although variable, the onset of the HELLP syndrome is usually rapid [7]. The majority of women with the HELLP syndrome have had hypertension and proteinuria, which may be absent in 10-20% of the cases [9]. Excessive weight gain and generalized oedema precede the syndrome in more than 50% of the cases [8].

(p28.1) Typical clinical symptoms are right upper abdominal quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. The upper abdominal pain may be fluctuating, colic-like [9,18]. Many patients report a history of malaise some days before presentation [9]. Up to 30-60% of women have headache; about 20% visual symptoms [9]. However, women with a HELLP syndrome might also have unspecific symptoms or subtle signs of preeclampsia or non-specific viral syndrome-like symptoms [9]. The symptoms usually continuously progress and their intensity often changes spontaneously. The HELLP syndrome is characterized by exacerbation during the night and recovery during the day [19].

(p28.2) Women with partial HELLP syndrome have fewer symptoms and develop less complications than those with the complete form [3]. However, a partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome may develop to a complete form of the disorder [7]. Partial or total reversal of the syndrome may also occasionally occur, albeit rarely [18,20].

(p28.3) The HELLP syndrome occurs in about 0.5 to 0.9% of all pregnancies and in 10 to 20% of cases with severe preeclampsia [15,16]. In about 70% of the cases, the HELLP syndrome develops before delivery [14] with a peak frequency between the 27th and 37th gestational weeks; 10% occur before the 27th week, and 20% beyond the 37th gestational week [6]. The mean age of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome is usually higher than in women with preeclampsia [3,17]. Most white women with HELLP are multiparous [10]. In the post-partum period the HELLP syndrome usually develops within the first 48 hours in women who have had proteinuria and hypertension prior to delivery [14]. Although variable, the onset of the HELLP syndrome is usually rapid [7]. The majority of women with the HELLP syndrome have had hypertension and proteinuria, which may be absent in 10-20% of the cases [9]. Excessive weight gain and generalized oedema precede the syndrome in more than 50% of the cases [8].

(p28.4) Typical clinical symptoms are right upper abdominal quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. The upper abdominal pain may be fluctuating, colic-like [9,18]. Many patients report a history of malaise some days before presentation [9]. Up to 30-60% of women have headache; about 20% visual symptoms [9].

The symptoms usually continuously progress and their intensity often changes spontaneously. The HELLP syndrome is characterized by exacerbation during the night and recovery during the day [19].

(p28.5) Women with partial HELLP syndrome have fewer symptoms and develop less complications than those with the complete form [3]. However, a partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome may develop to a complete form of the disorder [7]. Partial or total reversal of the syndrome may also occasionally occur, albeit rarely [18,20].
## (s30) Diagnostic criteria
(p30.0) At present, there are two major definitions for diagnosing the HELLP syndrome. In the Tennessee Classification System, Sibai has proposed strict criteria for "true" or "complete" HELLP syndrome (Table 1) [8,9]. Intravascular haemolysis is diagnosed by abnormal peripheral blood smear, increased serum bilirubin (≥ 20.5 μmol/L or ≥ 1.2 mg/100 mL) and elevated LDH levels (> 600 units/L (U/ L) [8,32].

(p30.1) In The Mississippi-Triple Class System, a further classification of the disorder is based on the nadir PLT count any time during the course of the disease (Table 1) [7]. Class 1 and class 2 are associated with haemolysis (LDH > 600 U/L) and elevated AST (≥ 70 U/L) concentration, while class 3 requires only LDH > 600 U/L and AST ≥ 40 U/L in addition to the specific PLT count [7,33,34]. Class 3 HELLP syndrome is considered as a clinical significant transition stage or a phase of the HELLP syndrome which has the ability of progression [34].
## (s34) Maternal mortality
(p34.0) In a large retrospective cohort study comprising 442 pregnancies complicated by the HELLP syndrome, the mater-nal mortality was 1.1% [14], which is in accordance with other reports [3,9,87,88]. However, higher maternal mortality, up to 25%, has been reported [11]. Unexpected rapid death from HELLP may require forensic expertise [89]. Isler et al. found cerebral haemorrhage or stroke to be the primary cause of death in 26% and the most contributing factor in another 45% of the deaths [90]. Maternal mortality rate in hepatic rupture ranges from 18 to 86% [91].

Isler et al. found cerebral haemorrhage or stroke to be the primary cause of death in 26% and the most contributing factor in another 45% of the deaths [90]. Maternal mortality rate in hepatic rupture ranges from 18 to 86% [91].
## (s35) HELLP, perinatal mortality and morbidity
(p35.0) Perinatal mortality and morbidity are considerably higher in the HELLP syndrome than that of the mothers, and are primarily dependent on the gestational age when the condition develops [74,92]. The perinatal mortality rate related to the HELLP syndrome is between 7.4% and 34% [9,72,73]. Neonates delivered before completed 32 weeks' gestation have the highest risk of perinatal death [74,92]. According to Gul et al. the perinatal mortality was 34% before 32 weeks' gestation, and 8% after the 32nd gestational week [72]. Prematurity, placental insufficiency, with or without intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and abruptio placentae, are the leading causes of neonatal death [6,15,21]. Hepatic rupture has a perinatal mortality that can reach 80% [91].
## (s38) Corticosteroid (CS) treatment Promotion of foetal lung maturation in threatening preterm delivery
(p38.0) Irrespective of the underlying condition, preterm delivery (< 37 weeks' gestation) carries the risk of RDS in neonates because of insufficient surfactant production in foetal lungs. The neonates can be treated with CS and surfactant. Prenatal CS treatment has been shown to accelerate foetal lung maturation through a complex interaction of hormonal and intercellular signalling that leads to differentiation of the surfactant lipid-protein pathway and through less well-defined increases in lung compliance [103]. The foetal lung must be biologically ready for a CS to "trigger" maturation. In humans this window of biological readiness of the lungs seems to occur most often between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation [103].

(p38.1) Recently, betamethasone, instead of dexamethasone, has been recommended as a drug of choice for promotion of foetal lung maturation in threatening preterm delivery [104]. In clinical trials as well as observational studies antenatal CS treatment is associated with a decreased risk of IVH and CP [105]. Betamethasone may be safer and more protective of the immature brain than dexamethasone [106].

(p38.2) In a retrospective cohort study by Baud et al. comprising 883 infants with gestational age between 24 and 31 weeks it was reported an odds ratio (OR) for cystic periventricular leucomalacia of 0.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.9) for betamethasone compared with no treatment and 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.9) for the dexamethasone treated group [107]. Treatment of severe preeclampsia with betamethasone in the time span between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of RDS, IVH and perinatal death in preterm delivery [108]. A Cochrane update from 2006 advocated a single course of antenatal CS (12 mg betamethasone twice) in gestational ages between the 26th and 35th gestational weeks [109]. Thus, a single course of CS is advocated in threatening preterm delivery, including severe preeclampsia.

(p38.3) Multiple courses are more effective, but may harm the foetus Two randomized trials of women at risk of preterm delivery showed that weekly CS caused less RDS, less severe neonatal lung disease and serious neonatal morbidity and less need for mechanical respiratory support and surfactant use [110,111]. The short-term benefits supported the use of repeated doses of CS in women who remain at risk of very preterm birth 7 or more days after an initial course. However, both studies raised serious concerns about lower neonatal birth weight in the repeat course group [110,111]. Two long-term follow-up studies have been presented [112,113]. One favours the use of repeated CS courses [112]. In the other a non-significant higher rate of CP was detected in the repeat group (6 versus 1) and it was concluded that present findings indicate no evident long-term benefit, rather a possible harm, arguing that weekly administration of antenatal CS should not be offered after an initial course [113]. Repeated CS exposure may increase mortality, restrict foetal growth and cause prolonged foetal adrenal suppression [114,115]. Both repeat maternal CS exposure and early neonatal dexamethasone treatment may cause CP in preterm neonates [113,116,117]. An increase in the prev-alence of CP among very preterm deliveries (time span 24 to 30 weeks of gestational age) has been reported. Postnatal dexamethasone treatment was associated with higher rates of CP, whereas antenatal CS treatment was associated with lower rates [117]. Early dexamethasone treatment should not be recommended for the routine prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease [118].

(p38.4) Irrespective of the underlying condition, preterm delivery (< 37 weeks' gestation) carries the risk of RDS in neonates because of insufficient surfactant production in foetal lungs. The neonates can be treated with CS and surfactant.

Postnatal dexamethasone treatment was associated with higher rates of CP, whereas antenatal CS treatment was associated with lower rates [117]. Early dexamethasone treatment should not be recommended for the routine prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease [118].
## (s41) High-dose dexamethasone treatment of maternal HELLP
(p41.0) Retrospective and small randomized studies suggested that the use of high-dose dexamethasone (10 mg dexamethasone every12 hours) in the HELLP syndrome reduced maternal morbidity and induced more rapid improvement of the PLT counts. Thereby the rate of regional anaesthesia could be increased, consequently allowing vaginal delivery [27,87,[123][124][125][126][127][128]. In a publication from 2006 by Martin et al. (based on retrospective analysis and referring to experience and publications and 2 small randomised studies in the antepartum period that reported less morbidity in the treatment group), aggressive use of potent GS was recommended as a cornerstone of management for women with the HELLP syndrome class 1 and 2 or for women with class 3 HELLP syndrome accompanied with epigastric pain, eclampsia, severe hypertension or evidence of major organ morbidity [7]. CS treatment was recommended only as short-term intervention. Continuation of pregnancy for more than 48 hours after CS administration for very preterm HELLP syndrome can lead to significant maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality [7,129].

(p41.1) The largest randomized double blind, placebo controlled (dexamethasone versus placebo) study so far by Fonseca et al. included 132 women with the HELLP syndrome. The study included both HELLP occurring in pregnancy (n = 60) and after delivery (n = 72) [130]. This study could not confirm favorable results of previous small studies. Dexamethasone treatment did not reduce maternal complications (such as acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema and oliguria). The rates of platelets and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were not significantly reduced, nor was the time of recovery of laboratory test shortened, or the duration of hospital stay. The results of this study did not support the routine use of high-dose dexamethasone [130].

## (s42) Summary and general comments on CS therapy in the HELLP syndrome
(p42.0) In threatening preterm delivery a single course of CS has documented clinical benefit for the foetus without adverse effects. Multiple courses should be avoided, except well-structured research protocols [131]. Although CS treatment has been shown to be effective in severe preeclampsia, it seems to be less beneficial in the HELLP syndrome [9]. The largest randomized trial on high-dose dexamethasone did not support high-dose dexamethasone treatment of the mother with the HELLP syndrome. Its routine use is disregarded by Sibai who advocates standard-dose CS treatment (either 2 doses of betamethasone every 12 hours intramuscularly, or 6 mg dexamethasone intravenously every 12 hour) to improve perinatal outcome in the HELLP syndrome diagnosed between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation and then deliver 24 hours after the last dose of CS [9].

(p42.1) In a recent review, Vidaeff and Yeomas pointed out that available evidence does not support that CS treatment can improve the outcome of pregnancies affected by the HELLP syndrome either antepartum and/or post-partum. Benefits from CS treatment for disease modification in the HELLP syndrome should individually be compared with immediate delivery, the current gold standard [132]. Thus, there is strong evidence for a single course of standard CS treatment in preterm delivery, including severe preeclampsia, but no conclusive evidence supporting CS treatment of the HELLP syndrome.

(p42.3) In a recent review, Vidaeff and Yeomas pointed out that available evidence does not support that CS treatment can improve the outcome of pregnancies affected by the HELLP syndrome either antepartum and/or post-partum. Benefits from CS treatment for disease modification in the HELLP syndrome should individually be compared with immediate delivery, the current gold standard [132]. Thus, there is strong evidence for a single course of standard CS treatment in preterm delivery, including severe preeclampsia, but no conclusive evidence supporting CS treatment of the HELLP syndrome.
## (s43) Practical approach towards a woman with a suspect or diagnosed HELLP syndrome
(p43.0) The first step is to evaluate the patient. The clinical maternal status, gestational age (ultrasound determined), presence of labour and cervical Bishop score should be determined. The laboratory examination must include complete blood cell count, in particular PLT count, coagulation parameters, AST, LDH and haptoglobin and urine examination. Blood pressure measurement, ultrasound examination and foetal assessment tests (Cardiotocography and Doppler examination) are important [5]. The next step is to stabilize the maternal clinical condition with intravenous fluids, antihypertensive drugs (e.g. labetalol or nifedipine) and magnesium sulphate to prevent convulsions [5,7,9,15]. It is of utmost importance to monitor closely maternal vital signs and fluid balance [5].

(p43.1) We agree with the proposal by Sibai [9] and others [7,133] who do not generally recommend immediate Caesarean section, but advocate vaginal or Caesarean delivery 24 to 48 hours after CS treatment for maximum maternal and foetal benefits. However, according to recent literature there is no strong evidence for beneficial effects following CS treatment in the HELLP syndrome. If the HELLP syndrome develops before 24 weeks' gestation, termination of pregnancy should be strongly considered [134].

## (s45) Timing and mode of delivery
(p45.0) We have not identified any randomized trial comparing maternal and neonatal outcome after vaginal delivery or Caesarean section for women with the HELLP syndrome. The indication of delivery, timing and method of delivery of the HELLP syndrome is more or less depending on experience and local traditions and there is no general agreement. A woman with a class 3 HELLP syndrome could await spontaneous onset of delivery at term [15]. Pregnant women with moderate (class 2), complete or severe (class 1) HELLP syndrome with completed 34 weeks' gestation should be delivered immediately after control of maternal hypertension [15]. The route of delivery should be selected on obstetric indications including cervical status, obstetric history, the maternal and the foetal condition. If the cervix is unfavourable for induction of labour, cervical ripening should be the first step [21].

(p45.1) Before 34 weeks' gestation, delivery should be chosen if the maternal condition cannot be controlled rapidly, if the maternal condition worsens or signs of intrauterine foetal distress develop. Maternal indications for immedi-ate delivery include blood pressure > 160/110 mmHg despite treatment with antihypertensive drugs, persisting or worsening clinical symptoms, deteriorating renal function, severe ascites, abruptio placentae, oliguria, pulmonary oedema or eclampsia [72]. In such cases most clinicians probably will prefer Caesarean section.

(p45.2) In pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation a full course of CS is advocated after maternal stabilization (particularly blood pressure and coagulation abnormalities) followed by induced delivery after 24 hours [7,9]. However, as mentioned, the support for this regimen is weak. Caesarean section should be performed in women who develop HELLP syndrome before 30 weeks' gestation [9,142] and in those in whom oligohydramnion and/or unfavourable Bishop score are diagnosed [9]. Regional anaesthesia is indicated for cases with PLT counts below 100·10 9 /L. However, epidural anaesthesia is contraindicated if the PLT count is below 75·10 9 /L [9]. Some authors also claim that regional anaesthesia is contraindicated if the platelet count is below 100·10 9 /L [143]. Platelet transfusion prior to Caesarean section has been suggested for class 1 HELLP syndrome, and for those with vaginal delivery and PLT count below 20 to 25·10 9 /L [21]. Antihypertensive drug is administered to keep blood pressure below 155/105 mmHg, and the woman should be monitored closely for at least 48 hours after delivery [10]. Most patients show evidence of resolution during this time.

(p45.3) We have not identified any randomized trial comparing maternal and neonatal outcome after vaginal delivery or Caesarean section for women with the HELLP syndrome. The indication of delivery, timing and method of delivery of the HELLP syndrome is more or less depending on experience and local traditions and there is no general agreement.

Pregnant women with moderate (class 2), complete or severe (class 1) HELLP syndrome with completed 34 weeks' gestation should be delivered immediately after control of maternal hypertension [15]. The route of delivery should be selected on obstetric indications including cervical status, obstetric history, the maternal and the foetal condition. If the cervix is unfavourable for induction of labour, cervical ripening should be the first step [21].

(p45.4) Before 34 weeks' gestation, delivery should be chosen if the maternal condition cannot be controlled rapidly, if the maternal condition worsens or signs of intrauterine foetal distress develop. Maternal indications for immedi-ate delivery include blood pressure > 160/110 mmHg despite treatment with antihypertensive drugs, persisting or worsening clinical symptoms, deteriorating renal function, severe ascites, abruptio placentae, oliguria, pulmonary oedema or eclampsia [72]. In such cases most clinicians probably will prefer Caesarean section.

(p45.5) In pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation a full course of CS is advocated after maternal stabilization (particularly blood pressure and coagulation abnormalities) followed by induced delivery after 24 hours [7,9]. However, as mentioned, the support for this regimen is weak. Caesarean section should be performed in women who develop HELLP syndrome before 30 weeks' gestation [9,142] and in those in whom oligohydramnion and/or unfavourable Bishop score are diagnosed [9].

Antihypertensive drug is administered to keep blood pressure below 155/105 mmHg, and the woman should be monitored closely for at least 48 hours after delivery [10]. Most patients show evidence of resolution during this time.
## (s46) Management of post-partum HELLP syndrome
(p46.0) In most women with a HELLP syndrome, the maternal PLT counts continue to decrease immediately post-partum with an increasing trend on the third day [6]. About 30% of the HELLP syndromes develop after birth; the majority within the first 48 hours. However, the time of onset might range from a few hours to 7 days after delivery [10]. In women with post-partum HELLP syndrome, risk of renal failure and pulmonary oedema is significantly increased compared to those with an antenatal onset [59,86]. Since early post-partum administration of highdose CS might accelerate recovery [128], its routine administration is highly advocated (10 mg of dexamethasone every 12 hours) [6,[144][145][146].

(p46.1) However, a randomized study showed that adjunctive use of intravenous dexamethasone for postpartum patients with severe preeclampsia did not reduce disease severity or duration [147]. Moreover, the benefit of dexamethasone in post-partum HELLP syndrome was not verified in a randomized placebo controlled trial on 105 women with postpartum HELLP syndrome. There was no difference in maternal morbidity, duration of hospital stay, need for rescue scheme or the use of blood products between the groups, nor was there any difference with respect to the pattern of PLT count, recovery, AST, LDH, haemoglobin or diuresis. These findings did not support the use of dexamethasone in the puerperium for recovery of women with HELLP [148].

(p46.2) Women with a HELLP syndrome who demonstrate progressive elevation of bilirubin or creatinine for more than 72 hours after delivery may benefit from plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma [149][150][151]. In the case of continuing haemolysis, persistent thrombocytopenia and hypoproteinaemia, post-partum erythrocyte and thrombocyte substitution, as well as albumin supplementation, are standard treatment regimens [5,21]. In a recent study of women with class 1 HELLP syndrome adding of platelet transfusion to standard CS administration did not increase the recovery rate [152]. Ertan et al. treated women with diuresis problems in the postpartum period with furosemide and applied prophylaxis with antithrombin or low-dose heparin for DIC [5]. A meta-analysis concluded that furosemide was not beneficial to prevent or treat acute renal failure in adults [153]. Too little fluid can exacerbate an already vasoconstricted intravascular volume and lead to renal injury in severe preeclampsia or in the HELLP syndrome. A bolus intravenous fluid of 250-500 ml is advocated if oliguria persists, and, if necessary, central monitoring of the patient [6].

(p46.3) Some patients with the HELLP syndrome, especially those with DIC, may demonstrate delayed resolution or even deterioration in the post-partum period [101]. Therefore, the use of heparin has been proposed for patients with preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome and DIC. A retrospective analysis of women with DIC in the post-partum period revealed that 6 of 9 developed post-partum bleeding including retroperitoneal haematoma. Treatment with heparin was discouraged for post-partum bleeding [84]. Thus, most authors oppose the routine use of heparin.

(p46.4) In most women with a HELLP syndrome, the maternal PLT counts continue to decrease immediately post-partum with an increasing trend on the third day [6]. About 30% of the HELLP syndromes develop after birth; the majority within the first 48 hours. However, the time of onset might range from a few hours to 7 days after delivery [10].

## (s47) Risk of recurrence and pre-conceptional counselling
(p47.0) Sibai has shown that oral contraceptives are safe in women with a prior HELLP syndrome [8]. Women with a history of the HELLP syndrome carry an increased risk of at least 20% (range 5-52%) that some form of gestational hypertension will recur in a subsequent gestation [7,11,101,142,154].

(p47.1) In a subsequent pregnancy, women with a history of HELLP syndrome at or before 28 weeks' gestation during the index pregnancy are at increased risk for several obstetric complications (preterm birth, pregnancy-induced hypertension and increased neonatal mortality) [154]. In patients with prior severe, early-onset preeclampsia thrombophilia screening has been suggested and should include search for protein S deficiency, activated protein C resistance (APC resistance), hyperhomocysteinemia and anti-phospholipid antibodies (both lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anti-cardiolipin) [155].

(p47.2) Sibai has shown that oral contraceptives are safe in women with a prior HELLP syndrome [8]. Women with a history of the HELLP syndrome carry an increased risk of at least 20% (range 5-52%) that some form of gestational hypertension will recur in a subsequent gestation [7,11,101,142,154].
