## (s2) Definitions of context
(p2.0) The context has captured attention of researchers in many fields such as philosophy, sociology, art, history and religion as well as information technology.Apart from all of these meanings that do not help much for understanding our targeted context, this work is only interested to the context related to ubiquitous computing environment.To be aware of the context components is the most important step in going towards building the pertinent models or developing applications in such ubiquitous system.The notion of context has appeared implicitly for the first time in ubiquitous computing area in 1993 by Weiser "all the information that should be taken into consideration for an adjustment".The formal definition of context which is widely accepted was given by Dey et al. [1]: "Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves".In 2015 [13] provided the latest definition of context "is any piece of information that can represent changes of the circumstance (either static or dynamic).Also, Chaari et al. 2005 defined the context as a set of external parameters to the application that can influence behavior by defining new views of its data and services [31].In this paper, we adopt this definition of context.
