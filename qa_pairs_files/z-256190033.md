## (s8) Effect of 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on Storage Temperature Recommendations
(p8.0) The growth regulator 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) is a vapour under physiological conditions and acts by inhibiting the binding of the hormone ethylene to its binding site [37,38]. Exposure to 1-MCP can temporarily render plant material insensitive to ethylene when applied at the parts-per-billion level. It is applied as a postharvest treatment but is sometimes applied on trees pre-harvest. The 1-MCP can reduce several serious storage disorders that cause fruit loss, such as senescent breakdown and superficial scald, but the incidence of others, including carbon dioxide injury and flesh browning, can be increased by 1-MCP [38]. Since apple fruit in storage can respond well to 1-MCP treatment, it is recommended for use on most apple cultivars, whereas recommendations for its use in stored pears has been more limited to a few selected cultivars.
