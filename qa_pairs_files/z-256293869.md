## (s2) Role of laccase in nature
(p2.0) Due to the large amounts of laccase produced by lignin degrading (wood rotting) fungi, it has been presumed that the main role of laccase in nature is the polymerization and degradation of lignin [63,86]. Laccase mediated degradation of lignin starts with the loss of an electron from the phenolic hydroxyl groups of lignin to produce phenoxy radicals which spontaneously re-organizes to aid either α-carbon oxidation or C α -C β bond cleavage of alkyl side chains of the polymer to produce low molecular weight and/or polymeric products due to polymerizing activity of the enzyme [30,87]. Fungal laccases are argued to be involved in the regeneration of tobacco protoplasts [88], lignification of cell walls [6,89], morphogenesis of rhizomorphs [37], sclerotization and melanogenesis processes in insects [90,91,92], fungal virulence, sporulation and plant pathogenesis [49,93].
## (s5) Waste water treatment
(p5.0) Enzymatic bioconversion technologies have attracted growing interests in the field of wastewater treatment due to their ability to eliminate toxic compounds at mild conditions with less biodegradation by-products [155]. The use of enzymes for wastewater treatment is advantageous due to the substrate specificity of enzymes, reduced susceptibility of the biocatalyst to shock-loading effects, high rates of reaction, efficient use of oxidants, and effective treatment at low substrate concentrations [156]. The removal of phenolic compounds from industrial effluents and the environment is of great importance as these compounds are highly toxic to aquatic organisms and account for the biggest percentage of organic pollutants [157,158]. Phenolic compounds form a significant percentage of industrial effluents due to their wide use in many industrial processes such as manufacture of plastics and resins, wood preservation, petroleum refining, paper, dyes, pesticides, textiles, drugs, and anti-oxidants [159,160,161]. Majority of these compounds are not removed from the liquid portion by waste water treatment plants and they are transferred into the sludge. More so, they are not degraded by the active sludge in treatment plants hence end up in the environment via waste water effluents and in bio-solids through agricultural applications [162,163]. These compounds have been related to health problems and environmental pollution due to their inherent toxicity [164]. Consequently, the need to degrade or transform these compounds into degradable or non-toxic ones using enzymes is of great interest [165].
## (s7) Dye degradation
(p7.0) Synthetic dyes have gained popularity in the textile, paper, cosmetics, leather dyeing, colour photography, pharmaceutical, and food industries due to their low cost, ease of synthesis, and colour variety [111,162]. They are classified according to chemical structure of the chromophore (molecule responsible for their colour) groups as azo, anthraquinone, heterocyclic, triphenylmethane, xanthene, acridine, or phthalocyanine [229]. Azo dyes constitute of the largest percentage accounting for 60-70% of all the dyes in the textile industry [230,231] followed by the anthraquinones [232]. Since the dyes are designed to meet various colouring requirements, they have very stable chemical structures that are difficult to degrade hence causing serious environmental pollution [198,233]. They are obstinate to microbial degradation and conventional treatment methods, affecting water transparency and gas solubility leading to reduced dissolved oxygen and may be transformed to carcinogenic compounds under anaerobic conditions [234,235,236].

(p7.1) The textile and dye industry is the major source of water pollution with its effluents containing 10-30% of the initial dyestuffs that are difficult to treat due to their non-biodegradable nature and complex molecular structures [168,237]. The most crucial step in dye degradation by laccases is the cleavage of their chromophores which renders the dye fragments more susceptible to biodegradation by other less specialized biocatalysts [111,234]. The chemical structure and type of substitute group such as azo, nitro, and sulfo groups of the reactive dye molecule determine the dye decolourisation rate [235,237]. Biological treatment processes of effluent dye are inefficient because the dyes are highly resistant to biological oxidation and they poorly adsorb on activated sludge [66]. Decolourisation using physical or chemical methods such as adsorption, precipitation, chemical degradation, and photo-degradation has financial and methodological disadvantages, is time-consuming, and mostly ineffective [238]. With the stringent regulations and restrictions established for effluent discharge into the ecosystem, a number of studies have focused on microorganisms, which are able to decolourise and biodegrade these dyes [239,240,241,242]. Enzymatic treatment of dye effluents has gained attention because of the mild reaction conditions involved without generating any secondary pollution like toxic sludge [243,244].
## (s10) Biofuel cells
(p10.0) The fascinating character of direct four electron reduction of oxygen to water by laccase at high electrode potentials has promoted its application in the cathode compartment of biofuel cells [285,286,287]. Compared to metallic catalysts, laccase has unique advantages such as catalytic efficiency at high redox potentials, clean oxygen reduction without the formation of hydrogen peroxide intermediate, and relatively low cost [65,288]. The effective immobilization of laccase and its mediator on electrodes as required is the key step in construction of biofuel cells [289]. Efficient electron transfer between the active site of laccase and the electrode and efficient supply of laccase with oxygen are the prerequisites for high performance of the biofuel cell [285].

(p10.1) Biofuel cells using enzymes as biocatalysts are emerging as the new non-polluting and renewable electricity sources that respect the standards of "green energy'' [124]. Enzymatic biofuel cells take advantage of selectivity of enzymes to oxidize specific substrate and reduce oxygen in order to obtain power output from physiological fluids [290,291]. Due to the selectivity of enzymes, separation of electrodes in an enzymatic biofuel cell is not required hence the anode and cathode can all be immersed in one membrane containing the fuel and oxidant. This allows for fabrication of miniaturized fuel cells as small as the micrometre scale [292]. For example, Barrière et al. [293], used an osmium-based redox polymer for laccase-mediated reduction of oxygen coupled to glucose oxidase-mediated oxidation of glucose to form a membrane-less biofuel cell. At the biocathode, laccase is wired on to an electrode surface to achieve oxygen reduction through either mediated electron transfer (MET) or direct electron transfer (DET) [290]. MET involves integration of redox mediators that shuttle electrons between the active sites of the enzyme and the electrode while DET allows electron transfer between laccase and electrode via fast tunnelling in absence of a mediator [45,294].

(p10.2) In MET, the mediator (e.g. Dopamine [295] and ABTS [291]) is either free in solution or immobilized with the enzyme on the electrode [296]. For example, laccase was immobilized on three-dimensional graphene networks (3D-GNs) functionalized with dopamine and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetra carboxylic acid (PTCA) which acted as mediator and spacer respectively on the GCE. The modified electrode was used as a cathode in a glucose/O 2 biofuel cell with a maximum power density of 112 μWcm-2 and a short circuit current of 0.96 mAcm-2 [289]. Barrière et al. [297], fabricated a biofuel cell consisting of a glucose-oxidase based anode and laccase based cathode. The enzymes were immobilized on graphite electrodes using osmium-based redox polymers as mediators and the biofuel cell gave maximum power density of 16 μW/cm 2 at a cell voltage of 0.25 V. The redox mediators should have excellent reversible electron transfer properties, potentials close to the redox potential of the enzyme active site, and ensure sufficient driving force to optimize bioelectrocatalytic activity [285]. Even though utilization of redox mediators results in higher current densities, MET-based systems often experience mediator leaching, oxygen sensitivity of the mediators, and loss of open-circuit potential [45,298]. As a result DET-based systems are preferred for high power biofuel cells that can be used in portable power applications [298].

(p10.3) In DET-based cell, the reduction of oxygen relies on the close proximity (within 1.5 nm) of the enzyme active site and the electrode surface [45,299]. Electron transfer occurs during catalytic transformation of the substrate and its kinetics is determined by the orientation of the enzyme on the electrode surface, potential difference, and distance between the enzyme active site and the electrode surface [298,300]. DET is optimized when active site of the enzyme molecules are most exposed to the electrode surface and can be improved by modifying the electrode surface with conductive nano-elements like carbon nanotubes and metal and metal oxide nanoparticles [301]. Electrode surfaces modified with nanoparticles such as nano-Gold (nAu) provide a microenvironment similar to that of redox-enzymes in native systems and allow freedom in enzyme orientation since electron transfer proceeds through the conducting tunnels of the nanoparticles [302]. DET is preferred because the biofuel cell voltage is maximized since enzymatic catalysis is performed at apparent redox potentials of the enzymes at the cathode and anode. Also the absence of redox mediators simplifies the fabrication process of the cell, increases cell stability, and minimizes toxicity issues that could arise from the leaching of mediators [285,303]. Gellet et al. [298], used Rhus vernificera laccase to develop an air-breathing biocathode that employed DET for application in a proton exchange membrane hydrogen/air fuel cell and a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with an anion exchange membrane. The biocatalyst provided high operational current density of 50 mA/cm 2 , maximum power density of 8.5 mW/cm 2 , and a lifetime of 290 h in a 40% methanol DMFC. A stable current for 350 discontinuous h when operated for 8 h daily was achieved in the hydrogen/air fuel cell.
## (s11) Biosensors
(p11.0) The release of phenolic compounds by a large number of industries necessitates their detection and quantification in the environment. Since these compounds are toxic and persistent in the environment, their quantification is important when evaluating the total toxicity of an environmental sample [304,305]. Phenolic compounds are also present in fruits and vegetables and their products such as juices and wines. The polyphenol content in juices and wines affects their quality in terms of colour, flavour, stability, and aging behaviour hence the need for their quantification [306]. Most analytical methods used to qualitatively and quantitatively determine polyphenols are expensive, time consuming, and require several operation steps, costly reagents, and separation steps with large amounts of environmentally unfriendly effluents [304,307].

(p11.1) Biosensors modified with laccase have been developed for detection of laccase electron donors (phenolic compounds) [116,308] and monitoring oxygen and laccase inhibitors [24]. The construction of laccase-based biosensors is relatively simple as it doesn't require hydrogen peroxide as a co-substrate or any other co-factor for its catalytic activity [164,309]. The biosensors are based on the principle of reduction of oxygen by laccase to water hence monitor the consumption of oxygen during oxidation of the analyte [43,308]. The response time is dependent on the enzymatic reaction kinetics, the diffusion and solubility of the substrates at the electrode, and the electrochemical reduction of the oxidized mediator at the electrode surface [310].
## (s12) Immobilization of laccase
(p12.0) Despite the many advantages associated with using laccase in industrial settings, limitations such as enzyme instability in varying environmental conditions like pH, ionic strength and temperature, proteolysis, inactivation by inhibitors, and the difficulty to separate the enzyme from the reaction mixture limits its further use in industrial applications [215,359,360]. Moreover the high cost of continually discarding the enzyme with treated solutions may be particularly prohibitive [361]. For the potential use of laccase to be increased and its reuse and stability in harsh conditions to be achieved, immobilization is necessary [362,363]. It is the key to optimizing the operational performance of laccase in industrial processes and especially in non-aqueous media [364]. Immobilized enzymes mimic their natural mode in living cells where they are mostly attached to organelle structures, membranes, and cellular cytoskeleton there by improving their stability [115,365]. The extent of stabilization depends on the enzyme structure, the immobilization methods, and type of support [366].
## (s13) Immobilization techniques
(p13.0) There are five major techniques employed in immobilization of laccase namely, physical adsorption, entrapment, encapsulation, covalent bonding, and crosslinking ( Figure 6). The techniques are classified as physical (entrapment, encapsulation and adsorption) and chemical (covalent and crosslinking). These methods vary in cost and ease of preparation, stability, catalytic efficiency, and physical properties of the resultant biocatalyst [401]. The different immobilization techniques with their advantages and disadvantages as well as the type and strength of interaction between enzyme and support for each technique have been summarized in Table 2.

(p13.1) Immobilization with physical techniques involves relatively weak and reversible interactions with the support [365]. They offer less disturbance to the enzyme structure and retain enzyme properties to those in solution [19]. However, the weak interactions between the enzyme and support cause enzyme leaching which results in activity loss and contamination of the surrounding media [212]. And since there is no control over the parking density of the enzyme on the support, the activity of the biocatalyst can be reduced due to overcrowding of the enzyme [365].
## (s15) Encapsulation
(p15.0) Microencapsulation is a form of entrapment where the enzyme is entrapped in the core of micron-sized spheres made from semipermeable hollow (microcapsule) or solid (microbeads) material [40,407]. The core of the capsule provides an aqueous environment which support enzymatic activity and the capsule (wall) itself serves as a container through which only the substrates can diffuse [322]. This method ensures the enzyme is fully embed in the supports and prevents interference that can arise from interaction of the enzyme with the external interface [408]. Microencapsulation is especially favourable in electrodes as high amounts of enzyme can be immobilized and the polymer wall properties can be tuned to prevent diffusion of inhibiting molecules in the capsule [322]. This method is economical and allows encapsulation of large volumes of the enzyme but is limited by diffusion limitation of the substrate across the membrane and accumulation or repulsion of the substrate by the membrane [200,322].

(p15.1) Approaches such as layer by layer (LbL) and self-assembly using polyelectrolytes have been used to encapsulate laccase [322]. The LbL technique involves deposition of enzymes between films in multilayer system through alternating layer by layer deposition of support and enzyme. The advantages with this technique are that a variety of materials can be incorporated into the layers with controlled thickness of the biocatalyst [85,224]. The enzyme activity is retained without compromising its stability and it can easily be reloaded when necessary [409]. Laccase has been encapsulated in materials like nanocellulose [200], thin silicate films [69], graphene oxide-laccase nanoassemblies [224], self-assembled monolayer (SAM) -3-mercaptopropionic acid [101], and sol-gels [109,164].
## (s16) Adsorption
(p16.0) The adsorption technique involves attachment of laccase on the exterior surface of a support through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic forces, or hydrophobic effects and solely depends on the isoelectric points of the enzyme and support [200,405]. For electrostatic attraction, the charge on the surface of the carrier should be opposite to the charge of the enzyme and these are determined by the isoelectric point of the enzyme, pH of the buffer, and ionic strength of the medium [383,393]. Because this technique is associated with low linking energy between enzyme and support, the enzyme is susceptible to leaching during washings and changing pH, temperature, and ionic strength [391]. The active site of the support may be blocked by the support greatly reducing the enzyme activity [410].

(p16.1) To minimize these limitations, metal-chelated and bioaffinity adsorption have gained popularity in immobilizing laccase. Metal chelated adsorption is based on the covalent conjugation of metal ions and His or Cys residues at the surface of the enzyme [411]. This approach is preferred because of its simple operation, stability, reversibility, and oriented enzyme immobilization for spatial accessibility into the substrate [196,213]. For example, when laccase was immobilized on Cu 2+ chelated zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) and manganese oxide nanoparticles (MnO 2 NPs) through metal affinity adsorption, the immobilized laccase demonstrated almost double the catalytic activity towards degradation of alizarin red S dye (95% for lac-ZnONPs and 85% for lac-MnO 2 NPs) than the free  [412]. Wang et al. [397], achieved 92.5% activity and a retained activity of 86.6% after 10 successive batch oxidation of catechol when T. versicolor laccase was immobilized on Cu 2+ chelated magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles via metal affinity adsorption at pH 3.0. Wang et al. [413], immobilized laccase on amidoxime polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membranes (AOPAN) chelated with four metal ions (Fe 3+ , Cu 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cd 2+ ) individually and as a mixture of the metal ions. The membrane chelated with four mixed metal ions showed the best properties followed by the individual metal ions in the order Fe-AOPAN-Lac > Cu-AOPAN-Lac > Ni-AOPAN-Lac > Cd-AOPAN-Lac. The stability of the immobilized enzyme depended on the size and polarizability of the metal ions. The saturation of laccase His structures with metal ions stabilized the enzyme's three-dimensional structure through special covalent coordinate bonds which minimized enzyme distortion and desorption [184,414]. Bioaffinity based adsorption utilizing the affinity of laccase carbon moieties to the support surface has been explored. For example, Li et al. [415], exploited the specific affinity of Concanavalin A (Con A) for glycosyl to immobilize horseradish peroxidase and laccase on the surface of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) through self-assembly. The SWNTs were incubated with n-dodecyl β-D maltoside (DM) to form SWNTs-DM complex which was activated with Con A for enzyme immobilization. DM and the enzymes were bound on Con A step by step via the affinity force to form a sandwich structure hence indirectly immobilizing the enzymes on the SWNTs. This approach allows enzymes to be directly adsorbed from crude homogenates which bypasses the cost of enzyme purification with fewer immobilization residues generated [391].
## (s18) Crosslinking of enzymes
(p18.0) The main challenge with carrier bound immobilization is the dilution of catalytic activity as the biggest portion of the biocatalyst is occupied by the support leading to lower volumetric and space-time yields hence lower catalyst productivity [147,436]. Moreover high enzyme loading on the support often results in loss of activity and instability towards leaching in aqueous media [437]. Also cross linking reactions between enzyme and support are difficult to control which often leads to structural denaturation of the enzyme molecules [404]. To minimize these effects, self-immobilization techniques where laccase is incubated with crosslinking agents have been explored [81,436]. And since the molecular weight of the crosslinking agent is negligible in relation that of the enzyme, the biocatalyst can essentially comprise of 100 % active enzyme [147]. Therefore, the immobilized enzyme exhibits operational stability and reusability with efficiencies close to those of the free enzyme [103,438].
## (s20) Supports used for laccase immobilization
(p20.0) A suitable support material for enzyme immobilization should be compatible with the enzyme, inert in process solutions, and facilitate substrate diffusion to accomplish the biocatalytic reaction [85,376]. Therefore factors such as volume, porosity, shape, surface properties, stability in given reaction conditions, and cost are considered when selecting a support for immobilization [51]. For inert supports, their surfaces are modified to offer functional groups for protein binding [454]. Various materials have been explored over the years as supports for laccase enzyme ( Figure 6, Table S2) [455]. The supports are classified into porous and nonporous supports (based on the structure) or organic and inorganic supports (based on their composition). Porous supports offer high enzyme loading with diffusion limitations especially for large molecular weight substrates [373] while nonporous supports have low diffusion limitations but suffer from low surface areas for enzyme immobilization [424]. Different materials have been explored as supports for immobilization of laccase enzyme (Table S2) and have been extensively discussed in this section.
## (s22) Glass/silica
(p22.0) Silica has been widely used as a choice for immobilization because it is neutral, non-toxic, and occurs in the natural environment [188]. It is endowed with properties such as tunable particle size, porosity, surface area, transparency, chemical stability, and convenient preparation [22]. Various forms of silica including activated glass beads [249], perlite (amorphous volcanic glass) [423], porous silica beads [121,458], silica gel [197,365], controlled porosity glass/silica beads [26,147,210], and ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) such as SBA-15 [74,459] have been used for laccase immobilization.

(p22.1) In the past decade, much work has been undertaken in the synthesis of mesoporous silicates and in the immobilization of enzymes onto these supports. Mesoporous silica materials have attracted attention as catalyst supports due to their large specific surface area, mechanical stability, water insolubility, biocompatibility, adjustable pore size, highly ordered structure, and resistance to microbial attack [397,406,444]. More so, their surfaces can be chemically modified with various functional groups to enable electrostatic attraction between the support and enzyme while offering thermal and chemical stability [360,365]. For example, functionalized ionic liquid supports were grafted onto mesoporous silica molecular sieves to obtain modified mesoporous silica with imidazole functional group for laccase adsorption [460]. Enzymes can be immobilized in mesoporous materials by different methods: adsorption, covalent attachment, or encapsulation.

(p22.2) The most important aspect when adsorbing enzymes on ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) materials is the pore opening diameter. Enzymes larger that the pore diameter cannot fit through the pore openings while pore opening way larger than the enzyme leads to enzyme leaching [461]. Encapsulation of enzymes in these supports renders them more mechanically robust and stable over time and covalent bonding is not required hence the native properties of the enzyme are maintained [305,346]. Adsorption of the enzyme is suitable when the pore size is close to the enzyme dimension while covalent attachment is advisable when the pore sizes are far larger than the enzyme dimensions [462]. For large pore sizes, the silanol groups on the surface of the OMS can be activated with functional groups to strengthen the van der Waals interactions or serve as anchoring points for covalent immobilization [405,461]. For example, Yang et al. [222], introduced amino functional groups in the pores of mesoporous silica using APTES and then crosslinked the activated carrier with GA prior to reaction with laccase solution.
## (s23) Aluminium oxide
(p23.0) Aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) is one of the metal oxides characterized with well-developed porous structures of varying pore diameters (ranging from 2 to 10 nm). It demonstrates high crystallinity, porosity, thermal, and mechanical stability [463]. Aluminium oxide in the form of pellets [234], mesoporous [463], nanoporous [464], and zeolite [198,465] has been explored for laccase immobilization due to its high surface area, porosity, chemical, and mechanical stability. For example, Bruera et al. [464], adsorbed laccase on nanoporous aluminum oxide for treatment of black liquor. An immobilization yield of 18.1% was achieved and the biocatalyst retained 95.6% of its initial activity after consecutive runs and a 40 fold increase in removal of black liquor as compared to the free enzyme. Wehaidy et al. [466], immobilized laccase on nanoporus zeolite-x with an immobilization efficiency of 83% and 100% residual activity after 7 reuse cycles. When laccase was adsorbed in mesoporous aluminium oxide, the enzyme retained 65% and 60% of its initial activity after 30 days of storage and 10 reaction cycles respectively [463].
## (s27) Carbon
(p27.0) Carbon has been explored as an enzyme support material due to is good mechanical strength, availability, easy modification with different functional groups such as carboxyl, amino, and phenolic-OH for enzyme coupling, and is already used in food and waste treatment industries [480]. Carboxylic functional groups can be easily formed on the surface of carbonaceous materials which provide ideal anchoring points for physical attachment and covalent bonding of enzymes on their surface [212]. Carbon can be obtained from wastes from the food industry hence provides cheaper alternatives for enzyme immobilization [150]. Various forms of carbon including graphite and its oxide [87], copper-containing ordered mesoporous carbon (Cu-OMC) [307], carbon fibers [481], magnetic bimodal mesoporous carbon [162], activated carbon [454,480], and carbon nanotubes [482,483,484] have been used for laccase immobilization.

(p27.1) Carbon nanomaterials such as graphene oxide, SWNT, and MWNT are promising enzyme supports because of their chemical inertness, biocompatibility, and electrical conductivity [225,381]. Graphene is a two dimensional monoatomic thick carbon material with high electrical and thermal conductivity, chemical stability, superior mechanical properties, nontoxicity, and high transparency usually derived from ordinary graphite [485,486]. The two dimensional plate like structure of graphene offers a large surface area accompanied with incredible flexibility and great mechanical properties [289,487]. Graphene offers low energy dynamics of electrons with atomic thickness, high carrier mobilities, abundant oxygen-containing functionalities, and water solubility making it an attractive support for laccase immobilization [224,354]. The surfaces of graphene can be modified or derivatized to obtain congeners such as graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide nanomaterials [485] and hydrogels or xerogels [488]. The use of graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide to immobilize laccase have provided simple and less aggressive techniques [340,377]. Due to its high hydrophilicity and tendency to agglomerate, graphene and its derivatives are combined with other nanomaterials such as Fe 3 O 4 [382,489,490], CuFe 2 O4 [486], zeolite [491], PANI [338], MWNTs [492,493], cellulose [494], zirconium-metal organic framework (Zr-MOF) [214], and Sb 2 O5 [337] to aid its recovery. For example, Palanisamy et al. [339], adsorbed laccase on a screen printed electrode modified with graphene-cellulose microfiber composite for detection of catechol. A sensitive and selective biosensor was developed with a limit of detection of 85 nM, response time of 2s, linear response range up to 209.7 μM, and sensitivity of 0.932 μAμM− 1 cm− 2. Xu et al. [495], adsorbed laccase on a membrane developed by depositing GO nanosheets by layer-by-layer approach on a polyethersulfone support to obtain a biocatalyst with excellent stability towards temperature and pH over a long time.

(p27.2) Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanowires based on tubular graphene layers of varying diameter, length, and chirality consisting of one (SWNT) or more (MWNT) nanotubes. They offer high adsorption capacity, large specific surface area, high enzyme loading, high conductivity, and they can easily be functionalized to obtain specific properties [496,497]. CNTs easily bind to the enzyme noncovalently through hydrophobic interactions, formation of π-π stacks between enzyme residues and their surfaces, ampiphilic binding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding between the enzyme amino groups and oxidized groups on their surfaces [285,498]. For example, laccase was noncovalently immobilized on SWNT using a molecular tether (1-pyrene butanoic acid, succinimidylester) that formed an amide bond with the amine groups on laccase surface and coordinated to the SWNTs through π-π stacking with pyrene [499].

(p27.3) The unique tubular geometrical structure, superb electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity, and superior tensile strength have made MWNT excellent enzyme carriers [176,381]. MWNT can also be oxidized to produce carboxylated MWNT which have abundant oxygen-containing surface functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxylic, and epoxy groups to enable the facile binding of various molecules including proteins, enzymes, DNA, surfactants, and metals, etc., with or without coupling agents [482]. They have been utilized as electron mediators to facilitate electron transfer between electrodes and enzymes due to their high electrical conductivity [332,344]. However, immobilization of laccase on MWNT has been reported to have limited impact on the thermal stability of the enzyme [498]. MWNT have been combined with other compounds such as cellulose nitrate, agarose, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [381], polynorbornene-pyrene [500], electrospun fibers [501], chitosan [334], mesoporous silica [502], poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) [335], nanoparticles such as Ni [317], Au [335], and anthraquinone moieties [290,503] to increase their stability through reduced agglomeration for continuous or multibatch processes. For example, laccase was adsorbed on a MWNT/Ag-nZnO composite by dropcasting laccase on a screen printed electrode modified with MWNTs that are functionalized with silver doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (nAg-ZnO) for detection of bisphenol A [331].
## (s29) Polymers
(p29.0) Polymer based carriers have attracted attention in enzyme immobilization because of their easy surface modification where various reactive groups can be anchored on the matrix and their morphology can be tuned during the polymerization step [379]. Properties such as surface area, functional group density, and porosity can be tailored to meet the specific needs for immobilization [389]. A variety of polymeric support materials including natural (chitin, chitosan, agarose, and cellulose derivatives) and synthetic (nylon, polysiloxane, polyvinyl alcohol [431], poly (glycidyl methacrylate), and polyacrylic polymers) have been prepared in various geometric forms and used for the immobilization of laccase. Biological or natural polymers have demonstrated advantages such as low cost, nontoxicity, and biocompatibility with enzymes through interaction with their functional groups [122]. However these supports suffer from low mechanical strength and are liable to microbial degradation necessitating the need for synthetic polymers [245]. The various polymers that have been utilized in laccase immobilization are discussed in this section.
## (s31) Cellulose.
(p31.0) Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer and is nontoxic, biodegradable, hydrophilic, and biocompatible making it an excellent support for enzyme immobilization [313]. In addition, its derivatives such as cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, and carboxymethyl cellulose also offer excellent biocompatibility [168,532]. Cellulose usually varies in morphology, size, crystallinity, and surface functional groups depending on the source of agricultural waste used during synthesis [247]. Laccase has been immobilized on cellulose based carriers such as cellulose acetate [313], nanocrystals [533], cellulose based Granocel carriers [8,379] and solubilized cellulose, and PAMAM films [534]. For example, Ghodake et al. [211], extracted α-cellulose fibers form waste-paper biomass and super-magnetized them with Fe 3 O 4 followed by grafting with CS and thiol groups for laccase immobilization.

(p31.1) Even though most cellulose has been isolated from plants, several bacteria from the genus Gluconacetobacter have recently been reported to produce a unique form of cellulose commonly called bacterial cellulose (BC) [535]. BC has demonstrated excellent characteristics such as tridimensional and fibrillar nanostructure, high water absorption capacity, and excellent mechanical strength which differ from plant cellulose [535,536]. Since BC is nontoxic, biocompatible, bioavailable, non-carcinogenic, and easily biodegradable, it has been explored in enzyme immobilization for biomedical applications such as wound dressing, burn treatment, and tissue regeneration [284]. Due to its fibrillar nanostructure, large surface area, and high porosity, BC is expected to easily entrap enzymes and achieve high enzyme immobilization yield and efficiency [536]. For example, Li et al. [324], hybridized BC nanofibers by depositing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Laccase was then adsorbed to the hybrid followed by addition of Nafion. The biocatalyst was used as a biosensor for detection hydroquinone with a low detection limit of 5.71 nM and a wide linear range of 30-100 nM. Laccase adsorbed on BC aerogels for degradation organic dyes degraded 94.5% and 85.2% of reactive red and 2,4 dichlorophenol respectively within 4 h and retained 76% activity after 5 reuse cycles [537].

(p31.2) Enzyme immobilization on cellulose supports is through simple physical adsorption or weak inter ionic interactions between the enzyme and activated hydroxyl groups on cellulose [534]. Drozd et al. [538], reported that exposing BC to a rotating magnetic field prior to laccase immobilization improved the thermal stability of the biocatalyst by 10 • C and activity retention after 8 cycle by 15%.

(p31.3) 7.2.3.1.3. Agarose/sepharose. Agarose based gels are used as matrices for enzyme immobilization due to their biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface that can be activated for covalent bonding with enzymes [72,539]. For example, Brugnari et al. [540], immobilized P. ostreatus laccase on MANAE-agarose for degradation of bisphenol A. An immobilization yield of 100% and 138% activity of the immobilized enzyme compared to its free form were obtained. The biocatalyst also demonstrated thermal and storage stability, longer half-life and retained 90% of its initial activity after 15 reuse cycles. Laccase immobilized in sepharose-CL-6B glass beads has also showed great stability in organic solvents such as hexane, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane [539]. Agarose activated with functional groups such as hydroquinone and β-benzoquinone [10], glyoxal [541], thiolsulfinate [542], aldehydes [165], and anti-laccase antibodies [253] have been explored for laccase immobilization.
## (s34) Eupergit.
(p34.0) Eupergit is an epoxy activated polymer that binds to enzymes via epoxide groups [172,550]. Its oxirane groups function as active components for covalent binding of ligands containing amino, mercapto, or hydroxyl groups [48,551]. Due to their hydrophilicity, wide pore distribution, and good hydrodynamic properties, they offer a simple coupling procedure to the enzymes [552]. Hublik and Schinner [48] immobilized P. ostreatus laccase on Eupergit C. benzoate and used the bioconjugate for continuous elimination of 2, 6-dimethoxyphenol in a packed bed reactor. No substrate was detected in the filtrate and the bioconjugate showed increased activity and great stability with a 2% registered loss after 10 days. When laccase-eupergit bioconjugate was used in a fluidized bed reactor for the removal of estrogens, prolonged enzyme stability of over 16 days was attained [553].
## (s37) Mixtures and hybrids of polymers.
(p37.0) Because polymers suffer from low mechanical strength and ease of microbial attack, new techniques have been developed to enhance their mechanical properties such as crosslinking, mixing the polymers with other polymers or inorganic materials [198], graft copolymerization, and use of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs). Supports of polymers mixed with other materials such as Alginate-carbon beads [571], polyacrylamide-alginate cryogels [572], alginate-gelatin Mixed Gel [162], polyvinyl-alginate-silicon dioxide matrix [130], poly (amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimers [534], gelatin blended with polyethylene glycol [544], butyl acrylate, and ethylene glycol [390] have been reported for laccase immobilization with improved immobilization yields and efficiencies compared to the supports from polymers alone. Graft copolymerization is the addition of functional groups to a polymer through covalent bonding of monomers onto the polymer chain to improve its mechanical properties and stability [521,546]. The properties of the resultant copolymer combine properties of the prepolymer and the grafted molecule and these properties can be regulated by varying the concentrations of initiators, crosslinkers, and the prepolymer [573]. IPNs are combinations of two polymers in network form in which one polymer is synthesized and/or crosslinked in the presence of another [245,402].

(p37.1) Smart polymers have also been utilized to immobilize laccase with the hope of retaining its activity over a wider range of pH, temperature, and ionic strength [365]. For example, Klis et al. [321], covalently immobilized laccase on poly (N-isopropyacrylamide) gel attached to a dimethoxyloxyvinylsilnae silanized ITO electrode, and determined its redox and catalytic properties at varying sizes of the gel matrix. It was observed that the catalytic efficiency decreased with shrinking gel size but the enzyme structure remained unchanged.

(p37.2) Crosslinking of polymers to form gels (hydrogels and cryogels) for entrapment of laccase has also been reported as the gels present improved resistance to thermal and chemical inactivation, remarkable storage, and operational stability [573]. For example, laccase was covalently immobilized on a composite of methyl methacrylate (MMA)/butyl acrylate (BA) copolymer latexes, and rGO hydrogels. The composite hydrogels were synthesized by self-assembly of graphene oxide nanoparticles in the polymer latex matrix where the polymer nanoparticles were adsorbed on the rGO surface [487]. Hydrogels are soft and highly hydrated polymeric networks synthesized via covalent or ionic crosslinking of monomers with or without metal ions [574]. Entrapment of enzymes in hydrogel leads to secondary interactions between the enzyme and the polymeric matrix which may cause a shift of the enzyme maximum activity to a higher pH than the free enzyme [402]. And since the retention and expression of enzyme activity are closely related to the particle size, porosity, and polarity of the supporting matrix, the structure of the hydrogel needs to be optimized for maximum enzyme activity [573]. Electron-beam grafting techniques have also been explored to form gels in the absence of initiators and crosslinkers. For example, Jahangiri et al. [575], used electron beam irradiation on a mixture of poly (vinylidene fluoride) membranes and laccase to form membrane-laccase bioreactors and on a mixture of macroporous polymeric gels, laccase, syringaldehyde, and ABTS to form cryogel bioreactors for degradation of bisphenol A. By using high-energy electron radiation cryogels can be synthesized without additional initiators or cross-linkers within 10 min (excl. freezing time) as larger bulk materials allowing furthermore the simultaneous incorporation of macromolecules in a one-step process.
## (s38) Electrodes
(p38.0) Laccase has been immobilized on electrodes for application in biosensors and biofuel cells [3]. An immobilization strategy that maximizes coverage of enzyme on the electrode surface with high operational stability and ensures maximum electron transfer between the redox sites of the enzyme and the electrode surface and minimum loss of enzyme from the electrode surface through leaching are the most important aspects considered during immobilization [301,344]. Therefore the development of biosensors based on enzyme modified electrode surfaces in such a way that the enzymes' full activity and stability are retained has become an important aspect in various fields ranging from environmental analysis to clinical diagnosis [343,481]. Immobilization of enzymes on electrode surfaces should ensure that the redox centres of the enzyme are as close as possible to the electrode surface to allow rapid electron transfer between the enzyme and electrode [101,322]. The immobilization method is also an important factor as it should provide proper orientation of the enzyme efficient electronic contact with the electrode [576].
## (s39) Metal organic frameworks (MOFs)
(p39.0) MOFs are mesoporous structures consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands [365]. They are synthesized by diffusion of a combination of metals and organic skeletons [586]. They are associated with ultrahigh and tuneable porosities, large surface areas, multiple functional sites, structural flexibility, chemical, and thermal stability [587]. More so, their organic bridging ligand can be synthetically modified to introduce desired functional groups to the framework [588,589]. MOFs have been synthesized with various metals and metal oxides such as copper [586], iron [590], zirconium [588], and zeolite [587] for laccase immobilization. Ladole et al. [591], reported synthesis of magnetic MOFs (MMOFs) consisting of peroxidase and magnetic nanoparticles. Laccase was embedded in the MMOFs to form a biocatalyst of 100 nm average diameter, high thermal stability, and recyclability of 89% residual activity after 10 cycles, and storage stability of 100% residual activity after 30 days. Entrapment of laccase in nanocrystalline NH 2 -MIL-53 (Al) demonstrated high enzyme loading, permanent retention of the enzyme and stability. The bioconjugate was used for the removal of bisphenol A from water and it achieved 100% removal after 3 min [220]. Immobilization of laccase on MOFs has been extensively reviewed elsewhere [592].
## (s41) Co-immobilization of laccase with other enzymes and substrates
(p41.0) Simultaneous immobilization of laccase with another or more enzymes has been explored to enhance the sensitivity and extend the substrate spectrum of biosensors [604,605]. For example, Montereali et al. [606], reported a lower limit of detection and a wider range of phenolic compounds detected when a biosensor of co-immobilized laccase and tyrosinase on a ferrocene modified graphite screen printed electrode was used as compared to the individual laccase and tyrosinase biosensors. Moeder et al. [403], co-immobilized laccase and horse radish peroxidase (HRP) on a microporous polypropylene hollow fibre membrane by physical entrapment and the bioconjugate was used in the degradation of 4-ethylphenol, 3,4-dimethylphenol, tetralol, and 4-hydroxybiphenyl from water samples. Quan et al. [607], co-immobilized tyrosinase and laccase on a platinum electrode for use as a biosensor for PPD and p-chlorophenol. The sensitivity of the bi-enzyme sensor increased by 70% for PPD compared to only when the laccase sensor was used but the sensitivity of p-chlorophenol decreased by 40%. The increase in sensitivity towards PPD was due to additional catalytic function of the co-immobilized tyrosinase while the decrease in p-chlorophenol sensitivity was due to the blocking effect of the co-immobilized laccase which hinders mass transport through the immobilization layer. Similarly, ElKaoutit et al. [604], co-immobilized laccase and tyrosinase phenoxidase Sonogel-Carbon electrode using glutaric dialdehyde as crosslinker and nafion-ion exchanger as a protective additive. The electrode was used in a biosensing system to detect polyphenols in beer.

(p41.1) Co-immobilization of laccases from different sources has also been explored. For example, Vera et al. [608], co-immobilized laccase from Aspergillus sp., M. thermophile, and T. versicolor on poly (glycidyl methacrylate) microspheres. The biocatalyst showed a wide optimal pH range (2.0-7.0), high thermal, mechanical, and storage stabilities compared to the free and single-immobilized laccases.
