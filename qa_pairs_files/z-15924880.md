## (s4) Atlantic Niño
(p4.0) The pioneering work of [4] and also [6][7][8] demonstrated that an Atlantic Niño (Niña) increases the probability for a Pacific La Niña (El Niño) event several months later.This inter-basin teleconnection is also verified in the ATL_VAR experiment.

(p4.1) Figure 1 presents the regression of the June-to-September (JJAS) ATL3 index (defined as the SST anomalies averaged in the region (340 • E to 360 • E , 3 • S to 3 • N) onto the observed and ATL_VAR following December-to-March (DJFM) SST anomalies.An eastern Pacific equatorial cooling surrounded by a horse-shoe pattern of warmer SSTs in western tropical Pacific are associated with an equatorial Atlantic warming in both, the observational and modelled data (although with half of the magnitude in the model).Nevertheless, there is no agreement between observed and modeled anomalies in the Indian Ocean region.
## (s5) North Tropical Atlantic-Pacific Teleconnection
(p5.0) In [14,15], the teleconnection of the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) SSTs to the tropical Pacific has been analyzed, and it has been found that SST anomalies in the NTA also favor the development of central Pacific ENSO events.Similar to [14,15], we define an index representative of the North Tropical Atlantic (60

(p5.1) The season for the NTA index definition is February-to-April (FMA), as suggested by [14], according to the peak of the maximum variability of this subtropical region.The previous boreal winter (December-to-March) Niño3.4 effect is linearly removed from the FMA NTA index.Figures 4-6 show similar regressions to those of Figures 1-3 but using the NTA index instead of the ATL3 index.The SST, SLP and low-level wind, as well as ocean temperature fields are defined in the DJFM season following the FMA season [14,15].The results are rather similar to those of Figures 1-3 and are indicating a La Niña development, that is consistent with the findings of [14,15].For ATL_VAR, the response is stronger compared to the response to the Atlantic Niño, and comparable in magnitude to the observed response.However, there is no indication of the response to the NTA being more central Pacific ENSO events compared to the response to the ATL3 as suggested by [14,15], either in observations or the model results.It is possible that that results depend on the exact period analyzed.Overall, however, the studies of [14,15] are confirmed in the respect that a warming (cooling) in the tropical North Atlantic indeed leads to a La Niña (El Niño)-type response in the Pacific region.

(p5.2) The results from the teleconnection with Atl3 and NTA over the tropical Pacific are very similar.Indeed, a better agreement is observed between model and observations in the NTA forcing.The NTA SST pattern is most pronounced in boreal spring ( [49]), and the FMA season contains the early part of boreal spring.However, the above results are insensitive to which part of the boreal spring season is used to define the NTA index.For example, results are very similar if the NTA index is defined in the May-to-July season (not shown).
## (s8) Multidecadal Atlantic-Pacific Teleconnection
(p8.0) In this section, the AMO (e.g., [52]) teleconnection with the Indo-Pacific region, suggested by [22], will be re-visited using the Atlantic Pacemaker experiments.Figures 10 and 11 show the regression of the observed AMO index onto observed and ATL_VAR annual mean SSTs (Figure 10a,b), as well as observed and ATL_VAR annual mean SLP and low-level winds (Figure 11a,b).The AMO index has been defined as 10-year running mean of the (detrended) annual mean SSTs in the North Atlantic (70
## (s9) Centennial Atlantic-Pacific Teleconnection
(p9.0) In order to investigate the Atlantic-Pacific connection at even longer time scales, suggested by [16,37], we analyze the trend in the observational and ATL_VAR data.From the experimental set-up that does not include time-dependent CO 2 forcing, it is clear that the direct impact of CO 2 increase on the Indo-Pacific region cannot be investigated using the ATL_VAR experiment.Nevertheless, the model can be used to isolate the Atlantic impact on the Indo-Pacific at centennial time scales.Figure 15a,b shows the observed and modelled linear trends in SSTs for the periods 1901-2010, respectively.In the observations, a general warming can be found, but the eastern Pacific shows a slight cooling.On the one hand, ATL_VAR shows a much stronger eastern Pacific cooling, which is not surprising as the local CO 2 -induced eastern Pacific warming is not present in the model.On the other hand, a substantial part of the Indian Ocean and western Pacific warming can be reproduced by just the Atlantic forced experiment.On the subsurface, the observations (Figure 16a) also show strong cooling of up to 3 K in the eastern Pacific, which is weakened close to the surface, presumably due to CO 2 -induced warming.The ATL_VAR subsurface trend (Figure 16b) is also a cooling in the eastern Pacific, but it is weaker in magnitude compared to the observed cooling.A substantial subsurface cooling trend in the equatorial eastern Pacific has also been reported by [54].This shows that the rate of the Atlantic warming may be crucial to understand the structure of the SST changes in other ocean basins, consistent with [16,37].
