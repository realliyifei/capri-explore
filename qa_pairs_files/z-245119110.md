# Ofatumumab: A Review in Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis Ofatumumab: clinical considerations in relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis Convenient self-administered treatment regimen (once- monthly subcutaneous injections) Significantly reduces annualized relapse rate, MRI- detected lesion activity and disability progression com- pared with teriflunomide Generally manageable tolerability profile; AESIs include infections and injection-related reactions

## (s2) Therapeutic Efficacy of Ofatumumab
(p2.0) In phase II trials (APLIOS [13], APOLITOS [14] and MIR-ROR [15]), SC ofatumumab was associated with significant reductions in new brain lesion activity (from baseline or versus placebo), as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in patients with relapsing forms of MS. Due to the availability of phase III data, the phase II trials are not discussed further.
## (s18) Therapeutic Efficacy of Ofatumumab
(p18.0) In phase II trials (APLIOS [13], APOLITOS [14] and MIR-ROR [15]), SC ofatumumab was associated with significant reductions in new brain lesion activity (from baseline or versus placebo), as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in patients with relapsing forms of MS. Due to the availability of phase III data, the phase II trials are not discussed further.
