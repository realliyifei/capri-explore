## (s1) OVERVIEW OF THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO ECOSYSTEM
(p1.0) Physiography.-TheGulf of Mexico is a semienclosed, warm temperate to tropical sea that is approximately 1.5 million km 2 in area, communicating with the Caribbean Sea north and south of the Island of Cuba and bounded by the United States to the north and by Mexico to the west and south (Fig. 1).The continental shelf off the west coast of Florida, most of Texas and Louisiana, and the Yucatan Peninsula is broad, but the shelf narrows near the outlet of the Mississippi River.The northern Gulf shelf is incised by river-derived canyons, notably the Mississippi and DeSoto Canyons.

(p1.1) The most extensive slope environments are located off northeastern Mexico, Bay of Campeche, Texas, and Louisiana and consist mainly of muddy sediments derived from continental erosion (Uchupi, 1968).Underlying salt diapirs provide some topographic complexity, the Flower Garden Banks off Texas and Louisiana and the pinnacles off Mississippi and Alabama being prime examples.They affect local to meso-scale oceanography, as deep-water currents tend to be guided by bottom topography.Much of the sediment outflow of the Mississippi River continues downslope through the Mississippi Trough and Canyon, which bisects the continental slope close to its narrowest point.
