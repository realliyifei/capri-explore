## (s2) MCUSUM Methods
(p2.0) Healy (1987) used the sequential probability ratio tests, in order to develop a MCUSUM chart (Healy, 1987).Let i x be the ith observation, that follows a multi normal distribution   00 , p N   with an in- control mean vector 0  and a known covariance matrix 0  .Let 1  be the out-of-control mean vector.
