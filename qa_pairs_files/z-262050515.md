## (s1) New Ocean Corrosion Monitoring Technology and Application
(p1.0) According to the characteristics of corrosion monitoring technology, it can be divided into direct monitoring technology and indirect monitoring technology.The direct monitoring technology measures the parameters that change directly due to corrosion or erosion, while the indirect monitoring technology measures the parameters that affect corrosion or erosion or change due to corrosion or erosion.Usually, when metal structures are used in the ocean, electrochemical corrosion and erosion corrosion are the main corrosion behaviors, and the corresponding corrosion monitoring technology are also matched with the two corrosion behaviors.At present, the commonly used monitoring means is the monitoring of corrosion current and corrosion potential.Taking oil platforms as an example, corrosion potential monitoring devices are widely used in most petroleum platforms, and through judging the coating damage condition and the working condition of the cathodic protection system, they can monitor the corrosion potential [1].The reference electrode uses Ag/AgCl electrode to collect the corrosion potential distribution data of different parts and then analyze it systematically.When the local coating is broken, the corrosion potential of the broken part decreases compared to the corrosion potential of the intact part.We can qualitatively judge the damage of the coating system through the change of corrosion potential.In addition, through corrosion potential monitoring, we can also determine the operation of the sacrificial anode cathodic protection system of the oil platform.When the sacrificial anode reaches the lower limit of consumption, or the local arrangement is unreasonable, the corresponding protection potential will be different from the standard potential.From this difference, we can judge the operation of the cathodic protection system.In addition to conventional potential and current detection, a variety of electrical, magnetic, acoustic and other technical means are also used in marine corrosion detection [2].
## (s3) Non-destructive Monitoring of Alternating current field measurement (ACFM) Technology
(p3.0) Alternating current field measurement (ACFM) is a nondestructive testing technology developed from ACPD.The theoretical analysis of ACFM was completed by University of London in 1980s.In the early 90s, it began to be applied to the detection of offshore oil platforms.ACFM uses the effect that defects in conductive materials change the distribution of electromagnetic fields to produce piezoelectrography, and determines defects by measuring changes in the distribution of electromagnetic fields and comparing them with electromagnetic fields formed by standard ideal defects.This method combines ACPD and eddy current detection methods, and realizes detection by measuring the magnetic field change near the surface of the detection area, rather than the electric field voltage, so that non-contact defects detection can be achieved.The specific method of determining the size of the defect using the ACFM non-contact method is used: First, an alternating current is input in the area to be measured, and due to the "skin effect", the alternating current will collect on the surface of the conductor.If there is a defect in the test piece, the current line will be deflected near the defect, thereby inducing a distorted magnetic field on the test piece.We can then measure the change in the component of the magnetic field with a magnetic field probe to determine the length and depth of the crack [5].ACFM has the following characteristics: (1) Fast detection speed, high precision, qualitative and quantitative detection of crack defects at one time; (2) Implementing non-contact detection without cleaning the paint and coating of the tested surface; (3) Any electrical conductor material can be measured; (4) No complicated instrument calibration is required; (5) Minimize the error caused by human factors; (6) High stability and resolution, it can accurately detect the length and depth of cracks; (7) Sufficient accuracy regardless of the size of the defect; (8) Good adaptability.Due to the above characteristics, ACFM is expected to dominate the area of the detection of underwater structural crack defects, replacing underwater ultrasound, magnetic particle and other detection technologies.
## (s4) Field Signature Method (FSM)
(p4.0) FSM (Field Signature Method) is a new type of non-destructive detection technology developed by Corr Ocean Company of Norway.This method is mainly used to detect all kinds of corrosion, and can also detect most cracks and monitor corrosion and crack propagation.

(p4.1) The principle is to arrange the probes or electrodes in an array in the area to be measured, then measure the minute changes in the electric field through the metal structure, and compare the measured voltage value with the initially set measurement value to detect metal loss, cracks, pits or grooves due to corrosion or the like.Based on FSM technology, a portable FSM non-destructive detection instrument (FSM-IT) is developed [6].The detection technology has the following main advantages (1) The detection precision is high and the detection result is not influenced by operator;

(p4.2) (2) It can be used to detect complex geometry, and the use of FSM technology can greatly reduce the detection time; (3) Due to the remote detection capability, the cost of building scaffolding is reduced or eliminated; (4) For general corrosion, its sensitivity is higher than 0.5% of the remaining wall thickness.That is, the actual sensitivity will increase with the increase of corrosion, and at the same time, its repeatability is better; (5) there is no need to remove the coating, which greatly saves the detection cost and time.
## (s5) Monitoring of Underwater Robot Probe and Imaging Technology
(p5.0) The detection of underwater robot probe and imaging technology is mainly applicable for the detection of corrosion conditions in relatively deep water (greater than 50m).Using the deep water compression resistance of the underwater robot and the clear imaging technology, the photos and videos are taken to intuitively observe the corrosion status of the underwater steel structure.The potential probe is used to measure the cathodic protection potential of the underwater steel structure, understand the corrosion status in time, and take corresponding measures [7].
