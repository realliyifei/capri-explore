## (s1) Discussion
(p1.0) Although there are not many articles comparing deleterious effects on bone microarchitecture caused by alcohol abuse in each gender [5] according to Turner et al. [3] alcohol consumption decreases BMD in different skeletal sites [3]. It is known that the skeleton is composed of cortical and trabecular bone, in different proportions, and both are affected by chronic alcohol intake [1].
