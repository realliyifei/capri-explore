## (s2) Articles collection and screening
(p2.0) The methodology of the study included 3 main stages with their description and results presented in Table 1.The methodology, including its approach to searching for the articles, defining the review categories, and examining the collected articles, has been used in similar studies (Agi et al., 2021;Serenko, 2013;Seuring & Müller, 2008).In Stage 1, the study conducted a comprehensive search and collection of the review articles in the following steps.

(p2.1) Step 1.A search in Scopus.An initial search for the literature review studies in PPP was performed in Scopus.First, on its advanced search string, the search was performed using terms such as "public-private partnership(s), PPP, private finance initiative, PFI, build-operate-transfer, BOT".Second, in order to get closer to locating "literature review" articles, the search was further delimited using review-related terms such as "analysis, evaluation, assessment, content analysis, review, ranking, trend, growth, productivity, citation collaboration, intellectual structure, state-of-the-art, discipline, field, literature, area, visualisation, mapping, scientometrics, bibliometrics".This initial search resulted in a list of 887 articles.Then, the study routinely assessed the details of these articles that included reading their abstracts, keeping trusted journals, reading the full text of the articles, and disregarding the articles which reviewed PPP applications in a single country/region (not reviewed an attribute which portrays the identity of the research field).Also, the study excluded the articles which were not reviews (a literature review was not the main purpose of a study) or were non-PPP articles (e.g., when PPP meant "purchasing power parity", BOT meant "internet bot", etc.).This assessment resulted in 46 articles.
## (s3) Defining review categories
(p3.0) To determine the review categories (Stage 2 in Table 1), the paper used a mix of deductive and inductive approaches.The deductive process was applied to select the categories which represented common structural components of a review study.For this, similar review studies from the management area were examined whose purpose was to review literature or reveal the identity of a field (Agi et al., 2021;Kumar et al., 2020;Pollack & Adler, 2015;Serenko, 2013).In pursuing this, the study also consulted seminal studies on how to write literature reviews (Denney & Tewksbury, 2013;Seuring & Müller, 2008;Van Wee & Banister, 2016).Then, an initial set of the categories, adapted from these studies, were evaluated as to their relevance to the PPP review literature.For this, the inductive process was used, which implied reading of the 61 articles to verify this relevance.This process continued until all articles in the dataset were reviewed and stopped when it became clear that identified categories were enough for describing the collected articles from the meta-analysis perspective.Overall, using such deductive and inductive approaches to defining the review categories implies the comprehensiveness of the current study's methodology that has also been applied in similar research (Serenko, 2013;Seuring & Müller, 2008).

(p3.1) As a result of this stage, 7 review categories were identified, presented in Table 1.Concerning the categories purpose of study and methods used, since an article may set more than one purpose or apply several methods, this study used all purposes (Table 2) and methods used (Table 3) per each article.Regarding the category dataset details, per an examined article (if applicable), the study defined the number of sources reviewed by the article, the review period covered, keywords used to search for sources, and databases used to collect the sources.The category journal and author details aimed to define the Table 1.Methodology of the current study
## (s7) Journal and author details
(p7.0) The 61 studies were published in 40 journals and 12 of them published more than one review article (Table A1 in Appendix).Broadly, in terms of research focus, 5 groups of journals can be identified: 16 in construction and project management (with 30 papers), 8 in public administration and management (with 12 papers), 8 in economics and business management (with 10 papers), 4 in healthcare management (with 5 papers), and 4 in transportation research (with 4 papers).This corroborates with the statement that the research in PPP emerged from the CME, EC, and PAM disciplines (Hodge & Greve, 2007;Ke et al., 2009;Kwak et al., 2009;Wang et al., 2018); the groups that are also the most influential, receiving the majority of citations.However, the overall publication trend of the PPP review literature shows the growing interest also in the HCM and TR disciplines, especially in the last few years.

(p7.1) In terms of authors, the dataset is represented by 150 authors and 177 authorship appearances (2.9 authors per article).Table A2 in Appendix lists the most productive authors found by the approach of Howard et al. (1987).The most productive scholar has a score of 2.17
## (s16) Suggestions for future review studies
(p16.0) Based on the findings from the examination of the 61 review articles across the review categories, the following are suggestions for future review-type studies that may help to shape the identity of the PPP review literature.

(p16.1) First, the PPP academic literature is not yet likely to achieve its maturity.It is just expanding in Phase IV (Figure 3) and the next evolution phase may be on the aggregation of the PPP review research.For this, the PPP scholars should adapt and examine relevant theories, paradigms, and methods from allied management fields, across multiple disciplines, and types of PPP projects (e.g., healthcare, transportation, utilities PPPs).For example, recently, Narbaev et al. (2020) proposed 4 distinct research domains in the field: the domain of partnership, public welfare, worldwide diffusion, and project level.These domains were developed with their associated disciplinary bases (e.g., CME, PAM, TR) and contributing theories (e.g., contract theory, governance theory, optimisation theory, new public management theory).

(p16.2) Another suggestion is that the growing objective method-based research should be complemented with more subjective method-based works like narrative and conceptual reviews.Journals should welcome such review studies.Often, such reviews are critical, challenging, or even pessimistic but call to rethink the evolving onestream progression in the field.This is likely to pave new research directions that include addressing PPP outsidethe-box and broadening the research agenda to broader economic, political, and social contexts.Recent works by Hodge and Greve (2017) and Sherratt et al. (2020) are exemplary in this respect.
## (s17) Main research avenues
(p17.0) In the section on the evolution of the PPP review literature, the study presented the main characteristics of the literature evolution, including the changes in the review categories.One of such categories is the purpose of study that includes research of a specific area or topic (Table 2).The analysis of this category, in general, and of specific topics reported in the previous studies, in particular, revealed that some research areas were trending.From the meta-analysis perspective, the following are the main avenues for future studies in PPP.

(p17.1) First, research into PPP project governance.Effective governance frameworks, stakeholders management, and sustainable cooperation between the public and private sectors are the core areas of research that keep attracting scholarly interest (Dewulf & Garvin, 2020;Hodge & Greve, 2010;Song et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2018).This is important in balancing their interests: the public agency with social value objectives and the private sector with revenue and profit objectives.

(p17.2) Second, research into the complexity of PPP arrangements.Investigation of collaboration, negotiation, tendering, and procurement in the PPP contracts are the promising areas for future studies.In recent years, as the findings showed, applications of modelling techniques like using game theory, fuzzy set theory, real options, and system dynamics will be critical to better understand the above problems, especially under uncertain environment or information asymmetry (Button, 2016;Guo et al., 2021;Ke et al., 2009;Pagoni & Georgiadis, 2020;Sarmento & Renneboog, 2016;Song et al., 2016).

(p17.3) Third, the research into PPP transfer, post-transfer, or termination phases.The findings showed that, over the last decade, especially in developing and emerging markets, many PPP projects in healthcare, transportation, utilities sectors are being completed and transferred into operation, or back to the public sector, or terminated.Consequently, the research into PPP transfer, post-transfer, or termination phases is one of the areas to grow in the near future (Bao et al., 2018;South et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2020a).
## (s18) Conclusions
(p18.0) This paper presented a first meta-analysis of the literature review studies in PPP in order to consolidate the literature, better understand the identity of the field, and provide suggestions for future review studies.Using a meta-analysis approach, it analysed 61 review studies published during 2001-2020 across the defined review categories.The categories included the purpose of study, methods used, primary disciplinary focus, dataset details, journal and author details, awareness of previous review studies, and the evolution of the PPP review literature.These categories represented structural components of a review study and specific characteristics of the review studies in PPP.

(p18.1) The main findings of this review study suggest the following.In terms of the purpose of study, risks, critical success factors, and PPP models are the most reviewed topics, while content analysis and systematic review dominate among the review methods in the literature.Among the primary disciplines where the PPP literature prevails, the CME discipline is leading, followed by the HCM and TR disciplines.The field has become truly multi-disciplinary but suffers from over-differentiation with contradictory findings across multiple disciplines.In terms of the PPP literature evolution, it has progressed through four phases: from initiation, formation, growth, to expansion.Future review works should involve more empirical studies and examine the practical relevance of the PPP research.Among the promising research areas are PPP governance, complexity, post-transfer phases, sustainability-related issues, and real estate development through PPP.

(p18.2) The primary contributions of this study are fourfold.First, the PPP scholars in each of the representing disciplines and examining various types of PPP projects (healthcare, transportation, utilities, and other economic and social infrastructure) will benefit from understanding the field's identity under the lens of a multi-disciplinary perspective, how its identity is currently being formed, and where the literature is evolving.Second, the paper adds a new meta-analysis approach and perspective to the existing review-research genre in PPP that can be extended in future review studies.Lastly, for the construction engineering and management research community, the study offers an overview of the most critical topics on PPP, the methods used to analyze them, and the problems that exist in planning and implementing PPP projects.Fourth, for the strategic property management researchers, the study suggests the trending topics, including profitability factors, financial aspects, and sustainability issues for the urban redevelopment, land use, and industrial property development and operation.

(p18.3) The study acknowledges the following limitations that could be addressed in future research.First, a meta-analysis is a broad analytical approach.The current work used it for the analysis of analyses (i.e., review of reviews) to integrate research findings and it covered review results (Glass, 1976).However, it is also used as a technique to integrate empirical results of independent studies using statistics (see, for example, Chen et al., 2016), such as regression or analysis of variances (Hedges & Olkin, 1985), which was not the intended purpose of the current study.Also, the articles which reviewed PPP practices in a single country or with a regional focus were not included in the review.Given the paper's purpose and scope of the review, adding them into the analysis would require a change in the approach and extend the review focus into country/region specific issues.
