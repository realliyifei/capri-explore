## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) S MARTWATCHES are powerful personal data collection devices and allow wearers to see various types of data measured from their body, their activities, or their environment.Previous research has shown that people can perform simple comparison tasks with visualizations on smartwatches within several hundred milliseconds [1], providing evidence that visualizations are effective forms of data representations in the context of wearable devices.The usage context and form factor of small wearable displays, however, pose unique design challenges that require further dedicated research.In this work, we focus on reviewing watch face designs, the context in which visualizations are shown, establishing a design space for smartwatch faces in terms of data and visualizations they can communicate, and pointing to open research opportunities for smartwatch visualizations.
## (s2) Smartwatch Visualization Challenges
(p2.0) Tasks.Albers et al. [17] showed that tasks viewers conduct when exploring a visualization are influenced by the design of visual displays and choices of visual encodings, such as position and color.Additionally, the mapping variables employed in visualization, including the approach to data aggregation, also influence the viewers' tasks.For instance, a visualization may show the raw data or averages.Computed aggregates enable the visualization to perform tasks that would otherwise fall to the viewer.Designing smartwatch faces to align with common tasks is important because designs may impact the wearers' tasks.The properties of smartwatch faces may also affect visualization reading tasks (e. g., space available, complications/visualizations shown), may constrain visualization design (overall style or theme that needs to be followed), and may be competing for visual attention (e. g., decorations).Smartwatches also present distinctive usage challenges that are much unlike the usage of visualizations on desktop screens.For example, on average people look at a smartwatch for just 5-7 seconds [11], [18], [19], primarily to read the time (around 1.9 seconds [11]).

(p2.1) The extent to which additional information can be understood from a quick look at the watch face remains uncertain.To answer this question, researchers studied low-level perceptual tasks to understand glanceability of smartwatch visualizations [1], [20], the impact of visual parameters (e. g., size, frequency, color) on reaction times [21], or representation preferences in an air traffic control usage scenario [22].

(p2.2) Representations.Recently, researchers started to conduct dedicated research on dedicated visualization techniques for smartwatches.Some of these research efforts target novel types of representations such as Chen's temporal data [23], Suciu and Larsen's time spiral [13], or Neshati et al.'s compressed line charts [24], [25].In their exploratory studies, Amini et al. [12] showed that minimal designs and simple data-driven visualizations in the form of charts have great potential to support in-situ data exploration on small smartwatch displays.Pekta≈ü et al. [26] showed how simple diabetes-related visualizations using icons and emojis on warnings and alerts could motivate wearers to monitor health-related information.Gouveia et al. [15] proposed six design qualities for smartwatches through an iterative ideation process.These design qualities include abstraction, integrating with activities, supporting comparisons to targets and norms, being actionable, leading to checking habits, and facilitating engagement when designing representations for glanceable feedback on physical activity trackers.

(p2.3) Customization and Personalization.Despite the growing capabilities of smartwatches, which can effectively capture and communicate a vast amount of information to wearers, some wearers risk abandoning these devices and missing out on potential benefits.This can occur when there is a lack of context-specific data representation or inadequate design of visualizations.Niess et al. [27] studied the impact of various approaches to represent unmet fitness goals on trackers through visualization on rumination, highlighting that multicolored charts on fitness trackers may lead to demotivation and negative thought cycles.Havlucu et al. [28] interviewed 20 professional tennis players and found that the abandonment of their fitness trackers was due to the type of information displayed on the smartwatches.The participants wanted specific tennis-related information, including recovery rate, nutrition, and details about their performance.They were interested in knowing where the ball hit their racket, the speed of a stroke, how the ball bounced off the floor, overall mobility on the court, and any weaknesses or errors in the game.Schiewe et al. [29] studied realtime feedback during running activities for 40 participants.Their participants preferred visualizations over textual representations for self-serviced concurrent visual feedback on smartwatches.

(p2.4) Our work focuses primarily on visualizations on smartwatch faces.Being the home screen of a watch, watch faces are the most frequently seen screen of a smartwatch.It is important to understand more broadly how these small-screen displays are designed, as they provide the context in which visualizations may be seen.
## (s4) A SYSTEMATIC SMARTWATCH FACE REVIEW
(p4.0) To complement our prior survey [3] and to gain a deeper understanding of design considerations for smartwatch faces, we collected watch face designs and conducted a systematic review.We study smartwatch faces because they are the context in which smartwatch visualizations are shown, and thus they may influence visualization design (e. g., if an overall style or theme needs to be followed) and visualization reading (e.g., available space, number of complications).Studying smartwatch faces, in particular data shown on them, also highlights opportunities for visualizations.In this section, we detail our methodology and report results.
## (s5) Data Collection and Analysis
(p5.0) Our prior work [3] relied on participants' own descriptions of their smartwatch faces that we could not systematically verify.To address this limitation, we conducted a systematic review of premium (paid) watch faces from a popular watch face app and website.We focused on premium watch faces because we considered these to exhibit an acceptable level of design professionalism.The alternative of collecting watch face screenshots from a large number of participants would have been technically infeasible and potentially privacy invasive.Screenshots are difficult to take and transfer from watch to study platform for non-tech-savvy populations and watch faces often contain privacy sensitive information, such as locations or body measurements.
## (s7) What is Displayed on a Watch Face?
(p7.0) Number of Complications.The watch faces contained a median of 4 complications similar to our prior work [3], in which participants reported a median of 5.However, we saw a difference in the number of watch faces with only one complication.While (13.41%
## (s10) Watch Face External Factors
(p10.0) Factors external to the watch face may influence its design (Fig. 1 Externals).The watch itself (device driven) defines the shape (form factor), display size (watch dimension), display type, and display resolution, which may influence choices in other parts of the design space.For example, the display type (such as OLED or E-ink) has a great influence on colors available to style the graphics and to represent data as visualizations.

(p10.1) E-ink watch faces, for example, have fewer colors and lower display refresh rates making animations difficult.They nevertheless have the potential for sport and activity smartwatches because of their paper-like characteristics, lightweight nature, low battery consumption, and readability in sunlight [60].In contrast, OLED displays have greater color quality than other technologies.In recent years, OLED displays have risen to prominence as the main display technology for wearable devices.Most high-end smartwatches, including Apple and Samsung, use this technology.Due to the excellent image quality, OLED displays offer great possibilities for fashionable smartwatch face designs.

(p10.2) In addition to the display type, the display shape (form factor) has a profound impact on the layout and the graphics design.Watch faces now mostly come with square or circular displays; content is often shaped to match and create a harmonious aesthetic, which can, in turn, constrain the types of visualizations that can be shown.Moreover, personal factors such as intended usage context or fashion preferences play an important role in the watch face design.Purchasing decisions may be made on whether a smartwatch would be wearable in casual or business contexts and whether it goes with a certain fashion, as seen in previous work [61].We expect that for some wearers similar decisions play a role for smartwatch faces and their design styles and overall look and consequently visualization use.
## (s13) Watch Face Data Representations
(p13.0) Each watch face component's digital representation has at minimum a position, size, shape, and color scheme or texture (visual features).In this section, we focus our discussion on watch face complications that represent data other than time (Fig. 1 Representation).

(p13.1) One of the difficulties of designing a complication for smartwatches is that the data category it shows needs to be identifiable, for example, as steps, heart rate, or calories.Designers can place signs to identify data categories or rely on wearers to learn and memorize a mapping.The types of signs that can identify a data category include-text labels that specify the category (e. g., "steps"), accompanying icons (e. g., a foot icon for step count), and text units (e. g., "km" for distance traveled).The "three rings" on the Apple Watch is instead, an example of a mapping that requires learning .It uses three concentric radial bar charts with memorable colors but without a sign to represent what each colored rings stands for: movement, exercise, and standing.One of the advantages of memorized mappings is that no display space needs to be dedicated to labels, units, or icons.

(p13.2) In our evaluations, we observed that most smartwatches face complications represented data with combinations of text, icons, and charts.Most data encoded a single data value .More complex encodings, however, are certainly possible (e.g., multiple points over time or space ) and designers can take inspiration from more complex micro visualizations such as in work on wordscale visualizations [62], [63] or data glyphs [64].
## (s15) Representation Types
(p15.0) Text is the most common form of data representation on smartwatch faces.Text can be styled through font type, size, and color, which can also be used to encode additional information, for example, as in word clouds.However, we rarely saw font-size based encodings on actual watch faces despite them having been mentioned in research [12].

(p15.1) Icons on watch faces are widely used for labeling but rarely to represent data.They can be used for categories if icons exist to meaningfully identify the categories.This is the case for weather data where viewers are familiar with icons that represent a rainy or sunny day.It would be harder to find icons that represent REM, Light, or Deep sleep stages.

(p15.2) There are two options to use an icon to represent quantitative data: a) designers can turn the quantity into an order or category and use a visual variable for categories such as hue, texture, or position or b) add a visual variable to the icon that can represent a quantity such as position, size, area, flicker, etc.For example, suppose a designer wants to represent the quantity of calories burned with an icon.In that case, they first have to choose an icon that represents calories; a fire icon is relatively common.Next, the designer could apply a sequential color scale ( ), size the icon relative to a quantity ( ), or apply animationrelated variables such as flicker.Icons can also be stacked to create unit-based pictographs.Similar examples we saw includ step counts represented by different shoe icons (e. g., walking, running, climbing), but examples were rare.
## (s19) Holistic Study of Smartwatch Faces
(p19.0) Watch face visualizations do not only need to be small but they also need to be integrated into a coherent watch face theme.As a personal data dashboard, watch faces not only make fashion statements but can also play an important role to facilitate decision making.We identified several open research questions that relate to the integration of visualizations in watch faces.

(p19.1) Designer's Vision vs. Use in Practice.Through our prior work [3] and current review, we observed a tension between a watch face design vision and the use of watch faces in practice.While a big part of the market designs included a single complication (18%), 99% of people in our prior work [3] reported to have more than one complication on their watch face.We suspect that wearers often customize or personalize their watch faces to include more complications than the designer intended.Thus, while smartwatch designers may decide to follow design guidelines and recommended practices from the visualization community in their implementations, it is possible that smartwatch wearers make customization choices that violate these guidelines and practices.We can try to help wearers use a more appropriate design, for example, by suggesting best locations for placing a complication depending on clutter, background color, etc.Nevertheless, smartwatches remain personal devices, and wearers are (and should) ultimately be in control.As a community, we need to consider the right balance of allowing wearers to feel empowered in their customization, without being constrictive in our attempt to guide them.
## (s20) Smartwatch Technology and Interactivity
(p20.0) In the future, we will see displays of different shapes emerge for which dedicated watch face designs have to be developed.First prototypes of watchstrap displays [82] as well as curved displays [31] have emerged.Other types of embedded screens in clothing or as wristbands will emerge and we have to understand how watch faces can be designed for these non-flat displays.

(p20.1) An issue related to display technology is how wearers can interact with the shown content.Few interactions with visualizations on watch faces have been implemented to mitigate "fat finger problems" (e.g., Bezel Interaction [7], EdgeSelect Interaction [8]).At this point mostly simple swipes and taps are used on touch-enabled watch faces.These allow, for example, switches between different representations or time intervals.Yet, more interactions that are complex have been explored for touch interactions on desktop-sized or tablet-sized charts (see [83], [84] for a summary).If they are useful and how they can be used in the context of smartwatches when the "fat finger problem" becomes even more acute is an interesting avenue for research.In addition to smartphones, many smartwatches are equipped with a microphone, allowing people to interact with them using speech.Therefore, recent research has started to investigate how to leverage touch and speech input for the collection or exploration of personal data on mobile devices [9], [10], [85].It would be valuable to explore further, how to leverage speech input to facilitate more fluid watch face interactions.
## (s21) The Role of Context
(p21.0) The primary intended context of a watch face's use needs to be considered in its graphical and interaction design.One important contextual factor is the potential movement of a wearer.Movement might lead to changing lighting conditions that can affect the readability of a watch face but movement also often entails a primary task such as driving or running.To what extent will movement affect people's ability to read a watch face such as during sports activities?The default for some Garmin watches, for example, is to show data during exercise using large black font on a white background without any visualizations.Is this the most effective and safe way to communicate data to wearers during other primary tasks?Especially contexts with divided attention, for example, glancing while driving, require further research attention.While driving, viewers can only afford quick glances at watch faces.Visualizations in these settings are difficult to evaluate and test and future work is needed.

(p21.1) Another important factor is the intended task context for watch faces.While much research has centered around improving personal health through watch face representations, there needs to be more focus on the visualization challenges related to other specific tasks on smartwatch faces (see Sec. 2.1).We also saw commercial watch faces target contexts of use that we had not seen in research such as entertainment, festival, or military usage.Carpendale et al. [14] showed that with dedicated ideation exercises watch faces could be envisioned that target specific usage contexts such as sightseeing in their case.Digital watch faces are easy to switch and it would be interesting to study the impact of dedicated but changing watch faces on wearers.
