## (s1) What is Tele-dentistry?
(p1.0) Many explanations and elucidations of teledentistry can be found on reviewing the literature, and each of these highlights its specific aspect.In the year 1997, Cook described tele dentistry as "the practice of using telecommunication technology to make a diagnosis and subsequently provide an advice on treatment from a remote distance." [8]Tele-dentistry is useful in providing consultation with dental specialists, supervising dental healthcare providers in remote areas and for their education through the use of various telecommunication tools like electronic health records, digital imaging, internet etc. Tele-dentistry is a combination of tools of telecommunication technology and the dentists and it involves exchanging clinical data (including images) from far-away areas for providing consultations and treatment planning.
## (s2) The Need for Tele-dentistry
(p2.0) Tele-dentistry possibly has the potential to enhance availability of oral healthcare, improving the oral healthcare delivery, and to reduce costs related to dentistry by facilitating prompt diagnosis, well timed management of diseases and to reduce seclusion of healthcare providers by allowing regular peer-to-peer communications.Tele-dentistry can also reduce inequalities in availability of oral healthcare between urban and rural areas. [9]There are many barriers in providing access to a good quality of oral healthcare in the rural communities which includes the shortage of oral healthcare providers in these rural areas, a long travelling distance to reach the limited healthcare providers available and the scanty local resources. [10]Most of the rural communities do not have the financial and clinical resources needed to attract oral healthcare specialists.The patients who live in rural areas when referred to dental healthcare specialists (mostly in urban settings), have to travel long distances to reach them, which more often than not is expensive as well as time-consuming.

(p2.1) Tele-dentistry has the potential to bridge this gap as it allows the oral healthcare providers of rural areas to take advice from urban dental specialists. [10]Currently, most of the tele-dentistry programs have their primary focus on distance management in administering oral healthcare in rural institutions, continuing dental education and learning programs and providing referral services after thorough teleconsultations.Tele-dentistry is still not used as a direct program for providing oral healthcare. [11]In order to allow such a widespread implementation of these tele-dentistry initiatives political support, in addition to implementation of appropriate health policies and strategies is a must.
## (s3) Tele-dentistry Methodologies
(p3.0) There are two forms of tele-consultation. [12]First one is "real-time consultation", which uses direct online video communication between a dentist, a hygienist, and/or a patient from a remote area and a dental specialist from a larger community who will the provide the necessary support or supervision.Also, a very common form is "store and forwarding method", which uses electronic health records and videos available in the form of stored data which can then be retrieved and can then be scrutinised by an expert, who will then give his/her opinion.Real-time consultation allows a more in-depth discussion and a better personal communication when compared to the store and forwarding method.Store and forwarding method also has the potential to provide sufficient benefit for a wide range of applications, and is considered to be almost as effective as realtime consultationin presentation of cases.

(p3.1) In a classic real-time videoconferencing technique, special videoconferencing tools and internet connections are set up at both the hub site and the remote site.A major challenge in real-time videoconferencing visit is the timely cooperation between the representatives of the hub and the remote site.Fig. 1 shows the process of communication between the remote site and the specialist clinical setup. [13]Teams of dentists at both sites must always work together to enable smooth processing of the tele-dentistry visit.The challenge begins with making the simultaneous appointments on both sites, progressing with patient information collection and transferring this information to the specialists, which then facilitates the "long-distance" real-time assessment of the patient, and ending with facilitating future treatment and care.As the specialist cannot examine the patient himself or herself, he or she has to rely on the examination performed by the dental team at the remote site and so confidence and a good working relation must be established between the numbers of dental teams at both the sites.Proper training, practice, and patience are all essential for a satisfying outcome, just like any other learning process.A reliable network for tele-dentistry can be established with an effective hands-on training and repeated practice of dental team members at both the sites.
