## (s2) Search Strategy
(p2.0) The Research Ethics Committee of Guang'anmen Hospital approved this study. Our study was based on previous publications. [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] We used the Web of Science database to carry out a computerized search for publications. The search was performed on April 12, 2015. We chose Web of Science because it is the world's leading database for citation information and other academic impact information. Also, it has been widely used in studies that are similar to ours. The search terms ''diabetes'' or ''diabetic'' were used as the topic of the search and the publication years were limited to 2005 to 2014.
