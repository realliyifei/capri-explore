## (s1) Ashwagandha's Active Substances and Their Biological Effects
(p1.0) W. somnifera, popularly known as Ashwagandha, is famous for its anti-inflammatory [17], anti-cancer [18][19][20], anti-depressant, anti-anxiety and insomnia-treating properties [21].In addition, there are scientific reports supporting the use of Ashwagandha in the treatment of infertility and hormonal disorders [12,16].Ashwagandha's remarkable medicinal properties are undoubtedly due to its wealth of active substances, which demonstrate a variety of actions.The different biological species of the Withania genus also differ in the content of these substances.This plant is abundant in ingredients such as alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, carbohydrates, steroidal lactones, β-sitosterol, scopoletin, sitoindosides, somniferiene, somniferinine, pseudotropine, anaferine, anahygrine, cysteine, chlorogenic acid, cuscohygrine, withanine, withaferine, withanolides, withananine, tropanol, 6,7β-epoxywithanon, and 14-α-hydroxywithanone [22].Different parts of the plant vary in the composition of chemical compounds [2].For example, the leaves contain five unidentified alkaloids, 12 withanolides, many free amino acids, chlorogenic acid, glycosides, glucose, condensed tannins and flavonoids.In addition, the roots are rich in alkaloids, amino acids, steroids, volatile oil, starch, reducing sugars, glycosides, hentriacontane, dulcitol and withaniol [23].It seems that this wealth of active substances is not yet fully understood and still requires further research.Table 1 shows the classification of the active substances found in Ashwagandha.

(p1.1) Table 1.Classification of the active substances in W. somnifera (data from Gaurav H., 2023 [22]).Withanolides and phenolic compounds are mainly responsible for the special medicinal properties of W. somnifera and show immune system-activating and antioxidant effects, respectively [23].Structurally, withanolides belong to the 28-carbon atoms of natural steroidal lactones, built on an ergostane skeleton in which C-22 and C-26 are oxidized to form six-or five-membered lactone rings.These compounds are also known as 22-hydroxy ergostane-26-oleic acid-26, 22-lactone.A characteristic feature of withanolides is that the C8 or C9 side chains exhibit a lactone or lactol ring.The lactone ring can be five-or six-membered and can be linked to the carbocyclic group of the molecule via a C-C bond or via an O-bridge [22].Of the withanolides isolated to date, withaferin A has received the most interest from researchers.It is found abundantly in W. somnifera and has great therapeutic potential-studies have shown that it has strong anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities [24].Structurally, withaferin A, or (4β,5β,6β,22R)-4,27-dihydroxy-5,6:22,26diepoxyergosta-2,24-diene-1,26-dione, is a 28-carbon withanolide with an ergostane and a δ-lactone structure [24].It has two hydrogen bond donors and six hydrogen bond acceptor groups, which make it highly reactive [24].Analysis of the chemical structure of withaferin A showed three positions that can interact with target proteins.Alkylation and nucleophilic binding reactions occur through the A ring at the C3 position and the epoxide at C24 [25].Figure 1 shows the general chemical structure of withanolides and withaferin A. bond acceptor groups, which make it highly reactive [24].Analysis of the chemical structure of withaferin A showed three positions that can interact with target proteins.Alkylation and nucleophilic binding reactions occur through the A ring at the C3 position and the epoxide at C24 [25].Figure 1 shows the general chemical structure of withanolides and withaferin A. In addition to withanolides, to which most research is currently dedicated, it is worth mentioning the remarkable properties of the phenolic compounds and alkaloids present in W. somnifera.Studies have shown that phenolic compounds in Ashwagandha have strong antioxidant and antibacterial properties, but the presence of these compounds determines the chemical composition of the formulation due to the origin of the raw materials and the plant part used, as well as the extraction protocol [23].It was proved that water extracts, which showed higher antioxidant and antibacterial activity than water-methanol extracts, were particularly rich in polyphenols and ascorbic acid.On the other hand, water-methanol extracts showed higher inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChe) than aqueous extracts, which inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (BChe) more strongly.These results suggest that there is a need to develop appropriate extraction methods to maximize the potential therapeutic properties of W. somnifera [23].The alkaloids contained in W. somnifera extracts have anti-inflammatory properties, and this effect is greater than that caused by withanolides.In addition, alkaloids are characterized by lower toxicity [26].Furthermore, anaferine and anahygrine, two alkaloids found in Ashwagandha, have been studied for anti-tuberculous properties and the development of new drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.The obtained molecular docking results confirm their promising properties against the causative agent of human tuberculosis [27].In silico studies have also shown that these substances may have neuroprotective properties and could potentially be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases [28][29][30].
## (s2) Compounds
(p2.0) When presenting the healing properties of Ashwagandha, it is important to mention the wide range of molecular mechanisms that it activates.One of the best-known compounds present in W. somnifera-withanolides, mainly withaferin A, withanolide D and withanone-exhibit antioxidant properties by increasing the activity of cellular antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase-SOD; catalase-CAT; glutathione S-transferase-GST; haem oxygenase 1-HO-1; NAD(P)H-quinone dehydrogenase 1) and a transcription factor-Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).Moreover, they have anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting prostaglandin (PGE2) synthesis by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide production by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the release of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1β) and nuclear factor κ light chain of activated B cells (NFκB) [12].Withanolides also exhibit apoptosis-inducing activity through the stimulation of a series of factors, such as the production of reactive oxygen species, BCL2-related protein X (Bax), death receptor 5 (DR5), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protease-activated In addition to withanolides, to which most research is currently dedicated, it is worth mentioning the remarkable properties of the phenolic compounds and alkaloids present in W. somnifera.Studies have shown that phenolic compounds in Ashwagandha have strong antioxidant and antibacterial properties, but the presence of these compounds determines the chemical composition of the formulation due to the origin of the raw materials and the plant part used, as well as the extraction protocol [23].It was proved that water extracts, which showed higher antioxidant and antibacterial activity than water-methanol extracts, were particularly rich in polyphenols and ascorbic acid.On the other hand, watermethanol extracts showed higher inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChe) than aqueous extracts, which inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (BChe) more strongly.These results suggest that there is a need to develop appropriate extraction methods to maximize the potential therapeutic properties of W. somnifera [23].The alkaloids contained in W. somnifera extracts have anti-inflammatory properties, and this effect is greater than that caused by withanolides.In addition, alkaloids are characterized by lower toxicity [26].Furthermore, anaferine and anahygrine, two alkaloids found in Ashwagandha, have been studied for anti-tuberculous properties and the development of new drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.The obtained molecular docking results confirm their promising properties against the causative agent of human tuberculosis [27].In silico studies have also shown that these substances may have neuroprotective properties and could potentially be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases [28][29][30].
## (s8) Regulating Hypothalamus, Pituitary Gland and Their Axis by Ashwagandha
(p8.0) Is it difficult to discuss the pituitary gland and hypothalamus as separate glands of the hormonal system.Together, they create a complex system of neuroendocrine pathways and feedback loops which maintain homeostasis.

(p8.1) Hypothalamus as an overriding hormonal gland, manages the activity of the pituitary gland due to its neurotransmitters and hormones it releases.In turn, the pituitary is made up of two lobes (anterior-secrets hormones produced in this gland; and posterior-releases hormones produced in hypothalamus).In this way, it controls such organs as kidneys by vasopressin (ACTH), breasts and uterus by oxytocin, also ovaries and testes trough the secretion of gonadotropins-lutropin (LH) and folliculotropin (FSH).It regulates the level of corticoids due to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion and its action on adrenal glands, breast by prolactin (PRL), liver, bones and muscles by growth hormone (GH), skin by melanotropin (MSH), lipid tissue by lipotropin (LPH) and finally regulates thyroid gland activity by thyrotropin (TSH).

(p8.2) Multiplicity and multidirectional actions of secreted hormones make any imbalance visible in consequences like infertility, menstrual disorders, growth disorders, weakness, somnolence, dysregulated blood pressure and others dependent on which pathways and feedback loops are dysregulated.Due to the above information, we would like to summarize how Ashwagandha and its active substances regulate the hypothalamus and pituitary gland activity, and the influence on the axis which they create with other endocrine glands.

(p8.3) The studies have shown that W. somnifera can exhibit its effect at the hypothalamic level.Kataria et al. isolated the hypothalamic clonal cell line, GnV-3 cells, which are GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) neurons isolated from rat brain.They proved that aqueous extract from Ashwagandha's leaves stimulates GnRH cells activity which results in increased GnRH release.Based on in vitro studies on mice hypothalamus slices, it was established that W. somnifera can exhibit GABA-mimetic action due to its interactions with GABA type A receptors [40].Thus, it leads to increased secretion of GnRH in hypothalamus and that is the way Ashwagandha can modulate HPG axis at the hypothalamic level [12].On the other hand, the other studies investigated how the GABAA receptor antagonists block the ability of methanolic root extract of Ashwagandha to induce depolarization in mice GnRH neurons in juvenile mice.Scientists depolarized GnRH neurons by bath application of Ashwagandhas methanolic extract.Using the patch clamp method, they proved that the W. somnifera-induced inward currents were suppressed by bicuculine methiodide-a GABAA receptor antagonist.In the above mentioned studies, the researchers came to the same conclusion that releasing GnRH can be modulated by GABA-mimetic action of W. somnifera [41].

(p8.4) To supplement the above, it should also be noticed that GABAA receptors are the main target of anti-anxiety drugs, so it can therefore be assumed that Ashwagandha reduces stress levels through that mechanism [21].Also high cortisol relation with the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) response to stress is well known.Many studies confirmed that illnesses like depression or anxiety disorders are associated with dysregulation of this axis, which results in increases cortisol and DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) levels.Inversely, there are also studies, which mention that high DHEA concentrations indicate high exposure to stress or overactivity of the HPA axis, which forms a coherent whole [2,21] Lopresti et al. performed a 60-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, during the 15-day intake of 240 mg of W. somnifera extract in mildly anxious, healthy sixty adults.The extract was standardized by high-performance liquid chromatography to contain 35% withanolide glycosides-approximately 84 mg withanolide.Participants were instructed to take 1 capsule (with 84 mg withanolide glycosides), once daily after dinner with 250 mL of water.Such therapy resulted in significant emotional improvement over time, measured by reduction in HAM-A score (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) and reduction in morning cortisol and DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) levels.Based on the HAM-A score, they deduced that anxiety level reduced by 41% in the test group and only by 24% in the placebo group.These conclusions were further confirmed by positive improvements in DASS-21 (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21)-30% in the study group vs. 10% in the placebo group.As the explanation of these results, authors suggested that Ashwagandha may have an attenuating effect on the HPA axis activity, what was confirmed by the decreased level of fasting morning cortisol level (0.5% decrease in placebo group and 23% decrease in the study group) and DHEA-S (2.5% increase and 8.2% decrease, respectively) in male participants.Statistically significant changes in levels of these hormones occurred in both sexes [16].Another research group came to the same conclusions by conducting an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 60 participants were divided into three groups-a control group, one group receiving 250 mg of Ashwagandha root extract per day and the third group receiving 600 mg/day of Ashwagandha root extract.As a stress gauge, serum cortisol level was used, measured at a baseline, at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks of treatment; HAM-A was used to assess the intensity of anxiety, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score and a sleep quality was measured by a 7-point scale questionnaire.In both study groups, serum cortisol levels were significantly lower than in placebo group at the eighth week.Also, the improvement in anxiety reduction and sleep were noticed.The observed effects were dose dependent [42].
