## (s9) V. GAUGED FLAVOR AND RPV PATTERN
(p9.0) There are many attempts in the literature to understand the flavor problem. One promising direction starts from the realization that in the limit of vanishing Yukawas of the standard model, the family (flavor) symmetry of the model becomes [SU (3)] 5 . The hope then is that breaking of this symmetry could provide an understanding of the flavor pattern of fermions.
