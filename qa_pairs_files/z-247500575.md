## (s7) Representative Methods
(p7.0) As the first attempt, Tyo et al. [41,76] designed a special sample, an aluminum target containing two abraded patches with orthogonal directions, to verify the effectiveness of PD imaging systems. This sample is placed in a tank with inside dimensions of 30 × 30 × 15 cm 3 . This tank is filled with water and milk to simulate the scattering environments. PS and PD images after being transformed for optimal display are shown in   Figure 4A. We can see that the abraded patches are clearly visible in the transformed PD image but practically invisible in the transformed PS image. The key factor contributing to the enhanced visibility of the two patches in the PD image is the common-mode rejection feature intrinsic to PD. Based on a series of validation, Tyo et al. [76] found that the PD imaging model is quite sensitive to intrinsically small signals and possesses valuable qualities of being passive, simple, and potentially fast.

(p7.1) This method does not employ polarized illumination, which makes it constantly suffer from a reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because light reflected from the target and diffusive light backscattered from the turbid medium are superposed. Guan et al. [42] developed the traditional model and added a linear polarizer behind the light source to generate a polarized illumination. By measuring the co-polarization (parallel to the incident light's polarization state) and cross-polarization (perpendicular to the incident light's polarization state) images, they obtain an improved PD image, expressed as I PDI I − I ⊥ . Figure 4B presents the comparison between PS and PD images. The result shows that the proposed method significantly suppresses the background noise, and the image contrast is improved approximately 1.7 times [42].
## (s9) Basic Model and Configuration
(p9.0) As the information dimension (number of polarization sub-images) in Stokes vector configurations is higher (i.e., three for linear Stokes and four for complete Stokes) than two in the PD imaging system, the Stokes vector is more suited for characterizing polarization properties of scattered light. In contrast, as the two important parameters (AoP and DoP), which are highly relevant to the scattered lights' properties [66,84], can be directly deduced from the Stokes parameters, introducing Stokes analysis into the scattering removal is promising.

(p9.1) According to the fundamental model in Eq. 1, we know that the estimation of transmittance t(x, y) depends on the scattering section A(x, y), where the polarization property can be characterized by the Stokes vector S A (x, y). Here, S A 0 is the captured intensity corresponding to A(x, y). In this way, Eq. 1 can be rewritten as

(p9.2) where S D (x, y) denotes the Stokes vector related to the direct transmission D(x, y). If the target objects are assumed unpolarized, S D (x, y) equals [D(x, y), 0, 0, 0] T ; conversely, S D (x, y) [D(x, y), S D 1 (x, y), S D 1 (x, y), S D 1 (x, y)] T , and the last three polarization parameters cannot be ignored. Based on the intensity measurements in different polarization states, we can estimate S A . Accordingly, we can obtain the A ∞ and t(x, y). In other words, the Stokes-based methods remove the veiling light by building the model between Stokes vectors (or the related polarization parameters) and (A ∞ , t(x, y)); that is,

(p9.3) where the parameters in Eq. 16 (i.e., P, P l , P c , and α) are defined in Eq. 7. The basic configuration of the Stokes-based methods can refer to that in Figure 2B2, and the specific choice depends on the used algorithm and realistic environments. According to the number of the used Stokes parameters, the methods can be classified as the linear-Stokes (LS) and the circular-Stokes (CS) based methods. In particular, for the LS-based methods, the PSA contains a fixed linear polarizer to generate polarized illumination, while the PSG contains a rotating linear polarizer. By adjusting the polarizer in PSG at least three times, we can obtain polarization sub-images. Based on these images, we can obtain a 1 × 3 linear Stokes vector. In contrast, in the CS-based methods, both PSG and PSA contain a linear polarizer and a retarder (e.g., QWP or liquid crystal variable retarders). By adjusting PSG's states at least four times and obtaining the related intensity images, we can get a 1 × 4 complete Stokes vector. The difference between the two systems is whether the circular component of the Stokes vector (i.e., S 3 ) is considered. However, the CS-based methods do not depend on the scattering angle and can survive more multi-scattering events than linearly polarized light [47,85,86]. Figures 7A,B present the DoP as a function of optical depth in water with different diameter particles, from which we can observe that the CP light maintains better polarization characteristics than linear polarization (LP) [47]. This property, the so-called circular polarization (CP) memory effect, can be explained by the Mie scattering phase functions of LP and CP. The phase function in the circular case possesses a marked forward lobule that permits the photons to propagate around the beam axis with a higher probability than in the linear case [87,88]. Figure 1B presents the effects of size on the DoP. Results show that when the size parameter is large, the DOP for CP is greater than that for LP [85]. The characteristics in Figure 7B attest to the superiority of CS-based methods in dense turbid water or underwater environments with large-sized particles. Besides, Sara et al. [89] quantitively demonstrated the superiority of circularly polarized light in foggy environments. The experiments are carried out at CEREMA's 30 m fog chamber under controlled fog density conditions. Figure 7C compares the ratio of CO channels (probe the prevalence of the input polarized light through the fog) with respect to the intensity signal as a function of the radius of the intensity profile of the source image for circular (solid lines) and linear (dashed lines) polarizations at three visibilities. The results imply that circular polarization has a larger signal-to-noise ratio in transmission at deeper layers, whereas the signal from the linearly polarized light carries some noise due to its higher depolarization ratio when propagating in scattering media.
## (s10) Representative Methods
(p10.0) To enhance the contrast, the two orthogonal polarized images in the traditional PD imaging model must be strictly selected to make the projections of the veiling light onto the two orthogonal axis directions equal [41]. However, this selection is time-consuming and inconvenient by rotating the polarizer mechanically, which is unsuitable for rapid imaging applications. Tian et al. optimized the traditional PD model to deal with this  limitation. They proposed a modified PD imaging method (M-PDI) based on the Stokes vector analysis of the veiling light [90]. The output image after removing the veiling light is expressed by

(p10.1) where α is the polarization orientation angle of the veiling light. The optimal value of α corresponds to the highest image contrast. A linear Stokes vector is calculated by capturing three images in polarizer's directions of 0, 45, and 90°and searching the optimal α. The significant advantage of this method is that the recovery performance can be updated automatically by the computation program when obtaining the Stokes parameters, which makes the implementation of PD imaging ideal for rapid imaging. Figures 8A-D show the recovery results of this method. The result shows the background noise is significantly suppressed, and the contrast of the target "Z" is significantly improved. In 2018, Guan et al. [91] modified the above method and proposed another M-PDI method via the Stokes vector-based interpolation method. Figure 8E compares the traditional and the modified polarization filtering methods in PD imaging. The principle of this method is shown in Figure 8F [91]. From the image results, the object's contrast is significantly enhanced, and the background noise is significantly decreased. More details of this method and the comparison with the traditional PD method can be found in [91].

(p10.2) Although the M-PDI method has partially addressed certain inherent drawbacks of the traditional model based on Stokes analysis, the determination of crucial parameters, based on the computational searching, makes the model performance unstable and sensitive to noise [38]. To overcome this issue, Liang et al. [38] further explored the relationship between the Stokes vector and veiling light and estimated the backscattering/air-light using the AoP analysis. Based on the three captured images on different polarizer directions (i.e., 0, 45, and 90°), the Stokes vector is calculated by the expressions in [38] S 0 I(0) + I(90)
## (s13) Representative Methods
(p13.0) The MM-based polarimetric suppression method for the imaging in scattering media is mainly based on modulating the polarization state of the active illumination. The earliest attempts focused on imaging linear MM and required nine intensity images [44,45,103]. In the related configurations, the WPs in PSG and PSA in Figure 2B2 are removed, and the polarizers in PSG and PSA are rotated to three different positions to capture nine images, respectively.

(p13.1) In 2019, Guan et al. [44] found that the illumination polarization angle and the MM difference between the medium and the object could affect the SNR of recovered results obtained by the rotation orthogonal polarization imaging method. They designed a linear MM-based polarimetric method to precisely control the illumination polarization angle and achieve a rapid imaging process. In 2021, Wang et al. [45] plotted backscattered light and target reflected light in the point cloud diagram in Figure 11A by establishing a differential imaging model. According to Figure 11A, on the premise that the angle between the polarizer's direction and the backscattering light's polarization direction is 45°, the backscattering light can be removed by the PD method to achieve scattering suppression. By analyzing the principle of polarization difference, the output result under ideal conditions is given by I out x, y I PB x, y − I PB⊥ x, y + I PT x, y − I PT⊥ x, y

(p13.2) where I PB (x, y), I PB⊥ (x, y), I PT (x, y), and I PT⊥ (x, y) represent the horizontal and vertical projection of the polarized part of the backscattering and target light, respectively. It can be seen from the above formula that the output result of the differential image will be affected by the polarization angle between the target and backscattered light. Therefore, by modulating the incident light and changing θ, the performance of the traditional PD method can be improved. Figure 11B presents the comparison results of this method with the traditional PD method and other classical methods. We see that the modulation of incident light has a significant influence on polarization differential scattering suppression. In other work, the authors disregard the traditional PD method and instead directly process the image according to the MM 45 . By modulating the polarization state of the incident active illumination light, the DoP of the backscattered light is directly maximized, thus achieving the best suppression of the backscattered light. Based on the configuration in Figure 2B2, one can obtain any specific polarized incident light by adjusting the PSG. The Stokes vector of the incident light S in can be expressed by its DoP value P, azimuth α, and ellipticity ε as follows:

(p13.3) where S in 0 denotes the intensity of the illustration light and S [ S in 1 , S in 2 , S in 3 ] is the normalized Stokes vector. When the DoP of backscattered light P back is higher, more backscattered light can be blocked by the PSA. Therefore, to suppress the backscattered light optimally, one must maximize the DoP of the backscattered light by choosing an optimal set of azimuths and ellipticities (α opt , ε opt ). This optimization problem can be expressed by
## (s17) Polarimetric Imaging Through Scattering Tissues
(p17.0) In the above sections, we have reviewed the polarimetric imaging through such scattering media as fog, haze, and turbid water. Meanwhile, biological tissues as another important scattering media and the related polarimetric imaging techniques have gained great attention in the biomedical field. To be more specific, the biological tissues contain fiber-like macromolecules (e.g., the collagen fibers in the skin and tendons, muscle fibers, and myofibrils in skeletal muscles), which exhibit a certain degree of structural anisotropy and anisotropy in dielectric response. These properties manifest themselves via birefringence [125,126], which can be observed using polarization measurement or polarimetric imaging [127]. For example, many works have shown that the depolarization, retardance, and diattenuation induced by the birefringent tissues can be considered indicators to assess macromolecules' microstructure, thus being conducive to diagnosis and the study of pathological alterations [128,129]. However, the scattering (especially the multiple scattering) in thick tissues often results in the depolarization of light, which makes detection of the remaining information-carrying polarization signals challenging. Therefore, various polarimetry or polarimetric imaging techniques have been developed to maximize measurement sensitivity to assist in analyzing useful tissue information [97,127,130,131].
