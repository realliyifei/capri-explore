## (s14) Conclusions
(p14.0) Sustainability should be a sine qua non for any type of venture, but studies show that, to be successful, sustainability in itself is not a unique selling point (Bocken, 2015). While it certainly is a catalyst towards legitimation, more is needed to enhance and maximize both, total and individual shareholder value. To that end, each shareholder, or potential stakeholder of the venture must be identified. Future research may study the different motivational factors for each stakeholder in relation to trust, sustainability and BT.

(p14.1) Moreover, stakeholders should be given clear cues and financial-sustainability education on the risks of ECF investments and about how their contributions to ventures embracing sustainability issues, matter to the universal good of our societies. Impact measurement and sustainability reporting in that realm will prove to be a powerful tool.
