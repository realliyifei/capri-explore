## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Solar energy is the most important energy resource to man and indeed it is essential factor for human life. Solar energy is the clean, abundant, renewable and sustainable energy resource from the sun which reaches the earth in form of light and heat. Solar energy occupies one of the most important places among the various possible alternative energy sources for both urban and rural areas. An accurate knowledge of the solar radiation distribution at a particular geographical location is of vital importance for the development of many solar energy devices and for estimates of their performance [1].

(p0.1) Solar radiation data may be considered as an essential requirement to conduct feasibility studies for solar energy systems. The knowledge of solar energy preferably gained over a long period should be useful not only to the locality where the radiation data is collected but for the wider world community [2]. In some developing countries, the facility for global radiation measurement is available at a few places while bright sunshine hours are measured at many locations. Some cannot even afford the equipment and techniques involved.
## (s4) Angstrom-Prescott Model
(p4.0) Angstrom was the first researcher that proposed a correlation for estimating monthly average daily global solar radiation in 1924 [7], who derived a linear relationship between the ratio of average daily global radiation to the corresponding value on a completely clear day (H/H c ) at a given location and the ratio of average daily sunshine duration to the maximum possible sunshine duration as:
## (s5) Rietveld Model
(p5.0) By analysis of measured data collected from 42stations located in different countries, Rietveld [17] proposed an unified correlation to compute the horizontal global solar radiation. The Rietveld model, which is claimed to be applicable anywhere in the world, is given in the following equation:
## (s8) Hargreaves and Samani Model
(p8.0) Maximum and minimum temperatures can also be used for estimation of monthly daily average solar radiation as recommended in 1982 by Hargreaves and Samani in the equation given below [21]: = 0< =>? − < =@ ) .
## (s15) Bahel Models
(p15.0) The world wide correlation for estimating monthly average daily global radiation based on bright sunshine hours and global radiation data of 48stations around the world, with varied meteorological conditions and a wide distribution of geographic locations was developed by Bahel [39]:
## (s22) Zabara Model
(p22.0) The correlated monthly 'a' and 'b' values of the Angstrom-Prescott model with monthly relative sunshine duration (S/S 0 ) as a third order function was derived by Zabara in 1986 as follows [45] 
## (s23) Gopinathan Model
(p23.0) Another author, Gopinathan [46] in 1988 suggested 'a' and 'b' regression coefficients of Angstrom-Prescott model as a function of elevation (Z) and sunshine ratio (S/S 0 ) for estimation of the global solar radiation as given below: 

(p23.1) Gopinathan [36] reported the following correlation for estimation of the global solar radiation: = −0.309 + 0.539 !"# − 0.0693F + 0.290 + 1.527 − 1.027 !"# + 0.0926F − 0.359 (56)
