## (s2) ACE related genes
(p2.0) The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in human circulatory homeostasis. One of the main components of the RAS is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which catalyses production of angiotensin II (ANG II) from angiotensin I (ANG I), consequently increasing blood pressure Furthermore, ACE is an essential part of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), where it degrades kinins into inactive fragments, thus reducing blood pressure [47,48].
## (s8) PPAR genes
(p8.0) Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-a) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) play an important role in muscle fibre type conversion [94,95]. PPARs are transcriptional factors which, through stimulation, affect glucose and fat metabolism [96], inflammatory vealed that the Gly/Gly genotype and the Gly allele of the PPARGC1A Gly482Ser polymorphism may facilitate athletic performance regardless of the type of sport [120].
## (s9) VEGFR2
(p9.0) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major growth polypeptide regulating skeletal muscle angiogenesis [121]. VEGF is associated with proportion of oxidative skeletal muscle fibres (type I) and maximal rate of oxygen consumption [122,123]. VEGF acts via two major receptors, VEGF1 and VEGFR2, localized mostly in the vascular endothelium [121].

(p9.1) The VEGFR2 gene is located on chromosome 4q11-q12. The rs1870377 T/A functional polymorphism in exon 11 results in the replacement of histidine (His) with glutamine (Gln) at the receptor within the extracellular region, which is important for ligand binding [124]. The frequency of the VEGFR2 472Gln allele was significantly higher in long, middle and short distance swimmers compared to controls [125]. In another study, Eider et. al [126] found that while the VEGFR2 gene Gln/Gln genotype was associated with endurance performance among Polish endurance athletes, including longdistance swimmers, when long-distance swimmers were separated from other endurance-type sports, no statistically significant difference between swimmers and controls was found.
## (s10) Actinin-3 (ACTN3) gene
(p10.0) The human ACTN3 gene encodes Î±-actinin-3, an actin-binding protein with a structural role at the sarcomeric Z-line in glycolytic (type II, fast-twitch) muscle fibres, and plays an important role in muscle metabolism regulation [127]. A common genetic SNP at codon 577 of ACTN3 (rs1815739) results in the replacement of arginine (R) with a stop codon (X) [128]. The R allele is the normal functional version of the gene, whereas the X allele contains a sequence change that completely stops production of a functional protein [128]. Therefore, ACTN3 knockout (KO) mouse exhibit reduced muscle mass, mainly due to the decreased diameter of fast muscle fibres, significant decrease in grip strength, higher endurance and a shift towards increased activity of the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism compared with wild-type mice [129,130].

(p10.1) A significant association between the ACTN3 genotype and athletic performance was first demonstrated by Yang et al. [131]. They showed that both male and female elite sprinters have significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele compared to controls. Since then, ACTN3 R577X has been studied in other cohorts such as rowers [132], soccer players [133], ironman triathletes [134], basketball [135] etc. Some articles have reported a strong association between the RR genotype and elite power performance [136][137][138][139].
## (s13) The IGF axis genes
(p13.0) The potential use of genetic SNP's of hormone genes as a tool to assist in predicting future athletic performance is currently an Genetic of swimming speed-related and not for strength sports. Circulating IGF2 levels were lower among individuals homozygous for the G allele [176], and higher levels of circulating IGF1 levels were found in individuals carrying the IGF2 GG genotype [177]. Thus, it is possible that the beneficial effect of the IGF2 rs680 polymorphism on speed performance is not necessarily mediated through its influence on circulating IGF2, but via its effect on IGF1 levels.
## (s16) Recovery related alleles that may be advantageous for tolerating water sports
(p16.0) genetically predisposed insulin-like growth factor system might also be disadvantageous for swimmers, mainly in the short distances [172]. Therefore, it is possible that carrying the IGFBP3C polymorphism serves as a compensation mechanism. Carriers of this polymorphism have lower circulating IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) levels. Therefore, levels of free IGF1, which is the actual bioactive growth factor, increase. The hypertrophic effect of higher free IGF1 levels may assist in the repair process of exercise-associated muscle damage. Again, this possible IGF-system compensating mechanism does not operate by inducing direct changes in IGF1, but instead by indirectly modifying its binding proteins.
