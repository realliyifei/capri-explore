## (s2) Motives And Economics
(p2.0) About 600 million computers are connected to the internet, of these computers 100-150 million are part of one or several Botnets. One Botnet alone was discovered to consist of about 1.5 million computers, when three Dutch botmasters were arrested for extorting a US company [15]. To illustrate the resources exploited by Botnets, a single Botnet was at one point using 15% of Yahoo's search capacity to create random e-mails to get past spam filters. According to an FBI projection, cybercrime robs U.S businesses for $67.2 billion a year. That amount of money is good motivation for doing any crime [9].
## (s3) Botnet Phenomenon
(p3.0) Botnets are emerging as the most significant threat facing online ecosystems and computing assets. Malicious Botnets are distributed computing platforms predominantly used for illegal activities such as launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, sending spam, trojan and phishing emails, illegally distributing pirated media and software, force distribution, stealing information and computing resource, ebussiness extortion, performing click fraud, and identity theft [5].

(p3.1) The high light value of Botnets is the ability to provide anonymity through the use of a multi-tier command and control (C&C) architecture. Moreover, the individual bots are not physically owned by the botmaster, and may be located in several locations spanning the globe. Differences in time zones, languages, and laws make it difficult to track malicious.
