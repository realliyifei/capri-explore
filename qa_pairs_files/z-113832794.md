## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) The growth of competition forces institutions to look for solutions in order to gain competitiveness. Innovation has been nominated as the driver of the economic growth. Innovation should not only be considered as "invention" or "R&D", but also as a systematic process [1]. A technological innovation system is a set of networks of actors and institutions that jointly interact in a specific technological field and contribute to the generation, diffusion and utilization of variants of a new technology and/or a new product [2].

(p0.1) Technology transfer has been characterized as adoption of innovation [3]. The transfer of technology has become a very effective way to disseminate innovation. Technology transfer has been emphasized as a challenging task and important driver in innovation and the creation of sustainable growth. The transfer of technology itself is the transfer of the ability to utilize and master of science and technology. The transfer of technology is an alternative to competitive for a work unit to search not only for the exploration of internal resources to take advantage of intellectual property as well as the results of research and development activities, but also for external partners to getting an increase in new technology to make it a new business opportunity in the form of start-up company [4].

(p0.2) The outputs of the technology transfer mechanisms range from intangible to tangible outcomes. Patenting, Licensing, and start-up are the most frequently discussed and relevant technology transfer methods in the literature, while a few studies emphasized the importance of other methods such as consulting, training, and exchange programs [5].
