## (s4) Parameters for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolic Biotransformation and Excretion
(p4.0) All parameters work together via equations.Likewise, all equations combined represent the structural bioaccumulation model (example of theoretical model in Noonburg et al. [27]).The outcome of such structural model is supposed to resemble the patterns in the data(sets).However, in order to do this, there are several processes in the overall kinetics of a chemical that need to be accounted for in a structural model.These processes are the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) processes [28].
## (s6) Distribution
(p6.0) The proportion of the absorbed chemical concentration ending up in a certain tissue depends on the physicochemical properties of the chemical, on the composition of that specific tissue (e.g., lipid content) compared to the blood and on the rate of blood flow to the tissue.The first and second can be deduced from the octanol/water partition coefficients (usually log K ow > 3 for hydrophobic compounds) and can be translated into partition or permeability coefficients [33], the third is a perfusion rate.The perfusion rate is calculated using the cardiac output, which is body weight dependent and species specific, multiplied by the percentage of the cardiac output that goes to the tissue of interest.Cardiac output can be found for marine mammal species that have been involved in studies concerning (deep) dive efforts (e.g., [34]), but there is a lack of information about the percentages of the cardiac output going into a specific tissue especially under varying levels of activity in free-ranging animals (e.g., rest versus diving versus active swimming).These percentages are therefore best taken from species other than marine mammals as a proxy (e.g., [26] for humans).For environmental contaminants, log K ow values are often available in the literature [33][34][35][36][37].In a specific tissue of interest, the kinetics of a chemical can be described by two types of processes: "diffusion-limited" and "flow-limited".In the former case, the blood flows freely and rapidly to the tissue so the rate-limiting process is the trans-membrane movement.In the latter case, the blood flow to the tissue is slow enough to be rate-limiting on itself.Both diffusion-limited and flow-limited distribution processes have been used in marine mammal bioaccumulation models to date (Table 1).
## (s8) Excretion
(p8.0) Excretion processes eliminate the chemical from the body.Depending on the chemical"s characteristics, this may occur in mammals through different pathways which are the lungs, kidneys, digestive tract and skin.In marine mammals, excretion through exhalation is not considered as having a major influence on their body burdens [12].Seals, as well as cetaceans, undergo periodic molting or sloughing of outer skin layers which could result in limited contaminant elimination.Corneocytes are keratinocytes in the last stage of differentiation located in the outermost skin layer which contain lipids and are surrounded by a lipid rich matrix.The sloughing or molting could therefore be a way for marine mammals to excrete lipophilic compounds.However, there is no information on whether the keratinocyte movements actually involve lipophilic compounds or on exchange rates that include the growth of the organism.Nevertheless, Hickie et al. [12] has indicated that dermal transfer is likely a minor pathway for hydrophobic chemicals that can be ignored for most purposes.
## (s10) Structure
(p10.0) Bioaccumulation models rely on an input and on ADME processes to generate an output.These three elements represent therefore the main structure of any bioaccumulation model.The input is the driving force that makes the bioaccumulation models run: without an input, the software is not likely going to give any output.As discussed earlier (Absorption), the most common pathway for marine mammals to absorb lipophilic chemicals is by ingestion of food (oral exposure).This automatically generates three important questions: (1) how much food does the animal require and acquire?(2) which food items are included in the diet for each species?(3) what are the concentrations of the compounds in these food items?

(p10.1) The first question can be interpreted from an energetic, as well as from a mass-related perspective.The animals obviously need a lot of energy for survival and reproduction and will attempt to adjust their dietary requirements accordingly.Establishing an input based on energetic requirements can be rather simple or more comprehensive.The fairly simple way can be found in Hickie et al. [12] where energy requirements were first calculated based on the animals size, growth rate, level of activity and reproductive effort (i.e., supporting gestation or lactation).This energy demand was then converted into a feeding rate, taking into account the average digestibility of the food and its energy content (e.g., fish was assumed to be composed of 15% protein with an energy content of 5650 kcal/kg).A set of similar calculations were used for nursing calves to estimate the energy and volume of milk they require which was then added to the energy requirements of the mother.One of the most sensitive and uncertain parameters in this approach has to do with the selection of the factor that accounts for the "field metabolic rate" which can be estimated as a multiplication of the estimated resting metabolic rate.
## (s12) Bioaccumulation Models: Statistical Supplementation
(p12.0) The goal of a model is to show a simplified version of a usually very complex reality.Clearly, this complexity can cause some uncertainty and variability that should be addressed in a statistically sound manner [54].Though there are several statistical methods employed for parameter estimation to minimize uncertainty and variability, the most recent and advanced one is the Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations (Figure 3).This approach is a way to explore the parameter probability distribution created by the variation in parameter values around a certain parameter distribution [54].Especially in uncontrolled environments as encountered with wild animal populations, parameters tend to have ranges of potential values instead of single and fixed values.The role of the Bayesian approach with MCMC is to test all possible parameter values in the overall parameter space in order to come up with parameter values or (smaller) ranges.These posterior values or ranges are more meaningful to describe a specific dataset and by extension also the population where the dataset was taken from.The Bayesian approach allows the inclusion of prior knowledge of the parameters and is therefore totally different from any frequentist approach [55].This prior knowledge can relate to specific parameter values or parameter ranges taken from the literature, even from other species, or updated results of previous model runs.Bayes" theorem is based on:

(p12.1) where d stands for the data, θ for the parameter values, p(θ|d) for the posterior distribution of the parameters given the data, p(θ) for the prior distribution of the parameters and p(d|θ) the likelihood of the data given the parameters [55].If the prior distribution of the parameters is uninformative, this method will give the same parameter means as the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which is a frequentist approach as used in the bioaccumulation model for bottlenose dolphins [7].

(p12.2) Monte Carlo is an efficient numerical way to repeatedly draw samples from a (prior) distribution in order to estimate averages and variances, thus posterior parameter distributions.Combined with Bayes" theorem, this prior distribution is formed by the likelihood of the data given the parameters and the prior knowledge of the data.Markov chains are applied to optimize the "repeatedly drawing samples" part inasmuch that every drawing depends on the immediately preceding one thereby creating chains.The impact of Markov chains on the Monte Carlo method is thus that the posterior parameter distribution is going to be different and narrower if the prior parameter knowledge is sufficiently informative (Figure 3).
