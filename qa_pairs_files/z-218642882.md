## (s22) Strengths and Limitation.
(p22.0) Following is the brief summary of the present research: (1) comprehensive search strategies were applied to seven databases to ensure that all relevant reviews were identified; (2) before assessment, we   Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine have systematically learned some related courses on methodology and reporting evaluation and consulted relevant methodological experts, professors so as to gain deep understanding, and ensure the accuracy of the evaluation process; (3) during the process, we adopted AMSTAR 2 and PRISMA to evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of the qualified studies, and we combined PRISMA-A to the part of abstract in PRISMA, thus making the evaluation more precise; (4) we excluded the overlapping RCTs and conducted a quantitative analysis of the primary RCTs, with the help of the GRADE approach so as to evaluate the quality of the outcomes with different comparisons; (5) Cochrane Collaboration guidelines were followed for data synthesis. More than two reviewers were engaged so as to minimize potential bias in the overview process.

(p22.1) ere are some limitations in the present study: (1) e methodological quality of both included SRs and primary RCTs was not high, and the quality of evidence for the outcomes was unsatisfactory; thus, the conclusions from this          applied to all kinds of RCTs, and they include some characteristic guidelines such as STRICTA (Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture) [50] and STRICTOM ( e Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials Of Moxibustion) [51] for acupuncture and moxibustion, independently. PRISMA is used for SR and MA. (3) We also recommend GRADE approach to assess the evidence quality of the more SRs in the future. (4) e primary RCTs should give more attention to blinding, allocation concealment, and registration, which could result in more reliable evidence.
