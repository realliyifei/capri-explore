## (s2) II. METHOD
(p2.0) Research related to electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely done by many researchers. From the researcher's research, ECG research has been conducted by Pan and Tompkins [6]. Furthermore, many researchers who conducted ECG research also such as [7] whose research related to heart abnormalities arrhythmia using fuzzy logic method. Various method approaches are used to obtain a good end result, such as fuzzy, wavelet, machine learning or statistical methods [8]. There are even those who use tools (CSA) on Linux [9]. In this study, researchers tried to conduct research in terms of literature studies related to electrocardiograms (ECG).

(p2.1) Researchers began tracing literature studies related to journals that discussed ECG and used wavelet methods. ECG research using wavelets is spread in the journals of several disciplines such as computer science, electrical engineering, applied sciences, and others. Searches were conducted on several publication database sites published from 2011 to 2020 with the keyword "ECG Wavelet", and restricted to the field of Computer Science.
