## (s3) MSI and Chemotherapy
(p3.0) For many years, chemotherapy was the only treatment option for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. It has been well-established that MSI/dMMR status is a good prognostic factor for patients with early-stage (II-III) colorectal cancer [173][174][175][176]. Although, it was subsequently confirmed that while MSI status seems to be a good prognostic factor in low-risk stage III patients (T1-3, N1), it is no longer so in high-risk stage III patients (T4 and/or N2) [177,178]. For patients with stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer, the prognostic impact of MSI status, on the contrary, becomes worse than for those with an MSS tumor [121].
## (s12) Tumor Types other Than Colorectal
(p12.0) The second most common cancer with high prevalence of the MSI phenotype is endometrial carcinoma (EC). The efficacy of pembrolizumab for the treatment of metastatic MSI EC was established in the KEYNOTE-158 trial. In the pretreated patients (n = 79), the ORR was 48%, median PFS was 13.1 months, and median OS was not reached [220]. Pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib showed a numerically lower ORR in the KEYNOTE-775 trial. The study evaluated the efficacy of this combination in patients with pretreated EC with or without dMMR. In the dMMR cohort (n = 65), the ORR was 40%, compared to 12% in the chemotherapy cohort (n = 65) [221]. In the pMMR cohort (n = 346), the ORR was 30% in the experimental group and 15% in the chemotherapy group (n = 351) [221].
## (s13) Mechanisms of Resistance to ICI
(p13.0) As previously shown, a significant proportion of MSI patients do not respond to ICI therapy. About 25% of MSI CRC cases have intrinsic resistance to immunotherapy [43]. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observation.
