## (s1) Gastric Cancer
(p1.0) Gastric cancer (GC) ranked fifth in worldwide cancer incidence (1,089,103 new cases) and third in cancer-related mortality (768,793 mortalities) in the year 2020 [1]. Risk factors for GC include lifestyle modifiers such as dietary habits and smoking, family history, and socioeconomic status [16][17][18]. In addition, infection with Helicobacter pylori and EBV have also been reported to be risk factors for the occurrence of GC [19]. H. pylori infection is attributed to almost all GC cases; EBV contributes to less than 10% of incidences [20,21]. 
## (s2) Gastric Cancer
(p2.0) Gastric cancer (GC) ranked fifth in worldwide cancer incidence (1,089,103 new cases) and third in cancer-related mortality (768,793 mortalities) in the year 2020 [1]. Risk factors for GC include lifestyle modifiers such as dietary habits and smoking, family history, and socioeconomic status [16][17][18]. In addition, infection with Helicobacter pylori and EBV have also been reported to be risk factors for the occurrence of GC [19]. H. pylori infection is attributed to almost all GC cases; EBV contributes to less than 10% of incidences [20,21].
## (s3) Helicobacter pylori
(p3.0) Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium that could be isolated from the upper gastrointestinal tract of more than 50% of the population [22]. It can be transmitted through saliva, vomit material, and feces [23]. The bacteria's chemotaxis properties allow it to detect pH changes in the stomach and subsequently burrow into the epithelial layer to escape the acidic mucosal lining [24]. In addition, H. pylori secrete urease which breaks down gastric urea to produce carbon dioxide and ammonia, neutralizing the acidic pH of the environment [25]. While these properties allow the bacteria to survive in the stomach and duodenum, the production of ammonia is toxic to host epithelial cells, whereby long-term colonization of H. pylori causes inflammation and results in chronic gastritis [26,27].

(p3.1) For hosts who carry the cag pathogenicity island (PAI)-positive H. pylori, secreted CagA disrupts cellular processes and host cell gene transcription via tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and kinases, causing neoplastic morphological changes and cell proliferation [28][29][30]. At the same time, the type IV secretion system expressed by cag PAI injects bacterial peptidoglycan into gastric epithelial cells, stimulating cytokine expression and further inflammation [31]. In addition, 50% of all H. pylori strains secrete VacA, a virulence factor that induces epithelial cell vacuolization and inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation, aiding the bacteria's gastric colonization and leading to peptic ulceration [29,32]. Subsequently, if lifestyle or genetic risk factors are present, for hosts who are low acid producers, gastric cancer might occur, while high acid producers might develop duodenal cancer [33]. Association of H. pylori and gastric inflammation has been reported since 1982, and the bacteria was later categorized as a group I (definite) carcinogen by the IARC in 1994 [34,35].
## (s6) Hepatitis Virus
(p6.0) There are five hepatitis viruses (A-E); two of them, hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV), are associated with HCC [56]. Despite their tropism for the liver, HBV and HCV are from different families, namely, Hepadnaviridae for HBV and Flaviviridae for HCV. The HBV genome consists of double-stranded DNA with reverse transcriptase, while HCV is a single-strand RNA virus. These two viruses are transmitted through blood. Nevertheless, HBV can also spread via body fluids during sexual intercourse or vertical mother-toinfant transmission [60].

(p6.1) Epidemiological studies suggest chronic HBV infection as the main risk factor in HCC development [61][62][63], where low copy numbers of the virions are sufficient to initiate infection [64]. Once it enters the host, the virus makes its way to the liver, binds to hepatocytes via the NTCP (sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide) receptor, enters the cell via endocytosis, and proceeds to the nucleus [65]. Viral DNA transcription and protein translation are then initiated [63]. During active infection, the newly generated viral DNA will be integrated into the host genome, leading to chromosomal instability (CIN), insertional mutagenesis, and cis-activation of tumor-associated genes. Interestingly, no consistent singular target gene for HBV DNA integration has been identified; though pathways associated with AKT activation, mitotic cell cycle, AXIN1, and DNA imprinting have been reported to be dysregulated by the infection [59]. In addition, binding of the Hepatitis B X protein (HBx), to the host genome changes the expression of miRNAs and further disrupts histone methyltransferases activity, leading to cell expression pattern changes in HCC pathophysiology [66,67]. In addition, although the full extent of Hepatitis D virus (HDV)-associated HCC pathogenesis remains to be investigated, studies so far have found that co-infection of the virus with HBV will increase hepatocyte necro-inflammation, leading to cirrhosis and HCC [68,69].

(p6.2) In chronic HBV infection, the host experiences phases of "immune tolerance," "immune reactive," "inactive carrier," "chronic hepatitis," and "HBV surface antigen-negative" [70]. The risk for HCC is higher at both "immune reactive" and "chronic hepatitis" phases. During the "immune reactive" phase, the virus infects hepatocytes and integrates into host DNA. Subsequently, during "chronic hepatitis," HBV replication is lowered, allowing viral mutants to escape host immune response. Nevertheless, this will still drive inflammation and hepatitis progression in the host via continuous activation of impaired anti-viral immune response, which in turn exacerbates inflammation and hepatocyte turnover, causing clonal expansion of premalignant cells containing HBV-integrated host DNA and HCC [71].

(p6.3) Compared to HBV infection, HCV does not integrate into the host genome. There are two phases of HCV infection: acute and chronic [59]. The risk for HCC increases during the chronic phase, and may increase as much as 17-fold [72]. The virus is transcribed once it reaches and enters the host's hepatocytes [73,74]. HCV viral factors are then implicated in the interference of a variety of molecular pathways, including cell metabolism, genetic repair, apoptosis, and induction of ROS activity [75].
## (s7) Aspergillus spp.
(p7.0) Two species from the Aspergillus fungus, namely Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus produce the genotoxic compound aflatoxin, which can be found in improperly stored food crops, such as rice, wheat, millet, corn, and peanuts [82][83][84]. The toxin, when ingested via food supplies, may cause acute aflatoxin poisoning and lead to abdominal pain and vomiting. Serious cases of acute exposure have been reported to cause pulmonary edema, fatty liver, liver necrosis, and even death [85]. Intriguingly, the toxin has a tropism for the liver, where chronic exposure to the toxin has been proven to increase HCC risk in humans and many species of animals. Epidemiologically, aflatoxin exposure is linked to HCC in many West African countries due to inappropriate post-harvest processing; in addition, developing countries have a higher incidence rate, where low-income populations sometimes resort to long-term consumption of moldy food produce to avoid starvation [86][87][88].

(p7.1) Although there are four aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2), AFB1 is the most common and has been strongly associated with HCC [85]. Once ingested, AFB1 will find its way to the liver and is subsequently activated by microsomal enzymes, forming DNA adducts of trans-8, 9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 (AFB1-N7-dG), and trans-8, 9-dihydro-8-(2, 6-diamino-4-oxo-3, 4-dihydropyrimid-5-yl-formamido) -9hydroxy aflatoxin B1 (AFB1-Fapy-dG) [89]. AFB1-N7-dG has been reported to cause G > T mutagenesis [90], while AFB1-Fapy-dG may cause all G > T, G > A, G > C and single nucleotide deletions in p53 [91,92]. In addition to the formation of DNA adducts, AFB1 has also been found to cause mutations (AGG > AGT) at codon 249 of p53, leading to arginine substitution with serine (R249S) [92,93]. Hosts without proficient nucleotide or base excision repair mechanisms, together with by-pass by the error-prone DNA polymerase Î¶ during DNA replication will lead to clonal expansion of hepatocytes with p53 allelic deletions. Coupled with chronic inflammation due to HBV or HCV infections, chronic hepatitis and/or liver cirrhosis will occur, with HCC as a sequela.
## (s9) Opisthorchis viverrini
(p9.0) Opisthorchis viverrini was first discovered in Southeast Asia in 1886 in a fish by the parasitologist Jules Poirier [97]; it is prevalent in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. It is a monoecious hermaphrodite [98] and requires three different hosts (two intermediate and one definitive) to complete its life cycle. O. viverrini miracidia larvae infect freshwater snails (Bithynia spp.) and grow into sporocysts in snail tissues. These sporocysts become cercaria larvae, escape from snail tissues, and migrate towards fish, their second intermediate host. The flukes will then develop into metacercaria in the flesh of the fish. Ingestion of raw, contaminated fish frees O. viverrini into their final host, where they migrate towards the biliary tree and dominate the bile duct [99,100]. The flukes then cause CCA via three mechanisms: mechanical and chronic injury to biliary epithelial cells, immunologic inflammation via release of reactive oxygen intermediates and nitric oxide, and host cell proliferation via parasite secretion products. In chronic infection, these will cause DNA damage to the host cells and lead to tumorigenesis [101].
## (s10) Clonorchis sinensis
(p10.0) Clonorchis sinensis, the Chinese liver fluke, is mainly found in East Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, Korea, and Northern Vietnam [108]. Like O. viverrini, the parasite is digenetic, with snails and cyprinid fish as intermediate hosts. It shares a similar mechanism of infection and carcinogenesis as O. viverrini-by causing mechanical damage and chemical irritation to its host.

(p10.1) In addition to mechanical damage, feeding of the frequently propagating parasites at the bile ducts serves as mechanical obstruction, leading to metaplasia of the biliary epithelial cells. These cells will transform into mucin-producing cells that produce excretorysecretory products (ESPs) and mucus in the bile [109]. At the same time, the presence of the parasite at the biliary tree is recognized by host TLR-2 and -4, resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These peptides were originally intended for fluke elimination, however, they now contribute towards disease progression, causing toxicity towards the host, and cholangiocyte damage [110].
## (s11) Colorectal Cancer
(p11.0) Colorectal cancer (CRC) has affected more than 1.9 million people worldwide in the year 2020 with 935,173 mortalities [1]. While diet such as frequent red meat consumption and family history were reported to be associated with CRC, gut microbiome dysbiosis was recently identified as a risk factor for CRC [116]. Several bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Streptococcus bovis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum have been reported to have a higher abundance in CRC patients. Among them, F. nucleatum has been suggested as a potential microbial carcinogen that initiates the development of CRC [117,118].
## (s12) Fusobacterium nucleatum
(p12.0) Fusobacterium nucleatum are anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria that were first isolated from the oral cavity. With the advent of gut microbiome profiling, it was discovered that the bacteria can also colonize human intestines [119]; nevertheless, the movement of F. nucleatum from the mouth to colon remains unclear. In 2013, Kostic et al. proved that infection by F. nucleatum increases tumor cell multiplicity and recruits tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in an in vivo model. Accordingly, carcinogenic properties of the bacteria were then reported, where the bacteria were found to enhance the proliferation of normal human colon cells, subsequently triggering the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway [120].

(p12.1) Fusobacterium nucleatum contributes toward the development of CRC via a few pathways. The bacteria attach and invade colon endothelial cells via the FadA adhesion protein. This causes the secretion of cytokines (IL-6, 8, 10, 18; TNF-Î±) and the expression of NF-ÎºB, creating a pro-inflammatory environment in the colon [121]. At the same time, macrophage infiltration and methylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, CDKN2A [122] occurs in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, FadA binding of the host cell E-cadherin receptor activates Î²-catenin signaling. This promotes tumor cell proliferation via increased expression of oncogenes of the Wnt pathway and their transcription factors [118]. Chronic infection activates the p38 gene which is crucial in the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -9, and -13 for invasion as well as metastasis properties [123]. Besides FadA, F. nucleatum harbors another virulence factor, Fap2, which binds to TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor on T cells and natural killer cells, protecting tumor cells from the host immune system. Indeed, the bacteria were found to inhibit human T-cell responses toward mitogens and antigens (immunosuppressive activities) [124], most probably via blockage of the cell cycle mid-G1 phase [125].

(p12.2) Of note, in the case of CRC, cross-talk between microbial species might be important in causing cancer. Other than F. nucleatum, bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Parvimonas micra, and Akkermansia muciniphila have been found to be over-represented in the gut mucosa of CRC patients [126][127][128][129]. The exact role of these bacteria in CRC pathogenesis, however, remains to be investigated.
## (s13) Bladder Cancer
(p13.0) In 2020, more than 573,000 cases of urinary bladder carcinoma were newly reported worldwide, followed by 212,536 mortalities [1]. The cancer includes urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma; some can involve more than one cell type. In many parts of the world, squamous cell carcinoma can be caused by chronic irritation to the bladder as a result of prolonged urinary catheter usage. Nevertheless, in the Middle East and Africa regions, the cancer is associated with urogenital schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium parasites [130].
## (s15) Cervical Cancer
(p15.0) Cervical cancer is mostly diagnosed among women at the age of 35 to 44 years old. It is the fourth most frequent cancer reported globally with 604,127 cases in 2020 [1]. The burden of cervical cancer faced by low-and middle-income countries is significantly greater than in high-income countries, and contributed to 341,831 deaths in 2020 [1,149]. Interestingly, cervical cancer is usually caused by infectious agents, namely the human papillomavirus (HPV). Co-infections by Chlamydia trachomatis can initiate chronic infection on the endocervical cells at the transformation zone, which exposes the cells to oncogenic HPV infections [150].
## (s16) Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
(p16.0) Human Papillomavirus is considered the principal etiological agent [151] and classified as a carcinogen for cervical cancer. There are currently more than 200 HPV subtypes, where they are classified as group I, IIA, IIB, and III carcinogens by the IARC. Amongst the HPV subtypes, HPV 16 and HPV 18 have been described as potential human carcinogens since 1983 [152]. Risk factors for HPV-associated cervical cancer include smoking and sexual exposure with multiple sexual partners, where these partners in turn, also have multiple partners [153].
## (s18) Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV)/Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)
(p18.0) Following the discovery of its genome sequences in biopsies, KSHV was identified as the causative agent for KS (IARC Class I carcinogen) [167]. The virus is a gammaherpesvirus with five major subtypes (A, A5, B, C, and D). Interestingly, the virus encodes proteins homologous to its human host, such as cyclin, viral FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP), B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), IL-6, interferon regulatory factors, and chemokines, where viral cyclin and vFLIP promote the proliferation of infected tumor cells during latent infection [164]. Besides KS, KSHV is also associated with Castleman's disease and primary effusion lymphoma, both neoplasms of the lymphatic system.
