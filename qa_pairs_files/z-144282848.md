## (s2) Addressing the negative impacts of urban freight transport
(p2.0) A variety of negative social, environmental and economic impacts of urban freight transport can be targeted by policy makers.These include traffic congestion, local air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, noise disturbance, and safety.In attempting to reduce the scale of these negative impacts, policy makers can implement a range of initiatives that are intended to alter urban freight operations.Some of these initiatives will only address a single impact, while others will address several impacts at the same time.

(p2.1) Features of urban freight transport that can be altered in order to reduce negative impacts are shown in Figure 1 together with the negative impacts they are related to. Figure 1 shows that the total vehicle kilometres (and journeys) travelled are the feature of urban freight transport with connections to the greatest number of negative impacts (it is related to all the negative impacts).Various initiatives have been implemented in different cities across the world [3].The following sections of this paper review the initiatives implemented by city authorities to reduce social and environmental impacts of urban freight transport in the following countries/cities: London, UK; Yokahama, Japan; Utrecht, the Netherlands; and a number of cities in France.
