## (s4) DAC Technology
(p4.0) With well-configured installation, DAC demonstrates the remarkable capability to generate pressures as high as 550 GPa.It surpasses the pressure at the core of the Earth, indicating that DAC has the potential to replicate the majority of pressure-induced processes occurring on Earth.This exceptional tool has gained global popularity due to its compact size, ease of operation, and safety.As shown in Figure 1, DAC consists of a pair of diamond anvils along with external mechanical components [46].The diamond possesses a unique combination of mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, chemical, and other qualities, making it an outstanding choice for an anvil.A sealing gasket is positioned between the two anvil faces.The gasket features a cylindrical hole at its center, serving as a dedicated sample chamber.The sealing gasket has two functions: it alters the stress distribution and seals the sample.Gasket materials include T301 steel, rhenium, titanium, and copper.To ensure a uniform compression of the sample within the DAC, pressure mediums are essential for transmitting pressure and maintaining a hydrostatic pressure field.Pressure transmitting mediums generally follow specific requirements, including no chemical reactivity with the sample, efficient pressure transmission, and good temperature stability.Table 1 provides a comprehensive overview of various pressure-transmitting materials, highlighting the unique characteristics related to each group.Monitoring and calibrating the applied pressure is a crucial step in highpressure experiments.Ruby is widely regarded as the ideal choice due to it exhibiting strong fluorescence when subjected to laser excitation, and its luminescence spectrum exhibits a distinct peak that consistently varies in response to applied pressure.

## (s5) In Situ High-Pressure Measurement
(p5.0) In situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a valuable technique for investigating material structures under extreme pressure conditions, providing compelling evidence of phase transitions [52,53].Compared to the XRD analysis at ambient conditions, in situ XRD presents many challenges, including the limited size of the sample chamber, the absorption of X-rays by the diamond anvils, and the constrained numerical aperture of the DAC.These problems have been effectively improved with the development of synchrotron radiation technology.Meanwhile, researchers have developed devices with specific geometries to overcome the numerical aperture limitations, although these mechanical changes reduce the maximum pressure which can be achieved.

(p5.1) Raman spectroscopy is particularly sensitive to various factors, including the polarization and orientation of the incident light, the crystal symmetry and orientation of the solid sample, and the direction and polarization of the scattered light.Under high-pressure conditions, the in situ Raman spectroscopy technique can provide valuable insights into the strength of chemical bonds, the coefficient of thermal expansion and compression, and the chemical processes or phase transitions.In particular, this method excels in monitoring the interlayer sliding phenomena due to its ability to effectively measure the impact of pressure on the covalent bonds within the material (high-frequency Raman vibrations) and the spacing between layers (low-frequency Raman vibrations).However, it is worth noting that Raman scattering often exhibits relatively low intensity.To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, various strategies can be used, including extending the integration time, conducting multiple scans, refining the oscillator, and implementing additional signal filtering.

## (s7) Phase Transition of Bulk SnSe
(p7.0) Chattopadhyay et al. conducted a preliminary investigation via energy dispersive Xray diffraction techniques to examine the behavior of SnSe, which revealed that the layered crystal structure exhibited stability up to a pressure of 34 GPa [59].Peters and McNeil et al. observed structural modifications in SnSe under pressures ranging from 1.4 to 3 GPa using Mossbauer measurements [57].These changes were attributed to the interlayer interactions, prompting the transition from a pseudo 2D structure to a 3D structure.Importantly, the structural characteristics of the Pnma space group were maintained during this transformation.In contrast, Alptekin et al. theoretically determined that a transition from the orthorhombic Pnma phase to the Cmcm phase occurs at 7 GPa [60].Loa et al. utilized angle-dispersive synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (ADXRD) to investigate the behavior of SnSe under pressure up to 10.5 GPa.They observed SnSe undergo a second-order phase transition from the orthorhombic Pnma structure to Bbmm, which is similar to Cmcm.This study represents the first instance of experimental evidence that supports the presence of a structural phase transition in bulk SnSe [61].Pal et al. also observed the structural phase transition in bulk SnSe through Raman scattering.As shown in Figure 3, two new modes (M8, M9) at 81.2 and 144.6 cm −1 emerged in the Raman spectra at 6.2 GPa and persisted up to 21 GPa, which is associated with the phase transition [62].observed structural modifications in SnSe under pressures ranging from 1.4 to 3 GPa using Mossbauer measurements [57].These changes were attributed to the interlayer interactions, prompting the transition from a pseudo 2D structure to a 3D structure.Importantly, the structural characteristics of the Pnma space group were maintained during this transformation.In contrast, Alptekin et al. theoretically determined that a transition from the orthorhombic Pnma phase to the Cmcm phase occurs at 7 GPa [60].Loa et al. utilized angledispersive synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (ADXRD) to investigate the behavior of SnSe under pressure up to 10.5 GPa.They observed SnSe undergo a second-order phase transition from the orthorhombic Pnma structure to Bbmm, which is similar to Cmcm.This study represents the first instance of experimental evidence that supports the presence of a structural phase transition in bulk SnSe [61].Pal et al. also observed the structural phase transition in bulk SnSe through Raman scattering.As shown in Figure 3, two new modes (M8, M9) at 81.2 and 144.6 cm −1 emerged in the Raman spectra at 6.2 GPa and persisted up to 21 GPa, which is associated with the phase transition [62].

## (s19) Thermoelectric Properties of SnSe under High Pressure
(p19.0) For decades, the primary strategies for enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) have been the adjustment of carrier concentration to improve the power factor and the reduction in thermal conductivity [120,121].SnSe has demonstrated an exceptionally high ZT value of 2.6 ± 0.3 at 923 K [29].However, ZT value remains low below 800 K, limiting practical efficiency.Significant progress has been achieved through the application of various external factors, such as pressure or stress, to enhance the ZT value in existing thermoelectric materials [122][123][124][125].

## (s20) Anisotropic Thermoelectric Properties
(p20.0) In the early days, considerable attention was drawn to the remarkable thermoelectric properties of SnSe [58,126].Zhao et al. reported remarkably elevated ZT values for singlecrystalline SnSe at 923 K [29].It was as high as 2.6 ± 0.3 along the b-axis, 2.3 ± 0.3 along the c-axis, and 0.8 ± 0.2 along the a-axis.Carrete et al. observed the lattice thermal conductivity (κl) with κl b > κl c > κl a at all temperatures by theoretical calculation [127].Ibrahim et al. reported that κl presents an expressive anisotropy among the three directions (κl c > κl b > κl a ) in undoped single-crystalline SnSe [128].

(p20.1) Zhang et al. predicted the ZT values of P-type SnSe along the b-and c-axis can reach 2.5 and 1.7 at 6 GPa and 700 K, respectively.However, the a-axis showed N-type SnSe with ZT value of 1.7 at 6 GPa and 600 K.The improvement in thermoelectric properties can be attributed to the alteration of electronic structures under pressure [129].Gusãmo et al. investigated the impact of pressures (0−10 GPa) on the thermoelectric properties of Pnma-

## (s23) Doping-induced Enhancement of Thermoelectric Properties
(p23.0) Doping is a process that involves introducing small quantities of other elements or compounds into a material, in order to enhance their properties or to induce specific electrical, thermoelectric, and optical characteristics.

(p23.1) Qin et al. discovered that the thermoelectric performance of P-type SnSe single crystals can be significantly improved through Te alloying [133].An exceptionally high ZT value of 2.1 at 793 K was reported.Zhang et al. successfully synthesized polycrystalline SnSe 1-x Te x (x = 0.02, 0.03, and 0.05) samples [108].As shown in Figure 14a-c, the power factor initially increases with pressure, indicating a significant reduction in electrical resistivity.
