## (s7) Freeze Thawing
(p7.0) This technique involves simultaneous crystallization and agglomeration processes in single step which has been efficaciously used for enhancement of flowability and similarity of excipients [10]. Additionally numerous biotech items are effectively put away in the frozen state [20].
## (s10) Solvent Evaporation
(p10.0) This process involves microencapsulating the main excipient material by dissolving or dispersing it in the polymer coating solution. Further by agitation process the core material blend is distributed all over the vehicle phase to get the proper size and shape microcapsules. Then heating the above mixture results in evaporation of the solvent. On evaporation of the solvent, the liquid vehicle temperature is decreased to ambient room temperature by continuous agitation process. The core excipient materials can be either water insoluble or watersoluble materials [23]. This process is used in preparation of liquid manufacturing vehicles. The coating excipient is solubilized in a volatile solvent, which is immiscible with the liquid manufacturing vehicles [16].
## (s14) Regulatory Considerations
(p14.0) Before getting introduced in the market, every novel excipient needs to go through a few administrative endorsements and toxicological examinations to confirm safety and effectiveness. The FDA necessitates that NDA (new drug applications) and ANDA (abbreviated new drug applications) applicants give data about all constituents of the drugs as well as all excipients used. This information involves data of its composition, analytical techniques used, along with the safety. New excipients must be properly scrutinized for pharmacological action as per the ICH guidelines. These assessments can be performed through toxicological evaluations. By detailed investigations of co-processed excipients, it had observed and proved that the included excipients do not lead to any chemical changes after coprocessing, these co-processed excipients are considered as safe if the parent excipients are like wise Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS)-certified by regulatory authorities and hence these excipients need not to undergo any further regulatory approval and toxicological evaluations. Guidelines expresses that when any one or both of the excipients used in coprocessing are official in any compendia, then these excipients used will follow all the standards stated in its monograph [31]. But if one of the excipients is non compendial or it is a novel excipient then, it must be regarded as a new chemical entity which will be then subjected for detailed toxicological studies.
## (s15) Marketing
(p15.0) Authorization should be referenced.  As per latest European guidelines, when a novel excipient is used in a drug formulation it must undergo detailed toxicological studies as that of an API [30] The blend of excipients was introduced as a subject to the National Formulary and was allocated an importance based on the usage of the blend in marketed formulation in which the processing has given an increased value to the excipient mixture. In this way, there is a need for an administrative dossier inside the EU region for any novel excipients [24].
