## (s1) Zinc as a therapy
(p1.0) Various forms of zinc have been used as a mode of therapy either in topical or oral forms. Topical preparations like zinc oxide, calamine, or zinc pyrithione have been in use as photoprotecting, soothing agents or as an active ingredient of antidandruff shampoos. The use of zinc is well established in acrodermatitis enteropathica, but over the years use of zinc has been expanded in various disorders. 4 In this article we have highlighted the various dermatological uses of zinc therapy.

(p1.1) Acrodermatitis Enteropathica: It is a rare congenital form of zinc deficiency. The clinical manifestations of this disease usually start following weaning from breast feeding, when the protective effect of the Zn binding ligand from the mother's milk is no longer present. They include growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, and characteristic cutaneous lesions involving acral, periorificial, and anogenital areas, 5 treatment with oral zinc (2-3 mg/kg/day) will cure all clinical manifestations within 1-2 weeks and needs to be continued up to adulthood for continuous supplementation and favorable long-term prognosis. 4
