## (s1) AI, POWER-TO-X, AND ENERGY SYSTEMS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW
(p1.0) For this paper, we carried out a systematic literature review using specific keywords and phrases in our search within reputable scientific databases available on the web, including: University Library Databases, Emerald Insight, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ResearchGate, Academia.eduand Google Scholar.Moreover, relevant books on topics relating to the focus of the research projects as well as professionals and academics working in the filed have also been discovered via an Amazon.comand a LinkedIn search.We used the search terms "AI"þ "Power-to-X"þ"sustainability"þ"digital technologies"þ"risk"þ"challenges" several times between June and December 2022 to identify relevant contributions to be included in the review.We followed a multi-stage process, involving planning the review via the identification of possible data sources and focusing only on articles published between 2014 and 2022, due to the novelty of the topic at hand.Initial findings involved a detailed analysis of the papers identified across the several databases, in order to appraise their quality and relevance.280 unique works and case studies were analysed overall.Of these, 75 were most closely related to the synthesis presented as part of the paper's detailed analysis and discussion.

(p1.1) The following categories were identified in relation to the integration of AI, smart sustainable technologies and controls as a way to achieve energy efficiency globally: electricity production, power delivery, electric distribution networks, energy storage, energy saving, new energy materials and devices, energy efficiency and nanotechnology, energy policy and economics, future energy systems with high shares of renewable energies.

(p1.2) According to Wulf et al. (2020) as of June 2020, a total of 220 PtX research and demonstration projects in Europe have either been realized, completed, or were being planned with France and Germany undertaking the biggest efforts to develop PtX technologies compared to other European countries.The same research indicates that although interest in PtX projects has been growing constantly, at least until 2030, the only new countries to launch PtX projects are Hungary and Slovenia (Wulf et al. 2020).

(p1.3) In October 2022, the European Commission published a document outlining plans to digitalise the energy sector and to make it smarter and more interactive than it is today (Eur-Lex 2022).According to the Commission's publication, the European Green Deal and the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 for Europe go hand-in-hand as a twin transition for the digitisation of the energy system.The European Commission also plans to develop an experimental platform for blockchain-based energy trading, as well as actions to restrict energy use for crypto mining during the current crisis.The plan mainly involves distributed renewable energy projects which allow households and businesses greater control to provide solar-generated power to the grid or a local microgrid, with compensations recorded on blockchain.

(p1.4) The blockchain has the potential to verify the authenticity of financial transactions and traded goods by providing an electronic ledger for auditing, however it is not the only potential 'sustainable' technology that may be employed.For instance, augmented reality can enhance warehouse and plant workers' efficiency providing precise data on the actions that should be taken, from repairing general equipment to the point of any line requiring intervention.Likewise, 3D printing makes it possible to obtain electronic drawings and to print (rather than order) spare parts.Finally, recent development in telecommunications such as 5G facilitate ever larger amounts of data sharing at greater speeds between connected devices than ever before.Such novel practices, directly and indirectly, can also stimulate cleaner energy practices that can combat climate change and enhance resilience of energy systems.

(p1.5) Nevertheless, according to Eur-Lex (2022): 'the key enabler for a digitalised energy system is the availability of, access to, and sharing of energy-related data based on seamless and secure data transfers among trusted parties'.The latter may represent a crucial yet narrow focus on the diversity of sustainable technologies which may (when combined) have the greatest impact in turning industry networks into digital ecosystems as envisaged by the plan.However, this plan should also incorporate sustainable technological developments that expand the frontiers of legacy organisational structures and systems.To be sure, what can be achieved with 'energyrelated data based on seamless and secure data' are possible thanks to three technologies: AI, sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) spanning power generation at different scales, including control rooms, turbines, speed pumps, motors, distributed battery energy storage, smart meters, etc.
