## (s2) TOLAC -BETWEEN RISK AND BENEFITS
(p2.0) TOLAC is associated with a success rate ranging from 65% to 85% [12-14]. The rate of success depends on the previous indication for cesarean section (it is higher when the previous cesarean is done for malpresentation, gestational hypertension, or when the patient has a previous vaginal birth and may be lower when the cesarean is done for dystocia, diabetes, failure to progress or cephalopelvic disproportion) [15].
## (s5) JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE
(p5.0) Instead, the wrong selection of cases for TOLAC, intraoperative speed, history of cesarean section, fibroids, and endometriotic foci may increase the risk of injury of the bladder and ureters. In bladder lesions, the topography of the lesion is significant both in terms of its intraoperative resolution and long-term recovery. The ureteral injuries that might occur during cesarean result from intraoperative difficulty to control heavy bleedings from an anterior placenta site, a focal adherent placental tissue, an extension of the incision into the broad ligament, or blind hemostatic sutures. In very few cases, it's possible to damage the ureter directly following an iatrogenic extension of hysterotomy.

(p5.1) A higher incidence of left ureter damage was observed due to its anterior exposure by dextrorotation of the pregnant uterus [34]. Other author revealed no significant differences between the ureters regarding injury risk [20]. However, a study by Eisenkop and Rajasekar does not support this concept [23].
