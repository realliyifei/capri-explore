## (s2) SYMPTOMS OF FOLLICULAR CONTACT DERMATITIS
(p2.0) Follicular contact dermatitis is usually characterized by individual papules that include a central hair follicle. However, prominent hairs within the papules may not be readily visible when the lesions surround vellus hairs [1] . The papular lesions are frequently pruritic and occasionally painful or burning. The individual lesions have also been described as poral [2,3] or acneiform [1] . In addition, the clinical spectrum of follicular contact dermatitis also includes follicular-based pustules [3] .
## (s4) ALLERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS AND TOPICAL ANTIBIOTICS
(p4.0) Allergic contact dermatitis to topical antibiotics is a relatively common phenomenon. The North American Contact Dermatitis Group reported that among patients referred for patch testing, during 1985 to 2004, the prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis to neomycin ranged from 7.2 to 13.1 percent [13] .

(p4.1) Allergic contact dermatitis to topical antibiotics is most commonly observed in certain at-risk populations. These include patients with chronic eczematous dermatoses (such as atopy and stasis dermatitis), chronic otitis externa, chronic venous insufficiency, and post operative or post traumatic wounds. In addition, an occupational risk to develop allergic contact dermatitis to antibiotics occurs more frequently in those individuals who handle them regularly, such as farmers, health care workers, pharmaceutical employees, and veterinary surgeons [13] .
## (s7) Neomycin-associated follicular contact dermatitis
(p7.0) Neomycin-drug characteristics: Neomycin is produced by the growth of Streptomyces fradiae. It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial is based upon the drug's ability to irreversibly bind to the 30S ribosomal RNA subunits and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis [13,[30][31][32] .

(p7.1) Neomycin can be used as a topical antibiotic and has activity against many aerobic Gram-negative organisms (except Pseudomonas aeruginosa). It is also effective against some aerobic Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococci. However it is not effective against Streptococci [13,[30][31][32] .

(p7.2) Neomycin is usually formulated commercially as 20% neomycin sulfate in a petrolatum vehicle. However, it is often combined with other topical antibiotics such as bacitracin zinc and polymyxin B sulfate. This is done to expand the antimicrobial coverage [13,[30][31][32] .
## (s8) Neomycin-clinical presentation:
(p8.0) The woman in Figures 1-4 developed follicular contact dermatitis to an antibiotic ointment that contained neomycin sulfate in combination with bacitracin zinc and polymyxin B sulfate. Indeed, individual hair follicules were observed in the center of the papular lesions ( Figure 4). Allergic contact dermatitis has been reported to all three components of this antibiotic [33][34][35] . However, follicular contact dermatitis has only been described in association with neomycin.
## (s9) Neomycin-prior observations:
(p9.0) Allergic contact dermatitis to neomycin was initially reported in 1952 [36] . Six years later, in 1958, Epstein [9] described contact dermatitis to neomycin as "…an aggravation or "irritation" of a preexisting dermatitis…" and not the obvious picture of an acute contact dermatitis. He considered it to represent a dermal contact sensitivity reaction [9] . The lesions elicited by patch testing clinically presented as papules and histologically demonstrated an intact epidermis with pathologic changes in the dermis [9] .

(p9.1) Subsequently, Jillson et al [7] reported contact dermatitis to neomycin in 10 patients with atopic dermatitis. One of the patients, a 50-year-old woman had an eczematous dermatitis of her left flexor arm for which prior treatment with neomycin ointment had irritated the dermati-Cohen PR. Follicular contact dermatitis tis [7] . Patch testing to neomycin ointment "…was characterized by multiple small (papules of) eczematous areas rather than a confluent eczematous plaque [7] ".
## (s11) CONTACT DERMATITIS
(p11.0) Several hypotheses have been suggested for the selective involvement of the follicles in follicular contact dermatitis in contrast to the diffuse clinical changes more fre-quently observed in allergic or irritant contact dermatitis. These include direct penetration of the stratum corneum by the agent via the pilosebaceous apparatus, hapten conjugation of the agent to a substance only present in the infundibular region, or both [6] . Other factors may also influence the development of follicular contact dermatitis.
## (s12) Patient allergenicity
(p12.0) Previously individuals with atopy were considered less likely to be susceptible to allergic contact dermatitis. However, several subsequent studies have demonstrated that atopic patients not only develop contact dermatitis to metals [37] , but also more commonly develop follicular contact dermatitis [38,39] . Hence, the patient's diathesis to allergens may influence whether they develop follicular
## (s13) Selenium salts
(p13.0) In glass industry, 4 employees exposed to barium and sodium selenite suffered from dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis; 2 of the patients developed follicular allergic contact dermatitis with papulo-follicular lesions. Patch testing with sodium selenite confirmed the diagnosis  contact dermatitis [17] .
## (s14) Characteristics of the agent
(p14.0) Heavier molecules are less easily capable of penetrating the epidermis as compared to lighter molecules. Hence, it can be hypothesized that the heavier molecules exhibit a preference for entering the dermis through the pilosebaceous units of hair follicles. For example, cobalt demonstrates an increased number and severity of contact dermatitis reactions at follicles [3] . Neomycin, is a larger molecule than cobalt; therefore, the size of neomycin may account for the observed follicular contact dermatitis to this agent (Figures 1-4).

(p14.1) The concentration of the agent can also influence a predilection for follicular contact dermatitis. Not only cobalt, but also tungstate shows an increase in follicular reactions at higher concentrations [3,18] .
## (s15) Vehicle containing the agent
(p15.0) Lipophilic irritant agents absorb through the pilosebaceous apparatus [40] . However, water-soluble substances penetrate more easily into and around hair follicles [3] . Yet, in patch test reactions to metals, follicular contact dermatitis is more common when the testing vehicle is petrolatum as compared to water [3] .
## (s16) Application of the agent
(p16.0) Not only in patch testing, but also in clinical use features regarding the application of the agent can potentially influence the occurrence and severity of follicular contact dermatitis [41,42] . It is reasonable to hypothesize that repeated application and occlusion of the agent may allow for greater contact with larger areas of epithelium instead of only the follicles, resulting in a more confluent dermatitis. Therefore, follicular reactions are less likely to occur when the agent is applied more frequently or is occluded.
## (s17) External factors
(p17.0) Follicular contact dermatitis to heavy metals was increased in individuals with hyperkeratosis of their hair follicles; Beetle toxin Pederin toxin released as a defensive mechanism from the rove (staphylinid) beetle in hot tropical and moderate climate regions typically limited to uncovered body areas [22,23] Bis-hydroxyethyl-tallow amine Antistatic agent used to impregnate plastic tote boxes; outbreak of the hand or arms of 48.3% (14 of 29) of employees of the incoming inspections department of a microelectronic plant. The chemical provoked both follicular and nonfollicular irritant dermatitis; it was also a potential skin sensitizer [24] Coal-tar products Hand dermatitis presenting with follicular papules and pustules at the site of exposure to coal-tar oils, creosote, pitch [25] Croton oil Occupational source for irritant pustular and follicular irritant contact hand dermatitis [25] Debromoaplysiatoxin

(p17.1) Occurs after swimming in water contaminated by sea algae (Lyngbya majuscule Gomont); the alga cause a seaweed dermatitis in persons swimming off the coastin Oahu, Hawaii. Topical application of the toxin produces an irritant pustular folliculitis [26] Fluorine Antirust solution containing 20% ammonium bifluoride diluted in water; acute irritant contact dermatitis in an atopic child. Rusted buckles of the right shoe cleaned with solution; 12 h later, the 19-mo-old boy developed an erythematous pustular dermatitis on the areas of the treated buckles [27] Greases Occupational source for irritant pustular and follicular irritant contact hand dermatitis [25] Naphthalones
## (s18) DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF FOLLICULAR CONTACT DERMATITIS
(p18.0) Conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of follicular contact dermatitis are listed in Table 3 [6,10] . Some of the patients with follicular contact dermatitis were initially considered to have disseminated recurrent  
## (s19) A B
(p19.0) infundibular folliculitis-even though they were Caucasian [6,10] . In contrast to follicular contact dermatitis which was characterized by severe itching or areas of erythema and oozing or both in some of the patients, infundibular folliculitis is typically observed in black patients as mild to moderately pruritic or burning, flesh colored, widely distributed, non-inflammatory follicular papules; the papules are typically refractory to treatment and the recurrent episodes persist for weeks to months before spontaneously resolving [43,44] . An individual in whom infundibulofolliculitis was suspected presented with recurrent 2-mm erythematous follicular papules. She was a 24-year-old nurse whose skin eruption partially improved with topical corticosteroids and resolved when her boyfriend moved to another city. However, it recurred when he returned and they went to the beach. Subsequently, the diagnosis of consort follicular contact dermatitis to the homomenthyl salicylate in her boy friend's Coppertone sunscreen lotion was considered and confirmed by positive patch testing to the lotion; additional patch testing to each component of the lotion was only positive for homomenthyl salicylate [6] .

(p19.1) The other patients had been exposed to a chemical used in colored permanent-pressed sheets [10] . Not only the distribution and duration of the follicular contact dermatitis, but also the histopathology of the chemical-associated lesions were similar to those observed in individuals with infundibulofolliculitis. However several features permitted the patients with follicular contact dermatitis to be differentiated from those with infundibulofolliculitis: severe itching (as compared to mild or moderate pruritus), the presence of erythematous and even oozing areas (as compared to nonflammatory lesions) and a white patient population (as compared to occurring in African American individuals) [10] .
## (s21) CONTACT DERMATITIS
(p21.0) The primary management of follicular contact dermatitis is withdrawal of the causative agent. The skin lesions for many of the affected individuals either resolved spontaneously or following treatment with a topical corticosteroid preparation. However, is some of the patients lesions either persisted or recurred even after elimination of the inducing chemical or repetitive washing of the eliciting item from the source of exposure; specifically, follicular contact dermatitis persisted up to 8 wk after exposure to chemical in colored permanent-pressed sheets had been eliminated and new lesions would appear even after the sheets had been washed 3 or 4 times [10] .
