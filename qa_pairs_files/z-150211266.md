## (s19) Data Analysis
(p19.0) In order to further process the factors of influence, we first need unique examples of factors and to remove multiple mentions of the same factor in our primary studies set.We base this step on the title and explanation of the factor we extracted from the primary studies.We also grouped slight variations in interpretations of the factors into one unique factor.This step is not trivial, and we will return to this in the Threats of Validity section.

(p19.1) To analyze how the factors of influence map onto the classification of environmental effects of ICT, We use the structure of Hilty's framework (Figure 1) to classify the factors.The framework can be broken down in two aspects: Order of effect; problem vs solution.

(p19.2) The first aspect is the order of effect.The factor of influence can target the direct impact of ICT, for example energy consumption of ICT equipment; target the indirect impact of ICT, for example the avoided CO 2 emissions of traveling by using videoconferencing; or target the systemic impact of ICT, for example a large increase of use of videoconferencing that provides a counter effect to the reduction of CO 2 emissions [14].

(p19.3) The second aspect is whether ICT is part of the problem (reduce negative impact on the environment) or part of the solution (the net effect of the introduction of ICT is positive).Some factors can be unbiased because they can include both, for example Innovation can focus on reducing the footprint of ICT itself, but also on optimizing other processes with the use of ICT.

(p19.4) The next step is to present this classification as a taxonomy of factors of influence.This is to do justice to the difference in the levels of detail in the different primary studies.Some studies, for example, only mention the 'Indirect impact of ICT', whereas others mention a subclass such as 'Teleconferencing'.We used the cluster title to identify where the factor should be placed.We also use this taxonomy to limit the results to two class levels: The main classes and their subclasses.Subsubclasses lower in the tree are collapsed into their parent class.

(p19.5) With this taxonomy, we can then analyze which order of effects the factors of influence are most focused on and whether there are any gaps.Conversely, there may be factors of influence that do not fit the framework.If possible, we propose a classification for these factors as an addition to the framework.
## (s31) Gaps in the Taxonomy
(p31.0) In our analysis of the factors of influence found in the primary studies, we identified a number of gaps based on Hilty's framework.These gaps were present in the domains of 'Indirect impact of ICT' and 'Systemic impact of ICT'.Why are these effects missing in our primary studies?

(p31.1) In the domain of 'Indirect impact of ICT', the induction effects and obsolescence effects are not represented by the factors we found.Both effects are problem-side indirect effects of ICT on the environment.The induction effect is described as how the introduction of ICT can stimulate "the consumption of another resource (e.g., a printer stimulates the consumption of paper as it uses it faster than a typewriter)" [5].The obsolescence effect happens when ICT shortens "the useful life of another resource due to incompatibility (a device that is no longer supported by software updates is rendered obsolete)" [5].Both effects point to side-effects of the introduction of an ICT solution, presumably because consumers or users are not (initially) aware of these effects (suppliers may very well be though).

(p31.2) As for the gaps at the 'Systemic impact of ICT', we found a different interpretation in the factors of influence that may or may not be covered by the effects mentioned in Hilty's framework (Figure 1).For an organization introducing an ICT solution, it may be difficult to pinpoint the rebound effects, emerging risks or decoupling effects.We believe the main reason for this is the scope of effects: The boundaries are not within the organization, but may affect society as a whole.This implies that knowledge is required of interactions between the ICT solution and other processes and behaviors, making it very complex to carry out.The two factors we found that are part of the 'Systemic impact of ICT' are closely related to the ICT solution, whereas the effects mentioned by Hilty are more related to the impact the ICT solution has on society and the environmental consequences.Can we ask an actor, such as an organization delivering an ICT solution, to take responsibility for such effects?

(p31.3) We think that the main reason for these gaps is that they all describe effects that are not part of a narrow view of (using an) ICT (solution).They raise concerns about side-effects or effects caused by (complex) interactions between technology, behavior and structure.Having the right information at the right time may be a way to increase awareness of these effects and to allow individuals and organizations to make better decisions.Therefore, introducing these as awareness factors (e.g., 'Rebound effect awareness'), for example part of 'Feedback and reporting', could be a way to complement the factors we found in the primary studies.
