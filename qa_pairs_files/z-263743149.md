## (s12) Adverse events
(p12.0) Two reviews [20,24] reported the influence of telerehabilitation on adverse events.Jansson et al. [20] showed that telerehabilitation had no significant effect on the occurrence of adverse events.Tsang et al. [24] reported that the rehospitalisation rate in an intervention group within 12 weeks was significantly lower than in a control group.However, the evidence quality was low.
## (s13) Patient satisfaction
(p13.0) Four reviews [18,19,29,30] evaluated the intervention effect of telerehabilitation on patient satisfaction.One review [18] showed that the telerehabilitation and control groups had similar patient satisfaction levels.Three reviews [19,29,30] showed that the changes in patient satisfaction were not statistically significant in either group.
## (s15) Discussion
(p15.0) Telerehabilitation can provide patients with more flexible and convenient rehabilitation services using information technology, which compensates for shortcomings of conventional rehabilitation and is a complementary or alternative method to  conventional nursing [9].In this study, the AMSTAR-2, PRISMA, GRADE and ROBIS grades were used for the first time to review the effectiveness and safety of telerehabilitation in patients following TKA to provide more evidence for clinical decision making.Among the 13 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 92.3% were published in the last 5 years, indicating increasing attention to telerehabilitation in recent years.

(p15.1) Based on the evaluation results of AMSTAR 2, the quality of the methodologies included in these reviews should be improved.The main issues identified in terms of critical weaknesses included item 2 (scheme registration in advance), item 4 (the comprehensive retrieval strategy) (n = 4, 30.8%),item 7 (the list of reasons for the exclusion of each document not being provided) (n = 13, 100%), item 13 (the risk of inclusion bias not considered when interpreting or discussing the findings) (n = 8, 61.5%) and item 15 (publication bias not being evaluated and discussed) (n = 7, 53.8%).Among the noncritical weaknesses, none of the systematic reviews described the source of funding for the included original research, and the study results may have been affected by the funding situation.Future systematic reviews and meta-analyses should strictly comply with the AMSTAR 2 standards to reduce methodological defects and bias and improve rigour.

(p15.2) According to the PRISMA 2020 assessment results, most reviews (76.9%) were relatively complete; however, none fully matched the quality of the PRISMA reports.The main issues were as follows: nine reviews (69.2%) did not have study protocol registration numbers, five (38.5%) did not provide other available materials and evidence certainty, four (30.8%) did not report study bias, and three (23.0%)did not perform certainty assessment.Future systematic reviews should follow the PRISMA report list to avoid these problems.

(p15.3) According to the ROBIS bias risk assessment results, domains 2 and 4 in the second stage had a high risk of bias.The main issues in determining and selecting research in domain 2 were as follows: most of the reviews were retrieved from the MEDLINE and Embase databases.However, conference reports and clinical trial registration platforms were not retrieved, and some reviews had restrictions on publication form and language, leading to bias.Shortcomings regarding data synthesis and result presentation in domain 4 included the inability to assess adherence to the predetermined scheme, the absence of sensitivity analysis and the potential unreliability of some results.In the third stage, all the reviews showed a high risk of bias, which may be related to the lack of a corresponding explanation and treatment of the partial bias risk in the second stage.

(p15.4) According to the GRADE evidence quality evaluation results, most of the 59 outcome indicators (55.9%) had low-quality or no high-quality evidence.The main factors affecting the evidence quality were the limitations of the original studies in terms of randomisation, blinding methods and allocation hiding.The second factor was publication bias, owing to the limited number of included studies or small sample sizes, lack of funnel plot analysis and other relevant considerations.In addition, due to the different intervention methods and measurement tools used in the included studies, heterogeneity was high, which affected the quality of evidence.A detailed description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and appropriate subgroup analyses were required.In conclusion, clinical studies should focus on improving quality and standardising research methods to provide more reliable and objective data.Our findings indicate that telerehabilitation positively affected walking ability, knee extension and costs for patients after TKA.Telerehabilitation was similar to conventional rehabilitation regarding the WOMAC score, quality of life and patient satisfaction.Telerehabilitation had no significant effect on pain or joint flexion.In addition, the effect of telerehabilitation on KOOS and adverse events in patients with TKA remains controversial.However, the above results should be treated with caution owing to the low quality of the studies assessed in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
## (s18) Materials and methods
(p18.0) This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) list [13] and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registration number: CRD42023401152).The inclusion criteria were male or female patients aged ≥ 18 who underwent TKA.

(p18.1) The intervention groups comprised those who had undergone remote rehabilitation using the internet, smartphones, virtual reality or conference calls.The control groups received routine nursing and face-to-face rehabilitation therapy or were the blank control group.The primary outcome measures were pain, knee flexion and extension, timed up and go (TUG) test score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) and patient quality of life.The secondary outcome measures were adverse events, patient satisfaction and costs.The study type comprised systematic reviews of telerehabilitation in patients who underwent TKA with or without meta-analyses.The exclusion criteria comprised studies not published in English or Chinese, duplicate publications, conference abstracts, studies where the full text is unobtainable, studies mainly measuring the performance of applications and wearable devices and studies involving patients with other comorbidities in which TKA was not the main research topic.
## (s25) Reporting quality evaluation
(p25.0) Two researchers evaluated each study's quality using PRISMA [13], the preferred reporting method for determining items when assessing systematic reviews and meta-analyses.There were 27 items, including the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion and funding statements.The presence, partial presence or absence of each item was indicated by 'yes' , 'partially yes' and 'no' , with scores of 1, 0.5 and 0, respectively, with a total possible score of 27.A score of ≤ 15 was defined as a relatively severe information deficiency, 15-21 showed a certain reporting deficiency, and 21-27 indicated that the report was relatively complete.The results were checked after the evaluation, and discussions were held with a third person (fei wang)when the researchers disagreed.
## (s26) Risk of bias assessment
(p26.0) The risk of bias was assessed by two researchers using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) scale [15], which consists of three stages.The first stage assessed the correlations (selected based on the situation).The second stage determined the risk of bias in the process of systematic review production in terms of four areas: the inclusion criteria, search and screening, data extraction and quality assessment and data synthesis and presentation of results, with a total of 21 items.The third stage determined the ROBIS as high risk, low risk or uncertain.Using ROBIS, we checked the results following this evaluation, and any disagreements were discussed with a third person(fei wang).
