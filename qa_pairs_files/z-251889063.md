## (s2) Matching problems
(p2.0) The matching problem MATCH for subsequences is to decide, given two words u, w ∈ Σ * with |u| = m and |w| = n, whether u is a subsequence of w. In the general case, that is without further restrictions like gap constrains or bounded ranges, it is quite easy to answer: if we go left-to-right through w and greedily search for the letters u [1] to u[m], we answer positively if and only if we find all letters from u in w. This greedy approach obviously is correct and works in linear time O(n).
## (s8) Definition 20 (-Absent subsequences). A word v is an absent subsequence of w if v is not a subsequence of w. An absent subsequence v of w is a minimal absent subsequence (for short, MAS) of w if every proper subsequence of v is a subsequence of w. We will denote the set of all MAS of w by MAS(w). An absent subsequence v of w is a shortest absent subsequence (for short, SAS) of w if |v| ≤ |v ′ | for any other absent subsequence v ′ of w. We will denote the set of all SAS of w by SAS(w).
(p8.0) Absent subsequences in words. Note that, in general, any shortest absent subsequence of a word w has length ι(w) + 1, where ι(w) is the universality index of w. This already establishes a connection to the results presented in previous section. Moreover, we notice that we can easily find at least one SAS (and therefore an MAS) of w from its arch factorisation: for 1 ≤ i ≤ ι(w) let u i = ar w (i)[| ar w (i)]| be the last letter of the i th arch of w and u ι(w)+1 be any letter not occurring in r(w), then u = u 1 · · · u ι(w)+1 is an SAS of w. By refining this approach we can, for given w ∈ Σ * , build in linear time a data structure allowing us to identify a succinct representation of a SAS of any factor w[i : j] of w in constant time (and effectively output this SAS in time proportional to its length). Given u, w ∈ Σ * the problem to check whether u is an SAS or, respectively, an MAS of w is decidable in linear time (see [44]).
