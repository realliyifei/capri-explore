## (s1) Materials and Methods
(p1.0) The study takes into account secondary scientific evidence published between 2010 and 2022. The originally performed search covered the period from 1 January 2010 to 14 March 2021. Due to the fact that relevant publications could have been published after this period, the search was updated covering the period from 14 March 2021 to 24 May 2022. The above made it possible to find the most up-to-date and reliable data. The search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via OVID) and Cochrane Library, in accordance with the previously prepared strategy (supplementary material).
