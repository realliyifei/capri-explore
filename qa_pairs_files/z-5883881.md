## (s2) Primary immunomodulatory therapeutics
(p2.0) The goal of mainstay therapies of MS is to reduce relapses and postpone progression of disability in patients. 23,24 To this end, strategies adopted to treat MS are twofold: a short-term treatment to help reduce the accumulation of disease burden after an acute relapse, and a long-term, sustained treatment aimed at stabilizing the disease process. 25 
## (s3) Short-term treatment for acute relapse
(p3.0) In the initial stages of an MS relapse, individuals are generally treated with high doses (500-1,000 mg) of intravenous corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone) for a short period of 3-5 days. In rare cases, subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of adrenocorticotropic hormone (eg, HP Acthar Â® gel) are used, specifically for individuals who cannot tolerate or have poor response to intravenous prednisolone. [26][27][28] These anti-inflammatory agents accelerate the process of recovery, and reduce duration of the relapse; however, they do not have any bearing on the occurrence of new relapses or on long-term disease progression.
