## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) The increase in threats from global warming due to the consumption of fossil fuels requires our planet to adopt new strategies to harness the inexhaustible sources of energy [1,2].Hydrogen is an energy carrier which holds tremendous promise as a new renewable and clean energy option [3].Hydrogen is a convenient, safe, versatile fuel source that can be easily converted to a desired form of energy without releasing harmful emissions.Hydrogen is the ideal fuel for the future since it significantly reduces the greenhouse gas emissions, reduces the global dependence on fossil fuels, and increases the efficiency of the energy conversion process for both internal combustion engines and proton exchange membrane fuel cells [4,5].Hydrogen used in the fuel cell directly converts the chemical energy of hydrogen into water, electricity, and heat [6] as represented by
## (s7) High-surface area sorbents and new materials concepts
(p7.0) There is a pressing need for the discovery and development of new reversible materials.One new area that may be promising is that of high-surface area hydrogen sorbents based on microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).Such materials are synthetic, crystalline, and microporous and are composed of metal/oxide groups linked together by organic struts.Hydrogen storage capacity at 78 K (−195 • C) has been reported as high as 4 wt% via an adsorptive mechanism, with a room temperature capacity of approximately 1 wt% [54].However, due to the highly porous nature of these materials, volumetric capacity may still be a significant issue.Another class of materials for hydrogen storage may be clathrates [15], which are primarily hydrogen-bonded H 2 O frameworks.Initial studies have indicated that significant amounts of hydrogen molecules can be incorporated into the sII clathrate.Such materials may be particularly viable for off-board storage of hydrogen without the need for high pressure or liquid hydrogen tanks.
