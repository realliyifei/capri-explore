## (s26) Literature Review
(p26.0) When it comes to traffic signs, storefront signs act as their sole point of reference for drivers navigating the complex system of streets and highways, effectively directing them to commercial destinations.A notable study conducted by Abdulilah Z. Zineddin et al. (2005), which focused on premise signage, sought to refute the widely held belief that larger parallel signs would be more noticeable than their smaller perpendicular counterparts.The study meticulously observed 120 people from various age groups in both diurnal and nocturnal settings, using real-world scenarios and an open-field research methodology.This study focused on a critical comparison between parallel signs that ran parallel to the road and perpendicular signs that were placed in strategic alignment with the direction of approaching traffic.Contrary signs stood out significantly, proving to be more discernible and legible when compared to their larger parallel counterparts, challenging the conventional wisdom in the field of traffic signage visibility, contrary to conventional belief, which was uncovered by the research [5].
