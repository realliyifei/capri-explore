## (s1) Definitions
(p1.0) In 2006, the WSACS published a series of definitions they are still valid today [5]. Within these definitions, ACS is defined as an elevated IAP of more than 25 mmHg associated with new organ failure. Trigger factors, located inside of the abdominal cavity, induce a primary ACS, whereas trigger factors, out with the abdomino-pelvic cavity, contribute to the development of a secondary ACS. When abdominal scars and adhesions exist, the IAP varies in different parts of peritoneal cavity, resulting in what is described as polyACS.

(p1.1) In addition to well-established definitions, there are a number of recommendations and suggestions that have not been firmly endorsed, and further studies are required to accurately determine the level of implementation. They have been classified according to recommendation or suggestion in grades A to D; Astrongly recommended, D-poorly recommended, with subcategories occurring in each major grouping [5].
## (s4) Diagnosis
(p4.0) Measurement of IAP was recommended after recognition of severe effects of increased IAP and due to a low sensitivity of the whole series of clinical examinations tests [20]. The main variants of IAP measurement are presented in Table II [21].

(p4.1) The direct method is the most sensitive in determining PIA values. It is an invasive one, not without complications [22]. Laparoscopy allows the direct recording of IAP throughout the surgical procedure and allows the pneumoperitoneum pressure to be controlled. Studies related to the negative impact of intra-abdominal hypertension on body systems have been correlated with establishing the standard value of pneumoperitoneum pressure commonly used in laparoscopic interventions at 12 mmHg -capillary perfusion pressure [23].
