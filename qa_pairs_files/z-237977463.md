## (s2) Carbohydrates
(p2.0) Sugar in honey is not a single species, but consists of three kinds of sugar. These are the fruit sugar (fructose), which has among the highest (41%), grape sugar (glucose), which has about 34% of ordinary sugar (sucrose) which is between 1 and 2% [5]. The ratio of one type of sugar to other depends of the source, i.e., flower pasture, and to some extent on enzyme invertase, which breaks down regular sugar in grape and fruit.
