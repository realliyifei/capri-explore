## (s9) Conclusions
(p9.0) This study has important implications for researchers.This study provides a systematic overview of which influencer characteristics have been studied in relation to consumer behaviour using quantitative research methods.Some previous systematic research (Vrontis et al., 2021) also explored influencer characteristics, but a small number of characteristics were included.To our knowledge, this study provides the most complete list of influencer characteristics in the domain of influencer marketing from previous research.It provides unique insights into how influencer characteristics can impact consumer behaviour, enabling researchers to conveniently locate influencer characteristics with relevant references.

(p9.1) The four categories (psychological, social, behavioural and demographic) of characteristics offer a logical way to comprehend and classify influencer characteristics.In addition, this method provides a framework to further distinguish more potential influencer characteristics that have not yet been studied.For example, body language has been identified as one of the behavioural characteristics that impacts on consumer behaviour.Similarly, facial expressions and speaking speed are also in the same behavioural category, and further research is needed on these characteristics.

(p9.2) The most important theoretical implication of this paper is the finding that influencer psychological characteristics such as expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness have been over-studied.However, research gaps exist in the areas of influencer social characteristics, such as envy and betrayal, and behavioural characteristics, such as facial body language and sharing secrets.In addition, the importance of demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, or ethnicity, is another area recommended for future research.

(p9.3) This study also provides practical implications for businesses in the form of insights into the importance of influencer characteristics for companies when choosing influencers for endorsements.For example, the importance of congruence and homophily shows that an endorsement will be much more effective when a marketing manager finds a credible influencer who best fits the brand and demonstrates similarities with target consumers.When choosing different types of influencers, social media influencers can be more effective than traditional celebrities when advertisement messages are delivered in a subtle way, whilst celebrities can achieve more effective endorsements with more intrusive advertising.Furthermore, marketers and influencers should pay attention to specific behaviours, such as interaction and sharing secrets, which can also boost the effects of endorsements.Overall, the theoretical analysis provided in this paper offers information to marketers in business practice, enabling them to more effectively select influencers when designing marketing campaigns.
