## (s5) III. NFTs IN BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT, AND ACCOUNTING
(p5.0) In this section, we discuss the use of NFTs in Business and Management. Table 2, 3, and 4 list the papers that deliberate the applications of NFTs in Business and Management. Scopus database was used to find these papers. Since this is a new and emerging field, very few studies from reputable sources could be found.

(p5.1) One of the latest works, when searching for NFTs, comes out to be that of Whitaker (2022). Here, the author does narrate a case created out of interviews but upon detailed review this publication doesn't appear to fall in the category of research focusing on NFTs. The work of Bouraga (2021) prototype, and implement a decentralized NFT-based event-ticketing system. They found that this system could be a good replacement of a conventional event-ticketing system because it may help in preventing fraud, better control on secondary market transactions, and validation of ownership.
