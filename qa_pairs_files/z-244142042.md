## (s12) Discussion of EIM and Pells' Methods
(p12.0) The easiness and wide pertinence to different stream conditions make the erodibility index method (EIM) especially alluring for practice.In any case, this approach is not without confinement.As the name of this approach suggests, it consolidates an empirical index to classify and identify the rock.Along these lines, the EIM cannot reveal various erosion mechanisms (i.e., fatigue failure, block removal, or brittle failure).The results of EIM are general and do not incorporate the erosion mechanisms.The geometry of rock is considered 2D, and the 3D nature of the discontinuity orientations is not accounted.However, this method can illustrate the discontinuity structure relative to the flow direction.

(p12.1) The data analysed by Annandale consider several types of flow conditions (137 case studies), while Pells used the predominant channel flow in spillways.Under the channel flow conditions, block removal is considered to be the dominant mechanism for scour to occur; thus, the analysis of variables representing blocks (e.g., K b ) in those cases would be expected to show great importance.Under the jet conditions wherein fracturing of the rock can be more dominant, the other variables may be shown to be more relevant (e.g., M s ).

(p12.2) Rock scour is a highly complicated mechanism, and its evaluation should start by identifying the relevant rock mass parameters to assess this mechanism.For this purpose, in 2019, Boumaiza et al. developed a method on the basis of real data and previous empirical methods [35].They examined a set of rock mass parameters to determine those that are considered related parameters to evaluate the rock mass erosion.In the proposed approach, various parameters are assessed, such as E doa , NPES, J o , J s , K d , K b , V b , and UCS.Finally, K d , V b , J o , E doa , and NPES were chosen as the relevant parameters by sensitivity analysis.
