## (s1) Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms
(p1.0) The implementation of cryptography has helped different information forms for being legally accessed via an authentic user with the assist of its typical processes of encryption.But, there are several differences when implementing encryption on ordinary files and on digital images [11].The pixels' contents inside any digital image are infinite and so, the encryption algorithm relies on the sampling process as well.Recently, there are lots of developed researches that have concentrated on image encryption, however, until now there is no standard algorithm of encryption that provides full coverage of security standards (privacy, availability, integrity, confidentiality, etc.).The best algorithm of image encryption refers to the encrypted image that has a low correlation with the original image i.e. high imperceptibility for the encrypted image.

(p1.1) The main challenges that face the designing of any algorithm of image encryption are; constructing a lightweight cryptographic algorithm without increasing the burden of computation with a high number of encryptions, obtaining high imperceptibility for the encrypted image, getting faster response time for the encryption process, and retaining the highest level of image information in the decryption process [12].

(p1.2) Similar to the algorithms of cryptography, the lightweight cryptographic algorithms are also separated into two parts: symmetric and asymmetric algorithms [13].Symmetric algorithms include stream and block ciphers.These ciphers are deliberately used with gadgets, and there are not any limitations for getting categorized as lightweight.Performance, cost, and security represent the main significant portions to deal with by every architect of lightweight cryptography.It is extremely hard to achieve the fundamental design aims: performance and security, cost and security, or performance and cost at the same time, whilst it is not difficult to develop any one of these aims.The symmetric ciphers' elements are entity authentication, encryption, checking message integrity, and etc., whilst the management of key and nonrepudiation are further functions supplied via asymmetric ciphers [14].Lightweight Elliptic curve is asymmetric cipher that capable of ensuring both confidentiality and authentication, however, it requires more consumption of memory and larger size of key which led to make it less popular [15] [16].
## (s3) Developed Lightweight Salsa20 Algorithm-Based Image Encryption
(p3.0) The stream cipher Salsa20 was presented via Bernstein [20].It provides a clean, scalable, and very easy design, and offers 128, and 256 bits of keys in an extremely normal manner.The basic Salsa includes twenty rounds, however, subsequent Salsa includes eight rounds and twelve rounds.The original lightweight Salsa20 algorithm is constructed using a pseudorandom function depend on Add Rotate XOR operations.Hereafter, ⊕ indicates the bitwise XOR, + indicates the addition modulo (2 32 ), || represents the concatenation, and A<<<l indicates the lbit left shift rotation on a word A. Salsa20 utilizes the counter mode hash function Salsa20.The keystream of 512 bits is generated with 64 bits counter and 64 bits' initial vector as inputs.Salsa20 represents a stream cipher of word-oriented.Every word represents a component of F2 32 and includes 32 bits.At first, the Salsa20's round function is described using 4×4 matrix of words [21];
## (s5) Developed Lightweight Chacha20 Algorithm-Based Image Encryption
(p5.0) The encryption algorithm Chacha20 is a lightweight algorithm that belongs to the Salsa algorithm family but differs in detail.Chacha20 provided the best security than the original Salsa20 cipher, via utilizing somewhat preferable hash functions.The hash function input data rearranged for implementing the algorithm effectively [27].

(p5.1) The stream cipher Chacha20 algorithm works on 64 bytes of data blocks.The ChaCha20 algorithm calls the function of expansion to every 64 bytes of the data block.The input to this function represents a secret key of 32,16, or 8 bytes, furthermore, related to the number of the presently encrypted block.The essence of the lightweight Chacha20 algorithm is concentrated on utilizing the function of mixing that takes 64 bytes from the function of expansion, after that, combines these bytes, and lastly yields other 64 bytes of data to the function of expansion.The function of mixing works on data separated into 32-bit words ordered in a 4×4 matrix.The input matrix w is given as follows [28]: (6) The fundamental role of the ChaCha20 algorithm is given to the QuarterRD function in which four words (e; f; g; h) are taken as input and four words are obtained as output after implementing the following operations of 32-bit:

(p5.2) The DoubleRd function is called within the function of mixing that accepts matrix w as input and results another matrix; Since the ChaCha20 algorithm considers a relatively new lightweight stream algorithm, therefore, there are no much researches in the literature working on the application of digital image encryption.Here, we can mention a developed lightweight ChaCha20 algorithm using hyperchaotic maps in the application of digital image encryption proposed by M. S. Mahdi et al. [29].This developed lightweight algorithm for image encryption has achieved robustness to brute force attacks via supplying a massive space of keys.Several criteria were utilized in this algorithm for defense from statistical cracking and non-security of images.Furthermore, this developed ChaCha20 algorithm can run in real-time since it requires about 3.5 seconds consuming time.
