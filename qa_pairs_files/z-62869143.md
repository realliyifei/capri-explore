## (s1) Ruminal Microorganisms
(p1.0) After the consumption of a high grain diet, non-structural carbohydrates appear in the rumen (by the physiological process), which after fermentation by the amylolytic bacteria which in turn leads to the production of pyruvate and finally VFA that result in the drop in ruminal pH.This drop implies that many gram-negative bacteria, being sensitive to low due to their pH sensitivity, disappear, including lactate-consuming bacteria, like Megasphaera elsdenii and Selenomonas ruminantium (which convert lactate to pyruvate).The lactic acid bacteria growing under conditions of low rumen pH utilize lactic acid as an energy substrate, in addition to other substrates (Marx et al., 2011).Conversely, there is an increase in the population of some gram-positive bacteria, especially Streptococcus bovis, also known as lactate-producing bacteria.This change in the ruminal bacterial population further reduces ruminal pH by that is the increase in L-lactic acid, which is a very potent acid (10 times stronger than VFA).This to a leads to allowing the growth of only the pH resistant bacteria, such as, Lactobacillus spp., which are an (efficient lactate producer, especially of D-lactate).Thus, that leads ton additional in ruminal pH eventually drops to 3.8, which is the isoelectric point of this acid.At this pH, at which the acid remains un-dissociated that results in the movement of the acid via the ruminal wall into the bloodstream leading to metabolic acidosis (Hernández et al., 2014).
## (s3) Modern pH Measurement
(p3.0) The modern wireless radio transmission mediated pH measurement system was used employed to continuously monitor the ruminal bottom pH in the cows.No significant difference was observed in the pH measurement by modern pH measurement system and the pH values determined by the spot-sample method (Sato et al., 2012).Penner et al. (2006) developed a pH tracing device for a lactating dairy cow that experienced SARA.The duration at which pH remained below the threshold value of 5.8 in a 24-h period was used to characterize SARA.The events of sub-acute ruminal acidosis were noted as 6.4, 6.5, and 11.8 h/d on Aug 5/6, 6/7, and 7/8, respectively.Although, indwelling ruminal pH monitoring systems are widely used in research, there is no reliable system for continuous measurement of ruminal pH in commercial dairy cows.The limitation to developing such a system is the need of the regular standardization of pH electrodes to avoid faulty errors results.More over.In addition, this technique will require cannulation of the rumen in cattle (Sato et al., 2012).
## (s4) Saliva and Buffering
(p4.0) Saliva maintains normal rumen pH by neutralizing acids in the rumen, which influences the liquid passage rate by the removal of large amounts of acids.In fact, some researchers believe that one of the main functions of saliva is to increase the rate of passage of the liquid phase of the rumen and not necessarily to neutralize the acids produced by ruminal fermentation.When ruminants are fed on the diets are rich in fiber, the rate of rumination and saliva production is increased (Hernández et al., 2014;Pan et al., 2016).This increases the rate of passage of the liquid phase by up to 20% per hour.This means that the large amounts of VFA are transferred from the rumen to the omasum and abomasum without being accumulated in the rumen, thereby providing insufficient time to VFA to cause changes in the rumen (Krause et al., 2014).The addition of bicarbonate and phosphate salts leads to recycling of urea in the rumen, which is readily hydrolyzed and converted into ammonia, which contributes to the buffering effect of the saliva in the rumen.If the consumption of fermentable organic matter (OM) increases in the rumen, it reduces the chewing rate and rumination of the ingested fermentable OM (Enemark, 2008;Aschenbach et al., 2014).This results in the elevated VFA production in the absence of a compensatory increase in the saliva buffering.Therefore, in such cases, an increase in the VFA absorption rate by ruminal epithelium and the increase in the rate of passage of the liquid and solid phases of the rumen mechanisms are critical to evaluate a possible accumulation of acids in the rumen (Hernández et al., 2014).
## (s5) Prevention of Ruminal Acidosis
(p5.0) Ruminant animals are adapted to digest and metabolize predominantly forage diets.Thus, the growth rates and milk production are substantially increased when ruminants consume high-grain diets.One of the consequences of feeding excessive amounts of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates together with inadequate fiber to ruminants is the sub-acute ruminal acidosis, which is characterized by an episode of low ruminal pH that resolves without treatment and is rarely diagnosed (Krause et al., 2014).Dairy cows and feedlot cattle are at risk of developing such a condition.Acidosis can be prevented by formulating a diet that avoids excessive acid production in the rumen, and by adopting a suitable nutritional management that does not change microorganisms in the rumen (Liu et al., 2016).A gradual adaptation to the diet with higher amounts of grain is essential to avoid acute acidosis.Feedlots using termination diets with large amounts of starch should initially be adapted by giving two or even three diets with increasing concentrations of grain.The use of fatty by-products may be an alternative to decrease the use of starch-rich feeds without compromising the energy levels offered by provided by a diet (Lima et al., 2015(Lima et al., , 2016)).The cattle undergoing dietary restriction for several hours may have acidosis due to an increase in the initial intake.The frequency of feed supply is important in feedlots, especially in finishing diets.In certain cases, the use of diets that restrict consumption by 90% to 95% may improve feed efficiency and minimize the chances of excessive DMI and the risk of acidosis.A gradual adaptation to the diets those are rich in starch reduces the variation in the ruminal pH during the day, which results in the maintenance of a high pH and the reduction of the risk of acidosis (Dijkstra et al., 2012).
