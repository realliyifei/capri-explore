Fields: Medicine

## (s1) Clinical definition
(p1.0) The position statement from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) working group on myocardial and pericardial diseases proposed a definition of ARVD based on histological findings. They define ARVD by "the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (global or regional) with or without left ventricular disease in the presence of histological evidence for the disease and/or electrocardiographic abnormalities" [10]. The ESC further define histological findings as progressive pathological replacement of RV myocardium by adipose and fibrous tissues usually confined to RV inflow, outflow and apex, collectively referred to as the 'triangle of dysplasia' (Figure 1), which lead to morphological and functional abnormalities in the RV myocardium. The pathological changes may also occur in the LV myocardium mimicking or leading to a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype [11]. Subsequent studies have provided similar ARVD definitions based on pathological and clinical findings. Pathologically, they define ARVD as a heart muscle disorder often familial marked by pathological replacement of RV myocardium by fibrofatty tissues and clinically by the presence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias originating from the RV that potentially leads to cardiac death mostly in young adults and athletes or ultimately may be a subtle cause of congestive heart failure [5,8,12].
## (s2) Subclinical phase
(p2.0) The subclinical or concealed phase is asymptomatic, characterized by subtle RV structural changes in the presence or absence of minor ventricular arrhythmias [1]. Sudden cardiac death maybe the first and only manifestation of the disorder mostly in young adults during intense physical exercise or sporting competitions [19]. Figure 2 illustrates typical morphological ventricular features of asymptomatic young adult who died suddenly of ARVD. In Figure 2 (A) is fourchamber view of the heart revealing myocardial fatty replacement in RV fee wall and in the translucent infundibulum while in Figure 2 (B) is a histological view of the same heart confirming fatty replacement is confined only to RV wall but absent in the LV free wall and interventricular septum.
## (s3) Overt electrical disorder
(p3.0) The subclinical phase progresses into the overt electrical disorder phase, which may present with palpitation and syncope. The most frequent clinical manifestation is symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias originating from RV usually triggered by intense exercise [12,19]. Ventricular arrhythmias maybe isolated premature beats, sustained tachycardia with left bundle branch block (LBB) morphology or ventricular fibrillation potentially causing cardiac death. During ventricular tachycardia, QRS axis and morphology suggest the site of origin. Left bundle branch block with inferior axis suggest arrhythmias originate from RV outflow tract while Left bundle branch block with supervisor axis suggests arrhythmias originate RV inferior wall [1].
## (s4) RV failure
(p4.0) The third clinical phase of ARVD is marked by RV failure caused by a progressive loss of the RV myocardium. The loss provokes global RV dysfunction but with relatively preserved LV function. Global RV dysfunction may account for severe pump failure in this clinical phase [19,22].
## (s5) Bi-ventricular failure
(p5.0) Bi-ventricular failure represent the end-stage of the progressive clinical course of ARVD. This stage is characterized by biventricular failure due to significant involvement of the LV and interventricular septum. Bi-ventricular failure may lead to congestive heart disease mimicking dilated bi-ventricular cardiomyopathy [19]. In the setting of atrial fibrillation, endocavitary mural thrombosis may occur in the atrial appendages or within aneurysms to account for thromboembolic events leading to severe contractile dysfunction often requiring cardiac transplantation [1].
## (s6) Clinical manifestations
(p6.0) Cardiologists should suspect ARVD in young adults presenting with syncope, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest or adult patients with congestive heart failure [23,24]. Besides these signs and symptoms, clinical three main clinical presentation of ARVD include arrhythmias, sudden death and heart failure.
## (s7) Arrhythmias
(p7.0) Ventricular arrhythmias ranging from isolated premature beats to tachycardia remains the primary suspicion for ARVD patients in clinical practice [24][25][26][27]. In the subclinical phase, many AVRD probands having a history of syncope may have subtle RV structural changes with or without arrhythmias, may remain undiagnosed because of the absence of other suggestive features [12,28]. Ventricular arrhythmias may cause palpitations, syncope or sudden cardiac death [29]. In ARVD patients with ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmias usually manifest with LBB morphology indicating the point of origination is the RV [5,12]. Some patients present with multiple ventricular tachycardia morphologies due to the disorder producing multiple arrhythmogenic foci [25].
## (s8) Sudden death
(p8.0) Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is an important clinical manifestation of ARVD. Although an uncommon cause of SCD, in the U.S., ARVD accounts for an estimated 5% of SCD in patients aged 65 years or below [30] and between 3% and 4% in exercise-related SCDs in young athletes [31]. In Veneto region Italy, ARVD is the most frequently encountered cause of death in clinical practice in individuals aged 35 years or below usually associated with intense exercise [6,32]. Estimated annual mortality rate of ARVD ranges from 1% with pharmacotherapy to 3% if left untreated. The suspected mechanism of ARVD-related SCD is acceleration of ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation or the degradation in functional and structural RV performance [29].
## (s9) Heart failure
(p9.0) Patients with ARVD may develop isolated right heart failure or biventricular heart failure, which usually manifest in the third and fourth decades of life [13]. ARVD is one of very few myocardial disorders in the absence of pulmonary hypertension that causes right heart failure. The mechanism of right ventricular failure is dilation, thinning of wall and continued loss of contractile function due to myocardial atrophy [29]. In ARVD, right heart failure manifests four to eight years after the occurrence of an ECG-indicated right bundle branch block (RBBB) [30]. Whereas left heart failure is uncommon in ARVD, the disorder can involve LV and induce mild changes in LV function. If ARVD causes heart failure, there is a likelihood of misdiagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy of idiopathic or viral origin [13]. In most cases, LV dysfunction in ARVD represents biventricular dysplasia, which should be distinguished from biventricular fibrotic myocarditis [33]. Distinction is important since ARVD patients a more likely to present with drug-resistance arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death and thus require other therapeutic options [29].
## (s11) Risk stratification
(p11.0) The primary objective of clinical management of ARVD patients is the prevention of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias [17]. This objective however is undermined by the lack of prospective and controlled studies evaluating clinical risk markers that can assist in predicting the appearance of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias [17,20]. Several studies [1,12,19,22] have already established that in the subclinical phase, sudden cardiac death may be the first and only manifestation of ARVD mostly in asymptomatic young adults and athletes. They indicates both diagnosed and suspected ARVD patients are at risk of sudden cardiac death even in the absence of symptoms or lethal ventricular arrhythmias. A challenging clinical dilemma is to whether to consider primary prevention, prophylactic therapy on asymptomatic ARVD patients or those with minor symptoms diagnosed during routine family screening, and whether to offer secondary prevention to ARVD patients presenting with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Moreover, ARVD is a progressive myocardial disease with an increasing risk of death overtime [20].
## (s12) Risk factors
(p12.0) The risk factors for ARVD-related sudden cardiac death reported from retrospective studies analyzing clinicopathologic factors and fatal ARVD incidents suggest young age, intense exercise or competitive sporting activities, malignant family history, extensive right ventricular disease with reduced LV ejection fraction, and LV ventricular involvement, syncope and ventricular tachycardia are significant risk factors [23,31,34,34]. There are reports of at least 80% of ARVD cases diagnosed before the age of 40 years [23] and intense exercise accounting for up to 4% of deaths in young adults [31] and significantly lower survival free of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and heart failure [35]. An estimated 20% to 30% ARVD patients have a family history of ARVD or sudden cardiac death [34] while a recent study using non-invasive tests including electrocardiography and echocardiography observe evidence of ARVD in between 30% and 50% of family members [7,36,37]. Further, there is a 50% probability that ARVD mutations in the proband will be passed to the offspring, since most genetic mutations responsible for ARVD have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with variable penetrance [38].
## (s16) Purely fatty variant
(p16.0) Corrado et al. [12,20] suggested two variants of fatty replacement of the myocardium in ARVD: the purely fatty (adipose) and the fibrofatty variants. The purely fatty variant is characterized by partial or complete fatty replacement of the myocardium without wall thinning, defined as RV free wall thickness of 4-5 mm. The fatty replacement predominantly affects the apex and infundibulum, and the lack fibrotic tissues and inflammatory infiltrates suggests the left ventricle and intraventricular septum are preserved [7,8,40]. In half of the cases of the purely fatty variant, there are reports of myocardial generation and death in the absence of other concomitant heart disease [20].
## (s17) Fibrofatty variant
(p17.0) The fibrofatty variant was the original morphological definition of ARVD. This variant is characterized by fatty infiltration associated with significant replacement by fibrotic tissues, thinning of RV free wall (wall thickness < 3mm), aneurysmal dilatation and inflammatory infiltrates [12,20]. Half of autopsy case series observe fibrofatty replacement in RV apical, inflow and outflow regions, "the triangle of dysplasia" but rarely involves the left ventricle and ventricular septum [7,12]. Corrado et al. [20] propose three basic mechanisms underlying the loss of myocardium and its replacement with fibrofatty tissues. (a) Apoptosis (programmed cell death). (b) Inflammatory cardiac conditions manifesting with a range of clinical conditions -acute myocarditis to fibrous healingthat may involve both LV and RV leading to congestive heart failure mimicking dilated cardiomyopathy. (c) Myocardial dystrophy unrelated to myocarditis suggesting inherited atrophy.
## (s20) Mechanism of genetic etiology
(p20.0) Inherited genetic mutation has been frequently cited as the dominant etiology of ARVD indicated in many studies that define ARVD as a heterogeneous hereditary myocardial disorder usually with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance [34,[44][45][46]. The suspected genetic etiopathogenesis of ARVD may be explained by a purely structural theory illustrated in Figure 4. Abnormalities in the myocardial cell-to-cell connection through contacts referred to as intercalated discs. Portion of the discs could also have abnormalities referred to as the desmosome. The desmosome disrupts the normal structure and function of desmosomal proteins leading to intercalated discs pulling apart [34,38]. Figure 3 illustrates mutations in various cardiac desmosomal genes with important roles in the etiopathogenesis of ARVD. The desmosomal cardiac genes play four important roles in the normal structure and function of myocardium. They support structural stability (cell-to-cell adhesion) (A), regulate transcription in genes involved in adipogenesis, apoptosis and in the maintenance of normal electrical conductivity (B), regulate gap junction (C) and regulation of calcium ion (Ca + ) in the extracellular fluid (D) [38]. The most affected myocardial cells are in the RV but as ARVD progress, RV becomes involved, and in rare cases, the LV might be an early or predominant site of ARVD [43]. The disruption of the normal structure of the myocardium may lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, RV dysfunction and sudden cardiac death [38].

(p20.1) Recent studies on electron microscopy have supported the purely structural theory postulating the loss of myocyte adhesion causes necrosis and fibrosis to explain genetic pathogenesis of ARVD [47,48]. The two studies report ultrastructural abnormalities of the desmosome (focal scar) linked with desmosomal gene mutations. Focal scar would lead to the characteristic ARVD-related RV arrhythmias with environmental factors such as intense exercise or inflammation cause by viral infection could stimulate the pulling apart of the desmosome and   [1] exacerbate disease progression [38]. The RV is at a higher risk of the loss of myocyte adhesion due to thinner wall and normal dilatory response to exercise. However, the structural theory fails to explain preserved LV myocardium and late onset of the disorder in some individuals having desmosomal gene mutation [38].
## (s21) Types of genetic mutations
(p21.0) Currently, five desmosomal genes have been identified that correlate with early onset of clinical symptoms and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in ARVD: plakophilin-2, desmoglein-2, desmoscollin-2, desmoplakin and plakoglobin [27,34,38]. In two studies investigating desmosomal genetic mutations and the distribution of gene defects in desmosome proteins recruiting a large series of ARVD patients, 26.7% [49] and 58% [50] had positive gene defects in desmosome proteins with plakophilin-2 being the most prevalent genetic mutation accounting for 73% [49] and 78.4% [50] as summarized in Table 1.

(p21.1) Compared to other inherited cardiomyopathic phenotypes with a single causative genetic mutation, the genetic etiology of ARVD is more complex. Patients with ARVD may have more than one genetic defect in the same gene, a condition referred to as compound heterozygosity, or more than one genetic defect in a commentary gene, referred to as digenic heterozygosity [38]. Based on heterogeneous genetic etiologies, ARVD has been classified into eleven (11) genetic variants. Table 2 provides a summary of eleven identified genetic variants of ARVD.

(p21.2) Genetic etiologies have been reported as dominant in ARVD patients but only between 30% and 50% of ARVD patients have one of the five identified genes suggesting the involvement of other notyet identified causative genes [38]. Awad et al. [38] reviewed studies on novel non-desmosomal genes, which identify genetic mutations in cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), which has been associated with pathogenesis of ARVD2 genetic variant. Mutations in RYR2 is also linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular, a disorder resembling ARVD but without RV abnormality as reported in 12 individuals [51]. Linkage analysis have reported a relationship between chromosome 1q42.1-q43 and ARVD phenotype identified in RYR2 mutations in four families [52]. However, the role of RYR2 mutations remains ambiguous because catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a separate clinical disorder with unclear clinical criteria for diagnosis. It is also not established whether catecholaminergic polymorphic and ARVD2 are disorder of different mutation of the same gene [38].

(p21.3) Regulatory mutations in TGFβ is another non-desmosomal gene mutation suspected to cause ARVD. Gene defect in TGFβ is associated with a tendency for increased production of extracellular matrix and adipogenesis [53]. Continuing studies on transgenic mice tested with available genetic mutations to provide better understanding of etiopathogenesis mechanism of genetic ARVD with the potential for therapeutic implications [54,55].
## (s25) Differential diagnosis Diagnosis criteria
(p25.0) Morphological and functional abnormalities of the RV myocardium in ARVD became apparent after the publication of the first clinical profile in 1982 based on 24 patient cases with advanced disease [6]. However, since then, ARVD has proved difficult to diagnose especially if the patient has mild or no discernible structural or functional changes to the RV myocardium. Bomma et al. [65] re-evaluated 65 patients diagnosed with ARVD based on MRI findings of intramyocardial fat or RV wall thinning from an outside institution and found none of the patients had ARVD, suggesting a high frequency of misdiagnosis especially diagnosis based purely on MRI wall thinning and fibrofatty replacement.

(p25.1) Diagnosis challenges and the lack of a gold standard or single test to diagnose ARVD informed the formation of the Task Force of the Working Group Myocardial and Pericardial Disease of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and of the Scientific Council on Cardiomyopathies of the International Society and Federation of Cardiology (ISFC). The ESC/ISFC Task Force developed the initial standardized guidelines for the diagnosis of ARVD in 1994 [66] and later revised them in 1996 [9]. Table 3 summarizes the revised Task Force criteria for the diagnosis of ARVD. The standardized criteria streamlines and simplifies diagnosis but uncertainty persists because of the lack of quantified guidelines in many criteria and the lack of reports on outcomes of evaluation of large series of newly diagnosed ARVD patients using task force criteria [67,68].

(p25.2) The ESC/ISFC Task Force diagnostic criteria emphasizes on in vivo diagnosis, whose aim is to demonstrate alterations in the RV myocardium morphology and function. The alterations include abnormalities in depolarization and repolarization, arrhythmias of the LBBB morphology, fibrofatty substitution of myocardial tissue. The criteria describe myocardial changes detected by echocardiography, angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and/or radionuclide scintigraphy as well as other diagnostic criteria such as family history of the disorder [1].

(p25.3) Diagnosis of ARVD based on the Task Force criteria relies on the presence of major and minor clinical findings from structural, histologic, electrocardiographic, arrhythmic, and genetic factors. Confirmation of the diagnosis of ARVD requires the presence of two major criteria, one major and two minor criteria or four minor criteria from different groups. These diagnostic criteria represent a useful clinical approach that is specific but may lack sensitivity ultimately requiring molecular genetic testing upon which clinical diagnosis will be based [12,67].
## (s28) Diagnosis of at-risk family members
(p28.0) Genetic testing is helpful for determining whether an individual suspected to have ARVD actually has the disorder and identifying asymptomatic relatives having inherited ARVD-associated gene defects [37]. Genetic testing for a specific mutation is recommended when diagnosis of ARVD has been established in the proband to assess possible risk of the disease in close relatives [69]. Mutation specific tests determine whether close relatives (brothers, sisters and offspring) have the same causal gene defect suggesting they are at risk of ARVD requiring periodical evaluation to determine when the disease will manifest over time. Although the lack of gene defect in close family members suggest unlikeliness of disease development, the proband may have unidentified secondary gene defects that could also cause the disease to propagate to close family members [37].
## (s30) Challenges of genetic testing
(p30.0) The complexity of genetic etiology of ARVD complicates the efficacy of genetic testing. Although the most common ARVD gene leading to clinical manifestation of ARVD is the plakophilin-2 gene,  many ARVD patients have compound heterozygosity (more than one mutation in the same gene) or digenic heterozygosity (more than one mutation in a complementary gene) [38]. The plakophilin-2 gene thus may require compound or digenic heterozygosity to manifest clinical symptoms of ARVD, which challenges the accurate determination of the causative gene defect by genetic testing [37]. Defective ARVD causative desmosomal gene has only been identified in 1 in 400 individuals yet in a Finish population-prevalence study for ARVD desmosomal mutation, 1 in 200 health individuals have desmosomal gene mutations for ARVD [73] and 6% of healthy individuals of Asian descent have an abnormal plakophilin-2 gene [50,74].

(p30.1) Genetic testing for ARVD also has challenges in result interpretation due to multiple reports of 48% of individuals diagnosed with familial ARVD having multiple mutations in the same gene [49,[75][76][77][78]. These individuals usually present with more severe signs and symptoms. Since not all ARVD-associated genes have not been identified, determination of the causative defective gene may be problematic. Family members with an unknown defective mutation in many cases may have genenegative findings. They should be considered for intermittent examinations to determine that they are not at-risk of ARVD [37]. Finally, the cost of genetic testing is high and prohibitive for many patients and/or families. An average cost of US$5,400 in the U.S. is high, which is exacerbated by some laboratories not accepting commercial insurance including Medicare or Medicaid [37].
## (s31) Endomyocardial biopsy
(p31.0) Endomyocardial biopsy presents a major criterion for the diagnosis of ARVD through in vivo characterization of RV free wall with fibrofatty substitution of the myocardium [1]. Figure 4 shows RV free wall tissue characterization by endomyocardial biopsy. Figure 4(a) shows transvenous jugular approach of the bioptome; (b) cross-section of the heart revealing septum is spared suggesting biopsy at the level of RV free wall; and (c) fibrofatty substitution in two bioptic samples.

(p31.1) Confirmatory diagnosis of ARVD usually required histological assessment of transmural fibrofatty substitution of the myocardium at necropsy through either surgery or endomyocardial biopsy. However, diagnosis of ARVD by endomyocardial biopsy is challenging because of the segmental nature of the disease and low sensitivity because biopsy involves the interventricular septum, which is rarely involved in fibrofatty substitution [20,29,66].
## (s32) Electrocardiography
(p32.0) The task force diagnostic criteria of ARVD recommend electrocardiography (abbreviated as ECG) for assessing changes in repolarization or depolarization and conduction abnormalities [9]. The recommendation is based on previous studies that demonstrated ECG recordings detect up to 90% of depolarization or repolarization abnormalities in ARVD patients [12]. Table 4 shows Task Force ECG criteria for diagnosis of familial (inherited) ARVD in the context of confirmed ARVD in a close relative (proband) [9,67].

(p32.1) The most frequently encountered repolarization abnormality in clinical practice is T-wave inversion in precordial leads V1-V3 examining the RV. Figure 5 shows ECG recordings of a 19-year old football player who suddenly died from ARVD during competitive sporting activity. T-wave abnormality range between V1-V4 and isolated premature ventricular beats with LBBB morphology [12].

(p32.2) Corrado et al. [12] links T-wave inversion with ST segment elevation <0.1 mV. The repolarization abnormalities are non-specific and considered minor diagnostic criteria because of a normal variant detected in females or children 12 years or younger, or occurs secondary to RBBB either isolated or in the context of congenital heart disease causing RV overload. The wide spectrum of ECG  abnormalities suggesting delayed RV activation includes complete/ incomplete RBBB, prolonged right precordial QRS duration and postexcitation epsilon wave. Correlational studies suggest surface ECG and epicardial mapping demonstrate ECG changes show abnormalities in intraventricular myocardium (parietal block) instead of a specialized conduction abnormality (septal block). Prolonged right precordial QRS and epsilon waves are major diagnostic features. Local prolonged QRS in V 1 -V 3 to ≥ 110 ms is a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing ARVD, accounting for 12 leads associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death [12]. Less common ECG changes include P-waves > 2.5 mV, low voltage QRS in peripheral leads and T-wave inversion in inferior lead [12].
## (s33) Imaging techniques
(p33.0) The task force criteria for diagnostic AVD recommends imaging methods for examining global or regional myocardial dysfunction and structural abnormalities. Table 5 summarizes Task Force criteria for imaging methods alongside major and minor visualized morphological global or localized dysfunction and structural alterations. Echocardiography Echocardiography is a widely used non-invasive imaging technique often always representing the first line imaging technique for assessing patients suspected to have ARVD or for screening family members to identify those developing clinical manifestations of ARVD [12]. Echocardiography also presents a method for serial examination to evaluate disease progression during follow up of ARVD patients. Echo is also an important differential diagnosis method for ARVD because it easily rules out other underlying causes of RV disorders especially Ebstein anomaly and atrial septal defect. Besides evaluation of RV wall motion and morphological abnormalities, quantitative Echo evaluation of RV including assessment of end-diastolic cavity dimensions, RV wall thickness, volume and function improves diagnostic efficacy. Such typical echo features may avoid the need for contrast angiography or even magnetic resonance imaging. However, borderline or normal Echo findings would warrant further examinations using other imaging techniques [12]. Figure 6 shows 2D echo parasternal long axis view of the RV findings in ARVD detecting the presence of typical inferior subtricuspid bulging.
## (s34) Cardiac MRI
(p34.0) Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important noninvasive imaging tool capable of characterizing tissue and distinguishing fat from muscle tissue. Fast spin or turbo spin echo are recommended for black blood imaging, which best assesses the RV free wall and outflow tract. Stack of axial images should image the entire RV by using 6-8 slices at 1 cm intervals [79]. Table 6 summarizes the recommended cardiac MRI protocol for ARVD The main challenge of cardiac MRI in imaging ARVD patients is the lack of well-defined sensitivity and specificity such that the quality of images is operator dependent and findings subject to individual interpretation (inter-observer variability) [20,79]. Marcus et al. [68] analyzed findings of American Multidisciplinary study on clinical presentation and diagnosis of ARVD and reports variation between MRI diagnosis of referral center and core laboratory. Core laboratory did not confirm 29% of diagnosis confirmed by the referral center [68]. Cine-MRI promises better detection by the ability to estimate RV volume and wall motion abnormalities due to akinesia, dyskinesia and aneurysms [1]. Figure 7 shows cardiac MRI four-chamber and short-axis imaging planes of ARVD patient with predominant RV abnormalities. The left panels show end-diastolic and right panel end-systolic. The arrow in the 4-chamber end-diastolic image shows subtricuspid dyskinesia while arrows in the short axis images show RV free wall aneurysm -systolic and diastolic bulging.
## (s37) RV angiography
(p37.0) Many experts still consider right ventricular (RV) angiography as a diagnostic method of choice for assessing RV function [29]. The imaging technique provides angiographic evidence of akinesia or dyskinesia bulging in the triangle of dysplasia ( Figure 1): infundibular, apical, and sub-tricuspid regions, with a high diagnostic specificity > 90% [14,69]. Prominent dilation akinesia accompanied by irregular aspect usually involving inferior RV wall have a significant association with ARVD diagnosis. Recommended RV angiography best evaluates by bi-plane angiography obtaining views in the 450 right anterior oblique and 450 left anterior oblique during sinus rhythm [29]. However, same to cardiac MRI, RV angiography suffers from significant inter-observer variability [12].
## (s40) Study outcomes
(p40.0) The findings reveal diagnosis of ARVD depends on a combination of methods assessing functional and structural alterations in the myocardium. The most common method was electrocardiography abnormalities adopted by 50% (half) of the studies, followed by cardiac MRI by 33.3% echocardiography by 16.7%, endomyocardial biopsy by 11% and finally cardiac computed tomography by 5.5%. the ECG method measured conduction (depolarization or repolarization) abnormalities such as Prolonged S-wave upstroke in V1-V3; Epsilon wave; prolonged QRS duration; T-wave inversion in V1-V3 [83], localized right precordial QRS prolongation (98%); Epsilon waves; T wave inversions [84], QRS fragmentation Epsilon potential [84,86]. Echocardiography assessed both functional and morphological myocardial alterations: RV diastolic dimension [6], RV dimensions and fractional area changes [89] and RV enlargement [90]. Cardiac MRI assessed morphological changes: myocardial fibrofatty changes [94,95], intramyocardial wall thinning [65] and RV enlargement/size and location of fibrofatty depositions [92]. Endomyocardial biopsy assessed fatty tissues but was more accurate for differential diagnosis to detect and exclude myocarditis, which mimics ARVD.
## (s42) Clinical management
(p42.0) Whereas the ESC/IFSC Task Force has developed standardized diagnostic guidelines, ARVD lacks well-defined and widely accepted guidelines for clinical management. The current guidelines developed from a review of literature categorizes clinical management into symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and with or without family history of ARVD. Figure 9 provides a schematic illustration of the proposed clinical management guidelines for ARVD.

(p42.1) An important goal of clinical management of ARVD is to prevent sudden cardiac death. According to Thiene et al. [1], prevention of cardiac death in ARVD patients should focus on eradication of the disease using ICD, a reduction of sporting (exertional physical exercises) and the use of medical therapy to manage sustained arrhythmias. Figure 10 illustrates the four main clinical approaches to prevent sudden cardiac death in ARVD patients.
## (s43) Genetic counselling
(p43.0) Genetic counselling is considered for patients diagnosed or suspected to have familial (inherited) ARVD. A genetic counsellor should be trained in medical genetics and counselling to assist physicians and patients in the genetic testing process. Counselling usually involves a review of diagnosis, detailed family history and cost, and discussion of tests carried out. Genetic testing assists patients to understand the underlying reasons causing the disease, prognosis and any risk the condition poses to close family members [34]. Genetic testing informs the consideration of prevention of triggers such as intense exercise activities [1].
## (s44) Pharmacotherapy
(p44.0) Clinical findings predicting long-term outcome of ARVD patients remains unclear and exact guidelines to select patients requiring pharmacotherapy are lacking. Methods to predict prognosis of pharmacotherapy remains undefined or efficacy in the prevention of ARVD-associated sudden cardiac death unproven [20]. However, the few studies that have evaluated therapy for asymptomatic ARVD patients having focused on mild morphologic RV abnormalities in the absence of any discernible evidence of ventricular arrhythmias [29]. In these patients, β-adrenergic blocking agents are recommended for the reduction of possible adrenergic stimulated arrhythmias [29]. Pharmacotherapy using β-blockers and class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs is considered the initial treatment for ARVD patients with tolerated and mild ventricular arrhythmias [12,20]. In ARVD patients presenting with arrhythmias including non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia or premature ventricular complex, or symptoms, the initial therapy should be β-blockers or antiarrhythmic drug therapy based on programmed ventricular stimulation with serial drug testing [20,29]. Current evidence indicates Sotalol or amiodarone (has both antiarrhythmic and β-blocking properties) alone or in combination with β-blockers show promising results with low proarrhythmic risk [80]. Although current efficacy of pharmacotherapy depends on symptom improvement, a more reliable approach should include treatment guidance by serial monitoring by 24-hour Holter monitoring and/or stress testing to demonstrate a reduction of arrhythmic events [29].
## (s48) Search criteria
(p48.0) Studies examining clinical management of ARVD and recorded parameters related to treatment outcomes of ARVD were searched and examined [1]. There was no time limitation or age of patients included in this meta-analysis. Electronic search engines used to identify relevant studies were PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane. Relevant medical subject headings (MESH) terms and a combination of key words used were arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) AND "medication" OR "counselling" OR "ablation" OR "implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator [ICD]".
## (s49) Study selection
(p49.0) Study selection used a three-level hierarchical search. The first level of selection included screening of authors, titles and abstracts. This first level selection excluded case studies (involving one or a few ARVD patients) animal studies and conference papers (still subject to revision) as well as compared abstracts to the inclusion criteria: (a) studies examined ARVD patients; (b) included at least one clinical management methods; and (c) reported outcomes on clinical management. Age of patients or time of publication was not a criteria for inclusion. After selection, relevant data was extracted from all the included studies. The extracted data was recorded in Microsoft Excel Worksheet. The extracted data included first author, year of publication, number of patients (sample), clinical end-pint studies, outcomes (survival/improvement) and a summary of study findings. Table 8 lists a summary of data on clinical management of ARVD from the included studies Study Characteristics After a review of titles, abstract and reading of the entire article against the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 12 studies investigating various clinical management methods of ARVD patients were included for analysis. The studies were published between 1988 and 2011. The bulk of the studies (50%) examined implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) [82,[99][100][101][102][103][104] while the remaining examined radiofrequency ablation (25%) [104][105][106], and pharmacotherapy (25%) [107-109] In total, the 12 studies investigated 644 ARVD patients.
## (s50) Study outcomes
(p50.0) The seven studies on ICD therapy demonstrate ARVD patients have good toleration and the therapy provides long-term life-saving protection by preventing lethal ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation or flutter. Further, ICD with non-thoracotomy leads is safe and efficacious in ARVD patients by reducing cases of perforation [101]. Whereas radiofrequency ablation has favorable short-term outcomes by preventing ventricular tachycardia (VT), there is significance recurrence of VT in the longterm because of diffuse nature of ARVD and evolving electrical substrate [104][105][106]. Finally, pharmacotherapy involving β-blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs offer favorable prognosis in the short-term [107-109]. Amiodarone has been shown to have superior protective effect against VT compared to β-blockers and Sotalol [107]. β-blockers taken with amiodarone and programmed electrical stimulation offer better protection against VT [109]. Finally, ICD together with pharmacotherapy provides long-term life-saving protection against VT [104].
