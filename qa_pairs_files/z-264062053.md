## (s1) Research questions and method
(p1.0) Inspired by the importance of green fashion consumption and our limited understanding of the topic, this research seeks to summarise and assess the literature related to green and sustainable clothing consumption by addressing the following research questions:

(p1.1) • What are the general characteristics of the articles published in the literature?Based on the initial literature survey, we found only a limited number of articles that provide a review of the existing literature or suggest future research directions based on state-of-the-art in the field.For example, Tey et al. (2018) explored the willingness to pay for sustainable apparel in 2018 using only 12 articles.Mukendi et al. (2020) reviewed the literature on sustainable fashion in 2020 by analysing a significantly larger sample of 465 papers and focusing on a much broader topic, where the results showed seven study streams that cover every discipline, to investigate whether consumer and organisational behaviour might be transformed for the future.They identified seven relevant scientific inquiry clusters: supply chains, social retail marketing (SRM), consumer behaviour, consumer practices and communities, social marketing interventions, future leaders, and sustainable business models.The objective of the present review falls within the scope of these two studies.It aims to explore the literature findings regarding the factors that influence sustainable clothing consumption.

(p1.2) The review focused on English language journal articles available in the Web of Science (WOS) database falling in the categories of economics, business, finance, social science, management, and environmental science.Since only very few, sporadic articles were published on the topic before 2011, we considered articles from a tenyear period between 2011 and 2021.
## (s3) Research problems, theories and methods used 3.2.1 Research problems addressed in the literature
(p3.0) After reviewing the selected articles, six distinct research topics emerged.Most articles focus on green and sustainable textile consumption (about half of all the articles).In contrast, others examine more specific behaviour related to textile consumption, as shown in Table 3.

(p3.1) According to our results, the concepts of slow fashion, collaborative fashion and circular fashion are gaining interest in the literature and concrete actions relating to these,   such as the purchasing of second-hand fashion products and the reuse, repair, and recycling of garments.For instance, Legere and Kang (2020) investigated the function of self-concept as a motivator in choices regarding slow fashion.They used perceived self-enhancement benefits as a mediating variable between the dependent variablebehavioural intentions toward slow fashion -and the independent variables -effects of moral self-identity and proximity of apparel.The findings of their study suggest that customers' desires for transformation and self-enhancement by symbolic behaviour in social situations may be driving forces behind slow fashion consumption.Perceived benefits of self-improvement and behavioural intentions were directly influenced by symbolic moral identity, but not by internalised moral identity.Mohammad et al. (2021) conducted a study to investigate the mediating role of attitudes toward used clothing and the direct and indirect effects of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on mindful consumption behaviour (MCB) in the context of sustainable clothing purchases.The findings of this study lend credence to the direct influence of eWOM on consumer involvement, awareness, and attitudes towards used clothing.The findings confirmed the link between MCB and consumer involvement, but they did not confirm the relationship between attitude and mindful consumption (MC).The study also supported the mediation role of consumer participation between eWOM and consumers' MCB, but it did not support the mediating role of attitude toward second-hand clothing.These tendencies may be able to balance or at least moderate the exponential rate of growth in the usage of textile products as experienced in developing countries in the last decades (Ekström and Salomonson, 2014).
## (s4) Theoretical background of the reviewed articles
(p4.0) We have also assessed the theories used in the literature.The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) (used by 19 out of the 104 articles analysed) explains consumer behaviour regarding the consumption of green textile products.

(p4.1) The authors found that while TPB has clear benefits, it cannot fully explain the attitude-behaviour gap in the context of sustainable fashion (Wiederhold and Martinez, 2018).Furthermore, results generated using TPB may also be limited because they are based on buying intentions rather than actual purchase behaviour (Cowan and Kinley, 2014;La Rosa and Johnson Jorgensen, 2021).

(p4.2) The strongest indication of environmentally friendly buying behaviour in the future is one of the components of the theory of planned behaviour, namely attitude toward environmentally friendly clothing and social problems (Cowan and Kinley, 2014).

(p4.3) Vilkaite-Vaitone and Jeseviciute-Ufartiene (2021) employed TPB by using attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and information provided as independent variables while examining textile recycling intentions.They concluded that the primary motivator for textile recycling in Lithuanian homes is perceived behavioural control.While perceived behavioural control, subjective norm, and attitude toward behaviour were all powerful determinants of behaviour, information provision turned out to be less important.In their study, the traditional framework of planned behaviour, rather than the extended model, was more suitable for estimating the willingness to recycle textile waste.The research by Cowan and Kinley (2014) used the theory of planned behaviour with independent variables: belief factors, normative influence factors, and perceived behavioural control factors to explain purchase intentions towards environmentally friendly apparel.The result showed that all these factors impact purchase intentions.Another research by Lang and Joyner Armstrong (2018) utilised the same theory.Their independent variable was fashion leadership, and the mediating variables were attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, and clothing renting and swapping was the dependent variable.They found a significant influence of fashion leadership on the purchase decision of clothing items.They also identified a positive relationship between the independent and mediating variables.These findings supported the hypothesis that fashion leadership with attitude and subjective norms are positively correlated with overall intention to adopt sustainable clothing product-service systems (CPSS).This study is unique in various ways, including the extension of the TPB model to include fashion leadership as an external component.Iran et al. (2019) used the theory of planned behaviour and Hofstede's national cultural factors with independent variables: attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural Slow/fast fashion purchase behaviour 7
## (s5) Research methods used
(p5.0) Most studies on green and sustainable textile consumption utilize quantitative research approaches (70 out of 104 articles), although qualitative research methods have also been used (26 articles), with some studies employing several diverse research approaches (8 articles).

(p5.1) Ekström and Salomonson ( 2014) followed qualitative research approaches in their work, and an exploratory qualitative study was done by Ruppert-Stroescu et al. (2015), qualitative semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted by Wiederhold and Martinez (2018).Quantitative research approaches were followed in La Rosa and Johnson Jorgensen's (2021) research and in Vilkaite-Vaitone and Jeseviciute-Ufartiene's (2021) research to identify the sustainable clothing purchase behaviour of consumers.

(p5.2) Different studies used various techniques to accomplish their research objectives.For instance, an experimental design was employed to measure consumers' purchase intentions in a survey by Rolling et al. (2021) when exploring how customer attitudes toward luxury brand and product use cases affect consumers' cognitive dissonance, which affects brand attitudes and purchase intentions.A self-administered online survey was carried out in different studies by Moon and Lee (2018).The authors conclude that the connection between environmentally friendly materials and a fast-fashion fashion brand is essential for consumers.Besides this, a relationship between the parent brand and the sustainable extension boundary.According to the findings, consumers' perceptions of the fit between the original fast fashion brand and the new sustainable line improve when they perceive an integration of sustainability aspects into fast fashion.Furthermore, consumers' evaluations of the extension line's cause-effectiveness worth and monetary value influenced the purchase intention and paying the higher price.This means that customers consider a fast-fashion brand's sustainable construction line more when they think a buying from the new sustainable line to be helpful to themselves and the community.
## (s11) Knowledge and understandings
(p11.0) Environmental knowledge, Eco-fashion awareness. of moral self-identity and proximity of clothing (Legere and Kang, 2020).The study by Wei and Jung (2017) stated that the product value, face savings with the product value and green value have positive influence whereas green value has negative influence on the green clothing purchase behavior.Some other studies where consumers' greenwashing concerns, perceived aesthetic risk (Rausch and Kopplin, 2021) and social media, eco-friendly behaviour and environmental concerns for fashion production (Salem and Alanadoly, 2021) have positive influence on green clothing purchase behavior.
## (s12) Knowledge and experience
(p12.0) A study by Dhir et al. (2021) revealed that green trust, labelling satisfaction, and environmental attitude were positively correlated with green clothing purchase decisions.Moreover, green trust, environmental concern, and environmental perspective facilitate some of the suggested associations, whereas age and gender moderate the correlation between environmental issues and environmental consideration.According to the findings, quality expectations and purchasing intention were typically lower for apparel than for durables and fast-moving consumer product bundles (Magnier et al., 2019).Previous environmentally responsible behaviour inspired the purchase of sustainably sourced clothing.Surprisingly, green clothing awareness and social influences did not affect natural clothing purchasing behaviour (Khare and Varshneya, 2017).Some factors influence purchase motivations which are associated with ecological perceptions, ecological awareness and knowledge, social pressure to respond in an environmentally responsible manner, ecologic feelings, perceived environmental consequences, previous purchases of ecologically responsible apparel, affordability, and expenses of environmentally responsible clothing (Cowan and Kinley, 2014).

(p12.1) Other studies demonstrated the importance of apparel sustainability knowledge and personal values (Su et al., 2019), green knowledge (Khare and Kautish, 2021), environmental awareness (Polajnar Horvat and Šrimpf Vendramin, 2021), and attitude towards sustainable textile products (Rausch and Kopplin, 2021) and awareness of eco-fashion (Cairns et al., 2022).
