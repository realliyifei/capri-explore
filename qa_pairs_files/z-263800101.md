## (s2) Discussion
(p2.0) OKs are one of the main features of the patients with NBCCS and it was found that all cases of NBCCS had at least 1 OK in the jaws.Evans et al. and Kimonis et al. established the diagnostic criteria for the NBCCS in 1973 and according to their classification, presence of 2 major or 1 major and 2 minor criteria is necessary for the confirmation of BCNS (Evans et al., 1991, Kimonis et al., 1997).Following the modifications after the 1st International Colloquium of NBCCS criteria, presence of rib anomalies is changed as minor criterion and presence of medulloblastoma is changed as major criterion (Kimonis et al., 1997).
