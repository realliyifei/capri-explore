## (s4) Botrytis cinerea
(p4.0) Under favourable conditions, Botrytis cinerea Pers. (Bc), the anamorph of Botryotinia fuckeliana (de Bary) Whetzel, causes the devastating grey mould disease on tomato. This ascomycete belongs to the cosmopolitan Botrytis genus (family Sclerotiniaceae), which infects over 200 host plants cultivated both in greenhouse and field, including ornamental and wild species [93]. Bc may cause yield losses of tomato in some countries of the Mediterranean region, both under protected cultivation and in open field, although the damages occurring inside greenhouses are more serious [94][95][96]. Tomato yield loss accounts to around 20% [20,97], but it may reach up to 40% under optimal environmental conditions (mild temperatures between 15 and 20 • C and relative humidity above 90%) [18]. Severe infections might also develop under protected conditions when combinations of high temperature (25 • C), stem wounds, and high concentration of air-borne conidia occur [20].

(p4.1) The typical symptoms caused on tomato by Bc are soft rots, water soaking of parenchyma tissues, and grey masses of conidia ( Figure 3), while stem lesions may lead to complete plant collapse [98,99].

(p4.2) The most sensitive organs, such as stems, flowers, and fruits, may be infected through cultivation and pruning practices or by direct fungus penetration [100][101][102]. Conversely, soft rots of ripe tomato fruits occur mainly in post-harvest, while "ghost spot" symptoms related to a host defence response against this pathogen can arise on unripe fruits, making them hardly marketable [99].

(p4.3) Transmission of this necrotrophic fungus occurs mainly through air-borne conidia originating from infected plants of tomato or other hosts, or through plant debris [101], while no evidence of seed-transmission has been reported. Bc may overwinter as sclerotia in the soil and in decayed plant residues that will last till the following growing season [103].
## (s13) Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus
(p13.0) Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is the type member of the genus Orthotospovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. TSWV particles are spherical or pleomorphic, with a diameter of about 80-120 nm, enveloped by a double-layer lipoprotein membrane; the membrane presents numerous pyriform protrusions of 5-10 nm, which are composed of glycoproteins. Regarding its genomic composition, TSWV presents a multipartite genome composed by three negative/ambisense single-stranded RNA molecules [222].
## (s14) Cucumber Mosaic Virus
(p14.0) Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is the type member of the genus Cucumovirus of the family Bromoviridae [232]. The virions are constituted of three icosahedral particles with a diameter of about 29 nm. The CMV genome is composed of three segments of positive single-stranded RNA, called RNA-1, RNA-2, and RNA-3. Another RNA molecule, called RNA-4, is generated by RNA-3. RNA1 encodes the 1a protein, which, together with the RNA-2-encoded 2a protein, forms the replicase complex; RNA-2 also encodes a second protein, 2b, which is involved with the long-distance movement. RNA-3 encodes two proteins, 3a, a cell-to-cell movement protein (MP), and 3b, the coat protein (CP), which facilitates cell-to-cell movement and virus transmission [233]. Some particular virus strains support the replication of a fifth non-genomic RNA segment called Carna 5, a satellite RNA that can modify symptom expression [234]. The presence of numerous CMV strains with a high genetic variability is thought to explain the extremely wide variety of symptoms that can make diagnosis difficult in some cases.

(p14.1) Currently, according to serological and molecular characteristics, all strains are grouped into two subgroups: Cucumber mosaic virus subgroup I-strain Fny (CMV-Fny) and subgroup II-strain Q (CMW-Q). Furthermore, subgroup I is divided into IA and IB [235]. Specifically, subgroup IA includes isolates that induce a generalized mosaic, while subgroup IB includes all the Asian isolates that induce necrotic lesions on leaves. Being a very adaptable virus with high evolutionary capacity, CMV may infect more than 1200 plant species and may be transmitted by more than 80 aphid species in a circulative, non-persistent manner [236,237]. Transmission efficiency varies according to the aphid species, virus strain, host species, and environmental conditions. In particular, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer), cotton or melon aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover), black bean aphid (A. fabae Scop.), cowpea aphid (A. craccivora Koch.), and potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae Thomas) are the most efficient vectors. Moreover, CMV can also be transmitted by seeds [238] and through ten species of dodder.
## (s15) Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus and Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Sardinia Virus
(p15.0) Several studies conducted in some Mediterranean countries, including Italy, have shown that there are at least two viruses responsible for the Tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) [244,245], i.e., Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), and that genetic recombination between members of these species occurs frequently, giving rise to a wide range of new hybrid genomes [246,247].
## (s17) Tomato Mosaic Virus
(p17.0) Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is the second economically important tomato infecting virus within the genus Tobamovirus (family Virgaviridae). ToMV consists of rigid and rod-shaped particles measuring approximately 300 × 15 nm. Its genome consists of a non-segmented single-stranded positive RNA (ssRNA+) molecule of approximately 6.380 nt [232]. The genome encodes four proteins, among which the 184 and 126 kDa proteins are involved in viral replication. The 184 kDa protein is the only protein required for virus replication, whereas the 126 kDa protein contains a methyltransferase and a helicase domain and increases the efficiency of replication. The ORFs positioned at the 3 -end of the genomic RNA encode the movement protein (MP), involved in the cell-to-cell movement, and the coat protein (CP) [263]. The virions can be found in all plant organs, including the pollen and seeds, probably except from the embryo.

(p17.1) ToMV is spread throughout the Mediterranean region and other areas where tomato is cultivated [281][282][283][284]. It can infect several different species, but its main hosts belong to the family Solanaceae, mainly tomato and pepper plants, where the yield can undergo reduction between 25-70% [55,56].

(p17.2) On tomatoes, the symptoms may depend on pedo-climatic conditions, age of the plant, virus strain and tomato cultivar. Therefore, leaf green spot mosaic with yellow or white spots and discolouration of the leaf veins can be frequently observed ( Figure 14).
## (s18) Parietaria Mottle Virus
(p18.0) Parietaria mottle virus (PMoV) was identified and characterised for the first time in 1987 in the Turin area (Piedmont region of Italy) on Parietaria officinalis L. plants that showed a marked leaf mottling [292]. A variant of the virus, named TI-1 (Tomato-Ilarvirus-1), was identified in 1971 on tomato plants in the same geographical area [293]. PMoV is a member of the genus Ilarvirus within the family Bromoviridae. It has a single tripartite positive RNA genome; the RNA1 is monocistronic and encodes the protein 1a, whereas the RNA2 is bicistronic and encodes a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (protein 2a), and the protein 2b, which is expressed through a subgenomic RNA (RNA4). The RNA3 (2.700 nt) is bicistronic and encodes the movement protein (MP) and the coat protein (CP). The 1a and 2a proteins are involved in genome replication and internal transcription of the subgenomic RNA4 (1.100 nt) [294]. PMoV is constantly detected on tomatoes in some Mediterranean countries, such as Spain, France and Greece [58]. The disease incidence varies between 3 and 30%, but it is possible that up to now the real PMoV incidence has been underestimated, due to the confusion generated by similar symptoms caused by other viruses (TSWV, ToMV and CMV).

(p18.1) The most evident symptom on tomato consists in the alteration of the fruit pigmentation: at the beginning of the disease, the immature fruits show greenish translucent rings with more intense colour shades compared to the background, whereas the ripe and mature fruits show chlorotic rings. Within a short period of time, these rings become brownish, generally in relief, more or less corky and coalescent, causing the deformation of the fruits; some fruits can show the surface almost entirely covered by corky ring formations ( Figure 15).
## (s22) Future Prospects
(p22.0) Horticulture plays a key role in the economy of countries with a temperate climate. Unfortunately, horticultural crops are affected by several diseases, compromising the economic return of the farmers. In this context, better crop protection strategies require a close synergy between the research community, seed companies, and farmers, trying to fulfil needs of consumers interested in healthy products of high quality.

(p22.1) Here, we have outlined the major and most dangerous pathogens that affect tomato crop in the Mediterranean area and their effects on the cultivation of this important horticultural crop. Considering the tremendous impacts of pesticides on water quality and plants and animals and their linkage with several negative effects on human health, including short-term sickness and several kind of cancers; sustainable agricultural practices, such as crop rotation, precocious detection and prompt eradication of infected plants; and use of resistant varieties, certified propagation material, or chemical prophylaxis against insect vectors, are all strategies useful to contain pathogen infections and reduce the use of pesticides. Nonetheless, innovative strategies of pathogen containment must be adopted at the global level to implement a transition towards sustainable agricultural practices and sustainable living behaviours based on lower pesticide inputs and reduced food loss and food waste. Promising strategies also include the adoption of innovative cultural practices and innovative lighting sources to optimize plant growth. In particular, the technologies based on LEDs are particularly attractive for indoor cultivation of horticultural crops, eliciting not only photomorphogenic and biochemical traits but also physiological responses suitable to counteract pathogen attack [354].

(p22.2) From the biotechnological point of view, one of the biological mechanisms useful to obtain resistance to pathogens relies on RNA-mediated resistance and is specifically based on post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), taking part in the natural and complex process universally known as RNA silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) [355]. In this context, new genetic engineering techniques are available to induce plant defence against pathogens, through the so-called Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS), making use of RNAibased gene constructs to introduce stable genetic resistance in plants by triggering PTGS. Such gene constructs normally include short-inverted sequences homologous to pathogen genes, usually split by a non-coding sequence, such as an intron. As a whole, these socalled hairpin RNA (hpRNA) constructs are under the control of specific promoters and terminators [356,357].

(p22.3) Recently, as an alternative tool to the stable integration of hpRNA-based gene constructs in plants, a new technique named Spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS) is being explored. SIGS consists in the topical application of small RNA molecules (sRNAs) to plants. SIGS has great and innovative potential for crop defence against different plant pathogens and pests and is expected to raise less public/political concerns compared to the use of plants genetically modified with hpRNA constructs, as it does not alter the genetic structure of the plant. After the first pioneering work by Tenllado and Díaz-Ruíz [358] reporting the successful application of exogenous dsRNAs against three different viruses, all with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome, several studies have been conducted also on viruses with different genomic structures, as recently reviewed in Dalakouras and co-workers [359].
