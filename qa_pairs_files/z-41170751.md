## (s10) CONClUsION
(p10.0) Over the past two decades CT scanning rates have increased greatly, and this has increased the average radiation dose delivered to paediatric patients. This literature review has found that medical practitioners are not adequately aware of the stochastic effects of CT, or of diagnostic alternatives to CT. Because of the stochastic effects of ionising radiation, dose reduction in CT examinations, especially for paediatric patients, must occur. Dose reduction is being implemented by CT manufacturers, but medical imaging professionals must not rely on this alone. Improvements to CT protocols, referral practices and imaging professionals' education are needed realize that CT scans increase the lifetime risk of cancer. They also reported that radiologists are unable to provide accurate estimates of CT dose regardless of their level of experience [27] .
