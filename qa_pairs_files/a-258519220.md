## (s2) | PHAG E RE S E ARCH TO IMPROVE FOOD SAFE T Y
(p2.0) Since discovery of bacteriophage by Francis Type of circuit and Walter d'Herelle a century earlier, researchers have shown that phages can cure microbial enterococcus illnesses like cholera, correctly selected, and giardiasis in addition to a diversity of acute or prolonged pathogens in fields like cardiology, gastroenterology, cardiology, neonatology, and multiple surgeries (Wittebole et al., 2014). Since then, such infectious beings have been utilized for a variety of farming applications, as well as for animal and human uses, even though to our understanding, advertising bacteriophage therapy on local food have never been recorded (Sillankorva et al., 2012). Fresh produce-related episodes of contaminated food have highlighted the importance of practical methods to eliminate harmful bacteria from food. It has been demonstrated that traditional commercial sanitizers fail to eliminate harmful bacteria from either the skins of fruits and vegetables (Bhardwaj et al., 2015).

## (s5) | Bacteriophage to control Listeria monocytogenes contamination
(p5.0) The identification and eradication of L. monocytogenes is crucial to guaranteeing the chain's safety, particularly in RTE meals, since it may live and develop at the normal low level (2-8°C) employed numerous foods throughout their storage and distribution.

(p5.1) Accordingly, several studies have demonstrated that using bacteriophages on a variety of foods, notably RTE meals, is beneficial for lowering L. monocytogenes infection. As contrasted to vanillin and salt lactose there at ambient usage level of 6-8°C, a commercialized monophase preparations (i.e., phage preparedness comprising about one solitary bacteriophage) against Listeria was demonstrated to be higher successful in reducing the concentrations of L. monocytogenes in sliced ham (Selle et al., 2020). The same monophage preparation was demonstrated to be efficient in reducing L. monocytogenes on the superficial of various deli meats. Roast beef and turkey slices were frozen at 4 and 10°C, respectively. The Listeria specific phage not only acted as a stand-alone L. monocytogenes inhibitor but also improved the efficiency of other antimicrobials when coupled with potassium lactate or sodium diacetate (Chibeu et al., 2013).

(p5.2) All of these research utilized the same bacteriophage preparation. A realistic way to include a larger variety of mark species also reduce the possibility that resilient microorganisms would arise is to combine numerous bacteriophages to produce a "phage cocktail." In certain goods that had been intentionally dirtied through L. monocytogenes, such as lettuce, cured salmon, Gali apples pieces, and hard pasteurized cheese, the levels of the pathogen decreased by 0.7-1.1 logs when the technique was applied. The effect of the L. monocytogenes-specific cocktail on pre-made, freezer meals was investigated in the same experiment. Cycles of freezing and thawing, phage cocktail treatment, and an experimental L. monocytogenes infection were all applied to the meals. The findings revealed a 2.2 log decrease in L. monocytogenes, indicating possessing of bacteriophage might be a useful strategy for reducing L. monocytogenes in food below "storage abuse" circumstances, such as frequently defrosted throughout stowage, either intentionally or unintentionally (Perera et al., 2015).

## (s9) | Bacteriophage to control E. coli contamination
(p9.0) According to recent investigations, fresh vegetables, fresh milk polluted with E. coli, and (UHT) preserved milk have all been effectively treated utilizing E. coli-specific phage formulations. One phage dramatically abridged amount of E. coli O157:H7 on spinach leaves and green pepper slices through around 1-4 logs in the initial research.

(p9.1) The initial decline persisted at 4°C, but there was significant regrowth on 25°C. When two or three phages were coupled in the retrial, the prevalence of E. coli was reduced to extremely low levels in both UHT and unpasteurized milk. In contrast to samples treated with the two-phage cocktail, where it started to develop again, the E. coli strain continued to diminish in all samples treated with the three-phage preparation during storage at both 4 and 25°C. Despite the fact that the fundamental details are not completely tacit, the three-phage cocktail probably managed resistance better than a two-phage cocktail (Tomat et al., 2014). In the past, multi-phage cocktails have been proven to be more effective. The underlying causes of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated.

## (s10) | Bacteriophage to control Shigella spp. contamination
(p10.0) Currently, the FDA has only authorized one food safety phage preparation that exclusively targets Shigella spp. It was awarded the GRAS certification in 2017 (GRN 672) for this five-phage cocktail after it remained exposed that the heights of Shigella were decreased through around 1 log in a variety of foods, including lettuce, yoghurt, smoked salmon, deli corned beef, melons and chicken breast meat.

(p10.1) In a different study, the same combination of Shigella specific bacteriophages was used to assess the efficacy of giving phages against pharmaceuticals to mice exposed to a Shigella sonnei strain (Soffer et al., 2017). The results of the above research showed that although the Shigella-specific phages concoction was similarly efficient as just a basic antimicrobial at lowering the amount of bacteria in mice, antimicrobial therapy substantially altered the uniqueness of the cursor bowel society, so although viral diagnosis was doing not. Retroviral management thus was much fairly mild consequence just on mice's regular gut bacteria than antibiotic therapy was doing. The researcher's observations show that the phage had no negative effects on the mice's weight, morbidity, mortality, or any other physiological characteristics. Both the mice's blood and urine contained the same elements as before (Mai et al., 2015).

## (s11) | Bacteriophage to control Campylobacter contamination
(p11.0) Prior to the discovery of antibiotics, efforts were made to treat patients using bacteriophages. Bacteriophages have two life cycles, lysogenic and lytic, which may be used in therapeutics. Bacteriophages are characterized by their specificity, which allows them to selectively work against certain bacteria while having no negative effects on the surrounding flora, which is crucial for the advancement of human health. On the other hand, this uniqueness causes certain issues with phage therapy's immunity problem and also necessitates very specialized techniques (Bragg et al., 2014;Hashempour-Baltork et al., 2019;Lin et al., 2017). The potential to decrease Campylobacter adulteration of numerous foods has been investigated for some of the Campylobacter bacteriophages that have been inaccessible from chickens, counting their feces and the surface and internal tissues of their livers (Hammerl et al., 2014). For instance, Hammerl and colleagues discovered a significant reduction (3 logs) in Campylobacter fecal levels when two phages were delivered consecutively to 20-day-old chicks (a Group III phage, then a Group II phage). It's noteworthy to note that the Group III phage was unsuccessful when given unaided or in combination through additional Group III phage, signifying that a mix of Group II and III phages was obligatory for maximal efficiency. Campylobacter-specific phages have previously been isolated from a small number of Campylobacter isolates, with many investigations using the single isolate of C. jejuni NCTC 12662

(p11.1) as the host strain. The discovery of several Group III phages, the majority of which target the capsular polysaccharide, a specific receptor, was made possible by that one strain. On the other hand, Group II phages that enter through the flagella are often seen on C. jejuni RM1221 (Sørensen et al., 2015).
