Fields: Computer Science, Medicine, Engineering, Environmental Science

## (s3) Management and Security
(p3.0) Management solutions must show grounds for efficient control of IoT systems. Sinche et al. [30] proposed a taxonomy related to IoT device management, and Perera et al. [36] surveyed a wide selection of techniques, methods, models, and solutions related to context awareness in IoT. Some authors have proposed taxonomies for security approaches in the adoption of IoT technologies and applications [46]. Using autonomic terminology, Ashraf and Habaebi [53] proposed a taxonomy that aims to group IoT security vulnerabilities and their mitigation solutions. Haron et al. [37] proposed a taxonomy of trustworthiness for IoT sensor data. Based on the notion of trust, semantics, Kotis et al. [54] presented an effective modeling approach towards supporting IoT entities' selection and deployment. Alsamani and Lahza [55] studied the relationship between object characteristics, security, and privacy, and they proposed a taxonomy to categorize potential security threats in IoT. In Zhang et al. [56], the authors presented an extensive analysis of data security and privacy threats, protection technologies, and security solutions for edge computing. Oteafy and Hassanein [57] proposed a taxonomy of edge-IoT systems designed for rapid data acquisition.

(p3.1) Other studies have focused on network architecture for IoT and IoE. Thota et al. [58] studied the emerging communication techniques for the implementation of IoE applications. Gluhak et al. [38] provided a taxonomy for the scope and architecture of testbeds in the IoT. Naha et al. [59] proposed a taxonomy considering the requirements of the fog computing paradigm. In Hassan et al. [60], a taxonomy of edge computing classifies and categorizes existing edge computing paradigms for IoT. Ahad et al. [61] provided a state-of-art review of 5G-and IoT-enabled smart healthcare. Bellavista and Berrocal [39] presented a unified architectural model and proposed a new taxonomy after comparing solutions that had emerged for supporting the requirements of IoT applications. However, these works ignored the critical role of data flow throughout sensors and actuators of different types, how they collaborate to create value in cyberspace, and the context of observations.

LLM judge: YES

## (s5) Data Analysis
(p5.0) Many studies have focused on information flow, ranking information, and quality of data for the data-driven perspective and analytics applications. Bisdikian et al. [68] presented a framework for categorizing information products based on their value of information attributes. Different works have paved the way for effective utilization of the available opportunities in big data analytics and IoT. Shah et al. [69] created a thematic taxonomy for deploying these solutions collaboratively to provide guidelines for harvesting, transmitting, managing, and analyzing disaster data from diverse data sources in order to deliver valuable information to assist disaster management environments.

(p5.1) Focusing on successfully understanding and extracting value and insights from data analysis, [70,71], and [72] proposed semantic web techniques for better representation and exploration of sensor data. Qanbari et al. [71] incorporated semantic and linked data technologies to increase data quality. In [72], Rozsa et al. presented a taxonomy that identifies and categorizes sensors as the source devices to support publishing, discovery, sharing, reuse, and integration of sensed data.

LLM judge: YES

## (s9) Proposed IoE Taxonomy
(p9.0) This section presents the proposed IoE taxonomy. For the conception of this taxonomy, we selected a method proposed by Nickerson et al. [88] for taxonomy development that has been adequately addressed for taxonomy development in the information systems (IS) domain. The proposed taxonomy identifies and categorizes sensors, attributes, and characteristics that are essential for developing IoE applications. This study is the first attempt to represent the types of knowledge (from sensors and actuators) in the IoE domain and how knowledge processes lead to intelligent services in IoE applications.

(p9.1) The development of an IoE taxonomy involves determining the characteristics of the sensors in IoE applications that arise from a refinement process at various stages to sufficiently satisfy the following qualitative attributes from Nickerson et al. [88] regarding the taxonomy:

LLM judge: YES

## (s15) Trust
(p15.0) In a hybrid human-based and device-based environment, such as IoE, data's trustworthiness can be estimated mostly by the sensor nodes' reputation [37]. Trust management is a decisive challenge for data access and data storage on IoE applications [49,108].

LLM judge: YES

## (s16) Outcome
(p16.0) The IoE paradigm impacts human interaction with everyday objects. Considering the type of information exchanged between humans and the system [84], the expected outcomes from IoE applications provide multiple tiers of cognition with the fine-tuning sensory acquisition from heterogeneous contexts [57]. Distinct levels of collaboration between IoE resources require efficient solutions. Human sensors peculiarities contemplated by collaboration theory and technical aspects of user interaction are challenges in computer network theory [28]. It is imperative to provide awareness of collective intelligence and where the intelligence is [113], representing the outcomes expected in designing the IoE solutions, based on the application domain [28,104].

(p16.1) The outcome dimension refers to the degree to which knowledge sources (things and humans) contribute to knowledge creation in IoE intelligent services. Relevant knowledge contributions from human or non-human enablers (sensors or actuators) either complement or substitute (or both in some cases) to provide improved outcomes reached through knowledge sharing processes, and sometimes automating or transforming traditional tasks [55] into IoE environment disruptions:

LLM judge: YES

## (s17) •
(p17.0) Complementing: Represents knowledge sharing between IoE sensors and actuators. Complementing outcomes occurs when humans utilize mobile devices like sensors to collect their observations and information about the environment and infrastructures [25,51,65] or when artificial intelligence complements human knowledge. • Substituting: Provides insights and novel interpretation of reality to enhance the quality of life (livability), regarding knowledge acquisition as the "core element" and the realization of "intelligence" [77].

LLM judge: YES

## (s22) Use
(p22.0) Refers to the physical characteristics of physical IoE sensors or actuators related to their usage in a particular application. The devices inherit the attributes of their owners or of the entities or places [79] to which or where they are attached [43,66,113]. A wide variety of objects-a group of infrastructures and devices [44] such as embedded devices, sensors, and actuators-have integrated communication and strong interactions to create a ubiquitous environment [71,106,110]. A taxonomy for IoT sensors communicates how distinct types of sensors are combined and used in specific application domains [72].

LLM judge: NO

Violated criteria: 
- Not self-contained; lacks clear explanation or context for certain terms, such as "IoE sensors" and "IoT sensors."
  
Other issues:
- Lack of specific examples or detailed explanations for the concepts mentioned.

## (s24) •
(p24.0) Sensor: A device that observes and senses. Sensing is a read operation over a context entity. The data collected by a sensor is stored and processed intelligently to derive useful inferences and to support the decision-making process [46]. Sensors are monitor devices and physical entities, which provide the information required to immediately control actuators, whereas actuators act on the physical entity or control other things [28,35,114]. • Actuator: Affects a particular domain of the physical space or a combination of both. Actuation is a write operation over a context entity, in which the conceptual entity represents the domain of a sensor or an actuator [44]. Actuators perform the decided actions and effect a change in the environment [36,39,48]. • Sensor and actuator: This device is a hybrid of the two previous categories, and it can gather data and act within its environment.

LLM judge: YES

## (s25) Engagement
(p25.0) Participation is an interaction between people with existing technologies and occurs at different engagement levels [67]. Engagement refers to sensing tasks. In data acquisition, it can be both opportunistic and participatory, and it provides sensory information that collectively forms knowledge.

(p25.1) For example, enhancing human senses is possible when machines interact with humans or provide remote operation in perceived real time in ubiquitous computing [57,63]. Cooperative smart things can interact with other entities of the IoE in order to achieve a unified objective [15]. With mobile crowdsourcing, the primary information shared voluntarily is user knowledge and opinion, along with location as the only sensor information [65]. The engagement of a sensor node in an IoE application is one of the following:

(p25.2) • Participatory: The IoE enabler (sensor node or actuator) is actively involved and actively reports observations [120]. It can provide information about the environment or surroundings, as well as any other sensory information that could be on social groups (social sensing) or with everyone (public sensing) or at the community level [37,67,106]. • Opportunistic: The IoE node has minimal or no involvement-it senses and monitors tasks running in the background. Embedding sensors trigger the data automatically (either periodically or based on events).

LLM judge: YES

## (s28) Reach
(p28.0) Reach classification distinguishes between individual and collective knowledge. It refers to an environment of sensing interest [71]. Sensors are becoming more sophisticated in technology advances, cheaper in price, and smaller in size. This evolution stimulates large-scale deployments [36], and dense geographical distribution [60].

LLM judge: YES

## (s30) •
(p30.0) Fixed/static/immobile: Objects that remain static to a specific location or cannot move. Their observations are restricted to a specific location, in a static or very constrained (in terms of mobility) environment that is not designed to move (relative to their point of installation) without being uninstalled. • Mobile: The objects move [44], and their location may be calculated in absolute coordinates or relative to reference nodes in the network [81], requiring wireless communications to transmit data and allow configuration and control [113]. Their movement and mobility capability are controlled independently (or autonomously) or dependently through device users [43].

LLM judge: YES

## (s33) •
(p33.0) Real time: refers to the immediate data processing to provide instant results for a time-sensitive application. • Near real time: refers to situations when the delay time is still relevant for the application, but the computation process is not as immediate as real time. • Batch-processing: refers to situations when data are first collected and processed at a predetermined interval or when a specified volume of data is available [37].

LLM judge: YES

## (s34) Mode
(p34.0) The combination of sensors serving different purposes and data generated in IoE applications implies the need to classify data sources and information in the IoT context [72]. During real-time data harvesting, it can be challenging to determine the possible relationships among heterogeneous knowledge sources [69]. Smart device sensors are either active or passive sensors, depending on their usage and functionalities. If the sensor data collected are reflected in the same way as designed, this is called active functionality. However, sensors operate passively when collected data are interpreted or processed in new ways [17,65].

LLM judge: YES

## (s35) •
(p35.0) Reciprocal interdependence: The highest interdependence level, in which one collaborator's contributions are the next collaborator's inputs, and collaborators must also negotiate the nature of each other's contributions to the collaboration environment.

(p35.1) The Mode dimension refers to the way of linking the physical and digital world in order to acquire context [127], and it can be either sensed, derived, or manually provided:

LLM judge: YES

## (s38) Processing
(p38.0) The sensors and devices used for data collection also vary in their processing capabilities [130]. The study of Mon et al. [127] classifies sensors as high-end or low-end devices, depending on resources and computational capabilities. Low-end devices are resource-constrained with regard to energy, processing power, and communication capacities. The processing capability refers to the sensors' ability to process aggregated data locally [55].

LLM judge: YES

## (s40) Discussion and Comparison with Previous Work
(p40.0) In this section, we discuss theoretical and practical implications and limitations. We present a brief comparison of the scope of the proposed IoE taxonomy and 76 IoE and IoT taxonomy previous works selected in the literature review (presented in Section 3). We examined their diverse approaches in order to enhance understanding of the contextual aspects of IoE/IoT addressed and their relationships in identifying knowledge in IoE/IoT applications. Table 2 shows the adherence of the analyzed studies to our proposed IoE taxonomy across the proposed categories and dimensions. In relation to dimensions of the IoE taxonomy, capabilities is the category most frequently addressed and studied, followed by observation and type of sensor, respectively. The summaries show that most taxonomies support at least two dimensions, but knowledge support is limited.

(p40.1) The proposed IoE taxonomy (in bold) covered all (100%) of the 18 dimensions. It should be noted that, on average, the remaining 76 studies covered 25,5% of the dimensions. The framework proposed by Boyes and Hallaq [113] obtained the second-highest coverage (72,2%), with 13 dimensions; however, it did not include aspects related to the type of knowledge in IoE applications. On average, the knowledge category obtained 24,7% coverage, while the type of sensor, observation, and capabilities categories appeared in 20.5, 20, and 44.3% of the studies, respectively.

(p40.2) The results indicated a lack of interest (only 15.8%) in identifying knowledge sources in terms of explicitness (tacit, explicit, or implicit). Moreover, only 13.1% of the studies addressed how the outcome of the IoE application was achieved and benefited by complementation (accompaniment) or substitution (replacement) of knowledge in IoE processes (between things, data, and humans). Thus, further research should consider this gap and attempt to examine the impact of knowledge identification on the design of IoE applications and how knowledge should be synthesized and combined to drive knowledge creation and intelligent services that create value. In conclusion, the findings of this present study provided an insight into the current trend of IoE research. 

LLM judge: YES

## (s41) Results
(p41.0) This section presents the application of the proposed taxonomy in diverse IoE domains. We intended to validate the IoE taxonomy's practical applicability for classifying knowledge in the IoE applications in relation to the following proposed categories: knowledge, type, observation, and capabilities. We conducted conceptual and pragmatical validations aimed to show that the proposed taxonomy involves the qualitative attributes of robustness and comprehensiveness. It contains enough dimensions and characteristics to clearly differentiate the objects of interest into distinct domains and to classify all known objects within the field under consideration [88].

LLM judge: YES

## (s53) Example of Classification of One Application with the Proposed Taxonomy
(p53.0) Other sensors like video cameras process video streams locally to provide the analysis of product availability on the shelves. The information is confirmed by other sensors (light sensors, infra-red, and RFID sensors), and the data and metadata are sent to the cloud to be processed. Other relevant information, such as weather data, local events and commemorative dates, and promotion details, are analyzed and combined with the current on-shelf availability of products to provide demand forecasting and model buyer behavior [114]. In the cloud servers, real-time data are processed and combined with models from learning systems, data obtained from enterprise Point of Sale systems, and inventory systems to recommend action plans to maintain the on-shelf availability of products. The store staff is informed, and action is taken to restock products and rectify business processes for quality improvement. While shopping, customers can take their pets to the pet store for bathing and grooming, and they can use their mobile devices to monitor their pets via a sensor on the animal's collar.

(p53.1) The classification of the on-shelf availability application using the proposed IoE taxonomy highlighted the interdependencies between knowledge characteristics, sensors, and observations, considering the capabilities of available resources and expected outcomes for a new buying experience, such as insights for customers and business process improvement for suppliers.

(p53.2) With these elements, we defined a common vocabulary that can uncover existing and forthcoming application characteristics. The taxonomy has the quality attribute of being concise and having a limited number of dimensions, restricted to what is relevant and understandable. Moreover, it is explanatory enough to provide useful explanations and valuable descriptions of the nature of the exemplified application selected.
