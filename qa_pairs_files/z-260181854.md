## (s9) Indications for cochlear implantation in children:
(p9.0) -bilateral sensorineural hearing loss >80 dB HL determined based on hearing tests after approximately 6 months of rehabilitation with the use of hearing aids   9 . Abnormal anatomy of the inner ear is a common cause of congenital deafness; therefore, imaging is extremely important in such cases 9 . The visualization of inner ear structures requires special section planes and sequences so that for example all 4 nerves may be determined in the internal auditory meatus (acoustic, facial, superior vestibular and, inferior vestibular nerve) 9 . CT scan and it`s modification as a Cone
## (s14) Complications:
(p14.0) Every surgical procedure relates to complications, generally after CIs implantation are rare, even when taking short-term and long-term events into account. Depending on the definition, rates of between 5.7% and 12.8% are reported 33,34 . The most common of them are: implant defects (1.9-3.4%), dizziness (2.2-3.9%), and wound infections (1.9%). Severe perioperative complications in the form of facial paralysis are put at 0.1-0.6% of cases, and at below 0.1% for meningitis 21,33,34 .
## (s15) Research and future development:
(p15.0) Over the past 2 decades, there has been a huge development in the field of hearing implants and as outlined above, most people with a hearing prosthesis have a good level of communication, but the results vary greatly. the ability to transmit information at the electrode-nerve interface is of fundamental importance, which is determined by the functional state of the auditory nerve and the number of effective electrode channels, as well as by central auditory processing of the basic input signal by the existing cognitive system 5  -Speech processing strategy -With a significant improvement in the electrode-nerve interface with more electrically separate channels, other speech processing strategies can be used to increase the amount of information transmitted, spectral contrasting and simulate the physiological patterns of auditory nerve excitation 5 .
