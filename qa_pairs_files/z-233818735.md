## (s1) Benefit from β-glucans in cancer patients
(p1.0) As we know, the immune system is classified into adaptive and innate [28]. The first is represented by a rapid line of defense against pathogens while the adaptive system develops a long-lasting response that protects the organism from subsequent encounters with the same pathogen and therefore plays a fundamental role in the protection against infections and in the efficacy of vaccines [29][30][31]. One of the mechanisms that stimulate the induction of trained immunity is epigenetic reprogramming: after stimulation with certain ligands such as β-glucan or Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the immune cells undergo a functional reprogramming which involves an increase of their reactivity to the next stimulation [32]. The control and surveillance of tumors involves an intricate dance between the adaptive and innate immune system.

(p1.1) It has been demonstrated that the association of β-glucans with chemotherapy is able to enhance cytotoxicity and can improve patient clinical outcome. The use of medical mushroom extracts has been studied in association with chemotherapy in different kinds of cancers, such as estrogen receptor negative human breast cancer, gastric and colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hematologic diseases [33][34][35][36].

(p1.2) The advent of immunotherapy has dramatically changed cancer treatment. In particular, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has had great success in the treatment of numerous types of malignancies and their use in clinical practice is progressively increasing. The response to immunotherapy is variable often due to a different involvement of the tumor microenvironment (TME). To modify TME with increasing the presentation of antigens by the tumor mass and thus stimulating the response of the immune cells towards the tumor cells is, currently, under investigation [27].

(p1.3) In this regard, β-glucan molecules are a potential immune-modulator that acts on the innate and adaptive immune response within TME. Β-glucan could have an adjuvant role in stimulating and improve clinical response to ICIs [37].
## (s2) Molecular composition and modulation of immune cells
(p2.0) β-glucans are polysaccharides composed of D-glucose monomers linked together by 1→3 linear β-glycosidic bonds. The glycosidic chain core has 1→6 side branches that are specific of fungi-derived glucans [38]. In some subgroups of fungi, the polysaccharide chain may also be bound with protein or peptides, by forming PSK or PCP complexes [39].

(p2.1) β-glucans has been deeply studied as biological response modifiers (BRMs) [40]: they interact directly with receptors located on plasmatic membrane of immune cells and are able to elicit an effective inflammatory and immune response against non-self antigens expressed by pathogens but also on tumor cells [41].

(p2.2) The immune-modulatory properties of β-D-glucans have been widely investigated and it has been supposed that they exert an antitumor activity, by enhancing immune system against tumor cells and by inhibiting tumor invasion and progression through a complex modulation of mechanisms of apoptosis and angiogenesis [42].

(p2.3) Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that β-D-glucans are able to modulate the responsiveness and the interaction between innate and adaptive immune systems [43] (Figure 1). They can enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils, leading to maturation of these target cells and to an increased proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine release. This reflects in a stimulation of adaptive immune cells, including CD4 + T cells, CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and B cells. Specifically, the tumoricidal mechanisms carried out by T cells and induced by β-glucans can be summarized in this way. The β-glucan binds specific receptors (for example, Dectin-1 which will be discussed below) expressed on myeloid cells, which are converted into antigen presenting cells (APCs). The binding activates the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells which in turn will produce pro-inflammatory cytokines [respectively tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, anti-tumor cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Granzyme B, and perforins], leading to the destruction of cancer cells [44]. Similarly β-glucan induces switching of suppressive M2 macrophages into inflammatory M1 macrophages which in turn will activate Th1-type T cells, causing damage to cancer cells through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by T cells [45]. On the other hand, the link between β-glucan and polymorphonuclear cell will cause cell apoptosis with the release of ROS in the microenvironment leading to the death of tumor cells from oxidative stress [46]. Besides, β-D-glucans are also modulators of NK cells cytotoxicity. These compounds are able to stimulate activation of NK cells against tumor cells, both by production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and by complement activation [47]. In this context, it has been shown that β-glucans can induce granulopoietic progenitors and, in general, innate immune cells towards a tumor-suppressive phenotype [48].
## (s3) Receptors of β-glucan
(p3.0) The interaction between β-glucans and their receptors on human cells is likely to be very complex and only partially known. The main receptors that are involved in inflammatory and immune-response are Dectin-1, CR3, LacCer, NKp30 and scavenger receptors [9].
## (s4) Dectin-1
(p4.0) Dectin-1 is a type II transmembrane pattern-recognition receptor with an extracellular C-type lectin-like domain fold and a cytoplasmic domain that contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) [10,49]. After binding of β-glucans, it can mediate the non-opsonic phagocytosis of opportunistic pathogens and it is responsible of cytokine release [50]. In fact, Dectin-1 induces phosphorylation of its ITAM and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and activates an intracellular PI3K/Akt pathway. Thus, the result is an increased production and release of various inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, CXC-chemokine ligand 2 (CXCCL2), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10 and IL-12. Dectin-1 can also collaborates with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on the same cell, in order to enhance cytokine production, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-23, and down-regulate release of IL-12 [51].

(p4.1) Furthermore, Dectin-1 associated intracellular signaling also involves cytoplasmic Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which activation seems to be essential for IL-1b production and secretion [52]. In human cells, Dectin-1 has another binding site that can recognize an endogenous ligand on T cells: in this sense, Dectin-1 has been proposed to act as a T cell co-stimulatory molecule [53]. CR3, also known as macrophage 1 antigen (Mac-1), belongs to the family of β2 integrins and is an heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of two non-covalently associated chains (CD18 and CD11b), found on immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and NK cells [54]. Its lectin-like domain is responsible for binding to β-glucans and this binding primes leukocytes for cytotoxicity and phagocytosis of target cells, through a Syk-PI3K molecular pathway. In fact, CR3 has a second ligand able to recognize iC3b-coated tumor cells and its activation for complement-dependent cytotoxicity and then tumor cell lysis requires its dual binding to iC3b and β-glucan [55,56].
## (s5) LacCer
(p5.0) LacCer is the most abundant neutral glycosphingolipid and it is expressed on various human cells, among these on neutrophils. LacCer forms lipid rafts on plasmatic membrane of neutrophils and, after binding with β-glucans, it activates a signal transduction pathway involving Src family kinase/PI3K. The result is neutrophil chemotaxis [57,58] and enhanced cytokine release [59,60]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CR3 and LacCer was partially co-localized on lipid rafts of plasma membrane of neutrophils and some preclinical data suggest that LacCer-mediated phagocytosis may be dependent on CR3, suggesting a co-stimulatory activity of these two β-glucans receptors [61].
## (s6) NKp30
(p6.0) NKp30 belongs to immunoglobulin-like transmembrane receptor family and it was needed to bind 1-3 β-glucan by NK cells. It has been demonstrated that this receptor can activate Src family kinases and mediate granule polarization and perforin release in NK cells. In this sense, NKp30 has been recognized as a patternrecognition receptor, whose stimulation enhances NK cell killing of fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans [62].
## (s7) Scavenger receptors
(p7.0) It has been demonstrated that fungal β-glucans can also bind to other membrane receptors, such as scavenger receptors. β-glucans can interact with the CD5 ectodomain, present on plasmatic membranes of T and B cells and can induce mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and cytokine release [63].
## (s8) Preclinical studies
(p8.0) Several β-glucans extracted from different species of fungi have been investigated as BRMs and the most relevant ones are described in Table 1. We focused on BTH-1677 (Imprime-PGG) because it is one of the most studied β-glucans in combination with ICIs.

(p8.1) BTH-1677 is a water-soluble and intravenous formulation of yeast-derived β-glucan purified from the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is recognized as a fungal pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and it is able to trigger a complex and coordinated immune response that involves both innate and adaptive immune cells. Its mechanisms of action as immune-modulator and anti-tumoral agent has been deeply investigated in preclinical and clinical studies.

(p8.2) Bose et al. [78] demonstrated that BTH-1677 interacts with human-isolated neutrophils and monocytes through a CR3 and complement-dependent manner. This result has been also confirmed in a mice model [79].
