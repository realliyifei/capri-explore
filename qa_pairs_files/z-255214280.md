## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Maternal behavior in most mammalian species has been defined as the pattern of behaviors exhibited by the mother that contribute to ensuring survival and health of the for the calf which is part of the 'Hider/Follower' paradigm described in wild ungulates by other authors [22,24,25]. While most cows deliver the fetus in lateral recumbency, they become increasingly restless as calving approaches, spending a majority of the preceding three hours in a standing position [26]. The time spent standing could be either attributable to vigilance against predators or pain and anxiety associated with the onset of uterine contractions in Stage 1 of labor [27]. In summary, the goal of these behaviors around the time of calving by the cow is to ensure both successful physical delivery of the fetus as well as ensuring an optimal environment for the onset of postpartum maternal behaviors. This is achieved by firstly locating an appropriate birth site with low risk of predation, disturbance, and offspring mistaken identity [22]. Successful completion of the described prepartum behaviors ensures postpartum success and potentiates offspring survival [22].
## (s1) Postpartum Behavior
(p1.0) Cows bond almost immediately with their calves in the postpartum period and this is believed to be triggered by both the amniotic fluid from within the fetal membranes and hormonal changes within the dam herself [19,28]. Immediately after calving, the cow will devote the majority of her time licking and sniffing the calf, possibly to stimulate calf activity, facilitate drying from maternal uterine fluids to reduce heat loss, as well as socially bonding with the calf [29]. The licking behavior of cows is also believed to stimulate urination and defaecation by the calf, and the mother does this by repeatedly licking the anogenital region of the calf [30]. Figure 1 shows a Brahman cow licking her calf whilst also directing toward her udder. Licking and sniffing behaviors are a well-recognized component of the formation of the cow-calf bond which is crucial to ensuring ongoing survival, health and performance of the calf up until weaning [3]. Intensity of licking behavior peaks in the first hour after calving and then declines thereafter [25]. Interestingly, in Friesian dairy cattle, multiparous cows have been observed to exhibit higher intensities of licking during the first hour post-calving compared to first-calf heifers, whereas heifers were observed to exhibit a higher licking intensity in the second hour compared to multiparous cows [29]. This suggests that inexperienced mothers may take longer to initiate interactions with her calf.

This suggests that inexperienced mothers may take longer to initiate interactions with her calf. Nonetheless, there is agreement within the literature that this maternal bond is established and cemented by cow-calf pairs very early following parturition. This theory was supported by [31], in which two experiments were conducted with the aim of understanding the development of the early relationship between the cow and calf. In the first experiment, calves were left with their own mothers for either 24 or 96 h after birth. After only 24 h of interaction, it was found that each cow could discriminate between her calf and similar alien calves, however if cows were taken away at 24-96 h and re-joined with a different calf three days later, cows were unable to make a distinction between their own calves and alien calves suggesting three days separation is enough to break down the maternal bond [31]. The second experiment compared cow behaviors on subsequent calf re-introduction for those who either had their calf removed immediately or were allowed early calf contact for several hours. The cows that had calves removed immediately exhibited significantly lower interest in their own (or alien) calves on reintroduction, compared to those who had interaction time. In summary, the cow must develop a bond with her calf immediately postpartum to develop recognition and be able to discriminate alien calves [31]. These calf separation experiments have also been performed by other authors, and show similar findings [32]. Behaviors such as close contact, licking and suckling are crucial to this bond development [26]. Remote monitoring devices such as proximity loggers and pedometers may be able to objectively assess trends in cow-calf contact and suckling bouts, however recording the nature of early contact behavior may still entail a degree of subjectivity.
## (s4) Contacts and Behavior in the Postpartum Period
(p4.0) To facilitate the aforementioned crucial cow-calf bonding behaviors of licking, nurturing and suckling, close contact between the cow and her calf must occur. Close contacts between cows and calves immediately after birth is essential to the formation of the maternal bond and calf survival [37]. This is reiterated as animal contact is a measurable Vet. Sci. 2023, 10, 10 5 of 25 trait that can be recorded by remote monitoring devices in extensive environments and potentially holds promise for achieving objectivity in behavioral assessment [38]. Intensive and intimate contact in the sensitive period immediately after calving is firstly facilitated by selection of an undisturbed calving environment by the mother [22]. For cows who isolate themselves from the herd for calving, the cow-calf pair will then re-join the herd within days which highlights that these ungulates portray both 'hider' and 'follower' type behavioral tendencies in herd settings [22]. Proximity between the cow and calf is initially maintained by the mother for the first few hours of life, and this distance starts to increase after several hours as the cow begins to recommence grazing following parturition [29]. As the calf becomes more agile and gains mobility, this distance then reduces, suggesting that both the cow and the calf have a role in maintaining proximity [39]. Using contact logging devices, it was also found that cows exhibited significantly higher contacts and longer duration of contacts with their own calves compared to the rest of the herd from calving until weaning [40]. This close contact is firstly facilitated by the cow, and then maintained by both cow and calf until weaning when the duration and frequency of interactions then gradually reduce over time [9]. The proximity between cow and calf is essential to not only allow feeding but also in maintaining social interactions, grooming, resting and predation prevention, allowing the social bond to develop further [39,40]. This close proximity during early life has also been shown to be important for subsequent maternal behavior of that offspring [20,32]. This may further suggest inter-and transgenerational effects of early contact and maternal behavior.

(p4.1) Another characterized aspect of bovine maternal behavior is the formation of what is known as a 'crèche' whereby a number of offspring are watched over and protected by a single cow, whether the calves are her own or another cow's offspring [41]. Anecdotal reports also exist from observations in extensive production systems in Australia whereby individual cows will form these 'crèches' whereby a single or secondary cow may oversee a group of calves for other mothers, suggesting a cooperative role in mothering in the postpartum period [42]. Whilst the role of these 'crèches' (Figure 3) is not completely understood, it could identify mothers that may contribute to the holistic well-being and production of the herd by allowing other herdmates to graze whilst the calves are monitored and protected from predation by that said individual [42].  In summary, close proximity in the immediate postpartum period is important not only to facilitate nursing, nutrient supply, and predation protection which are critical to the health of the calf, but also for social and behavioral reasons, which may have transgenerational effects. Consequently, a number of studies have attempted to investigate these behaviors either via direct observation or via remote monitoring devices (Table 1).

## (s11) Influence of Genetics on Maternal Behavior
(p11.0) Maternal behavior in cattle has been reported to be at least, in part, genetically controlled [3]. More broadly, in a review of the molecular and genetic bases of maternal behavior in mammals by [84], it has been suggested that the learned maternal behavior of the mother from her early experiences are indirectly related, and potentially moderated by the mothers' own genetic profile and epigenetic mechanisms. Whilst this review mainly focused on laboratory animals like rats, it provides a unique insight into some of the more intricate factors influencing mothering ability that are yet to be studied in livestock. This review surmised that host genetics is associated with behavior via three key hormonal pathways involving oxytocin, dopamine and 5 HT (serotonin) [84]. The underlying genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to some of these psychoneurobiological mechanisms associated with behavior were explored at length. Whilst this review focused mostly on humans and rats, it was concluded that the mother's innate genetic profile moderates how behavior is expressed, and it is likely that this could be similarly reflected in livestock. This review also highlighted other relevant insights in humans which demonstrate a genetic link to maternal behavior through the action of hormones such as oxytocin. In a human study individuals had blood sampled for oxytocin and a mouthwash for salivary DNA, as well having interactions between parent and infant observed [85]. Of the individuals who were genotyped for the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and CD38 (an ectoenzyme that mediates the release of oxytocin from the brain) risk alleles, both the levels of plasma oxytocin levels and parental interaction were lower. This suggests a possible link between certain gene pathways, hormone levels, particularly oxytocin, and maternal behavior. Similar studies have also investigated this genetic-hormonal pathway with prolactin. Pup-directed maternal behavior has been studied using mice typed for the Prolactin Receptor (PRLR) mutation gene. Using mice that were either pregnant or exposed to pups, behavioral observations based on pup retrieval and crouching were made, and it was found that both homozygous and heterozygous PRLR mutant females showed a deficiency in maternal behavior and care [140]. Given the promising findings in lab animals, the concept was further explored in sheep [86]. Prolactin Receptor (PRLR) mRNA was extracted from the pituitary region of slaughtered ewes and analyzed by qPCR. Prior to euthanasia, four main maternal behaviors were observed including lamb grooming, acceptance and suckling (normal maternal behavior); as well as aggression and suckling rejection (abnormal maternal behavior). The expression of higher PRLR mRNA was found in the ewe group with 'normal maternal behavior' [86]. The action and effectiveness of prolactin is unsurprisingly mediated via its hormone receptor (PRLR) in the brain, and therefore work of this kind provides unique insight into receptor characteristics of certain hormones that could be carried across generations. Inferences from other species provide insight into the transgenerational links associated with maternal behaviour. It has been suggested that transgenerational programming of maternal behavior could be triggered by exposure to certain stressors prenatally in lab rats [141]. This was explored through experimentation. Rats were exposed to daily stress treatments of a restraint container and swim stress throughout the latter half of gestation [141]. The impact of stress treatments was measured using observations of 'tail chasing' behavior. The mothers exposed to effective stressors, passed on behavioral responses to her offspring and this impacted mothering ability across generations. These findings were also consistent with a previous study by [142] who found that rats exposed to stressors during gestation altered postpartum maternal care behaviors in the offspring. This would suggest that the intergenerational effects are slightly more complex than being attributed to things such as single hormone or experience, and nonetheless warrant further investigation. There are no known studies that have been published on the transgenerational hormonal effects in livestock, and more specifically, these models are also yet to be characterized in cattle.
## (s12) Calf Factors
(p12.0) Calf factors are also related to differences in the expression of maternal behavior in cattle. Some of the these calf factors include sex and weight [2]. Calf weaning weight was also found to be associated with cow-calf proximity in a behavioral observation study which followed 10 bull calves and 10 heifer calves until weaning. It was found that cows and calves spent more time together when the calf was a female (compared to male), and more time spent with calves which had a lower weaning weight, which seems somewhat counterintuitive [25]. However, some disagreements were found by others, for instance when observing cows from day three to 30 into lactation, it was found that male calves received both more maternal protection and more frequent nursing compared to females [80]. The increased interaction with male calves was also found using Zebu Bos indicus animals as a comparison, and they found that the increased frequency of interaction between cows and male calves was also independent to the sex of their own calf [147]. Cows in better body condition have also been shown to provide more intense protection of their young, supported by a clear relationship between cow body condition and calf weight gain and nursing [80]. In general, the relationships between calf weight, weaning weight and cow body condition seem plausible, although the direct correlation of these factors with maternal behavior is likely more complex and multifactorial.
## (s15) Conclusions
(p15.0) Bovine maternal behavior is a complex phenotype that can be difficult to measure and predict objectively. The effect of age, breed, parity and husbandry practices on behavior has been reported in the literature at length and is known to vary significantly according to these factors. Despite previous attempts, at present, no known heritable and repeatable biomarkers for superior maternal behavior exist in the cow [2]. Whether this is attributable to inaccuracies in current hormone assays or unreliable estimates of good maternal instinct requires further investigation. Additionally, maternal over-vigilance or aggression could indeed prove counter-productive in certain instances, and calf performance may indeed be a more suitable means to assess the superior rearing of a calf by a cow. A significant challenge, particularly in extensive beef production systems, is associated with objectively and quantitatively assessing maternal behavior. Previous studies have validated the use of contact-based telemetry and/or activity metres to remotely assess behavioral traits in extensive production settings and this may hold promise for future research. The use of maternal behavior scores in response to calf handling have been used in observational studies and compared to calf production traits such as average daily gain and weaning weights. However, past studies have reported mixed findings associated with the heritability and repeatability of observational scoring when trying to establish a link between selectable traits across generations. Work in other species, namely small mammals and rodents, has shown promising links between hormones like prolactin and maternal behavior. Further exploration into the endogenous levels of hormones around calving in cows and maternal behavior could provide valuable insights. A key challenge going forward for the livestock industry will be to find an accurate biomarker that is easily measurable and predictable across generations. Endocrinological profiling may hold promise in future for this purpose, and further research is indeed indicated. Previous work which explores the interplay between genetics, hormonal physiology and maternal behavior provides crucial insights into being able to find these links, and further research is needed in cattle. Ultimately, the complexities in measuring behavioral traits in livestock, as well as the innate variation in hormone levels between individual animals may account for the lack of success when looking to establish a heritable, repeatable, and low-cost assay that may be used to identify superior mothers in the bovine species.
