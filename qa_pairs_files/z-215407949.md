## (s48) Automotive
(p48.0) Another sector that has been applying composites to its products is the automotive one; they use FEM for the bodies of the cars and engines, mainly for impact tests. According to Jung [296] they predict damage under impact loads on automotive components, as impacts can reduce the structural integrity of composite components. Impact damage induces a variety of failure modes: matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. Among these failure modes, delamination is the most significant because the interlaminar mechanical properties are much weaker than those the rest of the composite, and it is difficult to visually detect this damage from the outside [296][297][298].

(p48.1) One of the applications of FEM in this scenario is to understand the behavior of the material during an impact, as in the work developed by Chiacchiarelli, Cerrutti and Flores-Johnson [299], in which they used layers with the same density but different compressive strengths in the direction of load, in a multilayered, rigid polyurethane foam block subjected to impact, since, by its excellent energy absorption capacity, it can be used as a high-level coating resistant to collisions, which makes it attractive for the automotive sector.

(p48.2) In the area of super-sport and competition cars, such as those for Formula One racing, it is very advantageous to use simulations to find the best geometry of a car, since a few seconds can define the winner ( Figure 41) [253,282,287,300-302].

## (s57) Civil Construction
(p57.0) In civil construction, FEM has been used over the years for the structural calculations of buildings, bridges loads, etc., both of brickwork and wood ( Figure 44). For designers, the advance of FEM in composites has helped to elaborate hybrid constructions, wherein fiber-reinforced polymeric composites are used as reinforcements, for example, of bridges and columns, besides helping analyze the effects of natural events such as earthquakes, tornados and hurricanes on builds [142,[318][319][320][321]. In addition, as in the aerospace sector, the new nanostructured composites have been helping to reduce the structural weights of the constructions [277,322].
