## (s1) Radiation therapy
(p1.0) Radiation therapy (RT) has been the mainstay in the management of CNS metastases. Since the presentation is often multi-focal, surgery is not indicated [4]. However, responses of tumor metastases to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) (the current standard of care) are usually incomplete and of short duration and often accompanied by local toxicities, such as neurocognitive loss, etc. [4]. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was the treatment of choice in the past [6]. WBRT was usually started with a warm up dose of 50 cGy on the first treatment day increasing gradually to 200 cGy over several daily fractions to a planned total dose of 3000-4000 cGy [6].

(p1.1) The advent of glucocorticoid steroids controlled the radiation side effects such as headaches, papilledema, etc. and allowed higher daily doses of radiation to be given without exacerbation of intracranial edema, etc. [7,8]. Although palliative care was provided, neurocognitive and other neurological/behavioral disorders still existed [9]. Also, the doses of WBRT administered were insufficient to treat subclinical metastatic disease that is not seen on the imaging tools available. The common dose schedules used were 3000 cGy in 10 fractions or 4000 cGy in 16 fractions [6].
## (s2) Radiosurgical devices
(p2.0) With the development of radiosurgical instruments such as the Gamma Knife and Cyber Knife, it is possible to radiate individual metastatic lesions with great accuracy. In combination with MRI techniques, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become the most widely used procedure to reduce metastatic CNS cancer lesions and has also reduced the incidence of radiation-associated neurocognitive effects [9][10][11][12][13]. The exact radiation dosing varies depending on the size and number of metastases [13,14]. As these techniques have improved, combining WBRT with SRS has been evaluated, and after multiple studies, no increase in overall survival (OS) (but an increase in local control) with WBRT after surgery/radiosurgery has been observed [15][16][17][18]. However, there still remains scenarios in which WBRT may be beneficial. Later in the chapter, we will review this evidence for the use of WBRT.
## (s4) History and rationale
(p4.0) The recognition that certain cancer cell types have a propensity to spread to the central nervous system created interest in adjuvant or prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for some malignancies at lower therapeutic doses [7,18,19].
## (s5) Childhood leukemia: PCI
(p5.0) In children with acute leukemia, it was recognized that the CNS is a sanctuary site for malignant cells and PCI became the standard therapy for many years [19][20][21][22]. However, because of the neurocognitive/behavioral defects and the decrease in IQs that were noted in children who received PCI for childhood leukemia, other treatment methodologies were compared with and without radiation [20]. In 2003, a meta-analysis of 43 randomized trials concluded that radiotherapy can be replaced by long-term intrathecal therapy and a 2009 prospective randomized trial confirmed with 501 subjects confirmed that radiation can be omitted from treatment [21,22]. As such, PCI in the setting of leukemia is not routinely used in clinical practice.
## (s7) The first meta-analysis published by Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Overview Collaborative
(p7.0) Group supporting the use of PCI in limited SCLC was published in 1999 and proved that PCI reduced the incidence of brain metastases by 50% with an absolute survival advantage of 5%. This 5% was the same amount of absolute survival advantage seen with thoracic radiation after induction chemotherapy in limited SCLC [25].

(p7.1) Of importance, a high proportion of subjects with SCLC had specific cognitive defects prior to PCI without any significant deterioration following PCI. For extensive SCLC, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Lung Cancer Group showed a slight improvement in survival with the addition of PCI after induction therapy, but in absolute terms, the benefit was minimal after 1 year; survival in the radiated group was 27.1%, as compared with 13.3% in the control group. In the PCI group, two subjects remained alive at 24 months, while in the control (no PCI), all subjects were dead by 18 months [24].

(p7.2) NCCN treatment guidelines continue to recommend PCI for SCLC, even though there have been significant advances in the imaging and treatment of brain metastases. Since many of the original studies advocating the use of PCI were published using CT as the imaging choice for the brain, it is now postulated that many small brain metastases that were missed by CT would have been detected by sensitive MRI [8]. The fact that MRI scanning detects SCLC metastasis 24% of the time, as opposed to 11% with CT, means that there will be fewer patients with undetected cranial metastases after imaging with a contrast-enhanced MRI study, thus possibly reducing the role for WBRT going forward.
