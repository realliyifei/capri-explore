## (s1) Existence and Uniqueness of Fixed Points
(p1.0) The existence and uniqueness of fixed points is a fundamental theme in fixed point theory. It studies the conditions under which a given function possesses fixed points and whether those fixed points are unique. Fixed points are points in a function's domain that remain unchanged after the function's application. The present theme addresses questions central to understanding the stability, equilibrium, and behavior of transformations in various mathematical contexts.

(p1.1) One of the central theorems related to the subject of the existence and uniqueness of fixed points unique is the Banach fixed-point theorem, also known as the contraction mapping principle which establishes the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point for a contraction mapping on a complete metric space. A contraction mapping is a function that contracts distances between points, ensuring convergence to a unique equilibrium point. The result serves as a foundational building block for subsequent theorems and provides a powerful tool for proving the existence and uniqueness of fixed points in various settings.

(p1.2) Another key result in this field is Brouwer's fixed point theorem. The theorem demonstrates that every continuous function defined on a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of Euclidean space has at least one fixed point. It highlights the existence of fixed points within a geometric context and has profound implications in pure and applied mathematics. The combination of compactness, convexity, and continuity ensures the presence of fixed points, showcasing the interplay between geometry and fixed point properties [51,74].
## (s3) 2.2.
(p3.0) Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem. Brouwer's theorem showcases the existence of fixed points in a broader context. It is a fundamental result in topology and fixed point theory. It was first proved by Luitzen E.J. Brouwer in 1911 [22]. It states that every continuous function f from a nonempty, compact, and convex subset D of Euclidean space R n to itself has at least one fixed point. In other words, there is at least one point x in D such that f (x) = x. Theorem 2.2 (Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem). Let D be a nonempty, compact, convex subset of Euclidean space R n , and let f : D → D be a continuous function. Then, f has at least one fixed point in D.

(p3.1) The key to Brouwer's fixed point theorem is the combination of compactness, convexity, and continuity. Compactness ensures that the function f has a limit at every point in D. Convexity ensures that the function f does not "escape" from D. Continuity ensures that the function f does not "jump" around in D.
## (s4) Schauder Fixed Point
(p4.0) Theorem. The Schauder fixed point theorem is a significant result in fixed point theory which bridges compact and non-compact sets. It was first proved by Juliusz Schauder in 1930 [101]. It states that if a continuous function T maps a nonempty, compact, convex subset K of a Banach space X into itself, then T has at least one fixed point in K. Afterwards a number of generalizations of this results have been made. One of the most famous ones was by Tychonoff [118], which is now known as the Schauder-Tychonoff fixedpoint theorem.
## (s6) 3.3.
(p6.0) Borsuk-Ulam Theorem. The Borsuk-Ulam theorem is a fundamental result in algebraic topology and geometry. It was first proved by Karol Borsuk and Stanislaw Ulam in 1924 [18] and it establishes antipodal points with identical function values The theorem shows that for any continuous function f : S n → R n , where S n is the n-dimensional unit sphere, there exist two antipodal points x and −x on the sphere such that f (x) = f (−x).
## (s7) Fixed Point in Simplicial
(p7.0) Complexes. The study of fixed points in simplicial complexes is a branch of mathematics that lies at the intersection of topology and combinatorial mathematics. A simplicial complex is a structure composed of simplices (geometric objects like line segments, triangles, and their higher-dimensional analogs) that are interconnected in a specific way. Investigating fixed points within such complexes involves examining continuous mappings that preserve the structure of the complex, with an emphasis on points that remain unchanged under these mappings.

(p7.1) The Fixed Point Theorem for Simplicial Complexes is a fundamental result in the area of simplicial complexes. It states that for any continuous map defined on a finite simplicial complex, there must be at least one point that remains fixed under the map. In other words, no matter how intricate the simplicial complex is, the existence of at least one point that doesn't move is guaranteed. It demonstrates the structural stability that these complexes possess and adds a layer of understanding to the behavior of continuous functions within such discrete and interconnected spaces. The theorem can be proved by using Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem and an analytic argument based on the idea of simplicial approximation. Essentially, it is an application of the earlier mentioned Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem. After decades of ongoing research in this topic, the theorem is an important tool for various seemingly unrelated areas of research.

(p7.2) In the topics related to topology of manifolds, this theorem plays a central role in formulating several fixed point results (see Raymond's paper [95] for example). In modern research, the theorem, with its origin in the simplicial methods and approximation theorems, has vast implications beyond topology and touch upon a wide array of applications from graph theory to optimization problems [2,3]. These findings demonstrate that even in settings where continuous functions interact with discrete structures, fixed points are an inherent phenomenon [34]. It adds another layer of depth to the exploration of fixed points, emphasizing their ubiquity and providing insights into the relationship between continuous transformations and the underlying geometric and combinatorial structures of simplicial complexes (see Pandey's paper [87] for example).
## (s9) Set-Valued and Nonlinear Operators
(p9.0) Set-valued and nonlinear operators are an exciting branch of fixed point theory that expands the scope of understanding beyond traditional single-valued functions. Research in this field explores mappings that associate sets with points or sets with sets, and it delves into the behavior of complex, multivalued transformations.

(p9.1) One of the central theorems in the field is Kakutani's fixed point theorem, which addresses the existence of fixed points for set-valued mappings that satisfy certain properties. It has broad applications in mathematical economics, game theory, and optimization problems, where solutions are often represented as sets of possible outcomes rather than single values. Set-valued mappings introduce new challenges and complexities in analyzing equilibrium points, making this field an essential extension of traditional fixed point theory.

(p9.2) Nonlinear operators, on the other hand, encompass a wide range of functions that may not satisfy the linearity property. The study of nonlinear operators often involves various mathematical techniques, including functional analysis and variational methods. Nonlinear operators frequently arise in differential equations, optimization problems, and nonlinear systems modeling natural phenomena. One notable theorem in this area is the Boyd-Wong fixed point theorem, which considers set-valued functions with contractive properties and provides conditions for the existence of fixed points. The result, among others, offers valuable insights into the behavior of nonlinear operators and their equilibrium points, paving the way for tackling intricate real-world problems with nonlinear dependencies.

(p9.3) Overall, the study of set-valued and nonlinear operators is a natural extension of fixed point theory, catering to scenarios where functions have multivalued mappings or exhibit nonlinear behaviors. These areas provide essential tools for addressing complex mathematical and real-world challenges, ranging from understanding economic equilibria to solving intricate differential equations. By broadening the scope of fixed point analysis, set-valued and nonlinear operators enrich our understanding of equilibrium states and the behavior of functions in diverse contexts [29].
## (s10) Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem.
(p10.0) Kakutani's fixed point theorem is a fundamental result in fixed point theory that explores the existence of fixed points for set-valued functions, known as correspondences. The theorem, named after the Japanese mathematician Shizuo Kakutani, extends the concept of fixed points beyond single-valued functions to include mappings that assign sets of points to other sets of points [60]. It is a generalization of the Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem. The theorem states that if a correspondence F : X → 2 X , where X is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of Euclidean space R n , is upper semicontinuous and has nonempty and convex values for each x, then there exists at least one point x * ∈ X such that x * ∈ F (x * ).
## (s11) 4.2.
(p11.0) Sion's Minimax Theorem. The theorem was first proved by Alexander M. Sion [109] in the mid-20th century, and explores fixed points in the context of game theory. It states that if there exists a convex, compact set of strategies for each player and a continuous function that assigns a payoff to each combination of strategies, then there exists a pair of strategies (one for each player) that forms a minimax solution.

(p11.1) Theorem 4.2 (Sion's Minimax Theorem). Let K be a convex, compact subset of a topological vector space, and let F : K × K → R be a continuous function such that F (x, ·) is concave for each x ∈ K and F (·, y) is convex for each y ∈ K. Then, there exists a point x ∈ K such that F (x, y) ≤ F (x, x) for all y ∈ K.

(p11.2) Using arguments different from, and arguably simpler than the original Sion's proof of the theorem, Komiya [67] and Kindler [64] independently proved the theorem a few decades after the publication of Sion's work. Extensions of Sion's Theorem were studied by various researchers (for example, see Hartung's paper [53]).

(p11.3) Sion's minimax theorem provides a powerful tool for establishing the existence of solutions that balance opposing objectives, often encountered in competitive scenarios or optimization problems. In other words, the theorem guarantees that there exists a strategy for each player that minimizes their maximum possible loss, given the strategies chosen by their opponents. This point is known as the 'saddle point' or the 'minimax point'.
