## (s3) Resection of the Lesser Omentum for Advanced Gastric Cancer
(p3.0) There remains controversy about whether or not to perform omental resection during radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The Japan gastric Cancer Association have recommended that only patients with gastric cancer with serous infiltration should be treated with omental resection [29]. In 2012, Fujita et al. reported the findings from a randomized controlled trial of the long-term outcome of omentectomy during standard total or distal D2 gastrectomy [30]. There was no significant difference in the 3-year cumulative survival rate between the omental resection group and the non-resection group (85.6% vs. 79.6%; P=0.443) [30]. Subgroup analysis showed that the 3-year cumulative survival rate was 69.8% in the omental resection group, and 50.2% in the non-resection group (P=0.043), and the incidence of abdominal metastasis in patients without omentectomy was significantly higher than that in patients who underwent omentectomy (13.2% vs. 8.7%) [30]. However, JCOG followed this study with a large multicenter randomized controlled trial (JCOG1001) that assessed the long-term benefits of D2 lymph node dissection combined with omental resection in patients with T3-T4 advanced gastric cancer [31]. Compared with the omental preservation group, the operation time and intraoperative blood loss were significantly increased in the omental resection group, and the 3-year survival rates were 83.3% and 86.0%, respectively [31]. The findings from this study indicated that patients with stage T3 or T4 gastric cancer did not benefit from routine omental resection [31]. Yamamura et al. found that if gastric cancer micrometastases involved the omental sac, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), there was also likely to be tumor spread to the abdominal cavity, and omental resection was very unlikely to improve patient survival [32].

(p3.1) Currently, surgeons in Japan usually perform omental resection according to the recommendations from the Japanese guidelines and includes resection of the transverse mesocolon and pancreatic capsule (narrow omental sac resection). The advantage of omental sac resection during radical gastrectomy is the possible prevention of peritoneal dissemination, metastasis, and tumor recurrence. However, omental resection increases the surgical difficulty and the operation time, and there is a risk of damaging mesenteric vessels and the pancreas resulting in bleeding and pancreatic leak. Open gastrectomy also prolongs the operation time and requires the use of a general anesthetic with an increase in surgical and anesthetic complications.
