## (s0) METHODS
(p0.0) This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline recommendations (Moher et al., 2009).The PRISMA 27item checklist and four-phase flow diagram (see below) were used to ensure the integrity and rigor of data extraction and reporting.
## (s20) Emotional
(p20.0) The third student-voiced concern category consists of worry about navigating emotions at school post-hospitalization (Clemens et al., 2010(Clemens et al., , 2011;;Marraccini & Pittleman, 2022;Preyde et al., 2018;Preyde et al., 2021;Weiss et al., 2015).Students with mental health needs already have difficulty regulating their emotions at school prior to hospitalization.Therefore, it is logical that they would be concerned about their personal coping skills amidst their return to school.
## (s22) Hospital Voice
(p22.0) Across six articles, the hospital or treatment team emerged as a key stakeholders' voice.Acute psychiatric hospital staff are in the best position to use their clinical ability to inform transition accommodations and placement considerations.Utilizing the expertise of a multidisciplinary mental health team assists in providing feedback to schools regarding appropriate educational accommodations and settings based on the student's mental health diagnosis (Savina et al., 2014).Once hospital staff support the youth in developing a proactive coping plan, they can share the individualized strategies with school (see Student Voice, Emotional Domain).
## (s27) TRANSITION MEETINGS
(p27.0) Before a youth returns to school, there is a need for a transition meeting with key stakeholders to allow coordination of all parties (see Table 1; n = 18 articles).Where the meeting occurs and who is present varies (Clemens et al., 2011;White et al., 2017).Those present at the meeting (whether in person, phone, or virtually) should include, at minimum, the student, caregiver, school point person, hospital point person, and outpatient therapist (Clemens et al., 2011).
## (s30) Timing
(p30.0) The timing of the transition should be thoughtfully considered.A slower transition into school may be ideal for some students (Clemens et al., 2011;Marraccini et al., 2019;Preyde et al., 2017;Weiss et al., 2015;White et al., 2006;White et al., 2017).The most crucial time to reestablish the student in school is the first few days to the first few weeks post-hospitalization (Simon & Savina, 2010).Therefore, timing of the transition based upon student needs may aid in establishing successful outcomes.
## (s32) Dedicated Programs
(p32.0) Sites with dedicated programs focusing on acute psychiatric hospitalization to school transitions have better outcomes (Marraccini et al., 2019;Weiss et al., 2015;White et al., 2006;White et al., 2017).With regard to the two models described previously, in the School Transition Program, three positive outcomes occurred: greater caregiver satisfaction, decreased length of inpatient stays, and decreased readmission rates (Weiss et al., 2015).Further, central to the BRYT program's successful outcomes of increased rates of school attendance, graduation, and day-to-day functioning are core features of providing dedicated spaces for returning students, flexible transition plans, and significant wrap-around support (White et al., 2017).
## (s33) DISCUSSION
(p33.0) Goals of this literature review were to provide an updated theoretical framework and clinical template to facilitate successful school transitions for youth after acute psychiatric hospitalization.Our results align with and extend those of Savina et al. (2014) and Tougas (2019) by adding critical key elements, a practitioner lens, and a tangible resource.Four critical elements were identified: involving key stakeholders (student/patient, caregiver, psychiatric staff, and school staff) to understand their perspectives; identifying a single point person within the psychiatric staff and school staff; planning and facilitating a transition meeting; and creating formal and informal supports.

(p33.1) Although systematic protocols and PRISMA guidelines were used, some limitations still exist.First, articles were reviewed through the lens of a hospital educator.Thus, the reviewers have direct experience with transitions from acute psychiatric settings to school; yet, "real-world" interpretation bias may still exist despite taking precautions to guard against doing so.Second, literature in this area is scant.We relied on articles that often had small sample sizes or had less rigorous methodologies, which might have limited the robustness of outcomes.Future work should utilize more rigorous research designs.

(p33.2) Regardless of this review's limitations, valuable information can be gleaned.First, outcomes suggest that there is not one specific way to successfully transition youth from an acute psychiatric unit back to their home school.Rather, multiple ways exist involving a combination of many different people, individual characteristics or case-specific nuances, and varied settingspecific supports.This highlights the importance of focusing on the overarching characteristics and key elements of supportive transitions, while allowing flexibility to honor the realities within each specific setting.
## (s35) STAKEHOLDER VOICE
(p35.0) Outcomes show that a supportive and successful transition includes the perspectives of multiple stakeholders.Students, caregivers, school personnel, and hospital personnel are all needed to provide insight on the student's areas of concern, strengths, and educational plan.

(p35.1) It is imperative stakeholders work collaboratively to inform next steps in the transition.Without one of these key stakeholders involved, predicted success of the transition plan will lessen.However, involving whoever is available is a crucial step towards the ideal transition until sound relationships and norms can be established.

(p35.2) Caregivers desire support in navigating the transition process (Clemens et al., 2011;Weiss et al., 2015).It is important that parents understand the importance of the transition and of sharing of information between the hospital and school teams early in their child's hospitalization.

(p35.3) The legal guardian must sign a release of information (Simon & Savina, 2005); schools and/or hospitals should have these forms prepared and ready to discuss with caregivers.Understanding caregivers' concerns about their child's school can assist in identifying areas to target when transition planning.The hospital and school point persons should quickly establish who will lead the process of keeping caregivers informed of updates.

(p35.4) Transition plans should incorporate plans to support the student's academic, social/relational, and emotional concerns.For student academic concerns, for example, having a concrete plan for make-up work during the transition process helps in reducing transition distress (Clemens et al., 2010;Weiss et al., 2015).If social/relational concerns exist, the hospital point person can role-play scenarios with the youth during admission; the school point person, in turn, can set up creative ways to support these interactions post-discharge (Preyde et al., 2017).For emotional concerns, youth should work towards understanding their triggers and identify coping skills.Mental health professionals can assist by establishing a coping skill plan with the youth at discharge and re-entry to help them identify emotions, understand the impact of these emotions, and practice various ways of coping (Clemens et al., 2010;Preyde et al., 2018).

(p35.5) Hospital stakeholder voice may be the most difficult perspective to gain.Many factors may contribute to the absence of the hospital stakeholder, including nonbillable service rendering, limited availability of key medical providers and/or mental health providers, and possible limited knowledge of providers on specific educational implications of psychiatric diagnoses.While these barriers may limit the collaborative nature of the stakeholder team and negatively impact the success of the transition plan, there are alternatives.For example, school personnel can consider including the voice of the student's outpatient mental health therapist or a schoolbased mental health professional to give clinical insight.It may also be helpful to request the patient's discharge summary from the caregiver.
## (s42) Dedicated Programs
(p42.0) Hospitals or schools that have dedicated resources to support transitions back to school postdischarge from acute psychiatric units have improved short-and long-term outcomes (Weiss et al., 2015;White et al., 2006;White et al., 2017).The BRYT (White et al., 2006;White et al., 2017) and School Transition Program (Weiss et al., 2015) are two dedicated acute psychiatric hospitalization to school transition programs that may be replicated.However, as many schools and hospitals are unable to make this type of commitment, research supports that even informal implementations for transitions encourages better outcomes (Marraccini et al., 2019).
