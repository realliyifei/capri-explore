## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Postharvest diseases represent a major problem through the world causing significant losses at postharvest stage [1]. Postharvest treatments play an important role in the quality preservation of commodities; however, in developed countries, the inadequate storage and transportation systems favor the establishment of diverse pathogens [2]. Traditionally, postharvest disease management is carried out by the application of chemical fungicides; however, environmental and health issues as well as microbial resistance play an important role in the development 4. Alternative methods for controlling postharvest diseases 4

## (s11) Antibiosis
(p11.0) Antibiosis is the inhibition of pathogen development by metabolized products and small toxic molecules, volatile and lytic enzymes, which operate structural polymers, such as chitin and β-1-3-glucans of the cell wall in most pathogenic fungi, producing an adverse effect on development and differentiation [55]. Given the above, it is said that the greater the amount of metabolic products, the antagonistic power increases; additionally, some authors mention that this mechanism is not the principle, due to the risk of emergence of the antibiotic-resistant pathogens [55].

## (s12) Secretion of enzymes
(p12.0) The production of enzymes such as chitinase and/or glucanases produced by the fungus of Trichoderma is involved in the control of pathogenic fungi. These hydrolytic enzymes can degrade the cell wall polysaccharides (chitin and β glucans) affecting its stability and integrity [5].

## (s13) Production of inhibitor compounds
(p13.0) The ability to induce resistance in a wide range of diseases caused by various classes of pathogens (including fungi, bacteria, and viruses) in a wide variety of plants may be an important characteristic of Trichoderma [56]. Currently, three classes of compounds are known that are produced by Trichoderma strains and that induce resistance in the plant. These are proteins with enzymatic functions, homologs of proteins encoded for avirulence (Avr), and oligosaccharides.
