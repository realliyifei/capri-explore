## (s7) Frequency of Observational and Experimental Studies in the Literature Search
(p7.0) Most studies identified by our literature search report on observational and correlative approaches based on different types of field surveys (spatial and temporal comparisons) that do not allow for identification of several causal co-varying biotic and abiotic factors, with possible interactive effects (Figure 2a).Establishing causal links between temperature change and biodiversity shifts is challenging, if not impossible, because of the complexity of natural systems, where populations are distributed patchily over heterogeneous environments, subject to a range of environmental conditions and interacting with other species.Two of the main virtues of experimental approaches in ecological research are to reduce the contribution to variation in the response variable of uncontrolled environmental factors (i.e., noise) that may obscure true effects, and identify the underlying driving mechanism (s) [20][21][22].Firm demonstrations that temperature shifts influence performance of individuals, affect the ecological success of populations and species, and that they impact on the functioning of communities and ecosystems would therefore ultimately require experimental manipulations and replication [7,22].About 40% of the reviewed studies fell within this category and report on comparisons between experimentally manipulated temperature treatments, with the remaining 60% of studies relying instead on observational approaches (Figure 2a).
## (s8) Characteristics of Experimental Studies
(p8.0) Of the experimental studies, most (83%) were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions, and only a minority (3%) used a combination of field and laboratory experiments (Figure 2a).To forecast the consequences of climate change, interfacing processes at different scales in space, time, and ecological organization must be taken into consideration [7,23].It is reasonable to hypothesize that a larger fraction of the multifarious pathways and mechanisms by which temperature, and other factors, may affect fitness of individuals, populations and species [14,[24][25][26] are operative under complex natural conditions that encompass a broader array of ecological interactions than in simpler, standardized settings.The effects seen in manipulation studies conducted under semi-natural or laboratory conditions may therefore differ and sometimes be weaker, compared with experiments conducted in the wild [27,28].Despite this, most ecological studies generally use single-species approaches [29].A similar pattern is evident among the studies of biodiversity effects of temperature change; the majority (60%) of investigations studied single species; 18% studied two different species; and in 22% of the investigations, three or more focal species were studied.Investigating how different species are affected by temperature change can provide valuable knowledge.However, the performance of species depends on interactions with other individuals belonging to the same species, as well as on interactions with different species that may represent food, competitors, predators, herbivores, pathogens or parasites.Linkage density of interactions and connectance among species within natural food webs may be immensely more complex than anticipated based on direct observations of pairwise encounters [30,31].Effects of climate change that may be mediated by species interactions, changes in community composition, cascading effects and ecosystem processes [14,26,29] have therefore likely gone undetected in the majority of the experiments.
## (s9) Response Variables Investigated
(p9.0) The consequences of climate change and associated temperature shifts for species and populations are simple in principle: they can respond by range shifts; adaptation via evolutionary (genetically based) change or phenotypic plasticity; or become extinct.These responses may in turn impact higher level processes, community composition, and ecosystem functioning.A minority (30%) of the studies reviewed here specifically addressed one of the three ultimate species-level consequences of climate change, viz.range shifts, whereas no study addressed extinction or adaptation (Figure 2b).Approximately one fifth (22%) of studies investigated reproductive life-history traits or individual survival which can ultimately influence extinction risk, and one tenth (8%) concerned range shifts (Figure 2b).None of the studies reviewed here provided evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change-as discussed in greater detail elsewhere [15].
## (s19) Use Multi-Species Approaches
(p19.0) Only one fifth of the studies included in this review included three or more focal species.Even single-species studies can provide important contributions for the understanding of climate change impacts on biodiversity, and help disentangle results from more complex experiments and settings.However, the performance and ecological success of individuals, species and communities is defined by interactions of the abiotic environment and by complex interactions between individuals belonging to the same or to different species.Rosenblatt and Schmitz [34] synthesized literature on the interactive effects of multiple climate change variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation, CO 2 , O 3 , ultraviolet radiation) on trophic interactions.They report that the qualitative effect on response variables directly related to trophic interactions (such as feeding rate, weight gain, and population biomass) depend on whether climate change variables were manipulated alone or together.Furthermore, both response type and magnitude are highly context dependent, indicating that unanticipated emergent effects of climate change on ecosystems are likely to occur [34].As suggested elsewhere [18], eco-evolutionary dynamics and the roles of direct and indirect multi-species interactions can be studied from an evolving meta-community perspective to obtain deeper insights into the complex issue of how abiotic factors and species interactions together and in an interdependent manner shape biodiversity responses to climate change [10,14,18,26,29].

(p19.1) Theoretical development has progressed faster than the accumulation of empirical tests of interactive responses to climate change [18].In the wait of more experiments within the co-evolving species interaction framework, there is room also for researchers and groups not primarily interested in community ecology to improve the situation, maximize resources, enhance research capacity and generate added value.For instance, it is conceivable that a manipulation experiment originally designed by ecologists working on fish for studying how temperature influences hatching success of eggs, survival of larvae and growth of fry with only minor modifications to study design and sampling scheme can generate valuable information also on bacteria, zooplankton or phytoplankton.
## (s23) Ecologists and Evolutionary Biologists Must Rise to the Challenge
(p23.0) The directions for future research outlined above, and other improvements to study design [7,52], together with the integration of information obtained from different systems and approaches [6], should yield a clearer, more realistic view, and strengthen the validity of future investigations into biodiversity and ecosystem responses to increased overall water temperatures associated with climate change.Compared with investigations into ecological responses, evolutionary biologists are faced with even greater challenges.There is little doubt that climate change will result in marked and widespread changes in selection pressures.However, it remains uncertain whether evolutionary responses can in general be sufficiently rapid to allow for genetically based adaptations to keep pace with the expected rates of environmental changes and shifting selection pressures brought about by climate change [53].Predictions are complicated also because global warming can influence population sizes, patterns of gene flow, and the potential for hybridization-all of which might influence evolution.Clarifying the role of evolution is challenging also because it is difficult to separate genetic adaptations from non-genetic plasticity.Benefits from developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility for population persistence in the face of environmental change can be large [35,54], and plasticity and flexibility are relatively easy to detect compared with genetic changes [15].While plasticity has potential to boost evolutionary adaptations, it can also reduce the evolutionary response to natural selection and thereby prevent genetic adaptation.Empirical studies of the relative roles of plasticity and evolutionary responses within the context of climate change are in high demand but challenging to perform [53].Even less is known about how adaptations and evolutionary changes at the species level brought about by climate change will impact species interactions, community composition and ecosystem functioning.Global warming and its consequences are a major concern for us all.It is crucial that resources and facilities are obtained for tackling also more ambitious research goals, and meeting the demands for large-scale, long-term studies and experiments with greater realism.The future we are about to enter will likely be warmer, and it is our common obligation to ensure that it will also be enlightened.
