## (s4) PATHOGENESIS
(p4.0) The mechanism for the development of MC component in CIAM is not well understood. Earlier, authors postulated that CIAM represents a form of collision tumor wherein the two components arise from two different clones and they coincidentally occur adjacent to one another[8]. However, evolving knowledge regarding the multipotent stem cells in the gut and their role in tumorigenesis has shed light on the possible histogenesis of tumors with different histologic components such as CIAM. Indeed, in vitro studies of the ileal epithelial cells (IEC-18) of rat have shown that these cells can transform into differing cell types with one type showing neuroendocrinelike morphology and expressing serotonin receptor gene, and the other with adenomalike mRNA transcription and protein expression [24].
## (s13) Collision tumor
(p13.0) Recently, Schizas et al [55] carried out a literature review on collision tumors of the digestive system. In this review, the authors defined collision tumors as those consisting of two or more independent neoplasms without intermingling (thus December 16, 2021
