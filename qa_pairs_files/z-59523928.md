## (s4) Metrizability and normality.
(p4.0) LCA-groups G with metrizable and normal space S(G) are characterized by S. Panasyuk in the candidate thesis Normality and metrizability of the space of closed subgroups, Kyiv University, 1989. These lists are completely constructive but too cumbrous so we formulate only Theorem 2.4. For a discrete Abelian group G, the following statements are equivalent

(p4.1) (iii) G has a finitely generated subgroup H such that G/H = C p ∞ 1 × . . . × C p ∞ n , where p 1 , . . . , p n are distinct primes.

(p4.2) In general case, metrizability and normality of S(G) are not equivalent but if G a connected semisimple Lie group then S(G) is metrizable iff S(G) is normal iff G is compact, see [36], [37]. The space S(G) of every connected solvable Lie group is metrizable [36].
