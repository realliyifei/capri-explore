(p3.0) • In §3 after the preliminaries, we show that for any 2 < n < ω and any k ≥ 3, the variety SNr n CA n+k is not atom-canonical.

(p3.1) • In §4 we show that several classes consisting of algebras having a neat embedding property are not first order definable. As a sample, we show that for any finite n > 1, the class Nr n CA ω is not closed under ≡ ∞,ω and that for any 2 < n < ω, any class K, such that S d Nr n CA ω ⊆ K ⊆ S c Nr n CA n+3 , K is not elementary, cf. theorem 4. 3.
