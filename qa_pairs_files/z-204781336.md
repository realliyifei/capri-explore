(p13.0) Several pre-processing techniques have used to process psychophysiological data.For instance, the main neuroimaging corrections methods for fMRI data are slice time correction, motion correction, normalization and co-registration.PCA and ICA have been used for the feature extraction process of fMRI data.The pre-processing of EEG data includes artefact-based neuroimaging correction and uses high-pass filters for noise removal in ASDGenus approach [32].Among the widely used techniques, forwards selection is used to reduce dimensionality and FFT, Sym5 have used to extract features.Considering the classification learning models, SVM has been widely used for ADHD classification.However, as an emerging technology, DM techniques can be used as a future research direction, to increase the classification accuracy and result optimization.
## (s14) Related Neuroimaging Classification Studies
(p14.0) Neuroscience Decision Support Systems are computerized systems that are used to solve complex problems and decision making based on neuroscience measurements.These decision support systems are created on top of the existing feature selection, extraction and classifiers implementations.The appraised models were selected based on the latest studies and their accuracy levels, usability, scalability etc.

(p14.1) An ADHD classification model based on structural and functional MRI using the 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is presented by Zou [27].As shown in iJOE -Vol.15, No. 13, 2019  Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based classification of ADHD using brain structural MRI data, is addressed by Peng [29].As the pre-processing technique, motion correction has applied to MRI data and 340 features have divided into sets of 68 components based on brain segments as shown in Figure 2.

(p14.2) Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) and F-Score were applied for feature selection to achieve high classification accuracy, after the normalization.Then the ELM and SVM were used to perform the leave one out cross validation for the dataset.However, they have considered only the structural MRI data from the ADHD-200 Global Competition.
## (s15) Evaluation Techniques
(p15.0) Several evaluation methods have been used to evaluate the classification accuracy.The Holdout method divides the original data set into two sets as testing and training.Then the classifier builds on training data set and evaluates it on testing data set which was held out.This method can be improved by repeating the same process by selecting a random set of data for training and testing in every turn [14] [27].K-fold crossvalidation is another evaluation method.It partitions the data set into equal sizes of k subsets and each subset is used as a test set and the remaining set is used as a training data.The accuracy of each turn with different testing sets, folds, are averaged to prevent the overlapping of test sets and to increase efficiency [29].Leave one out crossvalidation is a special case of the k-fold validation method.It uses a test set of size one and every subject is used as a test subject in turn.This also increases the efficiency of the dataset by avoiding the random selection issues in the datasets.Further, generalized error estimation is considered to average the results for the available training points.
