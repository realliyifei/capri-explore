## (s2) G-Edge Completion
(p2.0) For example, when G is the class of chordal graphs, then this is the Chordal Completion problem, that is the problem of adding at most k edges to make an input graph chordal, i.e., containing no induced cycle of length more than three. If G is the class of 2-edge connected graphs, then this is the 2-Edge-Connectivity Augmentation problem. One natural question to ask is why it is that case that Chordal Completion is NP-complete [258], whereas 2-Edge-Connectivity Augmentation (for unweighted graphs) is solvable in polynomial time [105].

(p2.1) In the G-Edge Deletion problem, the task is to decide whether a given graph G can be transformed into a graph in G by deleting at most k edges. We use the notation G − F , where F ⊆ E(G), to denote the graph with the vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G) \ F . Then we define G-Edge Deletion as follows:

LLM judge: YES

## (s4) G-Edge Deletion
(p4.0) For example, when G is the class of acyclic graphs, then G-Edge Deletion is trivially solvable in polynomial time (finding a minimum spanning tree). When G is the class of bipartite graphs, the problem is known as Odd Cycle Transversal 1 and is NP-complete [259].

(p4.1) Finally, in the G-Edge Editing problem the task is to decide whether a given graph G can be transformed into a graph G + F + − F − in G using at most |F + | + |F − | = k edges. For a set F of pairs of V (G), we denote by G F the graph with vertex set V (G), and whose edge set is the symmetric difference of E(G) and F . We define G-Edge Editing as follows:

## (s7) Open problem 2.2 ([78]). Does Line Graph Deletion admit a polynomial kernel?
(p7.0) Similar questions are open for Line Graph Completion and Line Graph Editing. There has also been some attempt to generalize the approach of Cai and Cai [49] to families of hereditary graphs characterized by not only a single obstruction but a finite number of them. This gave the very nice result contained in the work of Aravind, Sandeep, and Sivadasan [8], but which is valid only for restricted input graphs: if the input graphs have bounded degree and if the graphs in F are connected, then the F-free edge Deletion problem admits a polynomial kernel.

(p7.1) Among the classes of graphs listed in Table 1, one received a particular attention: cluster graphs (see the survey by Böcker and Baumbach [22] for more on the topic). The reason is that cluster graph modification problems, more precisely deletion and editing, are closely related to the question of community detection, which is central in the domain of complex networks. It is striking to see that despite the simplicity of the structure of cluster graphs (they are disjoint union of cliques), both the editing and deletion problems remain NP-complete. Completion is trivially polynomial: simply turn each connected component into a clique. From a kernelization perspective, Gramm et al. [144] first showed the existence of a k 3 kernel both for Cluster Deletion and Cluster Editing. The editing kernel was improved to linear size, namely 6k, by Fellows et al. [108] and there were several works putting efforts to further reduce the size of the kernel to 4k, by Guo [153], and then to 2k by Chen and Meng [67] and by Cao and Chen [55] independently. The same efforts were put in trying to obtain the best possible complexity for FPT algorithms solving these modification problems. Gramm et al. [144] first obtained a 2.27 k complexity for editing and 1.77 k for deletion, which was improved by Böcker and Damaschke [25] to 1.76 k and 1.41 k respectively.

## (s8) Open problem 2.3 ([249]
(p8.0) ). Is Cograph Editing (editing to a P 4 -free graph) with + k edits, where is the number of vertex disjoint induced P 4 s in the input graph, FPT parameterized by k?

(p8.1) Many variants of the problem of cluster editing have been considered in the literature. They are not listed in Table 1 and we report them below. Guo et al. generalized the Cluster Editing problem to a problem called s-Plex Editing [156]. An s-plex is one way of generalizing the notion of a clique. A set S is an s-plex in a graph G if every vertex v ∈ S has degree at least |S| − s in G[S]. Hence, a clique is a 1-plex. A graph G is then an s-plex cluster if every connected component is an s-plex. They show that the s-plex cluster graphs are characterizable by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs and they give an O(s 2 k) vertex kernel for the problem as well as an O( √ s k )-time FPT algorithm. It is worth noting that the number of obstructions of these classes depends exponentially on s, but each of the obstructions is of size O(s).

(p8.2) In [107], another relaxed version of the cluster editing problem is studied, where a vertex (s-vertexoverlap) or an edge (s-edge-overlap) is allowed to participate in at most s clusters, where s is part of the input. All the corresponding modification problems are shown to be NP-hard when s ≥ 1 (s ≥ 2 in the case of completion), W[1]-hard when parameterized by k and FPT parameterized by (s, k). The authors of [107] also give an O(k 4 ) kernel for 1-edge-overlap edge Deletion (which is exactly diamond-free edge Deletion) and an O(k 3 ) kernel for 2-vertex-overlap edge Deletion.

(p8.3) Other results about different approaches to clustering problems are given in Section 3. Xia and Zhang [255] studied the problems s-cycle Transversal and ≤ s-cycle Transversal. In these problems, the task is to find a set of edges S ⊆ E(G) of a given graph G of size at most some given budget k, such that every (not necessarily induced) cycle of length (at most) s in G has an edge in S. For s = 3 these problems become Triangle-Free edge Deletion, which is known to admit a linear kernel [42]. Xia and Zhang show that ≤ s-cycle Transversal is NP-complete, even on planar graphs of maximum degree seven, for any s ≥ 3. They give a 6k 2 vertex kernel for both 4-cycle Transversal and ≤ 4-cycle Transversal, implying that the {C 3 , C 4 }-free edge Deletion problem admits a 6k 2 kernel. The problems were already known to admit O(k s−1 ) vertex kernels by a reduction to Hitting Set [255,1].

(p8.4) Due to the structure of the two classes, the modification problems into threshold graphs and chain graphs are closely related. Guo [152] gave a cubic vertex kernel for Threshold Completion and Threshold Deletion (the class is auto-complementary) and Bessy et al. [16] gave a quadratic kernel for Chain Deletion. (The characterizations of all these graph classes in the form of forbidden subgraphs is given in Table 1.) Until recently, it was unknown whether Threshold Editing and Chain Editing were NP-hard or not. This was shown by Drange et al. [98], who obtained quadratic kernels for all three modification problems towards threshold graphs and chain graphs. Furthermore, Chain Deletion was shown to be solvable in 2.57 k n O(1) time by Liu et al. [200]. For split graphs completion and deletion (graphs excluding {2K 2 , C 4 , C 5 }), Guo [152] initially gave a k 4 kernel which was later improved to k 2 [130].

## (s9) Classes characterized by an infinite number of minimal forbidden subgraphs
(p9.0) Although many studied graph classes are finitely characterizable, there are important examples that are outside this regime, such as chordal graphs (defined as graphs with no induced cycle of length at least four) or interval graphs (chordal graphs without asteroidal triples) for example. Therefore, Cai's theorem does not directly cover modification problems into chordal or interval graphs. However, consider the problem Chordal Completion, which constituted a seminal case study for parameterized complexity of edge modification problems. Given an input instance (G, k) of Chordal Completion, we may observe that if G has an induced cycle of length more than k + 3, then (G, k) is a no-instance [47]. Therefore, even though chordal graphs do not have a finite characterization, the set of obstacles can be bounded by a function of k: (G, k) is a yes-instance of Chordal Completion if and only if (G, k) is a yes-instance of H-free edge Completion for H = {C 4 , C 5 , . . . , C k+4 } and the H-free graph output is chordal. Thanks to this fundamental property, Kaplan, Shamir, and Tarjan [174] showed as early as 1994 that Chordal Completion (usually called Minimum Fill-In) can be solved in 16 k · n O(1) time and admits a polynomial kernel with O(k 3 ) vertices. In 1996, Cai improved their result on Chordal Completion by giving an FPT algorithm for the problem running in time O(4 k · (n + m)) [47] and in 2000, the analysis of the kernelization algorithm of [174] was improved by Natanzon, Shamir, and Sharan [226] to show that it actually produces a kernel of size O(k 2 ). For deletion and editing, no polynomial kernel is known.

## (s14) Open problem 2.14 ([97]). Does Edge Bipartization admit a deterministic polynomial kernel?
(p14.0) Finally, let us mention the class of linear forests, which are the graphs whose connected components are paths. Though the class is pretty simple, it does not admit a finite number of forbidden subgraphs. Feng, Zhou, and Li showed that Linear Forest Deletion admits a polynomial kernel with 9k vertices [109]. They also provide an O(2.29 k n O(1) ) time randomized FPT algorithm for solving the problem.

(p14.1) There are many important hereditary classes for which the parameterized complexity of the edge modification problems is still unknown. Among them are comparability, co-comparability and permutation graphs, which are subclasses of perfect graphs, as well as circular-arc and circle graphs. Obtaining positive or negative results for any of these classes would be of high interest. In particular, the following questions were already asked in the literature.

LLM judge: YES

## (s17) Subexponential time algorithms
(p17.0) As usual in algorithms, a natural, but difficult, question to ask is about lower bounds. The case of parameterized complexity is not different. Once a problem has been shown to admit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, a natural next question is whether it is possible to improve upon that algorithm. This is especially interesting when the algorithms have running times that are of the order 2 Ω(k 2 ) · n O(1) , or even 2 Ω(2 k ) · n O(1) .

(p17.1) As mentioned above, the modification problems for finite forbidden induced subgraphs already have nice running times like 6 k · n O(1) or even 3 k · n O(1) and 2 k · n O(1) . Is it possible to obtain faster algorithms? Can we improve from 3 k n O(1) to, say, 2 k n O(1) or 1.5 k n O(1) ? Are there reasons to suspect that we cannot get better than 2 k · n O(1) algorithms? These questions were at the core of what is known as the optimality programme, see for example [213].

LLM judge: YES

## (s19) Related results
(p19.0) In some cases, the input graph is naturally a bipartite graph. The Chain Completion problem is the problem of making a bipartite graph a bipartite chain graph, that is, a bipartite graph with no induced 2K 2 . The problem was first shown to admit a polynomial kernel by Guo [152] when the bipartition is fixed. Fomin and Villanger showed that this version of the problem admits a subexponential time algorithm [122] and Bliznets et al. [17] showed that it cannot be solved in time O(2 k 1/4 ) unless ETH fails. Drange et al. [98] relaxed the input requirements, showing that the problem still admits a quadratic kernel even when the bipartition is not fixed.

(p19.1) In the Minimum Flip Consensus Tree problem, we are asked to turn an input bipartite graph into a bipartite graph with same partition that contains no P 5 starting from any top vertex, called a consensus tree. This kind of graph, a consensus tree, arises in computational phylogenetics, with the bottom vertices being characters and the top vertices being the taxa. The problem is solvable in time c k n O(1) by Cai's theorem. Chen [65] proved that it is NP-complete and gave an O(6 k n 2 ) FPT algorithm, which was later improved to O(4.42 k n) by Böcker, Bui and Truss [24]. Finally, Komusiewicz and Uhlmann [182] gave a O(3.68 k n 3 ) algorithm and a O(k 3 ) kernel for Minimum Flip Consensus Tree.

(p19.2) Several variants of cluster editing were introduced for the special case of bipartite graphs. The main one, called Bicluster Editing, aims at obtaining a union of complete bipartite graphs. It admits a 4k linear kernel and a FPT algorithm running in O(3.24 k + |E|) [155]. Drange et al. [101] considered the extension of p-Cluster Editing to Bicluster Editing and the more general t-Partite Cluster Editing, yielding the problems p-Bicluster Editing and t-Partite p-Cluster Editing. None of the classical parameterized versions are solvable in subexponential time, but fixing the number p of connected components in the solution, the problems become solvable in subexponential time. In [101], it is shown that a problem called p-Starforest Editing is solvable in time O(2 3 √ pk + m + n), whereas an algorithm of running time 2 O(p √ k log(pk)) + O(m + n) is given for p-Bicluster Editing, as well as t-Partite p-Cluster Editing.

(p19.3) Let us also mention that for planar input graphs, Xia and Zhang [255] give a linear kernel for 5-cycle Transversal and ≤ 5-cycle Transversal, thereby showing that {C 3 , C 4 , C 5 }-free Deletion, or Girth-6 Deletion admits a linear kernel on planar graphs.

(p19.4) A non-hereditary variant of Edge Bipartization is edge deletion toward König graphs. An undirected graph is a König graph if it admits a vertex cover of size equal to the size of its maximum matching. This class contains all bipartite graphs, but not every König graph is bipartite; for example, a triangle with a pendant vertex attached to one vertex is a König graph. For the following König Edge Deletion problem, it is known that it is at least as hard as Almost 2-SAT. Its vertex-deletion variant is known to be FPT [204].

## (s23) Edge Multiway Cut
(p23.0) The related problem is Vertex Multiway Cut, where one wants to delete at most k vertices to separate terminals. For most of the variants of the cut problems an FPT-algorithm for edge-deletion version can be obtained from the vertex-deletion variant. This is why most of the work in the area was concentrated on vertex-deletions.

(p23.1) For |T | = 2, Edge Multiway Cut is the classical Min-Cut and is solvable in polynomial time due to its duality with the maximum flow problem [123]. However, as it was shown by Dalhaus et al. [84], Edge Multiway Cut is NP-complete for |T | = 3.

## (s25) Open problem 3.5 ([77]). Does Edge Multicut admit a polynomial kernel on directed acyclic graphs, when parameterized by k and |T |? Or when parameterized by k and when the number of terminal pairs is constant?
(p25.0) Bringmann et al. [41] provide a detailed study of the following generalization of Edge Multicut. In the Steiner Multicut we are given an undirected graph G, a collection T = {T 1 , ..., T t }, T i ⊆ V (G), of terminal sets of size at most p, and an integer k. The task is to decide whether there is a set S of at most k edges such that of each set T i at least one pair of terminals is in different connected components of G − S. Edge Multicut is the special case for p = 2.

LLM judge: YES

## (s28) Open problem 3.8. What is the parameterized complexity of deciding for given graph G and integers p and q, if G contains a set of vertices X such that |X| = p and |∂(X)| ≤ q with parameter p or q?
(p28.0) The related Bisection problem, the problem of separating a graph into two equally large graphs cutting at most k edges, was shown to be solvable in time 2 O(k 3 ) · n O(1) by Cygan et al. [79]. The incompressibility of the problem was shown by van Bevern et al. [248].

(p28.1) Lokshtanov and Marx also show that when µ is monotone, then the solution for Terminal (µ, p, q)-Cut can be in polynomial time transformed into a solution of the following (µ,p, q)-Partition problem. In this problem we are given a graph G and the task is to decide whether there is a partition of the vertex set V (G) into (µ, p, q)-clusters. In particular, since for every monotone polynomial time computable function µ, Terminal (µ, p, q)-Cut is solvable in time n O(q) by a brute-force algorithm trying all cuts of size at most q, this yields that (µ,p, q)-Partition is solvable in time n O(q) .

(p28.2) Kim et al. [177] considered a related problem, under name Min-Max Multiway Cut, where we are given a graph G, a non-negative integer , and a set T of terminals, the question is whether we can partition the vertices of G into |T | parts such that (a) each part contains one terminal and (b) there are at most edges with only one endpoint in this part. They gave an algorithm solving this problem in time 2 O(( |T |) 2 log |T |) n 4 log n.

(p28.3) An interesting variant of Edge Multicut was introduced by Chitnes et al. [68] under the name Chain SAT. In the graph version, the problem can be phrases as follows. The input is a parameter k and a directed graph G with specified source s and sink t. The edges of G are partitioned into sets E 1 , . . . , E m , such that each E i is an edge-set of a path of length at most L. The goal is to select k sets E i , such that if you delete edges from all selected E i s, then there is no path from s to t. That is, the edges of the graph are bundled into paths of length at most L and one pays one to delete edges of one bundle.

## (s29) Open problem 3.9 ([68]). Is Chain SAT FPT parameterized by L?
(p29.0) Parameterized complexity of the multi-budgeted variant of Edge Multicut, where arcs are colored and the required cut should contain a certain amount of arcs of each color, was investigated by Kratsch et al. in [187].

(p29.1) Another problem of cutting a graph is Minimum k-way Cut of Bounded Size, where we are given graph G and integers k and s. The task is to decide whether there is a set of at most s edges X such that G − X has at least k connected components. Downey et al. [94] prove that the problem parameterized by k is W[1] -hard. Kawarabayashi and Thorup [176] show that the problem is fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by s.

## (s30) Connectivity
(p30.0) In this subsection we discuss results around connectivity augmentation problems. In such problems the input is a (multi) graph and the objective is to increase edge or vertex connectivity by adding the minimum number (weight) of additional edges, called links.

(p30.1) This problem was first studied by Eswaran and Tarjan [105] who showed that increasing the edge connectivity of a given graph to 2 by adding a minimum number of links (also called an augmenting set) is polynomial time solvable. Subsequent work of Watanabe and Nakamura [253], Cai and Sun [46], and Frank [124] established that the problem is also polynomial time solvable for any given target value of edge connectivity to be achieved. However, if the set of links is restricted, that is, there are pairs of vertices in the graph which do not constitute a link, or if the links have (non-identical) weights on them, then the problem of computing the minimum size (or weight) augmenting set is NP-complete [105].

(p30.2) It is interesting to note that the vertex version of the problem is substantially less understood even when the set of links which can be added is unrestricted. Vegh [251] obtain a polynomial time solution for the special case when the connectivity of the graph is required to increase by 1. The complexity of the general case is open. Jackson and Jordán [170] gave a 2 O(λ) n O(1) -time algorithm for the problem of finding a minimum number of edges to make a graph λ-vertex connected. Let us note, that according to the current knowledge, the problem still can be solved in polynomial time.

(p30.3) In the Weighted Minimum-Cost Edge-Connectivity Augmentation by One, we are given graph G which is λ-edge connected, set of links L, integer k, weight function w on L, p ∈ R. The task is to decide whether there is a link set F ⊆ L such that w(F ) ≤ p, |F | ≤ k and G ∪ F is λ + 1-edge connected?

(p30.4) The first parameterized algorithm for the connectivity augmentation problem was considered by Nagamochi [224], who gave a 2 O(k log k) |V | O(1) algorithm for the case when the weights on the links are identical and λ is odd. Guo and Uhlmann [158] gave a kernel with O(k 2 ) vertices and links for the same case. Marx and Vegh [216] studied the problem in its full generality and gave a kernel with O(k) vertices, O(k 3 ) links and weights of (k 6 log k) bit integers. Basavaraju et al. [9] gave an algorithm solving Weighted Minimum-Cost Edge-Connectivity Augmentation by One in time 9 k n O(1) .

## (s31) Clustering
(p31.0) One of the simplest variants of clustering is Cluster Editing or Correlation Clustering, where the task is to delete/add in total at most k edges from/to graph G such that every connected component of the obtained graph is a clique. Since a clique is a graph containing no induced path P 3 , Cluster Editing is also a special case of the problem of editing to a graph class characterised by a finite number of minimal forbidden subgraphs. This is why we discussed this problem in Section 2.1. However, different variants of clustering do not fit this scheme and we discuss them here.

(p31.1) One can generalize the concept of cluster graphs as follows. A graph is a s-club cluster if every connected component has diameter at most s. These graph classes are not hereditary, as adding a universal vertex will transform any graph into a 2-club cluster. Liu, Zhang, and Zhu [196]  As mentioned earlier, Cluster Editing does not admit a subexponential time algorithm [181] unless ETH fails. On the other hand, the problem p-Cluster Editing, where the number of components in the target class is fixed to be exactly p-rather surprisingly-does indeed admit a subexponential parameterized time algorithm. This was shown by Fomin et al. [119], who designed an algorithm solving this problem in time 2 O( √ pk) · n O(1) . The p-Cluster Editing problem, as well as p-Cluster Deletion was first studied by Shamir, Sharan, and Tsur [239], who showed that even 2-Cluster Deletion is NP-complete. Hüffner et al. [166] considered parameterized complexity and kernelization of a clustering variant called Highly Connected Deletion. In this problem one seeks to delete at most k edges such that, in the resulting graph, each vertex in each connected component is adjacent to at least half of the vertices of this component. See also the work of Bliznets and Karpov for further improvements and other variants of this problem [21]. Golovach and Thilikos [139] studied a related notion of connectivity clustering, where the task is to delete at most k edges to obtain clusters of given size and of given connectivity.

(p31.2) Finally, let us mention that for weighted graphs, the Cluster Editing problem also admits a 2k kernel with integer weights [55] and an FPT algorithm in O(1.82 k ) time [23]. The parameterized complexity of the dynamic version of Cluster Editing was studied by Luo et al. [209].

## (s33) Modification to satisfy individual degree constraints

## (s37) Open problem 4.1. Is it possible to give efficient FPT algorithms for DCE(S) and/or WDCE(S) parameterized by k + r for general degree list functions?
(p37.0) For the case vertex deletion ∈ S ⊆ {vertex deletion, edge deletion} and single-element degree lists, Mathieson and Szeider [219] showed that WDCE(S) admits a kernel with O(kr(k + r)) vertices. For general degree lists, they demonstrated a kernel with O(k 2 r k+1 + kr k+2 ) vertices. These results were complemented by Froese, Nichterlein and Niedermeier [127], who proved that if only edge additions are allowed (i.e, for the completion problem), then DCE(S) has kernels with O(kr 2 ) and O(r 5 ) vertices, that is, it admits a polynomial kernel whose size depends only on r. To obtain the latter result, they prove that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if k is sufficiently large (greater that some polynomial of r). The latter result is based on a clever application of combinatorial results about existence of f -factors. Hence, the following win-win approach can be used: if k is large, then the problem is solved in polynomial time, and if k is bounded by a polynomial of r, then the kernelization algorithm for the case where the parameter is k + r is applied. Froese, Nichterlein and Niedermeier [127] also give lower bounds by proving that DCE(S) parameterized by k + r has no polynomial kernel unless NP ⊆ coNP/poly if S = {vertex deletion} or S = {edge addition}. Another lower bound for this parameterization was given by Golovach [133] who proved that DCE(S) with degree lists of size one has no polynomial kernel unless NP ⊆ coNP/poly if {vertex deletion, edge addition} ⊆ S.

(p37.1) The variant of DCE(S) with degree lists of size one, where S ⊆ {vertex deletion, edge deletion} and where we are given separate bounds k v and k e for the number of vertex and edge deletions respectively, was considered by Dabrowski et al. [83] on planar graphs. They proved that the problem admits a polynomial kernel when parameterized by k v + k e .

(p37.2) Golovach [134] introduced the degree constrained modification problem with connectivity restrictions. In [134] it was called Edge Editing to a Connected Graph of Given Degrees but later the other title Edge Editing to Connected f -Degree Graph was proposed and we use it in the survey.

## (s44) Open problem 4.4. Investigate the parameterized complexity of variants of DCF(S) and EECG for directed graphs.
(p44.0) Besides vertex degree constraints, it could be interesting to consider edge degree constraints or combined vertex and edge degree constraints. In particular, Mathieson [218] considered a number of problems of this type. For a edge weighted graph, the weighted degree of a vertex is defined as the sum of weights of incident edges. Respectively, the weighted sum of an edge is the sum of the vertex degrees of its end-points. Mathieson [218] considered the following problems for edge weighted graphs:

(p44.1) • Weighted Edge Degree Constraint Editing, where for each edge, it is given a list of weighted degrees, and the aim is to obtain a graph, by at most k modification operations, such that every vertex has a degree from its list.

(p44.2) • Weighted Bounded Degree Editing, where a degree bound for each vertex is given, and the aim is to obtain a graph, by at most k modification operations, such that the weighted degree of a vertex does not exceed its bound.

(p44.3) • Weighted Edge Regularity Editing, where for each vertex, it is given a list of weighted degrees, and for each pair of vertices, it is given a set of feasible sizes of the set of common neighbors, and the aim is to obtain a graph, by at most k modification operations, such that every vertex has the weighted degree from its list and for every edge, the size of the set of common neighbors is feasible.

(p44.4) • Weighted Strongly Regular Editing, that is a variant of Weighted Edge Regularity Editing, where additionally a second set of allowed sizes of the set of common neighbors is given for each pair of vertices, and for every pair of nonneighbors of the modified graph, the size of the set of common neighbors should belong to this set.

(p44.5) The allowed modification operations are vertex deletions, edge deletions and edge additions. Mathieson presented the essentially complete picture of the complexity of these problems parameterized by the number of modification operations k and/or the upper bound of the feasible degrees for various combinations of allowed operations: the cases when the problems are W[1]-hard, FPT, have polynomial kernels or do not have them up to some conjectures are distinguished. He also investigated special cases, in particular, the unweighted problems (i.e., the problems for unit weights) and the case when the sets of feasible degrees are singletons. Additionally, the structural parameterization by the treewidth of an input graph was considered. We do not discuss the details of these results, because they proved to be similar to the results about DCS(S) and are obtained by similar techniques. Another direction of research would be to consider the discussed problems for graph classes. Up to now, a very little work was done in this direction. Dabrowski et al. [83] considered variants of DCF(S) and EECG for planar graphs. More precisely, they considered the problems that asks for a given planar graph G, a degree function f : V (G) → N 0 and two non-negative integers k e and k v , whether it is possible to obtain a (connected) graph G from G with d G (v) = f (v) for v ∈ V (G ) by deleting at most k v vertices and at most k e edges. Notice that G is not required to be planar. They proved that these problems have polynomial kernels when parameterized by k v + k e . In fact, more general kernalization results were obtained as it is shown that it could be assumed that vertices and edges have costs and the task is to delete at most k v and k e to satisfy degree restriction and achieve the minimum total cost of deleted vertices and edges. This result is obtained via the protrusion decomposition/replacement techniques introduced by Bodlaender et al. [29].

(p51.0) Here d − G (v) and d + G (v) denote in-and out-degree of a vertex v in a graph G. Notice that if f (v) = 0, then the question is equivalent to asking whether we can obtain an Eulerian graph by at most k operations.

(p51.1) Generalizing the results of Boesch, Suffel and Tindell [32], Dabrowski, Golovach, van 't Hof and Paulusma [82] proved that CPCE(S) and CDBE(S) are polynomial if S = {edge (arc) addition}. Moreover, the problems remain polynomial if S = {edge (arc) addition, edge (arc) deletion}. It can be also observed that the same holds for PCE(S). If vertex deletion ∈ S, then CPCE(S), PCE(S) and CDBE(S) are NP-hard and W[1]-hard by the results of Cai and Yang [50], Cygan et al. [80] and Dabrowski et al. [82]. The most interesting from the parameterized complexity viewpoint case is the case S = {edge (arc) deletion} for CPCE(S) and CDBE(S) (PCE(S) is polynomial in this case as it was proven by Cygan, Marx, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk and Schlotter [80]).

(p51.2) Cygan et al. [80] observed that if S = {edge (arc) deletion}, then CPCE(S) and CDBE(S) are NP-complete. They also proved that they can be solved in time 2 O(k log k) · poly(n) and complemented these results by proving that these problems have no polynomial kernel unless NP ⊆ coNP/poly. Their FPT result is based on the following structural observation. If G is an undirected graph and T is the set of vertices for which degree constraints are broken, then the edges of a solution form a T -join, that is, they induce a forest that could be decomposed into edge disjoint paths that connect |T |/2 pairs of vertices of T . Hence, the task is to find a T -join of size at most k such that the deletion of the edges of the join does not destroy connectivity. Cygan et al. [80] use a non-trivial application of the color coding technique to solve this problem. Similar techniques work also for directed graphs. Their results were improved by Goyal et al. [143]. They showed that CPCE(S) and CDBE(S) for S = {edge (arc) deletion} can be solved in time 2 O(k) · poly(n). They use the same structural observations as Cygan et al. [80], but instead of color coding, they apply matroid representative sets techniques. In particular, for undirected graphs, they use the fact that the set of edges of a T -join is an independent set of the cographic (bond) matriod. It should be noted that Cygan et al. [80] and Goyal et al. [143] gave their results for the Eulerian Edge Deletion problem, that is for the special cases of CPCE(S) and CDBE(S) where f (v) = 0 (Goyal et al. [143] considered also Connected Odd Edge Deletion), but the algorithm could be rewritten for CPCE(S) and CDBE(S) in a straightforward way.

(p51.3) Observe that in CPCE(S) and CDBE(S) the parameter k upper bounds the number of modification operations. We can ask whether the modifications can be done by exactly k operations. In particular, Cai and Yang [50] left open the following problem.

## (s56) Weighted Multigraph Eulerian Completion (WMEC)
(p56.0) Since WMEC deals with multigraphs, the addition of parallel arcs is allowed. It can be noted that the classical Chinese Postman problem, where the aim is to find a shortest closed walk that visits all arcs of a given directed graph, and the more general Rural Postman, where it is required to find a shortest walk that visits a given set of arcs, can be seen as special cases of WMEC. Dorn et al. [93] showed that WMEC can be solved in time O(4 k · n 3 ). This results immediately implies the respective FPT result for Rural Postman. They conjecture that similar result can be obtained for undirected graphs. They also leave open the question about the variant with arc deletion. Generalizing it, we obtain the following open problem.

## (s57) Modification to satisfy degree sequence constraints
(p57.0) In this section we consider problems where the task is to modify a graph in order to satisfy constraints on degree sequences. Motivations for the problems considered here often come from applications like social networks. The identity disclosure is a specific type of privacy breach in social networks. It happens when an adversary is able to determine the identity of an entity in a network. One can weaken this to the existence disclosure, where one is able to identify whether an entity is present in a social network or not. Affiliation link disclosure is the problem to determine whether an entity belongs to a specific group in a social network. As Zheleva and Getoor [260] say in their survey, k-anonymity protection of data is met if the information for each person contained in the data cannot be distinguished from at least k − 1 other individuals in the data.

(p57.1) In degree anonymization, a graph is said to be s-degree-anonymous (or simply s-anonymous when it is clear from context that we are talking about degree anonymity) if for every vertex v, there are at least s − 1 vertices with the same degree as v. This leads to the modification problems where the aim is to achieve the desired level of anonymity by bounded number of operations. We refer to the survey of Casas-Roma, Herrera-Joancomartí and Torra [61] for the introduction to the edge modification techniques used in anonymization and focus on the parameterized complexity of the problems. Following the style used in the previous section, we define the following problem for a set of modification operations S.

## (s63) Π-Degree Sequence Completion (Π-DSC)
(p63.0) Notice that Π is a tuple property. In particular, DCE({edge addition)} is not a special case of Π-DSC, but Anonymization({edge addition}) is. They introduced the auxiliary Π-Decision problem that asks whether an n-tuple T = (d 1 , . . . , d n ) of non-negative integers satisfies Π and proved, using the previous results about Anonymization({edge addition}) [162], that if Π-Decision is FPT when parameterized by ∆ = max{d i | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}, then Π-DSC is FPT when parameterized by ∆ + k. Recall now that Bredereck et al. [39] proved that Anonymization({edge addition}) is FPT when parameterized by ∆ and has a kernel with O(∆ 7 ) vertices. Generalizing this result, Froese et al. [127] defined the Π-Number Sequence Completion (Π-NSC) problem that asks for a sequence d 1 , . . . , d n of non-negative integers and two non-negative integers k and ∆ , whether there are non-negative integers x 1 , . . . , x n such that the n-tuple T = (d 1 + x 1 , . . . , d n + x n ) satisfies Π,

(p63.1) . . , n}. They proved that if Π-NSC is FPT when parameterized by ∆ , then Π-DSC if FPT when parameterized by ∆ where ∆ is the maximum degree of the output graph. It is also shown that if Π-NSC can be solved in polynomial time and Π-DSC has a polynomial in k and ∆ kernel, then Π-DSC has a polynomial kernel when parameterized by ∆ . Froese et al. [127] were interested only in edge additions, but it is tempting to extend their results for other modification operations.

## (s64) Modification to satisfy subgraph degree constraints
(p64.0) In the above part of the section, we considered the problems where the modification aim is to make a graph to satisfy given degree constraints. In Section 2, we considered the problems where the task is to obtain a graph that does not contain a given induced subgraph. Nevertheless, it is also possible to ask the question whether we can perform modifications to achieve the property that the obtained graph has an induced subgraph with certain properties. In particular, the desired properties of a subgraph can include degree constraints.

(p64.1) An induced subgraph H of a graph G is said to be a k-core for a non-negative integer k if the minimum degree δ(H) of H is at least k. The introduction of this notion by Seidman [238] is motivated by the importance of k-cores in (social) networks. Intuitively, a k-core for a sufficiently large k is a "stable" part of a network. Chitnis and Talmon asked in [70] whether it is possible to create a big k-core by edge additions. Formally, the Edge k-Core problem asks, given a graph G and nonnegative integers k, p and b, whether it is possible to add at most b edges to G in such a way that the obtained graph has a k-core with at least p vertices. Chitnis and Talmon proved that this problem is NP-complete and analyzed its behavior with respect to the parameterizations by k, p, b and the treewidth of the input graph. It is shown that Edge k-Core is W[1]-hard when parameterized by k + p + k but can be solved in time (k + tw) b+tw poly(n), where tw is the treewidth of the input graph.

## (s69) Diameter Augmentation
(p69.0) The problem is known to be NP-hard even if d = 2 [193] as it was shown by Li, McCormick and Simchi-Levi, and it was proved by Gao, Hare and Nastos that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by k even if d = 2. Frati et al. [125] studied a more general weighted optimization version of Diameter Augmentation, where we have a weighted graph with a weight function w : V (G) × V (G) → N and a cost function c : V (G) × V (G) → N and an integer bound B. The goal is to add a set of edges F such that c(F ) = e∈F c(e) ≤ B, and the diameter of G + F is minimum. Frati et al. [125] gave an FPT 4-approximation algorithm running in time 3 B poly(n, B). They also established some inapproximability results.

## (s70) Local edge modifications
(p70.0) In the previous sections, we were dealing with edge modification problems where the only constraint on the set of modified edges itself was its cardinality. Nevertheless, there are problems when the set of modified edges should satisfy some additional, usually local, combinatorial property. In this subsection, we consider such problems.

(p70.1) Seidel's switching is a graph operation which makes a given vertex adjacent to precisely those vertices to which it was non-adjacent before, while keeping the rest of the graph unchanged. In [185], Kratochvíl, Nešetřil, and Zýka initiated the study of the Switching to C problem, whose task is to decide whether a graph can be modified to belong to a given graph class C by a series of Seidel's switching. There are various algorithmic and hardness results for the problem, but since we are interested in Parameterized Complexity, we only mention the results of Jelínková, Suchý, Hlinený, and Kratochvíl [172]. In particular, they proved that if C is the class of graphs of minimum (maximum, respectively) degree at least (at most, respectively) d or the class of d-regular graphs, then the problem is FPT when parameterized by d.

## (s74) Beyond forbidden subgraphs
(p74.0) In Section 2, we considered editing problems whose task is to obtain a graph belonging to a given hereditary graph class, that is, a graph class defined by a family of forbidden induced subgraphs. Here we survey some variations and generalizations of these problems.

(p74.1) Besides forbidding induced subgraphs, it is possible to forbid other structures. In particular, there is a plethora of results for graph classes defined by families of forbidden minors or topological minors. However, these problems have been mainly investigated for vertex deletions and the results about edge deletions are corollaries. Therefore, we do not consider them in this survey. The situation is different if we forbid containment of some graphs as immersions. A graph H is an immersion of G if there is an injective mapping of the vertices of H to the vertices of G and a mapping of the edges of H to pairwise edge-disjoint paths of G such that for every two adjacent vertices u and v of H, the edge uv is mapped to a path of G whose end-vertices are the images of u and v. For a family of graphs F, a graph G is F-immersion free if H is not an immersion of G for every H ∈ F. In [131], Giannopoulou et al. initiated the study of the F-Immersion Deletion problem. Given a (finite) family of graphs F, the task is to decide whether a graph G can be made F-immersion free by at most k edge deletions. Giannopoulou et al. [131] proved that if F consists of connected graphs and at least one graph in the family is planar, then F-Immersion Deletion admits a linear kernel when parameterized by k and can be solved in time 2 O(k) poly(n).
