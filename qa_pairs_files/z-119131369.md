## (s4) The classical relaxed micromorphic model
(p4.0) Our relaxed micromorphic model endows Mindlin-Eringen's representation with the second order dislocation density tensor α = − CurlP instead of the third order tensor ∇P. 2 In the isotropic case the energy of the relaxed micromorphic model reads
