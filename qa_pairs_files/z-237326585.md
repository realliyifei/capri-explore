## (s3) Neurofeedback
(p3.0) Neurofeedback (NF) is an operant conditioning procedure that, by trial and error, teaches participants to volitionally self-regulate specific regions or networks through realtime audio or visual feedback of their brain activation, which can be represented on a PC. For children, this can be gamified in an attractive way. Given that ADHD is typified by poor self-control [75] (Schachar et al., 1993), and enhancing brain-self-control is the target of NF, ADHD is the psychiatric disorder where NF has been most applied, using electrophysiological neurofeedback (EEG-NF).
## (s4) EEG-NF
(p4.0) EEG-NF trains self-regulation of oscillatory or task-related EEG-markers associated with ADHD, such as increased theta and TBR linked to compromised activation; decreased sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) related to impaired state regulation and sleep; and attenuated task-related slow cortical potentials (SCP) such as the CNV correlated with impaired preparation and activation (standard protocols) [76] (Arns et al., 2014).
## (s5) Meta-Analyses of EEG-NF
(p5.0) During the last decade, a large number of meta-analyses were published which scrutinize the clinical efficacy of EEG-NF in ADHD. The first meta-analysis based on ten controlled studies reported large effect sizes in favour of EEG-NF when parents rated the clinical outcome of inattention or for impulsivity measured in tests, as well as noninferiority compared to the gold standard of stimulant medication treatment; it therefore recommended EEG-NF as "efficacious and specific", which means that the treatment has been shown to be statistically superior to credible sham therapy in at least two independent studies [78] (Arns et al., 2009) (for updated, more stringent criteria, see Arns et al., 2020) [79].
## (s6) fMRI-Neurofeedback
(p6.0) Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (fMRI-NF), despite its lower temporal resolution relative to EEG-NF (seconds compared to milliseconds), has superior spatial resolution (millimetre rather than centimetre) and has the advantage that it can target the key cortical and subcortical brain function deficits that have been established in ADHD over the past 25 years of fMRI research [51] (Rubia, 2018). fMRI-NF enables participants to self-regulate the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response of a targeted brain region or network through real-time feedback of their brain activity and has shown some promise in improving clinical symptoms and cognition in psychiatric disorders [109] (Thibault, MacPherson et al., 2018). To date, however, there are only two published fMRI-NF studies in ADHD.

(p6.1) The first fMRI-NF study was a small underpowered randomised controlled trial in seven adults with ADHD who underwent four weekly 1-h fMRI-NF of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), combined with a mental calculation task, while six ADHD patients completed the same task in the scanner but were presented with visual cues indicating level of task difficulty instead of fMRI-NF [110] (Zilverstand et al., 2017). Both groups significantly increased dACC activation over the NF runs, including the transfer runs, and improved in an interference inhibition task. Both groups showed trend-level improvements in ADHD symptoms but did not differ from each other. However, only the neurofeedback group showed significantly stronger performance improvement in sustained attention and working memory tasks after treatment, but not the ADHD group that received no fMRI-NF, indicative of some positive effects of fMRI-NF of dACC on cognition in adults with ADHD [110] (Zilverstand et al., 2017).
## (s7) NIRS Neurofeedback
(p7.0) Only one pilot study so far tested the related neural haemodynamic modulation method of NIRS Neurofeedback (NIRS-NF) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in nine ADHD children, compared to EEG-NF (n = 9) and electromyography-NF (n = 9). Only NIRS-NF resulted in significant improvements in clinical ADHD symptoms and in cognitive inhibition and attention functions after 11 hourly sessions over 4 weeks, which was, however, not superior to EEG-NF or electromyography-NF (Marx et al., 2015) [117].
## (s8) Conclusions from Neurofeedback Studies
(p8.0) In conclusion, EEG-NF has been tested in ADHD for about 45 years, and a large number of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of EEG-NF show consistent small to medium effect sizes for symptom improvements, but still with controversy regarding "probably" blinded raters [32,80]  . Furthermore, the specific effects of EEG-NF and the association between NF self-regulation and clinical improvement are still unclear and need more systematic research. Additionally, future studies should optimize the designs to promote EEG-NF self-regulation and improvement over time, considering increased artefacts and altered reward learning in ADHD [118] (e.g., Aase & Sagvolden, 2005) and further systematically investigate why some participants show low regulation performance.
## (s10) Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
(p10.0) tDCS applies a weak continuous direct electric current to underlying brain regions via scalp electrodes with the electrical current passing between a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode. In general, currents induce plasticity by causing subthreshold polarity-dependent increases (anodal stimulation) or decreases (cathodal stimulation) in membrane potentials that modify spontaneous discharge rates and cortical excitability, thus increasing/decreasing cortical function and synaptic strength [72] (Ashkan et al., 2013). tDCS is much easier to apply and has lower financial costs than TMS. Furthermore, tDCS has the advantage of being less painful than TMS and hence is more suitable for paediatric applications. Side effects are minimal in children (and adults), typically involving transient itching and reddening of the scalp site of stimulation in some participants (Krishnan et al., 2015; Zewdie et al., 2020) [148,149].

(p10.1) Combining cognitive training with tDCS over a cortical area that mediates the cognitive function being trained [134] (Kuo & Nitsche, 2012) has been shown to yield larger and long-lasting functional improvements that modify the impaired system [136]  Unlike with rTMS, the majority of tDCS studies (12 out of 18) (see Table 2) have been conducted in children with ADHD, presumably due to the high tolerability and relatively low side effect profile of tDCS, which would make it a good treatment option if efficacious. The majority of studies used very small session numbers and tested cognitive effects only (see Table 2).

(p10.2) Two double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover studies applied single session stimulation over the DLPFC. In 15 adolescents with ADHD, anode-left/cathode-right tDCS over bilateral DLPFC improved WCST completion time, n-back reaction times and Stroop reaction times and commission errors to incongruent trials but had no effect on n-back accuracy or Go/No-Go task performance [155]  . In 10 ADHD adolescents, anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC improved n-back accuracy and reaction times compared to both sham and cathodal tDCS; anodal and cathodal tDCS also improved WCST performance, but anodal tDCS led to greater improvement; cathodal tDCS also improved No-Go accuracy, potentially via interhemispheric inhibition increasing right prefrontal activation [155]  . This last finding is in line with a single-blind, crossover study in 21 adolescents with ADHD, which found in a subsample of seven participants that, compared to sham, one session of anodal, but not cathodal, tDCS over the right IFC reduced commission errors (trend-level) and reaction time variability in an interference inhibition task (Breitling et al., 2016) [159].

(p10.3) Two single-blind, sham-controlled crossover studies stimulated left DLPFC or right IFC in 20 high school students with ADHD symptoms that were above cut-off on validated ADHD questionnaires. Single session anodal relative to cathodal tDCS over the left DLPFC improved Go accuracy while cathodal tDCS relative to anodal tDCS and sham improved No-Go accuracy in the Go/No-Go task, but there was no change in Stroop task performance [160] (Soltaninejad et al., 2019). Anodal tDCS over the rIFC relative to sham improved Go accuracy, but there were no changes in other Go/No-Go or Stroop task measures (Soltaninejad et al., 2015) [161].
## (s11) Other Stimulation Methods
(p11.0) Only one study has tested random noise stimulation (tRNS) in children with ADHD compared to tDCS and is described above. No studies have been conducted in ADHD with other stimulation methods such as transcranial alternative current stimulation (tACS).

(p11.1) External trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS), also known as transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation (tSNS), is another non-invasive intervention with minimal side effects. Small electrical currents are transmitted transcutaneously via a self-adhesive, supraorbital electrode to excite (trigger action potentials) on the supratrochlear and supraorbital branches of the ophthalmic nerve (V1) located under the skin of the forehead. The supraorbital nerve is a branch of the first trigeminal division. The trigeminal nerve has widespread connections to the brain, in particular the reticular activation system, locus coeruleus, brain stem, thalamic, frontal and cortical areas (Shiozawa et al., 2014) [194] as well as effects on dopamine and noradrenaline, all of which have effects on arousal and attention and have been implicated in ADHD [51] (Rubia, 2018). Two studies have tested the efficacy of eTNS in ADHD. An 8-week, open trial, pilot feasibility study in 21 children with ADHD between 7-14 years showed significant reduction in the investigator-completed ADHD-IV-Rating scale (ADHD-RS), both for the inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive subscales and the parent-completed Conners Global Index and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement as well as a reduction in the parent-completed Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) that measures executive functions in daily life. Patients with ADHD also improved after treatment in scores of depression, but not of anxiety. Furthermore, they tested performance on working memory and attention network tasks and found improvements in reaction times to interference stimuli, indicating positive effects on selective attention and inhibitory control as well as a trend-level improvement in response variability that is considered a measure of arousal and attention. eTNS was well tolerated with few side effects such as eye twitch and headache that were transient (McGough et al., 2015) [195].

(p11.2) The second study from the same group was a blinded, sham-controlled pilot study of eTNS in 62 children with ADHD from 8-12 years old. The investigator-rated ADHD-RS total score was significantly reduced in the active relative to the sham group, as well as the inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive sub-scores and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores. There was furthermore a trend-level differential improvement in the active group for anxiety but not for depression (McGough et al., 2019) [196]. There were no serious adverse events and relatively minor and transient side effects such as headache or fatigue. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) data showed increased power in the active relative to sham group in right frontal midline and inferior frontal regions after compared to before treatment, which furthermore correlated with improvements in the ADHD-RS total score and the ADHD hyperactive-impulsive subscores, suggesting mediation of clinical effects (McGough et al., 2019) [196]. The qEEG findings are partly in line with animal and human imaging studies that show that eTNS stimulates the activation of cortical and subcortical structures such as thalamus, amygdala, locus coeruleus, reticular activation system, prefrontal regions, anterior cingulate and insula [197,198]  ). An activation increase in cortical and subcortical regions in ADHD could be the underlying mechanism of action given consistent evidence from us and others of dysfunction in ADHD in fronto-striato-thalamic neural networks [51] (Rubia, 2018). It is hence plausible that eTNS improves ADHD symptoms and cognition by stimulating the activation of dysfunctional fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical systems. Based on evidence from this small, underpowered pilot study, eTNS is now the only brain stimulation technique that is FDA-approved for ADHD. More evidence is clearly needed to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of eTNS for reducing ADHD symptoms and to define optimal protocols such as repetition frequency, duration of stimulation, etc., similar to the other neurotherapies, as well as to understand its currently unknown underlying mechanisms of action.
