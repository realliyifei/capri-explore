## (s11) The vector field method
(p11.0) In the preceding section, we saw that the ∂-Neumann problem is globally regular in domains that support bounded plurisubharmonic functions with arbitrarily large complex Hessian at the boundary. Now we will discuss a method that applies, for example, to domains admitting defining functions that are plurisubharmonic on the boundary. The method is based on the construction of certain vector fields that almost commute with ∂.

(p11.1) We begin with some general remarks about proving a priori estimates of the form N q u s ≤ C u s and P q u s ≤ C u s in Sobolev spaces for the ∂-Neumann operator and the Bergman projection. Firstly, all the action is near the boundary. This is clear for the Bergman projection on functions, because the mean-value property shows that every Sobolev norm of a holomorphic function on a compact subset of a domain is dominated by a weak norm on the whole domain (for instance, the L 2 norm). The corresponding property holds for the ∂-Neumann operator due to interior elliptic regularity.

(p11.2) Secondly, the conjugate holomorphic derivatives ∂/∂z j are always under control. This is obvious for the case of the Bergman projection P 0 on functions (since holomorphic functions are annihilated by anti-holomorphic derivatives), and the inequality (8) shows that anti-holomorphic derivatives are tame for the ∂-Neumann problem.

(p11.3) Thirdly, differentiation by vector fields whose restrictions to the boundary lie in the complex tangent space is also innocuous. Indeed, integrating by parts turns tangential vector fields of type (1, 0) into vector fields of type (0, 1), which are tame, plus lower-order divergence terms [36, formula (3)].

(p11.4) Thus, we only need to estimate derivatives in the complex normal direction near the boundary. Moreover, since the bar derivatives are free, it will do to estimate either the real part or the imaginary part of the complex normal derivative. That is, we can get by with estimating either the real normal derivative, or a tangential derivative that is transverse to the complex tangent space.
## (s14) Theorem 16.
(p14.0) Let Ω be a bounded domain in C n with class C ∞ boundary and defining function ρ. Suppose there is a vector field X of type (1, 0) with holomorphic coefficients in C ∞ (Ω) that is nowhere tangent to the boundary of Ω and such that | arg Xρ| < π/4k for some positive integer k. Then the Bergman projection on functions maps the Sobolev space W k (Ω) continuously into itself.

(p14.1) In particular, Theorem 16 implies that there are no local obstructions to W k regularity of the Bergman projection. In other words, any sufficiently small piece of C ∞ boundary can be a piece of the boundary of a domain G whose Bergman projection is continuous in W k (G): indeed, G can be taken to be a small perturbation of a ball, and then the radial field satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem.

(p14.2) Theorem 16 also applies when k = 1/2 and the boundary is only Lipschitz smooth. For example, the hypothesis holds for k = 1/2 when the domain is strictly star-shaped. Lempert [114] has exploited this weak regularity property to prove a Hölder regularity theorem for biholomorphic mappings between star-shaped domains with real-analytic boundaries.
## (s15) Proposition 18.
(p15.0) Let Ω be a bounded domain in C n with class C ∞ boundary. For each positive integer k there is a constant C k such that for every square-integrable harmonic function f , and every g ∈ C ∞ (Ω), we have the inequality

(p15.1) The proof of Proposition 18 follows from the observation that for every g ∈ C ∞ (Ω), there is a function g 1 vanishing to high order at the boundary of Ω such that the difference g − g 1 is orthogonal to the harmonic functions. See [23], [31, Appendix B], and [120] for details; the root idea originates with Bell [19] in the context of holomorphic functions. Alternatively, Proposition 18 can be derived from elementary facts about the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace operator [142].

(p15.2) Because the square-integrable harmonic functions are dense in h −∞ (Ω), it follows from (21) that the L 2 pairing extends by continuity to a pairing f, g on h −∞ (Ω)× C ∞ (Ω). In particular, this pairing is well defined and separately continuous on A −∞ cl (Ω) × A ∞ (Ω), where A −∞ cl (Ω) denotes the closure of A 0 (Ω) in A −∞ (Ω). Proposition 19. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C n with class C ∞ boundary. The following statements are equivalent.
