## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Limitations on the availability and timeliness of specialized psychiatric care are a reality across the globe.This mainly has to do with the high prevalence of mental disorders and the shortage of staff in the specialized services of health care systems, especially in small settlements and those geographically remote from large medical and diagnostic centers, not to mention the obstacles involved in seeking the help of specialists because of the pervasive issue of stigmatization [1].

(p0.1) Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is currently among the most challenging problems in pediatric psychiatry, due to its increasing rate of detection in recent decades, poorly defined etiopathogenetic factors, its diagnostic framework, and the therapeutic approaches used, as well as the need for long-term intensive complex treatment and rehabilitation.There are significant issues related to the scarcity of medical and diagnostic resources for families in rural or remote areas with a lower socioeconomic status [1,2].In such cases, ASD is diagnosed with a significant delay [3].
## (s2) RESULTS
(p2.0) Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, there was interest in developing and testing new remote forms of care for patients with ASD to improve access to diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation, as well as to increase the role and involvement of patients' parents in the assessment procedures [11].
## (s6) Synchronous and asynchronous diagnostic approaches
(p6.0) Literature sources outside Russia commonly classify remote diagnostic approaches as synchronous or asynchronous according to the methods used to coordinate the actions of specialists and those receiving care [26,27].Synchronous In a pilot study of the NODA methodology by Nazneen et al. [30], parents easily used the system without prior training to record video materials, 96% of which were found to be clinically relevant for the diagnosis of autism.
## (s8) Clinical (clinical and psychopathological) remote diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
(p8.0) In most of the studies, clinical diagnosis involved the use of some of the standardized assessment tools described above.A review of studies on the use of telemedicine diagnosis of ASD by Stavropoulos et al. [49] obtained data on the equivalence of diagnostic assessments compared with in-person consultations in the range of 80-91%.Six of the ten studies yielded a degree of sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%, while five of the six studies demonstrated specificity values ranging from 68.75% to 100%.Juarez et al. [50] used TMC to diagnose ASD in 62% of 45 children; in 13% of the cases, autism disorders could not be confirmed or excluded remotely.Matthews et al. [51] investigated the acceptability of diagnosing ASD in children, adolescents, and adults as part of a TMC deployed at an autism center in the U.S. Southwest during the COVID-19 pandemic.One hundred and two (84%) patients out of 121 completed the 6-month remote diagnosis program; for 91% (93 out of 102), it was sufficient to use only telemedicine procedures.In-person assessment was required for nine participants; according to surveys of specialists and parents of patients, the telemedicine model for diagnosing ASD was acceptable for most of the respondents.

(p8.1) The relevance of remote assessment of children aged 18-30 months with M-CHAT-R pre-set ASD risk based on video recordings with certain scenarios according to DSM-5 criteria was compared with similar in-person clinical diagnoses [52].Diagnostic agreement was 82.5%, sensitivity was 91.3%, and specificity was 70.6%.The positive predictive value was 80.7%, and the negative predictive value was 85.7%.

(p8.2) In a comparative RCT of remote and in-person consultations for 23 patients with ASD aged 4 to 16 years, the diagnosis and treatment recommendations aligned in 96% of cases [53].There were no differences in the satisfaction of patients and parents, 26% of children preferred the remote format, and 91% of parents preferred Mandatory blocks included observation and assessment of the child's spontaneous behavior, structured situations of interaction with parents, with specialists (attending physician, psychologist, speech therapist, defectologist), and with a remote consultant.Fundamental differences were revealed only in the assessment of the interaction of a child with a remote consultant: the difficulty of assessing eye contact "through the screen," the degree of subjective attitude of the patient to the consultant, the presence/ absence of non-verbal reactions to the background visual, sound, and other stimuli that are not noticeable to the consultant due to fragmented image and sound from the patient and his/her environment (family members, animals, electronic gadgets, and much more).The TMC scenario includes additional clarification questions and actions (tests).
