## (s9) Travel
(p9.0) The last human-related variable was travel, with destination, health while traveling, traveler demographics, protective measures, and household transmission as subcategories (Table 3).International travel [46,48] increased the odds of AMR E. coli, with Asia [15,45,54] and India [15,46] as travel destinations having the highest risks and were found to be the most important variables in this category.Reviews reporting on bowel-related diseases while traveling reported a positive association with odds for AMR E. coli ranging from 1.6 [15] to 31 [45].Antibiotic use while traveling showed a positive association in all reviews, increasing odds from 2.4 [43] to 5 [45].There were no conclusive results around food consumption while traveling on the odds of AMR E. coli, with a vegetarian diet increasing the odds by 1.4 [43], raw vegetable consumption showing mixed results and odds after street food consumption varying from approximately 1.4 to 2.1 [15].Protective measures while traveling were proven ineffective [43,54].International travel, followed by travel to Asia, travel to India, antibiotic use while traveling, vegetarian diet, and street food consumption were identified as important variables.

## (s10) Animal and Environmental Variables
(p10.0) Of the animal-related variables, pets and farming were investigated in reviews for increasing the odds of AMR E. coli amongst community-dwelling populations (Table 4).All reviews reporting on pet owners reported no increased odds of AMR E. coli.No statistical results were reported on farming.Amongst the types of farms, poultry in the Netherlands has been identified as a probable source of genetic AMR E. coli transmission in two reviews identified through whole-genome sequencing [47,49].Looking at the environmental-related variables, swimming in freshwater doubled the risk of AMR E. coli infection in one systematic review [48] (Table 4).No variables were identified as important in both categories.

LLM judge: YES

## (s11) Temporal Relationship Variable and AMR E. coli
(p11.0) Eleven reviews investigated the temporal relation of variables and outcomes of AMR E. coli with antibiotic use and travel as subcategories (Table 5).Reviews showed that resistance after antibiotic use can persist for up to 12 months [15,39,42].All cut-off points before one year were consistently associated with increasing the odds of AMR E. coli varying from 1.4 to 13.2.The risk of AMR E. coli after traveling abroad is highest in the first six weeks but decreases over time [43].Six months [39,51] after antibiotic use was identified as the most important variable for AMR E. coli, followed by one and three months [38,39,51].

## (s15) Data Extraction
(p15.0) Two reviewers (CCHS and ML) independently undertook data extraction and methodological quality assessment.Data were extracted using a predefined data extraction tool based on the JBI Data Extraction Form for Systematic and Research Syntheses [33].The following data (where available) were extracted: review title, author, and year of publication; objectives; type of review; number, type, and region of relevant studies included; population; bacteria investigated; aspect of AMR (emergence, colonization, carriage, infection, or transmission); variables; measures of effect: odds ratio/relative risk and associated 95% confidence intervals; timing between variable exposure and resistance.A third reviewer (LP) independently extracted data from 10% of the included reviews to ensure consistency.All inconsistencies identified during any stage of data extraction were resolved by discussion.

LLM judge: YES

## (s16) Assessment of Methodological Quality
(p16.0) The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers (CCHS and ML) using the "A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews of both randomized and non-randomized studies" (AMSTAR 2) checklist [33,73].Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between reviewers or, in uncertainty regarding statistical data, assessment by a statistician (KR).
