## (s1) Method to predict the hip fracture
(p1.0) Computational analysis and experimental method are found to be the main approaches to predict the hip fracture of the femur bone. During the experiment, most of the tests employed drop test method where the body mass hit the top of pelvis spring. The pelvis mass bypasses the spring and directly impact the soft tissue and femur [1,3,15,18].
## (s5) Stiffness of Pelvis
(p5.0) In order to predict the impact force that hit the femur bone, the estimation of pelvis stiffness is required. This is because , during fall that involves direct impact, impact load is dependent on the effective stiffness of the body to receive the degree of force before it impacts the femur bone [12]. However, some of the previous studies show that during impact, pelvis stiffness only has minimum effect on peak force. From the previous study, a constant value of pelvis spring that act as pelvis compliance are 50kN/m [1,15]. This value also supported by international consensus statement for hip protector testing [15] 3.3. Thickness of trochanteric soft tissue Skin, fascia lata, muscle, fat, and the trochanteric bursa act as soft tissues that cover the greater trochanter [23]. The thickness of trochanteric soft tissue is the overall sum of soft tissue that surrounds the greater trochanter. It influences the distribution and magnitude of the force as it acts as a protector of proximal femur during fall. Based on the result of previous research, the thickness of soft tissue over trochanteric was correlated to the peak force during sideways fall [3,12]. If the thickness of soft tissue is set as a big value, then the ability of energy absorption will increase and dissipate more energy [9,12]. As the thickness of trochanteric soft tissue increase, reduce the body's effective stiffness, consequently reducing the peak force applied to the hip amid an impact. In a variety of experiment, the chosen value of trochanteric soft tissue thickness was 19mm as it is in the range of standard in hip protector testing protocol [15].
