## (s4) National HIV Self-Testing Policies
(p4.0) Recommendations for HTC in the United States, issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2006 [23], aimed to minimize barriers to testing. The guidelines address fear of stigmatization and support the integration of HIV screening into routine healthcare services. Prevention counseling at the time of testing was no longer recommended.
## (s16) Couples
(p16.0) Knowledge of partner HIV status is low, and a significant proportion of transmission occurs within stable serodiscordant couples [65]. Couples testing can increase safer sexual behavior and allow timely uptake of and support for ART. Self-testing could provide confidentiality, autonomy, and convenience, and be a potentially suitable model for couples. However the use of self-testing for "serosorting" presents practical and programmatic problems, if the sensitivity of self-testing is suboptimal and because acute infection may not be detected [66]. There are also potential social issues and challenges for clinical follow-up with partner self-testing. Although there are no data regarding coercion, coercive testing by partners is a potential concern, and rigorous monitoring for adverse events is critical if this approach is to be considered.
