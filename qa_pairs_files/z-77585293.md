## (s1) Detection
(p1.0) All free radicals of biological significance have a life- span of the order of milliseconds or less, and even in a lump of fat actually going rancid the concentration of unpaired electrons at any moment is far too small to be detectable by conventional chemical methods.The only way of catching the species in flagrante is by elec- tron-spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.The tool required is a powerful electromagnet whose magnetic field is deflected by the unbalanced magnetic pole of unpaired electrons.It is, as medical research grants go, expensive, and considerable expertise is required to interpret signals from different free radicals.Also, bio- logical sample preparation is not easy since the free radicals present at any moment have to be trapped by instant freezing. (Free radicals can also be trapped chemically over an extended period by letting them form relatively stable free-radical adducts with certain groups of chemicals [10].Unfortunately the chemical traps available at present are highly toxic.)All these difficulties are gradually being overcome: ESR spec- troscopy has already been successfully applied to the study of cancer of the human uterus [11].But on a wide front biological free-radical research will have to rely for many years yet on indirect evidence.There are several possible approaches.
## (s5) Atheroma
(p5.0) Atheromatous plaques are loaded with lipid peroxides and lipid peroxidation products, a tantalising fact known for many years [41].A more important recent observation has been the free-radical mediated peroxidation of lipids in circulating LDL and the selective scavenging of such complexes by macrophages [42,   43].The factors that determine or influence this per- oxidation [44,45] need to be identified.
