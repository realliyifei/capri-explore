## (s9) Discussion
(p9.0) Our survey shows that most EU/EEA Member States use molecular/genomic typing data for TB surveillance and the transition to WGS is ongoing. Our results also reveal substantial differences in the use and integration of typing data into national TB surveillance systems and identify financial constraints as the main barrier to a broader use, as well as limited experience in cross-border cluster investigation and a lack of respective SOPs. Most countries recognized a public health benefit of molecular typing and an additional benefit of using WGS-based typing.

(p9.1) The implementation of TB molecular surveillance is highly heterogeneous in EU/EEA countries in terms of the kind of typing laboratories, the selection of isolates, the coverage, the analytical approach used, and whether typing data are integrated into TB notification databases. In three countries typing results took ï¿½ 240 days to reach the surveillance units, which may limit the impact on TB control and is in contrast to the increasing speed of typing, e.g., in view of forthcoming genomic typing using direct samples [16].
