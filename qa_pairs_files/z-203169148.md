## (s13) Re-Evaluation of DSN800
(p13.0) As the Layer Strength Diagrams (LSD) are based primarily on the DCP structural number (DSN 800 ) at the prevailing in situ conditions, the plot of the DSN 800 versus traffic was re-assessed for the increased catalogue range and is shown in  pavements as the tyre contact pressures increase. Observations of such roads showed no surface failures due to overstressing, indicating that the upper in situ strengths were higher than tested, probably due to high densities, drier conditions, and visible strengthening of these areas by the prime penetration [42].
