## (s4) Impact of STEAM learning
(p4.0) Bagiati and Evangelou (2015) focus on developing the STEM curriculum in early education with an emphasis on engineering. Their study presents the teacher's experience when undertaking the task of becoming accustomed to new content and using the curriculum in university-based lab school classes in the US. More specifically, the article explains and analyses the collaboration between teachers and curriculum developers. Technical education in previous years was an academic discipline that grew out of the need to understand and improve the way engineers were formally educated. Beliefs about early experience as a determinant of later experience have long been the basis of educational planning (Buchmann & Schwille, 1983). Therefore, identifying age and the exact way in which early childhood education is part of technical education is very important in the current climate.
