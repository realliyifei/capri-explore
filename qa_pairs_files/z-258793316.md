## (s5) Colostrum Analysis
(p5.0) The bovine colostrum quality can be estimated by the colostrometer, a device that measures the specific gravity related to the total gamma-globulin concentration and enables an estimation of quantity on the basis of a statistical correlation. In the buffalo, a nonsignificant correlation between the specific gravity and total gamma-globulin was seen [72]. The reason lies in the different colostrum composition between cow and buffalo colostrum, with higher concentrations of fat and proteins in buffalo colostrum that may affect the colostrometer readings. Within all parameters evaluated as possible markers for buffalo colostral quality, the enzyme GGT appeared with the highest correlation observed between its activity and the concentrations of gamma globulins [73,74].

(p5.1) The enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase is a cell membrane-bound enzyme located on the outer surface of cell membranes. It transports and uses glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide with antioxidant action, as a source of amino acids for cell metabolism [74]. Results of Pero et al. [74], showed that glutathione is secreted in buffalo colostrum and that the enzyme GGT uses it as a substrate for its activity.

(p5.2) Younger buffalo cows have lower immunoglobulin content in the colostrum than older ones [75]. This is related to the increased antigenic exposure in older cows, so that a greater array of antibodies is transferred from bovine serum to the colostrum. Moreover, the mammary gland also plays an important role, and, since its development may not be complete in the younger cows, the transport of IgG may be reduced [40] According to Pritchett et al. [76], animals at the second lactation showed significantly lower IgG concentration than those at the third lactation. In general, the number of bio-active components in colostrum decreases after 6/12 h from birth. In addition to its immunological importance, the colostrum has also been reported to possess anti-inflammatory [77], anticancer [78], antimicrobial [79], and nutraceutical [80] properties.

(p5.3) Compared to bovine colostrum, buffalo colostrum shows higher concentrations of lactose, ash, total solids, fat, vitamin E, phosphorus, and IGF-1, and lower of vitamin A, Mg, K, Na, Zn, and lactoferrin [36]. Colostrum contains other bioactive compounds, such as lactoferrin (LF), lysozyme, and growth factors [39], that will be discussed later.
## (s6) Passive Immunity Transfer (PIT)
(p6.0) The calf must acquire passive immunity via colostrum [47]. The timing of colostrum intake, the method, and volume of colostrum administration, the presence of the mother, as well as respiratory acidosis of the newly born, are linked to its absorption in calves [93]. Colostrum antibodies can protect the calf for up to six weeks. During this period, in the environment, the animal contacts infectious agents, which gradually stimulate the development of its immune system [28]. If the calf does not receive colostral immunoglobulins, is highly exposed to diseases, and this can even cause a high mortality rate of calves on the farm [94,95]. The onset of immunocompetence (active immunity) occurs after three weeks of age, when the passive coverage of the antibodies taken up via colostrum begins to decrease [96].
## (s8) Colostrum Storage
(p8.0) Colostrum production rapidly ceases during parturition, and its composition drastically varies with time, making it necessary to collect it from suitable donors as soon as possible [115]. Pathogenic bacteria and pH are significantly altered during the storage and changes are more rapid when colostrum is stored at temperatures > 4 • C [119]. There are studies that sustain that colostrum can be kept in plastic containers at room temperature, but the shelf life is just three days due to deterioration and fermentation [41,120]. It has also been studied that the viability of cellular components and immunoglobulins, at a temperature of 4 • C, keeps them stable for up to a week [121].
## (s9) Benefits of Colostrum: Infection Prevention
(p9.0) Both buffalo and bovine calves are extremely vulnerable; thus, they are exposed to a high risk of infection. Guidelines recommend feeding 10 percent of the calf's weight of colostrum to the bovine calf [46].
