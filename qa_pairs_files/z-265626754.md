## (s1) Flooding and the Effect on Nutrients
(p1.0) Overwet environments create stress for plants by significantly slowing gaseous diffusion and preventing aerobic mechanisms that are vital for plant health [16].'Flooding' is a general term for excessively wet conditions, and care must be taken to use consistent terminology for the type of excessive water conditions studied in an experiment.Four types of flooding have been suggested for use in flooding and low O 2 stress research [20]: (1) "waterlogging", in which only the root-zone is flooded; (2) "partial waterlogging", in which the root-zone is partially flooded; (3) "submergence", in which the entire plant (root and shoot) is under water; and (4) "partial submergence", in which the entire root system and only part of the above-ground organs are under water.
## (s4) Effect of Ascophyllum nodosum on Nutrient Acquisition
(p4.0) ANE applications have been found to increase nutrient availability and uptake, and nutrients from ANEs can be readily absorbed by leaves through stomata and cuticle hydrophilic pores [31,36].This foliar absorption would be particularly useful when plants are waterlogged and nutrient acquisition through the roots is inhibited.Several studies report an increase in nutrients following ANE application, although the effect varies for different crops.In salinity-stressed tomato, A. nodosum increased the content of N, P, K, Ca, S, Mg, Zn, Mn, and Fe [37]; in olive, only K, Fe, and Cu increased [38]; in broccoli, there were increases in dry matter, yield, and content of P, K, Ca, and Mg [39].Evidence suggests that crops have a very individual response to biostimulant applications, and the biostimulant effect will depend on crop species as well as many other factors.These

(p5.0) ANE applications have been found to increase nutrient availability and uptake, and nutrients from ANEs can be readily absorbed by leaves through stomata and cuticle hydrophilic pores [31,36].This foliar absorption would be particularly useful when plants are waterlogged and nutrient acquisition through the roots is inhibited.Several studies report an increase in nutrients following ANE application, although the effect varies for different crops.In salinity-stressed tomato, A. nodosum increased the content of N, P, K, Ca, S, Mg, Zn, Mn, and Fe [37]; in olive, only K, Fe, and Cu increased [38]; in broccoli, there were increases in dry matter, yield, and content of P, K, Ca, and Mg [39].Evidence suggests that crops have a very individual response to biostimulant applications, and the biostimulant effect will depend on crop species as well as many other factors.These nutrient increases could be beneficial for cabbage and other crops experiencing longer waterlogged conditions to allow for some nutrient acquisition to still occur, even while nutrient uptake by the roots is completely inhibited.

(p5.1) Mancuso et al. [40] believe entry through the stomata to be the preferential route for K + and Ca 2+ ion uptake and additionally suggest that chelating compounds in seaweed (e.g., mannitol) are responsible for increasing nutrient availability and absorption.Other studies suggest that the increased nutrient availability and uptake are likely due to changes in the regulation of genes involved in nutrient acquisition [31].Through their microarray analysis, Jannin et al. [41] identified approximately 1000 genes whose expression was significantly affected by the application of seaweed extract to Brassica napus.The most affected pathways involved carbon and photosynthesis, cell metabolism, and N and S responses to stress.Specifically, they found the enhancement of genes that encode proteins involved in the uptake and assimilation of N and S.
## (s13) Mineral Biostimulants (Nano-CaCO 3 )
(p13.0) Some biostimulants, e.g., Eco Green, are based on mineral nanoparticles such as nano-CaCO 3 .Nanotechnology, a form of precision agriculture, is becoming progressively more prevalent in crop production due to its ability to enhance crop productivity [103].Plant products based on nanomaterials have several advantages over conventional products, including increased efficacy, reduced input requirements, and lower environmental toxicity [104].When applied as an ameliorative agent against plant stress, the success of nano-products is due to their small size, which improves their contact with leaf pores and facilitates translocation in plant vessels [105].Nano CaCO 3 has been applied as a foliar spray, dissolved in hydroponic solution, or applied as fertigation [106][107][108].Foliar applications are beneficial to plants as they work rapidly and independently of soil conditions [106].This is important if there is a need to apply biostimulants during waterlogged conditions, when soil is saturated and soil applications become diluted.In hydroponic conditions, nano-CaCO 3 application to the roots of wheat seedlings showed an increase in SOD and APX activities (54% and 58%, respectively) and significantly enhanced photosynthesisrelated physiological indicators [107], demonstrating that this type of application may also be beneficial if applied once waterlogged conditions have receded.
