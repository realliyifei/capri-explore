## (s10) Higher-order births
(p10.0) With the onset of extremely late  rst births among the highly educated during the 1950-2016 period, second and subsequent births are likely to be foregone (Beaujouan 2020).Apart from timing, the likelihood of third births is dependent in part on the selection of individuals by their level of education into higher order births, their characteristics, and contextual factors -although they might not be as sensitive to contextual factors as  rst births (Wood et al. 2014).For instance, CEE (Central and Eastern European) countries display negative educational gradients for the likelihood of third births despite strong pro-natalist policies, and Norway, France, and Belgium display a U-shaped relationship between educational attainment and the likelihood of third births among women.
