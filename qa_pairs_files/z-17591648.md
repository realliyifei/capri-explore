## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Healthy, adult gait is often characterized as a bilateral symmetrical behavior, and such symmetry is advantageous because it increases energetic efficiency [1].This symmetrical pattern is not found in the initial stages of walking, rather young infants move in an asymmetric fashion, eventually acquiring adult like patterns around 5 years of age [2].The symmetrical pattern in older children and adults is often broken, however, due to pathology, disease, or injury.While there has been a large body of research examining healthy gait and various forms of pathological or injured gait, at present there are few tools designed to quantitatively measure deviations from symmetrical gait and to track changes in deviations over time.The goal of the present paper is to outline a number of procedures developed by our research group to quantitatively assess deviations from symmetry and to track changes in symmetry over time.We begin with a brief review of past work examining symmetry in human gait, and then provide an overview of the tools that we have been developing.In this later section, we review examples from our research to highlight the use of these tools.
## (s5) Regions of Deviation Analysis (ROD)
(p5.0) We developed a technique that we refer to as Regions of Deviation (ROD) analysis to provide quantitative metrics to describe and compare motion patterns in gait [51].This approach can be used to evaluate deviations in symmetry between bilateral joints or deviation of an individual joint relative to healthy normative behavior.ROD analysis consists of two measures: Symmetry Regions of deviation (SROD) and Individual Regions of Deviation (IROD).

(p5.1) SROD analysis can be used to quantify deviations from symmetry and to determine when bilateral joint angle pairs demonstrate asymmetric behavior.In the case of an injury, SROD values are calculated from the angular difference between the affected and unaffected sides of a given joint computed over one gait cycle.These bilateral joint angle differences are then averaged over the total number of cycles for an experimental trial.The averaged difference is then compared to normative joint motion.Figure 1 provides an example of this approach using data that we collected from ten healthy young male subjects with or without a brace on the right knee to simulate an injury that would severely restrict the knee's range of motion.

(p5.2) To perform the SROD procedure for a given test condition (i), e.g., healthy or injured, the bilateral angular difference between the affected (right) and unaffected (left) sides of a given joint (j) was first computed over one gait cycle, , ,

(p5.3) values for the affected side, suggesting asymmetry in movement.In our initial study using bracing [51], this calculation was repeated for test data collected while the subject walked on a treadmill during three-minute trials of normal (unbraced) walking or walking with a brace on the right ankle or knee (i.e., 100+ gait cycles per test condition).These bilateral joint angle differences were then averaged over the total number of cycles (
## (s8) IROD value
(p8.0) Preliminary work with this technique has allowed quantification of deviations in bilateral joint pair symmetry and individual joints by examining peak amplitude and timing differences in angular joint kinematic time series data when comparing unbraced and knee or ankle braced data [51].While traditional measures (e.g., maximum range of motion) grossly detected asymmetries due to bracing, this analysis identified significant regions of asymmetry.That is, this method can identify where in the gait cycle the movement pattern deviates from a symmetric one.

(p8.1) The original ROD methodology allowed quantification of deviations in bilateral joint pair symmetry and individual joints by examining peak amplitude and timing differences in angular joint kinematic time series data.We recently refined this approach to use sequential t-tests to quantify locations in the gait cycle that are significantly different [54].By examining whether observed symmetry differences due to impairment were significantly different from normal throughout the entire gait cycle, it is possible to get a sense of the true regions for which the movement patterns deviated from normal.
