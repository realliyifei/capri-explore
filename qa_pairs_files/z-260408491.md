## (s1) RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
(p1.0) Results from an extensive review of risk documentation modeling and assessment in building projects are presented in this study based on the analysis of basic studies starting with the 1990s, in which the most prominent studies are (Mustafa and Al-Bahar, 1991; Williams, 1995;Ward, 1999) and other studies extending to the twentieth century such as (Tah and Carr, 2000;Xu and Tiong, 2001;Dikmen and Birgonul, 2006; Nieto-Morote and Ruz-Vila, 2011) and many other important studies. The dangers of building projects, such as highways, roads, and building construction, are the primary subject of this research. The focus is on academic papers written in English that have been through a strict peer review process. Numerous documents on building risk assessment have been published over the past two decades. First, use keyword searches to find relevant research papers from different online sources and collect them. Some sources are the Emerald database, such as (Science Direct, Taylor & Francis, Springer Link, Google Scholar, ProQuest, ABI/Inform; IEEE; Ingenta Connect; and Web of Science). Various phrases like "risks in construction projects," "risk quantification in construction projects," "risk analysis in construction projects," "risk quantification and analysis in construction," and "modeling project risks" are appropriate for this function. The thoroughness of the search was verified using several different permutations, however. The study examined articles published in databases over the past 20 years to determine how risk modeling and assessment have changed. More than 208 scholarly articles emerged from the investigation. In the end, though, only 68 papers were significantly more critical after a long refining process. Reading these publications allowed us to extract crucial data from them. The authors' names, the year the paper was published, the study's title, the journal's name, native country, research and analyzing data methods, manufacturing, the intention, and the aims are all included. The presented publications in Table 1 cover two decades of project risk modeling and evaluation. Later, paper analyses and literature review results will be discussed to elicit themes and patterns. Finally, the study concludes with a summary of the most important findings and a discussion of their significance.
## (s4) Time from 2000 -2004
(p4.0) Efforts have ramped up to better analyze and assess construction risk since 2000, with tools becoming more complex thanks to the availability of high-capacity personal computers. Therefore, decision support systems frequently help with risk assessment (DSSs). As (Chapman and Ward, 2000) claimed, oversimplifying risk probability and impact estimations lead to unneeded uncertainty when using the Probability-Impact grid to evaluate risk. They advocated for a "minimalist" strategy that uses ranges rather than single scores to identify hazards and analyze their likelihood and implications. While the established technique did offer an estimate of the amount of risk associated with the project, the assessment methodology was significantly simplified. The project's risk level was established as the weighted aggregate of the individual evaluations, which were made using a specified scale from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no danger, and 100 indicates the most significant risk. With the help of FST, (Tah and Carr, 2000) determined the likelihood of adverse events, their severity, and the relationships between the various risks. The authors attempted to address this shortcoming of the fuzzy averaging method by proposing a new aggregation formula based on the maximum risk estimate, Emax, and a modification factor (ξ), as shown in the following example: E = ξ * Emax. Although this aggregation rule is an essential substitute for the averaging one, it may not always be the best option. For example, if there is more than one significant risk factor, it may be challenging to use. The researchers agreed that their approach required more accuracy. (Baccarini and Archer, 2001) utilized the Department of Contract and Management Services in Western Australia's system for ranking projects according to their risk levels. Individual risk scores are calculated by averaging and multiplying the risk's likelihood of occurrence score with its influence on the project's cost, duration, and quality. Such a summing-up rule is overly simplistic and may not produce accurate evaluations. The model presented by (Ben-David and Raz, 2001) finds the optimal mix of risk-mitigation strategies while simultaneously minimizing overall costs. The approach helps estimate some hazards associated with a project but oversimplifies the scope of such risks. Using AHP and decision trees, (Dey, 2001) presented a DSS for early-stage construction risk management. As a result, the method does not attempt to measure the magnitude of any risk but instead suggests the least expensive possible course of action in response to each given risk. In addition, it did not provide any method for adding up the various risks' effects. Once again, PT-based techniques emerged in stochastic programming (Xu and Tiong, 2001). The FST was used by (Tah and Carr, 2001) to generate project risk ratings. They did not suggest a mechanism for merging the determined evaluations of risk impact on project duration, cost, quality, and safety. It might appear that the scholarly community has exhausted every theory and method for evaluating risk. Additionally, researchers have always found that aggregating individual hazards is crucial. They have utilized various methods to arrive at a risk level that reflects the project overall. (Baloi and Price, 2003) provided a crucial overview of the many techniques and resources at our disposal when assessing risks. They concluded that FST was a practical option for the construction sector. Researchers were concerned about the meaning of "risk" and its connection to the concept of risk. Instead of "risk management," (Ward and Chapman, 2003) recommend "uncertainty management" for projects. They identified risk as anything that might endanger people or things. (Choi et al., 2004), who used FST to analyze risk in underground building projects, also addressed the varying types of risk involved.
