## (s1) Grain Boundary Wetting Phase Transitions
(p1.0) Usually, HEAs contain at least five different components, and respective equilibrium phase diagrams should be constructed in at least 5 dimensions.Nevertheless, we can discuss the most important features of GB wetting phase transitions [45] using the simplest two-dimensional scheme for binary alloys.Such a schematic phase diagram for two components in the system is shown in Figure 2. Bold lines for the bulk phase transitions Usually, HEAs contain at least five different components, and respective equilibrium phase diagrams should be constructed in at least 5 dimensions.Nevertheless, we can discuss the most important features of GB wetting phase transitions [45] using the simplest two-dimensional scheme for binary alloys.Such a schematic phase diagram for two components in the system is shown in Figure 2. Bold lines for the bulk phase transitions are liquidus, solidus, solvus and eutectic line.Thin lines at Twmin and Twmax show the tie-lines of the GB transitions.During the cooling, the alloy is first in the liquid area L and then crosses the liquidus line, entering the L + α two-phase area.In this L+α, the liquid phase, L, is in equilibrium with the solid phase, α (strictly speaking it is the solid solution based on component A).By decreasing temperature, the portion of melt L decreases and that of solid solution α increases.The composition of solidifying α-phase follows the solidus line.It means that the first portions of α-phase are free from component B, and afterwards the concentration of B increases.If the concentration of B is low (see lines a,b,c,d in Figure 3e), the solidification finishes at the solidus line.As a result the solid alloy contains only α-phase, but the last solidified portions are enriched by the component B. In multicomponent HEAs, the GB wetting transitions are not so simple.For example, if HEA contains six components it needs for its description the phase diagram in six dimensions.In such a case an alloy starting to solidify by cooling from the melt, L, may intersect several multiphase areas (and not just one two-phase region, α + L) until it becomes completely solid, α.In such multiphase regions more than one liquid and one solid phase(s) may coexist.The polycrystal in the two-phase region, α + L, contains the GBs as well as boundaries between the α-phase and the melt L called interphase boundaries (IBs).Let us consider now the triple junctions (TJs) between two IBs and GB.Here GB contacts with the melt (see schemes on the left-hand side of Figure 2).Let us suppose that the GB energy, σGB, is less than the energy of the two solid/liquid IBs, 2σSL (see lower scheme in Figure 2).The GB and IBs form in this case the contact angle, θ > 0, at this TJ, and the GB wetting is called partial (or incomplete).If σGB In multicomponent HEAs, the GB wetting transitions are not so simple.For example, if HEA contains six components it needs for its description the phase diagram in six dimensions.In such a case an alloy starting to solidify by cooling from the melt, L, may intersect several multiphase areas (and not just one two-phase region, α + L) until it becomes completely solid, α.In such multiphase regions more than one liquid and one solid phase(s) may coexist.The polycrystal in the two-phase region, α + L, contains the GBs as well as boundaries between the α-phase and the melt L called interphase boundaries (IBs).Let us consider now the triple junctions (TJs) between two IBs and GB.Here GB contacts with the melt (see schemes on the left-hand side of Figure 2).
## (s2) GB Wetting in the HEA Coatings Containing One Phase
(p2.0) In Ref. [47] the FeNiCoCrMo x (with atomic ratio x = 0, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25) HEA coatings were prepared by laser cladding on 316 stainless steel substrate.The coatings were named, respectively, Mo0, Mo0.15, Mo0.20 and Mo0.25.The preplaced powder system was used.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that with increasing concentrations of Mo the high entropy alloy coatings still have a single-phase face-centered cubic (fcc) structure.The XRD patterns contain no diffraction peaks except for (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) fcc solid solution diffraction peaks.They only shift a little due to the change of lattice period.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of these coatings are shown in Figure 3a-d.The composition was locally measured by the energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS).Figure 3e shows the scheme with the binary phase diagram for the explanation of the respective GB wetting processes.The dotted red arrows show the cooling trajectories corresponding to the micrographs (a)-(d).As mentioned above, if the trajectories (a)-(d) do not intersect the line of eutectic transformation, the Mo-poor dendrites solidify first, and last enriched portions of the melt between dendrites solidify at the end.We can see that dendrite grains do not grow together during the solidification, they do not form GBs "dendrite/dendrite".Thus, these GBs were fully wetted by the Mo-enriched melt.Nevertheless, after solidification the FeNiCoCrMo x HEAs contained one fcc phase, but with different composition in bulk and in GBs.

(p2.1) The comparable behavior of GB wetting took place also in the CoCr 2 FeNiMo x HEA with changing Mo content x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 [58].In Ref. [59] the AlCoCrFeNiSi x HEAs with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 have been deposited by laser cladding.The coatings always contain the single fcc phase, as in Ref. [47].However, the transition between complete and incomplete GB wetting took place with increasing Si content [59].This means that the T wmin and T wmax tie-lines (see scheme in Figure 3e) are positioned higher, and with increase of Si content the solidification trajectories come to the area below T wmin before the solidification is finished.One can find another pure example of the complete wetting process for the fcc/fcc GBs by the final portions of solidifying melt in the CrFeNiNbTi alloy [60].The small amount of equiaxial Fe 2 Ti precipitates does not disturb the perfect picture of a GB wetting.In Ref. [61] the CoCrCu 1-x FeNi x HEA contains only one fcc phase at all studied x values (namely, x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5).However, the wetting conditions change, similar to [59].Namely, at x = 0 almost all grain boundaries in the face-centred cubic matrix phase are completely wetted by the Cu-rich fcc phase.When x increases, the portion of partially wetted GBs increases as well.
## (s4) GB Wetting in the HEA Coatings in Case of Transition from One Phase to Two Phases
(p4.0) We will next discuss the example of GB wetting in HEAs where the transition from one phase to two phases takes place with changing composition.In Ref [64], the HEA coatings Al x CrFeCoNiCu (x: molar ratio, x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, or 2.0) were prepared via laser cladding with the preplaced powder system.It can be seen that the Al concentration varied across a broad interval for 11 different concentration values.The XRD patterns (Figure 6a) show that the samples with x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 contain only one fcc phase.Their microstructure (Figure 7a-f) is very similar to that shown in Figure 3.The composition has been measured in the points DR 1,2,3 and 4 inside the dendrites and in the points IR 1, 2, 3 and 4 between the dendrites.The coating in all IR points was strongly enriched by copper and in the IR 2, 3 and 4 it was enriched by Al.In other words, at the last stage of crystallization the solid grains were completely isolated from their neighbors by the Cu-and Al-rich melt before solidification.It means that in the schematic phase diagram (Figure 8g) the samples followed the trajectories (0, 0.1, 0.3) shown by red arrows.In other words, during solidification in the α+L area the samples were above the T wmax tie-line and all fcc/fcc GBs were fully wetted by the liquid phase.In the sample with x = 0.5, a small amount of bcc1 phase appeared (Figure 6a), but the microstructure of this sample (Figure 7d) was still very similar to the samples with x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 (Figure 7a-c).It means that the solidification followed the trajectory "0.5" in the scheme Figure 8g.

(p4.1) one phase to two phases takes place with changing composition.In Ref [64], the HEA coatings AlxCrFeCoNiCu (x: molar ratio, x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, or 2.0) were prepared via laser cladding with the preplaced powder system.It can be seen that the Al concentration varied across a broad interval for 11 different concentration values.The XRD patterns (Figure 6a) show that the samples with x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 contain only one fcc phase.Their microstructure (Figure 7a-f) is very similar to that shown in Figure 3.The composition has been measured in the points DR 1,2,3 and 4 inside the dendrites and in the points IR 1, 2, 3 and 4 between the dendrites.The coating in all IR points was strongly enriched by copper and in the IR 2, 3 and 4 it was enriched by Al.In other words, at the last stage of crystallization the solid grains were completely isolated from their neighbors by the Cu-and Al-rich melt before solidification.It means that in the schematic phase diagram (Figure 8g) the samples followed the trajectories (0, 0.1, 0.3) shown by red arrows.In other words, during solidification in the α+L area the samples were above the Twmax tie-line and all fcc/fcc GBs were fully wetted by the liquid phase.In the sample with x = 0.5, a small amount of bcc1 phase appeared (Figure 6a), but the microstructure of this sample (Figure 7d) was still very similar to the samples with x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 (Figure 7a-c).It means that the solidification followed the trajectory "0.5" in the scheme Figure 8g.coatings AlxCrFeCoNiCu (x: molar ratio, x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, or 2.0) were prepared via laser cladding with the preplaced powder system.It can be seen that the Al concentration varied across a broad interval for 11 different concentration values.The XRD patterns (Figure 6a) show that the samples with x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 contain only one fcc phase.Their microstructure (Figure 7a-f) is very similar to that shown in Figure 3.The composition has been measured in the points DR 1,2,3 and 4 inside the dendrites and in the points IR 1, 2, 3 and 4 between the dendrites.The coating in all IR points was strongly enriched by copper and in the IR 2, 3 and 4 it was enriched by Al.In other words, at the last stage of crystallization the solid grains were completely isolated from their neighbors by the Cu-and Al-rich melt before solidification.It means that in the schematic phase diagram (Figure 8g) the samples followed the trajectories (0, 0.1, 0.3) shown by red arrows.In other words, during solidification in the α+L area the samples were above the Twmax tie-line and all fcc/fcc GBs were fully wetted by the liquid phase.In the sample with x = 0.5, a small amount of bcc1 phase appeared (Figure 6a), but the microstructure of this sample (Figure 7d) was still very similar to the samples with x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 (Figure 7a-c).It means that the solidification followed the trajectory "0.5" in the scheme Figure 8g.The samples x = 0.7, 0.8, 1.0 contained not only the fcc phase but two additional bcc1 and bcc2 phases (Figure 6b).The respective microstructures are shown in Figure 8.They are quite different from those in Figure 7 and have some similarity with microstructures shown in Figure 4 In other words, the matrix grains have fcc structure, and the last portions of the melt are decomposed in the fcc + (bcc1,bcc2) mixture.These portions of Al-rich melt also wetted the fcc/fcc GBs, but the wetting was not as perfect as in Figure 7a-c for x = 0, 0.1, 0.3.Some grains of the matrix fcc phase formed the GBs with each other and, therefore, the GB wetting was only partial for them.This can be schematically explained with trajectories "0.7, 0.8, 1.0" in Figure 8g.Namely, just before the eutectic line, the samples were below the T wmax tie-line (and maybe even below the T wmin tie-line) and, therefore, not all GBs were completely wetted.Moreover, we can see that amount of completely wetted GBs decreases when the Al concentration increases from 0.7 to 1.0.Most probably, this is because the schematic binary phase diagram in Figure 8g is too simple for the sixcomponent Al x CrFeCoNiCu HEAs.It does not take into account that indeed not two α+β but three solid phases fcc + (bcc1,bcc2) were present in the studied samples.

(p4.2) , x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 23  The samples x = 0.7, 0.8, 1.0 contained not only the fcc phase but two additional bcc1 and bcc2 phases (Figure 6b).The respective microstructures are shown in Figure 8.They are quite different from those in Figure 7 and have some similarity with microstructures shown in Figure 4.In other words, the matrix grains have fcc structure, and the last portions of the melt are decomposed in the fcc + (bcc1,bcc2) mixture.These portions of Al-rich melt also wetted the fcc/fcc GBs, but the wetting was not as perfect as in Figure 7a-c for x = 0, 0.1, 0.3.Some grains of the matrix fcc phase formed the GBs with each other and, therefore, the GB wetting was only partial for them.This can be schematically explained with trajectories "0.7, 0.8, 1.0" in Figure 8g.Namely, just before the eutectic line, the samples were below the Twmax tie-line (and maybe even below the Twmin tie-line) and, therefore, not all GBs were completely wetted.Moreover, we can see that amount of completely wetted GBs decreases when the Al concentration increases from 0.7 to 1.0.Most probably, this is because the schematic binary phase diagram in Figure 8g is too simple for the six-component AlxCrFeCoNiCu HEAs.It does not take into account that indeed not two α+β but three solid phases fcc + (bcc1,bcc2) were present in the studied samples.
## (s5) Influence of Laser Scanning Speed on GB Wetting in HEA Coatings
(p5.0) This section will look at how laser scanning speed can affect the GB wetting in HEA coatings.In Ref. [70] 70 HEAs contain the major phase with bcc lattice and minor phase with fcc lattice.Figure 9 shows the SEM micrographs of these coatings deposited with different laser scanning speeds.At low speeds of 7 and 9 mm/s, the 5-7 µm thick layers of fcc phase (appears bright in SEM micrographs) completely wetted the GBs between bcc matrix grains (appear dark).Moreover, the slow formation rate of HEA coatings allowed the growth of Widmanstätten plates of fcc phase from the GBs into the bulk of the bcc matrix.Only a few fcc nanoparticles precipitated in the bulk.At 11 mm/s the Widmanstätten plates disappeared.Only a thick "coat" of fcc precipitates covers the bcc/bcc GBs.At speeds of 13, 15, 17 and 19 mm/s, the portion of nanoprecipitates increased and the thickness of fcc GB layers continuously increased.Nevertheless, all bcc/bcc GBs were still completely wetted by the thin fcc layers.However, at the highest studied speed of 21 mm/s, only about one half of bcc/bcc GBs were completely wetted, while the other half contained separated particles of fcc-phase.These GBs were partially wetted.Thus, the increasing speed of the laser scanning is equivalent to the shift of T wmin value to higher temperatures (see the dotted red arrow in the scheme at Figure 4c) and not all bcc/bcc GBs become completely wetted by the last portion of the melt before eutectic crystallization.

(p5.1) mm. Laser cladding was carried out by IPG YLS-5000 fiber system with a protective gas and laser power 3000 W. The laser scanning speeds were 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 mm/s for eight HEA coatings named as V7, V9, V11, V13, V15, V17, V19 and V21.The XRD patterns show that the as-deposited Al16.80Co20.74Cr20.49Fe21.28Ni20.70HEAs contain the major phase with bcc lattice and minor phase with fcc lattice.Figure 9 shows the SEM micrographs of these coatings deposited with different laser scanning speeds.At low speeds of 7 and 9 mm/s, the 5-7 μm thick layers of fcc phase (appears bright in SEM micrographs) completely wetted the GBs between bcc matrix grains (appear dark).Moreover, the slow formation rate of HEA coatings allowed the growth of Widmanstätten plates of fcc phase from the GBs into the bulk of the bcc matrix.Only a few fcc nanoparticles precipitated in the bulk.At 11 mm/s the Widmanstätten plates disappeared.Only a thick "coat" of fcc precipitates covers the bcc/bcc GBs.At speeds of 13, 15, 17 and 19 mm/s, the portion of nanoprecipitates increased and the thickness of fcc GB layers continuously increased.Nevertheless, all bcc/bcc GBs were still completely wetted by the thin fcc layers.However, at the highest studied speed of 21 mm/s, only about one half of bcc/bcc GBs were completely wetted, while the other half contained separated particles of fcc-phase.These GBs were partially wetted.Thus, the increasing speed of the laser scanning is equivalent to the shift of Twmin value to higher temperatures (see the dotted red arrow in the scheme at Figure 4c) and not all bcc/bcc GBs become completely wetted by the last portion of the melt before eutectic crystallization.
