## (s10) MANAGEMENT [4]
(p10.0) Assessment of predisposing factor plays a crucial role in the management of candidal infection. Mostly the infection is simply and effectively treated with topical application of antifungal ointments. However in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis with immunosuppression, topical agents may not be effective. In such instances systemic administration of medications is required [Tables 3 and 4]. [4] CONCLUSION Yeast-free diets, or people, are both impossible to come by. They can only be totally avoided in the diet by eating solely fresh dairy, meat, fish and peeled fresh fruits and vegetables. From a practical standpoint, this is neither feasible nor necessary. Total elimination of yeast from the body is also neither feasible nor desirable, considering that yeasts are beneficial to the body
