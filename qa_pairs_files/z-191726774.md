## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Carbon emission is considered one of the main contributors to global warming.As industries are assumed to be one of the major contributors to these emissions, their processes, and supply chains (SC) are increasingly subjected to various carbon policies [1].
## (s4) Drivers and Actors
(p4.0) The review shows that cap-and-trade and carbon tax policies are the most important drivers followed by carbon cap schemes.For example, the carbon tax policy is adopted in Japan, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and the cap-and-trade policy is adopted in Europe and China.Economists and policymakers favor the carbon tax as it requires lesser administration in its implementation [13,32].The cap-and-trade policy offers the opportunity for firms to share the benefits of low-emission activities by carbon trading [33].The review shows that most of the research focuses on the activities associated with the forward flows in a supply system, only a few studies have explored the decisions for CLSCs.

## (s13) Carbon Cap Policy
(p13.0) The carbon cap policy can be applied with two principles, that is, grandfathering and benchmarking.Ji, Zhang and Yang [59] mention that the grandfathering principle uses the trend of emissions, but benchmarking focuses on the output based on a common benchmark in the sector.Their analysis shows that the adoption of benchmarked processes can lead to the production of low carbon products.However, the carbon cap policy does not always yield a low cost solution [101] as the carbon cap level is the most important factor for the industries [33].Therefore, the knowledge on a range of carbon cap becomes important for policymakers to design different levels of carbon cap [45].Between carbon tax and carbon cap policies, the latter is generally less flexible in terms of emission reduction cost [33] but it usually leads to a lower total cost [69,76].
