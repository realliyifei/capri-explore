## (s1) Types of bacteria in the intestinal microbiota
(p1.0) The gut microbiota includes beneficial bacteria, conditional pathogenic bacteria, and pathogenic bacteria. In healthy people, beneficial bacteria are dominant in the intestinal tract, where they help to maintain intestinal homeostasis and immune regulation. An increase in the proportion of harmful bacteria in the gut, or, an imbalance between beneficial and harmful bacteria, results in disease. The metabolism of these organisms under homeostasis produces numerous substances that are beneficial for the host, whereas unbalanced conditions affect the growth and health of the host (Zhang et al., 2016;McCabe & Parameswaran, 2018;Wang et al., 2018).
