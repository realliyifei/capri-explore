## (s1) Research method
(p1.0) To comprehensively report on the current research, we set the following four research objectives: (1) To identify the types and influencing factors of policies affecting the real estate market.(2) To analyze core changes in housing prices after the implementation of housing policies.(3) To compare the similarities and differences in the literature on the impact of housing policies on the real estate markets from different periods, countries, research methods, and themes.(4) Based on the identified knowledge gaps, several directions that can open new approaches for future research are proposed.
## (s2) Retrieval strategy
(p2.0) This study adopts a systematic quantitative literature review method [19,20] to search and categorize the literature, which provides a repeatable and reliable assessment of the current state of the field of study.How papers are found, selected, and classified is articulated, minimizing the potential bias that emerges in some narrative-style reviews [21].The resulting quantitative assessment documents the geographical distribution of the literature, types of methods used, and types of results obtained.

(p2.1) Combined with relevant literature, the keywords used in the literature search include "policy," "real estate," "housing price," "housing policy," "government," "economy," and "tax."The search rules used are for English literature in which the keywords appear in the titles and abstracts.Using a two-way "snowball" technique, we backtrack all references reported in identified articles and forward through Google Academic to find all articles citing the original article.

(p2.2) The journal period was set from 2012 to 2022.Considering that many countries and regions have experienced adjustments and evolutions in housing policies following the 2008 financial crisis, it is important to examine the research between 2012 and 2022 to understand governmental decisions and reforms in response to housing market challenges.Moreover, during this period, the socioeconomic, technological, and environmental factors significantly changed.Housing policies also require corresponding adjustments and innovations considering the development of The Times.Furthermore, selecting articles from the past 10 years can provide the latest research results and data to reflect current housing policies and changes in the real estate market.This can provide the most accurate real-time information and reflect the implementation and effects of policy measures.Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Academic electronic databases were used to conduct an extensive online literature search.The first step was a preliminary screening of the titles and abstracts of articles.The reference tables for the inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1.
## (s4) Literature quality evaluation
(p4.0) According to the criteria listed in Table 3 [22], two researchers independently evaluated the quality of the included studies using quality evaluation standards.In cases of disagreement or failure to reach unity, three researchers were assigned to assist with the judgment.A total of 10 contents were evaluated and each item was evaluated by "yes," "no," or "unclear."All the aforementioned criteria met level A, indicating the least possibility of bias.Partial satisfaction implied level B, indicating a moderate possibility of bias.Grade C was unsatisfactory, indicating a high possibility of bias.Grade C literature was excluded.
## (s10) Methods of housing policy research studies
(p10.0) Scholars have used various methods to clarify the transmission mechanisms of policies on real estate (Table 6).Extensive methods have been used to identify the impacts of policies on the housing market.Most studies have adopted econometric methods.However, some scholars have adopted the vector auto-regression (VAR) model l7, with some differences between their models; for example [28], used Markov Switching Vector Auto Regression (MSVAR) models [29], used a time-varying vector auto-regressive model, and [30,31] used a factor-augmented vector auto-regressive (FAVAR) model.Some scholars have adopted the general equilibrium model in five articles, difference-in-differences model in four articles, and regression model in three articles.Other quantitative models used to study the impacts of policies on the real estate market include the symmetric thermal optimal path (TOPS) method [23] and structural break models [32].
## (s11) Housing policy analysis and evaluation of studies
(p11.0) After analyzing the 45 papers, we divided the results based on the effectiveness of the policies on the real estate market, tools of policy impact on the real estate market, spillover effect of policies on the real estate market, regional heterogeneity of policy impact on the real estate market, and impact of policies on the real estate market bubble, as shown in Table 7.

(p11.1) Among the 45 studies, 25 discussed the effectiveness of policies on the housing market, and six of them examined the effectiveness of the monetary policy [33] The impact of the money supply expansion has stimulated the property sector, but only in the short-term, with little impact on prices [28].Expansionary monetary policy shocks have significant effects only during normal economic periods [31].Monetary policy shocks have lasting effects on housing prices and property wealth [23].Aggressive monetary policy forcefully intervenes in the housing market [34].Loose monetary conditions can lead to surges in property lending and housing bubbles [35].The expansionary monetary policy affects the Italian economy.Housing policies have positive impacts on the real economy, real estate (RE) output as a commodity, value-added, and pricing.
## (s16) Influence of housing policy on real estate factors of studies
(p16.0) The main factor affecting the real estate market was the change in housing prices, as shown in Table 9.A total of 25 studies (55.56%) used housing prices as data.Other factors were combined with housing prices to reflect market changes [53]; these includes housing prices, incomes, and residential mortgage rates [24].Regarding housing prices and credit, some scholars have studied the real
## (s22) Influence of housing policies in different countries on the real estate market
(p22.0) With different development levels in the real estate market, the level of government control also changes to formulate policies for the real estate market.Europe, South America, and some Asian countries are developed, and their real estate markets are mainly follow the free-market economic system.Of course, different countries have different free-market economies, welfare levels, and government influences on real estate development.In some developing countries in Asia, government supervision and market operations are combined, and the housing marketization level is not high; therefore, the government significantly influences real estate development.There also exist large differences in each country's housing system policies.In some countries, the differences in resident income are small, degree of housing commercialization is not high, government holds significant influence on the real estate market, and housingrelated subsidies are strong.In some free welfare countries, the housing supply is dominated by the market, and the government only provides housing security to a small number of low-income groups to compensate for market failures.The government's role in guiding and regulating the market economy also differs.

(p22.1) Europe: Several institutional and macroeconomic factors, some specific to individual countries, affect the different performances of European housing markets.After the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, the real estate market in Germany remained stable because of a few reasons.First, the country developed a prudent monetary policy on mortgage loans, under which, bank loans were determined based on the minimum value of real estate instead of the market price; this prevented the periodicity of lending.Meanwhile, banks provided fixed-interest-rate mortgage loans to reduce the risk of default.Another country formulated policies to regulate the real estate rental market.For example, rent could not be freely raised; therefore, families did not completely rely on house purchases.This had a certain substitution effect, transferred the financial risks generated by house purchases, and helped maintain market stability [67].Similarly, in France, housing-related policies have always been an important issue for the government.To stabilize the real estate market, the government has formulated interest-free loan policies that, to some extent, have solved first-time house owners' demands.Housing policies have significant affected land prices [41].A study on the impact of national fiscal policy changes on the real estate market in Spain has used background data from 2004 to 2015 provided by real estate agents and conducted a difference-in-difference estimation for the improved identification strategy.They have considered two fiscal policies, tax credit and Value Added Taxes rate changes for new house purchases and concluded that the tax policy has a negative causal effect on the real estate market [68].

(p22.2) C. Zhao and F. Liu Kucharska-Stasiak et al. (2022) have comprehensively demonstrated the need for EU policies on housing-related issues [69].The introduction of property taxes in Italy has affected construction activities in the real estate market [32].Among the tax policies, income tax has a significant impact on the real estate market's investment demand, providing strategies for Italy to regulate the real estate market and formulate relevant fiscal policies [55].Real estate plays a significant role in the Italian economic system.A dynamic financially calculable general equilibrium model has been used to analyze the impact of monetary policy on the real estate market economy.The results show that European banks' quantitave easing policy has had a positive impact on the region's real estate market [35].
