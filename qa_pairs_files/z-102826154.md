(p4.0) Seshaiah Krishnan Sridhar et.al., reported the synthesis of synthesis of hydrazones, schiff and mannich bases of isatin derivatives (8).The compounds were screened for antibacterial activity on strains: Bacillus subtillus, Staphylococcus aureous, E.coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the active compounds were determined.1-Diphenyl amino-methyl-3-(4bromo phenylimino)-1, 3-dihydro-indol-3-one and 3-(4-bromo phenylimino)-5-nitro-1, 3-dihydroindol-3one were found to be the most active compounds of the series(Seshaiah KS et. al., 2001).
## (s5) 8 Sanjay
(p5.0) Bari et.al., reported the synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some new isatin derivatives (9) antimicrobial activity of compounds with 5bromo substitution showed the most favorable antimicrobial activity(Sanjay B et. al., 2006).
