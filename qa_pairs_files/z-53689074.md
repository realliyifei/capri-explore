## (s6) Cameroon Pidgin English (CPE) as a Tool for Empowerment and National
(p6.0) The example illustration above clearly shows that CPE is exactly like Bafut (in terms of formation of the present and past forms of the verb) but differs from English. The paper has revealed that English is the lexifier of CPE, but the language (CPE) has adopted the syntax of African language. Also, CPE is a major lingua franca; hence, its use as the language of education would not be a problem. However, Neba et al. (2006) have recognized some potential problems that are likely to be encountered in the process of this standardization and adoption. The first one is the problem of acceptability. Many people who have the notion that CPE has a negative impact on the English language may resist such a policy.
## (s27) Domains of Language Use
(p27.0) GhaPE has not got any formal recognition in Ghana. Though quite a number of unpublished Masters and PhD theses in various research institutions have focused on this variety, the only comprehensive published book remains Huber"s Ghanaian Pidgin English in its West African Context (Adika, 2012).
