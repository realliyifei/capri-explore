## (s6) Application of resilient control to power system
(p6.0) In recent years, NCSs have received an increasing research interest due to their wide applicabilities to smart grids (Lee, Clark, Bushnell, & Poovendran, 2014), intelligent transportation , industrial control systems, navigation systems (Kilinc, Ozger, & Akan, 2015), teleoperation or remote systems (Truong & Ahn, 2015) and so on. For the NCSs, sensors, actuators, control processing unites and communication devices are connected via networks (Han, Xie, Chen, & Ling, 2014), which renders several challenging problems such as time delays (Qiu, Li, Xu, & Xu, 2015;Zhang, Feng, Yan, & Chen, 2016), packets dropout (Li, Chow, & Sun, 2009), packets disorder (Liu, Zhang, Yu, Liu, & Chen, 2015), quantization (Peters, Quevedo, & Ostergaard, 2016;Yan, Xia, & Li, 2014), cyber attacks  and so on.
