## (s7) Data synthesis
(p7.0) A convergent qualitative synthesis design was selected and results from the identified studies were transformed into qualitative findings [25], using a narrative synthesis as described by Harrison et al. [26] and Dixon-Woods et al. [27].This approach was selected as studies were heterogeneous.
## (s26) Objective structured clinical examination
(p26.0) Meskell et al. [33] and Walsh et al. [7] both examined OSCE.Meskell et al. [33] evaluated the benefits of using an electronic OSCE assessment system in undergraduate students (n = 203).The electronic software facilitated the storage and analysis of results, thus offering significant time savings.Walsh et al. [7] were focused on the development of a Novice OSCE that included the following competencies: safety, asepsis, knowledge, organization, and caring.An instrument-testing design on a sample of nursing students (n = 565) was used.The MMAT score of both papers was 50%.Some psychometric analysis, reliability, and stability of OSCE tool should be done.OSCE is shown as a formative assessing tool, and it is argued that students should also be assessed in critical thinking and problem-solving skills in addition to clinical skills performance [1,35].
## (s27) Complex assessment approaches
(p27.0) Three studies focused on more complex approaches.Athlin et al. [28] developed a model of a National Clinical Final Examination (NCFE).Their model integrates knowledge from theoretical and practical studies and includes knowledge, skills, capacity of critical thinking, problemsolving, ethical reasoning, independence, and readiness to act.They prepared a two-part examination.This included a written theoretical test with problem-solving characteristics and a bedside test performing nursing care by using observation.Their model was used to assess theoretical and practical knowledge.They found that the model was highly appreciated, and its relevance, usability, and validity were considered as "quite good" for the assessment of nursing students' clinical competence at the final stage of their education.This study recorded a high MMAT score (75%).There is a need to evaluate the model on extensive students' groups because the study was completed using a relatively small sample in theoretical test (n = 73) and a bedside test (n = 68).The model for evaluation of theoretical and practical knowledge used a holistic approach with opportunities for feedback and reflection for students.Imanipour and Jalili [31] developed an assessment system including multiple methods.They used a combination of oral examination and direct observation of a procedural skill.The cognitive knowledge was evaluated by oral exam, and clinical skills were evaluated by direct observation using a global rating scale.The exam includes some generic procedures and two specific procedures.Clinical work sampling was used to evaluate undergraduate bachelor of nursing students' (n = 38) professional behavior.They found that the students and instructors were very satisfied with a comprehensive clinical performance assessment system.Levett-Jones et al. [32] describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Structured Observation and Assessment of Practice (SOAP) model used to assess the third-year undergraduate nursing students' (n = 1031) clinical competences.While significant enhancements have been identified in students' overall performance, the SOAP approach has discovered an insufficiency in the learning outcomes of some students.
## (s28) Other approaches
(p28.0) Khan et al. [14] evaluated nursing students' perceptions about the effectiveness of utilized teaching and learning strategies of clinical education in improving students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes: demonstration, reflection, and problem-based learning, and concept map.They used both qualitative and quantitative methods in a descriptive cross-sectional study of 74 nursing students to identify nursing students' perceptions about the efficacy of the applied teaching and learning strategies used in clinical education.Problem-based learning and the use of concept maps were perceived to be effective teaching and learning strategies.Hengameh et al. [29] compared the routine evaluation method (a subjective judgment of an instructor about general skills of the student during their clinical course, hence the scoring) with direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) (clinical activities evaluated based on direct observation using the checklists).They found that applying direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) significantly enhanced clinical skills and students' scores in clinical procedures.
## (s29) Discussion
(p29.0) The aim of this chapter was to review the literature and critically discuss in relation to identified methods of clinical nursing skills assessment and competencies currently used in nursing higher education.Multidimensional approaches in nursing assessment should be based on a number of differing assessments methods [1].It should be the combination of knowledge, critical thinking, caring and communication [1,7,30], problem-solving, and reflection [36].Holistic assessment was found to encourage students to be more person-centered [37], rather than purely task-oriented [32].
## (s30) Implications for nursing education
(p30.0) Assessment of clinical nursing skills requires collaboration between clinical partners and academia to enhance the clinical experiences of students, the professional development of preceptors or mentors, and the clinical credibility of academics [34].The findings from the literature review represent a first opportunity to prepare our own assessment tools, according to the cultural and clinical environment, material and economic conditions, national nursing standards, capabilities and purposes of nursing care in Slovenia.There is now an opportunity for all educational institutions with the nursing study programs in the country to prepare assessment tool with cooperation of students, educational experts, and clinical nursing experts.
