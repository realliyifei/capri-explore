## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Cannabis sativa, commonly known as cannabis (Family: Cannabaceae), is one of the oldest crops cultivated and has various religious and medicinal values [1]. Nondrug assortment of cannabis is popularly known as hemp, often used in food and textile industries [2].

(p0.1) The genus Cannabis is taxonomically classified into three different species: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. The sativa and indica species are primarily developed owing to their medicinal and commercial benefits compared to ruderalis [3]. Cannabis is known to yield more than 400 chemicals [4] of different classes, out of which 144 are cannabinoids with pharmacologically varying effects [5]. The most notable ones are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the major psychoactive compound, while CBD is the nonpsychoactive moiety [6].
## (s3) Cannabinoid 1 (CB1) Receptors
(p3.0) In the central nervous system, high CB1 distribution is present in regions of olfactory bulbs (inner granule and inner plexiform layer) [41,42], forebrain regions of cerebral neocortex frontal lobe (II, III, V, VI layers of frontal lobe) [41], regions of the hippocampus (stratum pyramidale), dentate Gyrus (granule cell layer), and amygdala [41,43,44]. The receptor distribution varies from low to moderate in the thalamus (low), hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens [45][46][47].
## (s5) Cannabis and Cognitive Functions
(p5.0) The role of cannabis on cognitive functions is a matter of long debate. Endogenous cannabinoids (AEA and 2 AG) are involved in memory and learning (including rewarding processing) through pre-and postsynaptic modulation (crucial for learning) [70][71][72]. CB1 receptors are involved in the modulation of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter (glutamate, GABA, and DA) activities [73]. The basal ganglionic and cerebellar presence of endocannabinoids and its mediated interaction of CB1 receptors with DA elicits their additional role in cognition and emotional regulation [74]. A recent study displayed the social, behavioral, and communicational alterations similar to the features established in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the CB1 knockout mice, indicating the critical role of CB1 receptors in core behavioral domains [75]. In contrast, another study demonstrated that genetic disruption of CB1 receptor gene resulted in improvement of behavioral habituation [76].
## (s7) Cannabis and Memory Consolidation
(p7.0) Memory consolidation is a time-dependent mechanism by which a temporary, vulnerable memory is evolved to a more stable and long-lasting form and becomes immune to intrusion from competing influences in the absence of further practice [156]. Memory continues to mature between encoding and recall via the consolidation process [157]. The overall endocannabinoid system plays a modulatory role in the coherence of neuronal activity in the brain regions (hippocampus, amygdala, PFC), leading to consolidation of aversive or arousing experiences through CB1 activation [158][159][160], thereby suggestive of the involvement of endocannabinoids in memory consolidation.

(p7.1) Emotional stress and aversive and arousal events stimulated neurological systems that played an integral role in memory consolidation and maintaining the strength of memories in accordance with their emotional significance [161]. Garcia et al. (2016) explored the role of CB1 receptors on stress-induced impairment of nonemotional memory consolidation. Interestingly, the study revealed that both central and peripheral mechanisms are involved in the stress-induced object-recognition memory impairment acting through CB1 receptors of adrenergic and nonadrenergic cells. The study by Busquets-Garcia et al. also opened newer avenues in the treatment of stress-related cognitive aspects [162].

(p7.2) Cannabinoids and CB1 receptor agonists were also shown to modulate memory function by affecting memory consolidation [163][164][165]. A preclinical investigation by  showed that infusion of URB597, a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, selectively increased AEA levels in the basolateral complex of the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC, and thus enhanced memory, suggesting the critical role of endogenously released AEA in memory consolidation [166]. Nevertheless, memory consolidation is prevented by CB1 antagonism mediated by intrahippocampal infusion of the receptor antagonist, thus hampering long-term memory consolidation by inhibiting LTP [167,168].
