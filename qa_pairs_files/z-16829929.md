## (s1) II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
(p1.0) To the best of our knowledge, there are no comprehensive surveys performed on visualization tools for environmental data.However, a survey similar to ours was conducted for visualization tools of biological network analysis [5].Visualization tools such as Medusa, Cytoscape, BioLayout Express3D, ProViz, and Pajek were reviewed in this survey.These tools were assessed based on their visualization capabilities, efficiency, compatibility with other tools, supported input data formats, user-friendliness, and applicability.

(p1.1) The authors summarize the survey by suggesting tools for each outlined challenge such as integration of heterogeneous data, scalability, interconnectivity, and pattern recognition.Also, several of the more specialized tools that are used for visualizing the biological networks are mentioned, but are not reviewed in the survey.Furthermore, standard network file formats used for representing biological networks such as BioPAX, SBML, CellML and RDF are discussed and evaluated.The paper also discusses several challenges faced by visualization tools representing biological networks.For example, one of such challenges is user-friendliness in the case when thousands of nodes need to be visualized (because most tools become less efficient and slower when operating with large datasets).The authors suggest outsourcing the computational load by using web services or rewriting the existing algorithms.Another challenge faced by the visualization tools is that of representing heterogeneous data.

(p1.2) A comparison of information visualization tools was conducted by Aigner et al [6].Tools such as Tableau, Xmdv Tool, Spotfire, and ILOG Discovery were evaluated and compared, basic user tasks with one or two variables and advanced tasks dealing with complex problems were tested, the features and functions offered by the tools were categorized, and a matrix stating the features offered by each tool was presented.The suggested improvements to the surveyed visualization tools include incorporating standard input file formats and supporting large datasets.

(p1.3) Existing visualization tools for environmental data such as IBM Data Explorer, OceanShare, ImmerseDesk, CAVE, and Infinity Wall were briefly reviewed by Mozzafari and Seffah [7].These tools were found to be useful for integrating heterogeneous data but less intuitive and unable to link multivariate data.The paper mainly presents a toolkit that offers interaction and visualization services.The services include gaining insight into singular data with the help of visualizations, using interaction techniques to link visualized data, and discovering hidden patterns and relationships in large datasets.
## (s33) IV. A SIMPLE TAXONOMY OF VISUALIZATION TOOLS
(p33.0) The existing visualization methods for environmental data can be classified based on several factors.Many researchers have introduced a taxonomy for visualization techniques [18].For example, Shneiderman classified visualization techniques based on data types and user tasks [19].Specific data types include 1D, 2D, 3D, multidimensional, temporal, tree, and network.The user tasks considered by Schneiderman to classify the methods were overview, zoom, filter, details-on-demand, relate, history, and extract.Keim classified the methods based on data types and interaction/distortion techniques [20].His data types were similar to those used by Schneiderman, except for algorithms/software.Interaction methods such as standard, projection, filtering, zoom, distortion, and link brush were considered for classification.Silva et al [21] classified the methods based on visualization and interaction features, Muller et al [22] structured them as static and dynamic, Chi [23] classified them based on visualization processes and Tory [24] grouped them based on the characteristics of the models of data employed.While these classifications are more generic, in this paper we propose a taxonomy of visualization methods based on the data types used to represent environmental data.Specifically, the usual types of environmental data are: onedimensional, such as atmospheric pressure and wind velocity; two-dimensional, which result from a combination of two variables, for example temperature and humidity; threedimensional, which involve a combination of three variables; multi-dimensional, which are a combination of more than three variables; and finally, climate-related text data that can be found in the documents or news.
