## (s7) INFLUENCE OF TYPE OF SUPPLEMENTATION ON RUMEN DEGRADATION
(p7.0) In experiment with cattle, Bailey et al. (2012) observed the effects of supplemental energy sources on nutrient digestion.Supplementation with glucose tended to decrease ruminal neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility.Otherwise, more precision of the rate of increasing casein supplementation increased ruminal concentrations of NH 3 , acetate, and propionate.Supplemental energy decreased plasma urea-N concentration, but casein level did not affect it.

(p7.1) In a study with cattle to evaluate the effects of supplementation with different sources of energy and nitrogenous compounds on the interaction of the in vitro growth and production of bacteriocin of lactic acid bacteria Carvalho et al. (2011), selected microorganisms according to the energy sources and nitrogenous compounds and concluded that starch promote growth of lactic acid bacteria when compared to cellulose.Supplementation with true protein (soy peptone and casein) stimulated the growth of these bacteria when compared to without supplementation with nitrogenous compounds.Moreover, urea addition does not stimulate the growth of lactic acid bacteria.Sources of true protein increase the competition between non-structural and structural carbohydrates fermenting bacteria (Figure 2).
## (s11) PROTEOLYSIS IN THE RUMINAL ENVIRONMENT
(p11.0) Understand of characteristics of the ruminal microbial population has opened new avenues of microbial ecology, such as the existence of hyperammoniaproducing bacteria (HAB) and how they can be used to improve N efficiency in ruminants (Krause et al., 2014).The excess of proteolysis by bacteria in the rumen can be detrimental (Bento et al., 2015), isolation and characterization of HAB in animals fed tropical diets or supplemented with rumen-degradable proteins.This work investigated the bacterial community diversity of the rumen of Nellore steers fed tropical forages, with or without casein supplementation (Table 1).Most bacteria produced a variety of VFA from trypticase fermentation, with a predominance of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid and formic acid.All the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria were Gram-positive, by ranking VFA as high, medium and low production for concentration of fermentation endproducts.

(p11.1) The proteolysis in the rumen can be beneficial to the animal host if the products are transformed into digestible microbial protein.The PEP are intermediates in the ruminal bacteria conversion of protein ingested ammonia and are a point at which the rate of breakage can be controlled.The rate of protein digestion in the rumen often exceeds the capacity of microorganisms to incorporate the AA released.This imbalance results in deamination and loss of ammonia through the rumen wall, one of the main causes of inefficient N retention by ruminants (Falconer and Wallace, 1998;Krause et al., 2014).
