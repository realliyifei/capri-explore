## (s12) Burn Triage
(p12.0) In this method, which is used to prioritise injured persons in burn events, the classification of the injured people is based on the severity and level of the burn (Table 2) [22], [23]. 
## (s17) TEWS triage (Triage Early Warning Score)
(p17.0) This method of triage is a numerical 5-level method, which was designed according to the experts' opinion for the injured people over 12 years of age and above the height of 150 centimetres ( Figure 12). Figure 12: TEWS triage (Wallis, 2006) [28] The injured person is placed in one of the five classes of red, orange, yellow, green and blue by the final score (Table 4) [28], [29]. 
## (s18) MPTT Triage (Modified Physiological Triage Tool)
(p18.0) The method has four tags including red, yellow, green and black, and the injured patients are assessed based on the ability to walk, respiration, pulse and GCS criteria ( Figure 13) [2]. 
## (s21) Smart Triage System
(p21.0) This method of triage is similar to the START triage system. In this system, it is highlighted that if it is not possible to examine the capillary filling criterion, the radial pulse should be controlled. The injured people are also classified into four categories: red, yellow, green, and black according to the algorithm that sown in Figure 15 [31].  (Cone, 2011) [31] 
## (s29) Sort Triage
(p29.0) This method, which is a kind of secondary triage, has four stages and a numerical system ( Figure 19). In this method of triage, patients are tagged according to the score obtained. If the number is 10 or less, the injured individual is placed at the red class, and if the number is equal to 11, he will be placed in the yellow class. A patient with 12 scores will be categorised in the green class [15].  (Smith, 2012) [15] Hospital Triage
