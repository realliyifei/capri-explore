## (s12) Evidence of the PKS in Angiogenesis and Inflammation
(p12.0) As known, IBDs are characterized by pathological intestinal inflammation associated with epithelial damage (like ulcers, fistulas, strictures, and abscesses) [58].In these diseases, angiogenesis is an important component for both pathogenesis and inflammation Ex vivo treatment of the gastrointestinal tract with PK1 evoked contractions of the duodenum, jejunum, and distal ileum, as well as relaxation of the distal colon.However, the maximal contractile responses to PK1 were obtained in ileal tissues.On the other hand, in vivo experiments have shown that oral administration of PK1 causes both an acceleration of upper gastrointestinal transit and an increase in the luminal fluid content in the intestine, suggesting that in the gut, PKS may act via local paracrine mechanisms to evoke potent prokinetic and secretory effects.

(p12.1) Altogether, these data suggest a clear involvement of the PKS in gastrointestinal motility/secretion, where the key players appear to be PK1 and PKR1.However, further studies are needed to explore the PK1/PKR1-mediated pathophysiological responses of IBDs in the gastrointestinal tract.
## (s13) Evidence of the PKS in Angiogenesis and Inflammation
(p13.0) As known, IBDs are characterized by pathological intestinal inflammation associated with epithelial damage (like ulcers, fistulas, strictures, and abscesses) [58].In these diseases, angiogenesis is an important component for both pathogenesis and inflammation [59].Additionally, cytokines and chemokines are directly implicated in IBD onset and have a crucial role not only in intestinal inflammation control but also in damage and regeneration processes.Recent studies have shown that aberrant and excessive cytokine responses characterized the initial phase of IBDs, causing acute or subclinical inflammation.In predisposed subjects, these conditions fail to be resolved, leading to chronic intestinal inflammation development due to the uncontrolled activation of the immune system (crucial role of macrophages and T cells) [60].Moreover, during IBD onset, physiological angiogenesis switches into a pathological one [61].Among the factor(s) inflammation and angiogenesis, an important role could be played by the PKS.The Ferrara group [62,63] identified PK1 as a selective angiogenic mitogen for endocrine gland-endothelial cells.Indeed, this protein presented striking biological/functional similarities to the VEGF family (but no structural homology), and for this reason the authors proposed its designation as endocrine-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF).It has been demonstrated that VEGF and EG-VEGF can function in a coordinated and/or complementary manner to regulate angiogenesis and permeability (Figure 8).
