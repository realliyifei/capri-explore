## (s2) Models of Supplier/Resource Selection in Conventional Enterprises
(p2.0) An extensive literature revision in this area framed the problem in a global form. Although it relates the pre-selection phase that is approached in some of the existing models, it concludes that the great majority of the models essentially approach the final selection phase. The models are divided in two main categories: single resource selection and multiple resource selection [10]. The following table intends to synthesize the classification of the selection models.

(p2.1) We can put into evidence that there is a myriad of methods and mathematical models, some of them used in distinct types of problems. This is an area where the approaches can be diverse. A complete and correct specification of the problem is essential, in order to foresee the type of model indicated for the problem.
