## (s2) Process-Based Soil Erosion Models
(p2.0) Models are simplifications of reality and can, by definition, never fully represent the processes of the real world. Because these models can only come close to reality, researchers are looking for a balance between modelling and reality. Depending on their area of spe-Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 2468 4 of 23 ciality, models feature different advantages and limitations. With improving knowledge, computing power and observational technologies, these limitations are constantly shifting towards models that are more realistic while also showing limits regarding reality. Where to exactly draw this line poses an almost philosophical question, answerable only by each individual model. In comparison to empirical models, process-based soil erosion models are more demanding regarding their input data, computing requirement and calibration necessity, and in general are less user-friendly. However, due to physically-based descriptions of soil erosion and sediment transport, the models offer an understanding and reproducibility of the occurring processes [23]. Such models allow for an isolated consideration of individual components of soil erosion processes as well as a better understanding of the relationship between cause and impact within soil erosion research [19]. While these models are process-oriented, they still contain empirical parts based on laboratory and site-specific field experiments. Even though they can be extrapolated to other scales, this aspect must still be treated with care [27].

## (s8) Parameterization Due to Developments in Resolution
(p8.0) Improved resolutions on ever larger areas and on temporal scales offer new information and fields of application. Such developments make satellite data more and more attractive. Using digital soil mapping data from, e.g., Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8, can serve as covariates to predict soil properties. They offer a great spectrum of information on, e.g., soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen, clay content of the soil and the "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index", with spatial resolutions up to 10 m [80][81][82]. Such information, which has been constantly improving over the last few decades, offer us input data today, with resolutions that are especially interesting to model applications covering medium to large areas. While they are able to generate information on large scales with revisiting times of a few days, the resolutions available in the scope of metres only enable information on erosional processes on larger scales.

## (s14) Challenges and Opportunities of Process-Based Soil Erosion Modelling in the Context of New and Improved Data Assessment Techniques
(p14.0) After viewing the limitations and opportunities of process-based soil erosion models, and soil and soil erosion assessment techniques, the following chapter aims to combine these aspects. It discusses the interaction and adaption of soil erosion models regarding parameterization, process understanding, scale, resolution, complexity and connectivity in respect of new and further developed assessment techniques. as flow velocity and flow path detection, as presented in Section 2.2.1 by Lin et al. [96]. While improved techniques will undoubtedly support validation interests and process understanding, it is debatable if workflows can be developed to include such data into soil erosion modelling and if the existing prediction tools can easily include such distributed, high-resolution data. The plan to integrate such data could lead to the need to further develop the simplified hydrological models, in many cases based on the kinematic wave, and cause the need to use more complex and computing power-intensive approaches, such as the Saint Venant equation.

## (s20) Connectivity
(p20.0) The complexity and multitude of processes taking place within a catchment affects sediment and water transfer throughout the system. To address management strategies and mitigation measurements, it is necessary to gain a complete overview of the system's connectivity, shifting the perspective away from the single slope and towards the connected system, taking a variety of spatial scales into account. This leads to a better understanding of the influence of human built structures and natural landforms on the continuity of water and sediment transfer throughout the system as well as the cause of off-site damages [139,140].
