## (s5) IV. QUIET ROOM
(p5.0) A quiet room or some may refer to it as "Escape Space", is one of the important design aspects in a learning environment for individuals with autism spectrum disorder [10], [11], [23]. "Escape Space" is a space that is intended as a 'relief' space when there is too much stimulation exposed in an environment [11], [23]. Another study has defined a quiet room as a room that provides a "calming effect" when autistic children show disturbing behavior caused by exhaustion, distressing feeling, and overstimulation [10].
## (s6) V. SAFETY
(p6.0) In creating space for autistic users, the safety aspect is crucially important since they have less awareness of danger and often show unexpected behavior [11]. Safety is mentioned as the most important concern in planning space for autistic students [11]. A room should not allow individuals with an autism spectrum disorder to harm their selves or others [10]. Physical hazards such as sharp edges and corners in a room are the example of safety consideration [23]. Considering its function to release maladaptive behavior, a quiet room should provide enough safety to prevent injuries that might happen due to aggressive behavior.
