Fields: Medicine, Biology

## (s3) The infectious agent and the host organism
(p3.0) The trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi invade phagocyte cells at the site of entry in the body.Some of the invading flagellates may be destroyed, but many of the internalized parasites replicate and complete the cycle, differentiating into new forms that invade other cells and tissues.The intracellular amastigotes can persist dormant in the host body for decades, hidden in muscle cells without causing significant damage to the tissues.

(p3.1) Target cell invasion involves microtubule-dependent lysosome recruitment and fusion at the site of attachment to the target cell plasma membrane (Tardieux et al. 1992, Andrade 2004, Chakrabarti et al. 2005).Upon internalization, the resulting acidic environment at the fusion site activates a secreted porin-like protein promoting trypomastigote escape from the phagocytic vacuole and differentiation into the dividing amastigote persisting in the cytoplasm (Andrews 2002) to initiate another cycle of infection.The fate of the infection depends on the ability of the virulent trypomastigotes to escape from the digestive enzymes in the phagolysosomes (Rao et al. 2004).Including a replicative lag period of at least 18 h and a mean population doubling time of 15 h, the complete intracellular cycle lasts four days (Engel et al. 1985).Cells harboring a high-density parasite load burst open and release differentiated forms that initiate new cycles of infection.Host defense mechanisms can control the reinfection process in moderate or low-density phagocyte invasion (reviewed in Teixeira et al. 1996).

(p3.2) Although vertebrate monocytes and macrophages are remarkably effective in overriding microbial infections, some kinetoplastids have evolved to survive in phagocyte cells possessing active NADPH oxidases through contributions of respiratory burst-derived reactive oxygen (O 2 -, H 2 O 2 ) or through nitrogen intermediates inducible by nitric oxide (NO) synthase (Murray & Nathan 1999).These mediators are related primarily to protective mechanisms.Hence, successful infection of macrophages depends on a variety of mechanisms that enable the brief existence of a flagellate within the harsh environment of a phagocytic cell (Andrews 2005).
## (s8) Acute Chagas disease
(p8.0) Most cases of acute T. cruzi infection are ascribed to triatomine bugs, the insect vector that transmits the protozoan.A delayed-type indurate skin lesion may appear at the portal of parasite entry in immune-competent hosts, but not in immune-compromised patients lacking cell-mediated immune response (Teixeira et al. 1978, Teixeira & Teixeira 1995).Acute infection in the latter case goes unperceived by the patient and/or by the physician in the absence of diagnostic signs and symptoms.A field study showed that approximately 75% of the acute cases were seen in children less than 10 years of age (reviewed in Teixeira 1987).
## (s9) Indeterminate phase
(p9.0) The chronically infected individual remains a life-long source of the parasite as an indeterminate phase reservoir.Approximately one third of all individuals with indeterminate infections will develop chronic Chagas disease.The indeterminate phase of infection has been defined based on criteria of (i) positive specific IgG antibody test and/or parasitological demonstration; (ii) absence of symptoms and signs of Chagas disease; (iii) absence of ECG abnormalities; (iv) regular size of heart, esophagus and colon by X-ray.Using these criteria, regardless of the geographic area where field studies have been conducted, it has been estimated that two thirds of T. cruzi-infected individuals will remain in this condition during their economically-productive lives.Thus most patients with indeterminate infections are 20 to 50 years of age, comprising approximately 12 million people with positive immunologic tests for the parasite.Their life span is similar to that observed for the general population (Macedo 1999).Usually indeterminate phase individuals are identified as such during job application or blood bank screening.Denial of work is unjustified, but the candidate is disqualified from blood donation.
## (s10) Chronic cardiac disease
(p10.0) The cardiomyopathy associated with chronic infection has made Chagas disease the most lethal endemic infectious disease in the Western hemisphere (Cubillos-Garzon 2004).In a randomized urban study, the prevalence of chronic Chagas disease reached 18% of the street cleaners Brasília, Brazil (Lauria-Pires et al. 2000).Among these 245 chagasics, only two could recall an acute infection stage.This description is in keeping with the epidemiological truth that for each chagasic with a clinically disclosed acute phase of the infection, there are 125 cryptic patients.Clinical studies have shown unparalleled levels of ECG abnormalities in patients showing positive serologic tests for infection when compared with the nonchagasic population.The main life-threatening manifestations of chronic heart disease are heart failure, arrhythmias and thromboembolism.ECG abnormalities are cumulative over time and become more frequent from 20 years post acute infection.Chronic T. cruzi infections lead to an increasing number of ECG alterations recorded on two occasions 10 years apart (Lauria-Pires et al. 2000).Ventricular premature contractions, right bundle branch block, combined branch block, intraventricular conduction disturbance, and ventricular repolarization changes were recorded more frequently over time.These alterations were many-fold more frequent in Chagas patients than in controls (p < 0.001).The progressively shifting right bundle branch blocks in particular were recorded more frequently than the remaining ECG alterations in the Chagas patient population.ECG revealed ventricle wall hypokinesis and intracavitary thrombus.The heart enlargement in Chagas patients is an ominous sign, leading to a poor prognosis (Lauria Pires et al. 2000).A word of caution is needed because the severely compromised Chagas patient may die during a Holter-type ECG monitoring of arrhythmias and other heart disturbances.Moreover, patients having apparently stable ECG changes may show sudden flare-ups of an underlying defect leading to heart failure.The variability of the ECG and clinical manifestations is remarkable: Some patients showing cumulative changes in successive ECG recordings apparently halt the evolving life-threatening arrhythmias and lead a normal life.

(p10.1) In one population of chronic patients, 57% mortality was related to Chagas disease, of which 58% had heart insufficiency, and 37.5% died suddenly (Prata 1999).The remaining deaths were related to the digestive forms associated with chronic disease.The average time between acute infection and development of severe chronic Chagas lesions has been estimated at 28 ± 7 years (Prata 2001).However, Chagas cardiomyopathy rapidly progresses toward death no longer than 5 years after signs of heart failure.A common finding in death resulting from heart failure is cerebral infarction as a consequence of a thrombus detached from the left ventricle.
## (s11) Digestive form of Chagas disease
(p11.0) Gastrointestinal disorders are among the most common clinical manifestations of chronic Chagas disease.A clinical study aimed at the evaluation of autonomic function in chagasic patients showed esophageal alterations usually occurred earlier in the course of the chronic infections when compared to similar abnormalities in the heart (reviewed in Macedo 1999).A digestive disease patient may complain of difficulty swallowing and regurgitation of food, clinical symptoms related to megaesophagous.Alternatively, some complain of constipation due to a fecal bolus in the rectal ampoule as a result of megacolon.Megaesophagous and megacolon are seen frequently in endemic areas; patients showing these conditions bear specific antibodies to T. cruzi and consistently positive nucleic acid tests (NAT) assays.These 'mega' conditions can affect individual patients independently, in association with each other or in association with heart disease.

(p11.1) Megaesophagus can manifest clinically in chagasics as early as 2 years of age or any time throughout life, although the majority of cases are seen in men between 20 and 40 years old.Megaesophagus anticipates heart trouble in many patients.The disease manifests by dysphagia, heartburn, hiccups, regurgitation of food, and increasing salivation.This clinical picture associates chagasics megaesophagus and caquexis resulting from difficulty to eat.The disease appears to evolve during periods of dysphagia followed by long periods during which symptoms are absent.

(p11.2) Megacolon is seen considerably later in the course of Chagas disease in comparison with megaesophagus.The main symptom of chagasic megacolon is constipation.The progressive retention of hardened bolus leads to dilation and thickening of the walls of the colon, usually compromising the sigmoid colon and rectum.Difficulty with passing of bolus leads to dilation of the remaining intestines, increasing bowel movements, pain, and constant physical distress.The long-term use of laxatives can cause ulcerations of mucosal surfaces, septicemia, rupture of the wall of the intestine and peritonitis.Typical complications of megacolon are intestinal obstruction and rupture (reviewed in Prata 1999).
## (s12) Pathology in human Chagas disease
(p12.0) Data on gross and microscopic pathology of acute Chagas disease was derived from two cases (Teixeira et al. 1970).The access to slides with sections from the two patients was kindly provided by Dr Moysés Sadigursky, from the Hospital of the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil.Data on chronic Chagas disease stems from ARLT's records of 20 post-mortem studies carried out personally at the Hospital of the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil, and at the Hospital of the University of Brasília, Brazil.
## (s13) Acute Chagas disease
(p13.0) In the human body T. cruzi can parasitize any tissue derived from embryonic mesoderm, endoderm, and neuroectoderm.However, the intensity of infection in the body varies from case to case, likely depending on the genetics of host and parasite (Campbell et al. 2004).Mesodermderived conjunctive tissues smooth and striated muscles, bone marrow and phagocytic mononuclear systems, and gonadal cells can be heavily parasitized.The histopathology of an 18 month-old boy and of a 4 month-old girl who died of acute Chagas disease (Teixeira et al. 1970) revealed niches of amastigotes inside the theca cells of the ovary and inside the goniablasts of seminiferous tubes of the testes.Reproductive apparati were rarely examined previously in the course of T. cruzi infections.Endodermal tissue structures are eventually parasitized by amastigotes; epithelial cells of liver, kidneys, thyroid, pancreas, and other glands are spared infection.Neuroectoderm cells are parasitized less frequently than other embryonic-derived tissues; if the infection reaches the nervous system, glial cells, usually astrocytes, are invaded.Some T. cruzi isolates concentrate infection in the mononuclear phagocytic system, while others distribute themselves randomly in non-phagocytic muscle cells, where they evade the immune system.In striated heart and skeletal muscle amastigotes form large niches (a pseudo-cyst or cavity without a limiting wall) in the absence of inflammation.However, degenerative features of parasite-free muscle cells can be associated with inflammatory infiltrates.Similar aspects are present in smooth muscle cells all through the digestive tract.Features of the inflammatory lesions in the digestive tract are similar to those in the heart in that mononuclear cells invade parasympathetic ganglion structures situated between the peripheral and inner layers of the walls (Auerbach's plexus) and in the internal sub-mucosal layer (Meissner's plexus).Amastigotes may be present in fibroblasts, Schwan cells, and glial cells, but not in neurons.Nevertheless, neuronal lysis associates adherence of mononuclear cells of the immune system and depopulation of target neurons.Inflammatory infiltrates associate with glial and neuronal cells, secondarily compromising parasite-free neurons.

(p13.1) Typically the heart of a deceased acute chagasic patient is enlarged, flabby, dilated, and congested.Lymph nodes situated between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, are engorged.The epicardial surface shows wideopen coronary vessels accompanied by whitish lymphatic vessels with tiny pearl-like nodules.These morphological changes presage the striking inflammatory infiltrates running through the walls of the heart.Microscopically, many muscle fibers and occasionally interstitial histiocytes show nests of dividing amastigotes.Mononuclear cells, mainly small and large lymphocytes with expanded cytoplasmic processes, and macrophages infiltrate the myocardium and adhere to the membrane of target heart cells.Several aspects of characteristic target cell destruction can be observed.Notably, some parasitized cells are isolated from the destructive inflammatory infiltrates.Parasite-free heart cells are mostly rejected or destroyed by immune system mononuclear cells.Confluence of multiple rejection units comprises the overall microscopic picture of lesions in acute Chagas disease.Inflammatory infiltrates invade cardiac parasympathetic ganglia where glial or Schwann cells can be parasitized, but neurons are spared.Adherence of inflammatory mononuclear cells to neurons leads to lysis and loss of several of these neural units in the acute phase.Additionally, inflammation extends into sympathetic nerves in the epicardial and intramural heart structures.

(p13.2) Involvement of central nervous system structures in the acute phase can be frequent, as T. cruzi can be recovered from the cerebral spinal fluid in 72.7% of cases (Hoff et al. 1985).However, in half of these cases there is a lack of alteration of fluid components and absence of neurological damage.In acute cases showing clinical manifestation of neurological involvement, lesions are related to meningitis and encephalitis.Overall, the brain can show congestion of blood vessels and edema.Brain tissue is damaged sparsely by inflammation around small blood vessels, vascular hemorrhages, and microglial cell nodular proliferation in the white and gray matter.Typically inflammatory cells invade the meningeal leaflets and encircle blood vessels inserted deep in the brain.T. cruzi nests can be seen in brain astrocytes.
## (s14) Indeterminate phase
(p14.0) Microscopic substrates for changes in the indeterminate phase were drawn from 20 biopsies revealing minimal inflammatory heart lesions (Mady et al. 1982) that were generally focal and small.Skeletal muscle biopsies showed spotty inflammation, target cell lyses and degeneration (Sicca et al. 1995).Inflammatory lesions in the heart, digestive tract, and skeletal muscle are similar to those seen in clinically manifest chronic disease patients, but to a much lower degree.Inflammatory infiltrates surround muscle fibers, resembling the minimal rejection unit of the target heart cell.In some cases multiple rejection units compromise a bundle of fibers in a single muscle; any nerve or sympathetic ganglion in the region can be affected by inflammatory infiltrates.In the digestive tract, lesions reaching the parasympathetic ganglia and neuronal cell depopulation have been observed (Lopes 1999).Progressive clinical-pathological lesions present in chronically infected chagasics classify the disease according to the affected organ.
## (s15) Chronic Chagas heart disease
(p15.0) Chronic Chagas heart disease affects individuals of both sexes equally, usually between 30 and 45 years of age.In patients showing progressive ECG alterations unexpected deaths occur at a rate of 37.5% (Prata et al. 1986, Lopes 1999), whereas 58% develop ominous signs of heart failure and usually die within 7 to 24 months (Dias 2000).Congestive failure involves the right and left chambers of the heart, thus affecting all blood circulation.The heart increases in size, occupying the base of the thoracic cavity and bulging against the chest wall.The average heart weight reaches 540 ± 90 g, in patients dying of congestive failure, whereas in those undergoing sudden death the weight reaches 390 ± 50 g.At the endocardial surface, the chambers of the heart become dilated and the walls can be thickened.A typical gross feature is the effacement of the apex of the left ventricle, showing aneurismal dilation.The presence of thrombus at different stages is seen frequently in the apex of the left ventricle and in the right atrium, and can be associated with thrombus embolism in the lung, brain, spleen, and kidney.Thrombus embolic phenomena in the brain and lungs are associated often with the ultimate cause of death in chronic heart disease.The epicardial surface of the heart shows dilated coronary vessels accompanied by lymph vessels with periodic, small, pearl-like nodules indicative of the drainage system from the subjacent myocardium inflammatory process.
## (s18) Birds
(p18.0) Birds are refractory to T. cruzi infection.Upon intravenous or intramuscular injections T. cruzi disappears immediately from the site of inoculation (Teixeira 1987) and cannot be recovered from bird blood by any means.However, inoculation of T. cruzi infective trypomastigotes in the air chamber of fertile chicken eggs results in intracellular growth of parasite amastigotes in embryo cells until the 10th day post-fertilization.Thereafter, the infection is eliminated by the embryo's innate immune mechanism (Nitz et al. 2004).
## (s19) Marsupialia
(p19.0) The Metatheria (Marsupialia: Didelphidae) and Eutheria (Edentata: Dasypodidae; Rodentia: Muridae) are considered the earliest mammals to become involved in the enzootic cycle of T. cruzi infection.Didelphidae and Dasypodidae, opossums and armadillos spp., respectively, are major sylvatic reservoirs (Legey et al. 1999, Yeo et al. 2005) The eco-epidemiology of enzootic Chagas disease in North America is dependent largely on the relationships of triatomine vectors with opossums and armadillos (Yaeger 1988, Karsten et al. 1992, Pung et al. 1995).T. cruzi infections among opossums ranged from 37.5% (Barr et al. 1991) to 57.1% (Ruiz-Pina and Cruz-Reyes 2002).

(p19.1) Wild marsupials have been subjected to karyotyping and parasitological and pathological examinations (Teixeira et al. 2001).The karyotype confirmed the animals to be D. marsupialis.Nine out of the 12 marsupials had protozoan flagellates that were isolated by xenodiagnosis and/or hemoculture.The metacyclic forms recovered by xenodiagnosis were then inoculated in weanling mice.Two weeks after injection, trypomastigotes morphologically indistinguishable from T. cruzi were detected in murine blood.Phenotypic and genotypic molecular characterizations showed that these isolates were indeed T. cruzi, with a profile matching the Berenice stock, a laboratory standard for virulent T. cruzi.

(p19.2) The pathology seen in heart sections from these naturally-infected marsupials showed myocarditis, characterized by mononuclear cell infiltrates and target cell lysis.Furthermore, inflammatory infiltrates were seen in the heart, skeletal muscle and in smooth muscle of the esophagus, and small and large intestines.Histopathological study of representative tissue sections taken from three opossums free of parasite showed an absence of tissue lesions (Teixeira et al. 2001).Araujo Carreira et al. (1996) found T. cruzi nests in the scent glands, hearts, and digestive tracts of 10 naturally-infected D. marsupialis.An inflammatory infiltrate of moderate to severe intensity was present in smooth and striated skeletal and heart muscles.Despite the presence of tissue lesions in wild T. cruziinfected marsupials, armadillos, and rodents, some researchers have proposed that these animals "learned to live in harmony" with T. cruzi and, therefore they do not display apparent disease (Legey et al. 1999).No longterm study has shown ratios of morbidity and mortality or the relative lifespans of wild mammalian reservoirs in the presence or absence of T. cruzi infections.
## (s20) Rodentia
(p20.0) Naturally T. cruzi-infected rodents (Rodentia: Echimyidae; Rodentia: Cricetidae; and Rodentia: Muridae) have been captured in various ecosystems on the American continents.In one study, the prevalence of parasite infection reached 9.1% of captured wild rodents (Raccurt 1996).Calomys callosus (Rodentia: Cricetidae) are resistant to T. cruzi, surviving inocula that normally kill mice (Borges et al. 1992).The histopathological analysis of sections from T. cruzi-infected rodents showed parasitism of liver cells and of striated muscles.Inflammatory infiltrates in heart and skeletal muscles were moderate or absent (Borges et al. 1983).Resistance to chronic infection appeared to correlate with interferon gamma serum levels and H 2 O 2 release by peritoneal macrophages.C. callosus may have developed immune mechanisms for survival and thus acts as a reservoir (Borges et al. 1995).The interaction of T. cruzi with the caviomorph rodent Trichomys apereoides (Rodentia: Echimyidae) revealed features suggestive of an ancient adaptation to T. cruzi infection.Chronic infection in T. apereoides remained pathologically cryptic for 5 months, despite persistence of infection (Herrera et al. 2004).
## (s22) Then I would still have this consolation -my joy in unrelenting pain -that I had not denied the words…
(p22.0) The availability of the rabbit model for human disease prompted evaluation of treatment of experimental Chagas animals with anti-trypanosomal nitro-derivatives.A dose of 8 mg/kg/day for 60 days of nitroderivatives was intraperitoneally inoculated in infected and uninfected rabbits.Chronic infection was accompanied by the finding of myocarditis in every Chagas heart, regardless of treatment (Fig. 5E).PCR assays with T. cruzi-specific and nDNA-nested sets of primers yielded amplification prod-ucts from Chagas rabbit DNA templates, regardless of treatment (Lauria-Pires et al. 2001).Thus, treatment of infected rabbits with nitroderivatives neither improved the Chagas heart lesions nor prolonged survival of treated animals (Teixeira et al. 1990a).Treated animals died in a time span comparable to infected, untreated rabbits.
## (s23) Carnivora
(p23.0) Dogs (Carnivora: Canidae) have been recognized as important animal hosts participating in the peridomicile lifecycle of T. cruzi.Dog (Canis domesticus) mortality in natural ecotopes is substantial with high levels of transmission where dogs eat contaminated bugs.This clinical veterinary problem is recognized in several regions of the American continents.Naturally infected dogs have been identified in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma (Bradley et al. 2000, Beard et al. 2003).In Cuesta Rica, it was shown that 27.7% of the dogs from five rural villages had T. cruzispecific serum antibodies.Positive dogs subjected to Xray and ECG revealed cardiomegaly and ECG alterations consistent with Chagas heart disease (Montenegro et al. 2002).
## (s28) Pathogenesis of Chagas disease
(p28.0) Questions related to the mechanism by which tissue lesions are formed in the course of T. cruzi infection have long been a matter of contentious debate.Although numerous reviews have proposed a plethora of brilliant hypotheses (Levin 1996, Kierszenbaum 1999), the origin of the pathological lesions of Chagas disease remains open to investigation.
## (s31) Integrated kDNA heritability and pathogenesis
(p31.0) If these observations are validated, we have created a powerful new research tool for the understanding of Chagas disease (Nitz et al. 2004) Acute Chagas pathology served as an indicator for examining if T. cruzi infection could be established in the goniablasts of the testes and the germinal theca cells of the ovary (see section acute pathology).Although invasion of embryonic stems cells had not been demonstrated, we assayed parasite uptake by stem cells in vitro: embryo stem cells from a 2.5-day-old zygote actively engulfed trypomastigotes (Nitz et al. 2004).Amastigotes loaded the cytoplasm of rabbit embryonic cells, and similar kinetics was observed with infected chicken embryonic cells.The permissiveness of embryonic stem cells to T. cruzi suggested that differentiating cells in the genital crest, which appear at days 4-8.5 of gestation, could acquire integrated kDNA-induced mutations during early parasite invasion.

(p31.1) Thus, embryonic cells became candidates for vertical or germline transfer of kDNA integration-associated mutations.Transplacental transmission of T. cruzi and subsequent kDNA integration was attempted experimentally in litters from chronically-infected Chagas rabbits.Four sexually mature does and two bucks infected with T. cruzi were crossbred during chronic infection.Three pregnancies resulted in 104 offspring.NAT assays on stillborn animals or surviving offspring of infected rabbits were performed for parasite nDNA and kDNA, revealing that 15 (14.4%) contained nDNA suggestive of active infection, and 24 (23%) contained kDNA only.Stillborn offspring yielded DNA from heart, skeletal muscle, liver, spleen, and large and small intestine, and each tissue type was positive for specific kDNA probes.In the case of a chronically-infected pregnant doe that delivered six offspring, five showed positive NAT for kDNA; one yielded positive NATs for kDNA and nDNA.Thus five presented vertical transfer of kDNA via the parental gametes, whereas only one received a transplacental living infection (Fig. 8A, B).Genomic DNAs of kDNA-positive offspring were subjected to 5' RACE, yielding six integration sites of minicircle fragments (GenBank AY488498 to AY488503).Typical histopathological lesions in muscle tissues, which were usually extensive in the peripheral nervous systems of T. cruzi-infected rabbit offspring, were similar to those lesions seen in chagasic rabbits and humans (see human pathology and lagomorpha sections).A living infection is necessary for kDNA integration.

(p31.2) With the demonstration of vertical transfer of kDNA from chronically-infected rabbits to offspring, the high frequency with which parasite kDNA could be inherited by its host in a Mendelian fashion was evident, along with the presence of kDNA fragments in diverse tissue types (Fig. 9A, B).

(p31.3) To eliminate persistent infection as a requirement for kDNA integrations in the host genome, experiments were conducted in chickens that are refractory to chronic T. cruzi infection.Thus, the permissiveness of chicken embryonic cells to experimental T. cruzi infection was shown, making dissociation of the kDNA integration event and pathology from the presence of the active infection possible.Minicircle kDNA integrated at the chicken chromosome 4 (GenBank AY237306).Use of the aves model provided the basis for parasite-free pathology in chicken that  was indistinguishable from human Chagas pathology (Nitz et al. 2004).Introduced kDNA was present in 25% of chicks hatched from T. cruzi-inoculated eggs.Due to the refractory nature of the chicken to T. cruzi infection, the pathological lesions described in kDNA-positive chickens eliminate any role of parasite persistence.With establishment of germline kDNA integration in the chicken genome, vertical transfer of T. cruzi DNA to infection-free progeny was demonstrated.Interestingly, the birds from F0 and F1 progeny developed signs of widespread muscle weakness, with some individuals not strong enough to stand.Usually chickens showing this systemic disease died young: Striated heart and skeletal muscle, smooth muscles and the parasympathetic ganglia showed typical lesions seen in chagasic mammals (Fig. 10A, B, C, D).The parasite-free Chagas heart disease in chicken showed minimal rejection units as seen in human Chagas patients, characterized by mononuclear infiltrates and lyses of target heart cells (Fig. 11A, B, C, D).Thus, kDNA integration represents a likely cause for the autoimmune response and may be the key to understanding chronic Chagas disease manifestation (Nitz et al. 2004).

(p31.4) Numerous instances of kDNA integration into genomes of vertebrates infected with T. cruzi have been documented.Mapping of kDNA insertion sites, including active mobilization via the LINE-1 transposition machinery (Symer et al. 2002), may correlate with the variable and delayed clinical manifestations.LINE sequences polluted the vertebrate genomes over 150 mya, prior to speciation of Homo sapiens.The vertebrate genome is filled (> 50%) with repeat sequences, including interspersed repeats derived from transposable elements (LINEs carrying SINEs on their back), and long genomic regions that duplicate in tandem, palindromic or dispersed fashion.These include duplicated segments, at which mispairing during recombination creates deletions responsible for genetic syndromes (Ostertag & Kazazian 2001).Both kDNA and host DNA are rearranged: the kDNA insertions and host flanking regions are subject to the consequences of deletion and rearrangement.Therefore, genomic DNA samples  showing horizontal transfer of minicircles into host vertebrate genome are useful laboratory tools for the calibration of molecular clocks.Complete genome sequencing from an archetype Chagas patient with deletions and recombination resulting from kDNA integrations would give a unique opportunity to advance research in this field.

(p31.5) The chicken genome database has been completed and its annotation is available.There are over 200,000 copies of the repetitive retrotransposon CR-1 (equivalent to LINE-1 of mammals) in chicken, about twice the amount found in mammals.In addition approximately 10,000 SINE matches were found, similar to mammals (International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium 2004).
