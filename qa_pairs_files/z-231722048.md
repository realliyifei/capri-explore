## (s2) Results
(p2.0) A total of 956 articles were identified at the databases and 6 articles from the references of the selected articles that met the inclusion criteria. After excluding duplicates and reading the titles and abstracts, 94 articles were potentially eligible and selected for full reading. Seventy-six articles were excluded, resulting in a total of 18 articles selected according to the eligibility criteria ( Figure 1). e flowchart presents the process of selecting studies according to the items of PRISMA [26].
## (s8) Impact of the Association between Asthma and DM2 for
(p8.0) Asthma Control. Glycemic changes [20], diagnosis of longstanding diabetes [39], diabetic microangiopathy [20], and inflammation [37,38] were identified as important characteristics for the loss of asthma control when associated with T2DM from reading the 5 studies included in the analysis of this category.

(p8.1) A prospective study by Wytrychowski et al. demonstrated that the hyperglycemia that accompanies systemic treatment with corticosteroids hinders recovering from the acute exacerbation of asthma that requires hospitalization and prolonging hospital stay compared to patients who do not have glucose metabolism disorders. e authors conclude that hyperglycemia is a factor that significantly increases the length of hospital stay for exacerbation of asthma, regardless of the mode of insulin therapy [21].

(p8.2) Another study, evaluating diabetic patients and nondiabetic controls who were hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbation (72%) or COPD (28%), showed that an exacerbation of prediagnosed diabetes contributed 3 times more to long-term mortality in individuals with asthma and concomitant obstructive diseases than glycemic changes during hospitalization. e authors argue that a history of diabetes, but not hyperglycemia during the exacerbation of the obstructive pulmonary disease, has an impact on long-term mortality but does not make explicit the pathophysiology involved with the outcome of this study [39].

(p8.3) Confirming those findings, a multicenter and observational study with cross-sectional analysis showed that Hispanics/Latinos aged 18 to 74 years with pulmonary disease (asthma, bronchitis, and COPD) and T2DM had mean values of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), lower forced vital capacity (FVC), and higher mean dyspnea scores than those without T2DM, regardless of age, sex, and smoking. e authors conclude that intrinsic biological changes in the lung related to diabetic microangiopathy cause pulmonary symptoms and dysfunction, which may contribute to general morbidity and mortality from lung diseases [21].

(p8.4) Veryomenko and Beztitko, studying the patients with moderately severe uncontrolled asthma and concomitant DM2, proved that the decrease in inflammatory markers and BMI reduced HbAlc and the level of glycemic load in the intervention group, improving asthma control by the Asthma Control Questionnaire by 21% [37]. A similar result was found by Li et al. when analyzing the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin in asthma control. e findings of this study confirm that the reduction in airway inflammation, provided by the use of metformin, contributed to a lower risk of exacerbation and hospitalizations for asthma when associated with T2DM [38].
