## (s4) Results
(p4.0) The articles selected for inclusion in this review were identified using PubMed, which resulted in a total of 194 items published from 1 January 2008 to 31 March 2023.Following an initial review, 44 articles met the inclusion criteria.A full text review of each of the 44 articles was conducted followed by team discussions based on the inclusion criteria and research questions.Of the total 44 articles included in this literature review, 19 were quantitative studies, 9 were qualitative studies, 5 were mixed methods studies, 2 were systematic reviews, and 9 were theoretical papers such as literature and/or policy reviews, commentaries, and clinical opinions.More than half of the empirical studies (66%) included in this paper were published from 2020 to 2023, 10 to 13 years from the passage of the comprehensive healthcare reform (ACA) into law [42], while theoretical papers were more common on or before 2020, or within the first 10 years of ACA.See Table 1.The subsequent tables present data to address the study objectives as identified at the end of the introduction.Specifically, Table 2 provides information on patient population demographics and health conditions underpinning SDH clinical assessments, Table 3 lists various SDH screening tools used in clinical settings, Table 4 identifies various reasons for SDH integration, and finally, Supplementary Materials Table S1 lists the study design of the articles included in this review, method of integration, type of healthcare facility and its geographic location.SDH assessments in clinical settings focused primarily on vulnerable, disadvantaged, at-risk, and/or socially isolated patients.These patients came from communities experiencing persistent socio-economic challenges, material deprivation, food insecurity, housing instability, and/or toxic stress.Incorporating social care into healthcare was frequently carried out in primary care settings within the context of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension; mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and ACEs; and behavioral issues such as smoking or substance use disorders, and cancer screening behavior for breast, colorectal, cervical, or prostate cancer.

(p4.1) The next most common SDH screenings occurred in pediatric settings.Through voluntary self-reported surveys, parents and caregivers provided information regarding their family's social needs and how necessities, such as food, housing, and transportation, affected access to care, duration of hospital stay, and the severity of their child's medical condition.This offered the advantage of obtaining information on the family, as a whole, and understanding the situation they were going through as a collective unit.See Table 2.
