## (s2) | METHODOLOGY
(p2.0) A systematic quantitative literature review (SQLR) was performed following the well established guidelines set out in Pickering and Byrne (2014).A SQLR aims to (1) provide a comprehensive mapping of a field of inquiry; (2) provide an explicit and reproducible method for identifying and selecting literature; (3) summarise the field at the 'big picture' level; (4) extend beyond correlational data while offering a quantitative view of the field; and (5) uncover broader generalisations and limitations of the field.

(p2.1) To be included in the current review, each source had to meet all four of the following criteria: (1) be a journal article or a PhD thesis 3 ; (2) pertain to empirical research that included some aspect of L2 aptitude; (3) employ one of the established and readily available instruments for measuring L2 aptitude 4 ; and (4) be published in English. 5 Original research papers and theses presenting empirical studies were obtained from the following scholarly electronic databases: Eric, JSTOR, ProQuest, SAGE, Web of Science and Wiley. 6Searches were periodically conducted across all the databases between May 7, 2016 and August 24, 2020.

(p2.2) For each database, the same keyword search was employed (see Table 2).Keywords from column 1, which identify L2-aptitude-specific measures and tests, were combined with the keywords from column 2, which delimit the field of research to second language learning.The keyword phrases in Table 2 are written exactly as they were used in the keyword search.For example, the first search for each database was constructed by combining keywords from column 1 with keywords from column 2, for example ("modern language aptitude test" OR "MLAT") AND ("second language learning" OR "second language acquisition" OR "foreign language learning").

(p2.3) Based on the guidelines in Pickering and Byrne (2014), the following data categories were created: publication details, geographical information, research methods used, participant demographic information, and variables measured.Data were extracted from each paper according to the categories and definitions detailed in Appendix A.
## (s6) | RESULTS
(p6.0) Following Pickering and Byrne's (2014) guidelines, the results of the review are structured as follows.We first consider the publication details, with a focus on journals, types of publication, and authors most prevalent in L2 aptitude research.We then explore the geographical spread of L2 aptitude research, looking at the institutional affiliation of the researchers conducting the studies as well as the sites of data collection.Demographic information about participants in L2 aptitude studies is considered, followed by a discussion of the research methods used in the original studies.Finally, we summarise key trends, challenges and future research directions.
## (s22) | Reporting practices are patchy
(p22.0) Participants in this research are poorly understood, as the reporting of their background characteristics is inconsistent.If the background characteristics across samples are unknown, then true comparisons are not possible and thus meta-analyses would be unfeasible based on these data.This challenge, in turn, compromises the interpretability of the results.For example, socioeconomic status is considered an important variable in educational outcomes (Reardon et al., 2014), yet only 16.2% of all studies report on this variable.Additionally, less than 60% of the studies reported on previous language learning experience, despite findings that suggest this experience influences L2 aptitude test scores (Rogers et al., 2017).More research is needed to better understand which background factors are relevant in studying L2 aptitude (Rogers et al., 2016(Rogers et al., , 2017)).

(p22.1) Increases in the consistency and details of reporting background characteristics of participants would be especially useful if L2 aptitude research expands beyond the current focus on L1 English-speaking, high-school and university aged students in North America.From our SQLR on L2 aptitude research we can see that the field is of primary interest to SLA researchers, as most studies have been published in language learning focused journals (see Figure 2), which is understandable given the original motivation of the field.Moreover, the field of L2 aptitude research appears to be a fractured one, with little consensus or long-term research agendas.Notable exceptions in the period under review are Sparks, Ganschow and their colleagues.

(p22.2) Curiously, the fracturing of the field is further evidenced by the fact that individual researchers who have published PhD theses on L2 aptitude do not appear to have published subsequent research articles in the field.This suggests that most researchers do not focus on L2 aptitude itself, but rather include L2 aptitude as one of the variables of interest in their studies.
## (s23) | Research on L2 aptitude is overwhelmingly quantitative
(p23.0) The SQLR makes it clear that, methodologically, L2 aptitude studies are overwhelmingly quantitative, focusing on comparing L2 aptitude scores with other predictors of L2 achievement.The data are thus correlational, examining statistical relationships between aggregated measures of L2 aptitude, L2 achievement, and to some extent intelligence, attitudes and motivation.

(p23.1) Although L2 aptitude research tended to focus on aggregate scores for a battery of tests, more recent research examines specific tests addressing one area of L2 aptitude to explain outcomes in specific areas of L2 learning.Coextensive with this recent research tendency is the increasing use of a range of L2 aptitude tests other than the MLAT.The most well-known of these are the LLAMA tests, which are free and computer-based (Rogers et al., 2017), although a range of other tests also exist.Notably, the development of new L2 aptitude tests is only partially captured in our review.The most prominent of these is the Hi-LAB (Doughty, 2014), which purports to predict high levels of L2 ultimate attainment with tests that measure various aspects of memory (with a particular focus on working memory), implicit learning, processing speed and auditory perceptual acuity (see also Linck et al., 2013).Significantly, all these new measures in L2 aptitude testing continue to be quantitative, reflecting the psychometric origins of L2 aptitude research.
