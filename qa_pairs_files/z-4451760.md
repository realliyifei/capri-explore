## (s5) The difference hierarchy of the polynomial closure of a lattice
(p5.0) A language L of A * is a marked product of the languages L 0 , L 1 , . . . , L n if L = L 0 a 1 L 1 · · · a n L n for some letters a 1 , . . . , a n of A. Given a set L of languages, the polynomial closure of L is the set of languages that are finite unions of marked products of languages of L. The polynomial closure of L is denoted Pol L and the Boolean closure of Pol L is denoted BPol L. Finally, let co-Pol L denote the set of complements of languages in Pol L. In this section, we are interested in the difference hierarchy induced by Pol L. We consider several examples. The syntactic characterization of piecewise testable languages follows from a much deeper result of Simon [27].
## (s8) Cyclic and strongly cyclic regular languages
(p8.0) Cyclic and strongly cyclic regular languages are two classes of regular languages related to symbolic dynamic and first studied in [1]. It was shown in [5] that an appropriate notion of chains suffices to characterise the difference hierarchy based on the class of strongly cyclic regular languages. This contrasts with Section 7, in which the general results on chain did not lead to a full characterization of difference hierarchies.

(p8.1) Let A = (Q, A, ·) be a finite (possibly incomplete) deterministic automaton. A word u stabilises a subset P of Q if P ·u = P . Given a subset P of Q, let Stab(P ) be the set of all words that stabilise P . The language Stab(A) that stabilises A is by definition the set of all words which stabilise at least one nonempty subset of Q.  One can show that the set of strongly cyclic languages of A * forms a lattice of languages but is not closed under quotients. For instance, as shown in Example 9.2, the language L = (b + aa) * + (ab * a) * + a * is strongly cyclic, but Corollary 9.9 will show that its quotient b −1 L = (b + aa) * is not strongly cyclic, since aa ∈ (b + aa) * but a / ∈ (b + aa) * . We will also need the following characterization [1, Proposition 7]: Proposition 9.3. Let A = (Q, A, E) be a deterministic automaton. A word u belongs to Stab(A) if and only if there is some state q of A such that for every integer n, the transition q · u n exists.
