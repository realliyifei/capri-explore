CorpusID: 264297555 - [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b86b5d8c8cadf1d8c2b2ecc94bf4fdea52124836](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b86b5d8c8cadf1d8c2b2ecc94bf4fdea52124836)

Fields: Medicine

## (s2) Registration and protocol
(p2.0) The protocol design of this study followed the Cochrane Handbook (Huang et al., 2020d) and was registered in the PROSPERO database.We reported this overview in accordance with the PRIOR statement (Gates et al., 2022).

LLM judge: NO

Violations of criteria: 
2. The content is merely a statement about the protocol design and registration of the study, lacking deeper context or explanation.
3. The content includes references to other papers without providing further details or explanations.

Other issues:
The content lacks specific details about the study, such as the research question, methods, or findings.

## (s4) Study selection
(p4.0) The titles and abstracts of all citations found through the literature search were independently examined by two reviewers.The selection criteria were then applied after retrieving studies that might be pertinent and reviewing and include any relevant references.The PICOS criteria of the present overview were as follows: (a) population: patients diagnosed with IBS by Rome III (Drossman, 2006), or Rome IV (Drossman, 2016); (b) intervention: FMT by any route of administration and any dosage; (c) comparison: placebo (autologous transfer, excipients with no microbiota); (d) outcome: reported improvement in global IBS symptoms, IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), QoL, also the adverse events of the intervention; (e) design: SRs/MAs only included randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

LLM judge: YES

## (s8) Certainty of the evidence
(p8.0) The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system (Pollock et al., 2016) was applied by two authors independently to evaluate certainty of the evidence.The GRADE method evaluates limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, and reporting bias.The certainty of the evidence can be qualified as very low quality, low quality, moderate quality, and high quality.

LLM judge: YES

## (s16) Discussion
(p16.0) Evidence from high quality sources tends to prioritize SR/MAs (Yang et al., 2019;Pan et al., 2023).However, the evidence is complex and sometimes redundant, misleading, and conflicting, which may be attributed to the different methodological qualities and reporting behavior of SRs/MAs (Huang et al., 2021b;Huang et al., 2022a;Huang et al., 2022b).Under the circumstances, a systematic overview of these SRs/MAs is urgent needed.In addition, an overview can provide current deficiencies to improve and guide future high-quality SRs/MAs.

LLM judge: YES
