## (s3) Mechanism of Thermoregulation in Poultry
(p3.0) Poultry is warm-blooded, meaning it can maintain a constant body temperature despite changes in ambient temperature [52].Poultry begins to exhibit behavioral responses to expel excess heat, as shown in Figure 2. The cooling mechanism in poultry can be divided into four processes: (1) Conduction processes, for example, being in contact with the floor, planks, sidewalls, and cage floors inside the house [53][54][55] with a temperature lower than the animal's body temperature, which causes internal body heat to flow along the surface.
## (s14) Conventional Method
(p14.0) Mating between high-yielding chicken breeds and native chicken breeds for the benefit of environmental adaptation and heat tolerance is a method that is widely used in many countries [110,111], but it may make purebred chickens more productive.The number of purebred chickens is steadily decreasing, which may not be suitable for animal genetic stability.At the same time, the temperature and humidity, which are calculated as the temperature-humidity index (THI), are used to assess the heat stress threshold for which performance and production begin to decline and to regress phenotypic performance on the THI value to quantify the genetic parameters of thermotolerance.The identification and selection of heat-tolerant animals is an important strategy for minimizing the effects of heat stress on dairy cattle productivity [112,113].Thus, it is crucial to include heat adaptive parameters in the selection objective of dairy cow populations.Traditional models for describing an animal's production performance in response to increased heat stress, known as the broken line (BL) model, assume that production does not change in the thermoneutral zone, and after the threshold point, production decreases linearly [114].An alternative is to model the animal's productive response using a reaction norm that uses polynomials.This approach offers higher flexibility than the BL [115].In poultry, THI that exceeds a particular threshold for poultry often leads to significant declines in feed intake and body weight, lowered fertility, and a significant increase in mortality rate and physiological response.Boonkum et al. [50] estimated the impact of heat stress on the genetic absolute growth rate (AGR) in Thai native chickens and Thai synthetic chickens (chickens that have undergone genetic enhancement through the crossbreeding of commercial chickens with indigenous chicken breeds) and found a THI of 76.Compared to that of native Thai chickens, Thai synthetic chickens' growth rate decreased more dramatically.Additionally, Loengbudnark et al. [51] investigated the effects of heat stress on the

[51] investigated the effects of heat stress on the genetics of monthly eggs and found that monthly egg production started to decrease when the THI was 74.
## (s18) OMICS Technology
(p18.0) Several omics studies have been conducted in poultry to investigate the molecular mechanisms and genetic responses associated with heat stress (Figure 3).These studies have utilized genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other omics approaches to gain insights into the physiological and molecular changes that occur in response to heat stress in poultry (Table 4).Genomic studies have examined the genetic variations and genomic regions associated with heat tolerance in poultry.These studies have involved genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or genomic selection approaches to identify candidate genes or genetic markers associated with heat tolerance traits [149].Transcriptomic analyses have been used to investigate gene expression changes in response to heat stress in poultry.These studies have identified heat stress-responsive genes, pathways, and regulatory networks involved in thermoregulation, immune response, oxidative stress, metabolism, and other relevant processes.Transcriptomic data have been generated using microarray technology or next-generation sequencing techniques, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) [150].Proteomic studies have examined the changes in protein expression, posttranslational modifications, and protein-protein interactions in response to heat stress in poultry.These studies have identified heat shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes, and other proteins involved in stress responses and cellular defense mechanisms.Mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches have been employed to profile protein expression patterns under heat stress conditions [151].Metabolomic analyses have been used to investigate the metabolic changes and alterations in metabolite profiles associated with heat stress in poultry.Metabolomics studies have revealed changes in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and other metabolic pathways in response to heat stress.Metabolites have been analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique (LC-MS) [142].These omics studies have provided valuable insights into poultry's molecular and physiological responses to heat stress.They have helped identify potential biomarkers, pathways, and genetic markers associated with heat tolerance, which can inform breeding programs aimed at developing more thermotolerant poultry breeds and improving management strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of heat stress in poultry production.
