## (s1) REVIEW
(p1.0) A cross-sectional study was conducted on tibiofemoral osteoarthritis impact on standard of living as well as functioning in elderly Koreans, with women suffering more than men. The objective was to look at the effect of osteoarthritis of the knee on standard of living, functioning, and lower limb physical ability in older Korean community members, as well as the gender differences. The individuals were all from the population-based Hallym ageing study (HAS), with an average age of 70.4 years with 274 (54 percent) of them being female. Several lower limb physical performance tests were performed, including standing balance, a 6-meter typical walk, and 5 repetitive chair stands. The individuals were instructed to try to maintain their legs in side-by-side, semi-tandem, as well as tandem positions for 10 secs each to assess their standing balance. Across all 3 trials, female OA participants had considerably lower functional groupings than female non-OA responses, whereas males exhibited no substantial variation between OA and non-OA individuals. They concluded that knee OA has a detrimental impact on QoL and physical performance in both men and women, although women being more severely impacted than males. The sitting-to-standing test was used in this study to assess the risk of falling and balance difficulties in knee OA individuals [13].
