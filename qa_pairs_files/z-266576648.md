## (s1) C. METHOD
(p1.0) This article used eight steps of systematic literature review developed by Okoli (2015).The first step was to identify the objective of the SLR, describing the trend of coordination studies in the public sector published from 2010 to 2021.The selection of the period is meant to expose the situation surrounding coordination throughout the second decade of the 21 st century.However, the authors deliberately expanded the period to one more year to cover the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and started to be discussed in 2021.The pandemic has made a significant addition to the coordination contexts.Figure 1 presents the systematic literature review protocol as a standard guideline in this study.In this study, the agreed protocol was that a search was conducted on articles published in the 2010-2021 period in Scopus-indexed journals.The investigation was limited to the Scopus database to ensure that only papers with the best technical, substantive editing quality and rigorous findings would be reviewed.The search was performed using keywords of 'coordination', 'joined-up government', 'inter-governmental relation', and 'whole of government' and Boolean operator 'OR', with the subject area limited to social sciences.The collected articles were only original and review articles, excluding those in the conference proceedings book.The initial screening stage resulted in 3,710 articles.The next screening was done by limiting publication outlets to journals in English language focusing on public policy and public administration, resulting in 174 pieces.Next, the 174 articles were chosen based on their relevance to coordinating government policies and programs and their classification as original research papers, determined by analyzing the abstract.The final result was 87 articles.To answer the research questions, the aspects represented as the sample characteristics were the sectors predominantly studied, the focus of the study, the geographical distribution of studies, the distribution of authors, and the relationship between coordination problems and the use of technology.

(p1.1) Furthermore, the review questions proposed identified the factors driving coordination, coordination instruments, and critical factors for coordination success.Coding on the first aspect was applied to identify coordination drivers and precise reasons to coordinate.For the second theme, coding was used to discern mechanisms in the discussed cases, including those that culminated in failure.As for the latter piece, the coding process involved isolating the factors identified by the authors of the reviewed articles.Findings were further categorized within each theme to show the distinctive characteristics of coordination issues during the selected period.
## (s3) Public Service in the Pandemic Era
(p3.0) From 2010 to 2021, an average of 7.9 research articles on 'coordination' were published annually in Scopus-indexed journals.The number of research publications related to 'coordination' peaked in 2015 with seventeen articles, exhibiting an increase in the number of publications in the previous year (12 articles and above the average).This relatively small yet consistently stable number indicates that coordination-related research remains relevant for public administration researchers.

(p3.1) Graph 1. Number of Articles Published from 2010 to 2021 Among the existing publication channels, the International Journal of Public Administration (with seventeen articles), the International Review of Administrative Sciences (twelve), the Public Organization Review (eight), and the Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis (six) are among the top four journals publishing research articles on the topic of 'coordination'.These four journals have published nearly half of the 87 original articles studied in this review.In total, 24 journals publish articles related to 'coordination', with most journals based in Europe.Table 2 reveals that the prevalence of European-based journals has resulted in a predominant focus on coordination cases within European countries.Of the 87 articles, 48 (55.2%) addressed coordination cases in European countries.Among these European countries, the United Kingdom and Norway emerge as central research hubs related to coordination.The prominence of the articles addressing cases in the United Kingdom cannot be separated from the origination of the term joined-up government, popularized by the Labor Party during the premiership of Tony Blair.In total, ten articles specifically address coordination cases in the UK.In the case of Norway, out of nine articles explicitly addressing issues in Norway, eight are co-authored by Tom Christensen and Per Laegreid.One report was also co-authored by Laegreid with other researchers, leaving just one article unattributed to either of them.It indicates their expertise in studies on the topic of 'coordination'.

(p3.2) In addition to case studies in a particular country, comparative studies between countries were also prevalent.Thirteen articles fall into the category of comparative studies, with seven comparing two countries and the remainder examining coordination practices across three or more countries.Most of these comparative studies were conducted within a single continent, such as in Europe or Asia only.However, the article by Liu et al. (2021) and another by Jayaraman et al. (2016) compare coordination practices in two countries on different continents.
## (s4) Drivers for Coordination
(p4.0) Wegrich and Štimac (2014) state that the coordination issue originated in functional differentiation within a government, creating an overlap or overlap between work units or government agencies.Both overlap and underlap to 'siloisation' (Samaratunge et al., 2017) or a tendency for officials in the bureaucracy to focus only on the performance of their respective agencies rather than the performance of cross-cutting programs.Implementing these crossboundary policies and programs is challenging due to the number and diversity of parties and aspirations involved (Carey & Harris, 2015).This difficulty is exacerbated by the wave of gentrification promoted by the New Public Management (NPM).The increasingly prominent challenge for coordination triggers the post-NPM agendas to encourage administrative integration (Reiter & Klenk, 2019).

(p4.1) Overlap and underlap, however, will continue to exist in various forms and degrees as each organization decentralizes, departmentalizes, or differentiates functionally to a certain degree per their respective assessments and needs.Several conditions amplify the necessity for coordination within the reviewed articles.While not all articles provide comprehensive elaborations on these conditions, the drivers for coordination can be categorized, as summarized in Table 4.
## (s5) Institutionsdriven
(p5.0) Fragmented decision-making authority Conflicting goals Rules Diffused performance targets (Andersson, 2022;Christensen et al., 2014;Del Río, 2014;Holt et al., 2018;Naidoo, 2013) Coordination can arise from existing problem situations, regardless of an organization's responsiveness, the institutional design that forces coordination, or a combination of these factors.Among the problems prompting inter-coordination, several articles highlight issues related to transboundary crises, such as environmental pollution, terrorism, or economic concerns.These crises are 'wicked problems' although the former tends to be temporary while the latter may include prolonged problems, such as poverty or gender inequality (Carayannopoulos & McConnell, 2018).Wicked problems catalyze coordination as they engender a shared understanding among agencies.The third problem situation that encourages coordination is international pressure.International pressure can be caused by international regulations (as in the case of European Union countries) or pressure from agreements (e.g., targets in the Sustainable Development Goals).Finally, a scarcity of resources is also a problem situation necessitating coordination, forcing an organization to coordinate or join up with other organizations.

(p5.1) In terms of institutional settings, the tendency of fragmentation of authority for decisionmaking, either vertically or horizontally, compels an institution to inevitably coordinate with other institutions, especially in dealing with issues requiring input from different institutions.In addition, the existence of conflicting goals in policymaking has the potential to create ambiguity in policy implementation.A policy designed with conflicting goals will naturally require synchronization at the operational level and specific on-the-ground measures (Howlett, 2018).This synchronization is achieved through coordination between related agencies.The third source of institutional setting that induces coordination is regulations designed to prevent policies from being devised or implemented in silos.However, rules have the potential to render coordination a mere formality.Finally, performance management constructed using diffused performance targets serves as a driver for inter-unit and inter-agency coordination.The achievement of these performance targets forces units and institutions to coordinate.However, in practice, leaders of institutions will often only focus on and prioritize the performance targets of their institutions (Samaratunge et al., 2017).
