## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) While it is established that meticulous oral hygiene instructions play a key role in decreasing the risks linked with removable partial dentures, the inherent capability of removable partial dentures to hold dental plaque is still considered a chief risk factor and might explain the latest link between the recommendation of partial dentures and the progress of periodontitis around the abutment teeth [1,2]. This should encourage dental researchers to develop material with low abilities for plaque adhesion.

(p0.1) The other adverse effects of a partial denture as a result of plaque buildup is the progress of severe inflammation ( Fig. 1) of the underlying tissues developing to denture stomatitis, or as an outcome of direct trauma to the gums and other soft tissues might lead to bleeding and bad mouth odor [3].
