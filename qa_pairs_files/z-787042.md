(p30.0) Positional nystagmus upon SHH was reported in 22 (26.7%) patients (6,16,26,31,33), with 17 (77.3%) exclusively positional downbeating (pDBN) (4, 6, 16, 31), 4 (18.2%) downbeating with rotatory component (4), and 1 (4.5%) horizontal with rotatory component (33).

(p30.3) Positional nystagmus upon SHH was reported in 22 (26.7%) patients (6,16,26,31,33), with 17 (77.3%) exclusively positional downbeating (pDBN) (4, 6, 16, 31), 4 (18.2%) downbeating with rotatory component (4), and 1 (4.5%) horizontal with rotatory component (33).
## (s39) Direction
(p39.0) It is noteworthy that only 2 (2.4%) patients within the data set reported the presence of spontaneous nystagmus (12,25). This minimized the potential influence of the well-known phenomenon that a discrete spontaneous downbeat nystagmus, which may not be visible under Frenzel glasses, becomes only evident by positioning the patient. While it is proposed that a central origin has to be assumed for pure upbeat, downbeat, and torsional nystagmus (1), we found that in about a one-third of cases (29.9%), CPN was a mixture of horizontal, torsional, and vertical components in variable combinations depending on the positioning maneuver performed. Furthermore, the direction of CPN is not always "atypical" for the plane of the canal being stimulated, since downbeat nystagmus was the most prominent direction during SHH (in 77.3%) while pHN was most prominent upon supine head turning (in 80.5%). Theoretically, a symmetrical bilateral p-BPPV could lead to paroxysmal upbeat nystagmus during coactivation of both posterior semicircular canals in the SHH position. For HC-BPPV, the nystagmus that occurs when the left ear or right ear is in the down position can be directed to the undermost (geotropic) or uppermost (apogeotropic) ear (1). Thus, this feature (geotropic or apogeotropic) cannot be used to differentiate a peripheral or central origin.

(p39.1) Only one patient had a positive D-H with the direction of nystagmus characteristic of BPPV (31) but failed to respond to repositioning treatments, and later developed ataxia. Cho and colleagues (26) presented three patients who, except for apogeotropic PN during supine roll tests, had normal neurological examinations. After an initial diagnosis of BPPV, canalith repositioning maneuvers were applied repeatedly but without success, and the patients were later found to have central lesions. These cases highlight the importance of considering central causes of PN when presumed BPPV is refractory to treatment.

## (s43) Associated Features of CPN
(p43.0) Central positional vomiting refers to the presence of vomiting triggered by a positioning maneuver and was reported in 15 (out of 18 participants on whom the symptom was commented upon). A positive reporting bias, therefore, could not be excluded. Central positional vomiting may occur in the absence of nystagmus or vertigo (40,41). This review found that vomiting almost always occurred in the presence of vertigo in a variety of space occupying lesions. The cause of vomiting may be due to lesionrelated pressure effects on the area postrema in the caudal aspect of the floor for the fourth ventricle (33), or related to affectation of cerebellar and brainstem pathways involved in the integration of vestibular and non-vestibular afferents relating to body position in space (42).

(p43.1) In several papers, especially those from otolaryngology settings, it is not clear to what extent a thorough neurological examination had been conducted and whether neurological symptoms/signs were under-reported. Bertholon et al. (7) found that CPN was not an isolated oculomotor finding in 10 out of 12 (83%) patients with confirmed CNS pathologies (7). In these cases, CPN was associated with gaze-evoked nystagmus and/or abnormal smooth pursuit. A majority of patients (60.9%) with CPN had associated neurological symptoms, most commonly gait unsteadiness, and neurological signs, including gaze-evoked nystagmus and ataxia.

This minimized the potential influence of the well-known phenomenon that a discrete spontaneous downbeat nystagmus, which may not be visible under Frenzel glasses, becomes only evident by positioning the patient. While it is proposed that a central origin has to be assumed for pure upbeat, downbeat, and torsional nystagmus (1), we found that in about a one-third of cases (29.9%), CPN was a mixture of horizontal, torsional, and vertical components in variable combinations depending on the positioning maneuver performed. Furthermore, the direction of CPN is not always "atypical" for the plane of the canal being stimulated, since downbeat nystagmus was the most prominent direction during SHH (in 77.3%) while pHN was most prominent upon supine head turning (in 80.5%). Theoretically, a symmetrical bilateral p-BPPV could lead to paroxysmal upbeat nystagmus during coactivation of both posterior semicircular canals in the SHH position. For HC-BPPV, the nystagmus that occurs when the left ear or right ear is in the down position can be directed to the undermost (geotropic) or uppermost (apogeotropic) ear (1). Thus, this feature (geotropic or apogeotropic) cannot be used to differentiate a peripheral or central origin.

(p149.1) Only one patient had a positive D-H with the direction of nystagmus characteristic of BPPV (31) but failed to respond to repositioning treatments, and later developed ataxia. Cho and colleagues (26) presented three patients who, except for apogeotropic PN during supine roll tests, had normal neurological examinations. After an initial diagnosis of BPPV, canalith repositioning maneuvers were applied repeatedly but without success, and the patients were later found to have central lesions. These cases highlight the importance of considering central causes of PN when presumed BPPV is refractory to treatment.

(p149.2) It is noteworthy that only 2 (2.4%) patients within the data set reported the presence of spontaneous nystagmus (12,25).

## (s153) Associated Features of CPN
(p153.0) Central positional vomiting refers to the presence of vomiting triggered by a positioning maneuver and was reported in 15 (out of 18 participants on whom the symptom was commented upon). A positive reporting bias, therefore, could not be excluded. Central positional vomiting may occur in the absence of nystagmus or vertigo (40,41). This review found that vomiting almost always occurred in the presence of vertigo in a variety of space occupying lesions. The cause of vomiting may be due to lesionrelated pressure effects on the area postrema in the caudal aspect of the floor for the fourth ventricle (33), or related to affectation of cerebellar and brainstem pathways involved in the integration of vestibular and non-vestibular afferents relating to body position in space (42).

(p153.1) In several papers, especially those from otolaryngology settings, it is not clear to what extent a thorough neurological examination had been conducted and whether neurological symptoms/signs were under-reported. Bertholon et al. (7) found that CPN was not an isolated oculomotor finding in 10 out of 12 (83%) patients with confirmed CNS pathologies (7). In these cases, CPN was associated with gaze-evoked nystagmus and/or abnormal smooth pursuit. A majority of patients (60.9%) with CPN had associated neurological symptoms, most commonly gait unsteadiness, and neurological signs, including gaze-evoked nystagmus and ataxia.
