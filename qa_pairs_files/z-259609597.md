## (s16) CHALLENGES OF SMART LOGISTICS
(p16.0) Smart logistics depends hugely on the availability and accessibility of information. Ding et al. (2020) contend that the more advanced information technologies available, the greater the chances of developing better communication technologies and management systems. Therefore, information availability, accessibility, and flow determine how well a smart logistics system operates. Any threat to the crucial information will affect the efficacy of smart logistics to deliver on its roles within a company or in the supply chain system. Making sure that all the necessary information is available will prevent any losses and increase the performance of the supply chain system and the organization at large. Since smart logistics is becoming increasingly complex, given that more parties are getting involved both directly and indirectly in supply chains, blockchain is emerging as a solution. As noted by Armugam et al. (2018), the following are some challenges, which include transparency, traceability, accountability, and liability, as explained below.
