## (s1) A. LEARNING FROM UNSTRUCTURED DATA
(p1.0) Graph neural networks are powerful mathematical tools for knowledge representation, able to encode structured and unstructured information in a convenient fashion, through nodes which model entities (objects, functional elements, robots), and edges that encode their spatial, temporal or functional relationship.Graphs are commonly used to model a variety of different elements, such as molecules [1] for drug discovery, physics simulations [2], scientific citations [3] or social networks [4].In computer vision, this architecture has emerged as a promising tool to deal with data that lie on irregular domains, such as point clouds [5], [6], to uncover non-local similarities in the data [7], and video understanding [8], [9].

(p1.1) Thanks to these promising results, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained the attention of the robotic community, being proposed as key technological solutions for more and more new tasks and applications.As noticeable exam-

(p1.2) Schematics of the information representation encoded in the form of images, text and graphs.Although being by far the most common data structures to train artificial neural architectures, images and ordered series of tokens cannot handle unstructured data distribution.To address this challenge, graph structures constitute the primary mathematical representation for an efficient and effective data representation.

(p1.3) ples, it is worth mentioning grasping and manipulation, in which robots are usually tasked to process as input threedimensional data, for which graphs can be used to provide an efficient yet effective modelling tool.Another relevant scenario is the use of graph architectures to capture and model spatial and functional keypoints of environments or workspaces, allowing robots to better understand the environment wherein, how to interact safely with objects and zones, and how to plan meaningful tasks.
## (s4) II. PRELIMINARIES ON GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS
(p4.0) In the last few years, learning on graph structures has gained significant relevance in the community, thanks to their intrinsic capability to easily process data lying on irregular domains, such as three-dimensional point clouds, spatiotemporal and functional relationships [14]- [17].Similarly to what Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) did for standard images, the community has devoted significant effort in defining convolution-based aggregation mechanisms for graph structures.
## (s7) 2) Spatial Graph Convolutions
(p7.0) As discussed before, an alternative representation of the graph convolution operation may be also formulated in the spatial domain.The filtered signal x i at the i th node is computed as the linear combination of the signal itself and its k-hop local neighbourhood N k (i).The k-hop neighbourhood of node i is defined as the collection of nodes that have the shortest path distance from the i th node less or equal to k.In this survey, we assume the standard practice of considering the 1-hop neighbourhood of a node -if not specified otherwise -and N 1 (i) = N (i).Therefore, it is possible to define the spatial graph filtering as:

(p7.1) where the first part refers to the contribution of the i th node itself, also called self-loop, and the second to the contribution of the surroundings points.The spatial approach shares similar principle ideas with propagation and message passing For each implementation, we report few core characteristics: the type (spectral vs. spatial), how weights are computed, the availability of attributes for edges and a list of relevant papers where these have been used.

(p7.2) of recurrent neural networks, since they both propagate and exchange information within the neighbourhood structure.One of the first message passing models is presented in [3], where the signal function at node i is updated at each time step t with the aggregation of the information, also called messages, from each node j in its neighbourhood.It implements an extension of previous recurrent graph neural networks to more general scenarios, considering different types of graphs.The proposed message passing mechanism can be formulated as follow:

(p7.3) where m is the message passing function, u the update function, F v,i the feature vector associated to the i th node and F e,(i,j) the feature vector associated to the edge that connects nodes i and j.
## (s12) IV. GNNS FOR MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS
(p12.0) In multi-agent systems, an effective coordination and communication between robots is of paramount importance to enable a fruitful cooperation, which is clearly critical for several downstream tasks.Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by exploiting centralised approaches, where all the intelligence and computation complexity is centralised on a common controller node, which collects information from the environment, plan and then communicate single actions to each robot to fulfil the desired task.Such an approach has the strong benefit of having a central control system able to reason on the current (and past) status of the whole set of agents and the surrounding environment, thus requiring only little computation on the device side for action execution.However, this approach has a low fault tolerance: if even a single agent fails, all the actions of the robots need to be recomputed.Centralised solutions also badly scale with the increase of agents, and for difficult tasks it even requires additional per-robot computation [133].

(p12.1) To address these issues, recently many researchers devoted their attention to decentralised approaches, where each agent learns its set of actions according to environmental data and shared information from other agents.In this configuration, each robot has to deal with limited observability due to the range of the sensors, each robot can only see a partial portion of the environment and can communicate with the nearest agents.GNNs offer generalized and flexible structural representations of the elements in multi-robot systems, and have been recently widely used in decentralised approaches to adress several tasks.
## (s14) B. EXPLORATION AND NAVIGATION
(p14.0) In multi-robot exploration, a team of robots needs to explore an unknown environment and additionally visit several regions of interest.In such a scenario, it is particularly important the communication and cooperation between agents to efficiently cover the exploration ground, and avoid conflicts or repeated explorations.Furthermore, in order to success- fully fulfil the task, a key aspect is to define the spatial relationship between robots and regions of interest and extract environmental information.Graph neural networks provide a promising tool to efficiently regulate the communication between agents and aggregate topological information from the environment.

(p14.1) In section IV, we reviewed several approaches that build a communication graph for multi-robot systems coordination, which can be also applied for exploration tasks [43], [134]- [142].Some of these works, instead, are specifically designed for the task of exploration, such as [142] where the authors tackle the task of coverage control, with the aim of predicting the distribution of a set of robots in a region such that the likelihood to spot events of interest is maximised.Of relevance is also [138], where the communication graph between several agents and a data sink is used to prevent data loss and allow robots to explore the environment efficiently in the presence of intermittent connectivity, for instance in space exploration.

(p14.2) It is also relevant to mention a line of research where graphs are used to model together both the environment and the agents therein.For the sake of completeness, we first introduce some relevant works which target this problem for single-robot exploration.In [10], [11], [39] the authors propose an exploration graph to predict the next action [39], further extended with the addition of deep reinforcement learning to learn robot policies [10], [11].The model provides a general representation of the SLAM-dependent robot state and environment, creating a spatio-temporal graph where robot state, landmarks, and frontiers are encoded as nodes, and a graph neural network is used to extract meaningful features from the environment.Topological graphs can be also used to model an entire environment, such as in [153], where the graph is used to model an indoor space for mobile robot exploration.The idea of processing environmental information is then later extended also to multi-robot exploration [12], [145], [146].In [12], the authors propose to segment the exploration environment into the graph domain.To do this, the map is divided into regions and each of them is mapped into a node of the graph, while edges between nodes represent spatial distance.Based on the topological graph, a graph-based reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to learn how to assign exploration targets to each robot.Instead, in [145], [146] the authors introduce the use of a spatial graph, where both map locations and agents are represented as nodes, and the connectivity encodes the set of allowed moves.In particular, [146] uses behaviour cloning to train a GNN controller to imitate the expert solution.Such a model can be easily generalised to scenarios with a larger map and more agents.The usage of a GNN allows to easily choose the range in which the exchange of information may happen, by just varying the receptive field of the network.

(p14.3) In [145], Zhang et al. propose a coarse-to-fine exploration framework based on graph neural networks.Depending on the type of exploration, different regions of the environment may have different degree of relevance.As an example, for coarse exploration, the boundary is probably the most relevant zone where to focus, while for a fine inspection, looking to closer regions could be more informative.Graph neural networks can easily reflect such necessity giving more or less importance to features coming from different parts of the graph.
