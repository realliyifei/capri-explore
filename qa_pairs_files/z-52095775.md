## (s2) Anti-Cancer Effect
(p2.0) It is no denying that cancer is one of the major causes of death worldwide; the imbalance and high level of free radicals such as ROS and RNS can also become mutagenic or carcinogenic agents which lead to the cancer development. Chemotherapy is globally employed in cancer treatment, however a large number of drawbacks is its limitation. For example, sometimes the undesired side effects occur during chemotherapeutic treatment. Thus, it is interesting to seek for the alternative treatments for cancer that are no side effects and not so expensive cost. Flavopiridol, a flavonoid-derived drugs from Dysoxylum binectariferum (Roxb.) Hook.f. ex Bedd. [Currently the correct scientific name is Dysoxylum gotadhora (Buch.-Ham.) Mabb. (http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2607025)] is an example of anticancer drugs originated from phytochemical compound for lymphomas and leukemia treatments [33,34]. In addition, dietary supplements also play an important role in preventing and curing various kinds of cancer. Phenolic compounds especially flavonoids have long been reported as chemopreventive agents in cancer therapy [2,17,35,36].

(p2.1) Likewise, Danciu and colleagues researched on the phenolic compounds and biological activities of ethanolic extracts from rhizome of Zingiber officinale Roscoe and Curcuma longa L. which are the core representative species of Zingiberaceae family. This research team proposed the extract of C. longa rhizome as the promising source of natural active compounds to fight against malignant melanoma due to its potential anticancer property on B164A5 murine melanoma cell line. The authors also suggested that the increase in anticancer activity was correlated with the increase in amount of polyphenol compounds [37]. Moreover, the results from many biomedical research teams indicated that various kinds of flavonoids can promote apoptosis in various cancer cells [17,35,38]. Quercetin, a flavonol member, is reported as an interesting anticancer substance against prostate and breast cancers [1,38]. Gliricidin7-O-hexoside and Quercetin 7-O-rutinoside which were the flavonoids isolated from the medicine fern (Asplenium nidus) was also purposed as the potential chemopreventive against human hepatoma HepG2 and human carcinoma HeLa cells [23]. According to the intense studied of Hashemzaei and his research group on quercetin and apoptosis-inducing ability both in vitro and in vivo levels. For in vitro studies, they tested anticancer activity of quercetin in 9 cancer cell lines: prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP cells, colon carcinoma CT-26 cells, pheocromocytoma PC12 cells, human prostate PC3 cells, acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 T-cells, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells, ovarian cancer CHO cells, human myeloma U266B1 cells and human lymphoid Raji cells; the obtained results proved that quercetin can significantly induce apoptosis of every tested cell lines at p < 0.001 comparing with control group [39]. The in vivo experiments conducted in mouse models i.e., mice bearing MCF-7 tumors and mice bearing CT-26 tumors; the quercetin-treated group exhibited a significant decrease in tumor size and volume at p < 0.001 compared to the control group. The survival period of the quercetin-tested animals were also prolonged [39]. Besides, the research team of Clifford conducted their research to evaluate anticancer benefits of quercetin on patient-derived pancreatic tissue and 3 established pancreatic cancer cell lines: primary pancreatic cancer cell line ASANPaCa, AsPC1 and PANC1 to go deeper on the cross talk between quercetin a polyphenol phytochemical compound, microRNAs and Notch signaling in the regulation of self-renewing cancer stem cell divisions [40]. Notch is known as an important gene for signaling receptor encoding, which leads to proper development, the decision of cell fate, cell proliferation and survival [41,42]; it is suggested as a good marker of oncogene and symmetric cell division [43]. Clifford team showed that quercetin can induced miR-200b-3p to regulate the mode of self-renewing divisions of the tested pancreatic cancer [40]. The intense reviewed on genistein and its molecular effects on prostate cancer by Adjakly and his group pointed out that a soy isoflavone genistein inhibited the activation of Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway that is occupied the balance of cell survival and apoptosis, this soy isoflavone could also take its action to fight against cell growth, apoptotic and metastasis processes, including epigenetic modifications in prostate cancer [44]. Curcumin is one of natural phenolic compounds exhibiting anticancer effects towards skin cancers, this phenolic can influence the cell cycle by acting as a pro-apoptotic agent [4]. Abusnina and his team investigated the antiproliferative effect of curcumin on melanoma cancer in in vitro level using B16F10 murine melanoma cells. They showed that curcumin acted as non-selective cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE) inhibitor to inhibit melanoma cell proliferation which is related to epigenetic integrator UHRF1; these researchers also suggested that curcumin occurring in diets might be help to prevent this cancer and contribute in the gene expression via epigenetic control [45]. Interestingly, Hisamitsu group investigated prostate cancer therapeutic potential of curcumin on the inhibitory effect of intracrine androgen synthesis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Their in vitro experiments conducted on human prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells; curcumin decreased the expression of genes evolving in steroidogenic acute regulatory proteins, supporting the decline of testosterone synthesis. Curcumin inhibited proliferation of the selected cell lines in this experiment and induced apoptosis of the cancer cells with dose-dependent response. Their in vivo study on transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model with 1-month oral administration of curcumin displayed that the phytochemical compound regulate the expression of steroidogenic enzyme, including AKR1C2, and suppressed the growth prostate cancer cells by decreasing testosterone levels in prostate tissues of TRAMP mice [46].
## (s3) Cardioprotective Effects
(p3.0) The cardioprotective effects from various kinds of phenolics and/or flavonoids occurring in medicinal plants have been investigated from many researches since many decades ago [1,[47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57]. The comprehensive review of Razavi-Azarkhiavi and his team illustrated cardioprotective role of various phenolic compounds against cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin which is the extensively used anticancer medicine for lymphomas, leukemia and breast cancers in clinical application that contains vulnerable side effect as cardiotoxicity such as pericarditis, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and acute heart failure [52]. They found that antioxidant phenolics have been recommended as a promising approach to reduce adverse effects of this anticancer drug; many phenolic and flavonoid compounds have been studied and reported their cardioprotective properties via various mechanisms including inhibition of ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, NF-kB, p53, and DNA damage both in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. Razavi-Azarkhiavi team also found that many flavonoid and phenolics i.e., kaempferol, rutin, luteolin and resveratrol showed their efficacy against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, but do not affect on the antitumor activity of this medicine [58][59][60]. The most interesting reported compound was isorhamnetin. Because, it provided cardioprotective effect against cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, and potentiated the anticancer efficacy of this drug [52,61]. Recently, there is the research on phenolic composition from methanolic extracts of the aerial parts of the two medicinal plants in Poland: Centaurea borysthenica Gruner and C. daghestanica (Lipsky) Wagenitz [At present, the corrected scientific name of this plant is Centaurea transcaucasica Sosn. ex Grossh. (http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/gcc-95497?ref=tpl1)] were analyzed together with their protective effects on cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin [53]. The obtained results from oxidative stress, cell viability, and mitochondrial membrane potential tests displayed their cardioprotective activity of both C. borysthenica and C. daghestanica extracts on rat cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin anticancer drug. According to this study, they found an attractive point that C. daghestanica methanolic extracts did not affect on efficacy of doxorubicin in this experiment [53].

(p3.1) In addition, the research group of Alhaider evaluated the cardioprotective potential of Phoenix dactylifera L. or date palm in English name or Nakl in Arabic name. The total flavonoid, total phenolic, in vitro antioxidant capacity and in vivo rodent myocardial infarction models with fruit extracts from 4 different varieties of date palm in eastern provision of Saudi Arabia were confirmed. The high concentrations of phenolics and flavonoids were detected in the fruit extracts that contributed the potential antioxidant activities and high cardioprotective effect against various induced factors in vivo myocardial infarction models by mobilizing the circulating progenitor cells from both bone marrow to the site of myocardial infraction, in order to promote tissue repairing from ischemic injury [56]. Syama and his colleagues evaluated the major phenolic acids and flavonoids from the different fractions of seeds extract from Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels, and their cardioprotective potential in in vitro H9c2 cardiac cell lines such as tertiary butyl hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress, LDL oxidation, HMG-CoA reductase and angiotensin converting enzyme modulation. The major phytochemical compounds from the analyzed fractions were gellagic acid, syringic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, cinnamic acid and quercetin. These fractions attenuated oxidative stress in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and molecular docking demonstrated the positive correlation between the major phytochemical compounds and key enzymes for preventing cardiovascular diseases i.e., angiotensin converting enzyme [57]. Moreover, the research group of Garjani investigated the potential of aerial parts extract from Marrubium vulgare L., a medicinal plant from Iran focusing on its cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo Wistar rat model. They determined total phenolic and flavonoids content of aqueous fraction of the extract, and their effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury of the rat hearts using Langendroff method; the obtained result proved that aqueous fraction from M. vulgare consisting of cardioprotective potential against this cardiac injury [48]. Aspalathin and phenylpyruvic acid-2-O-Î²-D-glucoside, the two of the major compounds from Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) R. Dahlgren were demonstrated as potential protective compounds to protect myocardial infarction caused by chronic hyperglycemia [49]. Likewise, puerarin is a potential isoflavones that was reported as an interesting candidate for cardioprotection by protecting myocardium from ischemia and reperfusion damage by means of opening the Ca 2+ -activated K + channel and activating the protein kinase C [51]; this research team conducted their study using in vivo Sprague-Dawley rats model. Tian and his group compared the cardioprotective effects between polyphenolic extracts from apple peel and apple flesh in in vivo mice model with cardiovascular risk factors; they found that the extracts of apple peels exhibited better cardioprotective ability than that of apple flesh in mice model [54]. This may probably due to the higher amount of both total phenolics and total flavonoids consisting in polyphenolic extracts from apple peel.
## (s5) Skin Protective Effect from UV Radiation
(p5.0) Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation can harm to skin. It induces extensive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eventually causes skin damages [76]. However, there are several strategies applicable for skin protection. Phytochemical compound, especially phenolics and flavonoids is one of the most interesting choices that exhibits beneficial effects on UV-irradiated skin [77][78][79]. Flavonoids have photoprotective effects that are antioxidant properties by their capacity to chelate iron which can damage lipid and protein on cell membrane, and modulate several signaling pathways, for example, inhibit xanthine oxidase which is considered as a source of ROS that contributes to oxidative stress [80,81]. Several phenolic compounds are reported as potential antioxidant molecules for treatment of various skin disorders including diseases which caused by UV radiation [4,78].
## (s6) Naturally Occurring Plant Phenolics and Flavonoids for Menopausal and Post-Menopausal Women
(p6.0) There is pros and cons between using synthetic chemical compounds and phytochemical substances in pharmacy and medicine. Synthetic substances or medicines are easy and quickly to produce in large scale of drug development process and modify as many forms of consumption for patients. Conversely, many non-natural (or synthetic chemical compounds) cause several undesirable side effects, particularly long-term treatments [95]. Some synthetic medicines were not accept for clinical treatments because of their harmful side effects. An obvious example is synthetic estrogen which was commonly used in menopause women for hormone replacement therapy a few decades ago. This synthetic chemical compounds could work well to reduce menopause symptoms, long before there were a number of researches discovered its unwanted side effects i.e., an increase in the risk of breast, uterus and ovarian cancers [95][96][97].

(p6.1) Estrogen is a sex hormone mainly responsible for reproductive functions and the menstrual cycle of women. In postmenopausal women, estrogen is depleted due to the failure of the response of ovary to pituitary. When the level of estrogen decreases, it leads to many postmenopausal symptoms including cardiovascular disease. In particular, postmenopausal woman who also has metabolic syndrome (MetS) will increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease [98]. The research study of Squadrito and his group showed that flavonoid supplementation can also improve cardiovascular function in postmenopausal woman with metabolic syndrome [99]. Genistein is an obvious example of interesting choice of flavonoid phytoestrogen for improving endothelial functions in postmenopausal women with MetS [100]. Gregorio and his research team investigated the effects of genistein supplement on cardiac function of postmenopausal women with MetS; postmenopausal women patients with type-2 Diabetes mellitus and free from previous cardiovascular disease 120 subjects were employed in this study [98]. The patients were equally divided into 2 groups: Genistein supplementation group and control group who have got placebo by using a computer-generated double-blind randomization. The result indicated that genistein can improve the cardiac function in postmenopausal women with MetS [98].
## (s8) Future Perspectives and Interesting Directions for Future Researches
(p8.0) (1) The low cost of medicines and many other medical products is very important to allow all people to access to the drug. Consequently, the flavonoid and phenolic compounds which are abundant found in a large number of plant may possible be an interesting choice of molecules for drug and medical product development.

(p8.1) (2) In the same species of medicinal plants, the different cultivars may provide different amount of flavonoid and phenolic compounds as well as the biological activities. Thus, the cultivars of medicinal plant should be taken into account for the future medical and pharmaceutical research studies.

(p8.2) (3) The geographic areas of raw plant material should also be analyzed and compared in the future research. Since the environmental factors e.g., nutrients and mineral in soil are also effect on the quality and quantity of phytochemical compounds in some species of medicinal plant as discussed in this work.

(p8.3) (4) Not only local medicinal plant species but also the wild or endemic species are interesting for the future studies, in order to discover the novel phytochemical compounds to increase the alternative sources of raw material for medical and pharmaceutical applications.

(p8.4) (5) The molecular mechanism and signaling pathway of many known flavonoid and phenolic compounds are need to be done in the future, so as to apply this knowledge to the drug development processes.

(p8.5) (6) The need of purified compounds to confirm data obtained with the plant extracts. (7) Epidemiological and in vitro studies are sometimes contradictory. In part because of the calculation of the intake based on general table estimated content without taking into account genetic variation among cultivars, geographic variations and so on. Also because of the possible need of metabolization by gut microflora for activation. Those of gut microflora are not taken into account, and quantification of the active circulating forms was not evaluated most of the time.
