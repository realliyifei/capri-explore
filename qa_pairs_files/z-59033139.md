## (s4) Classification and analysis
(p4.0) Following the screening and selection process, articles were then categorised according to either root causes of poor immunisation data or interventions that improved data quality.Within these two categories, classification of articles was based on previously researched conceptual frameworks.Lippeveld et al. [12] theorise that a health information system (HIS) is comprised of the information process and management structures [12].Building on this framework, Aqil et al. [13] Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) incorporates technical, organizational and behavioural factors as key determinants in the processes, outputs and outcomes of health information systems [13].A combined approach was employed using these existing theories to then guide the classification of articles.For identifying root causes, the following groupings were used: "governance", "programme management" and "HR capacity and practices".Governance consists of both policies and the HIS structure, reflective of the PRISM's organisational factor.Additionally, HR capacity and practices involve the attitudes and skills of staff similar to the PRISM's behavioural factors.Finally, programme management is determined by a combination of behavioural and organisational factors since its performance is a function of HIS infrastructure and managers' competencies.Interventions were split into two groupings: "Health Information Systems/Information Communication Technology (ICT) Interventions" and "Programme Management Interventions".Interventions that modify HIS/ICT operations fell under all three of PRISM's factors because as technical factors are introduced, governance and workers' skills also must be altered.Articles were analysed and subsequently ranked according to the methodology, generalizability, representativeness and baseline review for interventions.Results show the strongest articles at the top (Tables 1  and 2).
## (s6) Discussion
(p6.0) Inaccurate and unreliable data can significantly impair the ability to make evidence-based decision making [39].Because the infrastructure, governance and practices of an HIS directly influence data quality, it is thought that improvements in data should be part of the effort to strengthen health systems as a whole with improved quality of data enhancing better decision-making.We aimed to identify root causes of poor data quality and interventions that can provide effective and sustainable solutions to these problems.

(p6.1) Establishing a causal link between a determinant and data quality is challenging particularly as there are many different components of data management within an HIS that can influence the final quality of immunization data.Due to this complexity, classification of some articles were not wholly representative of its reported root cause.For example, the instance where incomplete information in the healthcare database was due to the high workload of staff, this problem can be attributed to a variety of reasons [23].It may be that financial strain on the health system results in reduced staff numbers and high workload, that the data processing by design causes too much workload or that programme managers have not effectively allocated responsibilities to allow for efficient data collection.

(p6.2) Comparing figures in different stages of data processing, e.g., between HF reports and district reports, sheds light on where discrepancies may arise.However this does not explain from where the root causes of these discrepancies arise.In addition, this method of comparison can be resource intensive and the majority of articles reviewed applied this methodology in only a small number of districts and health facilities bringing into question the generalizability of the results.Another methodology, employed by three articles [20,21,24], used an adaptation of the World Health Organisation Data Quality Selfassessment tool [40].Whilst this method is useful for identifying areas for improvement, an inherent fault lies in the lack of data validity with survey information [41].Articles that indirectly measured data quality through key informant interviews and formal surveys [19,[25][26][27][28] were helpful for identifying the role of attitudes and skills of staff, however provided limited proof that these factors directly caused poor data quality.
