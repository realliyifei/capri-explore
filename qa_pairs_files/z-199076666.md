## (s6) Analysis and Presentation of Results
(p6.0) It should be noted that once this search is conducted, the problem for the systematic study in this case lies in the intersection of both paradigms through a process that produces the discovery of the Candidate Services in the early stages of development with agile methodologies.

(p6.1) As a result of previous searches and after carrying out a manual screening of these works, it has been found out that there is a direct relationship between both paradigms only in two of them, linking requirements and services coherently and systematically.[9] [10] use agile techniques, but not for identifying Services in the construction of applications in the requirements phase, but for the deduction of Services in the design of service-oriented architectures from the requirements.

(p6.2) Hence, it can now be determined that no work has been identified in the current literature related to the discovery or search of services within a context using agile methodologies so as to support a given set of requirements.
## (s7) State of the Art of Agile Requirement Formalization
(p7.0) Research on agile requirements is very advanced in the IWT2 research group.In consequence, the SLR in this partial aspect will focus on the SLR carried out by this group [11].It presents a detailed state of the art study of Agile Requirements Engineering based on the involvement and interaction of stakeholders and users in the process of taking requirements within the field of user-guided design, with valuable contributions to the participation of users, techniques and artifacts used, documentation and non-formal requirements.It includes in turn, the revision of the SLRs of the following works:

(p7.1) • [12] whose main objective was to review the existing literature that copes with the challenges and agile practices in Requirements Engineering, including a good discussion about the related work.They aimed to understand how the traditional problems in Agile Requirements Engineering are solved.In conclusion, they provided 17 commonly used practices as well as practical challenges that agile teams had to face.Among the most used and accepted practices user stories, prioritization of the requirement, management of changes, modeling of requirements, management of requirements, review meetings and acceptance tests, matching for the analysis of requirements, retrospectives and continuous planning were included.

(p7.2) • [13] that combined a review of the literature with an exploratory study.The difficulties were analyzed when working with requirements in an agile environment, especially the causes that can lead to the lack of documentation (e.g.insufficient or incomplete requirements).This work contributed to an important research topic: the fact that documentation in ASD is often inadequately addressed.The authors defined ten difficulties that arise when identifying and managing agile requirements.These studies uncovered a series of repeated key factors that should be kept in mind in order to formalize agile requirements in a meta model:

(p7.3) • User History is one of the main techniques endorsed by all the studies and that is becoming a de facto standard within agile methodologies.It will therefore be necessary that the formalized requirement be based on User History, because it is currently the most commonly utilized technique in the field of Requirement Engineering [11].

(p7.4) • The set of requirements has to be as complete as possible, that is, it must cover the maximum number of possible requirements.Previous studies let us realize that the agile artifact called "Product Backlog" (product stack) is the one frequently used to represent User Stories and manage them.
