(p4.0) Finally, we conclude the article by highlighting some open challenges and future research directions in this field while putting a special emphasis on machine learning techniques for the detection and prevention of fraud in online ad systems.

(p4.1) Most of the previous research literature in this field (including [4,5]) have looked at the problem of advertising fraud in very generic ways, without explicitly identifying or naming the most likely fraud perpetrators and targets.The main novelty of this work is the fact that we focus on the categorization of ad fraud based on the main human actors (executors vs. victims).Furthermore, we provide illustrative real-world examples of different types of advertising fraud, thereby providing an important practical perspective that is very much missing in the current literature.Additionally, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing surveys that have identified the most important open challenges and future research directions in this field with a strong emphasis on the application of machine learning.

(p4.2) The remainder of this article is structured as follows.In Sections 2-6, we provide a general overview of the digital advertising ecosystem, while in Sections 7 and 8 we specifically focus on the topic of digital advertising fraud.In particular, in Section 2 we introduce the main elements of an online advertising ecosystem, the critical interactions among these elements, and various technologies involved in the delivery of the right ads to the right people at the right time.In Section 3, we specifically discuss different forms of digital advertising, and in Section 4 we describe two primary types of publisher-advertiser contract.In Section 5, we explain three most common types of revenue models used in digital advertising systems.In Section 6, we cover the concept of user tracking and profiling techniques as pertinent to digital advertising.Finally, in Section 7 we explore different types of fraud in the ad ecosystem, while in Section 8 we present a taxonomy of ad fraud prevention and detection methods.In Section 9, we outline the main conclusions of this study.
## (s7) Contextual Advertising
(p7.0) A user's visit to a web page typically indicates their implicit interest in the specific topic/content of this page [8].Consequently, an ad that directly correlates to the content of a web page has much higher chances of being viewed by the visitors of the given page.The type of advertising that capitalizes on this principle-by linking the context of an ad with the content of the page displaying this ad-is known as Contextual Advertising.An example of contextual advertising would be an ad offering a special price on a flight to Australia placed on an Australian airline company's website.Placement of 'contextual ads', which could be text-only or rich-media, can lead to improved user experience as well as increased revenue to the publisher, advertiser, and their respective ad network or exchange [10].
## (s17) Programmatic Direct
(p17.0) Programmatic direct advertising scheme [16] allows advertisers to directly pre-purchase guaranteed ad impressions from premium publishers that attract their most desired audiences.Like the PMP model, it matches select publishers with select advertisers; however, advertisers and publishers agree up-front on specific inventory and based on entirely predetermined 'cost per thousand impressions' (CPM) prices.Additionally, similar to RTB, the programmatic direct scheme can be fully automated, requiring no human intervention to be run.However, unlike RTB, it involves no auction or bidding process as the CPM is predetermined.
## (s18) Revenue Models in Digital Advertising Ecosystem
(p18.0) Advertisers are essentially companies with products to sell, and they invest money into buying online impressions hoping that these impressions will boost their profit.On the other side, publishers commit to displaying the advertisers' ads and, in return, will charge the advertisers a commission fee for the action(s) generated by the user.The amount of commission received by a publisher is called revenue [4].

(p31.0) Malvertising: Malvertising is a form of placement fraud that is carried out by utilizing advertising malware that gets injected into a publisher's website, and that ends up displaying unwanted ads or pop-ups on the computers of users visiting this site.Sood et al. [48] have pointed out that the common defects in the design of some website widgets pose a high risk of malvertising.Moreover, they have shown that Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)-as third-party ad servers which provide content to different domains on the Internet-are the primary means of spreading malvertising malware.By exploiting the servers of a particular CDN, attackers can inject malicious code in the form of malvertisement and achieve a broad distribution.
## (s32) 2.
(p32.0) Stuffing and Stacking: Ad fraud techniques that make use of components which are placed inside a web page but cannot be viewed by the naked eye are called 'stuffing' and 'stacking.Stuffing fraud include two primary forms: keywords stuffing and placement stuffing.Keyword stuffing occurs when specific keywords are hidden in the HTML tags of a fraudster's web page with the intention to increase the value/ranking of this page and its respective ads.On the other hand, placement stuffing is the act of hiding non-textual (i.e., multi-media) components inside a web page, such as: an ad in a small 1 × 1 pixel iframe (refer to Figure 4).Placement stacking is a fraud technique where two or more ads are placed/stacked on top of one other, with only the top ad being actually visible to the user [49].A single impression or click on such stacked ads would enable the fraudster to bill multiple advertisers.
## (s51) Detection of Digital Advertising Fraud in Academia 8.2.1. Placement Fraud Detection
(p51.0) As discussed earlier, placement fraud refers to fraudulent activities intended to manipulate or modify the content of a publisher's web pages in order to increase the number of impressions or clicks, as well as a variety of other actions that range from malvertising, ad injections to domain-name spoofing.

(p51.1) To combat placement fraud, Li et al. [82] have introduced a topology-based detection system called MadTrace, capable of automatically generating detection rules to inspect advertisement delivery processes and discover malvertising activities.MadTracer has two major components.The first component is responsible for identifying malvertising content-delivery paths by analysing a larger set of ad click-paths and their features.The second part is an analyser that monitors the infected publisher pages to study cloaking techniques and expand the detection results.The authors claim that their evaluation has shown that MadTracer works effectively against real-world malvertising activities.In particular, MadTracer has caught 15 times as many malicious domain-paths as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront combined, as well as several large-scale malvertising campaigns, including a new type of click-fraud attack.

(p51.2) Thomas et al. [66] have presented a detailed investigation into the scope and negative impact of ad injections and their supporting ecosystem.They have designed a multi-staged pipeline to detect ad injections and the value chain behind them.The proposed model is a client-side DOM scanner utilized on a subset of Google's websites.This DOM scanner has the ability to detect and report rogue ad elements.Through the scanner's client-side telemetry technique, the authors have discovered that over 5% of unique daily IP addresses accessing the Google websites during the time frame of the research have been impacted by ad injections via several vectors.Moreover, the authors have identified 50,870 Chrome extensions and 34,407 Windows binaries that have acted as unwanted ad injectors of which 38% and 17%, respectively, have been outright malicious.

(p51.3) To detect fake websites, Abbasi et al. [65] have introduced two categories of fake website detection tools: lookup systems and classifier systems.The lookup systems utilize a client-server architecture where the server-side keeps a blacklist of all known fake URLs, while the client-side tool examines the blacklist and alerts if a website poses a threat.In contrast, a classifier system is a client-side tool that applies a rule-based heuristic to a website's content or its DNS registration information.Classifier detection tools are independent of blacklists in detecting fake websites.They can provide better coverage than lookup systems for spoofed websites.Furthermore, in this work, the authors have proposed a support vector machine (SVM) classification model that utilizes a rich feature set to classify concocted and spoofed sites.Although the developed model appears to have outperformed the other comparable models, the findings of this work suggest that neither the proposed classifier nor the lookup system alone are an effective technique in combating various tactics employed by fraudsters.Instead, a hybrid system with regular/periodic updates of the classification model would be the most effective long-term solution.

(p71.0) Credential-based prevention mechanism (also known as Website Popularity or Page Ranking) refers to the task of assessing the creditability of a publisher or an advertiser in order to discover the authenticity of their web page contents or the number of impressions they generate.The reverse crawling (reverse engineering is the process of understanding the functioning and structure of a website and its information [100].For example, to evaluate a publisher's credentials, DSPs and advertisers can use reverse engineering/crawling to find the content of web pages and verify that the content matches the tags associated with the impression when bidding) method and trusted website ranking are the most common approach in that endeavor.

(p71.1) Stone-Gross et al. [99] have expanded the above classification by introducing a Performance-based Pricing approach.Namely, they believe that the Return on Investment (ROI) revenue model is a better alternative to the impression-based methods commonly used in the ad ecosystem.In the case of ROI model, advertisers are not concerned with the number of impressions but rather focus on how much return on investment they can get from a publisher.This type of revenue model can disincentivize impression fraud and eliminate ineffective advertising.
## (s72) Conclusions and Future Trends
(p72.0) Online advertising fraud aims to exfiltrate money from the ad ecosystem by conducting various types of fraudulent actions.This survey has provided a comprehensive study of online digital advertising platforms, their key components and the most popular revenue models.Additionally, various techniques to collect data on users' online activities and their behavioral patterns have also been reviewed.More importantly, the present work adds to the existing literature in this field by focusing on the categorization of ad fraud based on the main human actors-executors vs. victims-and providing illustrative real-world examples of different types of advertising fraud; this essential practical perspective makes it different from previous studies such as [4,5].Most existing works have discussed advertising fraud in very generic ways.They focused on issues relating to privacy threats and protection mechanisms [5,101], marketing perspective [102][103][104] and analytical assessment on challenges in online advertising [105,106].
