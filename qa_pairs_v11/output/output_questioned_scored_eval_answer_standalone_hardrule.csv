1. Below is a summary of the key findings that emerged from the work we covered in this survey.
2. Neurons learned within Deep NLP models capture non-trivial linguistic knowledge ranging from lexical phenomenon such as morphemes, words and multi-word expressions to highly complex global phenomenon such as semantic roles and syntactic dependencies.
3. Neuron analysis resonates with the findings of representation analysis (Belinkov et al., 2017a,b;Tenney et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2019) in demonstrating that the networks follow linguistic hierarchy.
4. Linguistic neurons are distributed across the network based on their complexity, with lower layers focused on the lexical concepts and middle and higher layers learning global phenomenon based on long-range contextual dependencies.
5. While the networks preserve linguistic hierarchy, many authors showed that information is not discretely preserved, but is rather distributed and redundantly present in the network.
6. It was also shown that a small optimal subset of neurons w.r.t any concept can be extracted from a network.
7. On another dimension, a few works showed that some concepts are localized to fewer neurons while others are distributed to a large group.

1. In general, MML Transformers fuse information across multiple modalities primarily at three levels: input (i.e., early fusion), intermediate representation (i.e., middle fusion), and prediction (i.e., late fusion).
2. Common early fusion based MML Transformer models [7], [104], [108] are also known as one-stream architecture, allowing the adoption of the merits of BERT due to minimal architectural modification.
3. The main difference between these one-stream models is the usage of problem-specific modalities with variant masking techniques.
4. With attention operation, a noticeable fusion scheme is introduced based on a notion of bottleneck tokens [175].
5. It applies for both early and middle fusion by simply choosing to-be-fused layers.
6. We note that the simple prediction-based late fusion [247], [248] is less adopted in MML Transformers.
7. This makes sense considering the motivations of learning stronger multimodal contextual representations and great advance of computing power.

1. The final layers of BERT are the most taskspecific.
2. In pre-training, this means specificity to the MLM task, which would explain why the middle layers are more transferable .
3. In fine-tuning, it explains why the final layers change the most (Kovaleva et al., 2019).
4. At the same time, Hao et al. (2019) report that if the weights of lower layers of the fine-tuned BERT are restored to their original values, it does not dramatically hurt the model performance.
5. Tenney et al. (2019a) suggest that while most of syntactic information can be localized in a few layers, semantics is spread across the entire model, which would explain why certain non-trivial examples get solved incorrectly at first but correctly at higher layers.
6. This is rather to be expected: semantics permeates all language, and linguists debate whether meaningless structures can exist at all (Goldberg, 2006, p.166-182).
7. But this raises the question of what stacking more Transformer layers actually achieves in BERT in terms of the spread of semantic knowledge, and whether that is beneficial.

1. Spurious Biases. The shortcut learning problem has been observed in various natural language understanding tasks under the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm, where models heavily rely on spurious correlations between input and labels in the fine-tuning data for prediction [31,35,98].
2. For example, in reading comprehension tasks, fine-tuned models tend to focus on the lexical matching of words between the question and the original passage, neglecting the intended reading comprehension task itself [53].
3. In contrast, large language models are not directly trained on fine-tuned datasets, which makes it less likely for them to learn shortcut features present in the fine-tuned dataset, thereby enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.
4. However, LLMs are not infallible and may exhibit some shortcut learning during in-context learning.
5. For example, recent preliminary studies have begun investigating the robustness of prompt-based methods in large-scale language models [111,129].
6. One such study evaluates the few-shot learning performance of GPT-3 on text classification and information extraction tasks [129].
7. and reveal that the examined LLMs are susceptible to majority label bias and position bias, where they tend to predict answers based on the frequency or position of the answers in the training data.
8. Moreover, these LLMs exhibit common token bias, favoring answers that are prevalent in their pre-training corpus.
9. Recent studies show that this positional bias can be mitigated by selecting proper prompts [68].
10. In summary, while LLMs significantly reduce the shortcut learning problem prevalent in fine-tuned models, they still exhibit some shortcut learning issues and should be approached with caution when deploying them in downstream applications.",0.09999999999999998,1.0,0.9

1. Regarding syntactic competence of BERT's MLM, Goldberg (2019) showed that BERT takes subject-predicate agreement into account when performing the cloze task.
2. This was the case even for sentences with distractor clauses between the subject and the verb, and meaningless sentences.
3. A study of negative polarity items (NPIs) by Warstadt et al. (2019) showed that BERT is better able to detect the presence of NPIs (e.g. ""ever"") and the words that allow their use (e.g. ""whether"") than scope violations.
4. The above evidence of syntactic knowledge is belied by the fact that BERT does not ""understand"" negation and is insensitive to malformed input.
5. In particular, its predictions were not altered even with shuffled word order, truncated sentences, removed subjects and objects (Ettinger, 2019).

1. A key issue that affects the performance of MTL is how to properly choose a set of tasks for joint training.
2. Generally, tasks that are similar and complementary to each other are suitable for multi-task learning, and there are some works that studies this issue for NLP tasks.
3. For semantic sequence labeling tasks, [77] reports that MTL works best when the label distribution of auxiliary tasks has low kurtosis and high entropy.
4. This finding also holds for rumor verification [53].
5. Similarly, [71] reports that tasks with major differences, such as implicit and explicit discourse classification, may not benefit much from each other.
6. To quantitatively estimate the likelihood of two tasks benefiting from joint training, [104] proposes a dataset similarity metric which considers both tokens and their labels.

1. Although LLMs have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, their performance in regression tasks has been less impressive.
2. For example, ChatGPT's performance on the GLUE STS-B dataset, which is a regression task evaluating sentence similarity, is inferior to a fine-tuned RoBERTa performance [130].
3. The Regression tasks typically involve predicting a continuous value rather than a discrete label, posing unique challenges for LLMs.
4. One primary reason for their subpar performance is the inherent difference between the language modeling objective and the regression task objective.
5. LLMs are designed to predict the next word in a sequence or generate coherent text, with their pre-training focused on capturing linguistic patterns and relationships.
6. Consequently, their internal representations may not be well-suited for modeling continuous numerical outputs.
7. Besides, LLMs have predominantly been trained on text data, focusing on capturing the intricacies of natural language processing.
8. As a result, their performance on multimodal data, which involves handling multiple data types such as text, images, audio, video, actions, and robotics, remains largely unexplored.

3. The commonly used pretraining data consists of a myriad of text sources, including books, articles, and websites.
4. The data is carefully curated to ensure a comprehensive representation of human knowledge, linguistic nuances, and cultural perspectives.

6. The extra in-domain vocabulary is generated using Word2vec and then aligned [122] or generated directly using WordPiece [123] over biomedical text.
7. The main drawback in these low-cost domain adaptation approaches is an increase in the size of the model with the addition of in-domain vocabulary.

1. Gaining a deeper understanding of emergent abilities, inverse scaling phenomenon and U-shape phenomenon in LLMs is essential for advancing research in this field.
2. In a certain sense, the U-shape phenomenon suggests that small-scale models and huge-scale models make predictions with different internal mechanisms.
3. From this perspective, the U-shape phenomenon can be seen as a transformation of the inverse-scaling phenomenon due to some emergent abilities from sufficiently large models [114].
4. GPT-4 [76] exhibits a reversal of the inverse scaling phenomenon in some cases, such as on a task called Hindsight Neglect.
5. The explanation for these behaviors of LLMs during scaling is still an open problem.
6. Several hypotheses have been proposed.
7. For emergent abilities, one explanation is that there may be multiple key steps for a task and the LLM cannot handle this task until it's large enough to handle every step, and another explanation is focused on the granularity of evaluation metrics [113].

2. Wiedemann et al. (2019) find that BERT's contextualized embeddings form distinct and clear clusters corresponding to word senses, which confirms that the basic distributional hypothesis holds for these representations.
3. However, Mickus et al. (2019) note that representations of the same word varies depending on position of the sentence in which it occurs, likely due to NSP objective.
4. Ethayarajh (2019) measure how similar the embeddings for identical words are in every layer and find that later BERT layers produce more contextspecific representations.

3. [73] learns a multi-lingual NMT model with constituency parsing and image caption generation as two auxiliary tasks.
4. Similarly, [144] learns an NMT model together with the help of NER, syntactic parsing, and semantic parsing tasks.
5. To make an NMT model aware of the vocabulary distribution of the retrieval corpus for query translation, [103] adds an unsupervised auxiliary task that learns continuous bag-of-words embeddings on the retrieval corpus in addition to the sentence-level parallel data.

1. However, different parts of the shared features are not equally important to each task.
2. To selectively choose features from the shared features and alleviate inter-task interference, several models have been devised to control information flow between tasks.
3. For example, [69] adapts LSTMs to the MTL setting by adding a global memory module and pairwise local shared memory modules, and fuses shared features into hidden states of each LSTM by a read gate and a write gate.
4. Similarly, GIRN [39] interleaves hidden states of LSTMs and [148] extends this idea to use pairwise coupling and local fusion layers with a global fusion layer to share information between tasks.
5. The sifted multi-task learning method [133] filters useless features by per-task gating and selects useful information from the shared memory by a multi-head attention mechanism.

4. DSPT or SPT allows the model to have an in-domain vocabulary that is learned over in-domain text.
5. However, both these approaches involve learning the model parameters from scratch which is highly expensive.

1. Natural Language Inference (NLI) is an important NLP task that requires sentence-level semantics.
2. It involves identifying the relationship between a pair of sentences i.e., whether the second sentence entails or contradicts or neural with the first sentence.
3. Training the model on NLI datasets helps the models to learn sentence-level semantics, which is useful in many tasks like paraphrase mining, information retrieval [136] in the general domain and medical concept normalization [137], [138], semantic relatedness [139], question answering [66] in the biomedical domain.
4. NLI is framed as a three-way sentence pair classification problem.
5. Here models like BERT learn the representation of given two sentences jointly and the three-way task-specific softmax classifier predicts the relationship between the given sentence pair.
6. MedNLI [61] is the in-domain NLI dataset with around 14k instances generated from MIMIC-III [88] clinical notes.
7. As MedNLI contains sentence pairs taken from EHRs, Kanakarajan et al. [140] further pretrained BioBERT [16] on MIMIC-III and then fine-tuned the model on MedNLI to achieve an accuracy of 83.45%.
8. Cengiz et al. [136]0 applied an ensemble of two BioBERT models and achieved an accuracy of 84.7%.

1. The tree-like architecture uses a single trunk to force all tasks to share the same low-level feature representation, which may limit the expressive power of the model for each task.

1. The simplest form of modular architectures is a single shared module coupled with task-specific modules as in tree-like architectures described in Section 2.1.1.
2. Besides, another common practice is to share the first embedding layers across tasks as [58,156] did.
3. [1] shares word and character embedding matrices and combines them differently for different tasks.
4. [103] shares two encoding layers and a vocabulary lookup table between the primary neural machine translation task and the Relevance-based Auxiliary Task (RAT).

6. Unicoder [49] shares vocabulary and the entire transformer architecture among different languages and tasks.
7. Shared embeddings can be used alongside task-specific embeddings [59,138] as well.
8. In addition to word embeddings, [147] shares label embeddings between tasks.
9. Researchers have also developed modular architectures at a finer granularity.

2. Similar to auxiliary MTL, tasks in joint MTL are usually related to or complementary to each other.
3. Table 2 gives an overview of task combinations used in joint MTL models.
4. In certain scenarios, we can even convert models following the traditional pipeline architecture as in single-task learning to joint MTL models so that different tasks can adapt to each other.
5. For example, [93] converts the parsing of Alexa meaning representation language into three independent tagging tasks for intents, types, and properties, respectively.
6. [110] transforms the pipeline relation between POS tagging and morphological tagging into a parallel relation and further builds a joint MTL model.
7. Joint MTL has been proven to be an effective way to improve the performance of standard NLP tasks.

1. In some cases, multiple tasks are learned sequentially.
2. Such tasks usually form a clear dependency relationship or are of different difficulty levels.
3. For instance, [50] uses a baby step curriculum learning approach [18] and trains different tasks in the order of increasing difficulties.

254408864,A Comprehensive Survey on Multi-hop Machine Reading Comprehension Approaches,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bad1ea60373fc77c1ff82c5ff99f1fd38c972ae8,"Question: Why are graph-based techniques prominent in multihop machine reading comprehension (MRC)?

1. Graph-based techniques because of their natural language relationship representation ability [39] has attracted attention in multihop MRC.
2. It is natural to model natural language context into graph structure and the process of multi-hop reasoning as moving among nodes [14].
3. The main idea of the Graph-based technique is to construct a graph based on the context and question, and then the reasoning is performed by message passing over this structure using graph neural networks.
4. The process of constructing the graph from large textual data and reasoning over it are challenging tasks.
5. There are a lot of studies that focus on these challenges which are explained in this subsection in detail.",-1.0,0.0,1.0
