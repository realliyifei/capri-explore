Below is a content in a list of itemized sentences. Please rate the deep of the content.
The content is considered deep if it is discussed in detail, with a lot of information and explanation. The content is considered shallow if it is discussed briefly, with little information and explanation.
bad - Superficiail; the discussion didn't deepen any opinion or fact in the content
good - Deep; the discussion deepened the opinion or fact in the content
Only return the rating, without anything else. You should only rate as good if you are confident that the content is deep. If you are unsure, rate as bad.

Content: 1. Pre-training data plays a pivotal role in the development of large language models.
2. As the foundation of remarkable capabilities [5,47] of LLMs, the quality, quantitative, and diversity of pre-training data influence the performance of LLMs significantly [124].
3. The commonly used pretraining data consists of a myriad of text sources, including books, articles, and websites.
4. The data is carefully curated to ensure a comprehensive representation of human knowledge, linguistic nuances, and cultural perspectives.
5. The importance of pretraining data lies in its capacity to inform the language model with a rich understanding of word knowledge, grammar, syntax, and semantics, as well as the ability to recognize context and generate coherent responses.
6. The diversity of pretraining data also plays a crucial role in shaping the model's performance, and the selection of LLMs highly depends on the components of the pretraining data.
7. For example, PaLM [22] and BLOOM [92] excel in multilingual tasks and machine translation with an abundance of multilingual pretraining data.
8. Moreover, PaLM's performance in Question Answering tasks is enhanced by incorporating a considerable amount of social media conversations and Books corpus [22].
9. Likewise, code execution and code completion capabilities of GPT-3.5 (code-davinci-002) are amplified by the integration of code data in its pretraining dataset.
10. In brief, when selecting LLMs for downstream tasks, it is advisable to choose the model pre-trained on a similar field of data.

Content: 1. Scaling of LLMs (e.g. parameters, training computation, etc.) can greatly empower pretrained language models.
2. With the model scaling up, a model generally becomes more capable in a range of tasks.
3. Reflected in some metrics, the performance shows a power-law relationship with the model scale.
4. For example, the cross-entropy loss which is used to measure the performance for language modeling decreases linearly with the exponential increase in the model scale, which is also called 'scaling-law' [41,47].
5. For some crucial abilities, such as reasoning, scaling the model has gradually transformed these abilities from a very low state to a usable state, and even approaching human capabilities.
6. In this section, we provide an overview of the usage of LLMs in terms of the abilities and behaviors of LLMs along with scaling.
