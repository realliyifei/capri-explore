The Covid-19 pandemic has presented a multitude of challenges in conducting research with human subjects. In response, researchers have found creative ways to complete these studies using alternative methods that incorporate social distancing. Fortunately, numerous technologies exist today that allow individuals to connect with one another over short and long distances. The current study describes the development of LifeBio Memory: an app-based product that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve an existing life story intervention designed for persons living with dementia (PWD). Seven focus groups (n=35), originally planned in-person, were successfully converted to a virtual setting. Groups were hosted using a Zoom platform, lasted 75-90 minutes (Mean = 85; SD = 5.3), and consisted of participants from 14 different states: One group of community-dwelling PWDs with early-stage dementia (n=5); two groups of current and former users of the original LifeBio program (n=12); and four groups of residential care staff and directors (n=18). Virtual focus group delivery was determined to be an acceptable and feasible alternative to traditional in-person formats. Topics discussed in this poster will include: 1) recruitment procedures, 2) screening protocols, 3) methods for sharing materials, 4) guidance for providing technology support, and 5) communication strategies to increase retention. Further discussion will focus on challenges faced when collecting data in a virtual setting, tips for successful facilitation, advantages to using virtual alternatives, and other lessons learned from the virtual field. Providing high quality, cost-effective dementia care remains a major health challenge. Life story work, used in residential care settings, helps engage persons living with dementia (PWD) at a low cost with minimal staff burden. LifeBio, one such intervention, is designed to elicit life history data and care preference information through comprehensive life story interviews. LifeBio Memory, an adaptation of LifeBio, utilizes novel speech-to-text technology to process life story data more efficiently. Seven focus groups were conducted to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of LifeBio Memory. Three types of focus groups were held (n=35) and audio recorded: 1) One group of early-stage PWDs (n=5); 2) Two groups of current and former users of original LifeBio (n = 12); and 3) Four groups of residential care staff and directors (n=18). Sessions were transcribed and thematic analyses were conducted. Findings indicated high levels of acceptability and feasibility of LifeBio Memory. Further, a secondary theme emerged signaling the need to prioritize the emotional safety of PWDs participating in life story work. This poster will discuss: 1) the life story interview process, 2) identifying PWDs who would most benefit from a life story program, 3) involving family and staff care partners to identify sensitive topics, 4) interview question design, selection and order, and 5) expanding life story work across diverse communities. Discussion will highlight the importance of protecting the emotional well-being of marginalized communities by identifying potential underlying traumas that could impact the safe delivery of otherwise effective life story interventions. Research shows that men in the U.S. experience significant morbidity and earlier mortality than women and are less likely to access, interpret, and apply health information to improve their outcomes. Although evidence-based health promotion programs have proven successful at increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors and reducing morbidity among older adults, older males are still significantly less likely to enroll and sustain participation in such health interventions. While studies have shown the barriers and facilitators to older adult participation in health programs in general, it is largely unknown why older male recruitment and participation in health promotion interventions remains so low. In this poster presentation, we conducted a thorough review of the last 20 years of existing research across a variety of academic search databases to outline the barriers, facilitators, and recommendations for increasing older male participation in health promotion programs. Of 1,194 initial search results, 383 article abstracts were thoroughly screened for inclusion, and 26 articles met all inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded and analyzed using Grounded Theory and reveal that masculine gender roles, as well as program scope, environment, and gender of the instructors and other participants, were important factors for male participation. Interventions should include men in all aspects of program planning and implementation, take into account men's existing relationships and interests to create gender-sensitive programming, and clearly delineate the benefits to participation. Lastly, the field of public health would benefit by helping to normalize men's participation in health promotion interventions. Literacy skills are essential adult competencies for economic, social, political and cultural participation, which are linked to higher quality of life. Literacy skills are known to be lower for older age groups. However, relatively little is 838
