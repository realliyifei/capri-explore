The aim of this study was to evaluate whether specific etiologies of neonatal seizures have distinct ictal electroclinical features. A systematic review of English articles using the PubMed database since 2004 (last update 9/26/16). Search terms included text words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to neonatal seizures.Eligible articles included reports of neonates with seizures with a full description of seizure semiology and electroclinical findings. Independent extraction of data was performed by 2 authors using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators. Data were collected for every individual patient described in the articles. The dataset was analyzed with the Fisher exact test. The initial search led to 8507 titles; using filters, 2910 titles and abstracts were identified, with 177 full texts selected to be read. Fifty-seven studies were included in the analysis with 151 neonates (37.7 male and 62.9% term). Genetic etiologies (51%) and sequential seizures (41.1%) predominated in this sample and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) accounted for| METHODOLOGYFor this systematic review, we used the PubMed database and search terms related to neonatal seizures (see below). The search period was from January 2004 to 2016 (last update 9/26/16), as before 2004, in the majority of studies, the seizure description was not confirmed by video-EEG and was based on the clinical classification proposed by Volpe.15The filters used were human studies and English language. only 4%. The low prevalence of HIE observed was probably due to a publication bias. A significant association was found between etiology and seizure type: hemorrhage with autonomic seizures (P = 0.003), central nervous system (CNS) infection and stroke with clonic seizures (P = 0.042, P < 0.001, respectively), metabolic/vitaminrelated disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism with myoclonic seizures (P < 0.001). There were also specific electroencephalography (EEG) patterns seen with certain etiologies: vascular disorders and electrolyte imbalance with focal ictal discharges (P < 0.001, P = 0.049 respectively), vitamin-related disorders with multifocal (P = 0.003), and all categories of genetic disorders with burst-suppression (P < 0.001). Clonic and autonomic seizures were more frequently present with focal EEG abnormalities (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001), whereas tonic and myoclonic seizures present with burst-suppression (P = 0.001, P = 0.005). In conclusion, our data suggest that specific associations of etiologies of neonatal seizures with distinct clinical features and EEG patterns might help in the decision to establish appropriate treatment.K E Y W O R D Selectroclinical features, neonatal EEG, neonatal seizures, semiology Key Points • Specific etiologies of neonatal seizures may be associated with distinct clinical features and these associations might be useful in countries with limited resources • Specific electroclinical patterns may help in the recognition of the etiology of neonatal seizures • Widespread use of the Neonatal Task Force proposal should be helpful for collecting data in future studies How to cite this article: Nunes ML, Yozawitz EG, Zuberi S, et al.

# | INTRODUCTION

Clinical identification of seizures in the neonate remains a challenge to neonatologists and other specialists caring for newborns. Neonates may demonstrate a vast repertoire of movements/behaviors seen in normal as well as sick newborns that may not be epileptic in origin. 1,2 Furthermore, the clinical features of seizures may be less clear compared to seizures in older children and adults. Although the latest World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Neonatal Seizures strongly recommended that all clinical seizures should be confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG), often the equipment is not available in some settings or not at all times in many settings, and the decision to start treatment is based solely on clinical aspects. 3 This can result either in misdiagnosis or overtreatment. 1,3,4 Identifying associations between neonatal seizure etiology, semiology, and EEG features might help in the distinction of acute symptomatic seizures from seizures related to epilepsy, which influences the proper approach to treatment.

Previous studies that analyzed this relationship were not necessarily based on simultaneous EEG confirmation of the seizures [5][6][7][8][9] or did not express, case by case, the electroclinical aspects of the ictal seizure. [10][11][12][13][14] We conducted a systematic review in neonates with welldocumented electroclinical seizures to answer the following questions: (a) how etiology relates to semiology; (b) how etiology relates to EEG; and (c) how semiology relates to EEG features. We aimed to integrate the findings of existing studies to see if there is a relationship between ictal electroclinical features and etiology on seizures occurring during the neonatal period.

NUNES Et al.


## | Inclusion criteria

• Studies describing term and preterm neonates with seizures, with a description of the seizure semiology, concomitant EEG findings, and etiologic investigations. • Seizures from full-term infants were included if they occurred within 30 days postdelivery. • Seizures from preterm infants were included if they occurred within the postmenstrual age (gestational age plus chronologic age in weeks) of 40 weeks.


## | Search strategy

The following search strategy was employed ((neonatal seizures) OR (neonatal convulsions) OR (("Infant, Newborn"[MeSH]) AND seizures) OR (("Infant, Newborn"[MeSH]) AND convulsions)).


## | Selection criteria

Studies were selected if the title and/or abstract suggested a description of semiology, EEG, or video-EEG findings.


## | Exclusion criteria

• Review articles, editorials, letters to the editor, articles without individual description of seizure semiology and/or EEG. • Articles that included EEG and semiology but were not within the neonatal period as described above.


## | Data collection and analysis

Titles and abstracts were first screened by 2 authors (MLN and RP) using predefined data fields. All full texts were read by the same authors, and the data were extracted and organized in an Excel table (Microsoft Corp.) and discussed within the group to assess quality indicators and reliability. The following variables were extracted: full bibliographic reference, number of patients, sex, gestational age, age at first seizure, etiology, and seizure semiology with EEG description. We used the list of etiologies as described in the 2017 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of seizures and epilepsies 16 but, because hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is so common in the neonatal period, we assigned it a special category. We have classified vascular etiologies and cortical malformations as a separate group, due to their frequency in this age group, instead of under the rubric of structural category as suggested in the ILAE classification. Thus, the etiologies were classified into the following 7 groups: (a) HIE, (b) cortical malformations, (c) central nervous system (CNS) infection, (d) metabolic (electrolyte imbalance, inborn errors of metabolism, vitamin-related disorders, and withdrawal seizures), (e) genetic (channelopathies, chromosomal disorders, other gene disorders), (f) vascular (stroke and hemorrhage), and (g) Unknown. Although inborn errors of metabolism and vitamin-related disorders can be included in either genetic or metabolic categories, we decided to include these cases in metabolic disorders. Similarly, although cortical malformations may have a genetic component, for the purpose of this report, we assigned them under the structural category. From the 57 articles included, we could evaluate electroclinical data from a total of 151 neonates (Table 1). Semiology was described as clonic, tonic, myoclonic, automatisms, epileptic spasms, and autonomic, when it was possible to identify the main clinical feature of the seizure. We used the term sequential seizures, according to the report of ILAE Neonatal Task Force (available online) 17 and the 2017 ILAE classification manual, in situations when it was difficult to identify the dominant feature, typically in longer seizures where a sequence of clinical features was seen, often with changing lateralization. 18 The articles were reviewed by 3 of the authors (RP, MN, and EY) for agreement in seizure type based on the seizure semiology described in the articles. The ictal EEG patterns were classified as focal (unilateral or bilateral onset), multifocal (more than 2 different and independent foci), or burst-suppression. However, in many articles, burst-suppression was described as a background pattern, and the authors did not specify if the seizure episode correlated with the diffuse suppression. In Table 1, we documented how the various authors used the term burstsuppression in their papers.

The guidelines from preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis and a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews methodology were used to analyze papers included in the study. [19][20][21] We initially planned to use meta-analytic techniques. 22 However, because there was a large number of studies with only single cases, confidence intervals could not be calculated, thereby preventing the meta-analysis calculations. Nevertheless, we collected and included data for every individual patient described in the studies. Furthermore, the dataset was analyzed as if it came from a single study, with the Fisher exact test. Significant results were considered when the P-value was <0.05. When the Pvalue was equal to 0.000, we have expressed it as P < 0.001.

The data were analyzed looking at combinations of clinical semiology of the seizures, etiology, and EEG patterns. In the statistical analysis, if the initial evaluation of the data suggested an association between or among the groups of etiology, all the other categories were grouped together. For example, if an association between a channelopathy (genetic group) and tonic seizures was observed, the statistical analysis (Fisher exact test) was done by grouping all other etiologies (ie, channelopathy vs all others) and all other seizure types (ie, tonic vs all others) and creating a 2 × 2 table. The same approach was applied to compare seizure type and EEG as well as etiology and EEG. Indicates when burst-suppression was not clearly defined as ictal or interictal pattern/background abnormality.

NUNES Et al. Figure 1 demonstrates the steps of the systematic review and inclusion of the articles. From the initial search, there were 8507 titles. After applying filters (period 2004-2016, human studies, English language), the number decreased to 2910. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, we excluded review articles, editorial letters, and expert opinions. This left 177 full-text articles. Of these, 117 articles were excluded for the following reasons: there was no individual semiology description of the seizures; seizures did not occur during the neonatal period, or there were only descriptions of interictal EEG or no neonatal EEG description at all; and finally, there was no clinical-EEG correlation. Three articles were not available online. We therefore identified 57 articles that provided data to correlate the EEG patterns with clinical semiology of seizures and the description of the etiologic diagnosis (Table 1).


# | RESULTS

Although these studies included data on 282 neonates, several cases were duplicates or information was not available to compare individual semiology vs etiology vs EEG. Thus, 151 neonates were included in the final analysis. In each study, the number of patients included varied from 1 to 16 (median 1, mean ± standard deviation [SD] 2.78 ± 3.20).

Of the neonates included, 37.7% were male and 45.0% female; 62.9% were born at term. Information regarding sex or gestational age was not available in 17.2% and 24.5% of the cases, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the semiology, etiology, and EEG findings.


## | Etiology and seizure type

A genetic etiology was most frequently described among the cases included in this study (51.0%). This was followed by vascular (21.9%) and metabolic/vitamin-related disorders (12.6%). In the genetic group, the most prevalent seizure type was sequential, described in 48.0% of the cases, followed by tonic seizures (33.7%; Table 3). It should be noted that a tonic component was reported in many sequential seizures, irrespective of the etiology. However, it was more frequently reported in genetic etiologies (64.2% of the cases; P = 0.019); it was reported in 12.5% of metabolic/vitamin-related disorders. in 10.7% of vascular cases, in 8.93% of seizures of unknown etiology, in 1.7% of HIE, and in 1.7% of cortical malformations. For the vascular etiology, the predominant seizure type was clonic (60.6%). For metabolic/vitamin-related disorders, we found sequential seizures in 42.1% of the cases, followed by myoclonic in 31.5%.

Analysis of the relationship between seizure semiology and etiology revealed that sequential seizures occurred with all etiologies as shown in Table 3. Some seizure types significantly correlated with specific etiologies: infection

and genetic disorders with clonic seizures (P = 0.042 and P < 0.001), metabolic/vitamin-related disorders with myoclonic seizures (P < 0.001), and vascular with sequential seizures (P = 0.009). When specific etiologies were analyzed among the groups, certain etiologies were significantly associated with specific seizure types: hemorrhage with autonomic seizures (P = 0.003), stroke with clonic seizures (P < 0.001), and inborn errors of metabolism with myoclonic seizures (P < 0.001).


## | Etiology and EEG features

Certain etiologies were clearly related to specific EEG patterns. Focal ictal discharges were more prevalent in vascular etiologies (87.8%, P < 0.001), and burst-suppression in genetic cases (51.9%, P < 0.001). Among the groups of etiologies, some specific disorders were also significantly correlated with ictal EEG patterns, such as electrolyte imbalance and focal discharges (100%, P = 0.049), vitamin deficiency and multifocal (63.3%, P = 0.035), and channelopathies and inborn errors of metabolism with burst-suppression (50.7%, P < 0.001; and 100%, P < 0.001, respectively). Specific etiologies where the burst-suppression pattern was described either as an ictal or interictal pattern are shown in Table 4.


## | Seizure type and EEG features

The predominant seizure type was sequential (41.1%), and the predominant EEG abnormality described was focal discharges (37.1%).

The frequency of each seizure type and related EEG features is presented in Table 5. Clonic seizures were mostly associated with focal ictal EEG abnormalities (61.1%, P = 0.001), and tonic and myoclonic seizures were associated with burst-suppression (57.7%, P = 0.005; and 77.8%, P = 0.005). Autonomic seizures were also associated with focal EEG discharges in 85.7% of the cases (P < 0.001). The single case of automatisms was associated with a focal EEG discharge, and the 2 cases of epileptic spasms had a burst-suppression pattern. Sequential seizures were equally associated with different EEG patterns (25.8% with focal, 45.2% with multifocal discharges, and 29.0% with burst-suppression).


## | Emerging associations based on the report of etiology-specific electroclinical features of neonatal seizures

We were able to establish some associations based on data acquired from this systematic review.

Some etiologies, generally related to acute events, were associated with specific clinical features and ictal EEG alterations, for example, 72% of the 25 patients with stroke had clonic seizures and 88% focal EEG; of the 4 patients with CNS infection, 3 had clonic seizures and multifocal EEG (75%).

Genetic and metabolic/vitamin-related etiologies could also be associated with specific electroclinical features. The 3 cases of inborn errors of metabolism had myoclonic seizures and a burst-suppression pattern described in all the patients. From the 11 patients with vitamin deficiency,  11,14,23,24 However, in many countries and in population-based studies, this technique is not readily available in all neonatal units. [6][7][8][9] We agree with previous reports that it is often difficult to accurately differentiate between seizure-related and nonseizure movements in infants using clinical evaluation alone. 11,14,23,24 However, the combination of etiology, semiology, and EEG findings that we present in this review could help in classifying seizures in neonates.

We have observed that certain etiologies have a significant correlation with semiology (eg, stroke and CNS infection with clonic seizures, hemorrhage with autonomic seizures, inborn errors of metabolism, and the whole group of metabolic/vitamin-related disorders with myoclonic seizures, channelopathies, and sequential or tonic seizures).

In contrast to previous studies of neonatal seizures where the predominant etiology was HIE, 5,6,8,9,25,26 we have observed an atypical distribution of etiologies, as the majority of cases with complete description of seizure semiology and EEG findings were related to a genetic etiology (either channelopathies or other gene disorders). This is likely due to a reporting bias, as a large number of case reports of genetic syndromes have appeared in the literature in the last few years. However, it is important to note that over the past several decades, the reported etiologies of neonatal seizures have significantly changed and that some etiologies (eg, hypocalcemia and other electrolytes imbalances) [27][28][29] have decreased due to improved neonatal care. At the same time, the improvement and availability of genetic testing has led to more investigation of genetic etiologies of seizures and epilepsies in the neonate. This increased interest has led authors to focus their publications on the detailed description of these syndromes. [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41] In a recent paper, Shellhaas and collaborators reported the findings from "The National Seizure Registry" of 611 newborns. They observed a predominance of acute-onset seizures (87.0%) in comparison to neonatal-onset epilepsy. In those newborns epilepsy (n = 79), 46.8% had a genetic etiology and only 3.7% had HIE as a comorbidity. 42 Because KCNQ2 mutations were the single most common cause of neonatal seizures identified in this review, we were able to confirm an electroclinical pattern highly suggestive of this diagnosis: sequential seizures (with a tonic component) or exclusively tonic seizures associated with a burst-suppression or a multifocal EEG.

The seizure semiology description in the articles reviewed herein did not necessarily follow any of the previously proposed classifications. 1,5 Some authors simply described the observed motor phenomena in their own words and this made data comparison difficult to achieve. The Task Force on Neonatal Seizures, established by the ILAE in 2014, aimed to integrate current concepts in neonatal seizures and epilepsies into the 2017 ILAE Classification of Seizures and Epilepsies, 17,18 with a modification of this scheme, adapted to neonatal particularities. Widespread use of this proposal might be helpful for collecting data in future studies.

Some limitations of this study were related to issues of reliance on the quality of reported studies, unclear or incomplete description of seizure semiology, and inconsistent methods of reading and reporting EEG patterns. Many authors have used the term burst-suppression to describe their EEG data without specifying if this pattern was consistent throughout the recording (and thus indicative of severe encephalopathy) or only during the motor seizure resembling an electrodecremental response. Future studies are needed to accurately describe the semiology of seizures that may be associated with an electrodecremental response or ictal burst-attenuation. In addition, some authors did not specify the background activity or clearly Undetermined/unknown (n = 9) 3 (33.3%) 5 (55.6%) 1 (11.1%)* 0 (0.0%) CNS, central nervous system. Burst-suppression was described as an ictal pattern *in 2 neonates (one with vitamin-related disorder and one with unknown etiology) and as an interictal pattern **in eight (3 with inborn errors of metabolism, 3 with other gene disorders, and 2 with vitamin-related disorders); in the remaining cases, it was not clearly defined as an ictal or interictal pattern/background abnormality.

differentiate ictal from interictal findings. We would recommend that a standardized reporting system for EEG studies, including description of the background activity, focality, as well as ictal and interictal patterns, be described to improve such systematic reviews. Due to the small percentage of preterm neonates in the sample, our findings might be more consistent for term neonates. Another limitation was that we were unable to develop a proportional meta-analysis, since many of the studies reported fewer than 3 patients. Because of this, we had to group all neonates, as they belonged to one single study. 19 On the other hand, this limitation gave us the opportunity to analyze all the data together as a large cohort. Finally, due to reporting bias in the literature, we were not able to find papers describing electroclinical patterns for the most prevalent etiology of neonatal seizures, HIE, or any specific patterns characteristic for preterm neonates.

Recommendations for future studies may include the publication of complete clinical data of the neonates (including sex and gestational age) using a systematic approach to describe EEG findings and a consistent classification of neonatal seizures, using, for example, the proposed classification of neonatal seizures referenced by the ILAE Task Force 17 when approved by the ILAE.

In conclusion, specific combinations of etiology, semiology, and EEG findings of neonatal seizures may be beneficial for an empirical approach to neonatal seizures. In this systematic review, we have shown that some etiologies have a specific correlation with semiology and ictal EEG patterns. These patterns may be helpful in making treatment decisions in countries with limited resources.

b Information related to ictal EEG except in some cases of burst-suppression (BS). 

Burst-suppression was described as an ictal pattern in 2 neonates and as an inter-
ictal in 8; in the remining cases, it was not clearly defined as an ictal or interictal 
pattern/background abnormality. 
7 (63.6%) had sequential seizures and multifocal EEG find-
ings. Among the 67 patients diagnosed with channelopa-
thies, 88.0% presented either tonic or sequential seizures 
(involving a tonic component), 83.5% had a multifocal or 
burst-suppression EEG, and 60 patients had mutations of 
the KCNQ2 gene. An analysis of this population showed 
specific combinations of semiology and EEG features: 
25.0% had tonic seizures associated to burst-suppression, 
21.7% had sequential seizures with burst-suppression, 
20.0% had sequential seizures with a multifocal EEG, and 
13.3% had tonic seizures and a multifocal EEG. 

4 | DISCUSSION 

This systematic review aimed to establish a relationship be-
tween electroclinical features and etiology of neonatal sei-
zures using existing studies published in the literature. The 
contribution of the present study to the extensive literature in 
this subject is the methodology applied. We have grouped the 
data of all the neonates from different authors and analyzed 
it as a large cohort, including specific information for each 
neonate. The observed associations may have a direct effect 

on clinical practice, mainly in institutions where continuous 
video-EEG is not available or not obtainable at all times.
