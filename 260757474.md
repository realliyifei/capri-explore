EPP0612 Anorexia nervosa and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: case report an literature review
*Corresponding author.
Introduction: Wenicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency. Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE) is the acute phase and the chronic phase is called Korsakoff-syndrome (KS). Objectives: To review the current literature on the management of WKS in a patient with anorexia nervosa. Methods: We report the case of a 63-year-old woman admitted to the Psychiatry Unit after weight loss in the last 3 months (from 39 kg to 33,500 kg). She only made one meal a day. By exploration and analysis, neoplastic disease is ruled out (thoraco-abdominopelvic CT without pathological findings). She has maintained restrictive intakes for more than 30 years. A long-term anorexia nervosa (AN) is suspected, with a worsening of restrictive behavior in recent months. Upon admission, she has a weight of 33,500 kg and a BMI of 14,10. She has a left palpebral ptosis and an alteration of the anterograde memory as well as affectation of executive functions. Progressive oral diet is started, and due to the suspicion of a WKS, thiamine ev is started for a week and then continued with oral thiamine. Thiamine levels are extracted once the ev treatment has begun, so we do not have previous levels to know if they were decreased. Brain MRI shows bilateral hyperintensities in white matter and at supratentorial level in T2 and FLAIR. After a month and a half of admission, the patient has progressively regained weight, has managed to make adequate intakes and has improvement in memory. Results: An adverse consequence of severe malnutrition in AN due to severe food restriction and purging behavior is thiamine deficiency, and also global cerebral atrophy and concomitant cognitive deficits can be found. Thiamine deficiency occurs in 38% of individuals with AN and is often unrecognized. WKS is caused by thiamine deficiency, and WE is the acute phase of this syndrome (presentation of triad can vary). The chronic phase is KS and consists in amnesia with confabulations. WKS typically develops after malnourishment in alcoholic patients but can be associated in nonalcoholic such as prolonged intravenous feeding, hyperemesis, anorexia nervosa, refeeding after starvation, thyrotoxicosis, malabsorption syndromes; hemodialysis; peritoneal dialysis; AIDS; malignancy. WKS is a clinical diagnosis, and no specific abnormalities have been found in cerebrospinal fluid, brain imaging or electroencephalograms. MRI has a sensitivity of 53%, but high specificity of 93%, and shows an increased signal in T2 and FLAIR sequences, bilaterally symmetrical in the paraventricular regions of the thalamus, the hypothalamus, mamillary bodies, the periaquedutal region, the floor of the fourth ventricle and midline cerebellum.

## Conclusions:

If the disorder is suspected, thiamine should be initiated immediately in order to prevent irreversible brain damage, with an estimated mortality rate of about 20%, or to the chronic form of the WE in up to 85% of survivors


## Disclosure of Interest: None Declared

Introduction: Besides the traditionally studied group of young females, disordered eating occurs in all age groups(Eedena, Hoekena, and Hoek 2021). In recent years, there has been an increase in the prevalence of eating disorders and symptoms in middle-aged and older women (40 years old and over)(Mangweth-Matzek and Hoek 2017). Experts in eating psychopathology in special groups such as Samuels, Maine and Taltillo (2019) suggest the use of the Screen for Disordered Eating (SDE;Magen et al. 2018)in the psychometric assessment of women in middle age and older. The SDE was developed to allow the Eating Disorders (ED) screening in Primary Health Care in people of all ages and without excluding Binge Eating Disorder (BED). The SDE is composed of five items (yes or no answers), extracted from other validated self-reported questionnaires for the assessment of eating psychopathology. Objectives: To analyze the psychometric properties of the Portuguese Version of the Screen for Disordered Eating in a sample of women from the general population aged 40 and over. Methods: Participants were 516 women with a mean age of 50.28 of years old (AE 8.063; range: 40-80). They answered an online survey including the preliminary Portuguese version of the SDE and the Portuguese version of the Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire (EDE-Q-7; Pereira et al. 2021). Results: Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed that the unidimensional model presented good fit indexes (χ 2 /df=1.502; RMSEA=.0311, p<.001; CFI=.987 TLI=.995, GFI=.965). The Cronbach's alfa was .762. All the items contributed to the internal consistency, as they presented item-total correlations above .40 and the exclusion of each one would decrease the alpha. Pearson correlations between SDE and the EDE-Q-7 were significant (p<.01), positive and moderate/high, as follows: .516 with the total score and .318, .503 and .536 respectively with the dimensional scores of Dietary restraint, Shape/weight overvaluation and Body dissatisfaction.S424e-Poster Presentation
