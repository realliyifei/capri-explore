Augochloropsis and other shiny green Halictinae have had various taxonomic issues and are often misidentified. One prevailing taxonomic issue is that Augochloropsis metallica (Fabricius) has two subspecies, that have long been recognized as morphologically distinct (Augochloropsis metallica metallica and Augochloropsis metallica fulgida (Smith), but the subspecies are inconsistently applied in the literature. Here, we review the Augochloropsis of the Midwest and further address the Augochloropsis species in the broader United States to resolve the outstanding taxonomic issues with the midwestern species. We provide identification keys and diagnoses for the genera and species of the shiny green Halictinae of the midwestern United States, which includes the genera Agapostemon, Augochlora, Augochlorella, and Augochloropsis. This work results in taxonomic changes to Augochloropsis. Augochloropsis sumptuosa (Smith) is split into two species, with the name Augochloropsis sumptuosa retained for the eastern form, and Augochloropsis humeralis (Patton), stat. nov., reinstated for the western form. Augochloropsis metallica is split into five species, with two of those species occurring in the midwestern United States: Augochloropsis metallica and Augochloropsis viridula (Smith), stat. nov. Examination of the holotype of Augochloropsis fulgida (Smith) revealed that it does not agree with the prevailing concept of Augochloropsis metallica fulgida; it is reinstated as Augochloropsis fulgida, stat. nov., but is currently known only from the holotype female from Florida. Augochloropsis cuprea (Smith), long considered to be a synonym of Augochloropsis metallica, is also distinct, and we are reinstating Augochloropsis cuprea, stat. nov., though the range of this species is unclear. We further recognize Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata (Friese), stat. nov., from South and Central America, as distinct. These changes result in a total of three Augochloropsis species in the Midwest and seven named species in the United States. We are aware of additional species from the southern and southwestern United States that are undescribed, and we highlight additional taxonomic work that remains to be done.

## Introduction

The genus Augochloropsis Cockerell contains approximately 140 species, recognizable by their metallic coloration and distinctly-shaped tegula (Hurd 1979;Engel 2000;Michener 2007;Ascher and Pickering 2022) and occurs throughout most of the Western Hemisphere (Moure and Hurd 1987). Augochloropsis was originally erected as a subgenus of Augochlora Say by Cockerell (1897) and later elevated to genus by Schrottky (1906). This classification was later confirmed by the in-depth generic revision of augochlorine bees by Eickwort (1969). The number of Augochloropsis species that occur in the United States has been a matter of some debate, with different authors variously claiming that there are anywhere from two to five species (Sandhouse 1937claimed two, Dreisbach 1945 claimed five, though did not list them all). In the most recent treatment, covering the Eastern United States, Mitchell (1960) recognized three species and one additional subspecies.

The species of Augochloropsis in the United States and Canada have undergone many taxonomic changes. In the first revisionary work, Sandhouse (1937) recognized two species: Augochloropsis caerulea (Ashmead) and Augochloropsis cuprea (Smith). Dreisbach (1945) recognized that what Sandhouse regarded as Augochloropsis cuprea was in fact two species in his region and split it into Augochloropsis cuprea and Augochloropsis viridula (Smith). Dreisbach (1945) also replaced the name Augochloropsis caerulea with the earlier name of Augochloropsis humeralis (Patton). After examination of the Fabricius types, and apparently unaware of the work by Dreisbach, Moure (1960) synonymized Augochloropsis cuprea with the older name Augochloropsis metallica (Fabricius). Moure (1960) also split Augochloropsis metallica into subspecies, suggesting Augochloropsis metallica fulgida (Smith) for the "southern variety." Moure's classification was followed by the most recent treatment performed by Mitchell (1960), who recognized two subspecies of Augochloropsis metallica, replaced the name Augochloropsis humeralis with Augochloropsis sumptuosa (Smith) based on correspondence with Moure, and recognized a third species, Augochloropsis anonyma Cockerell. There has been inconsistent use of the names and species concepts of the Augochloropsis in the United States in recent bee diversity studies, primarily with the usage of the subspecies of Augochloropsis metallica, with some researchers recognizing them and others not. As a result, when papers refer to "Augochloropsis metallica" it is often impossible to know whether they were referring to "Augochloropsis metallica metallica" or "Augochloropsis metallica fulgida," especially given that many publications fail to cite the identification resources or taxon concepts they used (see Packer et al. 2018). More recently, several authors have recognized four species of Augochloropsis in the United States, informally elevating the subspecies Augochloropsis metallica fulgida (Smith) to full species (e.g., Camilo et al. 2018;Stephenson et al. 2018;Decker et al. 2020), but this has not been widely adopted. Overall, this has made it difficult to compare different publications and has hindered our ability to build even a basic understanding of the ranges and patterns of occurrence of these two taxa.


## Results and systematics

Identification of the shiny green Halictinae of the midwestern United States.

Key to genera 1 Tegula enlarged and asymmetric, with the inner posterior margin hooked or angled (Fig. 1A) 


## Genus Agapostemon Guérin-Méneville

Diagnosis. Both sexes of Agapostemon are diagnosed by the complete carina on the rear face of the propodeum ( Fig. 2A, B). Other metallic green Halictinae genera, such as Augochloropsis, can have a pair of lateral carinae (e.g., Fig. 2C), but these are well-separated dorsally and never forming a complete carina as in Agapostemon.

Females can be further recognized by having the hind tibial spurs with broad teeth. Males can be further recognized by having the metasoma black and yellow striped rather than metallic green and by having the basitarsus fused with the next tarsal segment (Fig. 2E).  .

## Agapostemon (Agapostemon) angelicus Cockerell

Diagnosis. Females of Agapostemon angelicus can be recognized by the unique doublepunctate scutum (as in Fig. 5A), a character they share with Agapostemon texanus. Our efforts to find characters to separate the females of these two species for the most part have been fruitless, and like workers before us (Roberts 1972), we consider females of Agapostemon angelicus and Agapostemon texanus to be morphologically indistinguishable. Males of Agapostemon angelicus can be separated from males of Agapostemon texanus using the leg and genitalia characters given in the key.

Remarks. Agapostemon angelicus is primarily a western species, though Roberts (1972) records it from central Iowa and extreme eastern Kansas. As far as we have been able to determine, there are no recent records of Agapostemon angelicus east of the 98 th Meridian. A 2018-2019 statewide survey of Kansas bees by Morphew (2017) did not find any Agapostemon angelicus males (verified by MSA) east of the central part of the state, with  the easternmost records from Ellsworth and Rice counties. Recent survey efforts in eastern Nebraska have not found any Agapostemon angelicus east of the Grand Island area (Hall Co.). No confirmed recent records are known from Minnesota, Missouri, or Iowa, despite extensive collection efforts in those states. However, care should be taken to look for it and more work needs to be done to confirm the eastern extent of the range of Agapostemon angelicus. In areas where the two species may overlap, it is recommended that females identified morphologically as Agapostemon angelicus or Agapostemon texanus be treated as a single morphospecies. The two species can also be separated by DNA barcodes. *


## Agapostemon (Agapostemon) melliventris Cresson

Diagnosis. Female Agapostemon melliventris can be recognized by having the apex of the clypeus yellow as well as their non-metallic, light-colored metasoma. The terga are generally amber-colored but can be dark enough (e.g., Fig 4B) to resemble Agapostemon virescens.

Male Agapostemon melliventris can be recognized by having the metasoma primarily yellow (Fig. 9A), with just thin dark bands, and they also have the hind femur much skinnier (Fig. 8A) than any of the other species treated here. * Addendum -While this article was in press, a male Agapostemon angelicus was identified by ZP from southwestern Minnesota. It was collected in 2021 in Jackson County. This represents the first record of Agapostemon angelicus from Minnesota. Remarks. Agapostemon melliventris is not known from the midwestern US, though Roberts (1972) records if from eastern Nebraska and Kansas, so there is the potential for it to be found in Missouri and Iowa. We are not aware of any recent collections east of the 98 th Meridian.


## Agapostemon (Agapostemon) sericeus (Forster)

Diagnosis. The female of Agapostemon sericeus can be recognized by the combination of the metallic green metasoma (as in Fig. 4C) and the reticulate sculpturing of the scutum (Figs 5B, 6A). It is most similar to Agapostemon splendens, but Agapostemon splendens has the scutum more punctured (Fig. 6B) rather than reticulate, and Agapostemon sericeus can be further distinguished by its sharply angled dorsolateral ridge of the pronotum (Fig. 5B) and by having the ventral pleural tubercle flush with the plate (Fig. 6C).

Male Agapostemon sericeus have S3 and S4 with a low transverse swelling and generally have distinct yellow marks on the apical sterna ( Fig. 7C). They are most similar to males of Agapostemon texanus but can be distinguished by the relative lengths of F1 and F2: in Agapostemon sericeus F1 is slightly more than half the length of F2, whereas in Agapostemon texanus F1 is about three-fourths the length of F2 (Fig. 10). They can also be separated by the genitalia (see Roberts 1972).

Remarks. Agapostemon serieceus was previously known as Agapostemon radiatus (Say) (e.g., Mitchell 1960;Roberts 1972) but was synonymized by Day and Fitton (1977).

Females of Agapostemon femoratus Crawford, primarily a western species not recorded east of New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming by Roberts (1972), are essentially identical to females of Agapostemon sericeus, though the males are quite distinct, possessing a grossly enlarged hind femur, its width and length equal or nearly so. The key in Roberts (1972) indicates the scutum of female Agapostemon sericeus is more distinctly punctate than Agapostemon femoratus, but we do not consider this a reliable separating character. Curiously, there are several Missouri records of Agapostemon femoratus from the 1960s identified by Roberts in separate online databases, (discoverlife.org, Ascher and Pickering 2022), but these were not included in his 1972 revision. We have not seen these specimens, but assume they represent mis-determined females of Agapostemon sericeus, not Agapostemon femoratus.


## Agapostemon (Agapostemon) splendens (Lepeletier)

Diagnosis. The female of Agapostemon splendens can be recognized by the combination of the metallic green metasoma (as in Fig. 4C) and the coarsely punctured sculpturing of the scutum (Figs 5C, 6B). It is similar to Agapostemon sericeus, but that species has the sculpturing of the scutum more reticulate (Figs 4B, 6A). Agapostemon splendens can be further distinguished by the obtuse dorsolateral ridge (Fig. 5C), the upraised ventral pleural tubercle (Fig. 6D), and it is generally larger than Agapostemon sericeus (though their sizes can intergrade).

Male Agapostemon splendens can be recognized from all other midwestern Agapostemon by their very enlarged hind femur, with the length twice the width (Fig. 8C). They also tend to be larger than related species and have darker wings, but this character is subtle.

Remarks. Some previous works (e.g., Mitchell (1960) and the keys on discoverlife. org) have used the shape of the ridges of the propodeal triangle (which often form a depressed medial triangle) to separate female Agapostemon splendens from Agapostemon sericeus (which have parallel striae throughout the propodeal triangle), but we have found the character variable and it can be quite subtle, particularly in smaller Agapostemon splendens. Agapostemon splendens is largely restricted to areas of deep sands. We have examined material from throughout the range of Agapostemon splendens, and there are many individuals, especially in the southern US, that have the scutal sculpturing more reticulate, similar to Agapostemon sericeus. More work is needed to determine whether this represents normal variation or is potentially due to a cryptic species complex.


## Agapostemon (Agapostemon) texanus Cresson

Diagnosis. The females of Agapostemon texanus have the metasoma metallic green (Fig. 4C) and can be recognized by the "double-punctured" scutum, which has a combination of intermixed large and small punctures (Fig. 5A). Females cannot be reliably distinguished from Agapostemon angelicus, so they should be separated based on range or DNA barcodes (see remarks for Agapostemon angelicus above).

Male Agapostemon texanus have S3 and S4 with a low transverse swelling and generally have distinct yellow marks on the apical sterna (Fig. 7B, D). They are extremely similar to Agapostemon angelicus, but Agapostemon texanus have the hind tibia with black stripes on the front and back (Fig. 8D), whereas Agapostemon angelicus has the hind tibia yellow anteriorly (Fig. 11). In addition, the two species can be separated based on the genitalia characters given in the key (Fig. 12), and at least in the midwestern US, the range of the two species largely does not overlap.

Male Agapostemon texanus are also similar to (and frequently misidentified as) Agapostemon sericeus but can be distinguished based on the relative lengths of F1 and F2: Agapostemon texanus has F1 about three-fourths the length of F2 (Fig. 10A), whereas Agapostemon sericeus has F1 slightly more than half the length of F2 (Fig. 10B).

Remarks. Agapostemon texanus and Agapostemon angelicus largely do not overlap in range in the midwestern region, though Roberts (1972) reports Agapostemon angelicus from Iowa and eastern Kansas (see remarks under Agapostemon angelicus, above).


## Agapostemon (Agapostemon) virescens (Fabricius)

Diagnosis. Females of Agapostemon virescens are the only midwestern species that has the metasoma dark ( Fig. 4A), rather than metallic green (but see comments on dark Agapostemon melliventris).

Males of Agapostemon virescens can be recognized by the lack of a transverse swelling on S4 (Fig. 7A). In addition, S5 and S6 are usually all dark (Fig. 7A), whereas those sterna usually (though not always) have at least some yellow in other Agapostemon species. Finally, Agapostemon virescens males have a relatively slender hind femur compared to most other midwestern Agapostemon species (see Fig. 8E).

Remarks. Two western species with females with non-metallic metasomas have been recorded from nearby states though they have not been recorded from Iowa, Minnesota, or Missouri. Agapostemon melliventris has been found as far east as eastern Kansas and Nebraska, but they have the metasoma lighter and the apex of the clypeus yellow, compared to black in Agapostemon virescens females. In addition, Agapostemon coloradinus (Vachal) is a Great Plains species which occurs as far east as eastern Kansas, though Agapostemon coloradinus is usually noticeably larger than Agapostemon virescens with finer, closer striations on the hypostomal area on the underside of the head (see Roberts 1972). Males of Agapostemon coloradinus are similar to males of Agapostemon virescens, but Agapostemon coloradinus males have a dark stripe on the posterior surface of the hind femur and the inner gonostylar flap of Agapostemon coloradinus lacks a pronounced, medially-directed process basally, which is present in Agapostemon virescens.


## Genus Augochlorella Sandhouse

Diagnosis. The genus Augochlorella can be recognized by the combination of a normal oval-shaped tegula (as in Fig. 1B), the incomplete carina on the rear face of the propodeum (Fig. 2D), and the lack of a protruding paraocular lobe (Fig. 3D, F). Females lack the keel on S1 seen in Augochlora and they have simple hind tibial spurs. Males are quite similar to Augochlora, but Augochlorella males have the S4 apical margin weakly to strongly concave, versus straight in Augochlora. In addition, Augochlorella males lack distinct punctures on the rear of the propodeum (Fig. 2D) compared to Augochlora males which do have distinct punctures (Fig. 3B). Some Augochlorella are more of a greenish-bronze color.


## Keys to the midwestern species of Augochlorella

Key to females 1 Propodeal triangle with striae continuing to posterior margin, or very nearly so 


## Augochlorella aurata (Smith)

Diagnosis. Augochlorella aurata is very similar to Augochlorella persimilis. Female Augochlorella aurata can be recognized by having the striations of the propodeum continuing to the posterior margin ( Fig. 13C-E), which often, but not always, is bordered by a carina (e.g., Fig. 13C). In contrast, females of Augochlorella persimilis always have a distinct smooth portion before the margin of the propodeum ( Fig. 13F-H). In addition, female Augochlorella aurata are generally larger, have the head slightly longer and the apex of the clypeus is black only on the apical fourth (Fig. 13A). In contrast, Augochlorella persimilis females are generally quite small, have the head slightly broader, and the apex of the clypeus is black on the apical third (Fig. 13B).

Female Augochlorella aurata are also often confused with Augochlora pura, but Augochlorella aurata have the paraocular lobes less protuberant (Fig. 3D, F) than Augochlora pura, and Augochlorella aurata also lack a keel on S1.

Male Augochlorella aurata can be separated from Augochlorella persimilis by the hair on the apical two-thirds of the inner edge of the hind basitarsus, which is short in Augochlorella aurata, with the length of the hairs about equal to the width of the basitarsus (Fig.13I), whereas Augochlorella persimilis has the hairs distinctly longer than the width of the basitarsus (Fig. 13J). In addition, the striae on the propodeal triangle of Augochlorella aurata reach the posterior margin (as in Fig. 13C-E) whereas male Augochlorella persimilis generally have a smooth portion before the margin.

Male Augochlorella aurata are often confused with Augochlora pura males, but Augochlorella aurata have the margin of S4 concave rather than straight, and they lack distinct punctures on the rear of the propodeum (Fig. 2D), compared to distinctly punctured in Augochlora pura (Fig. 3B).

Comments. Augochlorella aurata and Augochlorella persimilis are often confused in collections and some females can intergrade to the degree where they are impossible to differentiate. Males are also frequently confused because the hind basitarsus character is often misinterpreted since both species have the basal third of the basitarsus with distinctly shorter hairs, which can cause confusion in keys that focus on the length of the basal hairs rather than the apical hairs, such as Coelho (2004), or the keys on discoverlife.org that incorrectly state that Augochlorella aurata males have the "hair on rear basitarsus all about the same length".

Given the high level of variation in Augochlorella aurata, it seems likely that it is a species complex. Supporting this hypothesis are the various forms that Ordway (1966) recognized, one of which was elevated to species rank by Coelho (2004), as well as the high barcode diversity found in the species (Sheffield et al. 2009).


## Augochlorella persimilis (Viereck)

Diagnosis. Augochlorella persimilis is very similar to Augochlorella aurata. Females can be distinguished by the lack of rugae at the rear of the propodeal triangle, though this character can often be subtle (Fig. 13F-H). In addition, Augochlorella persimilis tend to be smaller than Augochlorella aurata, and they have a more extensive apical black mark on the clypeus, with the black part taking up approximately one-third of the length of the clypeus (Fig. 13B), compared to approximately one-fourth the length of the clypeus in Augochlorella aurata (Fig. 13A). Note that there are often females of Augochlorella persimilis and Augochlorella aurata that cannot be reliably separated.

Male Augochlorella persimilis can be separated from Augochlorella aurata by the length of the hairs on the inner side of the hind basitarsus: Augochlorella persimilis have the hairs very short for the basal third, then the hairs flare out to about twice the width of the basitarsus (Fig. 13J). In contrast, the hairs on Augochlorella aurata are short for the basal third, and only get slightly longer, about equal in length to the width of the basitarsus (Fig. 13I). Like females, the males of Augochlorella persimilis also have a lack of rugae at the rear of the propodeal triangle but it is less distinct (see Fig. 13F-H).

Comments. This species has a more southern distribution than Augochlorella aurata, though the species commonly overlap and co-occur. The northern extent of the range of Augochlorella persimilis reaches the southern part of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin (Wolf and Ascher 2008;Gibbs et al. 2017).


## Genus Augochlora Smith

Comments. Augochlora pura is the only species of Augochlora that occurs in the midwestern United States.


## Augochlora (Augochlora) pura (Say)

Diagnosis. Augochlora pura is most similar to Augochlorella aurata and Augochlorella persimilis. Both sexes of Augochlora pura can be recognized by the distinct and prominent facial lobes (Fig. 3C, E), which extend below the level of the base of the mandible and are stronger than those found in Augochlorella, but the difference is subtle and easy to confuse. Female Augochlora pura are unique in having a keel on S1 (Fig. 3A) and the hind tibial spur is simple. In addition, the mandibles of Augochlora pura females are more robust, with 2 distinct and nearly equally-sized apical teeth, whereas Augochlorella have 1 main tooth and a smaller subapical tooth.

Males of Augochlora pura can be further recognized from Augochlorella by their straight apical margin on S4 (compared to concave in Augochlorella) and they have distinct punctures on the rear of the propodeum (Fig. 3B), compared to impunctate or obscure punctures in Augochlorella males (Fig 2D).

Comments. Augochlora and Augochlorella are frequently confused in collections, especially males. Midwestern specimens of Augochlora pura fall under subspecies Augochlora pura pura. More work is needed to determine whether Augochlora pura pura and Augochlora pura mosieri Cockerell are distinct taxa.


## Genus Augochloropsis Cockerell

Diagnosis. Both sexes of Augochloropsis are diagnosed by the unique shape of the tegula, which has the inner posterior margin hooked (Fig. 1A). Females have the inner hind tibial spur with multiple straight teeth compared to broad teeth in Agapostemon or untoothed spurs in Augochlorella and Augochlora. Augochloropsis males have a uniquelyshaped S4 (see Fig. 20C, H, M), with a median point and lateral arms, though the sternum is typically hidden. Though typically strongly metallic green, many individuals are metallic bluish or even purplish.


## Keys to the midwestern species of Augochloropsis

Key to females 1

Vertex (in frontal view) rising above ocelli by at least one ocellar diameter (Fig. 14A); dorsolateral angle of pronotum strongly lamellate, lamella produced as a strong right angle or nearly so (Fig. 14D); terga dull, strongly tessellate, with surfaces appearing granular, even on apical rims of terga ( T2 with apical fringe of distinctly thickened hairs (Fig. 16H); terga densely punctate, with punctures on T2 typically 1-2 puncture widths apart (Fig. 16H); propodeal triangle not as shiny, and more sculptured, than in viridula; genitalia with lateral margins of gonostyli parallel (Fig. 20F) .........metallica (Fabricius) -T2 with apical fringe composed of unthickened hairs (Fig. 16I); T2 surface shining (Fig. 16H), and T2 punctures more widely separated, typically 2-4 puncture widths apart; propodeal triangle shiny and less sculptured than in metallica; genitalia with lateral margins of gonostyli diverging apically (Fig. 20K)    Midwestern Augochloropsis species Augochloropsis humeralis is similar in most respects to Augochloropsis sumptuosa. The females can be separated by the more densely punctate metasomal terga: Augochloropsis humeralis has the punctures on T1 and T2 close together and separated by about one puncture width (at least over most of the terga), whereas Augochloropsis sumptuosa has the punctures always well-separated (about 3-5 puncture widths apart). In addition, females of Augochloropsis sumptuosa have a weak but distinct semicircular carina around the propodeal triangle (Fig. 17D), which Augochloropsis humeralis lacks (Fig. 17A). More work is needed on how to separate the males of Augochloropsis sumptuosa, but the male of Augochloropsis humeralis appears to have the median emargination of S4 more acute (Fig. 20C), compared to more rounded truncate in Augochloropsis sumptuosa (see Mitchell 1960: fig 111 (mislabeled as S5)), though this character is variable and it's not clear how reliable it is.

Comments. What has previously been called Augochloropsis sumptuosa by Mitchell (1960) is not a single species but rather a species complex. Therefore, we have reinstated the name Augochloropsis humeralis Patton for the species occurring in the midwestern United States and retained the name Augochloropsis sumptuosa Smith for the species occurring in the southeastern United States. The exact extent of the range of Augochloropsis sumptuosa is unclear, and it is not clear to what extent the ranges of Augochloropsis humeralis and Augochloropsis sumptuosa may overlap. However, we have so far found no evidence that the two species overlap in range, with Augochloropsis sumptuosa appearing to be limited to the east coast of the United States and Augochloropsis humeralis appearing to be limited to the prairie region (Fig. 18). Historic records of Augochloropsis sumptuosa from Ohio were found to be misidentified Augochloropsis metallica. Since the identity of the midwestern species is clear, we have decided to proceed with a formal split; further delineation of the range of Augochloropsis sumptuosa must be accomplished in future research.

Two syntypes of Augochloropsis humeralis (1 male and 1 female) were located in the ANSP collection, where Sandhouse (1937) reported examining them. Though the specimens are undated and not clearly labeled as type specimens, the labels indicate that they are from the type locality. In addition, the specimens bear labels stating "Augochlora humeralis n.s." and "Augochlora humeralis n.sp.". The combination of the little-used name, the "n. sp.", the type locality, and the fact that Sandhouse (1937) considered these types, makes us confident that these are indeed Patton's syntypes. As a result, we have designated the female as the lectotype, making the male a paralectotype. Additional paralectotypes may potentially be present at the Smithsonian, as Titus (1901) states "Mr. Ashmead very kindly examined specimens in the U.S.N.M. of A. humeralis Patt., marked 'N. W. Kans., Williston'". However, our inquiries to the Smithsonian have received no answer. Sandhouse (1937) considered the name Augochloropsis caerulea (Ashmead) to have priority because the name humeralis is a secondary homonym in the genus Halictus. However, humeralis is not a secondary homonym in the genus Augochloropsis and the substitute name is no longer in use, so following IZCN Article 59.3, the name humeralis is available and has priority.

Augochlora sumptuosa bolliana Cockerell is from Texas and was synonymized with Augochloropsis sumptuosa by Sandhouse (1937). Based on the online images of one of the syntypes, we are tentatively assigning it as a synonym of Augochloropsis humeralis, but a more critical evaluation of the specimen, with additional Texas material, should be performed.


## Range.

Augochloropsis humeralis occurs throughout the prairie region, ranging from North Dakota and Minnesota south to New Mexico and Texas, extending to Colorado in the west and Indiana in the east (Fig. 18). Specimens from Indiana Dunes National Park represent the easternmost records.

Biology. Augochloropsis humeralis is polylectic and nests are associated with deep sand (MA, pers. obs.). The sociality and the specifics of the nesting biology are unknown.   Vachal, 1903: 136 ♀ (syn. by Sandhouse 1937[under cuprea], syn. by Mitchell 1960). Lectotype: ♀ USA, Georgia (designated by Moure and Hurd 1987). Not examined. Megilla metallica (in Fabricius 1804: taxonomy). Augochlora fervida (in Robertson 1895: taxonomy;Robertson 1902: key;Cockerell 1906: notes). Augochloropsis cuprea (in Sandhouse 1937 [in part]: key;Lovell 1942: key;Dreisbach 1945: key). Augochloropsis (Paraugochloropsis) metallica metallica (in Mitchell 1960: key, redescription;Hurd 1979: catalog;Moure and Hurd 1987: catalog). Augochloropsis (Paraugochloropsis) metallica (in Stephenson et al. 2018: checklist;Camilo et al. 2018: checklist;Decker et al. 2020: checklist).

Diagnosis. Both sexes of Augochloropsis metallica are most similar to Augochloropsis viridula, but Augochloropsis metallica can be separated from Augochloropsis viridula by the thicker hair fringe on the apical edge of T1 and T2; Augochloropsis metallica has the hairs noticeably thicker than the other hairs of the metasoma (Figs 14H, 15A, 16H), whereas the fringe hairs of Augochloropsis viridula are not noticeably thicker than the other metasomal hairs (Figs 14I, 15B, 16I). In addition, the terga of Augochloropsis metallica are more closely punctured, separated by about one puncture width on T2 (Fig. 14H, 16H), whereas the terga of Augochloropsis viridula are more sparsely punctured and separated by at least 2-4 puncture widths on T2 (Figs 14I, 16I). Both sexes of Augochloropsis metallica can be separated from Augochloropsis humeralis by the shape of the pronotal flange and angle, which is smaller and has an obtuse lateral angle in Augochloropsis metallica (Figs 14E, 16E), compared to the larger flange and 90-degree lateral angle in Augochloropsis humeralis (Figs 14D, 16D). In addition, Augochloropsis metallica has the metasomal terga shining, with at most weak tessellation (Figs 14H, 16H), whereas Augochloropsis humeralis has the metasomal terga strongly and densely tessellate, resulting in dull, silky coloration (Figs 14G, 16G).

Comments. The holotype of Augochloropsis metallica (Fig. 19) is missing its head, but the punctures and hair bands on the metasoma, combined with the locality of "America" (Moure (1960) states "probably middle eastern U.S.A.") are sufficient to confirm its identity.

We define Augochloropsis metallica in a much more restricted sense than previous authors, who lumped multiple taxa under Augochloropsis metallica (e.g., Sandhouse 1937;Mitchell 1960). We are here splitting Augochloropsis metallica (as defined by Mitchell 1960) into five taxa: A. metallica, A. cuprea, A. fulgida, A. fulvofimbriata, and A. viridula. In the original revision of the Augochloropsis of the United States, Sandhouse (1937) lumped at least six distinct taxa under the name Augochloropsis cuprea (Table 1). One reason for this over-lumping appears to be that Sandhouse (1937) did not actually examine any of the type specimens, and synonymized many species based on the description alone or through correspondence. Examination of Sandhouse-determined material in the UMSP shows that she consistently lumped specimens of Augochloropsis metallica, Augochloropsis viridula, and a third unknown species together. Mitchell (1960) clearly recognized that Augochloropsis metallica and Augochloropsis viridula [as Augochloropsis metallica fulgida] were distinct, and it is unclear why he only split them into subspecies.

The traditional view that Augochloropsis metallica extends down through Mexico and Central America is almost certainly incorrect and merely an artifact of the erroneously broad definition of the species adopted by previous workers. Though we have examined relatively little material from south of the United States, the material we have examined has not matched any of the US Augochloropsis treated here. The synonymy of Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata Friese, described from Costa Rica, is almost certainly incorrect. The source of the synonymy of Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata was originally made by Sandhouse (1937), who synonymized the male of Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata under Augochloropsis ignita and the female of Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata under Augochloropsis cuprea. However, Michener (1954), in his revision of the bees of Panama, treated Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata as valid, and though he did not mention the synonymy of A. fulvofimbriata under Augochloropsis cuprea, he did state about A. fulvofimbriata: "Sandhouse incorrectly placed this species in the synonymy if [sic] ignita." Based on that, Michener (1954) clearly considered Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata a valid species (and he certainly would have been familiar with Augochloropsis metallica, which was then called A. cuprea). Moure (1960) did not list Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata as a synonym of Augochloropsis metallica metallica. However, following that, the works of Mitchell (1960), Hurd (1979), Moure and Hurd (1987), and Moure et al. (2007) all treat Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata as a synonym of Augochloropsis metallica metallica, but none of them indicate it is a new synonym, which suggests they were just carrying over the synonymy by Sandhouse (1937). Here, though we have not examined any material of Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata, we follow the classification of Michener (1954) who was the last worker to treat the species, and we formally treat Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata Friese (stat. nov.), as valid. This is supported by the findings of Celis and Cure (2017), who recognized Augochloropsis fulvofimbriata and even classified it in a separate subgenus than Augochloropsis metallica (Augochloropsis s.s. rather than Paraugochloropsis).

Another synonym with issues is Augochloropsis chorisis Vachal, which was originally synonymized under Augochloropsis cuprea by Sandhouse (1937) and listed as a synonym of Augochloropsis metallica metallica by Michell (1960). The type series of Augochloropsis chorisis contains specimens ranging from Georgia and Texas to Brazil (Rasmussen 2012), making it undoubtedly a composite series (Cockerell 1949). The specimen from Georgia was designated as a lectotype by Moure and Hurd (1987), who considered it a synonym of Augochloropsis metallica metallica. We have not been able to examine the lectotype which cannot be located at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, France (A. Touret-Alby, pers. comm.) and we are nominally accepting the synonymy. Augochlora (Augochloropsis) cleomis was described from a male and female specimen from near Fort Collins, Colorado (Titus 1901). The types were not examined and it is not entirely clear from the description whether it is a synonym of Augochloropsis metallica or Augochloropsis humeralis. It was originally synonymized with Augochloropsis cuprea by Sandhouse (1937) and was later synonymized with Augochloropsis metallica metallica by Moure (1960). Sandhouse (1937) did not examine any specimens and it is unclear whether Moure (1960) did. Regardless, it is likely a synonym of Augochloropsis metallica, so we are nominally accepting the synonym.

Biology. Augochloropsis metallica is polylectic and nests in the ground. However, the specifics of the nesting biology and sociality are unknown. Augochloropsis metallica is often associated with sandy areas, and it has been found in natural habitats (e.g., native prairies, wetlands), as well as disturbed sites and urban areas.

Range. Augochloropsis metallica occurs in the eastern states and across the Great Plains (Fig. 21A). Recent surveys (2009 to present) by MSA and co-workers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska have found Augochloropsis metallica throughout these states and further to the west (whereas Augochloropsis viridula is absent from those western areas).

Material   Stephenson et al. 2018: checklist;Camilo et al. 2018: checklist;Decker et al. 2020: checklist).

Diagnosis. Both sexes of Augochloropsis viridula can be recognized primarily by the lack of a thickened hair fringe on T1 and T2; the hairs that are present along the margin are slender and the same size and width as the rest of the hairs on the terga (Fig. 15B). This is in contrast to the females of Augochloropsis metallica which have the fringe hairs noticeably thickened (Fig. 15A). In addition, the terga of Augochloropsis viridula are more shining and sparsely punctured, and this is most apparent on T1 and T2, with punctures on T2 separated by at least 2-4 puncture widths on T2 (Figs 14I, 16I). In contrast, Augochloropsis metallica has the punctures on T1 and T2 closer together (punctures typically separated by 1-2 puncture widths on T2) and the interspaces between the punctures have slight tessellation, though they are still somewhat shining (Figs 14H, 16H). Augochloropsis viridula can be separated from Augochloropsis humeralis by its less developed pronotal flange, which is weak and forms an obtuse angle in Augochloropsis viridula (Figs 14F, 16F) compared to extensive and forming a right angle in Augochloropsis humeralis (Figs 14D, 16D), and Augochloropsis viridula has the terga smooth and shining (Figs 14I, 16I), compared to heavily tessellate and dull in Augochloropsis humeralis (Figs 14G, 16G).

Augochloropsis viridula can be separated from Augochloropsis anonyma and Augochloropsis fulgida by the relative lack of black hairs on the metasoma, having at most a few scattered black hairs on the apical terga (Fig.14I), compared to copious black hairs over most of the terga in Augochloropsis anonyma and Augochloropsis fulgida (Fig. 23C, D).

Biology. Augochloropsis viridula is a polylectic ground-nester. Nesting and sociality were documented by Gibbs (2017) [as Augochloropsis metallica fulgida]. Gibbs (2017) found a nest with two females, one of which had undeveloped ovaries and could have been a worker, suggesting that this bee may be primitively eusocial, however more work is needed to understand the degree of sociality of this species. (Fig. 21B). It does not spread as far west as Augochloropsis metallica (see Fig. 21A), and recent surveys (2009 to present) by MSA and co-workers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska have found viridula only on the extreme eastern margins of these states, while metallica has been found throughout these states and further to the west. Mitchell records it [as metallica fulgida] extending south to Florida, though we have not evaluated material from the purported southernmost portion of the range.


## Range. Augochloropsis viridula occurs throughout the eastern United States

Comments. This species has historically been referred to as Augochloropsis metallica fulgida sensu Mitchell (1960). However, after examination of the holotype of Augochloropsis fulgida (Fig. 23), we found that it does not match the species concept used by Mitchell (1960) for Augochloropsis metallica fulgida. As a result, we resurrect the name Augochloropsis viridula (Smith), which was previously used by Robertson (1902) and Dreisbach (1945). Augochloropsis fulgida is reinstated as a separate species (see remarks for that species).

The species-level (rather than subspecies-level) recognition of Augochloropsis metallica and Augochloropsis viridula (previously classified as Augochloropsis metallica metallica and Augochloropsis metallica fulgida, respectively, by Mitchell (1960)) is supported by multiple characters, including the hair fringe on T2 (see Fig. 15A, B), difference in the degree of punctures and tessellation, the male terminalia, and differences in the extent of range. In particular, the male terminalia are distinct, with Augochloropsis metallica having the gonostyli more expanded (Fig. 20F, G), the gonocoxites more parallel-sided (Fig. 20F, G), the lateral arms of S4 more straight (Fig.  20H), and the lateral apodemes of S7 wider (Fig. 20J), in comparison, Augochloropsis viridula have the gonostyli narrower (Fig. 20K, L), the gonocoxites diverging apically (Fig. 20K, L), the lateral arms of S4 more curved (Fig. 20M), and the lateral apodemes of S7 narrower (Fig. 20O). The shape of S8 (Fig. 20I, N) appears to be too variable to be useful as a splitting character.

That Augochloropsis viridula (Smith) and Augochloropsis lucidula (Smith) were different sexes of the same species was recognized by Patton (1879), Robertson (1895), andCockerell (1905). However, both names were synonymized under Augochloropsis cuprea (along with Augochloropsis anonyma) by Sandhouse (1937). The name Augochloropsis viridula was then correctly applied by Dreisbach (1945). Mitchell (1960) clearly did not consider viridula and lucidula conspecific as he considered Augochloropsis viridula a junior synonym of Augochloropsis metallica metallica and Augochloropsis lucidula a junior synonym of Augochloropsis metallica fulgida. Moure (1960) considered both viridula and lucidula junior synonyms of Augochloropsis metallica. Here, after examination of the primary types, we agree with the interpretation of Patton (1879) and Robertson (1895) in considering Augochloropsis viridula and Augochloropsis lucidula as both conspecific and a true species.

In the generic revision of augochlorine bees by Eickwort (1969), the subspecies of Augochloropsis metallica were not recognized. However, the illustrations of the genitalia and other characters are clearly of Augochloropsis viridula (rather than Augochloropsis metallica) based on the apically diverging lateral margins of the gonostyli.  Diagnosis. Both sexes of Augochloropsis anonyma can be recognized by the short propodeal triangle, which is impressed and narrower than the metanotum (Fig. 17E).

Augochloropsis anonyma are most likely to be confused with Augochloropsis viridula, as they overlap in range, and both have shining integument and poorly developed apical hair fringes on the metasoma. Augochloropsis anonyma females can be recognized by the presence of dark pubescence on T2-T4, whereas Augochloropsis viridula lacks dark pubescence. In addition, Augochloropsis anonyma has the propodeum dorsal surface impressed, shining, and relatively narrow with its medial length slightly less than the medial length of the metanotum (Fig. 17E). In comparison, Augochloropsis viridula has the propodeum dorsal surface flat throughout, not impressed, and relatively broad, its medial length dorsally as long (or longer) than the medial length of the metanotum (Fig. 17C).

Augochloropsis anonyma is also similar to Augochloropsis fulgida because both share the character of dark hairs on the metasoma (see Fig. 23C, D for fulgida). However, the narrow propodeal triangle of Augochloropsis anonyma (Fig. 17E) separates these two species, as Augochloropsis fulgida has the propodeal triangle broader (visible in Fig. 23C).

Comments. Augochloropsis anonyma is known from the far southeastern US, and we have examined material from Florida and Georgia (Fig. 18). Mitchell (1960) reports it occurring as far north as North Carolina. Comments. The type of Augochloropsis cuprea (Fig. 22) was located in the Oxford Museum, and based on the label, it was examined by J.S. Moure in 1957 andC.D. Michener in 1965. The specimen is not clearly labeled as the type, but both Moure and Michener agreed that it was likely the holotype. Sandhouse (1937) appears to have only examined the type by proxy through sawfly taxonomist R. B. Benson and Mitchell (1960) did not examine it.


## Augochloropsis

Augochloropsis cuprea was considered a junior synonym of Augochloropsis metallica metallica by both Moure (1960) and Mitchell (1960). However, examination of the type of Augochloropsis cuprea reveals that it is distinct from Augochloropsis metallica based on the short T2 fringe (Fig. 22D), the relatively short T3 impressed area (Fig. 22D), the presence of some black hairs on the metasoma (Fig. 22A, D), the more shining propodeum (Fig. 22C), and the short posterior carina of the propodeum (Fig. 22C,  D). As a result, we recognize the two forms as heterospecific and thus Augochloropsis cuprea as a valid species.

The range of Augochloropsis cuprea is unclear as Smith (1853) reports the type locality as "North America". We have in our possession a single female from Oklahoma (from Four Canyon Preserve headquarters, Ellis County) that may be a match for Augochloropsis cuprea, but this must be considered tentative, especially since the Oklahoma specimen lacks the number of black hairs on the metasoma seen in the type. There is also the possibility that Augochloropsis cuprea is a Mexican species, especially since multiple Mexican species share the character of the broadly shiny propodeal triangle. The male remains unknown and additional investigation, with more material, is sorely needed. Comments. We use Augochloropsis sumptuosa in a more restricted sense than previous authors because we have split it into two species: Augochloropsis sumptuosa and Augochloropsis humeralis. Now, Augochloropsis sumptuosa refers to the species occurring in the southeastern United States though the exact range is unknown at this time, and it remains to be seen to what degree, if any, the range of the two species overlaps.

The type or types of Augochloropsis sumptuosa have been lost. The type could not be located by Sandhouse (1937) or Mitchell (1960). The last report of possible types is from Cockerell (1897), who stated that "Col. C.T. Bingham" examined syntypes in the Natural History Museum (London, UK). However, there are currently no specimens in the Natural History Museum that could possibly be syntypes (J. Monks, pers. comm., Jun 2021). Despite the missing types, it is our opinion that there is not a need for a neotype because the identity of Augochloropsis sumptuosa can be determined from the original description. Specifically, the original description states "the base of the metathorax enclosed by an arched ridge, the enclosed space granulated, the sides of the truncation margined by sharp carinae." This description matches the southeastern species (which has the propodeal triangle surrounded by a weak semicircular carina; Fig. 17D) but not the species found in the Midwest. On this basis, we are retaining the name Augochloropsis sumptuosa Smith for the southeastern species. The oldest available name for the midwestern species is Augochloropsis humeralis (Patton), the types of which were collected in western Kansas.

More work remains to be done on the taxonomy of Augochloropsis sumptuosa because we have not critically evaluated the status of two synonyms: Augochlora lacustris Cockerell and Augochlora floridica Cockerell. They were originally synonymized with Augochloropsis sumptuosa by Sandhouse (1937), andMitchell (1960) agreed with that designation, stating "Examination of the types has failed to reveal any significant difference that would justify the recognition of either lacustris or floridica." We have examined images of the types, which are clear enough for us to tentatively agree. However, given that we have split Augochloropsis sumptuosa into two species and there is potentially a third similar species in Florida, these types should be critically reexamined as part of a reevaluation of the Florida fauna.


## Additional unknown Augochloropsis species in the United States

We are aware of at least four additional potential species of Augochloropsis in the United States. We are listing them here in order to alert readers to their presence, as many have been incorrectly lumped together under existing species, particularly Augochloropsis metallica. However, we do not treat them further. We lack sufficient material of these species, and it is unknown whether they are undescribed or not, as they may be described from Mexico or they may be one of the many poorly known species described by Cockerell. The potential species and their locations include:

• Arizona: A species with a broad and shining propodeum in the female (M. Arduser, unpublished).

• Florida: A species similar to Augochloropsis sumptuosa seen in material from Archbold Biological Station (M. Arduser, unpublished).

• Texas: A species that has a unique propodeal triangle (Fig. 17F) and an intermediate T2 comb (Fig. 15C) that falls between Augochloropsis metallica and Augochloropsis viridula (Z. Portman, unpublished; from material in UMSP and OSUC). This species may have contributed to the confusion by previous authors who believed that Augochloropsis metallica and Augochloropsis viridula were a single variable species.

• Texas: A species similar to Augochloropsis humeralis (M. Arduser, unpublished).


## Conclusions

Here, we have revised the Augochloropsis of the Midwest and made additional changes to the Augochloropsis of the broader United States. This work will allow for the confident identification of the species in the midwestern United States and allow the species' ranges to be better understood. However, there are areas of the southern United States (particularly Florida and Texas) where any Augochloropsis identifications must be undertaken with great care due to the number of undescribed or unknown species. We estimate there are an additional four species of Augochloropsis in the United States that are unknown or undescribed, not counting Augochloropsis fulgida, which is only known from the type and has the male now unknown. In addition, more work needs to be done to check the status of some of the current synonyms of Augochloropsis sumptuosa and Augochloropsis humeralis from Texas and Florida. Even the genus name may change at some point, as Gonçalves et al. (2022) advocate for raising the subgenus Paraugochloropsis to genus level. The taxonomic changes and identification resources provided here will allow for more accurate identification of Augochloropsis and the other shiny green Halictinae. However, similar to the situation in Augochloropsis, more taxonomic work is still needed in the other shiny green Halictinae. For example the Agapostemon of the United States were last revised 50 years ago (Roberts 1972;Janjic and Packer 2003;Sheffield et al. 2021), the Augochlora of the United States have never been revised, and the molecular and morphological diversity found in Augochlorella aurata suggests it is potentially a cryptic species complex (Ordway 1966;Sheffield et al. 2009). Given the identification issues surrounding what were the former Augochloropsis metallica subspecies, it is especially important that researchers cite the taxonomic concepts and identification resources they use and save voucher specimens (see Packer et al. 2018). In addition, we recommend that non-peer-reviewed identification resources should be avoided whenever possible, as they often have errors and lack a version of record. Indeed, many non-peer-reviewed works would not pass peer review, and the widespread use of these error-ridden and out-of-date identification resources (particularly the keys on discoverlife.org) are contributing to the high rates of misidentifications in bees.

Our work also demonstrates the difficulty, indeed the futility, of attempting to monitor many bee groups that are in taxonomic disarray Tepedino and Portman 2021). Here, we have altered the species concept of essentially every Augochloropsis species in the United States and split what was formerly Augochloropsis metallica into five species (Table 1). This will necessitate that the majority of existing identifications be checked and updated, which is impossible for monitoring schemes or other studies that do not preserve their specimens (Packer et al. 2018), and it demonstrates one of the major issues with digitizing old museum specimens without first updating them to modern taxonomic concepts. While the taxonomic changes made here will no doubt cause headaches as specimens are checked and names updated, this is a predictable consequence of a genus going 60+ years without a revision. The taxonomic issues seen in Augochloropsis are not an isolated problem, as demonstrated by the high rate of new species described in recent revisions of the North American bee fauna (e.g., 15 new species of Epeolus (Onuferko 2018); 20 new species of "red-tailed" Lasioglossum (Gardner and Gibbs 2020)). This high rate of new species discovery and taxonomic changes will continue in bee genera and subgenera that either lack revisions or have not been revised in the last 50 years (e.g., Melissodes, Nomada, Sphecodes, many Andrena, etc.), particularly since prior taxonomic research on those groups predates molecular tools and high-resolution images.

Diagnosis. Both sexes of Augochloropsis humeralis can be distinguished from 
Augochloropsis metallica and Augochloropsis viridula by multiple characters. The 
pronotal flange of Augochloropsis humeralis has the lateral edges approaching 90 degrees 
(Figs 14D, 16D) whereas, the lateral edges of the pronotal flange in Augochloropsis 
metallica and Augochloropsis viridula are obtuse (Figs 14E, F, 16E, F, note they do 
still have a distinct pronotal flange as well). In addition, the vertex of Augochloropsis 
humeralis rises distinctly above the ocelli (Figs 14A, 16A) whereas it does not rise above 
the ocelli in metallica and viridula (Figs 14B, C, 16B, C). Finally, the strongly tessellate 
and "silky" texture of Augochloropsis humeralis (Figs 14G, 16G) is distinct in comparison 
to Augochloropsis metallica and Augochloropsis viridula (Figs 14H, I, 16H, I).

AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge the work of many people for loaning specimens and especially for tracking down and photographing the various type specimens: we thank Joseph Monks (NHMUK) for providing pictures of the types of Augochloropsis viridula, Augochloropsis lucidula, and Augochloropsis fulgida, as well as for his work searching for the type of Augochloropsis sumptuosa; we thank Jason Weintraub (ANSP) for tracking down the types of Augochloropsis humeralis; we thank Lars Vilhelmsen, Sree Selvantharan, and Anders Illum of the Natural History Museum of Denmark for taking pictures of the type of Augochloropsis metallica; and we thank James Hogan (OUMNH) for tracking down the type of Augochloropsis cuprea and kindly taking pictures of it. We thank J. Ascher for discussions on taxonomic best practices, and we thank Jason Gibbs, Thomas Onuferko, Laurence Packer, and an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments that improved the manuscript.

Holotype: ♀ USA, Florida,St. John's Bluff, East Florida [NHMUK014024970]. Images examined by ZP and MA(Fig. 23Comments. We define Augochloropsis fulgida differently than previous workers because examination of the type specimen (Fig. 23) revealed that it does not match the species concept used for Augochloropsis metallica fulgida byMitchell (1960). Even thoughMitchell (1960)examined the type, it does not key out correctly in his key or match his description. As it stands, the type of Augochloropsis fulgida does not match any Augochloropsis species we are familiar with. The type female, from St. John's Bluff Florida(Fig. 18), is most similar to Augochloropsis anonyma in that it has erect dark hairs on the metasoma(Fig. 23C, D), but it differs in having a larger and more tessellate propodeal triangle(Fig. 23C) compared to the narrow and shining propodeal triangle in Augochloropsis anonyma(Fig. 17E), and the hair fringe on T2 of Augochloropsis fulgida appears to be slightly more prominent than in Augochloropsis anonyma.More work is needed to clarify this species as it is currently only known from the type and the male is unknown. However, we have not performed a dedicated search for more material that could match Augochloropsis fulgida. It is also a possibility that the type of Augochloropsis fulgida is mislabeled and not from Florida or even the United States. However, a more likely explanation is that any Augochloropsis fulgida material has been misidentified as Augochloropsis anonyma due to the presence of black pubescence on the metasoma.Augochloropsis (Paraugochloropsis) sumptuosa (Smith)Augochlora sumptuosa Smith, 1853: 82 ♀.
