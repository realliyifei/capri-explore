The importance of integrating reading and writing activities in ESL/EFL classes cannot be overstated, especially in Indonesia where low literacy levels and reading interest present a challenge for teachers. This study conducted a literature review of 120 articles and books over the last 10 years taken from ZLibrary and Google Scholar's free database to identify effective strategies for incorporating reading and writing activities into the classroom that can be applied in many contexts and countries, including Indonesia. It was found that exposing students to various English text structures through these activities can greatly enhance their writing skills. By examining this literature, the study identifies 6 effective strategies for integrating reading and writing activities in ESL/EFL classes, namely summarizing, paraphrasing, short story writing, comparing and contrasting, discovery learning, and project-based learning. Teachers can employ these strategies to interplay reading and writing activities, helping students develop critical thinking skills, vocabulary, and writing abilities. In conclusion, it is clear that integrating reading and writing activities in ESL/EFL classes can provide a comprehensive approach to teaching and nurture students' writing skills, even in countries with low literacy levels and limited reading interest like Indonesia. Future research should explore additional effective strategies for integrating these activities.Elsya : Journal of English Language Studies https://journal.unilak.ac.id/index.php/elsya 108 Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers learners to be successful in school, work, and personal lives, they must master writing skills (Graham, 2019). Teaching writing to students of English as a foreign language includes reinforcement, language development, learning style, and writing as a skill in its own right(Fleckenstein et al., 2016).Numerous studies have claimed that through reading, students will obtain background knowledge related to the topics they are going to write about(Kirin, 2010;Al-Mansour, 2014;Salehi, et al., 2015;Wu, et al., 2021). For inference generation, the ability to integrate information within or across texts using background knowledge to fill in information not explicitly stated is an essential component of language comprehension. It is an ability that is a unique predictor of reading comprehension across developmental stages(Barth et al., 2015). Hence, reading gives writers fresh ideas and inspiration to write, and good writers spend much time reading before they start writing. Students can acquire writing competence through large amounts of self-motivated reading; therefore, we may say that reading achievement will influence writing abilityBarth et al., 2015).Fitzgerald and Shanahan's (2000)research has established that reading and writing are based on similar brain processes and isomorphic information. However, the common variance among various reading and writing markers has not been proven to exceed 50%. This indicates the separability of reading and writing and suggests that specific features that differentiate the two have not been fully isolated.

## Introduction

Indonesia's low literacy levels and lack of reading interest have presented a challenge for educators seeking to improve students' writing abilities. According to the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) research report released by the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2019, Indonesia's literacy level is ranked among the lowest 10 of 70 countries. Furthermore, UNESCO reports that only 0.001 percent of Indonesian people show an interest in reading, making it challenging for students to develop their language skills, particularly in writing (Risman & Rozimela 2019;Marashi & Dadari, 2012).

The integration of reading and writing activities in ESL/EFL classes is a crucial step in enhancing students' writing skills, particularly in countries such as Indonesia with low literacy levels and limited reading interest. Literature reviews have shown that exposing students to various English text structures through these activities can significantly improve their writing skills (Budianto, et al., (2022). Teachers can use various effective strategies to promote the interplay of reading and writing activities, such as summarizing, paraphrasing, short story writing, comparing and contrasting, discovery learning, and project-based learning (Park, 2016).

The importance of reading and writing skills in English cannot be overstated, as they are essential skills for learners with various language backgrounds. Learning to read is a crucial objective of early education, and difficulties in learning to read can have serious adverse consequences (Hulme & Snowling, 2015). For Despite the challenges, Indonesian educators are making progress in improving their students' reading and writing abilities. The National Library of Indonesia conducted a study on the reading interest of Indonesian people in 2021 and found that the value of the reading level has continued to increase since 2016 (Kurniadi, 2022). By utilizing effective ESL/EFL classroom strategies, educators can continue to foster their students' interest in reading, which can subsequently enhance their writing skills.

Some studies have explored the effectiveness of specific strategies such as summarizing and paraphrasing in improving students' writing skills, there is a need for more comprehensive research that examines the impact of the interplay between reading and writing on students' writing abilities (Salehi, et al., 2015;Wu, et al., 2021;Hartshorne et al., 2019;Fleckenstein et al., 2016;Al-Nafisah, 2019;Marashi & Dadari, 2012;Hulme & Snowling, 2015;Graham, 2019;Majorano et al., 2021;Prittimaa et al., 2015). However, there are gaps in the current research on the relationship between reading and writing in ESL/EFL classes in Indonesia. Additionally, there is a lack of research on the relationship between reading and writing skills and students' language backgrounds, particularly in the Indonesian context. Further research is necessary to better understand how reading and writing can complement each other in these classes and to develop effective teaching strategies that take advantage of the potential synergy between the two skills. While Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to investigate the interplay between reading and writing in ESL/EFL classes in various contexts and to explore the effectiveness of different reading and writing activities in enhancing students' writing skills in Indonesia, particularly regarding their low literacy levels and limited reading interests. By investigating and identifying the most effective reading and writing activities, this study can provide valuable information for ESL/EFL teachers in Indonesia to improve their teaching methodologies and pedagogical practices.

Moreover, the study will provide insight into the factors that influence the effectiveness of the interplay between reading and writing, including cultural differences, age, and motivation. In conclusion, while the importance of reading and writing skills in English cannot be overstated, there are still gaps in the current research on the interplay between reading and writing in ESL/EFL classes in Indonesia. This study aims to address these gaps and provide insight into the effectiveness of various reading and writing activities in enhancing students' writing abilities. The findings of this study can guide ESL/EFL teachers in Indonesia in designing effective reading and writing activities that can improve students' writing skills and contribute to their academic success. Ultimately, this study can benefit students, teachers, and policymakers in Indonesia and other countries with similar challenges related to low literacy levels and limited reading interests. Reading comprehension has become a critically crucial academic skill (Barth et al., 2017) that has been a fundamental cognitive ability (Capodieci et al., 2020). Reading activities can indeed help students complete writing assignments. Yet, based on the condition of the Indonesian students learning foreign language, such as English, incorporating what we learned in reading activities to writing activities in the L1 classroom may not automatically successful as foreign language learner, the students' perception during reading and writing in the L1 setting could greatly influence their L2 skills (Kocaman & Aslan, 2018). Furthermore, the learning environment that has been defined differently in the educational institutions play a significant role in the student's development (Ahmed et al., 2018) that determines academic achievement and learning (Bakhshialiabad et al., 2015). In L1 settings, students make use of their verbal ability to develop their writing. Conversely, L2 learners do not use a fully developed second language system as the basis for decoding and encoding written language in their first language . Adult second language learners do bring with them their developed first-language literacy skills. Although, the problem is that second language learners do not simply apply their L1 literacy skills to a developing or developed second language system. Consequently, second language learners should know the linguistic system of L2 before they can fully use their L1 skills in the framework of the L2 (Ziafar, 2015). Therefore, in observing the L2 reading and writing relationship, we should also consider the role played by L1 literacy skills. ESL students come from various linguistic, cultural, and educational backgrounds that may have varying needs and would face different challenges. L2 learners should acquire the standards, conventions, lexicon, and rhetorical structures to succeed (Kanakri, 2018). Researchers propose three interrelated hypotheses about the relationship between reading and writing in an L1 setting . The first hypothesis assumes that reading and writing function in one direction (i.e., directional) relationship. Reading and writing share structural components such that whatever is acquired in reading can be applied in writing. For example, if a learner reads a causeand-effect text, he will write new text following the pattern. The second hypothesis assumes that reading and writing skills do not correlate directionally. Those skills come from the same fundamental proficiency. The only common relation is that of the cognitive process of constructing meaning. In addition, the nondirectional theory also stresses the idea of what is transferred to writing and what is acquired in writing will be transferred to reading. The third hypothesis assumes that the two skills relationship is bi-directional. Those skills are not only interactive but also interdependent.  says that what students learn at one stage of development can be different from what is learned at another stage of development, arguing that "studies of reading -writing relationship need to consider it as a constellation of interrelated processes that utilized several knowledge bases" (p.92).

In conclusion, the transmission of literacy skills from the L1 and L2 has a prominent role in the readingwriting relationship in cognitive processes and structural components. Knowing that the L2 reading and writing relationship influences literacy transfer, teaching L2 reading and writing should facilitate the transfer. Teachers should use students' L1 reading and writing skills to promote L2 literacy, so that L2 learners will be prepared to utilize that relationship in their reading and writing and become proficient second language writers . As teachers, especially in the country like Indonesia, they have to consider multiple relationships in reading and writing. Multiple connections and interrelated processes will help teachers choose appropriate activities to suit the structural and cognitive similarities in reading and writing.


## Empirical Studies on Reading and Writing Interplay

Reading and writing are interdependent skills that support students' learning and academic success. The cognitive process of constructing meaning is a common factor between reading and writing (Ferris & Hedgcock, 1998). By incorporating writing activities into reading comprehension, students engage in a more complex cognitive process such as inferring, synthesis, and analysis (Noor, 2021). Good readers tend to be good writers, and better readers produce more syntactically mature writing than poorer readers . Reading provides writers with ideas, data, model sentence patterns, and structures, and it can motivate students to find further reading resources (Grabe & Kaplan, 1996).

Empirical studies have demonstrated the correlation between reading and writing skills in both L1 and L2 settings. For example, students who engaged in extensive pleasure reading produced superior writing samples compared to those who practiced traditional essay writing (De Vries, cited in Ferris & Hedgcock, 1998). In ESL/EFL settings, foreign students' writing proficiency significantly correlates with the amount Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers of pleasure reading they do in English (Ferris & Hedgcock, 1998). However, previous studies have only examined the relationship between reading and writing skills at a general level and focused on reading and writing assessments separately (Carrell & Connor, 1991).

Therefore, it is important to investigate the interplay between reading and writing skills in a more comprehensive and integrated manner. This can provide valuable insights for ESL/EFL teachers to design effective reading and writing activities that can enhance students' writing abilities and improve their academic success.

Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers


## 6 Effective Strategies

The integration of reading and writing activities in the ESL/EFL classroom is essential for improving students' language proficiency, writing skills, and critical thinking abilities (Brinton, Snow, & Wesche, 1989;Keck, 2014). The following effective 6 strategies have been identified in the literature for implementing this integration in many places or country such as Indonesian context: 1) Summarizing: A strategy that has been shown to be effective in promoting comprehension, vocabulary development, and writing skills among ESL/EFL learners Summarizing is a strategy that has been shown to be effective in promoting comprehension, vocabulary development, and writing skills among ESL/EFL learners (Brinton, Snow, & Wesche, 1989;Keck, 2014). Teachers can use this strategy by providing students with a reading passage and asking them to summarize it in one or two sentences. This activity can help students identify the main idea, distinguish between important and less important details, and develop their paraphrasing skills 2) Paraphrasing: Another strategy that has been shown to be effective in promoting comprehension and writing skills among ESL/EFL learners (Burt & Kiparsky, 1972;Lim et al., 2022). 3) Short story writing: Aeffective strategy for developing students' writing skills, creativity, and critical thinking abilities (Flowerdew, 2000;Hyland, 2003). Teachers can provide students with a prompt or a theme and ask them to write a short story based on that prompt or theme. This activity can help students generate ideas, organize their thoughts, and practice their writing skills. 4) Comparing and contrasting: a strategy that has been shown to be effective in promoting critical thinking and writing skills among ESL/EFL learners Samway & Taylor, 2007). Teachers can ask students to compare and contrast two texts or two stories they have read in class. This activity can help students identify similarities and differences, develop their writing skills, and enhance their critical thinking abilities. 5) Discovery learning: an effective strategy for promoting critical thinking, creativity, and writing skills among ESL/EFL learners (Castronova, 2002;Senoo & Yonemoto, 2014).Teachers can provide students with a prompt or a theme and ask them to explore and discover new concepts and ideas related to that prompt or theme. This activity can help students generate ideas, enhance their research skills, and practice their writing skills. 6) Project-based learning: a strategy that has been shown to be effective in promoting critical thinking, research skills, and writing skills among ESL/EFL learners (Alsamani & Daif-Allah 2016;Rodríguez-Peñarroja, 2022;Aghayani & Hajmohammadi, 2019). Teachers can assign a project that requires students to read, research, and write about a specific topic, such as a cultural event or a historical figure. This activity can help students enhance their research skills, develop their writing skills, and practice their critical thinking abilities.

These 6 effective strategies for integrating reading and writing activities in the ESL/EFL classroom in Indonesia have been shown to promote language proficiency, critical thinking abilities, and writing skills among learners (Brinton, Snow, & Wesche, 1989;Keck, 2014;Burt & Kiparsky, 1972;Rooney, K. (2000);Flowerdew, 2000;Hyland, 2003;Samway & Taylor, 2007& Taylor, 2007Castronova, 2002;Senoo & Yonemoto, 2014;Rodríguez-Peñarroja, 2022;Aghayani & Hajmohammadi, 2019). These strategies can be adapted and applied to different teaching contexts and are valuable for ESL/EFL teachers in many places including country like Indonesia.


## The Interplay Between Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL Classroom

The teaching of foreign languages, especially English, in Indonesia has adopted the approach of mutual reinforcement between reading and writing. ESL/EFL teachers integrate them into their curricula to develop and improve writing skills, as well as increase reading proficiency. Although the interplay between reading and writing may take different forms in the actual teaching world,  proposes implications for the integration of reading and writing in teaching situations. ESL/EFL teachers should teach their students strategies and skills to read the text, techniques for taking notes, and skills and strategies to plan for writing (Ferris & Hedgcock, 1998).

To apply the implications in real situations, ESL/EFL teachers can address their lessons through three different steps. The first step, known as "pre-reading" activities, aims to activate students' background knowledge and stimulate their interest in the topic of the reading text (Hoel et al., 2020). The second step, known as "while-reading," allows students to interact with the author through the reading text, where they Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers can take notes or summarize essential points in the text. The third step, called "post-reading" activities, will allow students to see the links between writing and reading . Grabe and Stoller (2001) propose that reading and writing skills are commonly integrated into the teaching and learning process in academic settings. They suggest writing activities that can be developed from reading sources, such as writing journals about the information students read and creating graphic organizers to identify main ideas of a text. These activities can bridge the gap between practical writing and reading in academic settings.

Despite the benefits of integrating reading and writing, realizing the connection between them in teaching can be challenging for teachers. To create a variety of writing activities through reading, the teacher can give students some instruction about the activities they will perform after they read the text, which gives purpose to reading and helps students concentrate on the reading (Wilth et al., 2019). The coordination of language mastery is a complicated and multidimensional concept (Bigozzi et al., 2017) that needs to be considered.


## Discussion

This section aims to discuss the interplay between reading and writing activities in the ESL/EFL classroom in Indonesia. The importance of integrating reading and writing activities in language learning cannot be overstated, as they mutually reinforce and enhance language proficiency. The main objectives of this literature review is to identify the most effective strategies for interplaying reading and writing activities in the ESL/EFL classroom in Indonesia. To answer this question, the study used a natural qualitative approach of library research and the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) known as NVivo to manage data analysis and synthesis. Based on the analysis of the literature, six effective strategies have been identified, including summarizing, paraphrasing, using graphic organizers, and providing feedback on writing. These strategies have been found to not only enhance language skills but also increase students' motivation and engagement in the learning process. These recommendations are crucial in the Indonesian ESL/EFL classroom context, where teachers face challenges in balancing students' English skills and fostering their interest in reading and writing. By implementing these strategies, teachers can promote a more interactive and effective learning environment that will benefit their students' language development and success.


### Summarizing the Issue in the Text

Summarizing is a proven strategy that can help students develop both their reading comprehension and writing skills (Mokhtari & Reichard, 2002). In addition to condensing information and identifying main ideas, summarizing provides an opportunity for students to practice paraphrasing, expand their vocabulary, and improve their writing fluency. Teachers can incorporate summarizing activities by asking students to summarize news articles or textbook chapters, or to summarize stories they have read in class. However, it is important for teachers to consider the language proficiency level of their students, as summarizing may be more beneficial for intermediate and advanced learners (Khoshsima & Rezaeian 2014;Chiu, 2015).

Reading activities can also be used as pre-writing exercises to test students' reading comprehension and develop their writing skills. Students can carry out activities to rewrite the contents of the text they have read in their own words, which helps them reconstruct meaning in the written form. Teachers can also ask students to summarize the issue in the text after they read it, providing guidelines to ensure a good summary. The type of reading text used will depend on the students' proficiency level, with summaries helping them focus on major details supporting the main idea. These activities will help students train to focus on important information they read in text to be used later in their writing. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of integrating reading and writing activities to improve ESL/EFL students' language skills (Grabe & Stoller, 2001;Ferris & Hedgcock, 1998). Effective strategies such as summarizing and reading activities as pre-writing exercises can enhance the interplay between reading and writing, and lead to more engaging and effective learning environments. Teachers should be aware of the language proficiency level of their students and provide appropriate guidance and feedback to ensure successful implementation of these strategies.

Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers


## Paraphrasing Short Texts

Several studies have shown the effectiveness of paraphrasing as a strategy for improving reading and writing skills in the ESL/EFL classroom. For example, Khoshsima & Rezaeian 2014(2011 found that paraphrasing activities helped students to better understand the main ideas and supporting details of a text, and to use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures in their writing. Similarly, (Choy & Lee, 2012). found that paraphrasing activities helped students to improve their comprehension and writing skills, and to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the content of the texts they read.

Paraphrasing is a useful skill that can help students improve both their reading and writing abilities in the ESL/EFL classroom. Paraphrasing involves restating a text in one's own words, while retaining the original meaning and intention of the text (Choy & Lee, 2012). It is a valuable technique for developing reading comprehension skills, as students must identify and understand the key ideas and supporting details of the text in order to rephrase them in their own words. Paraphrasing also enhances students' writing skills, as they must use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures to convey the meaning of the original text (Na & Nhat, 2017;Flores & Lopez, 2019;Yahia & Egbert, 2023).

One effective way for teachers to incorporate paraphrasing into their ESL/EFL lessons is to provide short reading texts for students to practice with. These texts can be selected based on the students' proficiency level, and can range from simple news articles to more complex academic papers (Hirvela & Du, 2013;Chen, et al., 2015;Ruslan, et al., 2020). Students can then be asked to paraphrase the text in their own words, using appropriate vocabulary and grammar. This activity can help students develop their ability to identify the main idea and important supporting sentences in each paragraph of the text, which is essential for effective paraphrasing.

After several short text practices, the teacher can gradually increase the length and complexity of the reading texts to be paraphrased. This allows students to gradually build their skills and confidence in paraphrasing longer and more complex texts. Additionally, this activity helps students to expand their vocabulary and improve their writing style, as they must use appropriate synonyms and sentence structures to rephrase the original text (Escudero, et al., 2019;Hagaman & Reid, 2008).

Paraphrasing short texts is an effective strategy for improving both reading and writing skills in the ESL/EFL classroom. This activity provides students with the opportunity to practice their reading comprehension and writing skills in a structured and supportive environment. By gradually increasing the complexity of the texts to be paraphrased, students can build their skills and confidence in this important technique, and become more proficient readers and writers (Hagaman & Reid, 2008;Hirvela & Du, 2013;Chen, et al., 2015;Escudero, et al., 2019;Ruslan, et al., 2020).


## Short Story Writing

Short story writing is an effective way to integrate reading and writing activities in the ESL/EFL classroom Khatib & Nourzadeh, 2011;Nozen, et al., 2017). The reading materials used for this activity should be selected based on the type of text the teacher wishes to practice in class (Pourkalhor & Kohan, 2013;Yilmaz, 2015). After the students have read the entire text, they can identify some aspects found in the text and use those as inspiration for their own short story. To ensure that students are able to express their ideas freely, writing activities should be based on their interests (Khatib & Nasrollahi, 2012;Kirkgöz, 2012;Yilmaz, 2015;Huang, 2019). The teacher can encourage the students to find and read more sources related to their idea to support their story before writing it down. This activity can help students to develop their research skills and improve their ability to support their arguments with evidence.

The ultimate goal of writing a short story is to train students to demonstrate their understanding of the content of the text they have read (Baleghizadeh & Babapour, 2011). Teachers can guide students in developing their writing skills by providing them with prompts and feedback on their work. By using short story writing as an activity in the ESL/EFL classroom, teachers can create a more engaging and effective learning environment for their students. Moreover, the use of short stories in the ESL/EFL classroom has been a debated topic among educators. While some argue that short stories can be effective in improving students' reading comprehension and writing skills, others believe that they may not be suitable for all learners, particularly those with lower proficiency levels (Cameron, 2001). However, when used appropriately, short story writing can be an engaging and effective way for students to improve their writing abilities and demonstrate their understanding of the text. it is important to note that short story writing may Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers not be suitable for all students, particularly those with lower proficiency levels. Some studies have suggested that students with limited vocabulary or writing skills may struggle to write a cohesive story that accurately reflects their understanding of the text (Cameron, 2001). In these cases, teachers may need to provide additional support, such as sentence starters or prompts, to help students get started.

In conclusion, short story writing can be an effective way to improve students' reading comprehension and writing skills in the ESL/EFL classroom, provided that it is used appropriately and tailored to the students' proficiency level. By carefully selecting reading materials, providing guidance and feedback, and encouraging creativity, teachers can help their students to develop their writing skills and demonstrate their understanding of the text.


## Comparing and Contrasting

One effective way to incorporate this approach in the ESL/EFL classroom is to ask students to compare and contrast the issue in the reading texts. This activity can help students develop critical thinking and analytical skills, as well as improve their writing ability.

To carry out this activity, teachers can select multiple sources related to a topic and provide them to students for reading. For example, if the topic is about environmental pollution, students can be given a news article, a scientific report, and a personal essay about someone's experience with pollution. By reading these different sources, students can compare and contrast the ideas presented in each text. They can identify similarities and differences, and then synthesize the information into a cohesive and coherent piece of writing. One study by Hammann & Stevens (2003). found that comparing and contrasting is an effective strategy for improving students' writing ability in the ESL/EFL classroom. In their study, EFL students were asked to write a compare and contrast essay about two short stories. The results showed that students who received explicit instruction in compare and contrast writing produced significantly better essays than those who did not receive such instruction.

According to (Claudio, 2005;Farneste, 2012;Mustika & Adnan, 2019) comparing and contrasting is a valuable writing strategy for developing critical thinking skills in language learners. Through this technique, students learn to identify and analyze the key features of different objects, concepts, or ideas, and to understand how they are related. Comparing and contrasting can also help students to develop their writing skills, as they must use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures to convey the similarities and differences. Furthermore, reading multiple sources can benefit students in comparing and contrasting the ideas. Reading multiple sources helps learners to understand different perspectives and to develop a critical analysis of the information. After gathering enough information about the similarities and the differences, students need to organize the information in a coherent and cohesive way for readers to understand the writing. This process requires students to use appropriate transitions and other writing conventions to ensure their writing is clear and effective.

Another study by Toba & Noor (2019). examined the effects of compare and contrast instruction on the writing skills of Indonesian EFL students. The study found that explicit instruction in compare and contrast writing led to significant improvement in students' writing ability and critical thinking skills. Similar, result also highlighted in the study by Sadeghi, Biniaz, & Soleimani (2016), comparing and contrasting can help students to develop their writing skills and enhance their critical thinking abilities. In their study, the authors found that the use of comparing and contrasting activities led to an improvement in students' writing quality and a higher level of critical thinking. Similarly, another study by Farneste, (2012) as well as Mustika & Adnan, (2019) showed that comparing and contrasting could be an effective way to improve students' writing skills and their ability to analyze texts.

The technique of comparing and contrasting can be applied to a range of texts, including short stories, news articles, and academic papers. For example, in a literature class, teachers can ask students to compare and contrast the themes, characters, and settings of two different short stories. This activity can help students to develop their analytical skills and to understand how different literary elements contribute to the overall meaning of a text.

It is important to note that the effectiveness of the technique of comparing and contrasting may depend on the level of language proficiency of the students. Some studies have suggested that comparing and contrasting may be more beneficial for intermediate and advanced learners, as these students may have a better understanding of the structure of written texts and are able to identify key information more easily Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers (Khoshsima & Rezaeian 2014;Chiu, 2015). Therefore, teachers should take into account the language proficiency level of their students when planning and implementing comparing and contrasting activities. Furthermore, teachers should select reading materials based on students' proficiency level and interests. This can help increase student engagement and motivation. As suggested by Craig (2012). Teachers can encourage students to find texts related to their interests and use them as a basis for their writing.

In conclusion, the activity of comparing and contrasting is an effective strategy for integrating reading and writing activities in the ESL/EFL classroom. It can help students develop critical thinking and analytical skills, as well as improve their writing ability. By providing appropriate guidance and support, teachers can help students fully understand the concepts and skills involved, and create a more engaging and effective learning environment.


## Discovery Learning

Incorporating discovery learning in the ESL/EFL classroom is an effective way of integrating reading and writing skills. Discovery learning involves students reading various texts related to the curriculum to gather information, which is then compared, analyzed, integrated, and reorganized to draw conclusions based on questions posed by the teacher (Schwartz et al., 2016). This process allows students to engage in critical thinking, reading comprehension, and writing skills. Through this activity, students are able to identify the main ideas and supporting details of the texts, and develop their ability to synthesize information and express their ideas effectively in writing.

The process of discovery learning involves the use of various types of paragraphs, including explanation paragraphs and cause-and-effect paragraphs, depending on the content of the materials being read (Heafner et al., 2017). In an explanation paragraph, students explain the information they have discovered in their own words, while in a cause-and-effect paragraph, students describe the relationship between the different pieces of information they have gathered. By engaging in these types of writing activities, students develop their writing skills by using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas effectively.

Additionally, discovery learning provides a valuable opportunity for students to practice their research skills, as they must find and read various texts related to the topic being studied (Singaravelu, 2012;Yanto & Nugraha, 2017;Sofeny, 2017;Ayende & Bleza, 2021). This process of searching and analyzing different sources improves students' ability to navigate through different types of texts and extract relevant information, which is a key skill in both reading and writing. Moreover, discovery learning provides an engaging and interactive approach to learning that promotes student motivation and interest. According to (Sofeny, 2017;Ayende & Bleza, 2021), discovery learning activities provide students with a sense of ownership and responsibility in their learning, which can improve their motivation and engagement in the classroom.

Moreover, the strategy of discovery learning is an effective approach to integrating reading and writing skills in the ESL/EFL classroom. According to Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006), the use of discovery learning as a teaching strategy allows students to engage in higher-order thinking processes, such as analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information. Through this approach, students are asked to read literature and collect information related to the learning materials in the curriculum. The collected information is then compared, categorized, analyzed, integrated, and reorganized in order to draw conclusions based on questions posed by the teacher. As students engage in this process, they are required to write one or two paragraphs to display the data and information they discover when they read the literature.

Discovery learning can be used to develop a range of writing skills, such as explanation paragraphs or cause and effect paragraphs, depending on the content of the materials students read. This strategy not only develops writing skills but also enhances students' reading comprehension abilities, as they must read the literature and identify key information to integrate into their writing. Additionally, this approach encourages students to become active learners, developing their research and analytical skills, as well as their writing abilities (Dochy, Segers, Van den Bossche, & Gijbels, 2003).

It is important for teachers to ensure that the literature chosen for discovery learning is appropriate for the level of their students. The literature should be relevant to the learning materials in the curriculum and should provide challenging but achievable reading material for the students (Staal, 2000;Sofeny, 2017;Ayende & Bleza, 2021). Moreover, teachers should provide guidance and support to their students as they Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers engage in this process, providing appropriate feedback and scaffolding to ensure that they understand the concepts and skills involved in the writing process.

In conclusion, integrating discovery learning into the ESL/EFL classroom is an effective strategy for combining reading and writing skills, developing critical thinking and research skills, and enhancing student motivation and engagement. Teachers should choose appropriate literature, provide guidance, and incorporate discovery learning activities to create a more engaging and effective learning environment.


## Project Based Learning

Project-based learning allows students to build their knowledge on a topic of interest and demonstrate it through a project. Prior to the completion of the project, students are required to read various sources, such as magazines, newspapers, research articles, manuals, and textbooks, in order to gain sufficient knowledge to undertake the project (Syarifah & Emiliasari, 2019;Nguyen, 2011;Lu, 2021). Moreover, Project-based learning provides an effective approach for students to improve their writing skills. Through this approach, students can build their knowledge and writing skills by engaging in various steps of the project. According to Argawati, & Suryani (2020),Nguyen,(2011, project-based learning provides students with the opportunity to engage in critical thiking, communication, collaboration, and creativity, which are essential skills for effective writing. Project-based learning also promotes motivation and engagement, as students are given the opportunity to explore and apply their knowledge in a meaningful and interesting way.

Project-based learning provides a context for students to build their content knowledge and apply it to a practical task. In order to complete the project, students must read and analyze a variety of sources, including magazines, newspapers, manuals, research articles, and textbooks, in order to gain the necessary knowledge to complete the project. This process of reading, exploring, interpreting, and synthesizing information is essential for developing students' reading and writing abilities (Sofeny,2017).

The activities listed in this section are only a small part of the innovations that teachers can use to improve the writing quality of ESL/EFL students. Integrating reading and writing interchangeably during lessons is a valuable technique for enhancing students' writing skills. According to Sirisrimangkorn, L. (2021); Allison, & Do (2015); Kemaloglu-Er & Sahin, (2022) integrating reading and writing in the ESL/EFL classroom helps students to develop their writing skills by exposing them to different types of texts and allowing them to practice different types of writing. It also enhances their reading comprehension skills, as they must understand the text, they read in order to write effectively. In addition, other strategies, such as peer review, feedback, and journal writing, can be used to improve the writing quality of ESL/EFL students. Peer review allows students to exchange feedback on each other's writing, providing an opportunity to receive feedback and practice editing skills (Cho & Schunn, 2007). Feedback, when provided by teachers or peers, helps students to understand their writing strengths and weaknesses, providing an opportunity to make improvements (Choy & Lee, 2012). Journal writing is also a valuable strategy for ESL/EFL students, as it provides a safe and low-stakes environment for students to practice writing and reflect on their learning (Mair, 2012).

In conclusion, project-based learning is a valuable approach for improving the writing skills of ESL/EFL students. By engaging in various steps of a project, students can build their knowledge and writing skills in a meaningful and interesting way. Additionally, integrating reading and writing interchangeably during lessons, as well as other strategies such as peer review, feedback, and journal writing, are valuable techniques for enhancing students' writing skills. Teachers should use a combination of these approaches to ensure that students receive a well-rounded and engaging writing curriculum.


## Conclusion

The interplay between reading and writing in the ESL/EFL field has been studied in many research for improving the students' writing skills. Cultivating a good reading habit helps to improve the competency in composing a fluent, meaningful, and grammatically correct text. Since reading and writing share some cognitive similarities, for example, they are active and recursive processes. Hence, it is appropriate for the ESL/EFL teachers to utilize them into more teaching strategies to answer the gap of students' writing quality due to their lack of interest in reading. Moreover, the interplay between reading and writing activities has been proven to be an effective strategy for improving the writing skills of ESL/EFL students. Reading and writing are active and recursive processes that share cognitive similarities, making them appropriate for ESL/EFL teachers to utilize in various teaching strategies. Research studies have shown that integrating Interplaying Reading and Writing in ESL/EFL: A Literature Review of Strategies for Indonesian Teachers reading and writing activities into ESL/EFL lessons helps to bridge the gap in students' writing quality caused by their lack of interest in reading and practice in writing, as well as their unfamiliarity with various text structures. This study also highlights 6 most effective strategies-based review in this study such as paraphrasing, summarizing, writing short stories, and comparing and contrasting, are effective strategies for cultivating reading and writing skills simultaneously. It is hoped that these studies will guide other researchers to discover more innovative strategies to integrate reading and writing, as well as other skills, to improve the achievement of ESL/EFL students in their lessons.
