Trends in the design of microcircuits for front-end electronics (overview)

The results of literature analysis devoted to the design of multichannel microcircuits for data acquisition and signal processing from radiation detectors in large physical experiments have been presented. Such parameters of microcircuits as the number of signal processing channels, power consumption per channel, noise level, input charge conversion factor (for the linear part of channel) and so on are considered. We also touched upon the technology of manufacture and the name of physical experiment in the framework of which the design was carried out.

The aim of the paper is to reveal the existing trends in the implementation of microelectronic units, collecting and processing the signals from radiation detectors in large-scale physical experiments. The comparison of present-day microelectronic products is carried out by their most important parameters, particularly: channel number (Nch), power consumption per channel (Pcon), input noise charge (Qn) and conversion factor (Kcon). The technology of manufacture is also taken into account.

In our report the parameters of several tens of ICs, presented in scientific papers and conference materials of the last several years were adduced. The summarizing table, given below, contains the data on 26 selected ICs, each having at least 16 channels. We acknowledge, that the IC comparison by some of the parameters is rather conventional. First of all that refers to P con -power consumption per channel, since those channels may differ significantly in their structure and complexity: in some cases a channel consists of only a sequence of analog units, while in other ones an ADC and digital processing units are added.

After analyzing the data of the above presented table one can make the following inferences:

 Typical values of the basic parameters of present-day FEE ICs are as follows:

Pcon -units of mW per channel, Qn -hundreds of electrons, Kcon -tens of mV/fC.  The FEE ICs are most often found with the following numbers of channels: 16, 32, 64 and 128. Present-day technologies allow the manufacturer to create ICs with a greater number of channels, but, from the practical point of view (considering particularly the placement of ICs on a PCB whereon the IC inputs should be connected to the detector outputs), those greater numbers may not appear expedient.  Among the possible technologies the FEE ASIC designers prefer the one of CMOS, which allows them to solve the problems of minimizing power consumption, cost and chip area in a much simpler way.  If quite recently the FEE equipment contained only analog electronics, nowadays a distinct trend to include in it some digital processing units is well observed.  Radiation hardness, that till recently was often demanded for space-intended equipment, is nowadays more and more requested for stationary equipment, especially when the latter is placed near the "beam zone" of accelerator.  The main way of improving the electrical and mass-dimensional characteristics of FEE units is their implementation in the form of multichannel ASICs.
