Women empowerment has been considered as a major challenge to meet the prime objective of economic development in most underdeveloped countries of the world. Various initiatives have been taken at both policy and program levels by both government and civil society organizations to improve the status of women. In the recent past, microcredit schemes have been the dominant tool to improve women; socioeconomic status. This study, therefore, aims to examine the impact of microcredit on women's empowerment. Data is collected through Primary source using questionnaire survey research approach. A sample of hundred and fifty female respondents was taken from Quetta city involved in home made goods. Cross tabulation analysis was used to show whether there is a difference in opinion responses and chi-square test analysis was applied to examine the association between microcredit and women's empowerment as measured by decision-making at the household level. The results of this study found that the microcredit program has a significant positive association with women's empowerment. The study further shows that microcredit improves women's access to household level assets. Thus, this paper concludes that empowered women through micro-credit scheme are successful in attaining employment, improvement in social status, owning of assets and contribute to the economy.

## Introduction

Empowerment refers to the enlargement of the assets of the capabilities of the community to control, influence and hold accountable institutions that affect their lives (World Bank resource Book, 2015). Empowerment can be taken as a source of forming a social environment in which an individual makes decisions and make alternative choices, either individual or collectively for successful and stable social transformation (Batwala, 1994). Women accounts for 48.63% of the entire population of Pakistan (World Bank, 2014). This is almost half of the current 20 crores general population of the country. Apart from a minimal percentage of those who have settled in urban parts of the country, the life of the majority of Pakistani women is unfortunately characterized by deprivation, vulnerability, lower social status and at least developed segment of the population as compared to her male counterparts.

One obvious reason behind all sufferings of the female gender is embedded in our cultural practices. The grouping expectation for being a powerful force of our immaterial aspect of culture restricts women's role, mobility, and socioeconomic interventions. Women are least expected to come forward and contribute to efforts designed to achieve national goals and objectives at the national level. She has leased access to all available opportunities and social services which are required for her grown up and personality development. Consequently, she does not avail level playing field to compete with her male counterpart. This cultural impediment gets further harsh when it is supported by religious and tribal bigwigs. Indeed, this is the outcome of above mentioned biased treatment that a wide gap is vividly evident between both the genders in all fields of life, which leads towards an ever increasing deteriorating social status of women across provinces of the country. After years of repeated efforts by both academicians and practitioners it was somewhat learned that for bringing about any positive change in the life of women, their economic status must be addressed altogether. It is argued that since women, due to various socio-cultural hurdles, is unable to contribute into economic affairs of her family; therefore, she is faced with a lower social status that guides all other spheres of her life. The 30-70 percent division of population as producers and consumers of resources is one of the major characteristics of the citizenry in Pakistan. The largest portion i.e. 70% has lost or no contribution into income generation of the family. This 70% includes women and dependent underage children. They are believed to be just consuming the resources being produced by 30% producers. And for being consumers of resources, women are, by and large, fully dependent on her male counterparts for each and everything, which restricts her efforts to change the current none-friendly environment.

To help women become change agents of her own fate, she has been focused on programs and projects of micro financing / micro credit loans by both Non-Governmental Organizations NGOs and public sector organizations during the past three decades. The micro-financing schemes apart from lending a minimal amount of cash have been mobilizing women to get empowered and contribute to the wellbeing of her family and society. In developing societies where women resisted against oppressive economic and social environments, micro financing has proven to be a very significant stimulating force to empower them on a sustainable basis. Without women's participation in the socioeconomic process economic growth and sustainable democracy cannot be attained. Therefore, this research paper is small preliminary efforts in this regard. Primary data analyzed to highlight the socioeconomic impact of micro-credit loans towards efforts pertaining to women empowerment.


## Literature Review

Microcredit schemes have been widely acknowledged as an instrumental force for poverty alleviation and improving women's socioeconomic empowerment. It benefits the vulnerable communities generate household income and enable them to make decisions which affect their social environment (Samer et al., 2015).

Similarly, Study conducted by (Ghaliba, Malki, and Imai 2014), highlights that Pakistani microcredit schemes have a significant effect on women's empowerment and also poverty alleviation which was exhibited in household income generation and expenditure mainly in clothing and health related issues. Microcredit scheme, in general, is the expansion of a few loans to a relatively vulnerable group of the society for their self -employment and income -generation (Rehman, 1999). Various existing literate from Africa found that women are empowered mainly due to access to credit and some have observed as limited control over the use of microcredit loans and are not empowered in particular settings (Ganel,et al.,2015).

However, studies conducted in South Asia recommended that Grameen Bank's micro-credit loan program in Bangladesh is positively associated with the level of women's empowerment (Hashemi et al., 1996;Sinha, 1998). The application of Microcredit scheme splinted the political scale, since, it pools the values of both social capital and the Market economy as characterized by hard work, selfsupport, free markets, access to market inputs and also expanding the economic conditions of the poor. The empirical evidence depicted that by giving small loans to women involved in financial management practices, the beneficiary, the clients may develop their enterprise performance and also leads to household welfare (Elizabeth et al., 2001).

Other existing literature established that that loans generated by women are commonly controlled by their partner which results in women's dependence on their husbands for loan installments and may also contribute to domestic dissension and violence (Goetz and Gupta, 1996;Leach andSitaram, 2002 andA. Rahman, 1999). However, the study conducted by Ghalib, Malik, and Katsushi (2012) established that there were statistically significant differences between microfinance groups regarding changes in household expenditure on purchasing of daily needs such as washing machine, clothing and etc. While centering on the more civil society networks such as NGOs, banks and MFIs, have successfully empowered to access to basic needs of life and also improves borrower's quality of life and poverty reduction (Al-mamun et al. 2014).

In any case, the instance of Balochistan is somewhat stunning, where the neediness rate is much higher than different areas. Balochistan is the slightest created and mostly in the reverse territory, which gets nearly less consideration of the central government for its financial improvement, in this way mass neediness, wins here with a quickening pace.
