Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) discovered and studies the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined phase of nuclear matter

• QGP existed in the early universe • Little is known about properties of nuclear matter • RHIC uniquely able to explore phase diagram of nuclear matter  STAR, arXiv:1007.2613 3 At ~1 fm/c after a heavy-ion collision, excited nuclear systems with some local equilibrium are formed somewhere in the "phase diagram." R CP is seen as a measure of the parton energy loss in the medium.

• Suppression at high p T indicative of QGP formation.

No suppression of R CP is seen below ~39 GeV.

The p T reach at lower energies is limited by statistics. • Pion R CP is suppressed at ~27 GeV.
R CP = 〈N bin peri 〉 d 3 N AA cen dηd 2 p T 〈N bin cen 〉 d 3 N AA peri dηd 2 p T
• Proton R CP is not suppressed.

• The p T reach at lower energies is limited by statistics. n Q scaling is seen as a possible indicator of partonic behavior.

n Q scaling holds for particles to within ~10%.

The φ meson may not follow the trends at 11.5 or 7.7 GeV. More data needed. As beam energy decreases, difference between particle and antiparticle v 2 increases. Turn-off of QGP signatures: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) 11 CME is phenomenon where separation of charges occurs from large magnetic fields in non-central collisions. It would require the system to be deconfined.


## Charges separately

Signal-Background γ may be sensitive to CME.

Effect goes away at low beam energy. 


GeV, particle and antiparticle v 2 agree well.


First-order phase transition: <m T > <m T > is related to the temperature of the system.The saturation of <m T > is indicative of a 1 st order phase transition region. E T includes mass and is associated with the energy density.E. O'Brien, [PHENIX Collaboration], Nucl. Phys. A 904, 905, (2013) 264cFirst-order phase transition: azimuthal HBTarXiv:1404.1433,

Goals of BES are to locate: 

Turn-off of QGP

First-order phase

Critical Point

A 1 st order phase transition would 
be characterized by a region with 
the lowest compressibility. 

The v 1 would show early pressure of 
system. Softest point?

Pion azimuthal 
HBT allows the 
study of the 
coordinate 
space "almond 
shape" (ε F ) after 
expansion 

No minimum 
observed. 

Dip, such as at 
the CERES 
point, would be 
indicative of 
phase transition.
