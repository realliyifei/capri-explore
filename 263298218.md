Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in newborns: experience at a pediatric hospital and a literature review
191BBD72CB5B8EBB042A65824D7106C210.1016/j.rpth.2023.102214Received: 25 May 2023 -Revised: 8 August 2023 -Accepted: 16 September 2023childheparinheparin-induced thrombocytopeniaincidencenewbornsthrombocytopeniathrombosis
Background: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare, difficult-to-diagnose, and potentially serious adverse drug reaction with thrombotic complications.Even though the immune system is still immature during the neonatal period, HIT has been described in newborns with reporting rates ranging from 0% to 2.3%.Therefore, it is important to clarify the risk of HIT in newborns because it can affect the management and monitoring of heparin treatment.Objectives:The objectives of the present study were to review the literature and determine the incidence of HIT after cardiac surgery in newborns in our pediatric hospital.Methods:We searched the literature from 1992 to 2021 for reports of HIT in newborns.Four raters then analyzed all the literature reports on HIT and classified them as "likely," "uncertain," or "unlikely."We also determined the incidence of HIT among newborns having undergone cardiac surgery in our pediatric hospital.Results: Eleven population-based studies and 12 case reports on suspected HIT in 17 newborns were reviewed.One study reported HIT in 14 out of 930 (1.5%) heparintreated newborns, but the other studies (n = 467 newborns) did not mention HIT at all.None of the cases described in the literature was classified as "likely" by the raters.In our center, none of the 2997 newborns that had undergone cardiac surgery in the previous 16 years was diagnosed with HIT.Conclusion:We conclude that the incidence of HIT in newborns has been overestimated in the literature.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare, adverse drug reaction characterized by its potential thrombosis-related seriousness.HIT is an immunologic disorder induced by the production of immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies against platelet factor 4-heparin complex (PF4/H).Platelet activation induced by PF4/H/IgG complexes, combined with the activation of endothelial cells, monocytes, and neutrophils, can lead to venous and/or arterial thrombosis [1,2].The diagnosis and management of HIT are still challenging [3].HIT is typically defined as (i) a sudden decrease in the platelet count of more than 50% (compared with a baseline value measured before the initiation of heparin treatment), (ii) an event that occurs between 5 and 10 days after treatment initiation, (iii) hypercoagulability status, and (iv) the presence of heparindependent, activating platelet IgG antibodies [1].The incidence of HIT in heparin-treated adults can exceed 1%, depending on the underlying conditions and the duration of treatment [4].This incidence can also be impacted by the type of heparin administered with unfractionated heparin (UFH), conferring a higher HIT risk than low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [2,5].The risk of HIT is generally considered to be lower in children, although the reporting rate in the literature varies from 0% to 2.3% [6][7][8][9][10][11][12].In adults, the highest risk is observed in UFH-treated patients after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); 30% to 50% of patients develop anti-PF4/H antibodies, but fewer than 2% of patients develop HIT [13][14][15][16][17][18].In children over 30 days of age, approximately 50% (as in adults) will develop anti-PF4/H antibodies after cardiac surgery, but only 0.33% will develop HIT [9,10].Even though the immune system is still immature during the neonatal period [19], HIT has also been described in newborns (aged <28 or 30 days, depending on the study) with an estimated reporting rate of 1.5% [20].The development of anti-PF4/H in newborns undergoing cardiac surgery has been explored in a few studies.Most reported the absence of seroconversion in newborns [6,9,11,12,[20][21][22][23][24].

UFH is still the safest choice for newborns requiring anticoagulation [25].Therefore, it is important to clarify the risk of HIT in newborns, as this might affect the management and monitoring of heparin therapy in this vulnerable population.

The objectives of the present study were to review the literature, report rates for HIT in newborns, and determine the incidence of HIT after cardiac surgery in newborns in our pediatric hospital.

## | Literature search and selection strategy

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for English language records published between 1992 and 2021, using the search teams "heparin-induced thrombocytopenia," "HIT," "children," "neonates," "pediatrics," "newborns," "cardiac surgery," "unfractionated heparin," "low-molecularweight heparin," danaparoid," "argatroban," "bivalirudin," and "fondaparinux."The search results were limited to humans and studies that had included newborns (children under 30 days of age).A study was selected if it concerned HIT diagnosis or anti-PF4/H seroconversion in newborns (Figure).Possible duplicate publications were excluded by checking data collection locations and dates.


## | Analysis of case reports

Two raters from our hospital's hematology laboratory (J.G. and D.L.) and 2 from the regional pharmacovigilance center (C.L. and R.A.) independently analyzed all the case reports and, using a specific form, classified each as "likely," "uncertain," or "unlikely" for HIT.The same predefined criteria were applied by all 4 raters and included the 4T score [26], the change in the platelet count after withdrawal of heparin, platelet transfusion, use of CPB and/or extracorporeal life support (ECLS), the detection of anti-PF4/H antibodies (immunoassays), and heparin-dependent platelet activation (functional assays).The rating form is available in Supplementary Table S1.In the event of disagreement (ie, when the 4 classifications of HIT status were not strictly the same), 2 additional raters (one from the hematology laboratory [D.B.] and the other from the pharmacovigilance center [A.L.L.]) were invited to adjudicate.All raters had in-depth experience of HIT in day-to-day clinical practice.If the case was impossible to analyze due to missing data, raters could apply the mention: "not applicable."


## | Experience in our center

Suspected cases of HIT in newborns hospitalized between 2004 and 2020 in our pediatric hospital with medical and surgical specialties,


## Essentials

• Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been described in newborns.

• A wrong diagnosis of neonatal HIT can complicate management.

• The incidence of HIT in newborns has been overestimated in the literature.

• None of the newborns who had undergone cardiac surgery in our hospital were diagnosed with HIT.


## | Statistical analysis

Quantitative data are expressed as the mean ± SD.The degree of concordance between the raters was determined using Fleiss's kappa test for the categorical variable (classification of HIT: likely, uncertain, or unlikely) and the interclass correlation coefficient for the continuous variable (the 4T score).Since all the suspected cases in the literature concerned newborns after cardiac surgery, we determined the incidence of HIT in newborns in our hospital by dividing the number of confirmed cases of HIT by the total number of newborns that had undergone cardiac surgery during the study period.

The incidence of HIT in newborns in our hospital was determined according to an exact binomial test.

## | Study selection

We found 62 articles published between 1992 and 2021.Thirty-one of these were excluded because they involved solely children over  The characteristics of the patients in the selected population studies are summarized in Table 1.Briefly, 9 studies [6,9,11,12,[20][21][22][23][24] concerned newborns (<30 days) exclusively, and the other 2 studies involved newborns and children [8,27].Studies that included children had a separate analysis for those under 30 days of age.The studies dealt with patients receiving heparin after cardiac surgery with or without CPB (50%) or patients in intensive care units administered via a peripheral or central catheter (50%).All patients received UFH, and HIT was suspected in 241 newborns.The suspicion of HIT was mainly triggered by the observation of thrombocytopenia.Among the 241 suspected cases, 29 (12%) developed thrombosis, and 16 (6.6%)had a poor outcome.


### | HIT tests in newborns

Nine studies were eligible for this specific analysis (Table 1).Only in 1 study were patients tested with the 2 recommended standard assays (ie, 42 patients) [22].Three studies described a functional assay as heparin-induced platelet aggregation assays (HIPAs), serotonin release assays (SRAs), or SRA-like [20,22,27].Seventeen (21%) of the 79 tested patients had a positive functional assay.Only 2 (0.9%) of the 204 tested patients had a positive immunologic assay [6,8,9,11,12,22,23].


### | The reporting rate for HIT in newborns

Of the 9 studies involving only newborns (with a total of 1412 receiving heparin), 1 study reported HIT in 14 out of 930 newborns; this corresponds to a reporting rate of 1.5% for HIT [20].HIT antibodies were detected in those 14 newborns using a platelet aggregation assay.Approximately 70% of newborns received UFH; of these,   Eight patients (48%) had been screened with an ELISA for anti-PF4/ H antibodies [8,[32][33][34][35].Of these, only 2 (25%) were strongly positive, 3 were doubtful, and 3 were negative.Seven patients (42%) had been tested with a functional assay (SRA n = 1, SRA-like n = 2, or a HIPA n = 4) [7,[27][28][29][30][31]. Zero, 2, and 3 patients were positive in SRAs, SRA-like, and HIPAs, respectively.Only 1 study used the 4T score [36].Heparin was replaced by argatroban in 6 (36%) patients and by other antithrombotics (aspirin, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, danaparoid, or lepirudin) in 5 patients (30%).In 1 patient (6%), no alternative to heparin was used, and data were not available for 5 (30%) patients.

The outcome was poor for 10 (60%) patients, with either death (n = 7, 41%) or severe complications (limb amputation or persistent thrombocytopenia; n = 3, 18%).


### | Literature cases of pediatric HIT, as analyzed by the raters

The raters' scores and classifications are summarized in Table 3.The degree of concordance between the 4 raters was good according to the interclass correlation coefficient (95% CI, 0.79 [0.59 -0.91]) for the 4T score but not according to Fleiss' kappa (0.0043; P = .96).

There was a perfect agreement for only 8 of the 17 cases: 5 "unlikely," 2 "uncertain," and 1 "not applicable."The 2 additional raters classified the remaining 9 cases as "unlikely" based on the clinical and laboratory criteria.The main reasons for exclusion were the time of occurrence (ie, too soon after surgery), the absence of thrombocytopenia, and missing data.

Lastly, none of the cases was classified as "likely HIT," and only 3 were classified as "uncertain" because of equivocal clinical criteria.

Despite the positivity of an immunoassay, the diagnosis was uncertain because of the absence of thrombocytopenia [8].In another CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HIPA, heparin-induced platelet aggregation; HIT, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin; NA, not available; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; SRA, 14 C serotonin release assay; SRA-like, 14 C serotonin release like assay.+ = positive; -= negative.a The link between death and suspected HIT was not established.
T A B L E 1 (Continued)
Our analysis showed that the cases of HIT in newborns described in the medical literature were poorly documented, and not all of the diagnostic criteria for HIT were met [2].Therefore, the reporting rate might have been overestimated.

In the population-based studies reviewed here, only 42 of the 241 newborns with suspected HIT had been tested with the 2 recommended standard assays (ie, immunoassay and functional assay).Only 19 cases were positive in 1 of the assay types: 2 in an immunoassay and 17 in a functional assay.Apart from the work by Spadone et al.

[20] (performed at a time when appropriate immunoassay tests were not available), the studies did not comply with the guidelines on the diagnosis of HIT [2].

Similarly, none of the 17 newborns with HIT had 2 positive assays in the case reports.Moreover, the only assays performed gave a doubtful result for 4 patients (3 immunoassays and 1 SRA) and were negative for 4 patients (3 immunoassays and 1 HIPA).Functional assays are heterogeneous and poorly standardized, using different methods to study platelet activation with different platelet preparations (platelet-rich plasma or washed platelets).Given the risk of falsepositive functional assays, some publications stress the importance of caution when a functional assay is declared positive if the PF4dependent immunoassay is negative or weakly positive [37].

Furthermore, the immunoassays were often poorly described, with little information provided on the commercial kit or in-house assay (particularly with regard to the detection of IgG and/or IgM) [8,9] and the positivity threshold used (a pediatric-specific value of which was suggested by some authors [8]).

The value of detecting anti-PF4/H antibodies in newborns is subject to debate; IgM is the most commonly found immunoglobulin in newborns because class switching is rare during pregnancy [38].

Although antigen-presenting cells are present after birth, mature B cells able to interact with T cells and lymphoid structures are scarce in newborns, impairing antibody production [39].Moreover, the lack of antigen presentation during fetal life means that the memory B cell count at birth is low.The majority of B cells in newborns are naïve immature B cells [40].One study suggested that anti-PF4/H IgM B cells are present in cord blood and that anti-PF4/H IgM are produced even in the absence of previous exposure to the antigen; this indicated that the response to anti-PF4/H IgM is part of the innate immune system's repertory.Hence, anti-PF4/H IgM antibodies were the predominant class in children receiving UFH for postsurgery anticoagulation after CPB and are already present in newborns, whereas anti-PF4/H IgG antibodies were only found in children older than 6 months [19].

Maternal exposure to UFH should also be considered.Indeed, maternal IgG having passed through the placenta can be detected in an infant for the first 6 months after birth [41].Only one study addressed the question of a possible placental transfer of maternal anti-PF4/H IgG [27].The mothers of the 3 newborns with suspected HIT (with positive SRA) were screened for HIT-associated antibodies in a functional assay, but all were negative.

When HIT is suspected, the current guidelines recommend using the 4T score to estimate the likelihood of this condition [42].The raters' level of concordance was good for the 4T score but not for the final classification of cases as "likely," "uncertain," or "unlikely."The 4T score is recommended for assessing the clinical probability of HIT and can help in the prescription of laboratory analyses [2].Surprisingly, the 4T scores determined by the raters were high (often 6 or more), which corresponds to a high clinical probability of HIT.This might be because HIT was often suspected after the discovery of thrombosis in a newborn being treated with heparin, which adds 2 points to the 4T  [43,44].Although the 4T score has not been validated in pediatric populations, it is nevertheless used in several pediatric institutions because of its perceived usefulness in evaluating the clinical likelihood of HIT.It should also be noted that the 4T score is difficult to apply in the context of cardiac surgery with CPB, and an analysis of the postoperative change in the platelet count is more useful [2,16].

When applying the clinical and laboratory criteria recommended in the 2019 guidelines [2], the experts did not diagnose HIT in any of the newborns described in the case reports.Moreover, in the Cochrane Library, we found 2 systematic reviews on the use of UFH to prolong peripheral intravenous catheter use in newborns; none of the newborns considered (n = 300) developed HIT [45,46].The retrospective analysis of suspected HIT after cardiac surgery in our pediatric hospital over the last 16 years (during which 3000 newborns were treated with UFH, mostly after CPB) did not identify a single case.


## | Limitations

The main limitation of the present literature review was a lack of access to all the clinical and laboratory data needed for the final classification (ie, the results of biological assays, the change in platelet counts after heparin discontinuation, other causes of thrombocytopenia, etc.).Moreover, some of the selected studies were published more than 30 years ago.Laboratory tests have since evolved, and the guidelines for the diagnosis of HIT have changed.Although a retrospective analysis of suspected HIT in our center over the past 16 years failed to identify a single case in this population, anticoagulation protocols may not be the same everywhere, especially in terms of the duration of anticoagulation and the postoperative use of LMWHs.

34 were suspected to have HIT because of thrombocytopenia (platelets <70 G/L) (n = 23), an acute fall (30%-50%) in the platelet count (n = 5), or thrombosis (n = 6) during UFH treatment.The median time interval between the initiation of heparin therapy and the onset of HIT was 22 days.The other studies (n = 482 newborns) did not describe any HIT cases; thus, the reporting rate was 0% [6,9,11,12,21-24].
