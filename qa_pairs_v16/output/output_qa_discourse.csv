In the current studies of BERT's representation space, the term 'embedding' refers to the output vector of a given (typically final) Transformer layer. Wiedemann et al. (2019) find that BERT's contextualized embeddings form distinct and clear clusters corresponding to word senses, which confirms that the basic distributional hypothesis holds for these representations. However, Mickus et al. (2019) note that representations of the same word varies depending on position of the sentence in which it occurs, likely due to NSP objective.

They also find that BERT embeddings occupy a narrow cone in the vector space, and this effect increases from lower to higher layers.

• attending to the word itself, to previous/next words and to the end of the sentence (Raganato and Tiedemann, 2018);

• attending to previous/next tokens,    (Kovaleva et al., 2019) According to Clark et al. (2019), ""attention weight has a clear meaning: how much a particular word will be weighted when computing the next representation for the current word"". However, Kovaleva et al. (2019) showed that most selfattention heads do not directly encode any nontrivial linguistic information, since less than half of them had the ""heterogeneous"" pattern 2 . Much of the model encoded the vertical pattern (attention to [CLS], [SEP], and punctuation tokens), consistent with the observations by Clark et al. (2019). This apparent redundancy must be related to the overparametrization issue (see section 7).

Attention to [CLS] is easy to interpret as attention to an aggregated sentence-level representation, but BERT also attends a lot to [SEP] and punctuation. Clark et al. (2019) hypothesize that periods and commas are simply almost as frequent as [CLS] and [SEP], and the model learns to rely on them. They suggest also that the function of [SEP] might be one of ""no-op"", a signal to ignore the head if its pattern is not applicable to the current case.

[SEP] gets increased attention starting in layer 5, but its importance for prediction drops. If this hypothesis is correct, attention probing studies that excluded the [SEP] and [CLS] tokens (as e.g.  and Htut et al. (2019)) should perhaps be revisited.

Proceeding to the analysis of the ""heterogeneous"" self-attention pattern, a number of studies looked for specific BERT heads with linguistically interpretable functions.

Some BERT heads seem to specialize in certain types of syntactic relations. Htut et al.

(2019) and Clark et al. (2019) report that there are BERT heads that attended significantly more than a random baseline to words in certain syntactic positions. The datasets and methods used in these studies differ, but they both find that there are heads that attend to words in obj role more than the positional baseline. The evidence for nsubj, advmod, and amod has some variation between these two studies. The overall conclusion is also supported by Voita et al. (2019)'s data for the base Transformer in machine translation context. Hoover et al. (2019) hypothesize that even complex dependencies like dobj are encoded by a combination of heads rather than a single head, but this work is limited to qualitative analysis.

Both Clark et al. (2019) and Htut et al. (2019) conclude that no single head has the complete syntactic tree information, in line with evidence of partial knowledge of syntax (see subsection 4.1).  present evidence that attention weights are weak indicators of subjectverb agreement and reflexive anafora. Instead of serving as strong pointers between tokens that should be related, BERT's self-attention weights were close to a uniform attention baseline, but there was some sensitivity to different types of distractors coherent with psycholinguistic data.

Clark et al. (2019) identify a BERT head that can be directly used as a classifier to perform coreference resolution on par with a rule-based system,. Kovaleva et al. (2019) showed that even when attention heads specialize in tracking semantic relations, they do not necessarily contribute to BERT's performance on relevant tasks. Kovaleva et al. (2019) identified two heads of base BERT, in which self-attention maps were closely aligned with annotations of core frame semantic relations (Baker et al., 1998). Although such relations should have been instrumental to tasks such as inference, a head ablation study showed that these heads were not essential for BERT's success on GLUE tasks.","1.

Generally, supervised dependency parsing approaches can be divided into graph-based approaches and transition-based approaches. A graph-based dependency parser searches for the best spanning tree of the graph that is formed by connecting all pairs of words in the input sentence. In the simplest form, a graph-based parser makes the first-order assumption that the score of a dependency tree is the summation of scores of its edges (McDonald et al., 2005). A transition-based dependency parser searches for a sequence of actions that incrementally constructs the parse tree, typically from left to right. While current start-of-the-art approaches have achieved strong results in supervised dependency parsing, their usefulness is limited to resource-rich languages and domains with many annotated datasets.

Cross-Domain and Cross-Lingual Parsing One useful approach to handling the lack of treebank resources in the target domain or language is to adapt a learned parser from a resource-rich source domain or language (Yu et al., 2015;McDonald et al., 2011;Ma and Xia, 2014;Duong et al., 2015). This is very related to unsupervised parsing as both approaches do not rely on treebanks in the target domain or language. However, unsupervised parsing is more challenging because it does not have access to any source treebank either.

Unsupervised Constituency Parsing Constituency parsing aims to discover a constituency tree of the input sentence in which the leaf nodes are words and the non-leaf nodes (nonterminal nodes) represent phrases. Unsupervised constituency parsing is often considered more difficult than unsupervised dependency parsing because it has to induce not only edges but also nodes of a tree. Consequently, there have been far more papers in unsupervised dependency parsing than in unsupervised constituency parsing over the past decade. More recently, however, there is a surge in interest in unsupervised constituency parsing and several novel approaches were proposed in the past two years . While we focus on unsupervised dependency parsing in this paper, most of our discussions on the classification of approaches and recent trends apply to unsupervised constituency parsing as well.

Latent Tree Models with Downstream Tasks Latent tree models treat the parse tree as a latent variable that is used in downstream tasks such as sentiment classification. While no treebank is used in training, these models rely on the performance of the downstream tasks to guide the learning of the latent parse trees. To enable end-to-end learning, the REINFORCE algorithm and the Gumbel-softmax trick (Jang et al., 2017) can be utilized (Yogatama et al., 2016;Choi et al., 2018). There also exists previous work on latent dependency tree models that utilizes structured attention mechanisms (Kim et al., 2017) for applications. Latent tree models differ from unsupervised parsing in that they utilize training signals from downstream tasks and that they aim to improve performance of downstream tasks instead of syntactic parsing.

Traditional generative models are mostly based on probabilistic grammars. To enable efficient inference, they typically make one or more relatively strict conditional independence assumptions. The simplest assumption (a.k.a. the context-free assumption) states that the generation of a token is only dependent on its head token and is independent of anything else. Such assumptions make it possible to decompose the joint probability into a product of component probabilities or scores, leading to tractable inference. However, they also lead to unavailability of useful information (e.g., context and generation history) in generating each token.

Based on their respective independence assumptions, different generative models specify different generation processes of the sentence and parse tree. Paskin (2002) and Carroll and Charniak (1992) choose to first uniformly sample a dependency tree skeleton and then populate the tokens (words) conditioned on the dependency tree in a recursive root-to-leaf manner. The generation of a child token is conditioned on the head token and the dependency direction. In contrast, Klein and Manning (2004) propose the Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) that generates the sentence and the parse tree simultaneously. Without knowing the dependency tree structure, each head token has to sample a decision (conditioned on the head token and the dependency direction) of whether to generate a child token or not before actually generating the child token. Besides, the generation of a child token in DMV is additionally conditioned on the valence, defined as the number of the child tokens already generated from a head token. Headden  propose to also introduce the valence into the condition of decision sampling. Spitkovsky et al. (2012) additionally condition decision and child token generation on sibling words, sentence completeness, and punctuation context. Yang et al. (2020) propose a second-order extension of DMV that incorporates grandparent-child or sibling information. In addition to these generative dependency models, other grammar formalisms have also been used for unsupervised dependency parsing, such as tree substitution grammars (Blunsom and Cohn, 2010) and combinatory categorial grammars (Bisk and Hockenmaier, 2012;Bisk and Hockenmaier, 2013).

Similar tokens may have similar syntactic behaviors in a grammar. For example, all the verbs are very likely to generate a noun to the left as the subject. One way to capture this prior knowledge is to compute generation probabilities from a set of features that conveys syntactic similarity.  use a log-linear model based on manually-designed local morpho-syntactic features (e.g., whether a word is a noun) and Jiang et al. (2016) employ a neural network to automatically learn such features. Both approaches are based on DMV.","1.

21. Both approaches are based on DMV.","sent1: A generative approach models the joint probability of the sentence and the corresponding parse tree.
sent2: Traditional generative models are mostly based on probabilistic grammars.
sent3: To enable efficient inference, they typically make one or more relatively strict conditional independence assumptions.
sent4: The simplest assumption (a.k.a. the context-free assumption) states that the generation of a token is only dependent on its head token and is independent of anything else.
sent5: Such assumptions make it possible to decompose the joint probability into a product of component probabilities or scores, leading to tractable inference.
sent6: However, they also lead to unavailability of useful information (e.g., context and generation history) in generating each token.
sent7: Based on their respective independence assumptions, different generative models specify different generation processes of the sentence and parse tree.
sent8: Paskin (2002) and Carroll and Charniak (1992) choose to first uniformly sample a dependency tree skeleton and then populate the tokens (words) conditioned on the dependency tree in a recursive root-to-leaf manner.
sent9: The generation of a child token is conditioned on the head token and the dependency direction.
sent10: In contrast, Klein and Manning (2004) propose the Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) that generates the sentence and the parse tree simultaneously.
sent11: Without knowing the dependency tree structure, each head token has to sample a decision (conditioned on the head token and the dependency direction) of whether to generate a child token or not before actually generating the child token.
sent12: Besides, the generation of a child token in DMV is additionally conditioned on the valence, defined as the number of the child tokens already generated from a head token.
sent13: Headden  propose to also introduce the valence into the condition of decision sampling.
sent14: Spitkovsky et al. (2012) additionally condition decision and child token generation on sibling words, sentence completeness, and punctuation context.
sent15: Yang et al. (2020) propose a second-order extension of DMV that incorporates grandparent-child or sibling information.
sent16: In addition to these generative dependency models, other grammar formalisms have also been used for unsupervised dependency parsing, such as tree substitution grammars (Blunsom and Cohn, 2010) and combinatory categorial grammars (Bisk and Hockenmaier, 2012;Bisk and Hockenmaier, 2013).

For part-of-speech (POS) tagging, Garrette and Baldridge (2013) limit the time of the annotators to 2 hours resulting in up to 1-2k tokens. Kann et al.

(2020) study languages that have less than 10k labeled tokens in the Universal Dependency project (Nivre et al., 2020) and Loubser and Puttkammer (2020) report that most available datasets for South African languages have 40-60k labeled tokens. The threshold is also task-dependent and more complex tasks might also increase the resource requirements. For text generation,  frame their work as low-resource with 350k labeled training instances. Similar to the task, the resource requirements can also depend on the language. Plank et al. (2016) find that task performance varies between language families given the same amount of limited training data.

Given the lack of a hard threshold for lowresource settings, we see it as a spectrum of resource availability. We, therefore, also argue that more work should evaluate low-resource techniques across different levels of data availability for better comparison between approaches. For instance, Plank et al.

In the computer vision community, this is a popular approach where, e.g., rotating an image is invariant to the classification of an image's content. For text, on the token level, this can be done by replacing words with equivalents, such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017;Dai and Adel, 2020) or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018;Vania et al., 2019). Such replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017;Kobayashi, 2018).

To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts. Operations that (depending on the task) do not change the label include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018;Vania et al., 2019;Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018) and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020). For whole sentences, paraphrasing through backtranslation can be used. This is a popular approach in machine translation where target sentences are back-translated into source sentences (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011;Hoang et al., 2018). An important aspect here is that errors in the source side/features do not seem to have a large negative effect on the generated target text the model needs to predict. It is therefore also used in other text generation tasks like abstract summarization (Parida and Motlicek, 2019) and table-to-text generation (Ma et al., 2019). Back-translation has also been leveraged for text classification (Xie et al., 2020;Hegde and Patil, 2020). This setting assumes, however, the availability of a translation system. Instead, a language model can also be used for augmenting text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020;Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020). It is trained conditioned on a label, i.e., on the subset of the task-specific data with this label. It then generates additional sentences that fit this label. Ding et al. (2020) extend this idea for token level tasks.

Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020). They can, however, also be utilized to augment NLP datasets (Yasunaga et al., 2018;Morris et al., 2020). Instead of manually crafted transformation rules, these methods learn how to apply small perturbations to the input data that do not change the meaning of the text (according to a specific score). This approach is often applied on the level of vector representations. For instance, Grundkiewicz et al. (2019) reverse the augmentation setting by applying transformations that flip the (binary) label. In their case, they introduce errors in correct sentences to obtain new training data for a grammar correction task.

Open Issues: While data augmentation is ubiquitous in the computer vision community and while most of the above-presented approaches are taskindependent, it has not found such widespread use in natural language processing. A reason might be that several of the approaches require an indepth understanding of the language.

The corresponding labels are obtained through a (semi-)automatic process from an external source of information. For named entity recognition (NER), a list of location names might be obtained from a dictionary and matches of tokens in the text with entities in the list are automatically labeled as locations. Distant supervision was introduced by Mintz et al. (2009) for relation extraction (RE) with extensions on multi-instance (Riedel et al., 2010) and multi-label learning (Surdeanu et al., 2012). It is still a popular approach for information extraction tasks like NER and RE where the external information can be obtained from knowledge bases, gazetteers, dictionaries and other forms of structured knowledge sources (Luo et al., 2017;Hedderich and Klakow, 2018;Deng and Sun, 2019;Alt et al., 2019;Ye et al., 2019;Lange et al., 2019a;Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019;Le and Titov, 2019;Cao et al., 2019;Lison et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2021a). The automatic annotation ranges from simple string matching  to complex pipelines including classifiers and manual steps (Norman et al., 2019). This distant supervision using information from external knowledge sources can be seen as a subset of the more general approach of labeling rules. These encompass also other ideas like reg-ex rules or simple programming functions (Ratner et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2019;Adelani et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2020;Lison et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020;Karamanolakis et al., 2021).

While distant supervision is popular for information extraction tasks like NER and RE, it is less prevalent in other areas of NLP. Nevertheless, distant supervision has also been successfully em-  (2020) build a discourse-structure dataset using guidance from sentiment annotations. For topic classification, heuristics can be used in combination with inputs from other classifiers like NER (Bach et al., 2019) or from entity lists (Hedderich et al., 2020). For some classification tasks, the labels can be rephrased with simple rules into sentences. A pretrained language model then judges the label sentence that most likely follows the unlabeled input (Opitz, 2019;). An unlabeled review, for instance, might be continued with ""It was great/bad"" for obtaining binary sentiment labels.

Open Issues: The popularity of distant supervision for NER and RE might be due to these tasks being particularly suited. There, auxiliary data like entity lists is readily available and distant supervision often achieves reasonable results with simple surface form rules. It is an open question whether a task needs to have specific properties to be suitable for this approach. The existing work on other tasks and the popularity in other fields like image classification (Xiao et al., 2015;Li et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2018;Mahajan et al., 2018; suggests, however, that distant supervision could be leveraged for more NLP tasks in the future.

Distant supervision methods heavily rely on auxiliary data. In a low-resource setting, it might be difficult to obtain not only labeled data but also such auxiliary data. Kann et al. (2020) find a large gap between the performance on high-resource and low-resource languages for POS tagging pointing to the lack of high-coverage and error-free dictionaries for the weak supervision in low-resource languages. This emphasizes the need for evaluating such methods in a realistic setting and avoiding to just simulate restricted access to labeled data in a high-resource language.

While distant supervision allows obtaining labeled data more quickly than manually annotating every instance of a dataset, it still requires human interaction to create automatic annotation techniques or to provide labeling rules. This time and effort could also be spent on annotating more gold label data, either naively or through an active learning scheme. Unfortunately, distant supervision papers rarely provide information on how long the creation took, making it difficult to compare these approaches. Taking the human expert into the focus connects this research direction with humancomputer-interaction and human-in-the-loop setups (Klie et al., 2018;Qian et al., 2020).","1.

2 What is Stance?

In order to understand the task of stance detection, we first provide definitions of stance and the stance-taking process. Biber and Finegan (1988) define stance as the expression of a speaker's standpoint and judgement towards a given proposition. Further, Du Bois (2007)) define stance as ""a public act by a social actor, achieved dialogically through overt communicative means, of simultaneously evaluating objects, positioning subjects (self and others), and aligning with other subjects, with respect to any salient dimension of the sociocultural field"", showing that the stance-taking process is affected not only by personal opinions, but also by other external factors such as cultural norms, roles in the institution of the family, etc. Here, we adopt the general definition of stance detection by Küçük and Can (2020): ""for an input in the form of a piece of text and a target pair, stance detection is a classification problem where the stance of the author of the text is sought in the form of a category label from this set: Favor, Against, Neither. Occasionally, the category label of Neutral is also added to the set of stance categories (Mohammad et al., 2016), and the target may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the text"" (Augenstein et al., 2016;Mohammad et al., 2016). Note that the stance detection definitions and the label inventories vary somewhat, depending on the target application (see Section 3).

Finally, stance detection can be distinguished from several other closely related NLP tasks: (i) biased language detection, where the existence of an inclination or tendency towards a particular perspective within a text is explored, (ii) emotion recognition, where the goal is to recognise emotions such as love, anger, etc. in the text, (iii) perspective identification, which aims to find the pointof-view of the author (e.g., Democrat vs. Republican) and the target is always explicit, (iv) sarcasm detection, where the interest is in satirical or ironic pieces of text, often written with the intent of ridicule or mockery, and (v) sentiment analysis, which checks the polarity of a piece of text.","1.

Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1. One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.

Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t. the target claim.

More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).

Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER . To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score. Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points. Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70. Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.

Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"". Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).

Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.

Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.

These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).

A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).

Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.

Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.

Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.","1. In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1.
2. One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance.
3. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead.
4. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a).
5. Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help.
6. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful.
7. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance.
8. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1).
9. Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general.
10. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.
11. Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents.
12. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t.
13. the target claim. More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.
14. Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help.
15. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree.
16. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings.
17. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT.
18. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets.
19. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).
20. Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER .

27. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information.

33. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).
34. Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer.""
35. vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club.
36. "", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers.""
37. (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm.""

In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.
sent55: Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness.
sent56: However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.
sent57: Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance.
sent58: Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models.
sent59: They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets.
sent60: Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.
sent61: They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios.
sent62: Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance.
sent63: Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1.
sent64: The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc.
sent65: Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.","1. What is the focus of this section? sent1

Vosoughi et al. (2018a) further found that fake information spreads faster than factual one, thus advocating for the use of temporal information.

Propagation networks can be homogeneous or heterogeneous (e.g., encompassing news articles, publishers, users, and posts) and they can be analyzed at different scales (e.g., node-level, ego-level, triad-level, community-level and the overall network, as shown in Figure 3, in Appendix) (Zhou and Zafarani, 2019).

At both micro-and macro-scale, they extracted and jointly considered network features, temporal features, and linguistic features. Experiments on PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets revealed that temporal features have maximum contribution, followed by network and linguistic features. Shu et al.

Their experimental results suggest that social context (i.e., network-derived) features are more informative than news content ones. Vosoughi et al.

Due to the growing number of claims disseminated with images, in the current literature, there have been various studies that address the visual content with text for predicting misleading information (Volkova et al., 2019), fake images (Gupta et al., 2013), images shared with misinformation in political groups (Garimella and Eckles, 2020), and fauxtography Wang et al., 2021). Some of these studies attempt to understand how two different modalities are used. Their analyses show that the extension of text with images increases the effectiveness of misleading content. Gupta et al. (2013) highlighted the role of Twitter to spread fake images. This study reports that 86% tweets spreading fake images are retweets. Garimella and Eckles (2020) manually annotated a sample of 2,500 images collected from public WhatsApp groups, and labeled them as misinformation, not misinformation, misinformation already fact-checked, and unclear; however, experiments were conducted with binary labels: misinformation vs. not-misinformation. The authors found that violent and graphic images spread faster. Nakamura et al. (2020) developed a multimodal dataset containing 1M posts including text, images, metadata, and comments collected from Reddit. The dataset was labeled with 2, 3, and 6-ways labels. Volkova et al.

Out of the 15 papers we surveyed, 5 used the 20Newsgroups dataset (Lang, 1995) as a case study, since it has lots of natural artifacts. For example, some punctuation marks appear more often in one class due to the writing styles of the authors contributing to the class, so the model uses these punctuation marks as clues to make predictions. However, because 20Newsgroups is a topic classification dataset, a better model should focus more on the topic of the content since the punctuation marks can also appear in other classes, especially when we apply the model to texts in the wild.

In the absence of strong natural artifacts, bugs can still be simulated using several techniques. First, using only a small subset of labeled data (SS) for training could cause the model to exploit spurious correlation leading to poor performance (Kulesza et al., 2010). Second, injecting wrong labels (WL) into the training data can obviously blunt the model quality (Koh and Liang, 2017).

234093015,A Survey of Data Augmentation Approaches for NLP,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63d8426ba1f51a8525dd19fd8ec92934ec71aea5,Background,6,"What is data augmentation? Data augmentation (DA) encompasses methods of increasing training data diversity without directly collecting more data. Most strategies either add slightly modified copies of existing data or create synthetic data, aiming for the augmented data to act as a regularizer and reduce overfitting when training ML models (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019;Hernández-García and König, 2020). DA has been commonly used in CV, where techniques like cropping, flipping, and color jittering are a standard component of model training. In NLP, where the input space is discrete, how to generate effective augmented examples that capture the desired invariances is less obvious.

What are the goals and trade-offs? Despite challenges associated with text, many DA techniques for NLP have been proposed, ranging from rule-based manipulations (Zhang et al., 2015) to more complicated generative approaches (Liu et al., 2020b). As DA aims to provide an alternative to collecting more data, an ideal DA technique should be both easy-to-implement and improve model performance. Most offer trade-offs between these two.

Rule-based techniques are easy-to-implement but usually offer incremental performance improvements (Li et al., 2017;Wei and Zou, 2019;Wei et al., 2021b). Techniques leveraging trained models may be more costly to implement but introduce more data variation, leading to better performance boosts. Model-based techniques customized for downstream tasks can have strong effects on performance but be difficult to develop and utilize.

Further, the distribution of augmented data should neither be too similar nor too different from the original. This may lead to greater overfitting or poor performance through training on examples not representative of the given domain, respectively. Effective DA approaches should aim for a balance.

Kashefi and Hwa (2020) devise a KL-Divergence-based unsupervised procedure to preemptively choose among DA heuristics, rather than a typical ""run-all-heuristics"" comparison, which can be very time and cost intensive.

Interpretation of DA Dao et al. (2019) note that ""data augmentation is typically performed in an adhoc manner with little understanding of the underlying theoretical principles"", and claim the typical explanation of DA as regularization to be insufficient.

Automatic tools can take over some of the tasks that human moderators typically perform when monitoring online discussions. For example, in Social Sciences, one of the most discussed issues in crowd-scale deliberation is ""flaming"", i.e., aggressive and disrespectful communicative behavior (Lampe et al., 2014). Here, moderators could benefit from hate-speech and trolling detection methods in NLP. NLP methods to support deliberative decisionmaking have already been applied for the realtime visualisation of argument maps (El-Assady et al., 2017). Deliberation in real-time applications has the clear potential of structured arguments extraction from the news media (Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2020), the identification of the argumentative structure in deliberative contexts (Liebeck et al., 2016), as well as automatic argument summarization (Lawrence et al., 2017).

Beyond the real-time support to users (and moderators) provided by the methods described above, further tasks specific to AM which are part of the role of a human or (semi-)automoated moderator include: detecting fallacies (Habernal et al., 2018b), reasoning and common-sense (Habernal et al., 2018a), relevance estimation (Potthast et al., 2019). In addition, detecting and highlighting parts of an argument that are a good target for attacks (Jo et al., 2020a) can help the moderator to motivate more participation and argumentation from opposing sides of a discussion. Another important source is the detection of implicitly asserted prepositions (Jo et al., 2020b) which has a counterpart in the framing detection task (Card et al., 2015;Akyürek et al., 2020), as framing is a manipulation strategy which highlights specific aspects of an issue under discussion to promote certain interpretations.

Further NLP tasks which can play a crucial role in ensuring a healthy interaction are, for example, Hate Speech Detection (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012;Waseem and Hovy, 2016;Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017), Fact Checking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014;Kotonya and Toni, 2020), Facts recognition and source identification (Dusmanu et al., 2017).

How to represent discourse? Thus far, we have discussed the main ingredients of a rich NLP-informed approach to deliberative discourse. These components, together with the deliberationaugmented definition of AQ sketched in section 3 are the features that the NLP moderator takes as an input. One question remains open: How to represent the argumentative discourse within a contribution (e.g. a forum post) and across contributions (e.g. an entire online deliberation campaign)? We can approach also this question from an interdisciplinary perspective. Reference work in political science aims at modeling the mechanisms of political discourse in forms of discourse networks, as defined in Leifeld (2017). A discourse network is a bipartite graph, containing two classes of nodes: actors (e.g. Angela Merkel; the left-wing party; etc.) and claims (e.g. housing opportunities should be established for refugees); Edges between actors and claims indicate the support or opposition of a certain actor to a specific claim. Discourse coalitions (Hajer, 1993) and argumentative clusters are the projection of the affiliation network on the actor and claim sides of the network (Leifeld and Haunss, 2012;Haunss et al., 2013). Recent NLP research has targeted integration machine learning in the discourse network analysis workflow (Padó et al., 2019;Haunss et al., 2020). Crucially for AM, discourse networks can integrate claims and actors with a third class of nodes, the frame nodes, which encode the reason put forward by an actor to support or reject a claim. This type of representation is perfectly compatible with a graph-based approach on argument representation which has already been established as to be preferred to a tree-structure representation both empirically (Niculae et al., 2017) and theoretically (Afantenos and Asher, 2014).

Moderation can thus be modeled as optimization of specific quantitative properties of the discourse network: participant inclusion, can be enforced by ensuring that the contributions of peripheric actor nodes receive the deserved salience; argument mapping and summarization can be modeled by identifying ""hot"" sub-graphs in the network; the impact of a contribution (the grounded notion of AQ we have been advocating thus far) can be quantified as the perturbation introduced in the network, with its long term effects on convergence or polarization.

Who moderates the (NLP) moderators? The problem of biased moderation obviously relates to the issue of bias in NLP (Blodgett et al., 2020;Caliskan et al., 2017;Bolukbasi et al., 2016;Spliethöver and Wachsmuth, 2020) and it has a clear implication in the application of NLP methods to moderation. For example, we would not want our NLP models to infer a negative impact on AQ from cues which just reveal that the user belongs to certain groups. This is a real risk when quality is equated to ""success"", in turn quantified in terms of likes, replies, retweets. The public of a forum may be sensitive to such cues, but the moderator should be unbiased with respect to them. Another source of bias is the degree of literacy of a contribution: while users who express themselves poorly are likely to be less popular with the forum public, their contributions may still be a very good move in the ""cooperation challenge"" -one that moderators (NLP or humans, online or in-person) have to ensure will not be left unexploited.","1.

A discourse network is a bipartite graph, containing two classes of nodes: actors (e.g. Angela Merkel; the left-wing party; etc.) and claims (e.g. housing opportunities should be established for refugees); Edges between actors and claims indicate the support or opposition of a certain actor to a specific claim.
17. Discourse coalitions (Hajer, 1993) and argumentative clusters are the projection of the affiliation network on the actor and claim sides of the network (Leifeld and Haunss, 2012;Haunss et al., 2013).
18. Recent NLP research has targeted integration machine learning in the discourse network analysis workflow (Padó et al., 2019;Haunss et al., 2020).
19. Crucially for AM, discourse networks can integrate claims and actors with a third class of nodes, the frame nodes, which encode the reason put forward by an actor to support or reject a claim.
20. This type of representation is perfectly compatible with a graph-based approach on argument representation which has already been established as to be preferred to a tree-structure representation both empirically (Niculae et al., 2017) and theoretically (Afantenos and Asher, 2014).
21. Moderation can thus be modeled as optimization of specific quantitative properties of the discourse network: participant inclusion, can be enforced by ensuring that the contributions of peripheric actor nodes receive the deserved salience; argument mapping and summarization can be modeled by identifying ""hot"" sub-graphs in the network; the impact of a contribution (the grounded notion of AQ we have been advocating thus far) can be quantified as the perturbation introduced in the network, with its long term effects on convergence or polarization.
22. Who moderates the (NLP) moderators?
23. The problem of biased moderation obviously relates to the issue of bias in NLP (Blodgett et al., 2020;Caliskan et al., 2017;Bolukbasi et al., 2016;Spliethöver and Wachsmuth, 2020) and it has a clear implication in the application of NLP methods to moderation.
24. For example, we would not want our NLP models to infer a negative impact on AQ from cues which just reveal that the user belongs to certain groups.
25. This is a real risk when quality is equated to ""success"", in turn quantified in terms of likes, replies, retweets.
26. The public of a forum may be sensitive to such cues, but the moderator should be unbiased with respect to them.
27. Another source of bias is the degree of literacy of a contribution: while users who express themselves poorly are likely to be less popular with the forum public, their contributions may still be a very good move in the ""cooperation challenge"" -one that moderators (NLP or humans, online or in-person) have to ensure will not be left unexploited.","sent1: NLP-supported moderation represents a clear solution to the bottleneck problem affecting facilitation in digital democracy.
sent2: Automatic tools can take over some of the tasks that human moderators typically perform when monitoring online discussions.
sent3: For example, in Social Sciences, one of the most discussed issues in crowd-scale deliberation is ""flaming"", i.e., aggressive and disrespectful communicative behavior (Lampe et al., 2014).
sent4: Here, moderators could benefit from hate-speech and trolling detection methods in NLP.
sent5: NLP methods to support deliberative decisionmaking have already been applied for the realtime visualisation of argument maps (El-Assady et al., 2017).
sent6: Deliberation in real-time applications has the clear potential of structured arguments extraction from the news media (Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2020), the identification of the argumentative structure in deliberative contexts (Liebeck et al., 2016), as well as automatic argument summarization (Lawrence et al., 2017).
sent7: Beyond the real-time support to users (and moderators) provided by the methods described above, further tasks specific to AM which are part of the role of a human or (semi-)automoated moderator include: detecting fallacies (Habernal et al., 2018b), reasoning and common-sense (Habernal et al., 2018a), relevance estimation (Potthast et al., 2019).
sent8: In addition, detecting and highlighting parts of an argument that are a good target for attacks (Jo et al., 2020a) can help the moderator to motivate more participation and argumentation from opposing sides of a discussion.
sent9: Another important source is the detection of implicitly asserted prepositions (Jo et al., 2020b) which has a counterpart in the framing detection task (Card et al., 2015;Akyürek et al., 2020), as framing is a manipulation strategy which highlights specific aspects of an issue under discussion to promote certain interpretations.
sent10: Further NLP tasks which can play a crucial role in ensuring a healthy interaction are, for example, Hate Speech Detection (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012;Waseem and Hovy, 2016;Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017), Fact Checking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014;Kotonya and Toni, 2020), Facts recognition and source identification (Dusmanu et al., 2017).How to represent discourse?
sent11: Thus far, we have discussed the main ingredients of a rich NLP-informed approach to deliberative discourse.
sent12: These components, together with the deliberationaugmented definition of AQ sketched in section 3 are the features that the NLP moderator takes as an input.
sent13: One question remains open: How to represent the argumentative discourse within a contribution (e.g. a forum post) and across contributions (e.g. an entire online deliberation campaign)?
sent14: We can approach also this question from an interdisciplinary perspective.
sent15: Reference work in political science aims at modeling the mechanisms of political discourse in forms of discourse networks, as defined in Leifeld (2017).
sent16: A discourse network is a bipartite graph, containing two classes of nodes: actors (e.g. Angela Merkel; the left-wing party; etc.) and claims (e.g. housing opportunities should be established for refugees); Edges between actors and claims indicate the support or opposition of a certain actor to a specific claim.

236460206,Towards Argument Mining for Social Good: A Survey,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcb0b23685c9c116d8d53fe47e5157753659d3bd,Grounding AQ in deliberation: moderation as a real-world application,10,"Grounding AQ in a discourse perspective which quantifies ""team-playing"" and its impact on discourse dynamics is a clear challenge, both theoretically, in the Social Sciences and Argumentation Theory, and concretely, as the empirical quantification of discourse-grounded AQ will require large annotation efforts, real-time implementations, and thorough evaluation strategies. We propose to make a first step in tackling this challenge by mapping it into a concrete application: (semi-)automatic moderation implemented as a form of discourse optimization, or, as it is commonly referred to in the Social Sciences, facilitation (Kaner et al., 2007;Trénel, 2009). To illustrate the dynamics of moderation, let us start from concrete examples from a deliberation platform, RegulationRoom. This discussion forum has been employed by public institutions to gather citizens contributions on discussions targeting very heterogeneous issues (more details can be found in Appendix). Let us consider the following example from a discussion on the distracted driving by commercial vehicle operators (e.g., truckers and bus drivers). The posts we selected (arrows indicate comment nesting) are from the discussion sub-thread: Texting -what are the risks? 5 The example involves two users who clearly differ in their argumentation style and position. User 1 has a clear position on the topic (claim in bold: not just texting, but all cellphone interactions should be banned), which she/he supports with personal reports (underlined text) an emotional tone, and a style which is typical of social media text. User 2 replies, opening the post on a sarcastic note, which serves as the first premise to her/his (implicit) claim which is encoded in three rethorical questions (in bold): there should be no restrictions at all, because imposing them would be unfair. This is the case because (premises underlined): any distraction can cause an accident, some people are capable of using their phone while driving, people who spend lot of time in the car for professional reasons still need to communicate with loved ones. A moderator then joins the discussion to (a) provide a clarification as to why the focus is on texting and a link to further information on the matter, and (b) ask User 2 to elaborate on the personal communication issue, and to propose alternatives. In the Appendix we report another example from the same topic and thread, where the user acts as a problematizer, challenging the scope and definition of the rule under discussion and the moderator acts as a ""discourse traffic director"", pointing out that the user should read and contribute to different threads in the discussion.

The guidelines for human moderators in Reg-ulationRoom have been defined in advance in a 'moderator protocol' (eRulemaking Initiative et al., 2017) which reflect the moderator actions mentioned in the examples. In the protocol the moderator roles were divided into two main classes. Supervision functions include general moderator actions that do not necessarily target the specific content of the posts, e.g., greeting participants, monitoring compliance with netiquette (policing), or helping with technical difficulties. Substantive moderator functions aim to improve the quality of comments and promote fruitful discourse. As the examples above clearly show, this can both mean that the moderator encourages exchanges between discourse participants and participation in other posts (broadening the scope of the discussion), or helping users to improve the content of their posts (requests for clarification, focusing on one topic, substantive reasoning, sharing personal experiences).

RegulationRoom represents an excellent example of the beneficial role of the moderator in maintaining productive argumentation from participants. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little to no NLP work targeting moderation modeling. Park et al. (2012) used data from Regula-tionRoom and conducted an annotation study to empirically categorize the types of moderator interventions specified in the moderator protocol. Classification experiments were conducted using SVM to predict the type of action a moderator would perform, given the previous comment. However this work is limited as it only focuses on two types of moderator interventions (broadening the scope of the discussion, improving argument quality) and as it does not predict whether the moderator should intervene, building on the assumption that a given comment has already been flagged as ""in need for moderation"".

Besides the concrete example of Regulation-Room, moderation and discourse facilitation have been, and still are, a crucial topic in digital democracy. 6 The know-how of digital democracy experts is an invaluable starting point for the application of AM to moderation, as current research targets both the integration of digital solutions to facilitate online campaigns, and a critical reflection of the effects of such innovations on the deliberation outcomes.

Digital innovation supporting deliberation Argument maps (Walton, 2005) are widely employed to support online discussions, as an emerging optimization of the deliberation. Given a specific topic, for example possible reactions to climate change, users who wish to contribute to the discussion are requested to structure their contribution by producing an item in a conceptual map and optionally writing an accompanying post. Their contribution to the argument maps is often reviewed by a moderator. So in a sense, the argument map for a given deliberation process is the outcome of a process that comes both from below (the user) and above (the moderator).

Thanks to argument maps, the overall discourse picture can be overviewed and it is easier for the group of contributors to express support for one (or many) of the available options, without having to read a large number of long posts. An example of this approach is represented in Deliberatorium 7 , an e-deliberation platform which has been extensively employed in many reference studies on the effect of digital innovation on deliberation (Klein, 2011). Another example of a digital deliberation platform which integrates argument maps and offers an option for moderation is COLAGREE (Yang et al., 2021;Ito, 2018). Among the studies testing the impact of such digital platforms on online deliberation, Spada et al. (2015) tests the effect of Deliberatorium's argument maps on an online discussion among the supporters of the Italian Democratic party concerning the desired features of electoral law to be proposed by the party to the Parliament. This study compared the discussion of users employing Deliberatorium and a control group using a traditional forum format which was then encoded into argument maps. The comparison showed that the argument map modality did not discourage participation, and while it appeared to make users less creative (fewer new ideas as compared to the traditional forum), it also reduced the rate of claims without further discussion.

Yet, the need for trained moderators tends to be a significant bottleneck (both in terms of time and of costs) in digital deliberation. Moreover, empirical research on the effect of moderation on deliberation has uncovered the risks of biased moderation. For example, the experiment in Spada and Vreeland (2013) tests the extent to which moderators can influence participants' behavior by expressing their views during the moderation process.","1.

236460206,Towards Argument Mining for Social Good: A Survey,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcb0b23685c9c116d8d53fe47e5157753659d3bd,Scaling Up Argument Mining,11,"In social media While overtly argumentative text, like those described above, represents the natural domain of application for AM, social media constitute a powerful source of large amounts of data (billions of words) despite facing particular challenges in AM.

Social media plays an increasingly significant role in modern political and social discourse, yet resources built for conducting AM on this type of data structure remain limited for clear reasons. These platforms inherently collect and spread a wide range of content, including personal opinions, facts, fake news, and additional information of interest to users. Distinguishing between personal opinion, fact, and fake news, for example, is not always straightforward, as seen in recent work on fake news detection (Kotonya and Toni, 2020). Further, the language used on such platforms is infamously chaotic and often non-standard in comparison to the language use in more structured environments, like parliamentary debates. The combination of these aspects introduces the unique challenge of implementing AM to particularly heterogeneous, poorly annotated data.

Recent work has aimed to tackle such challenges in social media. Dusmanu et al. (2017) apply a supervised classification approach to identify arguments on Twitter, focusing on the tasks of facts recognition and source identification. They study the feasibility of the approaches proposed to address these tasks on a set of tweets related to the Grexit and Brexitnews topics. Habernal and Gurevych (2017) provide an extensive analysis of the steps and the modeling strategies necessary to analyze social media data (e.g. forum posts) in terms of their argumentative structure, while Simpson and Gurevych (2018) tackle the issue of the scalability of AM algorithms.

Despite the rising attention and developments to AM in social media, one of the major challenges currently facing the field is the lack of consensus on how exactly to analyse argumentative user-generated texts such as online comments (Bauwelinck and Lefever, 2020). On the one hand, the amount of annotations available for the scale of this heterogeneous data remains limited. Recent work by Schaefer and Stede (2020), among others, have aimed to construct large Twitter corpora annotated for argument components, including argumentative spans within tweets. On the other hand, annotation guidelines are not necessarily clear, and the theoretical motivations underlying the proposed guidelines used to generate labelled corpora rarely include motivation for the use of a particular theoretical basis. Bauwelinck and Lefever (2020) introduce a pilot study and aim to provide a clear justification of the theories and definitions underlying the design of a set of guidelines.

The linguistic, structural, and logistic complexity and ""openness"" of such platforms clearly present unique challenges. However, being able to work well with argumentative text from social media and discussion forums is essential considering the continuously growing impact on the political and social framework of modern times.

Multilingual argument mining Multilinguality is an important area of research in NLP that has gained more attention recently because of the crosslingual transfer potentials of Pre-trained Language Models (Devlin et al., 2019;Conneau et al., 2020) and because of the potentials for a societal impact at a global scale. The latter is particularly important when considering AM for Social Good since language should not be a barrier for participation if the goal is to allow any productive contribution.

Various recent studies have investigated multilinguality for AM. Eger et al. (2019) discuss a series of experiments on using machine translation and annotation projection for AM, specifically argument components extraction and classification in German, English, and Chinese. A similar approach to build training data in other languages using machine translation is done in Toledo-Ronen et al. (2020), which use a pre-trained multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for modeling. This approach is shown to perform well for classifying argument stance and detecting evidence, but not for predicting argument quality scores. Multilingual stance detection in political social media text (Vamvas and Sennrich, 2020) is also investigated in Lai et al. (2020) using stylistic, structural, affective and contextual features from text and analysing the scenarios in which each of these features is effective.

Other work has also dealt with building non-English datasets (Lindahl, 2020;Bauwelinck and Lefever, 2020;Schaefer and Stede, 2020;Zotova et al., 2020), but there still seems to be a focus on Indo-European languages (and sometimes Chinese) with a lack of datasets and analysis extending to other languages. This is a general issue in NLP research that extends to performance bias in favor of standard dialects for example in English (Blodgett et al., 2016) and bias that could target certain user groups instead of protecting them as was shown for Hate Speech Detection (Davidson et al., 2019). This is an important limitation to address in AM as well for more inclusivity and towards a more positive societal impact.","1.

Some acquire their languages simultaneously from birth, while others acquire them sequentially, either naturally or via explicit instruction. Multilingualism is the norm in many zones where local residents may speak different languages to accommodate their interlocutors. Speakers who use local dialects or minoritized varieties may also be engaged in C-S when switching between their variety and a dominant one (Mills and Washington, 2015;Blom and Gumperz, 1972). C-S in bilingual language acquisition of children has been studied across language contact contexts in Europe. In Germany, Herkenrath (2012) and Pfaff (1999) focused on Turkish-German C-S and Meisel (1994) on German-French C-S of bilingual children. From a comparative perspective, Poeste et al. (2019) analyzed C-S among bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual children growing up in Spain and Germany. In the Netherlands, Bosma and Blom (2019) focused on C-S among bilingual Frisian-Dutch children. In addition to analyzing C-S in children's speech, Juan-Garau and Perez-Vidal (2001) and Lanza (1998) investigated C-S in the interaction patterns between bilingual children and their parents (i.e. Spanish-Catalan and English-Norwegian respectively).

Within an educational setting, Kleeman (2012) observed C-S among bilingual (North Sami-Norwegian) kindergarten children in the North of Norway. Similarly, Jørgensen (1998) and Cromdal (2004) report the use of C-S for resolving disputes among bilingual (Turkish-Danish) children in Denmark and multilingual (Swedish-English and/or a Non-Scandinavian Language) children in Sweden respectively.

C-S does not only take place between standard languages but between minority languages and dialects as well. For example, Themistocleous (2013) studied C-S between Greek and Cypriot Greek and Deuchar (2006) focused on the C-S between Welsh and English in the UK. Berruto (2005) reports cases of language mixing between standard Italian and Italoromance dialects in Italy. In the Balkans, Kyuchukov (2006) analyzed C-S between Turkish-Bulgarian and Romani in Bulgaria. C-S between dialects and/or standard vs. minority languages in computer mediated interaction was analyzed by Siebenhaar (2006) among Swiss-German dialects and by Robert-Tissot and Morel (2017) through SMS corpora collected across Germanic (i.e. English and German) and Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian) in Switzerland.

C-S is commonly observable across immigrant contexts in Europe. In the UK, Georgakopoulou and Finnis (2009) described the C-S patterns between English and Cypriot Greek while Issa (2006) focused on the C-S between English and Cypriot Turkish communities in London. Wei and Milroy (1995) analyzed the C-S between English and Chinese from a conversational analysis point of view based on the interactions of bilingual (Chinese-English) families in Northeastern England. In addition, Ożańska-Ponikwia (2016) investigated the Polish-English C-S in the UK as well. C-S among immigrant community members have also been widely studied in Germany (e.g. Turkish-German C-S by Keim (2008) and Ç etinoglu (2017), Russian-German C-S by Khakimov (2016)). In the Netherlands, C-S studies include Turkish-Dutch C-S by Backus (2010) and Dutch-Morroccan C-S by Nortier (1990). In Belgium, Meeuws and Blommaert (1998) studied the French-Lingala-Swahili C-S among immigrants of Zaire and Treffers-Daller (1994) studied French-Dutch C-S in Brussels. In Spain, Jieanu (2013) describes the Romanian-Spanish C-S among the Romanian immigrants. In addition to the C-S analyses within spoken interactions of immigrant communities across Europe, there are also studies about C-S within computer mediated communication as well. These studies include Greek-German C-S by Androutsopoulos (2015) in Germany, Turkish-Dutch C-S by Papalexakis et al. (2014), Papalexakis and Dogruöz (2015) and a comparison of Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch C-S by Dorleijn and Nortier (2009) in the Netherlands. Similarly, Marley (2011) compared French-Arabic C-S within computer mediated interaction across Moroccan communities in France and the UK.

In addition to daily communication, some linguists are also interested in the C-S observed in historical documents. While Swain (2002) explored Latin-Greek C-S by Cicero (Roman Statesman), Dunkel (2000) analyzed C-S in his communication with Atticus (Roman philosopher who studied in Athens) in the Roman Empire. Argenter (2001) reports cases of language mixing within the Catalan Jewish community (in Spain) in the 14th and 15th centuries and Rothman (2011) highlights the C-S between Italian, Slavic and Turkish in the historical documents about Ottoman-Venetian relations. In Switzerland, Volk and Clematide (2014) worked on detecting and annotating C-S patterns in diachronic and multilingual (English, French, German, Italian, Romansh and Swiss German) Alpine Heritage corpus.

Within the media context, Martin (1998) investigated English C-S in written French advertising, and Onysko (2007) investigated the English C-S in German written media through corpus analyses. Zhiganova (2016) indicates that German speakers perceive C-S into English for advertising purposes with both positive and negative consequences.

Similar to humans, institutions and/or organizations could also have multilingual communication with their members and/or audience. For example, Wodak et al. (2012) analyzed the C-S and language choice at the institutional level for European Union institutions.","1. The contexts in which people acquire and use multiple languages in Europe are diverse.

sent5: In Germany, Herkenrath (2012) and Pfaff (1999) focused on Turkish-German C-S and Meisel (1994) on German-French C-S of bilingual children.
sent6: From a comparative perspective, Poeste et al. (2019) analyzed C-S among bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual children growing up in Spain and Germany.
sent7: In the Netherlands, Bosma and Blom (2019) focused on C-S among bilingual Frisian-Dutch children.
sent8: In addition to analyzing C-S in children's speech, Juan-Garau and Perez-Vidal (2001) and Lanza (1998) investigated C-S in the interaction patterns between bilingual children and their parents (i.e. Spanish-Catalan and English-Norwegian respectively).
sent9: Within an educational setting, Kleeman (2012) observed C-S among bilingual (North Sami-Norwegian) kindergarten children in the North of Norway.
sent10: Similarly, Jørgensen (1998) and Cromdal (2004) report the use of C-S for resolving disputes among bilingual (Turkish-Danish) children in Denmark and multilingual (Swedish-English and/or a Non-Scandinavian Language) children in Sweden respectively.
sent11: C-S does not only take place between standard languages but between minority languages and dialects as well.
sent12: For example, Themistocleous (2013) studied C-S between Greek and Cypriot Greek and Deuchar (2006) focused on the C-S between Welsh and English in the UK.
sent13: Berruto (2005) reports cases of language mixing between standard Italian and Italoromance dialects in Italy.
sent14: In the Balkans, Kyuchukov (2006) analyzed C-S between Turkish-Bulgarian and Romani in Bulgaria.
sent15: C-S between dialects and/or standard vs. minority languages in computer mediated interaction was analyzed by Siebenhaar (2006) among Swiss-German dialects and by Robert-Tissot and Morel (2017) through SMS corpora collected across Germanic (i.e. English and German) and Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian) in Switzerland.C-S is commonly observable across immigrant contexts in Europe.
sent16: In the UK, Georgakopoulou and Finnis (2009) described the C-S patterns between English and Cypriot Greek while Issa (2006) focused on the C-S between English and Cypriot Turkish communities in London.
sent17: Wei and Milroy (1995) analyzed the C-S between English and Chinese from a conversational analysis point of view based on the interactions of bilingual (Chinese-English) families in Northeastern England.
sent18: In addition, Ożańska-Ponikwia (2016) investigated the Polish-English C-S in the UK as well.
sent19: C-S among immigrant community members have also been widely studied in Germany (e.g. Turkish-German C-S by Keim (2008) and Ç etinoglu (2017), Russian-German C-S by Khakimov (2016)).
sent20: In the Netherlands, C-S studies include Turkish-Dutch C-S by Backus (2010) and Dutch-Morroccan C-S by Nortier (1990).
sent21: In Belgium, Meeuws and Blommaert (1998) studied the French-Lingala-Swahili C-S among immigrants of Zaire and Treffers-Daller (1994) studied French-Dutch C-S in Brussels.
sent22: In Spain, Jieanu (2013) describes the Romanian-Spanish C-S among the Romanian immigrants.
sent23: In addition to the C-S analyses within spoken interactions of immigrant communities across Europe, there are also studies about C-S within computer mediated communication as well.
sent24: These studies include Greek-German C-S by Androutsopoulos (2015) in Germany, Turkish-Dutch C-S by Papalexakis et al. (2014), Papalexakis and Dogruöz (2015) and a comparison of Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch C-S by Dorleijn and Nortier (2009) in the Netherlands.
sent25: Similarly, Marley (2011) compared French-Arabic C-S within computer mediated interaction across Moroccan communities in France and the UK.
sent26: In addition to daily communication, some linguists are also interested in the C-S observed in historical documents.
sent27: While Swain (2002) explored Latin-Greek C-S by Cicero (Roman Statesman), Dunkel (2000) analyzed C-S in his communication with Atticus (Roman philosopher who studied in Athens) in the Roman Empire.
sent28: Argenter (2001) reports cases of language mixing within the Catalan Jewish community (in Spain) in the 14th and 15th centuries and Rothman (2011) highlights the C-S between Italian, Slavic and Turkish in the historical documents about Ottoman-Venetian relations.
sent29: In Switzerland, Volk and Clematide (2014) worked on detecting and annotating C-S patterns in diachronic and multilingual (English, French, German, Italian, Romansh and Swiss German) Alpine Heritage corpus.
sent30: Within the media context, Martin (1998) investigated English C-S in written French advertising, and Onysko (2007) investigated the English C-S in German written media through corpus analyses.
sent31: Zhiganova (2016) indicates that German speakers perceive C-S into English for advertising purposes with both positive and negative consequences.
sent32: Similar to humans, institutions and/or organizations could also have multilingual communication with their members and/or audience.
sent33: For example, Wodak et al. (2012) analyzed the C-S and language choice at the institutional level for European Union institutions.","1. What are the contexts in which people acquire and use multiple languages in Europe? sent1

There are 121 major languages and 1599 other languages in India, out of which 22 (Assamese, Bangla, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Urdu) are scheduled languages with an official recognition (almost 97% of the population speaks one of the scheduled languages). Most of the population ( 93%) speak languages from the Indo-Aryan (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Assamese, Maithili, Odia) and Dravidian (Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil) language families. The census excludes languages with a population lower than 10,000 speakers. Given this, it is probably difficult to find monolingual speakers in India considering the linguistic diversity and wide-spread multilingualism. Kachru (1978) provides one of the early studies on the types and functions of C-S in India with a historical understanding of the multilingual context.

In addition to the mutual influences and convergence of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages internally, he mentions Persian and English as outside influences on Indian languages. Similarly, Sridhar (1978) provides an excellent comparative overview about the functions of C-S in Kannada in relation to the Perso-Arabic vs. English influences. Kumar (1986) gives examples about the formal (e.g. within NPs, PPs, VPs) and functional (i.e. social and stylistic) aspects of Hindi-English C-S from a theoretical point of view. More recently, Doley (2013) explains how fish mongers in a local fish market in Assam adjust and switch between Assamese, English and local languages strategically to sell their products to multilingual clientele. Another observation about C-S in daily life comes from Boro (2020) who provides examples of English, Assamese and Bodo (another language spoken in the Assam region) C-S and borrowings. In addition to English, Portuguese was also in contact with the local languages as a result colonization in South India. For example, Kapp (1997) explains the Portuguese influence through borrowings in Dravidian languages (i.e. Kannada and Telugu) spoken in India.

Instead of automatic data collection and methods of analyses, the C-S examples for the abovementioned studies are (probably) encountered and collected by the authors themselves in daily life interactions over a period of time with limited means. Nowadays, these small sets of data would be regarded as insignificant in computational areas of research. However, ignoring these studies and data could have serious consequences since crucial information about the social and cultural dynamics in a multilingual setting would also be lost. For example, Nadkarni (1975) proves this point by explaining how social factors influence the C-S between Saraswat Brahmin dialect of Konkani (Indo-Aryan language) and Kannada (Dravidian language) in the South of India. Both languages have been in contact with each other for over four hundred years. Saraswat Brahmins are fluent in both Konkani and Kannada but they do not speak Konkani with Kannada speakers and they also do not C-S between Konkani and Kannada. Nadkarni (1975) attributes this preference to the high prestige associated with Konkani within the given social context. Since Kannada (perceived as less prestigious) is widely spoken in that region, Konkani speakers learn and speak Kannada for functional purposes in daily life which does not involve C-S. However, it is not common for Kannada speakers to learn and speak Konkani (Nadkarni, 1975).

C-S in India has been investigated through written media, advertising and film industry as well. Si (2011) analyzed Hindi-English C-S in the scripts of seven Bollywood movies which were filmed between 1982 and 2004. Her results indicate a change of direction C-S over the years. More specifically, Hindi was the dominant language with occasional switches to English for the early productions but English became the dominant language especially for younger generations in the later productions. A similar trend has been observed for Bengali movie scripts as well. Through analyzing movie scripts (between 1970s and 2010s), Chatterjee (2016) finds a drastic increase in the use of bilingual verbs (e.g. renovate koreche ""renovation do"") over time and attributes this rise to the increasing popularity of English in Indian society. Within the immigrant context, Gardner-Chloros and Charles (2007) focused on the types and functions of C-S between Hindi and English across the TV programs (e.g. highly scripted vs. loosely scripted programs) of a British/Asian cable channel in the UK. Although they have come across C-S in a variety of TV shows, the least amount of C-S was encountered in the news broadcasts (i.e. highly scripted). In general, they have encountered less C-S on TV broadcasts in comparison to the natural speech and attribute this factor to the consciousness of TV personalities about pure language use (instead of C-S). Similarly, Zipp (2017) analyzed Gujarati-English C-S within a radio show targeting British South Asians living in the US and concluded that C-S was part of identity construction among youngsters (group identity). Pratapa and Choudhury (2017) perform a quantitative study of 18 recent Bollywood (Hindi) movies and find that C-S is used for establishing identity, social dynamics between characters and the socio-cultural context of the movie.

From an advertising point of view, Kathpalia and Wee Ong (2015) analyzed C-S in Hinglish (i.e. Hindi, English, Urdu, Sanskrit according to their definition) billboards about the Amul brand in India. After compiling the advertisements on billboards (1191), they classified the structures and functions of C-S. Their results indicate more intrasentential C-S than intersentential ones on the billboards. In terms of function, the advertisers used C-S to indicate figures of speech (e.g. puns, associations, contradictory associations, word-creation and repetitions) to attract the attention of the target group. Mohanty (2006) provides an extended overview of the multilingual education system in India exploring the types and quality of schools across a wide spectrum. In general, high-cost English Medium (EM) education is valued by upper-class and affluent families. Although low-cost EM education is also available for lower income families, he questions its impact in comparison to education in the local languages. Sridhar (2002) explains that C-S is commonly practiced among students in schools across India. In addition, she finds it unrealistic to ask the students to separate the two languages harshly. In immigrant contexts, Martin et al. (2006) investigates how Gujarati-English C-S is used among the South Asian students in educational settings in the UK. Another analysis reveals a shift from Bengali toward English among the younger generations of the immigrant Bengali community in the UK (Al-Azami, 2006). In terms of the C-S patterns, first generation immigrants integrate English words while speaking Bengali whereas English dominates the conversations of younger generations with occasional switches to Bengali. There are also studies about Bengali-English C-S in the UK school settings (Pagett, 2006) and Bangladesh (Obaidullah, 2016) as well. However, a systematic comparison between Bengali-English C-S in India, Bangladesh and immigrant settings are lacking.

In their study about aphasic patients, Shyamala Chengappa and Bhat (2004) report increased frequency of C-S between Malayalam and English for aphasic patients in comparison to the control group. However, there were less differences between the groups in terms of functions of C-S. Deepa and Shyamala (2019) find that amount and types of C-S could be used to differentiate between healthy and mild dementia patients who are bilingual in Kannada and English. Although both studies are carried out with limited subjects, they offer insights about the use of C-S in health settings as well.","1.

sent37: Mohanty (2006) provides an extended overview of the multilingual education system in India exploring the types and quality of schools across a wide spectrum.
sent38: In general, high-cost English Medium (EM) education is valued by upper-class and affluent families.
sent39: Although low-cost EM education is also available for lower income families, he questions its impact in comparison to education in the local languages.
sent40: Sridhar (2002) explains that C-S is commonly practiced among students in schools across India.
sent41: In addition, she finds it unrealistic to ask the students to separate the two languages harshly.
sent42: In immigrant contexts, Martin et al. (2006) investigates how Gujarati-English C-S is used among the South Asian students in educational settings in the UK.
sent43: Another analysis reveals a shift from Bengali toward English among the younger generations of the immigrant Bengali community in the UK (Al-Azami, 2006).
sent44: In terms of the C-S patterns, first generation immigrants integrate English words while speaking Bengali whereas English dominates the conversations of younger generations with occasional switches to Bengali.
sent45: There are also studies about Bengali-English C-S in the UK school settings (Pagett, 2006) and Bangladesh (Obaidullah, 2016) as well.
sent46: However, a systematic comparison between Bengali-English C-S in India, Bangladesh and immigrant settings are lacking.
sent47: In their study about aphasic patients, Shyamala Chengappa and Bhat (2004) report increased frequency of C-S between Malayalam and English for aphasic patients in comparison to the control group.
sent48: However, there were less differences between the groups in terms of functions of C-S. Deepa and Shyamala (2019) find that amount and types of C-S could be used to differentiate between healthy and mild dementia patients who are bilingual in Kannada and English.
sent49: Although both studies are carried out with limited subjects, they offer insights about the use of C-S in health settings as well.","1. What is the linguistic diversity and multilingualism context in India? sent1, sent2, sent3, sent4, sent5

For example, there is no widely-used spoken dialogue system that can understand as well as produce code-switched speech, although some voice assistants may recognize and produce C-S in limited scenarios in some locales. Although computational implementations of grammatical models of C-S exist (Bhat et al., 2016), they do not necessarily generate natural C-S utterances that a bilingual speaker would produce (Pratapa et al., 2018). Most crucially, current computational approaches to C-S language technologies do not usually take into account the linguistic and social factors that influence why and when speakers/users choose to code-switch.

Bawa et al. (2020) conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study using a Hindi-English chatbot and found that not only did bilingual users prefer chatbots that could code-switch, they also showed a preference towards bots that mimicked their own C-S patterns. Rudra et al. (2016) report a study on 430k tweets from Hindi-English bilingual users and find that Hindi is preferred for the expression of negative sentiment. In a follow-up study, Agarwal et al. (2017) find that Hindi is the preferred language for swearing in Hindi-English C-S tweets, and swearing may be a motivating factor for users to switch to Hindi. The study also finds a gender difference, with women preferring to swear in English more often than Hindi. Such studies indicate that multilingual chatbots and intelligent agents need to be able to adapt to users' linguistic styles, while also being capable of determining when and how to code-switch.

Due to the paucity of user-facing systems and standard benchmarks covering only a handful of simpler NLP tasks, it is likely that we overestimate how well computational models are able to handle C-S. In sum, language technologies for C-S seem to be constrained by the lack of availability of diverse C-S training data, evaluation benchmarks and the absence of user-facing applications. They need to go beyond pattern recognition and grammatical constraints of C-S in order to process and produce C-S the way humans do.

This requires extensive amount of expertise and efforts, and might still suffer from human or subjective biases in the end. How to proactively discover and identify models' unrobust regions automatically and comprehensively remains challenging.

Interpreting and Mitigating Spurious Correlations Interpretability matters for large NLP models, especially key to the robustness and spurious patterns.

This is closely connected to the human-prior-based identification approaches in Section 4.1 as those human-priors can often be used to re-formulate the training objective with additional regularizers. To achieve this goal, one usually needs to first construct a side component to inform the main model about the misaligned features, and then to regularize the main model according to the side component. The construction of this side component usually relies on prior knowledge of what the misaligned features are. Then, methods can be built accordingly to counter the features such as label-associated keywords (He et al., 2019), label-associated text fragments (Mahabadi et al., 2020), and general easy-to-learn patterns of data (Nam et al., 2020). Similarly, Clark et al. (2019Utama et al. (2020a,b) propose to ensemble with a model explicitly capturing bias, where the main model is trained together with this ""bias-only"" model such that the main model is discouraged from using biases. More recent work (Xiong et al., 2021) shows the ensemble-based approaches can be further improved via better calibrating the bias-only model. Furthermore, additional regularizers have been introduced for robust fine-tuning over pre-trained models, e.g., mutual-information-based regularizers (Wang et al., 2021a) and smoothness-inducing adversarial regularization (Jiang et al., 2020).

In a broader scope, given that one of the main challenges of domain adaptation is to counter the model's tendency in learning domain-specific spurious features (Ganin et al., 2016), some methods contributing to domain adaption may have also progressed along the line of our interest, e.g., domain adversarial neural network (Ganin et al., 2016).

Tu et al. (2020) showed a few other factors can also contribute to robust accuracy, including larger model size, more fine-tuning data, and longer fine-tuning. A similar observation is made by Taori et al. (2020) in the vision domain, where the authors found training with larger and more diverse datasets offer better robustness consistently in multiple cases, compared to various robustness interventions proposed in the existing literature. In general, the training strategy with an emphasis on a subset of samples that are particularly hard for the model to learn is sometimes also referred to as group DRO (Sagawa et al., 2020a), as an extension of vanilla distributional robust optimization (DRO) (Ben-Tal et al., 2013;Duchi et al., 2021).

LSTM-Shuttle (Fu and Ma, 2018) proposes a bidirectional shuttling mechanism, which can jump multiple time steps both forward and backward, allowing the model to ignore unimportant information and recover lost information if needed. Structural information that naturally exists in sentences can also play a role in skimming. Structural Jump-LSTM (Hansen et al., 2019) can jump to the next word, next sub-sentence separator (a comma or colon), next sentence end symbols (a period, exclamation mark or question mark), or to the end of the text (i.e., stop reading).

In the era of Transformers, there have been works attempting to reduce computation by either skip tokens at higher layers or forward tokens to higher layers. The PoWER-BERT model (Goyal et al., 2020) reduces the number of tokens processed by each Transformer layer based on their attention scores. The number of tokens to be dropped, referred to as the ""schedule,"" is optimized by combining the sparsity of a soft mask layer with the original loss function. This results in an improved balance between accuracy and processing time. TR-BERT (Ye et al., 2021) uses a dynamic approach to determine which tokens to skip, using reinforcement learning to train the model with a reward system that prioritizes classifier confidence while also penalizing the number of tokens retained. In contrast to PoWER-BERT, TR-BERT passes the skipped tokens to the final layer rather than discarding them. The Length-Adaptive Transformer (LAT, Kim and Cho, 2021) utilizes LengthDrop to randomly skip tokens during pretraining, aiming to close the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning. The schedule for LAT is found through an evolutionary search algorithm. LTP ) trains a threshold for each Transformer layer, instead of following a predetermined schedule. It simply drops tokens with attention scores lower than the learned threshold. Transkimmer (Guan et al., 2022) incorporates a skim predictor module, consisting of a small MLP and Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, before each layer. This module outputs a mask to determine whether a token should be dropped, and a skim loss is used to optimize the ratio of skipped tokens to total tokens, promoting sparsity.

Computation Reduction Different from skipping, computation reduction applies a reduced computational workload for some time steps instead of skipping it completely. VCRNN (Jernite et al., 2017) explores a scheduler to decide which proportion of computation to use for each time step. Upon making the decision, only the corresponding proportion of the weight matrix will be used to update the hidden states while the rest part of the weight matrix will be masked out with zero.

Instead of using part of weights to update the hidden states, Skim-RNN (Seo et al., 2018) has a big RNN and a separate small RNN. At each time step, the model decides whether to read or skim based on hidden states from the last time step and the input token. If the model decides to skim, the small RNN will update only a fraction of the hid-den states. Otherwise, a regular full update will be conducted by the big RNN.

Dynamic Hierarchical RNN Different from the aforementioned two categories of skimming, dynamic hierarchical RNN can increase computation by calling the upper layer RNN when needed. HM-RNN (Chung et al., 2017) automatically discovers the hierarchical multi-scale structure in the data for a hierarchical RNN architecture. In addition to the update and copy operations as in Skip RNN (Campos et al., 2018), they add a flush operation which ejects the summarized representation of the current time step to the upper layer and reinitializes the states for the next time step.

In question answering, only a small portion of tokens are relevant and can be used to answer the question while the rest can be safely skimmed. Based on this observation, Focused Hierarchical RNN (Ke et al., 2018) aims to only pick up information that is relevant to the query for question answering. It applies a binary gate to control whether to update the upper layer of the RNN, based on the current hidden states of the lower-level RNN and the question embedding.","1.

Intuitively, skimming matches how human beings efficiently read text and extract information from it (Li et al., 2019). By em-phasizing the important information within a sequence and ignoring parts with little importance, skimming helps the model achieve faster inference speed and better capture long-term dependencies. The three categories of skimming are skipping and early stopping, computation reduction, and dynamic hierarchical RNN, corresponding with three motivations: to skip unimportant input, to allocate less computation to unimportant input, and to increase computation to important input only.

Skipping and Early Stopping Skipping and early stopping aim to improve efficiency for a long sequence by skipping some tokens or stopping reading early. LSTM-Jump (Yu et al., 2017) is a skipping mechanism to ignore irrelevant information for natural language understanding (NLU). At each step, the current states are used to compute a ""jumping softmax"", which decides how many steps to jump forward and whether to stop reading. LSTM-Jump employs policy gradient to train the model to make non-differentiable discrete jumping decisions. The reward is a binary function which rewards a correct prediction and penalizes an incorrect prediction of the label. Compared to a standard LSTM, LSTM-Jump achieves better accuracy with up to 6× speed-up. Skip RNN (Campos et al., 2018) introduces a binary gate to learn whether to skip a state update. If the gate decides to skip a time step, the hidden states will be directly copied without any update.

To stop reading early as needed, Rea-soNet (Shen et al., 2017) introduces a terminal state which decides whether to terminate early for machine reading comprehension on each time step at the token level. Jumper  first splits a paragraph to several sub-sentences and encodes them into sentence embeddings. They then apply early stopping at a sentence when the policy network decides to stop reading. Li et al. (2019) use eye-tracking devices and confirm that skipping and early stopping are common when humans read text. They propose Reading Inspired Model to mimic the behaviors of humans, which allows the model to decide whether to skip a single time step or stop reading early. Yu et al.

Ensemble-based Early Exit One drawback in confidence-based early exit is wasted computation. That is to say, if the confidence of an internal classifier does not satisfy the exit criterion, it will be disregarded. Ensemble-based early exit recycles these predictions and considers output from multiple internal classifiers to make better predictions. Based on the similarity between overfitting and overthinking, PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) borrows early stopping from model training. They first jointly train the internal classifiers with BERT by a weighted sum of cross-entropy losses that assigns larger weights for upper classifiers. For inference, the model exits when k consecutive internal classifiers make the same prediction. Other than improvement on performance and efficiency, they find that PABEE can improve adversarial robustness, which they attribute to the ensemble effect.  further introduce a diversity loss that encourages internal classifiers to have a diverse predicted probability distribution. They propose a voting mechanism to ensemble the internal classifiers by exiting early when a class has accumulated more votes than the threshold. Interestingly, LeeBERT (Zhu, 2021) adopts the opposite strategy: they promote consistency across internal classifiers by distilling them to each other. However, they introduce a learnable weight for the cross-entropy loss of each classifier and the distillation loss between each pair. They optimize these weights by a cross-level optimization algorithm.

They adopt PABEE's patience-based strategy for exiting. Liao et al. (2021) train linear transformation layers called ""imitation learners"", to approximate the hidden states of future layers based on current hidden states. For inference, the prediction after each layer is calculated by mixing the past predictions and the future predictions of the imitation learners. Entropy is used as the exit criterion. PCEE-BERT (Zhang et al., 2022a) borrows from both ensemble-based exit and confidencebased methods. The inference is terminated when multiple layers are confident.

Learning-based Early Exit Another stream of research is to learn a criterion for early exiting.

BERxiT (Xin et al., 2021) alternates between joint fine-tuning and two-stage fine-tuning by freezing parameters of Transformer and the final classifier for even-numbered iterations and unfreezing them for odd-numbered iterations. They also train a linear layer called a learning-to-exit (LTE) module to predict whether the current internal classifier makes the correct prediction. It takes the hidden states as input and outputs a confidence score, which is used to decide whether to exit. CAT (Schuster et al., 2021) introduces a ""meta consistency classifier"" to predict whether the output of an internal classifier conforms to the final classifier and exits when the consistency classifier predicts a certain level of conformity.

Cascading Cascading can be seen as a special form of early exit, performed at the model level. Li et al. (2021a) find that shallow features and internal classifiers in the first few layers of BERT utilized by early exit methods like DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) are not sufficient and reliable, underperforming a fine-tuned BERT with the same number of layers. Therefore, they propose to use a suite of complete models with different numbers of layers for cascading. CascadeBERT executes models one by one, from the smallest to the largest. It stops when a model outputs a confidence score (calibrated maximum class probability) that reaches the threshold.

Applications Although early exit is originally developed for classification, there have been works extending it to more tasks and settings. Li et al. (2021b) propose Token-Level Early-Exit that targets early exiting for sequence labeling. They use the maximum class probability as confidence on a per-token basis. Once the confidence hits the threshold, the hidden states of the corresponding tokens will be frozen and directly copied to upper layers. These exited tokens will not attend to other tokens at upper layers but can still be attended by other tokens. The model completely exits when every token exits. A similar idea is also presented in Elbayad et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2021b) where hidden states of some positions can be frozen and directly copied to upper layers, although the former is focused on generation and the latter is for classification. Xin et al. (2020a) apply DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) to document ranking and set different thresholds to the negative and positive classes for early exiting, to accommodate the imbalanced class distribution in document ranking. ELUE (Liu et al., 2021a) is a benchmark which evaluates the Pareto Front of early exit models on the FLOPs-performance plane. They provide a BERT-like baseline with jointly pretrained internal classifiers, to mitigate the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning.","1.

An agent in the environment has access to first-person view RGB images, together with semantic/instance masks and depth information.

Matterport3D (Anderson et al., 2018b) simulator is a large-scale visual reinforcement learning simulation environment for research on embodied AI based on the Matterport3D dataset (Chang et al., 2017). Matterport3D contains various indoor scenes, including houses, apartments, hotels, offices, and churches. An agent can navigate between viewpoints along a pre-defined graph. Most indoors VLN datasets such as R2R and its variants are based on the Matterport3D simulator.

Habitat ( where agents could navigate and interact with objects. Based on the object interaction function, it helps to build a dataset that requires object interaction, such as ALFRED (Shridhar et al., 2020).

Gibson (Xia et al., 2018) is a real-world perception interactive environment with complex semantics. Each viewpoint has a set of RGB panoramas with global camera poses and reconstructed 3D meshes. Matterport3D dataset (Chang et al., 2017) is also integrated into the Gibson simulator.

House3D (Wu et al., 2018) converts SUNCG's static environment into a virtual environment, where the agent can navigate with physical constraints (e.g. it cannot pass through walls or objects).

LANI (Misra et al., 2018) is a 3D simulator built in Unity3D platform. The environment in LANI is a fenced, square, grass field containing randomly placed landmarks. An agent needs to navigate between landmarks following the natural language instruction. Drone navigation tasks (Blukis et al., 2018(Blukis et al., , 2019 are also built based on LANI.

248426721,What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? A Survey on Datasets and Study on Scientific Relation Classification,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29a369d83a7d6a49f6a3259bee23bd4d95db0b16,Relation Extraction Datasets Survey,22,"RE has been broadly studied in the last decades and many datasets were published. We survey widely used RE datasets in chronological order, and broadly classify them into three domains based on the data source: (1) news and web, (2) scientific publications and (3) Wikipedia. An overview of the datasets is given in Table 1. Our empirical target here focuses on the scientific domain as so far it has received no attention in the cross-domain direction; a similar investigation on overlaps in data, annotation, and model transferability between datasets in other domains is interesting future work. The CoNLL 2004 dataset (Roth and Yih, 2004) is one of the first works. It contains annotations for named entities and relations in news articles. In the same year, the widely studied ACE dataset was published by Doddington et al. (2004). It contains annotated entities, relations and events in broadcast transcripts, newswire and newspaper data in English, Chinese and Arabic. The corpus is divided into six domains.

Another widely used dataset is The New York Times (NYT) Annotated Corpus, 3 first presented by Riedel et al. (2010). It contains over 1.8 million articles by the NYT between 1987 and 2007. NYT has been created with a distant supervision approach (Mintz et al., 2009), using Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008 as knowledge base. Two further versions of it followed recently: Zhu et al. (2020b) (NYT-H) and Jia et al. (2019) published manually annotated versions of the test set in order to perform a more accurate evaluation.

3 http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/ RE has also been part of the SemEval shared tasks for four times so far. The two early Se-mEval shared tasks focused on the identification of semantic relations between nominals (Nastase et al., 2021). For SemEval-2007Task 4, Girju et al. (2007 released a dataset for RC into seven generic semantic relations between nominals. Three years later, for SemEval-2010 Task 8, Hendrickx et al. (2010) revised the annotation guidelines and published a corpus for RC, by providing a much larger dataset (10k instances, in comparison to 1.5k of the 2007 shared task).

Since 2017, three RE datasets in the scientific domain emerged, two of the three as SemEval shared tasks. In SemEval-2017 Task 10 Augenstein et al. (2017) proposed a dataset for the identification of keyphrases and considered two generic relations (HYPONYM-OF and SYNONYM-OF). The dataset is called ScienceIE and consists of 500 journal articles from the Computer Science, Material Sciences and Physics fields. The year after, Gábor et al. (2018) proposed a corpus for RC and RE made of abstracts of scientific papers from the ACL Anthology for SemEval-2018 Task 7. The data will be described in further detail in Section 4.1. Following the same line, Luan et al. (2018) published SCIERC, which is a scientific RE dataset further annotated for coreference resolution. It contains abstracts from scientific AI-related conferences. From the existing three scientific RE datasets summarized in Table 1, in our empirical investigation we focus on two (SemEval-2018 and SCIERC). We leave out ScienceIE as it focuses on keyphrase extraction and it contains two generic relations only.

The Wikipedia domain has been first introduced in 2013. Google released GoogleRE, 4 a RE corpus consisting of snippets from Wikipedia. More recently, Kassner et al. (2021) proposed mLAMA, a multilingual version (53 languages) of GoogleRE with the purpose of investigating knowledge in pretrained language models. The multi-lingual dimension is gaining more interest for RE. Following this trend, Seganti et al. (2021) presented SMiLER, a multilingual dataset (14 languages) from Wikipedia with relations belonging to nine domains.

Previous datasets were restricted to the same label collection in the training set and in the test set. To address this gap and make RE experimental scenarios more realistic, Han et al. (2018) -2007- Girju et al. (2007 Sentences from the web 7 SemEval-2010 Hendrickx et al. (2010) Sentences from the web 10 TACRED Zhang et al. (2017b) Newswire and web text 42 FSL TACRED Sabo et al. (2021) TACRED   Back to the news domain, Zhang et al. (2017b) published a large-scale RE dataset built over newswire and web text, by crowdsourcing relation annotations for sentences with named entity pairs. This resulted in the TACRED dataset with over 100k instances, which is particularly well-suited for neural models. Sabo et al. (2021) used TA-CRED to make a FSL RC dataset and compared it to FewRel 1.0 and FewRel 2.0, aiming at a more realistic scenario (i.e., non-uniform label distribution, inclusion of pronouns and common nouns).

All datasets so far present a sentence level annotation. To address this, Yao et al. (2019) published DocRED, a document-level RE dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata. The difference with a traditional sentence-level corpus is that both the intraand inter-sentence relations are annotated, increasing the challenge level. In addition to RE, DocRED annotates coreference chains. DWIE by Zaporojets et al. (2021) is another document-level dataset, specifically designed for multi-task IE (Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Relation Extraction, and Entity Linking).

Lastly, there are works focusing on creating datasets for specific RE aspects. Cheng et al. (2021), for example, proposed a Chinese documentlevel RE dataset for hard cases in order to move towards even more challenging evaluation setups.

Domains in RE Given our analysis, we observe a shift in target domains: from news text in seminal works, over web texts, to emerging corpora in the scientific domain and the most recent focus on Wikipedia. Similarly, we observe the emerging trend for FSL.

Different datasets lend themselves to study different aspects of the task. Concerning crossdomain RE, we propose to distinguish three setups:

1. Data from different domains, but same relation types, which are general enough to be present in each domain (limited and often confined to the ACE dataset) (e.g., Plank and Moschitti, 2013).

In the case study of this paper, given the scientific datasets available, we focus on the first setup.","1. RE has been broadly studied in the last decades and many datasets were published.
2. We survey widely used RE datasets in chronological order, and broadly classify them into three domains based on the data source: (1) news and web, (2) scientific publications and (3) Wikipedia.

6. It contains annotations for named entities and relations in news articles.
7. In the same year, the widely studied ACE dataset was published by Doddington et al. (2004).
8. It contains annotated entities, relations and events in broadcast transcripts, newswire and newspaper data in English, Chinese and Arabic.
9. The corpus is divided into six domains.
10. Another widely used dataset is The New York Times (NYT) Annotated Corpus, 3 first presented by Riedel et al. (2010).
11. It contains over 1.8 million articles by the NYT between 1987 and 2007.
12. NYT has been created with a distant supervision approach (Mintz et al., 2009), using Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008 as knowledge base. Two further versions of it followed recently: Zhu et al. (2020b) (NYT-H) and Jia et al. (2019) published manually annotated versions of the test set in order to perform a more accurate evaluation.
13. 3 http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/ RE has also been part of the SemEval shared tasks for four times so far.
14. The two early Se-mEval shared tasks focused on the identification of semantic relations between nominals (Nastase et al., 2021).
15. For SemEval-2007Task 4, Girju et al. (2007 released a dataset for RC into seven generic semantic relations between nominals.
16. Three years later, for SemEval-2010 Task 8, Hendrickx et al. (2010) revised the annotation guidelines and published a corpus for RC, by providing a much larger dataset (10k instances, in comparison to 1.5k of the 2007 shared task).Since 2017, three RE datasets in the scientific domain emerged, two of the three as SemEval shared tasks.
17. In SemEval-2017 Task 10 Augenstein et al. (2017) proposed a dataset for the identification of keyphrases and considered two generic relations (HYPONYM-OF and SYNONYM-OF).
18. The dataset is called ScienceIE and consists of 500 journal articles from the Computer Science, Material Sciences and Physics fields.
19. The year after, Gábor et al. (2018) proposed a corpus for RC and RE made of abstracts of scientific papers from the ACL Anthology for SemEval-2018 Task 7.
20. The data will be described in further detail in Section 4.1.
21. Following the same line, Luan et al. (2018) published SCIERC, which is a scientific RE dataset further annotated for coreference resolution.
22. It contains abstracts from scientific AI-related conferences.
23. From the existing three scientific RE datasets summarized in Table 1, in our empirical investigation we focus on two (SemEval-2018 and SCIERC).
24. We leave out ScienceIE as it focuses on keyphrase extraction and it contains two generic relations only.
25. The Wikipedia domain has been first introduced in 2013.
26. Google released GoogleRE, 4 a RE corpus consisting of snippets from Wikipedia.
27. More recently, Kassner et al. (2021) proposed mLAMA, a multilingual version (53 languages) of GoogleRE with the purpose of investigating knowledge in pretrained language models.
28. The multi-lingual dimension is gaining more interest for RE.
29. Following this trend, Seganti et al. (2021) presented SMiLER, a multilingual dataset (14 languages) from Wikipedia with relations belonging to nine domains.
30. Previous datasets were restricted to the same label collection in the training set and in the test set.
31. To address this gap and make RE experimental scenarios more realistic,
32. Han et al. (2018) -2007- Girju et al. (2007 Sentences from the web 7 SemEval-2010 Hendrickx et al. (2010) Sentences from the web 10 TACRED Zhang et al. (2017b) Newswire and web text 42 FSL TACRED Sabo et al. (2021) TACRED   Back to the news domain, Zhang et al. (2017b) published a large-scale RE dataset built over newswire and web text, by crowdsourcing relation annotations for sentences with named entity pairs.
33. This resulted in the TACRED dataset with over 100k instances, which is particularly well-suited for neural models.
34. Sabo et al. (2021) used TA-CRED to make a FSL RC dataset and compared it to FewRel 1.0 and FewRel 2.0, aiming at a more realistic scenario (i.e., non-uniform label distribution, inclusion of pronouns and common nouns).
35. All datasets so far present a sentence level annotation.
36. To address this, Yao et al. (2019) published DocRED, a document-level RE dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata.
37. The difference with a traditional sentence-level corpus is that both the intraand inter-sentence relations are annotated, increasing the challenge level.
38. In addition to RE, DocRED annotates coreference chains.
39. DWIE by Zaporojets et al. (2021) is another document-level dataset, specifically designed for multi-task IE (Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Relation Extraction, and Entity Linking).
40. Lastly, there are works focusing on creating datasets for specific RE aspects.
41. Cheng et al. (2021), for example, proposed a Chinese documentlevel RE dataset for hard cases in order to move towards even more challenging evaluation setups.
42. Domains in RE Given our analysis, we observe a shift in target domains: from news text in seminal works, over web texts, to emerging corpora in the scientific domain and the most recent focus on Wikipedia.
43. Similarly, we observe the emerging trend for FSL.
44. Different datasets lend themselves to study different aspects of the task.
45. Concerning crossdomain RE, we propose to distinguish three setups:1.
46. Data from different domains, but same relation types, which are general enough to be present in each domain (limited and often confined to the ACE dataset) (e.g., Plank and Moschitti, 2013).

248426721,What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? A Survey on Datasets and Study on Scientific Relation Classification,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29a369d83a7d6a49f6a3259bee23bd4d95db0b16,The Relation Extraction Task,11,"Conceptually, RE involves a pipeline of steps (see Figure 2). Starting from the raw text, the first step consists in identifying the entities and eventually assigning them a type. Entities involve either nominals or named entities, and hence it is either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or, more broadly, Mention Detection (MD). 5 After entities are identified, approaches start to be more blurry as studies have approached RE via different angles.

One way is to take two steps, Relation Identification (RI) and subsequent Relation Classification (RC) , as illustrated in Figure 2. This means to first identify from all the possible entity pairs the ones which are in some kind of relation via a binary classification task (RI). As the proportion of positive samples over the negative is usually extremely unbalanced towards the latter (Gormley et al., 2015), a priori heuristics are generally applied to reduce the possible combinations (e.g., entity pairs involving distant entities, or entity type pairs not licensed by the relations are not even considered). The last step (RC) is usually a multi-class classification to assign a relation type r to the positive samples from the previous step. Some studies merge RI and RC (Seganti et al., 2021) into one step, by adding a no-relation (no-rel) label. Other studies instead reduce the task to RC, and assume there exists a relation between two entities and the task is to determine the type (without a no-rel label). Regardless, RI is influenced by the RC setup: Relations which are not in the RC label set are considered as negative samples in the RI phase. Some studies address this approximation by distinguishing between the no-rel and the None-Of-The-Above (NOTA) relation (Gao et al., 2019). Note that, in our definition, the NOTA label differs from no-rel in the sense that a relation holds between the two entities, but its type is not in the considered RC label set. 6 What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? RE studies rarely address the whole pipeline. We 5 Some studies divide the entity extraction into two substeps: identification (often called MD), and subsequent classification into entity types. 6 Some studies name such relation Other (Hendrickx et al., 2010). analyze all the ACL papers published in the last five years which contain the Relation Extraction keyword in the title and determine which sub-task is performed (NER/MD, RI, RC). Table 2 shows such investigation. We leave out from this analysis (a) papers which make use of distant supervision or which somehow involve knowledge bases, (b) shared task papers, (c) the bioNLP field, (d) temporal RE, and (e) Open RE. The result shows that gold entities are usually assumed for RE, presumably given the complexity of the NER/MD task on its own. Most importantly, for end-to-end models, recent work has shown that ablations for steps like NER are lacking (Taillé et al., 2020). Our analysis further shows that it is difficult to determine the RI setup. While RC is always performed, the situation is different for RI (or no-rel). Sometimes RI is clearly not done (i.e., the paper assumes a scenario in which every instance contains at least one relation), but most of the times it is either not clear from the paper, or done in a simplified scenario (e.g., datasets which already clear out most of the no-rel entity pair instances). As this blurriness hampers fair evaluation, we propose that studies clearly state which step they include, i.e., whether the work focus is on RC, RI+RC or the full RE pipeline and how special cases (no-rel and NOTA) are handled. These details are utterly important as they impact both model estimation and evaluation.

Pipeline or Joint Model? The traditional RE pipeline is, by definition of pipeline, prone to error propagation by sub-tasks. Joint entity and relation extraction approaches have been proposed in order to alleviate this problem (Miwa and Bansal, 2016;Zhang et al., 2017a;Bekoulis et al., 2018a,b;Wang and Lu, 2020;Wang et al., 2021). However, Taillé et al. (2020) recently discussed the challenge of properly evaluating such complex models. They surveyed the evaluation metrics of recently published works on end-to-end RE referring to the Strict, Boundaries, Relaxed evaluation setting pro-  posed by Bekoulis et al. (2018a). They observe unfair comparisons and overestimations of end-toend models, and claim the need for more rigorous reports of evaluation settings, including detailed datasets statistics. While some recent work shifts to joint models, it is still an open question which approach (joint or pipeline) is the most robust. Zhong and Chen (2021) found that when incorporating modern pretrained language models (e.g., BERT) using separate encoders can surpass existing joint models. Since the output label space is different, separate encoders could better capture distinct contextual information. At the moment it is not clear if one approach is more suitable than the other for RE. For this reason and because of our final goal, which is a closer look to sub-domains in the scientific field, we follow the pipeline approach and, following most work from Table 2, we here restrict the setup by focusing on the RC task.","1.

sent28: Joint entity and relation extraction approaches have been proposed in order to alleviate this problem (Miwa and Bansal, 2016;Zhang et al., 2017a;Bekoulis et al., 2018a,b;Wang and Lu, 2020;Wang et al., 2021).
sent29: However, Taillé et al. (2020) recently discussed the challenge of properly evaluating such complex models.
sent30: They surveyed the evaluation metrics of recently published works on end-to-end RE referring to the Strict, Boundaries, Relaxed evaluation setting pro-  posed by Bekoulis et al. (2018a).
sent31: They observe unfair comparisons and overestimations of end-toend models, and claim the need for more rigorous reports of evaluation settings, including detailed datasets statistics.
sent32: While some recent work shifts to joint models, it is still an open question which approach (joint or pipeline) is the most robust.
sent33: Zhong and Chen (2021) found that when incorporating modern pretrained language models (e.g., BERT) using separate encoders can surpass existing joint models.
sent34: Since the output label space is different, separate encoders could better capture distinct contextual information.
sent35: At the moment it is not clear if one approach is more suitable than the other for RE.
sent36: For this reason and because of our final goal, which is a closer look to sub-domains in the scientific field, we follow the pipeline approach and, following most work from Table 2, we here restrict the setup by focusing on the RC task.","1.

251402499,Abstractive Meeting Summarization: A Survey,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6dd2ffed96ab44004b2e4cb1bf36a44daae14d42,Evaluation methods,8,"As noted in Section 2, the subjectivity of meeting summaries, stemming in part from the preference for abstractive summarization, complicates the evaluation task. Evaluation requires both verifying that the content in a system-based summary follows from the original transcript and measuring the overlap with a gold-standard summary. However, given the expressive freedom encouraged by abstractive approaches, checking for semantic entailment and overlap of summary-worthy content requires deep semantic understanding, not just recognition that the same words are used.

Unfortunately, the ROUGE metric (Lin, 2004), which remains the standard for both meeting and general text summarization, scores systemproduced summaries based purely on surface lexicographic matches with a (usually single) gold summary, making it unideal for assessing abstractive summaries. If we take the abstractive summary from Figure 1 (""Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material"") as a gold example, ROUGE would assign a higher score to a system that produces ""Some part of the casing will be made of broccoli"" than one that output ""A portion of the outer layer will be constructed from a sponge-like material,"" even though the latter is a perfect reformulation of the gold summary, while the former says something very different (and false).

A reasonable way to try to improve over ROUGE would be to take advantage of massive, pretrained, contextual word embeddings and a notion of lexical similarity rather than strict lexical overlap. Some recent efforts pursue this direction (Sai et al., 2022), including BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020a) and MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019a), which aim to measure the semantic distance between the contextualized mapping of a generated summary and the reference, or BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021), which calculates the log-likelihood of a summary to have been generated, motivated by the fact that a good summary should have a high probability of being generated from a source text. Building upon these methods, DATScore and FrugalScore (Eddine et al., 2022;Kamal Eddine et al., 2022) incorporate data augmentation and knowledge distillation techniques to further improve performance and overcome their drawbacks.

Despite their rapid development, recent studies on meta-evaluation of these metrics show mixed results. Peyrard (2019) and Bhandari et al. (2020a) compare their performance in the context of document summarization and show that metrics strongly disagree in ranking summaries from any narrow scoring range, e.g., there is no consensus among metrics regarding which summary is better than another in the high scoring range in which modern systems now operate. Bhandari et al. (2020b) argue that there is no one-size-fitsall metric that correlates better with human judgement than the others, and that can outperform others on all datasets.

Clearly, evaluation is itself a very challenging task. And we note that none of these metrics even touches on another central challenge for summary evaluation, namely that of factual consistency. When we summarize a meeting or detail decisions and actions items in our own words, it is important to get the facts straight. Otherwise, the resulting summaries are not reliable for an end user. While we do not know of current work that focuses on evaluation of factuality explicitly for the meeting domain, the study of factual consistency in summarization more generally is a budding research area that we discuss in Section 6.

In the absence of a clear winner for summary evaluation metrics, none of the alternatives has yet to be widely adopted. In our comparison of different summarization systems in Section 5, we therefore stick with ROUGE, which offers the additional advantage of conceptual simplicity and lower computational cost compared to metrics based on contextual embeddings and pretrained language models.","1.

Drawing on similar insights, certain recent approaches exploit independent theories of discourse structure, such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; Mann and Thompson, 1987) and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT; Asher, 1993;Lascarides and Asher, 2008), to improve summarization. Accounts like RST and SDRT maintain that in a coherent conversation, each (roughly) clause-level unit should be semantically related to some other part of the conversation via a discourse relation such as Question-Answer Pair (QAP), Acknowledgement (Ack), Explanation, Contrast, etc. to reflect its contribution to the larger discourse.

To the best of our knowledge, Feng et al. (2020) is the first work to exploit discourse graphs to generate abstractive meeting summaries. They employ a sequential discourse parser (Shi and Huang, 2019) trained on the STAC corpus of multi-party chats (Asher et al., 2016) to automatically obtain discourse graphs for the AMI and ICSI meeting corpora. Levi graph transformation (Gross and Yellen, 2003) is then used to turn graph edges labeled with discourse relation types into vertices. Their graph-to-sequence model consists of a graph convolutional network encoder (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) that takes a meeting discourse graph as input and a PGN decoder (See et al., 2017) to generate the final summary. A dialogue-aware data augmentation strategy for constructing pseudo-summaries is introduced to pretrain the model.

An alternative approach to discourse interpretation that developed largely independently of RST and SDRT is dialogue act classification. Detailing the differences between the approaches is out of the scope of this paper, but in a nutshell, dialogue acts provide a shallower notion of discourse structure (Jurafsky et al., 1997) in that they do not entail a full graph structure over a conversation. On the other hand, systems for dialogue act labeling, such as DAMSL (Allen and Core, 1997; Core and Allen, 1997) or DiAML (Bunt et al., 2010(Bunt et al., , 2012, place more emphasis on interactive acts such as stalling to hold the floor, assessing other discourse moves, suggesting or informing.

Both the AMI and ICSI corpora provide gold dialogue act labels, and Goo and Chen (2018) use the labels from the AMI corpus to develop a sentence-gated mechanism that jointly models the relationships between dialogue acts and topic summaries to improve abstractive meeting summarization. In particular, they show that dialogue acts of the type inform are more closely linked to summary-worthy material than acts such as stall or assess. Using LSTM, their model consists of three components enhanced with various attention mechanisms: an utterance encoder, a dialogue act labeler, and a summary decoder.

Dialogue acts have also been used to good effect for summarizing decisions. Fernández et al. (2008) and Bui et al. (2009) first identify relevant areas of decision-related discussion in meetings and classify them as decision-related dialogue acts including the issue under discussion, its resolution, or agreement with the proposed resolution.

251402499,Abstractive Meeting Summarization: A Survey,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6dd2ffed96ab44004b2e4cb1bf36a44daae14d42,Multimodality,6,"Meetings tend to take place in shared visual contexts, allowing important information to be conveyed through gestures, facial expressions, head poses, eye gaze, and so on. It is thus reasonable to think that harnessing this information could lead to improved performance over a summarization system that draws on speech transcripts alone. Indeed, Li et al. (2019) has shown that the Visual Focus Of Attention (VFOA), which is estimated based on a participant's head orientation and eye gaze, can help a multi-modal summarization system determine salient utterances, thereby improving the quality of abstractive meeting summaries. In this work, VFOA is integrated with attention mechanisms in a PGN text decoder and topic segmenter trained in a multi-task learning setting.

In the context of extractive meeting summarization, Erol et al. (2003) exploits multimodality to select segments of meeting video recordings in order to facilitate browsing of the videos for important information. Along with TF-IDF text analysis of the speech transcript, their system attends to certain visual motion activities (e.g., someone entering the meeting room or standing up to make a presentation) and to acoustic features (e.g., speech volume and degree of interaction) to enhance detection of summary-worthy events. Similar ideas can be found in Xie and Liu (2010);Nihei et al. (2016Nihei et al. ( , 2018; Nihei and Nakano (2019).

Of course, enhancing meeting transcripts with information to improve interpretation comes at a cost: most annotations are performed manually and require linguistic expertise to do well, and annotations produced automatically, as in Shi and Huang (2019) or Shang et al. (2020b), can add uncertainties to the data. It is perhaps thus unsurprising that the last couple of years have seen a shift away from Interpretation-focused methods presented in this section towards Generation methods, as shown in Table 1. Still, certain approaches showed promising results, especially Feng et al.

(2020) and Li et al. (2019), and arguably, Interpretation approaches offer other advantages that should encourage us to explore them further. Discourse graphs, for example, can provide input to graph-based networks, helping to bypass limits on input document length imposed by some Generation approaches (see Section 5.3).

As summarized in § 2, datasets prior to Spider typically involve simple DBs that contain only one table or a single DB in both training and testing. As a result, modeling DB schema receives little attention. Because Spider contains complex and different DB in training and testing, Bogin et al. (2019a) propose to use graphs to represent the structure of the DB schemas. Specifically, Bogin et al. (2019a) use nodes to represent tables and columns, edges to represent relationships between tables and columns, such as tables containing columns, primary key, and foreign key constraints, and then use graph neural networks (GNNs) (Li et al., 2016) to encode the graph structure. In their subsequent work, Bogin et al. (2019b) use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture DB structures and a gated GCN to select the relevant DB information for SQL generation. RAT-SQL  encodes more relationships for DB schemas such as ""both columns are from the same table"" in their graph.

Graphs have also been used to encode questions together with DB schema. Researchers have been using different types of graphs to capture the semantics in NL and facilitate linking between NL and table schema. Cao et al. (2021) adopt line graph (Gross et al., 2018) to capture multi-hop semantics by meta-path (e.g., an exact match for a question token and column, together with the column belonging to a table can form a 2-hop meta-path) and distinguish between local and nonlocal neighbors so that different tables and columns will be attended differently. SADGA (Cai et al., 2021) adopts the graph structure to provide a unified encoding for both natural utterances and DB schemas to help question-schema linking. Apart from the relations between entities in both questions and DB schema, the structure for DB schemas, S 2 SQL (Hui et al., 2022) integrates syntax dependency among question tokens into the graph to improve model performance. To improve the generalization of the graph method for unseen domains, ShawdowGNN (Chen et al., 2021b) ignores names of tables or columns in the database and uses abstract schemas in the graph projection neural network to obtain delexicalized representations of questions and DB schemas.

Finally, graph-based techniques are also exploited in context-dependent text-to-SQL. For instance, IGSQL (Cai and Wan, 2020) uses a graph encoder to utilize historical information of DB schemas in the previous turns.

Self-attention Models using transformer-based encoder (He et al., 2019;Xie et al., 2022) incorporate the original self-attention mechanism by default because it is the building block of the transformer structure.

RAT-SQL  applies relationaware self-attention, a modified version of selfattention (Vaswani et al., 2017), to leverage relations of tables and columns. DuoRAT (Scholak et al., 2021a) also adopts such a relation-aware self-attention in their encoder.

Adapt PLM Various methods have been proposed to leverage the knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs) and better align PLM with the text-to-SQL task. PLMs such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) are used to encode questions and DB schemas. The modus operandi is to input the concatenation of question words and schema words to the BERT encoder Choi et al., 2021). Other methods adjust the embeddings by PLMs. On WikiSQL, for instance, X-SQL (He et al., 2019) replaces segment embeddings from the pre-trained encoder by column type embeddings. Guo and Gao (2019) encode two additional feature vectors for matching between question tokens and table cells as well as column names and concatenate them with BERT embeddings of questions and DB schemas.

HydraNet  uses BERT to encode the question and an individual column, aligning with the tasks BERT is pre-trained on. After obtaining the BERT representations of all columns, Lyu et al. (2020) select top-ranked columns for SQL prediction. Liu et al. (2021b) train an auxiliary concept prediction module to predict which tables and columns correspond to the question. They detect important question tokens by detecting the largest drop in the confidence score caused by erasing that token in the question. Lastly, they train the PLM with a grounding module using the question tokens and the corresponding tables as well as columns. By empirical studies, Liu et al. (2021b) claim that their approach can awaken the latent grounding from PLM via this erase-andpredict technique.

Pre-training There have been various works proposing different pre-training objectives and using different pre-training data to better align the transformer-based encoder with the text-to-SQL task. For instance, TaBERT  uses tabular data for pre-training with objectives of masked column prediction and cell value recovery to pre-train BERT. Grappa  synthesizes question-SQL pairs over tables and pre-trains BERT with the objectives of masked language modeling (MLM) and predicting whether a column appears in the SQL query as well as what SQL operations are triggered. GAP (Shi et al., 2020a) pre-trains BART (Lewis et al., 2020) on synthesized text-to-SQL and tabular data with the objectives of MLM, column prediction, column recovery, and SQL generation.","1.

sent6: In their subsequent work, Bogin et al. (2019b) use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture DB structures and a gated GCN to select the relevant DB information for SQL generation.
sent7: RAT-SQL  encodes more relationships for DB schemas such as ""both columns are from the same table"" in their graph.
sent8: Graphs have also been used to encode questions together with DB schema.
sent9: Researchers have been using different types of graphs to capture the semantics in NL and facilitate linking between NL and table schema.
sent10: Cao et al. (2021) adopt line graph (Gross et al., 2018) to capture multi-hop semantics by meta-path (e.g., an exact match for a question token and column, together with the column belonging to a table can form a 2-hop meta-path) and distinguish between local and nonlocal neighbors so that different tables and columns will be attended differently.
sent11: SADGA (Cai et al., 2021) adopts the graph structure to provide a unified encoding for both natural utterances and DB schemas to help question-schema linking.
sent12: Apart from the relations between entities in both questions and DB schema, the structure for DB schemas, S 2 SQL (Hui et al., 2022) integrates syntax dependency among question tokens into the graph to improve model performance.
sent13: To improve the generalization of the graph method for unseen domains, ShawdowGNN (Chen et al., 2021b) ignores names of tables or columns in the database and uses abstract schemas in the graph projection neural network to obtain delexicalized representations of questions and DB schemas.
sent14: Finally, graph-based techniques are also exploited in context-dependent text-to-SQL.
sent15: For instance, IGSQL (Cai and Wan, 2020) uses a graph encoder to utilize historical information of DB schemas in the previous turns.
sent16: Self-attention Models using transformer-based encoder (He et al., 2019;Xie et al., 2022) incorporate the original self-attention mechanism by default because it is the building block of the transformer structure.
sent17: RAT-SQL  applies relationaware self-attention, a modified version of selfattention (Vaswani et al., 2017), to leverage relations of tables and columns.
sent18: DuoRAT (Scholak et al., 2021a) also adopts such a relation-aware self-attention in their encoder.
sent19: Adapt PLM Various methods have been proposed to leverage the knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs) and better align PLM with the text-to-SQL task.
sent20: PLMs such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) are used to encode questions and DB schemas.
sent21: The modus operandi is to input the concatenation of question words and schema words to the BERT encoder Choi et al., 2021).
sent22: Other methods adjust the embeddings by PLMs.
sent23: On WikiSQL, for instance, X-SQL (He et al., 2019) replaces segment embeddings from the pre-trained encoder by column type embeddings.
sent24: Guo and Gao (2019) encode two additional feature vectors for matching between question tokens and table cells as well as column names and concatenate them with BERT embeddings of questions and DB schemas.
sent25: HydraNet  uses BERT to encode the question and an individual column, aligning with the tasks BERT is pre-trained on.
sent26: After obtaining the BERT representations of all columns, Lyu et al. (2020) select top-ranked columns for SQL prediction.
sent27: Liu et al. (2021b) train an auxiliary concept prediction module to predict which tables and columns correspond to the question.
sent28: They detect important question tokens by detecting the largest drop in the confidence score caused by erasing that token in the question.
sent29: Lastly, they train the PLM with a grounding module using the question tokens and the corresponding tables as well as columns.
sent30: By empirical studies, Liu et al. (2021b) claim that their approach can awaken the latent grounding from PLM via this erase-andpredict technique.
sent31: Pre-training There have been various works proposing different pre-training objectives and using different pre-training data to better align the transformer-based encoder with the text-to-SQL task.
sent32: For instance, TaBERT  uses tabular data for pre-training with objectives of masked column prediction and cell value recovery to pre-train BERT.
sent33: Grappa  synthesizes question-SQL pairs over tables and pre-trains BERT with the objectives of masked language modeling (MLM) and predicting whether a column appears in the SQL query as well as what SQL operations are triggered.
sent34: GAP (Shi et al., 2020a) pre-trains BART (Lewis et al., 2020) on synthesized text-to-SQL and tabular data with the objectives of MLM, column prediction, column recovery, and SQL generation.","1. Why are graph-based methods used in text-to-SQL tasks? sent1

Recently we have witnessed great improvements in sarcasm processing and in this part we will discuss how new tasks in sarcasm could motivate irony research.

Data Collection As discussed, datasets are highly dependent on hashtags as a signal to extract ironical expressions. Shmueli et al. (2020) proposed an algorithm to detect sarcastic tweets from a thread based on exterior cue tweets. A distant supervision based method for extracting ironies from platforms is crucial, given ironies in conversational contexts are central topic in the future.

Intended and Perceived Irony Oprea and Magdy (2019) explored how author profiling affected the perceived sarcasm (manual labelling) versus the intended sarcasm (hashtags), and verified the difference between both. Further, Oprea and Magdy (2020) introduced iSarcasm dataset which divided intended sarcasms and perceived sarcasms. The state-of-the-art sarcasm detection models performed obviously worse than human evaluation on this dataset. Future work could focus on multimodal perceived and intended irony, especially across various cultures.

Target Identification Sarcasm target identification was firstly proposed in Joshi et al. (2018), in which sarcasm targets were classified as one target, several targets and outside. Patro et al. (2019) introduced sociolinguistic features and a deep learning framework, and improved target identification by a lot. For irony processing, most ironical expressions do not equip a specific target in itself as previously discussed. However, its ironical effects are likely in dialogue or visually grounded environment, which encourages us to enhance irony datasets in aforementioned ways.

Irony Explanation Irony, according to the definition, have opposite real meanings to literal meanings. However, this does not mean adding a single negation could interpret ironies well. Kumar et al. (2022) proposed a new task, sarcasm explanation in dialogue. Irony explanation might encounter more complex problems due to relatively low proportion of targets.

One of the peculiarities of sarcasm is whether or not the speakers intend to offend the listeners. Kumon-Nakamura et al.

Question answering (QA) was found to be the most common NLP task using KGs. This task is typically divided into textual QA and question answering over knowledge bases (KBQA). Textual QA derives answers from unstructured documents while KBQA does so from predefined knowledge bases (Fu et al., 2020). KBQA is naturally tied to KGs while textual QA can also be approached by using KGs as a source of common-sense knowledge when answering questions. As Zhu et al. (2021) conclude, this approach is desired not only because it is helpful for generating answers, but also because it makes answers more interpretable.

Semantic search refers to ""search with meaning"", where the goal is not just to search for literal matches, but to understand the search intent and query context as well (Bast et al., 2016). This label denoted studies that use KGs for search, recommendations, and analytics. Examples are a big semantic network of everyday concepts called ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) and a KG of scholarly communications and the relationships, among them the Microsoft Academic Graph .

Conversational interfaces constitute another NLP field that can benefit from world knowledge contained in KGs. Zhou et al. (2018)  Natural language generation (NLG) is a subfield of NLP and computational linguistics that is concerned with models which generate natural language output from scratch. KGs are used in this subfield for producing natural language text from KGs (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2019), generating question-answer pairs (Reddy et al., 2017), the multi-modal task of image captioning (Lu et al., 2018), or data augmentation in low-resource settings (Sharifirad et al., 2018).

Text analysis combines various analytical NLP techniques and methods that are applied to process and understand textual data. Exemplary tasks are sentiment detection (Kumar et al., 2018), topic modeling , or word sense disambiguation .

Augmented language models are a combination of large pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT (Radford et al., 2018) with knowledge contained in KGs. Since PLMs derive their knowledge from huge amounts of unstructured training data, a rising research trend is in combining them with structured knowledge. Knowledge from KGs can be infused into language models in their input, architecture, output, or some combination thereof (Colon-Hernandez et al., 2021). Some notable examples we outline are ERNIE (Zhang et al., 2019b), COMET (Bosselut et al., 2019), K-BERT (Liu et al., 2020b), and KEPLER (Wang et al., 2021b). Table 3 shows the distribution of papers according to the different research and contribution types as defined in Table 4 and 5 in the Appendix. It shows that most papers conduct validation research, investigating new techniques or methods that have not yet been implemented in practice. A considerable number of papers, although significantly less, focus on solution proposals of approaches by demonstrating their advantages and applicability by a small example or argumentation. However, these papers usually lack a profound empirical evaluation. Secondary research accounts for only a small number of papers and is severely underrepresented in the research field of KGs in NLP. As already mentioned in Section 1 and Section 2, there is a notable lack of studies that summarize, compile, or synthesize existing research regarding KGs in NLP.

Transparency and Accountability KGs should by default be published with bias-sensitive documentation to facilitate transparency and accountability regarding potential risks. Data Statements (Bender and Friedman, 2018) report curation criteria, language variety, demographics of the data authors and annotators, relevant indicators of context, quality, and provenance. Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al., 2021) additionally state motivation, composition, preparation, distribution, and maintenance. The associated questionnaire can accompany the dataset creation process to avoid risks early on. Especially in the case of ongoing crowdsourcing efforts for encyclopedic KGs the demographic background of contributors should be reported (Demartini, 2019). Researchers using subsets of these KGs, should investigate respective data dumps for potential biases and report limitations transparently. Similarly, KG embedding models should be published with Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2019) documenting intended use, underlying data, ethical considerations, and limitations. Stating the contact details for reporting problems and concerns establishes accountability (Mitchell et al., 2019;Gebru et al., 2021).

Improving Representativeness To tackle selection bias, data collection should aim to employ authors and annotators from diverse social groups and with varied cultural imprints. Annotations should be determined via aggregation (see Hovy and Prabhumoye, 2021). For open editable KGs, interventions like edit-a-thons are helpful to introduce more authors from underrepresented groups (Vetter et al., 2022) (e.g., the Art+Feminism campaign aims to fill the gender gap in Wikimedia knowledge bases 8 ). In order for such interventions to take effect, research must update data bases and benchmarks frequently (see Koch et al., 2021). In addition, the timeliness of encyclopedic data is necessary to avoid perpetuating historic biases.

Tackling Algorithmic Bias Evaluation and prevention of harmful biases must become part of the development pipeline (Stanczak and Augenstein, 2021). Algorithmic biases are best evaluated with a combination of multiple quantitative (Section 5) and qualitative measures (Kraft et al., 2022;Dev et al., 2021), considering multiple demographic dimensions (beyond gender and occupation). Evaluating the content of attributions in light of social discourse and the intended use of a technology facilitates an assessment of potential harms (Selbst et al., 2019). Downstream task bias may exist independently from a measured embedding bias (Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2021), therefore a taskand context-oriented evaluation is preferred (Section 6). We have presented several bias-mitigating strategies for different KGEs, which might alleviate the issue in some cases (Section 7). However, more research is needed to establish more effective and robust mitigation methods, as well as metrics used to evaluate their impact (Gonen and Goldberg, 2019;Blodgett et al., 2020).","1.

252819333,A Survey of Automatic Text Summarization using Graph Neural Networks,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/923a7db0522f53e7a01e1c7303d45fef0091fcb8,Spatial Convolution and Message Passing,4,"One can view spatial convolution as used in GNNs as a generalization of the convolution used in neu-ral networks such as CNNs. As an example, in the case of images, one can imagine 2D convolution as being applied to a regular grid of nodes where each node represents a pixel in the image. The resulting 2D convolution applied to one target node is then the weighted average of node (pixel) values of the neighbours of the target node. Generalizing this idea to a non-regular grids leads to spatial convolution. However, different to images and regular grids, in graphs, the neighbours of each target node are unordered and can vary in number and their feature vector representation. The major challenge with this extension consists therefore in dealing with the unordered and inconsistent neighbourhood sizes inherent to homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, with an additional challenge being posed by the differing feature vector representations in heterogeneous graphs.

Directly translating the above description of convolution into a mathematical formulation leads to a valid information propagation scheme. However, such a description suffers from scalability issues due to it directly operating over the entire graph. As such modern GNNs use, what is commonly referred to as, message passing. In practice, this means that nodes within the graph exchange messages (perform convolutions) with their neighbours for a number of iterations. Thereby the network is able to diffuse information throughout the graph. Consequently, the more iterations, the further outwards information is propagated throughout the graph. In the terminology of CNNs one would say that the more message passing iterations, the larger the receptive field of the convolution. Formally, one can define message passing (Grattarola and Alippi, 2021) for each time step t as two equations:

This first equation describes how messages are generated. A differentiable function ϕ generates messages m for each edge which connects nodes using the node features and edge feature present.

The above equation is the core of the message passing framework and describes how each node feature is updated. The first part consists in the application of a permutation-invariant reduction function ρ. This function aggregates all incoming messages to a node. Then another differen-tiable function ψ combines the reduced messages received with the previous state. Using these two equations one can utilize message passing for learnable layers.

The convolution layer for a GNN is then defined with a learnable weight W such that the message per edge is m t+1 i,j = x t j and the aggregation is the normalized sum of messages, i.e.

where M (i) represents the set of messages received by node i, σ is the activation function, b is the bias, and c j,i is an appropriate scaling factor, e.g., the square root of the node degree. Note how it is important for the reduction function, in this case a sum function, to be permutation-invariant as otherwise GNNs could not handle the unordered nature of graphs.

The above presented convolution layer does not allow the model to filter unimportant neighbours. Inspired by the attention mechanism popularized by transformer networks (Vaswani et al., 2017), graph attention networks (GAT) (Veličković et al., 2018) assign attention scores to each neighbour. A schematic depiction of the two variants of spatial convolution can be seen in Figure 1 with GAT depicted on the lower part of the figure. The introduction of attention scores to the spatial convolution allows the model to explicitly assign importance to certain nodes and their messages. Just as in transformers GAT is formulated with multi-head attention. The modification to the previously presented convolution layer follows closely the common attention formulation. Formally, x t+1

where α i,j is the attention score between node i and node j and K denotes the number of concatenated heads. The attention scores are computed with

. This score is then normalized to obtain the attention score per edge α i,j = sof tmax i (r i,j ). We want to highlight here a recent development which Brody et al. (2021) simply denote as GATv2. Their main improvement aims at the fact that in the above calculation both learnable parameters a and W effectively fold into a single linear layer, thus the expressive power of the layer is less than what it could be. The fix introduced by GATv2 pulls the two parameters apart, thus achieving more expressive power while not increasing computational complexity. Taking the above description the attention score for GATv2 is modified as follows

). In both synthetic and real datasets this modification shows superior performance, which is supported by a theoretical analysis of the authors.

There are numerous modifications and extensions to the basic convolution presented here. However, for ATS models, GAT layers are dominating as the workhorse for most models. The reasoning for their dominance can be explained by the similar success that attention transformers have had in conventional neural networks for AST. We expect that GATv2 will continue this trend as it is an attractive and simple improvement for the currently dominating GAT. Although the authors of GATv2 note that it is not yet entirely clear which tasks would benefit the most from the usage of GATv2 over GAT, which will require more research and models to use GATv2.

In ATS the graphs used are in nearly all cases not homogeneous. However, the equations presented here do not work for heterogeneous graphs. The solution for this problem involves defining one convolution layer for each node type combination occurring within the graph. In the case of the already discussed sentence and word node graph there would be four possible combinations of types, and four convolution layers which would have to be defined if the graph were fully connected.

Convolution is a central aspect of GNNs, but pooling also presents an important and common operation, especially whenever GNNs are used jointly with other models. Pooling in GNNs is achieved by generating a global representation of the graph, or a subset of the graph, by pooling together features of nodes. This is usually done with some function f where f is commonly the mean, max or sum.

We want to explicitly point out to the reader that the construction of GNNs does not require special datasets. All GNN models for ATS use the common benchmark single-document and multidocument summarization datasets such as DUC 2004 or CNN/Dailymail. The only requirement for any ATS, or textual dataset, is for the designer to find an appropriate way of encoding sentences, words, subwords etc. into feature vectors, and finding a sensible way of connecting them.","1.

10. In practice, this means that nodes within the graph exchange messages (perform convolutions) with their neighbours for a number of iterations.
11. Thereby the network is able to diffuse information throughout the graph.
12. Consequently, the more iterations, the further outwards information is propagated throughout the graph.
13. In the terminology of CNNs one would say that the more message passing iterations, the larger the receptive field of the convolution.
14. Formally, one can define message passing (Grattarola and Alippi, 2021) for each time step t as two equations:This first equation describes how messages are generated.
15. A differentiable function ϕ generates messages m for each edge which connects nodes using the node features and edge feature present.
16. The above equation is the core of the message passing framework and describes how each node feature is updated.
17. The first part consists in the application of a permutation-invariant reduction function ρ.
18. This function aggregates all incoming messages to a node.
19. Then another differen-tiable function ψ combines the reduced messages received with the previous state.
20. Using these two equations one can utilize message passing for learnable layers.
21. The convolution layer for a GNN is then defined with a learnable weight W such that the message per edge is m t+1
22. i,j = x t j and the aggregation is the normalized sum of messages, i.e.where M (i) represents the set of messages received by node i, σ is the activation function, b is the bias, and c j,i is an appropriate scaling factor, e.g., the square root of the node degree.
23. Note how it is important for the reduction function, in this case a sum function, to be permutation-invariant as otherwise GNNs could not handle the unordered nature of graphs.
24. The above presented convolution layer does not allow the model to filter unimportant neighbours.
25. Inspired by the attention mechanism popularized by transformer networks (Vaswani et al., 2017), graph attention networks (GAT) (Veličković et al., 2018) assign attention scores to each neighbour.
26. A schematic depiction of the two variants of spatial convolution can be seen in Figure 1 with GAT depicted on the lower part of the figure.
27. The introduction of attention scores to the spatial convolution allows the model to explicitly assign importance to certain nodes and their messages.
28. Just as in transformers GAT is formulated with multi-head attention.
29. The modification to the previously presented convolution layer follows closely the common attention formulation.
30. Formally, x t+1where α i,j is the attention score between node i and node j and K denotes the number of concatenated heads.
31. The attention scores are computed with.
32. This score is then normalized to obtain the attention score per edge α i,j = sof tmax i (r i,j ).
33. We want to highlight here a recent development which Brody et al. (2021) simply denote as GATv2.
34. Their main improvement aims at the fact that in the above calculation both learnable parameters a and W effectively fold into a single linear layer, thus the expressive power of the layer is less than what it could be.
35. The fix introduced by GATv2 pulls the two parameters apart, thus achieving more expressive power while not increasing computational complexity.
36. Taking the above description the attention score for GATv2 is modified as follows).
37. In both synthetic and real datasets this modification shows superior performance, which is supported by a theoretical analysis of the authors.
38. There are numerous modifications and extensions to the basic convolution presented here.
39. However, for ATS models, GAT layers are dominating as the workhorse for most models.
40. The reasoning for their dominance can be explained by the similar success that attention transformers have had in conventional neural networks for AST.
41. We expect that GATv2 will continue this trend as it is an attractive and simple improvement for the currently dominating GAT.
42. Although the authors of GATv2 note that it is not yet entirely clear which tasks would benefit the most from the usage of GATv2 over GAT, which will require more research and models to use GATv2.
43. In ATS the graphs used are in nearly all cases not homogeneous.
44. However, the equations presented here do not work for heterogeneous graphs.
45. The solution for this problem involves defining one convolution layer for each node type combination occurring within the graph.
46. In the case of the already discussed sentence and word node graph there would be four possible combinations of types, and four convolution layers which would have to be defined if the graph were fully connected.
47. Convolution is a central aspect of GNNs, but pooling also presents an important and common operation, especially whenever GNNs are used jointly with other models.
48. Pooling in GNNs is achieved by generating a global representation of the graph, or a subset of the graph, by pooling together features of nodes.
49. This is usually done with some function f where f is commonly the mean, max or sum.
50. We want to explicitly point out to the reader that the construction of GNNs does not require special datasets.
51. All GNN models for ATS use the common benchmark single-document and multidocument summarization datasets such as DUC 2004 or CNN/Dailymail.
52. The only requirement for any ATS, or textual dataset, is for the designer to find an appropriate way of encoding sentences, words, subwords etc. into feature vectors, and finding a sensible way of connecting them.","sent1: One can view spatial convolution as used in GNNs as a generalization of the convolution used in neu-ral networks such as CNNs.
sent2: As an example, in the case of images, one can imagine 2D convolution as being applied to a regular grid of nodes where each node represents a pixel in the image.
sent3: The resulting 2D convolution applied to one target node is then the weighted average of node (pixel) values of the neighbours of the target node.
sent4: Generalizing this idea to a non-regular grids leads to spatial convolution.
sent5: However, different to images and regular grids, in graphs, the neighbours of each target node are unordered and can vary in number and their feature vector representation.
sent6: The major challenge with this extension consists therefore in dealing with the unordered and inconsistent neighbourhood sizes inherent to homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, with an additional challenge being posed by the differing feature vector representations in heterogeneous graphs.

252819333,A Survey of Automatic Text Summarization using Graph Neural Networks,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/923a7db0522f53e7a01e1c7303d45fef0091fcb8,Standalone GNNs,8,"We will start our discussion of standalone GNN models with HeterSumGraph (HSG), a model proposed by . We will do so due to the fact that this model illustrates concepts and ideas seen throughout GNNs models used for ATS. An illustration of the general concepts presented here can be seen in Figure 3.

The HSG model encodes each text into a graph with three node types, sentence nodes, word nodes and document nodes. The connection between these nodes is decided by inclusion i.e. if the word represented by a word node occurs in a sentence then their respective nodes are connected by an edge. The same principle applies to document nodes which are connected depending on whether a word, represented by a word node, occurs within the document. This is a flexible structure, as it can be used in a single-document but also multidocument setting.  Figure 3: General architecture of standalone GNNs with word nodes and sentence nodes, encoders for both node types and a sentence selection mechanism. Inspired by HSG.

The feature vectors for all nodes are obtained by encoders and the edge weights are obtained by computing the TF-IDF score for each word. The neural network consists of a modified GAT layer. The GAT is modified to consider the TF-IDF value of the connecting edge. Additionally a positionwise feed-forward (FFN) layer consisting of two linear transformations is applied to the hidden state after the convolution. In total three convolution layers are used, word-sentence, sentence-word and word-document. The model is then trained on a node-based binary classification task that is predicting whether a sentence node is to be included for the summary or not.

The classification itself is done by a single linear layer. The model then does not directly use the predicted nodes to produce the summary. Instead trigram blocking (Paulus et al., 2018) is used during sentence selection in order to ensure sparsity of the generated summary.

The results for this model are quite impressive as it outperforms non-BERT based models on both single-document and multi-document summarization for the CNN/DailyMail dataset. One should especially note the flexibility and ability to use this model for two tasks.

An older model by Muratore et al. (2010) can be considered a precursor to this architecture. A simple extension to the HSG model is proposed by Ya et al. (2021). In their extension they modify the model for query constraints for the summary. This is achieved by adding a query node to the graph structure. Additionally, they introduce a mu-tual information maximization mechanism during training.

A model which further follows this structure is the one by Linmei et al. (2019). The authors there extend the attention mechanism by adding another layer of attention, allowing it to include information about the type of the node during convolution. The GNN model by Jing et al. (2021) encodes even more information into the graph by considering the relation between sentences on a number of different levels. In particular, they encode the semantic and syntactical relationship between sentences within the graph.

This idea of encoding additional information into the graph is also followed by Antognini and Faltings (2019). They introduce an additional universal feature vector which is added to each sentence node embedding. This universal feature vector is learned from a large unrelated and general corpus. This model is also unique in that it focuses on the summarization of very small texts, on average less than 100 words.

Taking this basic structure and idea even further is the model called HAHSum by Jia et al. (2020a). The construction of the input graph for HAHSum is more involved as it aims to significantly reduce semantic sparsity by utilizing named entities. The model uses three types of nodes, named entity nodes, word nodes and sentence nodes, with the named entity nodes being anonymized tokens. The graph is then built as follows, word nodes are connected with a directed edge to a sentence node if they occur within the sentence. Two named entities are connected with an undirected edge if they represent the same entity and two sentence nodes are connected with an undirected edge if they share a trigram. Additionally, sequentially occurring words and entities are connected with a directed edge. This setup shows how one can encode a substantial amount of implicit information in an explicit manner.

HAHSum uses a GAT for each of the five node type combinations found within the graph. Just as in HSG, a FFN is applied after the multi-head attention and again as in the previous model a linear layer is used to perform the binary classification of the sentence nodes.

The results for HAHSum show that GNNs can perform very well. The authors of the paper tested the model on the CNN/Daily Mail, Newsroom and NYT dataset. The model outperforms very pow- erful models such as MATCHSUM (Zhong et al., 2020) and is even able to compete in some metrics with leading abstractive models such as PEGASUS . The results of an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment corroborate these results and show that for human readers HAHSum produce summaries with superior fluency and conciseness. Another recent GNN model which has achieved great performance in the task of multi-document summarization is the SgSum model by . Different to the approaches outlined above, the SgSum model uses graph pooling to extract sub-graphs from encoded documents. That is, it first transforms the documents into a large graph, then generates a number of sub-graphs via pooling and convolution. These sub-graphs are then ranked and thereby selected for a summary. This is quite an innovative approach as it casts the problem of multi-document summarization as a simple subgraph selection problem. Additionally, it outputs an integral summary, that is the entire summary is output by the model in the form of the sub-graph of sentences.","1.

sent42: The results for HAHSum show that GNNs can perform very well.
sent43: The authors of the paper tested the model on the CNN/Daily Mail, Newsroom and NYT dataset.
sent44: The model outperforms very pow- erful models such as MATCHSUM (Zhong et al., 2020) and is even able to compete in some metrics with leading abstractive models such as PEGASUS .
sent45: The results of an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment corroborate these results and show that for human readers HAHSum produce summaries with superior fluency and conciseness.
sent46: Another recent GNN model which has achieved great performance in the task of multi-document summarization is the SgSum model by .
sent47: Different to the approaches outlined above, the SgSum model uses graph pooling to extract sub-graphs from encoded documents.
sent48: That is, it first transforms the documents into a large graph, then generates a number of sub-graphs via pooling and convolution.
sent49: These sub-graphs are then ranked and thereby selected for a summary.
sent50: This is quite an innovative approach as it casts the problem of multi-document summarization as a simple subgraph selection problem.
sent51: Additionally, it outputs an integral summary, that is the entire summary is output by the model in the form of the sub-graph of sentences.","1. What is the focus of the discussion in this section? sent1

Ideally, the selected instances should be the ones that most reduce future errors if labeled and added to the training set. This motivates the expected error reduction strategy (Roy and McCallum, 2001), which chooses instances that lead to the least expected error if added to retrain a model. This strategy can be computationally costly since retraining is needed for each candidate.

Recently, methods have been proposed to learn another model to select instances that lead to the fewest errors, usually measured on a held-out development set. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning have been utilized to train such policy models (Bachman et al., 2017;Fang et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018a,b). This learning-to-select strategy may have some constraints. First, it requires labeled data (maybe from another domain) to train the policy. To mitigate this reliance, Vu et al. (2019) use the current task model as an imperfect annotator for AL simulations. Moreover, the learning signals may be unstable for complex tasks, as Koshorek et al. (2019) show for semantic tasks.

A similar and simpler idea is to select the most erroneous or ambiguous instances with regard to the current task model, which can also be done with another performance-prediction model.

In this section, we describe the tasks and define their input and output. While they all consume tables, settings can be quite heterogeneous, with systems exploiting different information, even for the same task. A summary of the covered tasks along their input, output, and some representative systems addressing them is shown in Table 4. We detail next the mandatory input elements and the different contexts.  (Dagan et al., 2013;Korman et al., 2018), checking facts with tables consists of verifying if a textual input claim is true or false against a trusted database (TAPEX, DECO, TABFACT), also provided as input. Some fact-checking systems, such as FEVEROUS, also output the cells used for verification as evidence (Nakov et al., 2021;Karagiannis et al., 2020).

Question Answering (QA): In the free text setting, QA aims at retrieving passages that include the answer to a given question. In the tabular data setting, it consists of returning as output the cells that answer an input consisting of a question and a table. One can distinguish two levels of complexity. Simple QA involves lookup queries on tables (DTR, CLTR), while a more complex QA  Most of the systems in this survey aim at improving accuracy in QA with respect to hand-crafted embeddings.

Semantic Parsing (SP): In the tabular data setting, given a question and a table as input, SP generates a declarative query in SQL over the table's schema to retrieve the answer to the question. While in QA the interest is in directly getting the answer, SP produces the (interpretable) query to obtain it (TABERT, GRAPPA, TAPEX).  table that can be used to answer the question. TR is helpful when trying to reduce the search space for a QA task (GTR, DTR, MMR). It is a challenging task given the limited input size of transformers, that is, their constraint to sequences of 512 tokens.  We observe that most tasks can be seen as traditional NLP problems where structured data replace free text, such as the case of QA where answers are located in tabular data instead of documents (Gupta and Gupta, 2012). TFC involves retrieving cells that entail or refute a given statement, whereas on free text the corresponding objective is to select sentences as evidence (Thorne et al., 2018). SP is the task of converting natural language utterance into a logical form (Berant and Liang, 2014), which in this setting is expressed as a declarative query over a relational table. TR on tabular data corresponds to passage retrieval on free text (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997). TCP is analogous to predicting missing words or values in a sentence . Finally, TMP can be related to syntactic parsing in NLP (Van Gompel and Pickering, 2007), where relationships between different tokens are depicted.

We conclude this section with an analysis of the performance of the systems over the different downstream tasks. For every task, we selected datasets for which at least two systems have reported results. All datasets reported in Table 5 (Ghasemi-Gol and Szekely, 2018), which contains web tables annotated with their type (relational, entity, matrix, list, and non-data), and EntiTab (Zhang and Balog, 2017), which contains web tables annotated with possible header labels for the column population task. Table 5 also contains the size, expressed as number of parameters, of the largest model used by every system. As some systems are not comparable on any shared datasets, we report here their size: TABFACT (110M), MMR (87M), TURL (314M), RPT (139M), and CLTR (235M). Larger models do not correlate with better performance across different systems for the same task, but a larger model always brings higher scores for the same system, as expected. Execution times for training and testing depend on the size of the model and the computing architecture.

The results in the table show that some tasks, such as TFC and TMP, can already be handled successfully by the systems, while some tasks, such as TCP, TR, and SP, are harder. QA is the task supported by most systems and the quality of the results vary depending on the dataset at hand. Differences in performance can be explained with different improvements across the systems. For example, MATE has better performance with respect to TAPAS in two tasks because of its mechanism to deal with larger input tables. Similarly, TUTA improves over TABERT because it handles tabular data beyond relational tables. Finally, TABERT and TAPAS are the systems that show most coverage in terms of tasks, with multiple papers using them as baselines in their experiments. For the systems that are not reported in Table 5, we notice that TURL obtains similar F1 results for column type prediction, but on a dataset different from VizNet; TURL, TABBIE, and TABERT also report comparable MAP results for the row population task (not in Table 5) over different datasets.","1.

34. Finally, TABERT and TAPAS are the systems that show most coverage in terms of tasks, with multiple papers using them as baselines in their experiments.
35. For the systems that are not reported in Table 5, we notice that TURL obtains similar F1 results for column type prediction, but on a dataset different from VizNet; TURL, TABBIE, and TABERT also report comparable MAP results for the row population task (not in Table 5) over different datasets.","sent1: Using neural representations for tabular data show, improvements in performance in several downstream tasks.
sent2: In this section, we describe the tasks and define their input and output.
sent3: While they all consume tables, settings can be quite heterogeneous, with systems exploiting different information, even for the same task.
sent4: A summary of the covered tasks along their input, output, and some representative systems addressing them is shown in Table 4.
sent5: We detail next the mandatory input elements and the different contexts.
sent6: (Dagan et al., 2013;Korman et al., 2018), checking facts with tables consists of verifying if a textual input claim is true or false against a trusted database (TAPEX, DECO, TABFACT), also provided as input.
sent7: Some fact-checking systems, such as FEVEROUS, also output the cells used for verification as evidence (Nakov et al., 2021;Karagiannis et al., 2020).
sent8: Question Answering (QA): In the free text setting, QA aims at retrieving passages that include the answer to a given question.
sent9: In the tabular data setting, it consists of returning as output the cells that answer an input consisting of a question and a table.
sent10: One can distinguish two levels of complexity.
sent11: Simple QA involves lookup queries on tables (DTR, CLTR), while a more complex QA  Most of the systems in this survey aim at improving accuracy in QA with respect to hand-crafted embeddings.
sent12: Semantic Parsing (SP): In the tabular data setting, given a question and a table as input, SP generates a declarative query in SQL over the table's schema to retrieve the answer to the question.
sent13: While in QA the interest is in directly getting the answer, SP produces the (interpretable) query to obtain it (TABERT, GRAPPA, TAPEX).  table that can be used to answer the question.
sent14: TR is helpful when trying to reduce the search space for a QA task (GTR, DTR, MMR).
sent15: It is a challenging task given the limited input size of transformers, that is, their constraint to sequences of 512 tokens.
sent16: We observe that most tasks can be seen as traditional NLP problems where structured data replace free text, such as the case of QA where answers are located in tabular data instead of documents (Gupta and Gupta, 2012).
sent17: TFC involves retrieving cells that entail or refute a given statement, whereas on free text the corresponding objective is to select sentences as evidence (Thorne et al., 2018).
sent18: SP is the task of converting natural language utterance into a logical form (Berant and Liang, 2014), which in this setting is expressed as a declarative query over a relational table.
sent19: TR on tabular data corresponds to passage retrieval on free text (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997).
sent20: TCP is analogous to predicting missing words or values in a sentence .
sent21: Finally, TMP can be related to syntactic parsing in NLP (Van Gompel and Pickering, 2007), where relationships between different tokens are depicted.
sent22: We conclude this section with an analysis of the performance of the systems over the different downstream tasks.
sent23: For every task, we selected datasets for which at least two systems have reported results.
sent24: All datasets reported in Table 5 (Ghasemi-Gol and Szekely, 2018), which contains web tables annotated with their type (relational, entity, matrix, list, and non-data), and EntiTab (Zhang and Balog, 2017), which contains web tables annotated with possible header labels for the column population task.
sent25: Table 5 also contains the size, expressed as number of parameters, of the largest model used by every system.
sent26: As some systems are not comparable on any shared datasets, we report here their size: TABFACT (110M), MMR (87M), TURL (314M), RPT (139M), and CLTR (235M).
sent27: Larger models do not correlate with better performance across different systems for the same task, but a larger model always brings higher scores for the same system, as expected.
sent28: Execution times for training and testing depend on the size of the model and the computing architecture.
sent29: The results in the table show that some tasks, such as TFC and TMP, can already be handled successfully by the systems, while some tasks, such as TCP, TR, and SP, are harder.
sent30: QA is the task supported by most systems and the quality of the results vary depending on the dataset at hand.
sent31: Differences in performance can be explained with different improvements across the systems.
sent32: For example, MATE has better performance with respect to TAPAS in two tasks because of its mechanism to deal with larger input tables.
sent33: Similarly, TUTA improves over TABERT because it handles tabular data beyond relational tables.
sent34: Finally, TABERT and TAPAS are the systems that show most coverage in terms of tasks, with multiple papers using them as baselines in their experiments.

We suggest that individual researchers provide the input data source and the labeling methodology; if people were involved in dataset creation, their demographic information should be provided, as well. Such information can help researchers analyze potential bias embedded in the dataset (Bender and Friedman, 2018).

Surveyed Dataset Collection Process. Despite our best efforts, we do not claim to cover all relevant datasets. Our collection process overlooks datasets that are published at non-ACL venues and not in Hugging Face as well as papers that do not match our search keywords. For instance, we missed multilingual machine reading comprehension datasets (Gupta and Khade, 2020;Asai et al., 2018) and morphology datasets (McCarthy et al., 2020). We also found a very low presence of indigenous language datasets. None of 10 indigenous American languages from a recent study (Ebrahimi et al., 2022) was represented in our survey. That said, we host http: //multilingual-dataset-survey.github.io where researchers can submit their dataset information and periodically update our analysis. Furthermore, we constantly encountered poorly written documentation or unavailable datasets during our annotation processes. During annotation, whenever this paper's dataset annotators encountered unclear documentation, they made their best guess to put datasets into predefined categories. If no evidence could be found for the inference, they put ""not mentioned"" as a result. All unclear decision were adjudicated by at least three annotators.

Using Country Names as a Proxy for Languages Spoken. In Section 5, we attempted to approximate the number of NLP researchers with language proficiency in different languages. To do this, we mapped the names of ACL submission country to the most commonly spoken languages in those countries. We acknowledge that (1) the country of origin of researchers might be different from the country of submission, (2) researchers native language might not be listed in the commonly spoken languages and (3) the mapping might be incomprehensive.

MTurk Pilot Study. Due to our limited data points, although our MTurk study showed that data quality could be improved if the language qualification were applied in the collection process on MTurk, and our previous recommendations do not currently apply, we acknowledge that more research at scale should be done to statistically confirm the conclusion. Furthermore, languages other than the supported 5 languages might still be unsuitable for gathering multilingual data on MTurk As we identify that many datasets use texts beyond Wikipedia (see Table 4), we instead use the mC4 corpora (Xue et al., 2021), a much larger collection of texts in 101 languages drawn from the public Common Crawl web scrape and used for training the mT5 model. Specifically, we use the number of tokens in mC4 to estimate the amount of unlabeled data. Figure 7a shows a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the number of tokens in mC4 and y-axis represents the number of labeled datasets available in the languages. The availability of unlabeled text corpora and the number of labeled datasets show a high correlation (ρ = 0.794).

sent5: Our collection process overlooks datasets that are published at non-ACL venues and not in Hugging Face as well as papers that do not match our search keywords.
sent6: For instance, we missed multilingual machine reading comprehension datasets (Gupta and Khade, 2020;Asai et al., 2018) and morphology datasets (McCarthy et al., 2020).
sent7: We also found a very low presence of indigenous language datasets.
sent8: None of 10 indigenous American languages from a recent study (Ebrahimi et al., 2022) was represented in our survey.
sent9: That said, we host http: //multilingual-dataset-survey.github.io where researchers can submit their dataset information and periodically update our analysis.
sent10: Furthermore, we constantly encountered poorly written documentation or unavailable datasets during our annotation processes.
sent11: During annotation, whenever this paper's dataset annotators encountered unclear documentation, they made their best guess to put datasets into predefined categories.
sent12: If no evidence could be found for the inference, they put ""not mentioned"" as a result.
sent13: All unclear decision were adjudicated by at least three annotators.
sent14: Using Country Names as a Proxy for Languages Spoken.
sent15: In Section 5, we attempted to approximate the number of NLP researchers with language proficiency in different languages.
sent16: To do this, we mapped the names of ACL submission country to the most commonly spoken languages in those countries.
sent17: We acknowledge that (1) the country of origin of researchers might be different from the country of submission, (2) researchers native language might not be listed in the commonly spoken languages and (3) the mapping might be incomprehensive.
sent18: MTurk Pilot Study. Due to our limited data points, although our MTurk study showed that data quality could be improved if the language qualification were applied in the collection process on MTurk, and our previous recommendations do not currently apply, we acknowledge that more research at scale should be done to statistically confirm the conclusion.
sent19: Furthermore, languages other than the supported 5 languages might still be unsuitable for gathering multilingual data on MTurk As we identify that many datasets use texts beyond Wikipedia (see Table 4), we instead use the mC4 corpora (Xue et al., 2021), a much larger collection of texts in 101 languages drawn from the public Common Crawl web scrape and used for training the mT5 model.
sent20: Specifically, we use the number of tokens in mC4 to estimate the amount of unlabeled data.
sent21: Figure 7a shows a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the number of tokens in mC4 and y-axis represents the number of labeled datasets available in the languages.
sent22: The availability of unlabeled text corpora and the number of labeled datasets show a high correlation (ρ = 0.794).
sent23: We also analyze the relationship between the number of labeled datasets and the number of Wikipedia articles in Figure 7b.
sent24: Again we observe a high correlation of ρ = 0.767.

In contrast, the statistical and rule-based approaches are diminishing. Compared to ISCA, we see more adaptation of the pre-training model. This is because ACL work is more text-based focused, where pre-trained LMs are more widely available.

Neural-Based Models Figure 5 shows that the trend of using neural-based models started in 2013, and the usage of rule/linguistic constraint and statistical methods diminished gradually through time, but they are still used even with a low percentage. RNN and LSTM architectures are commonly used in sequence modeling, such as language modeling (Adel et al., 2013;Vu and Schultz, 2014;Adel et al., 2014c;Winata et al., 2018a;Garg et al., 2018a;Winata et al., 2019c) and CSW identification (Samih et al., 2016a). DNN-based and hybrid HMM-DNN models are used in speech recognition models .

Pre-trained Embeddings Pre-trained embeddings are used to complement neural-based approaches by initializing the embedding layer. Common pre-trained embeddings used in the literature are monolingual subword-based embeddings, Fast-Text (Joulin et al., 2016), and aligned-embeddings MUSE (Conneau et al., 2017). A standard method to utilize monolingual embeddings is to concatenate or sum two or more embeddings from different languages (Trivedi et al., 2018). A more recent approach is to apply an attention mechanism to merge embeddings and form metaembeddings (Winata et al., 2019a,b). Characterbased embeddings have also been explored in the literature to address the out-of-vocabulary issues on word-embeddings (Winata et al., 2018b;Attia et al., 2018;Aguilar et al., 2021). Another approach is to train bilingual embeddings using real and synthetic CSW data (Pratapa et al., 2018b). In the speech domain, Lovenia et al. (2022) utilize wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) as a starting model before fine-tuning.

Language Models Many pre-trained model approaches utilize multilingual LMs, such as mBERT or XLM-R to deal with CSW data (Khanuja et al., 2020b;Aguilar and Solorio, 2020;Pant and Dadu, 2020;Patwa et al., 2020;Winata et al., 2021a). These models are often fine-tuned with the downstream task or with CSW text to better adapt to the languages. Some downstream fine-tuning approaches use synthetic CSW data due to a lack of available datasets. Aguilar et al. (2021) propose a character-based subword module (char2subword) of the mBERT that learns the subword embedding that is suitable for modeling the noisy CSW text. Winata et al. (2021a) compare the performance of the multilingual LM versus the language-specific LM for CSW context. While XLM-R provides the best result, it is also computationally heavy. There needed to be more exploration of larger models. We see that pre-trained LMs provide better empirical results on current benchmark tasks and enables an end-to-end approach. Therefore, one can theoretically work on CSW tasks without any linguistic understanding of the language, assuming the dataset for model finetuning is available. However, the downside is that there is little understanding of how and when the LMs would fail, thus we encourage more interpretability work on these LMs in CSW setting.  et al., 2023), especially on different CSW variations.

Negotiation is used to manage conflict and is the primary give-and-take process by which people try to reach an agreement (Fisher et al., 2011;Lewicki et al., 2011). Research on negotiation has been conducted for almost 60 years in the field of psychology, political science, and communication. It has evolved over the past decades from exploring game theory (Walton and McKersie, 1991), behavior decisions driven by the cognitive revolution in psychology (Bazerman and Neale, 1993), to cultural differences in the 2000s (Bazerman et al., 2000). Negotiation research, however, is now forced to confront the implications of human/AI collaborations given recent advancements in machine learning (Sycara and Dai, 2010). Converging efforts from social scientists and data scientists who incorporate insights from both fields will be fruitful in maximizing expectations and outcomes during negotiation processes.

Negotiation is a process by which two or more parties attempt to resolve their opposing interests. Strategy of negotiation can be distributive, such as bargaining (Fershtman, 1990) and integrative, such as maximizing unilateral interests (Bazerman and Neale, 1993), both of which are used in various social situations such as informal, peer to peer, organizational, and diplomatic country to country settings. The implications for enhancing outcomes are thus large and important to understand. Research from psychology demonstrates that the negotiation process can be affected by psychological factors, such as personality (Sharma et al., 2013), relationship (Olekalns and Smith, 2003), social status (Blader and Chen, 2012), and cultural background (Leung and Cohen, 2011).","1.

Reasoning involves making inferences, evaluating arguments, and drawing logical conclusions based on available information. Although ""reasoning"" is a term that is commonly used in literature and daily life, it is also an abstract concept that can refer to many things. To help the reader better understand this concept, we summarize several main categories of reasoning that are commonly recognized:

Deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the truth of the premises. In deductive reasoning, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. For example:

• Premise: All mammals have kidneys. • Premise: All whales are mammals. • Conclusion: All whales have kidneys.

Inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on observations or evidence. The conclusion is likely to be true based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain. For example:

• Observation: Every time we see a creature with wings, it is a bird. • Observation: We see a creature with wings. • Conclusion: The creature is likely to be a bird.

Abductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the best explanation for a given set of observations. The conclusion is the most likely explanation based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain. For example:

• Observation: The car cannot start and there is a puddle of liquid under the engine. • Conclusion: The most likely explanation is that the car has a leak in the radiator.

Other types of reasoning include analogical reasoning, which involves making comparisons between two or more things in order to make inferences or arrive at conclusions; causal reasoning, which involves identifying and understanding the causes and effects of events or phenomena; and probabilistic reasoning, which involves making decisions or arriving at conclusions based on the likelihood or probability of certain outcomes.

Formal Reasoning vs Informal Reasoning. Formal reasoning is a systematic and logical process that follows a set of rules and principles, often used in mathematics and logic. Informal reasoning is a less structured approach that relies on intuition, experience, and common sense to draw conclusions and solve problems, and is often used in everyday life. Formal reasoning is more structured and reliable, while informal reasoning is more adaptable and open-ended, but may also be less reliable. We refer the reader to Galotti (1989); Bronkhorst et al. (2020) for a detailed distinction between them.

Reasoning in Language Models. The concept of reasoning in language models has been around for some time, but there is not a clear definition of what it entails. In the literature, the term ""reasoning"" is often used to refer to informal reasoning, although it is not always explicitly stated that it is informal (Cobbe et al., 2021;Wei et al., 2022b, inter alia). Different forms of reasoning may be used depending on the task, benchmark, or method being used, e.g., deductive reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021;Creswell et al., 2022;Han et al., 2022b, inter alia), inductive reasoning Misra et al., 2022, inter alia) or abductive reasoning (Wiegreffe et al., 2022;Lampinen et al., 2022;Jung et al., 2022, inter alia). In this paper, we encompass various forms of reasoning, with a particular focus on ""informal deductive reasoning"" in large language models since it is a widely used form in which the conclusion is guaranteed to be true as long as the premises are true.","1.

15. Abductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the best explanation for a given set of observations.
16. The conclusion is the most likely explanation based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain.
17. For example:• Observation: The car cannot start and there is a puddle of liquid under the engine.
18. • Conclusion: The most likely explanation is that the car has a leak in the radiator.
19. Other types of reasoning include analogical reasoning, which involves making comparisons between two or more things in order to make inferences or arrive at conclusions; causal reasoning, which involves identifying and understanding the causes and effects of events or phenomena; and probabilistic reasoning, which involves making decisions or arriving at conclusions based on the likelihood or probability of certain outcomes.
20. Formal Reasoning vs Informal Reasoning.
21. Formal reasoning is a systematic and logical process that follows a set of rules and principles, often used in mathematics and logic.
22. Informal reasoning is a less structured approach that relies on intuition, experience, and common sense to draw conclusions and solve problems, and is often used in everyday life.
23. Formal reasoning is more structured and reliable, while informal reasoning is more adaptable and open-ended, but may also be less reliable.
24. We refer the reader to Galotti (1989); Bronkhorst et al. (2020) for a detailed distinction between them.
25. Reasoning in Language Models. The concept of reasoning in language models has been around for some time, but there is not a clear definition of what it entails.
26. In the literature, the term ""reasoning"" is often used to refer to informal reasoning, although it is not always explicitly stated that it is informal (Cobbe et al., 2021;Wei et al., 2022b, inter alia).
27. Different forms of reasoning may be used depending on the task, benchmark, or method being used, e.g., deductive reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021;Creswell et al., 2022;Han et al., 2022b, inter alia), inductive reasoning Misra et al., 2022, inter alia) or abductive reasoning (Wiegreffe et al., 2022;Lampinen et al., 2022;Jung et al., 2022, inter alia).
28. In this paper, we encompass various forms of reasoning, with a particular focus on ""informal deductive reasoning"" in large language models since it is a widely used form in which the conclusion is guaranteed to be true as long as the premises are true.","sent1: Reasoning is the process of thinking about something in a logical and systematic way, using evidence and past experiences to reach a conclusion or make a decision (Wason and Johnson-Laird, 1972;Wason, 1968;Galotti, 1989;Fagin et al., 2004;McHugh and Way, 2018).
sent2: Reasoning involves making inferences, evaluating arguments, and drawing logical conclusions based on available information.
sent3: Although ""reasoning"" is a term that is commonly used in literature and daily life, it is also an abstract concept that can refer to many things.
sent4: To help the reader better understand this concept, we summarize several main categories of reasoning that are commonly recognized:Deductive reasoning.
sent5: Deductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the truth of the premises.
sent6: In deductive reasoning, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.
sent7: For example:• Premise: All mammals have kidneys.
sent8: • Premise: All whales are mammals.
sent9: • Conclusion: All whales have kidneys.
sent10: Inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on observations or evidence.
sent11: The conclusion is likely to be true based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain.
sent12: For example:• Observation: Every time we see a creature with wings, it is a bird.
sent13: • Observation: We see a creature with wings.
sent14: • Conclusion: The creature is likely to be a bird.
sent15: Abductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the best explanation for a given set of observations.

Reasoning seems an emergent ability of LLMs. Wei et al. (2022a,b);  show that reasoning ability appears to emerge only in large language models like GPT-3 175B, as evidenced by significant improvements in performance on reasoning tasks at a certain scale (e.g., 100 billion parameters). This suggests that it may be more effective to utilize large models for general reasoning problems rather than training small models for specific tasks. However, the reason for this emergent ability is not yet fully understood. We refer the reader to Wei et al. (2022a);Fu et al. (2022a) for some potential explanations.

Chain of thought elicits ""reasoning"" of LLMs. The use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts (Wei et al., 2022b) has been shown to improve the performance of LLMs on various reasoning tasks, as demonstrated in the experiments of Wei et al. (2022a,b); . Additionally, Saparov and He (2022) ( §4.2) find that, when using CoT prompts, LLMs are able to produce valid individual proof steps, even when the synthetic ontology is fictional or counterfactual. However, they may sometimes choose the wrong steps when multiple options are available, leading to incomplete or incorrect proofs. Moreover, for many reasoning tasks where the performance of standard prompting grows smoothly with model scale, chain-of-thought prompting can lead to dramatic performance improvement. In addition to these benefits, the use of CoT prompts has been shown to improve the out-ofdistribution robustness of LLMs (Wei et al., 2022b;Zhou et al., 2022a;Anil et al., 2022, inter alia), an advantage that is not typically observed with standard prompting or fully supervised finetuning paradigms.

LLMs show human-like content effects on reasoning. According to Dasgupta et al. (2022), LLMs exhibit reasoning patterns that are similar to those of humans as described in the cognitive literature. For example, the models' predictions are influenced by both prior knowledge and abstract reasoning, and their judgments of logical validity are impacted by the believability of the conclusions. These findings suggest that, although language models may not always perform well on reasoning tasks, their failures often occur in situations that are challenging for humans as well. This provides some evidence that language models may ""reason"" in a way that is similar to human reasoning.

LLMs are still unskilled at complex reasoning. Although LLMs seem to possess impressive reasoning capabilities with the techniques described in §3, they still struggle with more complex reasoning tasks or those involving implicature, according to studies such as Valmeekam et al. (2022);Han et al. (2022a); Ruis et al. (2022). For instance, Valmeekam et al. (2022) find that even in relatively simple commonsense planning domains that humans would have no trouble navigating, LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) struggle to perform effectively. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks may be too simple to accurately gauge the true reasoning abilities of LLMs, and that more challenging tasks may be needed to fully evaluate their abilities in this regard.","1.

Arithmetic Reasoning. Arithmetic reasoning is the ability to understand and apply mathematical concepts and principles in order to solve problems involving arithmetic operations.

Prior work majorly focused on objective metrics which only provides a limited view of the model performance. A comprehensive evaluation is challenging since it must consider partner perception along with objective outcomes. Building user simulators could potentially alleviate this problem (Li et al., 2016;Jain et al., 2018;. Most existing simulators are developed for task-oriented systems which follow a certain agenda. Future research should study how to use partner modeling to build social influence user simulators for more efficient and accurate task evaluation (He et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2020). For instance, one could potentially design different user personalities and simulate the change in user's beliefs, opinions, and attitudes accordingly (Yang et al., 2021).

Multimodal systems: Being a core function of human communication, social influence occurs not just through text, but through all possible modalities. Schulman and Bickmore (2009) showed that embodied agents achieve better persuasion results than text-only agents. Other studies have recognized the importance of emotion in social influence tasks (Asai et al., 2020;Chawla et al., 2021a). Nguyen et al. (2021) proposed a speech dataset in debates and study the influence of spoken tactics on persuasiveness across genders. Given these findings, we encourage interdisciplinary efforts in the future to explore the developement of multimodal social influence agents.

Knowledge-enriched systems: Social influence tasks often involve constantly-changing world knowledge such as organization facts and news. Often, the system's internal state (e.g., the change of task setting from one set of products to a different set) needs to be updated. Retraining the entire system is costly to maintain after the initial development. Recent work has proposed to augment the dialogue system with internet-search ability to generate more factual and updated responses in open-domain dialogues (Komeili et al., 2021). Future efforts in this direction will benefit social influence dialogue systems as well.","1. Another key limitation of existing work is the lack of a comprehensive evaluation.

Most domains have seen efforts in analyzing human dialogue behaviors and their impact on task outcomes. Examples include analyzing deception in games (Peskov et al., 2020), the impact of persuasive strategies and dialogue acts on charity donations ( In addition, researchers have targeted various domain-specific subtasks that can be crucial for the eventual development of dialogue systems in this space. This involves research in lie detection methods (Yeh and Ku, 2021;Yu et al., 2015), discourse parsing (Shi and Huang, 2019;Ouyang et al., 2021), strategy prediction (Chawla et al., 2021b;, breakdown detection (Yamaguchi et al., 2021), outcome prediction (Sinha and Dasgupta, 2021;Chawla et al., 2020;Dutt et al., 2020), and argument mining (Dutta et al., 2022).

Research that directly targets the development of dialogue systems in this space is still nascent. Among other challenges like limited cross-cultural diversity and relatively smaller dataset size, social influence dialogue settings pose a unique challenge: an average human often exhibits sub-optimal strategic behaviors in social influence tasks (Wunderle, 2007;Babcock and Laschever, 2009). This means that standard seq2seq approaches trained on these collected datasets using supervised learning are fundamentally insufficient for developing effective dialogue systems with influence capabilities. Hence, prior work has put a special attention to the system strategy, employing different ways to model the strategy and language together.

We design a taxonomy of methods developed for social influence tasks, assisting readers to comprehend the progress and reflect on future directions. We organize them based on the system strategy, language generation, partner model, architecture, learning process, and the use of pretrained language models.

Apart from that, MLM can also be adapted to multi-modal data called Masked Multimodal Modelling (MMM) (Wu et al., 2022a). MMM was performed by predicting the semantics of masked news and news image regions given the unmasked inputs and indicating whether a news image and news content segment correspond to each other for news recommendation purposes.

The NSP/SOP can be adapted for CTR prediction as Next K Behaviors Prediction (NBP). NBP was proposed to learn user representations in the pre-training stage by inferring whether a candidate behavior is the next i-th behavior of the target user based on their past N behaviors. NBP can also capture the relatedness between past and multiple future behaviors.","1.

sent9: proposed pre-training a transformer model on a reconstructed subgraph from a user-item-attribute heterogeneous graph, using Masked Node Prediction (MNP), Masked Edge Prediction (MEP), and meta-path type prediction as objectives.
sent10: Specifically, MNP was performed by randomly masking a proportion of nodes in a heterogeneous subgraph and then predicting the masked nodes based on the remaining contexts by maximizing the distance between the masked node and the irrelevant node.

sent4: In practice hyperlink-based approaches often perform the best among the heuristics as they have additional reference information to leverage, which makes them most similar to the actual relevance annotations.
sent5: However, hyperlink information is not available in most domains and thereby limits its use cases .
sent6: QG-based WS signals are often preferred over heuristics-based ones as they can produce naturally-sound questions themselves without relying on the chance to find good pseudo questions in the documents.
sent7: Nonetheless, obtaining a high-performing QG can also be non-trivial.
sent8: One big challenge comes from the one-to-many mapping relations between questions and documents.
sent9: Under this situation, standard supervised learning tends to produce safe questions with less diversity and high lexical overlap with the document.
sent10: For example, Shinoda et al. (2021) found that QG reinforces the model bias towards high lexical overlap.
sent11: We will need more sophisticated training techniques such as latent-variable models (Shen and Su, 2018; and reinforcement learning (Yuan et al., 2017;Zhang and Bansal, 2019;Shen et al., 2019a) to alleviate the model bias towards safe questions.","1.

258378266,Neural Ranking with Weak Supervision for Open-Domain Question Answering : A Survey,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c22621ebbdd9c5d73b2eeb2b57dbc9f3547b780e,Resource: Documents + Questions,12,"This section includes WS signals that require additional access to a question set Q. In practice, annotating question-document relations usually requires domain experts to read long documents and careful sampling strategies to ensure enough positive samples, while unlabeled questions are much easier to obtain either through real user-generated content or simulated traffic. Therefore, it is common to have a predominance of unlabeled questions. The crucial point is to establish the missing relevance labels. Suppose a WS method can provide the missing label WS(q, d) for a question-document pair (q, d), then we can use it to supervise the NR model by:

where L is the loss function that encourages similarity between R(q, d) and WS(q, d).

There are three popular types models that can provide such WS signal here: (1) sparse retriever, (2) pre-trained language model and (3) supervised teacher model.

Sparse Retriever (SR) Recent research finds that NR and SR models are complementary. NR models are better at semantic matching while SRs are better at capturing exact match and handling long documents . SRs are also more robust across domains (Thakur et al., 2021;Chen et al., 2022). This motivates the use of unsupervised sparse retrievers like BM25 as WS signals. Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) As PLMs already encode significant linguistic knowledge, there have also been attempts at using promptbased PLMs to provide WS signals for question-document relations (Smith et al., 2022;Zeng et al., 2022). Similar as in question generation, we can use prompts like ""Please write a question based on this passage"", concatenate the document and question, then use the probability assigned by the PLM to auto-label question-document pairs. To maximize the chances of finding positive document, normally we first obtain a set of candidate documents by BM25, then apply PLM to auto-label the candidate set (Sachan et al., 2022). This can further exploit the latent knowledge inside PLMs that has been honed through pre-training, so it often shows better performance compared with weak supervision only using BM25 Singh Sachan et al., 2022).

Supervised Teacher Model A very common choice is using a supervised teacher model to provide WS signals. The teacher model is ""supervised"" because it is explicitly fine-tuned on annotated question-document pairs. When in-domain annotations are not sufficient, we can leverage outof-domain (OOD) annotations, if available, to train the teacher model. The teacher model usually employs a more powerful architecture such as with more complex interactions or larger sizes. It may not be directly applicable in downstream tasks due to the latency constraints, but can be useful in providing WS signals for training the NR model. For example, previous research has shown that models with larger sizes or late/cross-interaction structures generalize much better on OOD data Ni et al., 2021;Rosa et al., 2022;Muennighoff, 2022;. After training a teacher model on OOD annotations, applying it to provide WS signals through targetdomain question and document collections can significantly improve the in-domain performance of the NR model (Hofstätter et al., 2021;Lin et al., 2021b;Lu et al., 2022). Kim et al. (2022) further show that we can even use the same architecture and capacity to obtain a good teacher model. They expand the question with centroids of word embeddings from top retrieved passages (using BM25), and then use the expanded query for self knowledge distillation. Similar ideas of reusing the same architecture to provide WS signals have also been explored by Yu et al. (2021a); Kulshreshtha et al. (2021); Zhuang and Zuccon (2022).","1.

The highest-scoring candidate is then chosen as the final translation. Li et al.

In this section, we provide a brief overview of current benchmarks and metrics, as well as our observations and the open challenges.

We summarize 17 well-studied NL2Code benchmarks in Table 3, where we can find that each of these benchmarks has its own characteristics regarding size, language, complexity, and scenario. We observe that most benchmarks contain a limited number of instances. For example, the widely used HumanEval and MBPP have 164 and 974 instances, respectively. This is because these benchmarks are typically hand-written to ensure that LLMs have not seen them during training. In the era of large language models, it is crucial to avoid data leak-age when creating new benchmarks. Additionally, most current benchmarks have their problem descriptions in English and code solutions in Python.

Recently, several multi-lingual benchmarks have been proposed, such as MBXP (Athiwaratkun et al., 2022), HumanEvalX (Zheng et al., 2023), and Mul-tiPL (Cassano et al., 2022), which cover multiple programming languages, and ODEX (Wang et al., 2022c), which covers multiple natural languages. Details of multi-lingual benchmarks are listed in Appendix Table 7. Furthermore, benchmarks have been proposed for other practical scenarios, such as data science (Lai et al., 2022), public library (Zan et al., 2022b), private library (Zan et al., 2022a), multi-turn program synthesis (Nijkamp et al., 2023), and code security (Siddiq and msiddiq, 2022). For execution-based benchmarks, comprehensive test cases with complete coverage of the generated program can ensure the trustworthiness of evaluation results. As a reference, the average number of test cases for each benchmark, as well as the length statistics of the problem descriptions and solutions are also provided in Table 3.

Manually evaluating the generated code is impractical, which calls for the need for automatic metrics. The above mentioned benchmarks all provide test cases for execution-based evaluation, where metrics such as pass@k (Chen et al., 2021), n@k (Li et al., 2022b), test case aver-age (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and execution accuracy (Rajkumar et al., 2022) can be used. However, this approach has stringent requirements for the quality of test cases and can only evaluate executable code. For non-executable code, metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), andCodeBLEU (Ren et al., 2020) are used, while they can not precisely evaluate the correctness of the code. So far, there are many open challenges in designing metrics to evaluate various aspects of code, such as vulnerability, maintainability, clarity, execution complexity, and stability.","1.

Existing large language models for the NL2Code task are usually based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and are trained on a large-scale code related unlabelled corpus. For better code generation performance, most LLMs, no matter encoder-decoder or decoder-only models, employ the causal language modeling objective for training, which is to predict the token following a sequence of tokens. During inference, an LLM can tackle NL2Code problems in a zero-shot manner without fine-tuning its parameters. There are also studies employing few-shot (Austin et al., 2021) or in-context learning (Nijkamp et al., 2023) to further boost the performance. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of 27 representative LLMs for the NL2Code task. Details of each model are summarized in Table 1, where models vary in architecture, size, and accessibility. For better visualization, we present these models in chronological order in Figure 2, plotting the largest model sizes. One trend observed is that these large language models are consistently growing in size as the research field advances. Additionally, the decoder-only architecture is favoured for pre-trained models with larger sizes.

Early works, such as GPT-C (Svyatkovskiy et al., 2020), PyMT5 (Clement et al., 2020), and PLBART (Ahmad et al., 2021), have relatively small numbers of parameters and do not demonstrate strong capabilities in zero-shot code generation. Conversely, large-scale models such as GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021) and GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), despite their billion-level parameter scale, have been found to have limited power in the NL2Code task due to the small amount of code in their training corpus. Recently, a number of powerful LLMs have been proposed for NL2Code, such as Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), andPaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022), which possess massive parameter scales and high-quality training corpus with code. While they show surprisingly good performance on NL2Code, most of them are not readily accessible. At present, a number of excellent open-source models have also been proposed, including CodeParrot (Huggingface, 2021), PolyCoder , GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), and San-taCoder (Allal et al., 2023), which contribute to the thriving of LLMs for NL2Code. Besides, recent studies have proposed various approaches to address specific NL2Code scenarios. For example, JuPyT5 (Chandel et al., 2022a) is designed to work within Jupyter Notebooks, while ERNIE-Code (Chai et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), andBLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) are trained to support multiple natural or programming languages. Additionally, InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), FIM (Bavarian et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023) not only support left-to-right code prediction, but also allow for infilling arbitrary regions of code. As LLMs for NL2Code are evolving rapidly, we created a website to keep up-to-date with the latest advances by crowd-sourcing. Details of the website can be found in Appendix B.

These models are not only attractive in academia (Chen et al., 2021;Nijkamp et al., 2023;Li et al., 2022b), but also applied in real-world products to improve programming efficiency (Sobania et al., 2022a;Barke et al., 2023). One example is GitHub and OpenAI's Copilot, a programming assistance tool that utilizes Codex to provide realtime code suggestions. Other notable products include CodeGeeX 3 and CodeWhisperer 4 .

sent13: Early works, such as GPT-C (Svyatkovskiy et al., 2020), PyMT5 (Clement et al., 2020), and PLBART (Ahmad et al., 2021), have relatively small numbers of parameters and do not demonstrate strong capabilities in zero-shot code generation.
sent14: Conversely, large-scale models such as GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021) and GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), despite their billion-level parameter scale, have been found to have limited power in the NL2Code task due to the small amount of code in their training corpus.
sent15: Recently, a number of powerful LLMs have been proposed for NL2Code, such as Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), andPaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022), which possess massive parameter scales and high-quality training corpus with code.
sent16: While they show surprisingly good performance on NL2Code, most of them are not readily accessible.
sent17: At present, a number of excellent open-source models have also been proposed, including CodeParrot (Huggingface, 2021), PolyCoder , GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), and San-taCoder (Allal et al., 2023), which contribute to the thriving of LLMs for NL2Code.
sent18: Besides, recent studies have proposed various approaches to address specific NL2Code scenarios.
sent19: For example, JuPyT5 (Chandel et al., 2022a) is designed to work within Jupyter Notebooks, while ERNIE-Code (Chai et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), andBLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) are trained to support multiple natural or programming languages.
sent20: Additionally, InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), FIM (Bavarian et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023) not only support left-to-right code prediction, but also allow for infilling arbitrary regions of code.
sent21: As LLMs for NL2Code are evolving rapidly, we created a website to keep up-to-date with the latest advances by crowd-sourcing.
sent22: Details of the website can be found in Appendix B.These models are not only attractive in academia (Chen et al., 2021;Nijkamp et al., 2023;Li et al., 2022b), but also applied in real-world products to improve programming efficiency (Sobania et al., 2022a;Barke et al., 2023).
sent23: One example is GitHub and OpenAI's Copilot, a programming assistance tool that utilizes Codex to provide realtime code suggestions.
sent24: Other notable products include CodeGeeX 3 and CodeWhisperer 4 .
sent25: A summary of 10 products can be found in Appendix Table 5.
sent26: Recent studies (Sobania et al., 2022b;Pearce et al., 2022;Nguyen and Nadi, 2022) have shown that these products can provide helpful recommendations, while they also introduce minor bugs that can cause issues for users.
sent27: There is still room for improvement before LLMs can be fully practical and capable of coding like humans.","1. What is the NL2Code task? sent1

258740687,A Survey on Zero Pronoun Translation,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fa265a8ca46c9c0ad35d2c5b519a86e2a092dfe,Overview,26,"Early researchers have investigated several approaches for conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; Xiang et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2016a). Modeling ZPs for advanced NMT models, however, has received more attention, resulting in better performance in this field (Wang et al., 2018a;Tan et al., 2021;Hwang et al., 2021). Generally prior works fall into three categories: (1) Pipeline, where input sentences are labeled with ZPs using an external ZP recovery system and then fed into a standard MT model (Chung and Gildea, 2010;Wang et al., 2016a); (2) Implicit, where ZP phenomenon is implicitly resolved by modelling document-level contexts Ri et al., 2021); (3) Endto-End, where ZP prediction and translation are jointly learned in an end-to-end manner Tan et al., 2021).

Pipeline The pipeline method of ZPT borrows from that in pronoun translation (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010;Pradhan et al., 2012) due to the strong relevance between the two tasks. Chung and Gildea (2010) systematically examine the effects of empty category (EC) 9 on SMT with pattern-, CRF-and parsing-based methods. The results show that this can really improve the translation quality, even though the automatic prediction of EC is not highly accurate. Besides, Wang et al. (2016aWang et al. ( ,b, 2017b proposed to integrate neural-based ZP recovery with SMT systems, showing better performance on both ZP recovery and overall translation. When entering the era of NMT, ZP recovery is also employed as an external system. Assuming that no-pro-drop languages can benefit pro-drop ones, Ohtani et al. (2019) tagged the coreference information in the source language, and then encoded it using a graph-based encoder integrated with NMT model. Tan et al. (2019) recovered ZP in the source sentence via a BiLSTM-CRF model (Lample et al., 2016). Different from the conventional ZP recovery methods, the label is the corresponding translation of ZP around with special tokens. They then trained a NMT model on this modified data, letting the model learn the copy behaviors. Tan et al. (2021) used ZP detector to predict the ZP position and inserted a special token. Second, they used a attention-based ZP recovery model to recover the ZP word on the corresponding ZP position.

End-to-End Due the lack of training data on ZPT, a couple of studies pay attention to data augmentation. Sugiyama and Yoshinaga (2019) employed the back-translation on a context-aware NMT model to augment the training data. With the help of context, the pronoun in no-pronoun-drop language can be translated correctly into pronoundrop language. They also build a contrastive dataset to filter the pseudo data. Besides, Kimura et al.

(2019) investigated the selective standards in detail to filter the pseudo data. Ri et al. (2021) deleted the personal pronoun in the sentence to augment the training data. And they trained a classifier to keep the sentences that pronouns can be recovered without any context. About model architecture, Wang et al. (2018a) first proposed a reconstruction-based approach to reconstruct the ZP-annotated source sentence from the hidden states of either encoder or decoder, or both. The central idea behind is to guide the corresponding hidden states to embed the recalled source-side ZP information and subsequently to help the NMT model generate the missing pronouns with these enhanced hidden representations. Although this model achieved significant improvements, there nonetheless exist two drawbacks: 1) there is no interaction between the two separate reconstructors, which misses the opportunity to exploit useful relations between encoder and decoder representations; and 2) testing phase needs an external ZP prediction model and it only has an accuracy of 66% in F1-score, which propagates numerous errors to the translation model. Thus, Wang et al. (2018b) further proposed to improve the reconstruction-based model by using shared reconstructor and joint learning. Furthermore, relying on external ZP models in decoding makes these approaches unwieldy in practice, due to introducing more computation cost and complexity.

About learning objective, contrastive learning is often used to let the output more close to golden data while far away from negative samples. Yang et al. (2019b) proposed a contrastive learning to reduce the word omitted error. To construct the negative samples, they randomly dropped the word by considering its frequency or part-of-speech tag. Hwang et al. (2021) further considered the coreference information to construct the negative sample. According to the coreference information, they took place the antecedent in context with empty, mask or random token to get the negative samples. Besides, Jwalapuram et al. (2020) served the pronoun mistranslated output as the negative samples while golden sentences as positive sample. To get the negative samples, they aligned the word between model outputs and golden references to get the sentences with mistranslated pronoun.

Implicit Some works consider not just the ZPT issue but rather focus on the overall discourse problem. The document-level NMT models (Wang et al., 2017a;Werlen et al., 2018;Ma et al., 2020;Lopes et al., 2020) are expected to have strong capabilities in discourse modelling such as translation consistency and ZPT. Another method is the round-trip translation, which is commonly-used in automatic post-editing (APE) (Freitag et al., 2019), quality estimation (QE) (Moon et al., 2020) to correct of detect the translation errors. Voita et al. (2019) served this idea on context-aware NMT to correct the discourse error in the output. They employed the round-trip translation on monolingual data to get the parallel corpus in the target language.

Early researchers have investigated several approaches for conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; Xiang et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2016a).

In some studies, the stimuli are single words (Mitchell et al., 2008;Anderson et al., 2017) or sentences displayed on a screen (Pereira et al., 2018). In others, participants read longer stories (Wehbe et al., 2014a;Bhattasali et al., 2020;Nastase et al., 2021) or listened to speech or podcasts (Huth et al., 2016;Antonello et al., 2021). Table 1 lists publicly available datasets that have been used in the context of mapping language models to and from recordings of brain response. Differences between the datasets -the number of participants, the equipment, the experimental setup, pre-processing steps, and probabilistic corrections -should lead us to expect some variation in what researchers have concluded (Hollenstein et al., 2020).

3 How to predict brain activity?

In this section, we survey work in which neural responses are predicted from linguistic representations. Such work typically aims to shed light on how language functions in the brain. One of the earliest studies exploring the mapping between brain and language representations is by Mitchell et al. (2008), who trained a linear regression model on a set of word representations extracted from 60 nouns using 115 semantic features based on cooccurrence statistics, to predict the corresponding fMRI representations of the same nouns. They use pair-wise matching accuracy evaluation, extracting two words w and w ′ for evaluation, and showed that the predicted fMRI for a word w was closer to the real fMRI image for w than to the real fMRI image for w ′ , at above-chance levels. Mitchell et al. (2008) also report percentile rank results, ranking predicted fMRI images by similarity with the real image of w. We discuss how the metrics relate in §6.

The dataset of Mitchell et al. (2008)is also used by Murphy et al. (2012), who extract linguistic features from part-of-speech taggers, stemmers, and dependency parsers, showing that dependency parsers are the most successful in predicting brain activity. They also use leave-2-out pair-matching as their performance metric.

Later on, Wehbe et al. (2014a) moved on to predicting brain activation patterns for entire sentences rather than for isolated words. They recorded fMRI neural response measurements while participants read a chapter from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then extracted a set of 195 features for each word (ranging from semantic, syntactic properties to visual and discourse-level features) to train a comprehensive generative model that would then predict the time series of the fMRI activity observed when the participants read that passage. Leave-2-out pair-matching accuracy is used for evaluation. Huth et al. (2016), in contrast, use fMRI recordings of participants listening to spoken narrative stories, representing each word in the corpus as a 985-dimensional vector encoding semantic information driven by co-occurrence statistics. They train per-voxel linear regression models and evaluate their predicted per-word fMRI images by their per-voxel Pearson correlation with the real fMRI images, showing that 3-4 dimensions explained a significant amount of variance in the FMRI data. Wehbe et al. (2014b) are among the first to use neural language models, using recurrent models to compute contextualized embeddings, hidden state vectors of previous words, and word probabilities.  of participants reading Harry Potter, obtained in a follow-up study to Wehbe et al. (2014a). From the three sets of representations, they then train linear regression models to predict the MEG vectors corresponding to each word, and the regression models are then evaluated by computing pair-matching accuracy.

Similarly, Søgaard (2016) evaluates static word embeddings on the data from Wehbe et al. (2014a), learning linear transformation from word embeddings into an fMRI vector space. The predictions are evaluated through mean squared error (MSE).

Jain and Huth (2018) evaluate recurrent language models against the fMRI dataset from Huth et al. (2016). Their findings show that contextual language model representations align significantly better (to brain response) compared to static word embedding models. Their evaluation metric is the total sum of explained variance 1 Following this, Schwartz et al. (2019) use attention-based transformer language models for brain mapping. They finetune BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)to predict neural response measurements from the Harry Potter dataset, showing that the fine-tuned models have representations that encode more brain-activity-relevant language information than the non-finetuned models. They rely on pair-matching accuracy as their performance metric.

As in Søgaard (2016), Zhang et al. (2020) map static word embeddings into the vector space of the neural response measurements (fMRI). They introduce a new dataset of such measurements from subjects listening to natural stories. They rely on explained variance as their performance metric.

Toneva and Wehbe (2019) evaluate word and sequence embeddings from 4 recurrent and attention-based transformer language models, using the Harry Potter fMRI dataset. They evaluate models across layers, context lengths, and attention types, using pairwise matching accuracy as their performance metric. In a later study, Toneva et al. (2022a) induce compositional semantic representations of ""supra-word meaning"" which they then use to predict neural responses across regions of interest, evaluating their models using Pearson correlation.

Also using the Harry Potter data,  evaluate five models, one static and four contextualized, relying on a variant of representational similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008). The results suggest that models provide representations of local contexts that are well-aligned to neural measurements. However, as information from further away context is integrated by the models, representations become less aligned to neural measurements.

In a large-scale study, Schrimpf et al. (2021) examine the relationships between 43 diverse stateof-the-art neural network models (including embedding models, recurrent models, and transformers) across three datasets (two fMRI, one electrocardiography). They rely on a metric they term Brain Score which involves normalising the Pearson correlation by a noise ceiling. Their results show that transformer-based models perform better than recurrent or static models, and larger models perform better than smaller ones.

Similarly, in , the Schoffelen et al. (2019) fMRI and MEG datasets are used to compare a variety of transformer architectures. They study how architectural details, training settings, and the linguistic performance of these models independently account for the generation of brain correspondent representations. The results suggest that the better language models are at predicting words from context, the better their activations linearly map onto those of the brain. Antonello et al. (2021) evaluate three static and five attention-based transformer models, in combination with four fine-tuning tasks and two machine translation models. They train linear regression models to evaluate their word-level representations against a new fMRI dataset from participants listening to podcast stories. They find a low-dimensional structure in language representations that can predict brain responses. In a similar setting, Antonello and Huth (2022) examine why some features fit the brain data better arguing that the reason is that they capture various linguistic phenomena.

Reddy and Wehbe (2021) evaluate syntactic features in conjunction with BERT representations, finding that syntax explains additional variance in brain activity in various parts of the language system, even while controlling for complexity metrics that capture processing load.

In a series of studies Caucheteux et al. (2021Caucheteux et al. ( , 2022b investigate GPT2's activations in predicting brain signals using the Nastase et al. (2021) dataset. Their evaluation metric is Brain Score (Schrimpf et al., 2018). To determine which factors affect the brain encoding Pasquiou et al. (2022) examine the impact of test loss, training corpus, model architecture, and fine-tuning in various models using the Li et al. (2022) dataset. They evaluate model performance using Pearson Correlation.

Oota et al. (2022a) study the impact of context size in language models on how they align with neural response measurements. They use the Nastase et al. (2021) dataset and evaluate recurrent and attention-based transformer architectures. In a later study, Oota et al. (2022b) use the Pereira et al. (2018) dataset and evaluate BERTbase models (fine-tuned for various NLP tasks). They showed that neural response predictions from ridge regression with BERT-base models fine-tuned for coreference resolution, NER, and shallow syntactic parsing explained more variance for Pereira et al. (2018) response measurements. On the other hand, tasks such as paraphrase generation, summarization, and natural language inference led to better encoding performance for the Nastase et al. (2021) data (audio). Using the same dataset, in Oota et al. (2022c) it is shown that the presence of surface, syntactic, and semantic linguistic information is crucial for the alignment across all layers of the language model. They use pairwise matching accuracy and/or Pearson correlation as their performance metrics in these studies.

Aw and Toneva (2023) extract feature representations from four attention-based transformer models. They evaluate the impact of fine-tuning on the BookSum dataset (Kryscinski et al., 2021). All models are used to predict brain activity on the Harry Potter data. Pairwise matching accuracy and Pearson correlation are their performance metrics. Merlin and Toneva (2022) focus more narrowly on variants of GPT-2, showing that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are probably not because of the next-word prediction task or wordlevel semantics, but due to multi-word semantics. Their reported metric is Pearson correlation.

Intermediate summary The above studies differ in many respects. Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, 2 Pearson correlation (or Brain Score), mean squared error, and representational similarity analysis. Even studies that report the same performance metrics are not directly comparable because they often report on results on different datasets and use slightly different protocols, e.g., Murphy et al. (2012) and Wehbe et al. (2014b). Beinborn et al. (2023) compare various encoding experiments and receive very diverse results for different evaluation metrics. The diversity of metrics and data renders a direct comparison difficult. To remedy this, we consider how the metrics compare in §6.","1.

sent2: In some studies, the stimuli are single words (Mitchell et al., 2008;Anderson et al., 2017) or sentences displayed on a screen (Pereira et al., 2018).
sent3: In others, participants read longer stories (Wehbe et al., 2014a;Bhattasali et al., 2020;Nastase et al., 2021) or listened to speech or podcasts (Huth et al., 2016;Antonello et al., 2021).
sent4: Table 1 lists publicly available datasets that have been used in the context of mapping language models to and from recordings of brain response.
sent5: Differences between the datasets -the number of participants, the equipment, the experimental setup, pre-processing steps, and probabilistic corrections -should lead us to expect some variation in what researchers have concluded (Hollenstein et al., 2020).
sent6: 3 How to predict brain activity?
sent7: In this section, we survey work in which neural responses are predicted from linguistic representations.
sent8: Such work typically aims to shed light on how language functions in the brain.
sent9: One of the earliest studies exploring the mapping between brain and language representations is by Mitchell et al. (2008), who trained a linear regression model on a set of word representations extracted from 60 nouns using 115 semantic features based on cooccurrence statistics, to predict the corresponding fMRI representations of the same nouns.
sent10: They use pair-wise matching accuracy evaluation, extracting two words w and w ′ for evaluation, and showed that the predicted fMRI for a word w was closer to the real fMRI image for w than to the real fMRI image for w ′ , at above-chance levels.
sent11: Mitchell et al. (2008) also report percentile rank results, ranking predicted fMRI images by similarity with the real image of w. We discuss how the metrics relate in §6.
sent12: The dataset of Mitchell et al. (2008)is also used by Murphy et al. (2012), who extract linguistic features from part-of-speech taggers, stemmers, and dependency parsers, showing that dependency parsers are the most successful in predicting brain activity.
sent13: They also use leave-2-out pair-matching as their performance metric.Later on, Wehbe et al. (2014a) moved on to predicting brain activation patterns for entire sentences rather than for isolated words.
sent14: They recorded fMRI neural response measurements while participants read a chapter from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then extracted a set of 195 features for each word (ranging from semantic, syntactic properties to visual and discourse-level features) to train a comprehensive generative model that would then predict the time series of the fMRI activity observed when the participants read that passage.
sent15: Leave-2-out pair-matching accuracy is used for evaluation.
sent16: Huth et al. (2016), in contrast, use fMRI recordings of participants listening to spoken narrative stories, representing each word in the corpus as a 985-dimensional vector encoding semantic information driven by co-occurrence statistics.
sent17: They train per-voxel linear regression models and evaluate their predicted per-word fMRI images by their per-voxel Pearson correlation with the real fMRI images, showing that 3-4 dimensions explained a significant amount of variance in the FMRI data.
sent18: Wehbe et al. (2014b) are among the first to use neural language models, using recurrent models to compute contextualized embeddings, hidden state vectors of previous words, and word probabilities.
sent19: of participants reading Harry Potter, obtained in a follow-up study to Wehbe et al. (2014a).
sent20: From the three sets of representations, they then train linear regression models to predict the MEG vectors corresponding to each word, and the regression models are then evaluated by computing pair-matching accuracy.
sent21: Similarly, Søgaard (2016) evaluates static word embeddings on the data from Wehbe et al. (2014a), learning linear transformation from word embeddings into an fMRI vector space.

Pereira et al. (2018) introduce a decoder that predicts stimuli representation of semantic features given fMRI data.They introduce a novel dataset of neural responses aligned with annotation of concrete and abstract semantic categories (such as pleasure, ignorance, cooking etc.). They evaluate static word embeddings by applying ridge regression to predict per-word fMRI vectors. A separate regression model is trained per dimension, allowing for dimension-wise regularization. The model is evaluated in terms of pairwise matching accuracy, but also in terms of percentile rank, adapted to the decoding scenario.

Gauthier and Levy (2019) also train linear regression models which map from the response measurements in Pereira et al. (2018), but to representations of the same sentences produced by the BERT language model finetuned on different natural language understanding tasks. The regression models are evaluated using two metrics: mean squared error and average percentile rank. Their results show that fine-tuning with different NLU objectives leads to worse alignment and that, somewhat surprisingly, the only objective which does lead to better alignment is a scrambled language modeling task where the model is trained to predict scrambled sentences.

Minnema and Herbelot (2019) re-examine the work of Pereira et al. (2018) using various metrics (pairwise matching accuracy, percentile rank, cosine distance, R 2 , RSA), comparing decoder models (ridge regression, perceptron, and convolutional neural networks). 3 They show that positive results are only obtained using pairwise matching accuracy. Abdou et al. (2021) investigate whether aligning language models with brain recordings can be improved by biasing their attention with annotations from syntactic or semantic formalisms. They fine-tune the BERT models using several syntactosemantic formalisms and evaluate their alignment with brain activity measurements from the Wehbe et al. (2014a) and Pereira et al. (2018) datasets. Their results -obtained using Pearson correlation as performance metric -are positive for two in three formalisms. Zou et al. (2022) propose a new evaluation method for decoding, a so-called cross-modal cloze task. They generate the data for the task from the neural response measures in Mitchell et al. (2008) and Wehbe et al. (2014a). The task itself amounts to a cloze task in which the context is prefixed by the fMRI image of the masked word. They evaluate models using precision@k. Note how this task is considerably easier than linearly mapping from language model representations into fMRI images, and precision@k results therefore cannot be compared to those obtained in other settings. Their best precision@1 scores are around 0.3, but only marginally (0.03) better than a unimodal LM.

Finally, Pascual et al. (2022) try a more realistic setup by predicting language from fMRI scans of subjects not included in the training. They use the (Pereira et al., 2018) dataset and evaluate the regression models based on pairwise accuracy and precision@k (or top-k accuracy). They propose evaluating with direct classification as a more demanding setup to evaluate and understand current brain decoding models.

Intermediate summary Decoding studies also differ in many respects. Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, Pearson correlation, percentile rank, cosine distance, precision@k, and representational similarity analysis; and several datasets are used. Gauthier and Ivanova (2018) criticize the evaluation techniques of decoding studies and suggest adopting task and mechanism explicit models. It is of particular interest to our study that both Minnema and Herbelot (2019) only report positive results for pairwise matching accuracy compared to other metrics. This suggests pairwise matching accuracy is a less conservative metric (and maybe less reliable).","1.

sent14: Their results -obtained using Pearson correlation as performance metric -are positive for two in three formalisms.
sent15: Zou et al. (2022) propose a new evaluation method for decoding, a so-called cross-modal cloze task.
sent16: They generate the data for the task from the neural response measures in Mitchell et al. (2008) and Wehbe et al. (2014a).
sent17: The task itself amounts to a cloze task in which the context is prefixed by the fMRI image of the masked word.
sent18: They evaluate models using precision@k.
sent19: Note how this task is considerably easier than linearly mapping from language model representations into fMRI images, and precision@k results therefore cannot be compared to those obtained in other settings.
sent20: Their best precision@1 scores are around 0.3, but only marginally (0.03) better than a unimodal LM.
sent21: Finally, Pascual et al. (2022) try a more realistic setup by predicting language from fMRI scans of subjects not included in the training.
sent22: They use the (Pereira et al., 2018) dataset and evaluate the regression models based on pairwise accuracy and precision@k (or top-k accuracy).
sent23: They propose evaluating with direct classification as a more demanding setup to evaluate and understand current brain decoding models.
sent24: Intermediate summary Decoding studies also differ in many respects.
sent25: Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, Pearson correlation, percentile rank, cosine distance, precision@k, and representational similarity analysis; and several datasets are used.
sent26: Gauthier and Ivanova (2018) criticize the evaluation techniques of decoding studies and suggest adopting task and mechanism explicit models.
sent27: It is of particular interest to our study that both Minnema and Herbelot (2019) only report positive results for pairwise matching accuracy compared to other metrics.
sent28: This suggests pairwise matching accuracy is a less conservative metric (and maybe less reliable).","1. What is the goal of decoding models in predicting linguistic stimuli? sent1

259108815,Mapping Brains with Language Models: A Survey,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a92c82231c0ea7027ab20b25fe5f82565047aad7,Discussion,18,"Many studies, summarized above, aim to compare language model representations with neural response measurements using linear mapping mod-els. Our main reason to focus on linear mapping models is that they quantify the degree of structural similarity (isomorphism). Overall, results suggest that structural similarities between language models and neural responses exist. Furthermore, there is good evidence that alignment has correlated positively with model quality and model size, suggesting a certain level of convergence as language models improve.

What drives alignment? Is alignment driven by deep processing characteristics or by shallow textual characteristics? Classical candidates for shallow ones would be word length, frequency, regularity, and part of speech. Mitchell et al. (2008), for example, only controlled for part of speech. Some authors have presented results to suggest that alignments are driven by syntactic or semantic factors (Abdou et al., 2021;Reddy and Wehbe, 2021;Caucheteux et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2020), whereas others have claimed some similarities reflect semantic phenomena (Huth et al., 2016;Caucheteux et al., 2021). Others suggest that alignments reflect deeper similarities between model objectives and predictive processing in human brains (Schrimpf et al., 2018;Caucheteux et al., 2022a;Goldstein et al., 2021), but see Antonello and Huth (2022) for a critical discussion of such work.

Linguistically-transparent models that allow for a principled decomposition of a model's components into smaller linguistically meaningful units and models that move towards possible neurobiological implementations of neural computation are likely to be key for answering this question Ten Oever et al., 2022). Given the plethora of interpretability methods recently developed, however, we believe that even models which are not intrinsically interpretable can be useful toward this goal.

Do some models align better? Most studies observe that better and larger, contextual models align better with neural responses (Jain and Huth, 2018;. Other improvements include fine-tuning on specific tasks (Oota et al., 2022b;Aw and Toneva, 2023). Pasquiou et al. (2022) outline the impact of model training choices.

What metrics? The inconsistent use of performance metrics makes it hard to compare and interpret the results reported in the literature (Beinborn et al., 2023). We have shown that some metrics are perhaps too permissible to detect structural sim-ilarities between language models and neural responses. We have argued that precision@k is more conservative than most other metrics. Minnema and Herbelot (2019) have proposed using analogy scores. In the limit (given sufficient analogies), perfect analogical accuracy implies isomorphism (Garneau et al., 2021). So do perfect precision@1 and perfect RSA scores. We, therefore, propose giving priority to these performance metrics, not to conflate shallow processing characteristics with deeper, more semantic properties.

Meta-analysis? Proper meta-analysis is currently hindered by the use of different metrics, but we have taken steps to relate these.","1. Many studies, summarized above, aim to compare language model representations with neural response measurements using linear mapping mod-els.

Large language models are known to perform generally better and hold more knowledge (Brown et al., 2020;Roberts et al., 2020).However, the model's architecture and pre-training objectives are more decisive for knowledge retention than its size (Li et al., 2022a).For example, pre-training with the Salient Span Masking objective (Guu et al., 2020) helps PLMs to absorb more facts (Roberts et al., 2020;Cole et al., 2023).Similarly, Xiong et al. (2020) demonstrate that training the model to predict if the original entities in the text have been replaced with other entities is beneficial for fact retrieval.More generally, Ye et al. (2021) conclude that a masking strategy matching the downstream task, positively affects the performance on that task.

A larger pre-training corpus with an encoderonly model (Liu et al., 2020) leads to higher knowledge retention (Zhang et al., 2021), but with an encoder-decoder model (Lewis et al., 2020), a larger corpus negatively affects knowledge retention Wang et al. (2021a).Recency (Chiang et al., 2020) and frequency (Kandpal et al., 2023), i.e., when and how often the data is observed at training, are also essential for knowledge retention.

Larger models and more pre-training data can improve knowledge retention if combined with the right choices for architecture and pre-training objective(s).However, scaling might not be sufficient (Kandpal et al., 2023).Even though many works propose new architectures and pre-training objectives to increase factual knowledge retention in PLMs and their robustness to prompts (Févry et al., 2020;Hosseini et al., 2021;Sadeq et al., 2022;Whitehouse et al., 2022;Min et al., 2023;Zhong et al., 2023), this is a promising future work direction, as there is more room for improvement.","1.

Interpretability.Identifying where facts are stored and how they are retrieved is essential to adopt PLMs as trustworthy knowledge sources.Several approaches locate knowledge in PLMs (Wallat et al., 2020;Podkorytov et al., 2021;Alkhaldi et al., 2022;Dai et al., 2022;Meng et al., 2022a), with different conclusions depending on the architecture (e.g., knowledge is located in the middle layers of GPT-like models (Meng et al., 2022a), or in the upper layers in BERT-like models (Dai et al., 2022)).Another line of work focuses on the data aspect, showing the dependence of PLMs on word co-occurrences and positionally close words (Li et al., 2022b), or tracing back predictions to training data (Akyurek et al., 2022;Park et al., 2023).Knowing how PLMs retrieve facts remains challenging, but necessary to make PLMs transparent fact retrievers.The introduction of a fact tracing benchmark (Akyurek et al., 2022) opens the door for works in this direction.

Updating Knowledge.PLMs come with a fixed set of pre-trained parameters that encode knowledge about the world.As time passes, this knowledge becomes partially outdated.Hence, editing existing knowledge in PLMs and augmenting them with new knowledge is crucial for their use as knowledge bases (Zini and Awad, 2022).

One line of research locates the modules responsible for factual predictions and modifies these to update the corresponding facts (Dai et al., 2022;De Cao et al., 2021;Meng et al., 2022a).Other lines of research keep the original PLM unchanged, but augment it with additional parameters to induce the desired changes (Wang et al., 2021b;Lee et al., 2022), or encode facts with time stamps in PLMs to make them ""time-aware"" (Dhingra et al., 2022).

When updating facts in PLMs, it is crucial that only the targeted facts are affected and that these facts are retrievable using different paraphrases (De Cao et al., 2021;Hase et al., 2023).However, current methods for facts editing (Meng et al., 2022a(Meng et al., , 2023) ) still do not fulfill these requirements (Hoelscher-Obermaier et al., 2023).Methods that introduce additional parameters should be made more scalable (Jang et al., 2022b).","1.

(2019) prove that a transformer encoder (rather, a transformer encoder-decoder with a trivial decoder) without any position encoding recognizes MAJORITY; Merrill et al. (2022) prove the same for transformer encoders.
sent2: Bhattamishra et al. (2020a) experiment with training transformer encoders on some counter languages: DYCK-1, SHUFFLE-DYCK- for  ∈ {2, 4, 6}, -ary boolean expressions in prefix notation for  ∈ {3, 5}, {a  b  }, {a  b  c  }, {a  b  c  d  }, observing nearly perfect learning and generalization to longer lengths with masking and no positional encoding.
sent3: They also experiment with learning regular languages including the Tomita (1981) languages, PARITY, (aa) * , (abab) * , and DYCK-(1, ) for  ∈ {2, 3, 4, 12}, where they find that only the star-free languages of dot-depth 1 are learned and generalized well.
sent4: Delétang et al. (2023) study experimentally how well transformer encoders (and other networks) learn tasks at various levels of the Chomsky hierarchy, including generalization to longer strings.

sent7: As described above ( §4.3.3), the decoder is allowed to run for arbitrarily many time steps until an acceptance criterion is met.
sent8: Under these assumptions, transformer encoder-decoders can recognize any recursively enumerable language.
sent9: 2his result uses arbitrary precision, but as a corollary, Pérez et al. (2021) show that a  ()time-bounded Turing machine can be simulated in a transformer using  (log  ()) bits of precision.2023) study the ability of transformer decoders to simulate deterministic finite automata (DFAs), in the sense of computing not only the same acceptance decision but also the same state sequence.

• generation is defined using the KL divergence criterion in Eq. ( 5).
