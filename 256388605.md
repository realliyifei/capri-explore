Decision-making on childhood vaccination against COVID-19 by nurses in Cyprus: A cross-sectional online survey
10.1080/21645515.2023.2171674RESEARCH ARTICLE ABSTRACT


## Introduction

In early December 2019, COVID-19 was presented in Wuhan, China. 1 On the 30 th of January 2020, the World Health Organization announced a public health emergency of international concern and subsequently elevated it to a pandemic on the 11 th of March 2020. 2 To mitigate the virus' spread, many public health measures have been implemented worldwide, including but not limited to mandatory mask-wearing, physical distancing, washing hands regularly, and limiting social contact. 3 Vaccination is an important public health initiative and a critical step in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 Currently, seven vaccines received marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), with the first vaccine receiving conditional marketing authorization in December 2020 and the most recent obtaining marketing authorization in November 2022. [5][6][7] Healthcare workers have a key role in increasing vaccination acceptability, 8,9 so it is crucial to be vaccinated and promote vaccination. A rapid systematic review of healthcare personnel revealed that COVID-19 vaccine acceptance ranged from 27.7% to 77.3%. 10 Men, older individuals, physicians, past influenza vaccine records, and self-perceived risk were positive predictive factors, while worries about safety, efficacy, and effectiveness, and mistrust of the government were negative predictors. 10 In addition, it has been found that the key reasons for vaccine refusal among nurses and midwives in Cyprus were doubts about the vaccine's accelerated development and fear of side effects, whereas females, older people, and those with more years of work experience were more likely to get vaccinated. 11 When it comes to their children's or adolescents' vaccination compliance, parents are typically the decision-makers. Many studies have looked into parental attitudes and beliefs toward childhood vaccination, with a lack of knowledge being identified as a critical factor in parental decision-making about whether to accept or refuse childhood vaccination. 12 Physicians are a reliable source of information, 13,14 and recent studies in Cyprus and Greece found that around 90% of all mothers reported their pediatricians as the principal source of vaccination-related information. 14,15 Parental trust in new vaccines is also an important area. A recent study in Greece identified a large percentage of mothers as being neutral on the safety and effectiveness of new vaccines. 16 Many factors affect the acceptance of new vaccines. For instance, during the H1N1 pandemic, the fear of H1N1 illness, 17,18 prior seasonal influenza vaccination experience, 17 and parental educational level 18 were associated factors with H1N1 vaccine uptake in adults.

The parental decision to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 varies globally. According to a research study in the United Kingdom, 48.2% of parents or guardians would have their offspring (aged ≤18 months) vaccinated against COVID-19. 19 Moreover, another research study among Chinese factory workers found that 72.5% would likely vaccinate their children aged less than 18 years. 20 In addition, it has been reported that the majority of caregivers intend to accept the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available (before COVID-19 vaccine distribution), with specific factors (e.g., child's age, past influenza vaccination, gender, and worries about infection) linked with the intention to vaccinate their kids. 21 Vaccination knowledge, work-related factors, vaccinationrelated intentions, and behaviors may affect nurses' decisions to vaccinate their children. The COVID-19 vaccine is now available for children (≥5 years) in Cyprus and other countries 22,23 and from November 2022, COVID-19 vaccination is also offered to infants (≥6 months old) 24 however, little is known about parental willingness to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 in Cyprus. The purpose of the present study was thus to sub-analyze the same cohort used in our previous study 11 and to determine nurses' willingness to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 in Cyprus. The study was conducted before COVID-19 vaccine availability in Cyprus and before the announcement of the EMA recommendation for childhood COVID-19 vaccination approval. The time frame of this study also correlates with a considerable increase in daily cases and deaths in Cyprus and Europe. 25 Specifically, compared to the first week of October 2020, during the first week of December 2020, there were approximately 3 times more deaths and 15 times more confirmed cases in Cyprus. 26 Identifying the factors that influence parental willingness to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 is critical to improving the new vaccine's acceptance, especially during the particular time frame.


## Material and methods


## Study design

This manuscript is a sub-analysis of a cross-sectional online survey investigating willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination among nurses and midwives in Cyprus. 11 The present report was based on a subsample of 305 nurses with at least one child under the age of 18 years. In total, 437 midwives and nurses completed the online questionnaire, 11 and among them, we selected nurses who had at least one child under the age of 18 years old. The final sample size for the purposes of the present study was similar to the actual population of registered nurses among the five government-controlled districts of the Republic of Cyprus, and workplaces (public/private hospitals). 27 This study follows the guidelines for Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in epidemiology. 28


## Study population, sample recruitment and data collection

Nurses (either working in the public or private sector) providing inpatient, outpatient, or outreach services with direct patient contact with a child/children aged <18 years old were eligible. As a result of quarantine restrictions, imposed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a convenience sampling strategy was implemented. Data were gathered via an online self-administered survey between December 8 and 28 December 2020 (before COVID-19 vaccine availability in Cyprus). The survey was generated using Google Forms TM and distributed through instant messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Viber), social networking sites (e.g., LinkedIn), and social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram).


## Instrument and variables

The researchers designed an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire in Greek that included 28 closed-ended and multiple-choice questions related to sociodemographic characteristics, nurses' general vaccine knowledge, and vaccination against COVID-19. Marital status was recorded as never married, married/engaged, or separated/divorced/ widowed. Participants' educational level was classified into four groups: individuals who completed college, those who had a university degree, those who had a master's degree, and individuals with a PhD. Regarding the work-related factors, and the workplace as a public or private hospital.

Concerning the intentions and behaviors related to vaccination, participants were questioned on whether they had gotten a seasonal flu shot in the previous five years since vaccination is not mandatory for healthcare workers in Cyprus, 29 if they were informed of the vaccines recommended for healthcare personnel, if they had attended conferences, seminars, or other vaccination training programs in the last two years, and whether they recommend and promote vaccination in their workplace (recorded as "yes," "no" or "I am not sure").

To assess participants' vaccination knowledge, 12 general vaccine literacy questions (answers as "true," "false" and "I do not know") were used. If the question was answered correctly, a point was awarded; otherwise, zero points were assigned. We determined the participants' knowledge score by adding the points for each of the 12 questions.

Face validity was examined in a pilot study of 40 nurses (not included in the sample) for clarity and to identify any challenges that may have appeared during the collection of data. To assure sample access to representative answers, minor adjustments were implemented. The Cronbach's test for internal reliability yielded a p-value of 0.743.


## Ethical approval

This study was approved by the Cyprus National Bioethics Committee (CNBC) (ΕΕΒΚ ΕΠ 2020.01.255). Participants' consent was obtained prior to completing the questionnaire by answering a "Yes/No" question on an electronic informed consent form on the first page of the online questionnaire. Participants who did not provide consent were excluded. All participants were fully informed about the study's objectives and that the gathered information is strictly anonymous and confidential.


## Data analysis

For continuous variables with skewed distributions, characteristics are reported as median (q1, q3), while categorical variables are reported as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine normality.

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine whether there were any differences in the intention to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine and the skewed socio-demographic and work-related characteristics. Pearson's chi-square test was used to determine whether there were any differences between the intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 and categorical socio-demographic and work-related characteristics. Furthermore, the Kruskal-Wallis rank test was used to identify any differences between participants' sociodemographic and work-related characteristics and their vaccination knowledge score. The Spearman correlation test was used to examine the associations between knowledge score and skewed participants' sociodemographic and workrelated characteristics.

Logistic regression analyses were utilized to determine the relationship between nurses' intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 and vaccination knowledge after controlling for sociodemographic factors. Model 1 was the crude model, Model 2 was adjusted for age and gender, Model 3 was adjusted for socioeconomic variables such as educational level and marital status, and Model 4 was adjusted for demographic characteristics such as country and geographical area. Furthermore, a logistic regression model was used to determine the relationship between nurses' intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 and vaccination knowledge after the adjustment for work-related factors such as years of experience, job role, and workplace. Similarly, a logistic regression analysis was also used to examine the relationship between nurses' intention to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine with possible intentions and behaviors related to vaccination adjusting for age and gender and work-related factors.

Pearson's chi-square or Fisher exact test was used to identify any differences between vaccination knowledge and the categorical characteristics of the participants (i.e., gender, marital status, educational level, job role, and workplace). The Kruskal-Wallis rank test was used to determine whether there were any differences between vaccination knowledge and the participants' non-normal continuous characteristics. The statistical significance level was set at 0.05 for all statistical hypotheses. The statistical software STATA 14.0 was used for the statistical analysis (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).


## Results


## Participants' characteristics

A total of 305 nurses with at least one child younger than 18 years old were included in this study. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic and work-related characteristics of the respondents. The median age of the participants was 36 (q1 = 31, q3 = 43) years old, 68.1% (n = 207) were female, 97% (n = 295) were from Cyprus, and the majority (n = 128, 44.4%) were from Nicosia. Moreover, 85.2% (n = 260) were married/in cohabitation, and 54.5% (n = 165) had only Differences between the characteristics of participants were examined with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 2 Differences between the characteristics of participants were examined with chi squared test. 3 Differences between the characteristics of participants were examined with Fisher's exact test of independence. 4 Differences between the characteristics of participants were examined with Spearman correlation test. 5 Differences between the characteristics of participants were examined with Kruskal-Wallis rank test; Bold indicate statistically significant associations at P < .05.

earned a bachelor's degree. Also, the majority of participants worked in the public sector (n = 239, 79.4%), with the median years of experience at 12 years (q1 = 7, q3 = 20).


## Intention to accept childhood vaccination against COVID-19 and demographics, socio-economic and work-related characteristics

We found that 15.2% of nurses had the intention of vaccinating their children against COVID-19. We observed that individuals who intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 were slightly older (median = 40 years old, IQR = 31-45) than those with no intention to accept or those who were undecided (median = 35 years old, IQR = 31-42) (p = .037) ( Table 1). Individuals who intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 had significantly more years of experience (median = 16.5, IQR = 8-22) than those who refused or were undecided (median = 12, IQR = 7-19) (p = .039).   2 Differences between the characteristics of participants were examined with chi 2 test of independence. 3 Differences between the characteristics of participants were examined with Fisher's exact test of independence; Bold indicate statistically significant associations at P < .05.


## Intention to accept childhood vaccination against COVID-19 and vaccination-related intentions and behaviors


## Intention to accept childhood vaccination against COVID-19 and vaccination knowledge

The median knowledge score was 9 (1 st quartile = 8, 3 rd quartile = 10) which indicates that the majority of participants have an adequate vaccination knowledge level. Specifically, 67.9% (n = 207) had a high vaccination knowledge level, 30.8% (n = 94) had a moderate vaccination knowledge level, and only 1.3% (n = 4) had a low vaccination knowledge level. Figure 1 shows the percentages of correct and incorrect answers to the 12 knowledge items. Table S1 shows vaccination knowledge according to age, gender, marital status, and level of education. Regarding age, we found a statistically significant association for the knowledge item "Flu is caused by bacteria" (p < .001). Individuals who answered correctly were significantly older (median = 37 years old, IQR = 32-43) compared to those who answered incorrectly or did not know (median = 32.5 years old, IQR = 29-35.5). We discovered statistically significant associations between the item "There is a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer" (p < .01) and the variables of gender and marital status. The majority of those who answered correctly (87.0%, n = 254) the item "There is a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer" were married/in cohabitation, while the corresponding percentages among those who answered incorrectly or were undecided was 54.5% (n = 6) (p = .016). Regarding the educational level, we found a statistically significant association for the item "Vaccination increases the incidence of allergies" (p = .015). Specifically, among those who answered incorrectly or were undecided, the majority did not obtain a master's degree or a PhD (61.6%, p = 90).

In Table S2, vaccination knowledge is presented by workplace, and years of experience. Regarding the workplace and years of experience, we discovered statistically significant associations for the knowledge items "Flu is caused by bacteria" and "The measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine is associated with autism."

As reported by the logistic regression analysis, nurses' vaccination knowledge is related to their intention to get their children vaccinated against COVID-19. We discovered that parents with higher vaccination knowledge were more likely to accept the childhood vaccination against COVID-19 (Table  S3, Model 1, OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.08-1.68). The association remained statistically significant even after controlling for age and gender ( . In all regression models, we discovered that the possibility of embracing the childhood vaccination against COVID-19 increases with age. We also found that females (Table S3, Model 4, OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.95) and married/cohabitating participants were less likely than unmarried participants to accept the vaccination (Table S3, Model 4, OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07-0.72).

After controlling for work-related variables, we found that parents with higher vaccination knowledge were more likely to accept the childhood vaccination against COVID-19 (Table S4, OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.06-1.66). Moreover, we discovered that as the number of years of nursing experience increases, so does the odds of accepting the childhood vaccination against COVID-19 (Table S4, OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11).

We found no statistically significant association between participants' intention to accept the childhood vaccination against COVID-19 and vaccination knowledge in the logistic regression model (Table S5, OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.92-1.46). We observed that nurses who worked in a private hospital, had a higher probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccination for their children (Table S5, OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.09-6.99) compared to those who worked in a public hospital. In addition, participants who had received a seasonal flu shot in the previous five years were more likely to accept the childhood vaccination against COVID-19 compared to those who did not (Table S5, OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.15-5.54). Also, we found that nurses who obtained the vaccines recommended for healthcare professionals had significantly higher odds of accepting the childhood vaccination against COVID-19 compared to those who did not (Table S5, OR = 11.2, 95% CI: 2.53-47.0).


## Discussion

The present sub-analysis of the same cohort used in our previous study demonstrated that only a small percentage of nurses (15.2%) intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Nurses with considerably high vaccination knowledge were more likely to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, older age, increased years of working experience, receiving a seasonal flu shot in the last five years, and receiving the vaccines recommended for healthcare personnel were associated with the acceptance of childhood vaccination against COVID-19.

To date, there are only few studies that have investigated nurses' intentions of accepting the childhood vaccination against COVID-19. Our results are comparable but not in complete agreement with another online survey conducted during the same period among Greek and Cypriot healthcare professionals. 30 Specifically, it has been reported that almost 50% of Greek and Cypriot healthcare personnel intended to vaccinate their children (Greece; 64.4%, Republic of Cyprus; 34.9%). In addition, a previous online survey among Chinese parents who were doctors and nurses reported that 44.5% would likely or very likely to vaccinate their children (≤18 years old) with the COVID-19 vaccine in the next six months. 31 However, those studies included a broad spectrum of healthcare professionals, while our study focused only on nurses with direct contact with patients. Moreover, previous epidemiological studies that investigated the parental acceptability of childhood vaccination against COVID-19 among different professionals identified a high acceptance. 20,21 Specifically, it has been reported that factory workers (72.5%) 20 and caregivers (66.7%) 21 were more likely to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Likewise, British parents or guardians were willing (48.2%) to vaccinate their children. 19 In addition, a recent research study of caregivers in 12 emergency units in the United States, Canada, and Israel, which was conducted in 2 phases (I: during the peak of the pandemic/March-May 2020, II: after COVID-19 vaccine availability for adults through emergency authorization in all three countries/December 2020-March 2021) revealed that fewer caregivers would vaccinate their children against COVID-19 when the vaccine became available for adults compared to their responses during the pandemic's peak. 32 We also reported that older nurses had a greater intention to accept the childhood vaccination against COVID-19. Our findings are in accordance with the finding that older healthcare professionals were more likely than younger healthcare professionals to accept the COVID-19 vaccination for themselves. Specifically, older age was found to be a positive predictor of vaccine acceptance among healthcare professionals in Cyprus and Greece, 30 French healthcare workers, 33 and Cypriot nurses and midwives. 11 Moreover, it has been reported that parents who had older children were predisposed to vaccinate their children. 21 Furthermore, it has been found that older caregivers who follow the childhood vaccination schedules are more likely to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine. 32 More years of experience in the workforce was linked with nurses' acceptance of the childhood vaccination against COVID-19. Hence, we can assume that older and more experienced nursing staff may have been exposed to vaccinationrelated information and are therefore willing to vaccinate their children. Furthermore, nurses who have had the seasonal flu in the last five years are more likely to accept the childhood vaccination against COVID-19. Similarly, another research study revealed an association between history of influenza vaccination and intention to vaccinate their children. 21 Moreover, it has been reported that among US parents and guardians (n = 2164) of children aged 6 months to 5 years old, 21% of those whose children did not receive the influenza vaccine last year and 39% of those who did, were more likely to have their children receive the influenza vaccine during the current year. 34 Our study reported that participants with a high level of vaccination knowledge were more likely to accept the childhood vaccination against COVID-19. A high level of general vaccination knowledge was also associated with nurses' and midwives' positive COVID-19 vaccination intentions in Cyprus. 35 Most nurses who participated in the study had an adequate level of vaccination knowledge, and thus are quite informed about vaccination. However, it has been reported that nurses can communicate efficiently with different groups of parents and address any vaccination-related concerns after adequate training. 36 Therefore, public health decision-makers may need to develop educational programs aiming to improve vaccination knowledge among nurses, as well and other healthcare professionals. Since nurses are part of the healthcare professionals who contribute to encouraging vaccination acceptability, 37 the improvement of their vaccination knowledge could potentially improve the COVID-19 vaccine uptake for their children. Nurses play an important role in vaccination programs and practices; therefore, professional conversations are essential for increasing vaccination rates. 36 Our findings have several implications. The uptake of childhood vaccination against COVID-19 is crucial for mitigating pandemic outcomes and preventing the development of novel virus variants such as omicron and potentially more lethal variants in the future. COVID-19 vaccines were only approved for use in adults at the time this study was conducted; however, the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 was approved for use in children aged 5-11 years old 38 and the EMA currently recommends approval of two COVID-19 vaccines (Comirnaty and Spikevax) for children aged 6 months or older. 39 As we mentioned before, nurses represent a trusted source of vaccinationrelated information and usually influence the vaccination acceptance of their families and fellow citizens. Therefore, the high rate of refusal of the childhood vaccine against COVID-19 among nurses may impact the community's uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings highlight the significance of previous vaccination-related knowledge in childhood COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among Cypriot nurses. Recent research studies identified nurses in Cyprus as a COVID-19 vaccine-hesitant group. 11,30 Our results indicate a link between vaccination knowledge and nurses' intentions to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, even before a COVID-19 vaccine was approved for use in children. However, further studies are needed to evaluate nurses' intention to vaccinate their children after the EMA's approval of childhood COVID-19 vaccination and potential different responses based on vaccine doses. 40 Besides vaccination knowledge, participants' history of vaccination is also linked with intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Nursing organizations and public health officials could develop educational campaigns and vaccination-related training to promote vaccination uptake and, consequently, minimize public health risks.


## Limitations

This study has some limitations. Firstly, the associations between vaccination knowledge and nurses' acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine for their children cannot be generalized to other healthcare professionals or other vaccines. Secondly, due to the cross-sectional design, only associations between the groups of interest could be evaluated rather than causal links. Thirdly, self-reported data can introduce information bias. Fourthly, the collection of data was done through a convenient online survey, reducing the study's representativeness. Fifthly, we cannot rule out the potential that those without access to technology are underrepresented in our sample, while specific subgroups may be oversampled, decreasing the overall reliability of the study. Because of the study design, we were unable to calculate the response rate for our study, as we could not find out how many people saw the survey or its links but did not participate. In addition, we have not collected information on prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could have an impact on nurses' acceptance of childhood vaccination against COVID-19. Finally, this study included a range of children from different ages (under 18 years old), but we did not investigate any differences in parental attitudes depending on the children's age.


## Conclusions

This is the first study in Cyprus to investigate the relationship between nurses' vaccination knowledge and acceptance of childhood vaccination against COVID-19. This study revealed a link between the nurses' intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 and their knowledge of vaccinations. Moreover, specific characteristics of the participants, such as older age, more years of experience, previous vaccination for seasonal flu, and receiving the recommended vaccination for healthcare personnel, were associated with a greater likelihood of accepting the childhood vaccination against COVID-19.

## Table 2
2presents responders' intentions to accept the childhood vaccination against COVID-19 by different vaccination-related intentions and behaviors. The majority of nurses had 
not received or were not sure if they had received a seasonal flu 
shot in the previous five years (n = 185, 60.9%) (Table 2). 
Among those who received a seasonal flu, 27.1% (n = 32) 
intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, while 
72.9% (n = 86) refused or were undecided (p < .001). On the 
other hand, a large proportion of participants (n = 191, 63.0%) 
received the vaccines recommended for healthcare personnel. 
More specifically, among those who received the recom-
mended vaccines for healthcare personnel, 23.2% (n = 44) 
intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, while 
the corresponding percentage among those who did not 
receive the recommended vaccines for healthcare personnel 
or were not sure was only 1.8% (p < .001). We reported that 
22.8% of the individuals who were vaccinated at their work-
place had the intention to vaccinate their children, while the 
percentage among those who were not vaccinated at their 
workplace was 8.3% (p < .001). Among those who were aware
