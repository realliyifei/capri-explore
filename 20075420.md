## Introduction

In recent years, due to the progress of modernization and rapid changes of social systems, in urban society, women's role has changed significantly, accounting for a significant proportion of the total labor forces in society, who, like men, are under the same evaluation criteria as well as the same pressure, becoming the backbone of the social development.Women are no longer as in the past, but gradually play an increasingly important role in society, and also bear various conflicts and pressures.

The study of professional women started relatively later and less in China.The research is targeted at the relationship between occupational burnout, stress and job satisfaction, and focuses on quantitative research, less qualitative one.Based on the data from the World Bank, about 64% of Chinese women are in the workplace, ranking second to none in the top 10 largest economies in the world.Last year, about 52% of 7 million college graduates in China are women.There is no doubt that pressure on women is also growing, so research on occupational stress is in desperate demand.As women's role in society will affect family stability, thereby affecting social stability, the study of women's pressure has very important value of society and times.

The investigation on the influencing factors and countermeasures of female occupational stresses could provide a more effective way of pressure relief for the majority of women, improve their work efficiency and better serve society.

## Relationship between Age and Stress

The age was concentrated between 20 and 50.As Figure 1: It showed that the age between 20 and 25 suffered minimum stress, possibly because women at this age basically were just graduated from college, so they were full of curiosity to work and life, and assigned with easy work; women from 25 to 35 suffered the greatest stress, because most of them have married, and facing multiple pressure from marriage, family and career, they need stabilize their marriage and their family within this period and lay solid foundation for their career, thus their pressure were largest from various aspects; women over 35 years were comparatively in peace, because they have a relatively stable career and family.

Nurse belongs to professional technicians with big intensity of work, big career risk and low social status, so they have to work in high-concentrated attention and high-tensed, while their income fails to be in proportion to their workload.Additionally, this profession determines that nurses have narrowed range of career.Furthermore, it is very common for them to work overtime, which further increase their pressure.The profession of teachers is relatively stable.As teachers deal with students, there is rare intrigue; besides, this profession makes teachers have summer vacation, which is conducive for them teachers to better organize their work and life, and relax themselves.For ordinary workers, they are from the grass-roots level, whose work is single and share simple interpersonal relationship, so they have small stress.

## Relationship between Education and Stress

Educational level would affect the stress and way of coping.In this survey, the surveyed groups had the education background of below junior college, junior college, undergraduate and master, as shown in Figure 5: Through above comparison, it could be concluded that education determines the level of knowledge and conflicts in the work.The survey results showed that workers with and below junior college took relatively common simple work, whose ability was well matched with their work, so they had less stress.Most undergraduates suffered huge pressures because their abilities failed to meet their demand in the pursuit of their career, so the current work was not their ideal one.Graduate worked in middle or high management level in a company, but they were critical to their work and it was hard for them to cope with interpersonal relationship.


## Relationship between Way of Release and Pressure

On the whole, the way of coping stress for occupational women shows mixing features, and most of them choose active way.Talk is the most common way for female workers to cope with stress.When feeling stressful, they will turn to friends, not only helpful in timely solving their problems but also conductive to reduce the negative effects from stress.The second is sleep and sports, which facilitates emotional persuasion and pressure release.The third is reading, which is an effective way to release stress.
