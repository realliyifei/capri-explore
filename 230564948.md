Volume 8, Issue 1, 86-132. 31.53% cholesterol transport 9.91% protein-lipid complex subunit organization 9.91% positive regulation of supramolecular fiber organization 8.11% muscle cell proliferation 6.31% regulation of peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation 5.41% regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to hypoxia 3.60% regulation of cell size 3.60% blood vessel endothelial cell migration 2.70% positive regulation of growth 2.70% negative regulation of immune response 1.80% glial cell differentiation 1 Note: The figure shows the enriched Cluster 1, derived from the initial selection of genes. Cluster 1 depicts the interacting genes and the type of interaction as shown in the figure legend. The Bar Chart associated with cluster 1 reports the percentage of genes belonging to a specific biological process (from Gene Ontology database) included in the pathway under analysis. It also shows the associations levels of biological processes with the cluster under analysis. The pie chart shows the overall degree of association of main biological processes involved with the cluster under investigation. To note, both the bar and pie chart report the top 25 biological processes. The table summarizes the details regarding the pathway analysis and shows all of the associated biological processes linked with the cluster under investigation. The figure shows the enriched Cluster 2, derived from the initial selection of genes, after exclusion of the genes involved in cluster 1. Cluster 2 depicts the interacting genes and the type of interaction as shown in the figure legend. The Bar Chart associated with cluster 2 reports the percentage of genes belonging to a specific biological process (from Gene Ontology database) included in the pathway under analysis. It also shows the associations levels of biological processes with the cluster under analysis. The pie chart shows the overall degree of association of main biological processes involved with the cluster under investigation. Cluster 2 genes seems to be mainly implicated with fat regulative processes. To note GO:0045599 -negative regulation of fat cell differentiation is a sub process of GO:0045598 -regulation of fat cell differentiation. Only main biological processes are represented in the pie chart. The table summarizes the details regarding the pathway analysis and shows all of the associated biological processes linked with the cluster under investigation.

AIMS NeuroscienceVolume 8, Issue 1, 86-132. The figure shows the enriched Cluster 3, derived from the initial selection of genes, after exclusion of previous clusters. Cluster 3 depicts the interacting genes and the type of interaction as shown in the figure legend. The Bar Chart associated with cluster 3 reports the percentage of genes belonging to a specific biological process (from Gene Ontology database) included in the pathway under analysis. It also shows the associations levels of biological processes with the cluster under analysis. The pie chart shows the overall degree of association of main biological processes involved with the cluster under investigation. The table summarizes the details regarding the pathway analysis and shows all of the associated biological processes linked with the cluster under investigation.

overall summary of the biological processes associated (p <0.05 with Bonferroni step down correction) with the clusters enriched from the initial list of genes (see Table1). Enrichment was based on STRING database (STRING-ACTIONS_v10.5) while pathway recognition used Gene Ontology Database (GO_BiologicalProcess-EBI-UniProt-GOA). Both analyses were performed on Cytoscape software [22], through ClueGO and CluePedia plugins [23Supplementary Figure 1.
