Cloud Computing is the most growing paradigm for delivering computational resources as a service over the internet. By 2018, many different enterprises have adopted this utility-based computing for reducing the operational and capital expenditure of building their infrastructure network, buying software licenses, hiring IT teams and other requirements. With this unlimited growth of using cloud services and the multi-tenancy nature of sharing cloud service instance between different consumers and enterprises, securing accessing to the data of the cloud became a major issue. Traditional authentication techniques and credentials does not provide enough security against the modern means of attacks. So, new biometric-based authentication techniques have been discovered to overcome the loop holes. Here we present a comprehensive survey on the existing user's authentication techniques especially biometric-based techniques used for accessing cloud data.
