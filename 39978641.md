We analyze the wavelength-dependent variability of a sample of spectroscopically confirmed active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected from near-UV (NUV ) variable sources in the GALEX Time Domain Survey that have a large amplitude of optical variability (difference-flux S/N > 3) in the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS). By matching GALEX and PS1 epochs in 5 bands (NUV , g P1 , r P1 , i P1 , z P1 ) in time, and taking their flux difference, we create co-temporal difference-flux spectral energy distributions (∆ f SEDs) using two chosen epochs for each of the 23 objects in our sample on timescales of about a year.We confirm the "bluer-when-brighter" trend reported in previous studies, and measure a median spectral index of the ∆ f SEDs of α λ = 2.1 that is consistent with an accretion disk spectrum. We further fit the ∆ f SEDs of each source with a standard accretion disk model in which the accretion rate changes from one epoch to the other. In our sample, 17 out of 23 (∼74%) sources are well described by this variable accretion-rate disk model, with a median average characteristic disk temperatureT * of 1.2 × 10 5 K that is consistent with the temperatures expected given the distribution of accretion rates and black hole masses inferred for the sample. Our analysis also shows that the variable accretion rate model is a better fit to the ∆ f SEDs than a simple power law.

## INTRODUCTION

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to vary across the observable electromagnetic spectrum on timescales ranging from seconds to years. Large time-domain surveys have confirmed variability as a ubiquitous characteristic of AGN (e.g. Vanden Berk et al. 2004;Wilhite et al. 2005), ruling out models involving extrinsic factors such as gravitational microlensing, star collisions or multiple supernovae or starbursts near the nucleus (Kokubo 2015, and references therein). In particular, the origin of UV/optical variability is of great interest for its connection to the AGN central engine, since the UV/optical continuum is thought to arise directly from the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole.

A well-established characteristic of AGN UV/optical variability is the "bluer-when-brighter" trend, in which the source is bluer in the bright state than in the faint state (Vanden Berk et al. 2004;Wilhite et al. 2005;Schmidt et al. 2012). (Although a reverse trend was observed for low-luminosity AGN in Heinis et al. (2016)). However, the interpretation of the "bluer-when-brighter" trend is still under debate. Whether or not the intrinsic AGN color becomes bluer when it brightens, or if the red color in a low state is caused by contamination from a non-variable component (e.g., host galaxy flux) (Winkler et al. 1992), cannot be distinguished due to the difficulties of separating host galaxy light from the AGN. Kelly et al. (2009) found that the optical variability of an AGN is well described by a damped random walk (DRW) process, with model-fit timescales that are consistent with the thermal timescale of an accretion disk. A similar conclusion was reached by MacLeod et al. (2010) with a sample of ∼9000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in SDSS Stripe 82. Furthermore, MacLeod et al. (2010) found that the variability amplitude was anti-correlated with Eddington ratio, implying that the mechanism driving the optical variability was related to the accretion disk.

Several prevailing models for the origin of UV/optical variability in the AGN accretion disk include thermal reprocessing of X-ray emission (Krolik et al. 1991), changes in the mass accretion rate (e.g. Pereyra et al. 2006;Li & Cao 2008), and an extremely inhomogeneous accretion disk (Dexter & Agol 2011;Ruan et al. 2014). In an effort to examine these models, several studies have been carried out. For example, Ruan et al. (2014) found that a relative spectral variability composite spectrum constructed from SDSS quasars is better fit with an inhomogeneous disk model consisting of multiple zones undergoing independent temperature fluctuations, than simply changes in a steady-state mass accretion rate. While the localized temperature fluctuations may arise from magnetorotational instabilities (MRI) in an accretion flow (see discussions in Hirose et al. 2009;Janiuk & Misra 2012;Jiang et al. 2013), it has also been pointed out by Kokubo (2015) that the inhomogeneous disk model predicts a weak interband correlation, which is contradictory to what is often ob-served in the SDSS quasar light curves. Kokubo (2015) attributed the successful fitting result in Ruan et al. (2014) to the use of a composite difference spectrum, in which the superposition of localized flares at different radii smears out the inter-band flux-flux correlation in individual quasars.

On the other hand, Pereyra et al. (2006, hereafter P06) presented the first successful result of fitting a composite difference spectrum of SDSS quasars to a standard thin disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) with changes in accretion rate from one epoch to the next. Recently, many works that try to explain AGN variability have also reached conclusions that are supportive of this variable accretion rate model (Li & Cao 2008;Sakata et al. 2011). The model suggests that the "bluer when brighter" trend is caused by intrinsic AGN spectral hardening. The same conclusion was reached in Wilhite et al. (2005), where they found steeper spectral index in the composite flux difference spectrum than that in the composite spectrum. Despite the elegance of this model, there is a discrepancy between the AGN UV-optical variability timescale and the sound crossing and the viscous timescales (by a factor of 10 3 , see discussion in § 6.3) of the accretion disk. Furthermore, Schmidt et al. (2012); Kokubo et al. (2014) reported that on the timescales of years, characteristic optical color variability in individual SDSS stripe 82 quasars is larger than the color variability predicted by a steady-state accretion disk with a varying accretion rate.

In this paper we continue the investigation of the origin of UV/optical variability in quasars with several improvements. We apply the variable accretion rate model (P06) to the difference-flux spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of individual quasars instead of using a composite quasar difference spectrum, and over a wavelength range broader than previous optical studies (≈ 1700 − 9000 in observer's frame) thanks to the nearly simultaneous near-UV (NUV ) observations from GALEX. The sample of AGNs and quasars investigated in this paper is selected from NUV-variability from the GALEX Time Domain Survey (TDS) and is analyzed using broad-band GALEX NUV and Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS) optical griz photometric data. In § 2, we describe the sample selection and the spectroscopic data used in this paper. We describe details of the P06 model in § 3. The creation of ∆ f SEDs, the spectral fitting procedures, and the derivation of fundamental AGN parameters are detailed in Fig. 4.1. We present our result in § 5. The implications of the results are discussed in § 6.


## SAMPLE SELECTION AND DATA REDUCTION

Throughout the analysis in this paper, we define an AGN as an optical stochastic variable source with extended host morphology, while quasars are defined as optical point sources with the following colors (Gezari et al. 2013).
u − g < 0.7 (1) −0.1 < g − r < 1.0
The optical morphology classification and colors are obtained from CFHT u band and the PS1 deep stack catalog (griz) in Heinis et al. (2016). The classification of stochastic variablility was carried out in Kumar et al. (2015) by comparing the goodness of fit of the light curves to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a general version of the DRW, and the light curve shapes characteristic of supernovae.

We cross-match the GALEX TDS UV-variable source cat-alog with the PS1 transient alert database with a search radius of 2 ′′ to obtain a sample of 335 UV and optical variable sources. For the analysis, we select a subsample of 24 large-amplitude optically variable sources with a differenceflux signal-to-noise (S/N) > 3 in the g band, for all of which we have spectra. All but one source in this subsample are spectroscopically classified as active galaxies, with 11 classified as AGN and 12 classified as quasars using our definitions described above. Spectroscopy shows that the exception is a normal galaxy with unusual UV variability (see § 6.2 for discussion).

2.1. GALEX TDS GALEX TDS (Gezari et al. 2013) covered ∼40 deg 2 of the sky and detected over 1000 UV variable sources with observations that span a 3-year baseline with a cadence of 2 days. GALEX TDS fields were designed to monitor 6 out of 10 PS1 MDS fields, with 7 GALEX TDS pointings at a time to cover the 8 deg 2 field of view of PS1. The typical exposure time per epoch is 1.5 ks (or a 5σ point-source limit of m AB ∼ 23.3 mag). The GALEX far-UV (FUV) detector became non-operational during the time of the full survey, and so only near-UV (NUV ) data is available for analysis.

Sources were classified as NUV variable in the GALEX TDS catalog if they have at least one epoch in which |m k − m| > 5σ(m, k) (Gezari et al. 2013), where m k is the magnitude of epoch k andm is calculated only from epochs that have a magnitude above the detection limit of that epoch. The variable sources were then classified using a combination of optical host colors and morphology, UV light curves, and matches to archival X-ray and spectroscopy catalogs. The final sample of 1078 NUV variable sources consists of 62% active galaxies (AGN and quasars), 10% variable stars (RR Lyrae, M dwarfs, and cataclysmic variables), and the rest are sources without classification (generally without spectra).


### PS1 MDS

The Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS) surveyed 10 spatially separated fields, each with a 8 deg 2 field of view, with a set of 5 broadband filters: g P1 , r P1 , i P1 , z P1 , y P1 (Kaiser et al. 2010). The average cadence was 6 epochs in 10 days with a 5σ depth of m AB ∼23.1 mag, 23.3 mag, 23.2 mag, 22.8 mag in g P1 , r P1 , i P1 , and z P1 , respectively (Rest et al. 2014). Each night, 5 MD fields were observed with a 3-day staggered cadence in each filter with the following pattern: g P1 and r P1 in the same night (dark time), followed by i P1 and z P1 on the subsequent second and third night, respectively. During the week of the full moon, the y P1 band was observed exclusively. We do not use the y P1 band in our analysis due to the large time interval between y P1 and the other bands.

We use data from the transient alert system of PS1 MDS that is designed to detect transient events. The images taken in PS1 MDS are detrended by the Image Processing Pipeline (IPP) (Magnier 2006). Typically 8 dithered images are taken per filter and stacked in a given night. Image subtraction of a template created from observations of two earlier epochs from the nightly stacked image is performed with the photpipe pipeline (Rest et al. 2005). The system determines the spatially varying convolution kernel in a robust way before performing a subtraction of the two images. A transient detection is flagged if it shows positive detections with a signalto-noise ratio (S/N) ≥4 in at least three griz P1 images within a time window of 10 days. Note that most previous studies of AGN variability have used samples of point-like quasars but avoided AGN with resolved galaxy hosts because the host galaxy light is hard to separate from the AGN light. With difference imaging, the non-variable component can be removed effectively, leaving only the variable component of the AGN.


### Optical spectra

We gather spectra for all the objects in our sample, including 5 from the first data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Abazajian et al. 2003, SDSS DR1;), 8 from the archival Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS; Dawson et al. 2013), 1 from the archival 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) (2dFGRS; Colless et al. 2003), and the remaining 10 from the PS1 transients follow-up programs (PI Kirshner and PI Berger) using MMT Hectospec.

The SDSS spectra were observed with a 2.5m telescope and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs at the Apache Point Observatory. Each SDSS spectrum is measured from 3800 Åto 9200 Å on 2048 × 2048 CCDs with a resolving power (λ/∆λ) of ∼ 2000.

Hectospec is a multi-fiber spectrograph mounted on MMT that is capable of observing 300 objects simultaneously (Fabricant et al. 2005). During the observation, a 270 (lpmm) grating was used, which corresponds to a dispersion of 1.21 Å/pix near 5000 Å. The spectral coverage is from 3650 to 9200 Å.

The SDSS spectra were extracted and calibrated with its own spectro2d pipeline while the MMT spectra were reduced with the automated HSRED pipeline, which is an IDL package based on the reduction routines of SDSS spectroscopic data. The optical spectra were reduced following a conventional reduction protocal that includes bias removal, flat fielding, cosmic ray removal, sky subtraction, 1-d spectrum extraction, and wavelength and flux calibration.

The 2dFGRS is a large spectroscopic survey conducted using the Two-Degree Field (2dF) multi-fiber spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian telescope. The survey spectra cover the wavelength range of 3600-8000 Å with a resolution of 9 Å. Due to the lack of flux calibration files for the 2dFGRS spectra, we can only approximate the relative flux by dividing the 2dFGRS spectra by a response curve created from observing a set of stars with SDSS ugriz photometry (Baldry et al. 2002). Pereyra et al. (2006) successfully modeled a composite residual spectrum of over 300 SDSS quasars with a standard disk model in which the mass accretion rate changes from one epoch to another. In this paper, we attempt to take this further by fitting ∆ f SEDs with the P06 model on an object per object basis.


## ACCRETION DISK MODEL

In the standard geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), the potential energy released as the mass accretes onto a black hole is emitted locally. Considering the interplay between mass moving inward and shear stresses transporting angular momentum outward, the disk temperature profile can be described by
T (r) = T * r i r 3 1 − r i r 1/2 1/4 ,(2)
where r i is the inner disk radius and T * is the characteristic temperature defined by
T * = 3GM bhṀaccr 8πr 3 i σ 1/4 ,(3)
where G is the gravitational constant, M bh is the black hole mass, andṀ accr is the mass accretion rate. If we assume the inner disk radius r i to be the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( R ISCO = 6GM bh /c 2 ) around a Schwarzschild black hole, the characteristic temperature T * becomes
T * = Ṁ accr c 6 576πG 2 M 2 bh σ s 1/4 .(4)
Since M bh should not change significantly on a timescale of years, changes in T * trace changes in accretion rate. For a given temperature profile, flux from the disk is given by the sum over blackbody spectra of annuli. The total flux from both sides of the disk is given by
f λ (T * ) = ∞ ri π 2hc 2 λ 5 exp hc λ kT * t(r/ri) − 1 4πr dr,(5)
where c is the speed of light, h is Planck's constant, k is Boltzmann's constant and the function t(
x) = x −3 (1 − x −1/2 ) 1/4 . De- fine s ≡ r r i .(6)
We can rewrite the expression for flux by normalizing the disk radius to the inner disk radius to:
f λ (T * ) = r 2 i ∞ 1 π 2hc 2 λ 5 exp hc λ kT * t(s) − 1 4πs ds.(7)
The observed disk flux can be expressed as
f oλ = c o g λ (T * ),(8)
where c o is a constant that depends on the black hole mass (see definition of R ISCO ), the object's cosmological distance, and the disk viewing angle and g λ (T * ) is defined as the integral in Eq. 7.
g λ (T * ) ≡ ∞ 1 π 2hc 2 λ 5 exp hc λ kT * t(s) − 1 4πs ds.(9)
The P06 model assumes the disk evolved from one steady state to the other between two arbitrary epochs with a change in mass accretion rate ∆Ṁ accr . The observed flux difference is then
∆ f oλ = c o (g λ (T * 2 ) − g λ (T * 1 )),(10)
with a mean characteristic temperature that is defined as
T * = 1 2 (T * 2 + T * 1 ),(11)
and
∆T * = T * 2 − T * 1 .(12)
P06 performed Taylor expansion aboutT * for g λ (T * 1 ) and g λ (T * 2 ) and reduced Eq. 10 to its primary term One thing to note here is that T * 1 and T * 2 cannot be determined individually. Because the partial derivative term here is a function ofT * , one would expect to find pairs of T * 1 and T * 2 that have the sameT * corresponding to several local minima in χ 2 space. To avoid problems caused by this degeneracy, we only fit the mean characteristic temperatureT * in this work.
∆ f oλ ≈ c o ∆T * ∂g λ ∂T * T * .(13

## ANALYSIS

Our analysis consists of three steps: (1) Selecting a sample of objects with a bright and a faint phase that have synchronous interband observations for each object, (2) Constructing the difference-flux SED using the two chosen epochs, and (3) fitting the ∆ f SEDs with the P06 model (Eq. 13). The free parameters in the P06 model areT * and an arbitrary normalization constant.


### Bright and faint phase

Cross matching GALEX NUV and PS1 griz data for studying time variable phenomena can be tricky since the observations were not made at the same time for different telescopes and filters. To preserve the simultaneity of the data, we first group each GALEX epoch with PS1 by minimizing the interband observation gap with respect to GALEX NUV . For each object, the two best aligned GALEX epochs with griz observations within 9 days of the NUV observation are chosen as their bright and faint epochs, where bright and faint are decided by the NUV magnitude.

Next, we take the flux difference between the bright and the faint epochs for each object and propagate the uncertainties to calculate the S/N for the difference-flux (∆ f ). We exclude the small optical variability epochs with a ∆ f S/N lower than 3 in g band. Among the 335 objects that have overlapped in both GALEX and PS1 surveys, we found a sample of 24 objects that have more than one co-temporaneous observations between all 5 bands and have large amplitude of variability (S/N(∆ f g ) > 3) between these two chosen epochs. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the largest observation gaps in each faint and bright epoch for all 24 objects. Most of the epochs used for our analyses have nearly simultaneous observations across NUV and optical bands.


### Construction of the difference-flux SEDs

Once the bright and faint epochs are determined, we reprocess the image subtraction to obtain more accurate flux measurements at the two chosen epochs using a customized pipeline developed by Jones et al. (in prep). Unlike the templates used in photpipe that are created from stacking observations of two earlier epochs resulting in double the typical exposure time of the science epoch, the templates in Jones et al. (in prep) stack images from every season except the season the event was discovered in (∼ 70 images). This pipeline then performs forced photometry on stars in each field to determine the zeropoints of each image after determining accurate stellar centroids using average positions from over 300 individual images. The new pipeline also increased the number of stars used to build the PSF model to improve the fit and reduce the photometric noise.

It is worth noting that the GALEX NUV magnitudes are aperture magnitudes extracted using a 6" radius aperture that include the host flux, while the PS1 g P1 r P1 i P1 z P1 magnitudes are measured after difference imaging, where flux from an earlier template has been subtracted off. We did not perform image differencing on GALEX images since most galaxies are unresolved by the GALEX NUV 5".3 FWHM pointspread function (PSF). When we construct a ∆ f SED, we subtract the flux in each band in the faint epoch from the bright epoch in flux space, so that we are only sensitive to the SED of the change in flux (∆ f ) between the two epochs, and we are insensitive to which template was used to construct the PS1 difference magnitude.

The flux subtraction is performed in flux density units (erg
s −1 cm −2 Å −1 ) to match the model prediction in f λ − λ space.
We demonstrate the construction of ∆ f SEDs in Fig. 3, which shows the light curve of COSMOS_MOS23-10, with vertical dashed lines marking the two GALEX epochs that correspond to the faint and bright phase. The horizontal lines denote the reference magnitude of each filter at the faint epoch.

In Fig. 2, we show in each PS1 griz band the distribution of flux change of any pair of observations with time intervals of 3±0.5d, 9±0.5d, 30±0.5d, and 365±0.5d. The standard deviation of the distribution for each time interval, which measures the amplitude of variability for the given timescale, is indicated by σ 3 , σ 9 , σ 30 , and σ 365 in Fig. 2. From the distribution, we find the variability in g band being more sensitive to timescale than the other 3 filters.

The measurement uncertainty given by our pipeline is comparable to σ 3 in each PS1 band. Although 3 objects in our sample have interband observation gap as large as 7-9 days, we see in Fig. 2 that σ 9 is only ∼36% greater than σ 3 . We find the difference insignificant compared to the uncertainties introduced by subtracting against a bright host galaxy, which can increase the measurement error by a factor of 2.


### Galactic extinction correction

We correct for Galactic extinction before performing model fitting to our difference spectra. For GALEX NUV data, we use the band extinction given in Wyder et al. (2007) that is computed by assuming the Cardelli et al. (1989) extinction law and R V = 3.1.
A(NUV )/E(B − V) = 8.2(14)
On the other hand, the Galactic extinction of each PS1 band are computed as a function of PS1 stellar color with Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction law using R V = 3.1 by Tonry et al. (2012). The Galactic extinction of PS1 bands are given as follows:
A(g P1 )/E(B − V) = 3.613 − 0.0972(g P1 − i P1 ) + 0.0100(g P1 − i P1 ) 2 A(r P1 )/E(B − V) = 2.585 − 0.0315(g P1 − i P1 ) A(i P1 )/E(B − V) = 1.908 − 0.0152(g P1 − i P1 ) A(z P1 )/E(B − V) = 1.499 − 0.0023(g P1 − i P1 )(15)
We use the E(B-V) value from Schlegel et al. (1998) dust map together with Eq. 14 and Eq. 15 to correct for the Galactic extinction in our difference spectra.


### Fitting the difference-flux SEDs

We use Eq. 13 to fit the observed ∆ f SEDs in the rest frame. The partial derivative may be further simplified to (16) Since the shape of the difference spectrum is only affected by the integral, the parameters in this model can be further reduced to one free parameterT * with a normalization factor C = y j y model, j / y 2 model, j , where y j is the observed flux difference in band j and y model, j is the flux difference predicted by the model in band j givenT * . The code integrates Eq. 16 numerically from 6r g out to 300 r g .
∂g λ ∂T * T * = π 2h 2 c 3 λ 6 kT * 2 ∞ 1 t(s) exp hc λ kT * t(s) − 1 2 4πs ds
We adopt both the P06 model and a model-independent power-law f λ ∝ λ −α λ and perform least squares fitting weighted by the measurement error on our ∆ f SEDs. We calculate the goodness-of-fit (χ 2 ν ) that is defined as:
χ 2 ν = 1 N − 2 N j y j − C · y model, j σ j 2 ,(17)
where N − 2 is the number of degrees of freedom of the fit. The 90% confidence interval ofT * is also calculated by varyingT * until ∆χ 2 = 2.706 if the source has more than 4 data points (two degrees of freedom).


### Spectral fitting

We describe in this section the method by which we measure redshift, line widths of Hβ and MgII, and continuum luminosity from single epoch spectra to derive physical quantities such as black hole mass and accretion rate. All of our spectra are corrected for Galactic extinction using the Milky Way extinction curve from Cardelli et al. (1989) with R v = 3.1 and the Schlegel et al. (1998) 
dust map.
For Hβ fitting, we first measure the continuum by fitting a linear function to two ∼ 60 Å wide sampling windows on the left of Hβ and on the right of [OIII] λλ4959,5007 doublet. We remove the continuum and fit three Gaussians to the [OIII] λλ4959,5007 and the narrow component of Hβ simultaneously. The linewidths and the redshift of the three Gaussian profiles are forced to change together but the amplitudes of flux density are allowed to be free. We then use the redshift determined in this step as the systemic redshift to shift the spectrum back to its rest frame and measure the narrow linewidth once again. The broad Hβ emission line is also modelled with a single Gaussian that is allowed to have a velocity offset. We fix the narrow component FWHM and fit both narrow and broad Hβ and [OIII] λλ4959,5007 with four Gaussian profiles simultaneously.

For MgII, we fit a linear function to the continuum on both sides of MgII and subtract the continuum. We modelled MgII with a single Lorentzian profile instead of a Gaussian because the MgII lines in our spectra are better described by the former. We extract the redshift from MgII line fitting if the object does not have catalogued redshift from SDSS. Note that we do not treat the MgII line as MgII λλ 2796, 2803 doublet because the double-peaked MgII features in our spectra are unresolved at our spectral resolution. It is true that by fitting one single line we inevitably account for the narrow MgII λλ 2796, 2803 contamination. Nevertheless, Shen et al. (2011) compared the broad MgII FWHM measurement from treating MgII as a single line and a doublet and found the result to be consistent. An example of the best-fit spectrum is shown in Fig. 4. The redshift distribution of AGN and quasars are shown in Fig. 5. 4.6. Accretion rate The bolometric luminosity (L bol ) of quasars is usually measured by multiplying a bolometric correction to the luminosity density at 3000 Å or 5100 Å. However, this method is subject to the accuracy of flux calibration at a single wavelength. To take advantage of our broad wavelength coverage, we instead apply bolometric correction over a broader wavelength range by assuming the mean quasar SED in Richards et al. (2006).

We first calculate integrated UV/optical luminosity (L UV −opt ) using photometry from GALEX NUV Gezari et al. (2013), CFHT u band, and griz from PS1 (Heinis et al. 2016). Note that since AGNs suffer from host light contamination, we do not try to derive their bolometric luminosity and the accretion rate. Then we scale L UV −opt to L bol using the mean quasar SED in Richards et al. (2006). Richards et al. (2006) constructed for a sample of 259 quasars detected by optical and MIR selection. Photometry data used in the construction of mean quasar SED are SDSS and the four bands of the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera were supplemented by near-IR, GALEX, VLA, and ROSAT data.

We convert the flux density f ν from broadband photometry to luminosity L ν using the following relation   where ν is the observed frequency and D L is luminosity distance. An example of one of our quasar UV/optical SEDs is shown in Fig. 6. The red squares shows the broadband photometry transformed into L ν . The grey solid line is the mean quasar SED from Richards et al. (2006) normalized to enclose the same L ν dν area as the red squares. We then interpolate νL ν linearly between the effective frequency of NUV and z band with a spacing in ∆logν of 0.05 dex and integrate νL ν dlogν in rest frequency to obtain L UV −opt . The fractional contribution of L UV −opt to L bol is calculated using the mean quasar SED in Richards et al. (2006). Finally, we use this fraction to infer L bol from L UV −opt . One thing to bear in mind is that the SEDs of quasars show significant scatter (Richards et al. 2006). Therefore, the value derived should be viewed in an average sense. The accretion rates are then calculated by assuming an accretion efficiency of η ∼0.06 for a non-spinning black hole, where L bol = ηṀ accr c 2 . The result is shown in Table 1.
L (1+z)ν = f ν 1 + z × 4πD 2 L ,(18)

### Virial mass

The reverberation mapping studies in the optical have yielded direct measurements of the sizes of the broad-line region (R BLR ) as a function of continuum luminosity (Bentz et al. 2006, e.g.). With one single-epoch spectrum, the black hole mass can be estimated with a measurement of L cont and the broad-line FWHM, assuming that FWHM reflects the virialized motion of the line-emitting material. In general, the virial mass has the form:
M bh M ⊙ = A λL λ 10 46 erg s −1 B FWHM km s −1 2 ,(19)
where A and B are derived from empirical calibration against AGNs and λ is 5100 Åand 3000 Åfor Hβ and MgII, respectively.

We adopt the calibration of Trakhtenbrot & Netzer (2012). For Hβ, A=105 and B=0.61. For MgII, A=5.6 and B=0.62. During spectral fitting, we measured redshift, FWHM of Hβ and MgII, f 5100 , and f 3000 in the rest frame. We convert the flux density to the luminosity density using Eq. 18.

The object class, the accretion rate, the black hole mass, the Eddington ratio, the FWHM of MgII and Hβ of our sample are listed in Table 1.


## RESULTS

We have compiled a sample of 24 sources that have a variability amplitude greater than 3σ in g band with well-aligned epochs across NUV and optical bands. One of the 24 sources, COSMOS_MOS27-07, shows the spectrum of an early-type galaxy but lacks emission lines typical of AGN so we do not include this source in our model fits (see § 6.2 for discussion of the nature of this source). For the 23 active galaxies, we fit the difference flux SEDs following the method described in § 4.4.

During the model fitting process, we noticed that the bands deviating the most from the P06 model tend to have strong broad emission lines within them. The contribution of broad emission line variability is discussed in § 6.1. We suspect these bands may be contaminated by the emission from the BLR region and could affect our model fitting since the model only accounts for the continuum variability that arises from the emission of the disk. In light of the potential contamination, we repeat model fitting by masking the bands associated with broad emission lines for sources with an original χ 2 ν > 3.0. Five sources show good agreement with the P06 model (χ 2 ν < 3.0) after we mask the broad emission line affected bands while the rest 6 sources still have χ 2 ν > 3.0. The masked bands are shown as red crosses in Fig. 7 and Fig. 11. The summary of the best-fit parameters can be found in Table 2.

We show the ∆ f SED and the best-fit models for each wellfitted (χ 2 ν 3.0) source and sources that exhibit deviation from the model (χ 2 ν > 3.0) in Fig. 7 and Fig. 11. In the upper panel, the vertical axis is the difference-flux in flux density units in logarithmic scale while the horizontal axis is the restframe wavelength in Å. The red line shows the best-fit result from the standard thin disk model while the green line shows the best-fit result of a power-law. The shaded area is bounded by two curves corresponding to the upper (steep) and lower (flat) limit ofT * and is only plotted for objects with χ 2 ν 3.0. We also overplot the spectra for each source in grey in Fig. 7 and Fig. 11 in logarithmic scale. The bottom panel shows the residual divided by the uncertainty (σ) for each band, where  It is worth noting that, for our sample, the P06 model performs significantly better than the power-law in terms of χ 2 ν and the P06 model fits qualitatively well to the data points in Fig. 11 despite their larger χ 2 ν values. For the 17 out of 23 objects that are well described by the model, the distribution of the best-fit mean characteristic temperaturesT * is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 8. The medianT * of our sample is 1.2×10 5 K, which is higher than the mean characteristic temperature of 92000 K found for a composite difference spectrum constructed from SDSS quasars (Pereyra et al. 2006). However, the difference composite spectrum in Pereyra et al. (2006) is not corrected for Galactic extinction, meaning the underlying difference spectrum may be bluer and therefore could imply a hotter disk temperature than the value derived in Pereyra et al. (2006).

The bottom panel of Fig. 8 shows the distribution of best-fit power law indices. A standard accretion disk model predicts a f ν ∝ ν 1/3 spectrum for intermediate ν between the frequencies corresponding to the innermost disk and the Rayleigh-Jeans limit. This value translates to a spectral index α λ of ≈ 2.33. Although the bluer-when-brighter trend can be explained as an intrinsic effect of AGN under the assumption of an accretion disk model, real AGN spectra rarely match this value. Instead, this spectral index is more often seen toward difference spectra of AGN. For instance, Wilhite et al. (2005) found α λ of 1.35 and 2.00 for the average quasar spectrum and the average quasar difference spectrum, respectively, using SDSS spectra without correcting for reddening due to Galactic extinction. Vanden Berk et al. (2001) found a slightly bluer α λ of 1.56 for composite quasar spectrum after correcting for Galactic extinction, but is still not as blue as the theoretical prediction of a thin accretion disk. The composite quasar difference spectrum having a steeper spectral index than the composite quasar spectrum implies that the variable component may come directly from the disk, and that taking the difference flux isolates the radiation from the disk component more cleanly. Our finding of a median of the best-fit power law index α λ ≈ 2.1 is consistent with the spectral index of the SDSS geometric mean composite difference spectrum of quasars in Ruan et al. (2014) and is close to the standard thin disk value of 2.33.

The classic thin-disk model predicts the characteristic temperature T * as a function of accretion rate and black hole mass (see Eq. 4). For example, for a quasar accreting at the rate of 1 M ⊙ /yr with a mass of 10 9 M ⊙ , a standard accretion disk predicts a characteristic temperature of 70,000 K. As a sanity check, we also calculate the characteristic temperature T * using the accretion rates and the black hole masses derived in § 4.6 and § 4.7 using photometry and single-epoch spectroscopy. The distribution of T * andT * are plotted in Fig. 9. The data are binned into 0.1 dex intervals. Note that we only plottedT * for point-like quasars, to avoid estimating the accretion rates for extended sources, which will have systematic uncertainties in L bol due to host light contamination. Although we do not see a one to one correlation in the characteristic temperature T * andT * , the distribution of T * andT * are consistent with each other, and therefore follow the expectations for an accretion disk with the ranges of M bh andṀ accr inferred for the quasars in our sample.  Figure 9. The distribution ofT * (black) and T * (red), whereT * is calculated from fitting the ∆ f SEDs to the P06 model and T * is calculated from substituting accretion rate and black hole mass into Eq. 4. Note that we only include the 12 sources that are classified as quasars to avoid accounting for galaxy light contamination. Although the two histograms seem to have similar temperature distribution, there is no clear trend in the scatter plot ofT * vs T * .


## DISCUSSION


### Emission-line variability

Before masking the bands containing broad emission lines, 11/23 sources in Table 2 have large χ 2 ν values and are clearly ill-fitted by the change in accretion rate model. One likely explanation is that the the ∆ f SEDs of these objects are contaminated by emission line variability. Broad emission lines are known to both vary in flux and in profile (Wamsteker et al. 1990;Kassebaum et al. 1997, e.g.). In extreme cases such as a 'changing-look' AGN that involves the sudden appearance or disappearance of the broad Balmer lines on the timescale of years (e.g. Shappee et al. 2014), the broad band flux may experience a dramatic change due to the change in emission line flux. Using XMMLSS_MOS01-22 as an example, the difference-flux in g band deviates from the model prediction by ∼30% (Fig. 7), which would inevitably result in a poor model fit if we force to fit all bands. In fact, Wilhite et al. (2005) also reported that broad emission lines could vary by 30% as much as the continuum in the spectroscopic variability study of SDSS quasars. It is important to recognize that the amount of flux change contributed by a broad AGN emission line can be non-negligible compared to the change in continuum in broadband.

We find that masking the broad-emission-line contaminated bands can improve the poor model fit. Although only 5/11 originally ill-fitted sources have χ 2 ν < 3.0 after applying band masks, most of the sources have a qualitatively good model fit even when having χ 2 ν > 3.0 (Fig. 11).

6.2. COSMOS_MOS27-07 While examining the spectra, we found one source, COSMOS_MOS27-07, that lacks common AGN emission lines even though classified as an AGN from its morphology and light curve. The light curve of COSMOS_MOS27-07 is shown in Fig. 10.

COSMOS_MOS27-07 resides in an early-type host galaxy with colors u − g = 1.71 and g − r = 1.64. The GALEX TDS catalog reports a maximum variability amplitude (∆m max ) of >1.37 mag, with significant variability on timescales of 1 − 2 years (Gezari et al. 2013). It is unlikely that such amplitude of variability in NUV is caused by core-collapse supernovae since their NUV light curves are powered by expanding shock-heated ejecta, which cool quickly with time.

Such variability can be powered by a tidal disruption event (TDE), which features persistent emission in the UV ( 1 year). However, the long term plateau in the GALEX light curve is unlike the power-law decay observed in TDEs. Observations in X-ray wavelengths may reveal if this object is a X-ray bright, optically normal galaxy (XBONG, Comastri et al. 2002). 6.3. Timescales Due to the time sampling of GALEX TDS, the ∆ f SEDs in our active galaxy sample probe a variability timescale of about a year. An assumption in our model is that enough time has elapsed for the the disk to adjust to a different mass accretion rate. However, the timescale associated with mass inflow, the viscous timescale, is on the order of 1000 years assuming a characteristic disk with thickness h/r = 0.01, M = 10 8 M ⊙ and α = 0.1 at r ∼ 100r g , where r g ≡ 2GM/c 2 is the gravitational radius. In general, the viscous timescale is given by:
τ = h r −2 1 αΩ ,(20)
where h/r is the thickness of the disk in units of the radius, α the viscosity, and Ω the angular velocity. To match the timescale we observed, the mass accretion perturbation must originate from a radius close to the UV/optical emitting region or have a much thicker disk (τ visc ∼ 10 yr if h/r = 0.1).

As pointed out in Pereyra et al. (2006), the observed months-to-years variability timescales are more consistent with the sound-speed timescale of an accretion disk. Changes in accretion rate might result in density and pressure perturbations, which can propagate across a proportion of the disk as sound waves. The DRW model proposed by Kelly et al. (2009) to describe the optical variability seen in quasar light curves, also shows fits with a characteristic timescale of ∼200 days that is consistent with the thermal timescale.

Another possibility is that the UV/optical variability is driven by reprocessing of X-ray photons from the inner disk. Under the assumption of a classic thin disk, the UV and optical spectrum arise predominately from spatially separated locations. Therefore, one would expect the time-lag between different bands to be observed as a result of signal propagation. In fact, inter-band correlations were found in short timescale variability in NGC 2617 and NGC 5548 (Shappee et al. 2014;Fausnaugh et al. 2015) as an evidence supporting the X-ray reprocessing scenario. Following an outburst in NGC 2617, the galaxy has shown disk emission in the UV/optical lagging the X-ray by 2 to 3 days (Shappee et al. 2014). This time lag is consistent with the light crossing time from the inner X-ray emitting region to the outer UV/optical emitting region. Although the UV and optical variability seem to correlate well with the X-rays on short (∼ day) timescales, previous studies also reported the presence of pronounced long timescale (∼ year) variability in the optical but not in the X-rays (Breedt et al. 2009;McHardy et al. 2014), suggesting an independent mechanism contributing to the optical variability.

Unfortunately, with this study, we can not differentiate between the steady-state spectrum of an X-ray-illuminated source from that of a steady-state accretion disk, since they have the same radial dependence (r −3 ). Simultaneous X-ray and UV/optical observations on the light-crossing timescale (∼ days), not available in this study, would be required to distinguish between these two models.


### Inhomogeneous disk model

The main weakness of the P06 model lies in the discrepancy between the observed continuum variability timescales, and the much longer timescales over which an accretion rate can change globally in the disk (see § 6.3 for discussion). Inspired by the better agreement with thermal timescales (Kelly et al. 2009), Dexter & Agol (2011 proposed an inhomogeneous disk model in which the disk is separated into multiple zones that each vary on the thermal timescale, with an independent temperature fluctuation conforming to the DRW process. Furthermore, Dexter & Agol (2011) find that the localized temperature fluctuation model predicts a higher flux at shorter wavelength (λ < 1000 Å) than the standard thin disk model, and can better describe the composite HST quasar spectrum from Zhang et al. (1997). Ruan et al. (2014) fitted a composite relative variability spectrum, created by dividing the composite difference spectrum by the composite quasar spectrum, in the wavelength range of λ = 1500 − 6000 Å. They found that the composite relative variability spectrum is better described by the thermal fluctuation model than the standard thin disk model, assuming a fixed 5% increase in the mass accretion rate for the standard thin disk model. Unfortunately, we cannot directly compare our results by fitting a "relative variability" SED, because of emission line contamination in our broadband photometry. However, the motivation for constructing the relative variability spectrum in Ruan et al. (2014) was to get rid of the effect of internal AGN extinction. However, when we mea-sure the spectral indices of the single-epoch optical spectra of our active galaxy sample, we find only 5 out of 23 targets with a spectral index redder than the spectral index of the SDSS quasar composite α λ ≈ 1.56 (Vanden Berk et al. 2001) that might indicate the presence of internal extinction. In addition, we suspect that comparing the composite relative variability spectrum to the model difference spectra divided by a lowstate disk model, is not a fair comparison, since the low-state disk model, as we discussed in § 5, is much bluer than the observed composite quasar spectrum. In sum, we don't think that internal extinction is a significant issue for our sample, and we find a good agreement between the P06 model and our variability SEDs.

Recent work of Cai et al. (2016) shows the revised thermal fluctuation model with radius-dependent characteristic timescales also shows noticeable departures from the prediction of a standard thin disk model at λ < ∼ 1000 Å. However, since the shortest rest wavelength probed in our sample is ≈ 800 Å, we cannot look for this characteristic signature. Our analysis shows that, on an object by object basis, the P06 model is an appropriate description of the individual ∆ f SEDs of the AGNs and quasars. We do not find the need to invoke the thermal fluctuation model in most of the cases. However, the NUV flux in ELASN1_MOS12-05 and GROTH_MOS03-13 is indeed higher than predicted by the P06 model, introducing localized thermal fluctuations might be able to explain the flux excess in NUV.


## SUMMARY

We analyze the spectral variability of a sample of 24 GALEX TDS NUV variability selected sources with large amplitude optical variability (difference flux S/N> 3 in the g P1 band) in the PS1 Medium Deep Survey. We gathered single-epoch spectra for the sample, and found 23 out of 24 sources have emission lines characteristic of an unobscured AGN. The bluer-when-brighter trend is observed across our sample. We have fitted a standard thin disk model with variable accretion rates as well as a simple power law to the spectral shape of the observed difference-flux SEDs (∆ f SEDs). We have also measured accretion rate, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio for our sample using photometric and spectroscopic data. The mean timescale of UV/optical variability we are probing is one year. We find the change in accretion rate model generally describes the ∆ f SEDs better than a simple power law. Our results can be summarized as follows.

1. The median of the best-fit mean characteristic tempera-tureT * is 1.2×10 5 K. The distribution ofT * is consistent with the distribution of the characteristic temperature T * (median 1.3 × 10 5 K) obtained from independently measured accretion rates and black hole masses.

2. The best fit power-law indices α λ of the difference spectra have a median of 2.1, which is consistent with the value previously found in Wilhite et al. (2005) and Ruan et al. (2014) and is close to the spectral index α λ ≈ 2.33 of a classical thin disk.

Our results suggest that the spectral shape of largeamplitude AGN variability on long timescales (∼ years) is well described by a thin steady-state disk with a variable accretion rate. However, at the wavelength range and timescales we are probing, we cannot distinguish between this simple variable accretion disk model, and a more complicated disk model with localized thermal fluctuation zones, or X-ray reprocessing. Broadband monitoring of AGN on the timescale of days from the soft X-rays to optical would help distinguish between these scenarios.
