NSAIDs includes traditional NSAIDs, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, and NSAIDs given with proton pump inhibitors. Opioids includes strong and weak opioids, and opioid/analgesic fixed-dose combination medications: morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, tapentadol, tramadol, codeine, buprenorphine, dihydrocodeine, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Corticosteroids includes intra-articular and oral. "Other" includes glycosaminoglycans (9.6%), non-opioid and non-NSAID analgesics such as acetaminophen or capsaicin (19.3%) and other medications that were used in less than 5% of patients, including anticonvulsants, biological and traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, antidepressants, bisphosphonates, and muscle relaxants
