(p20.0) The Cone Location and Magnitude Index (CLMI) was first described by Mahmoud and Roberts [37]. The CLMI relies on an area-corrected average steepest 2 mm-diameter circle within the central 8 mm-diameter anterior curvature map. From this, a curvature difference, M1, is calculated as the difference between all points outside the circle and all points inside the circle. A second circle that is centered 180 degrees away in angular position is analyzed in the same manner, resulting in curvature difference M2. CLMI is then calculated based on M1 and M2. In much simpler terms, the CLMI characterizes the steepest area of curvature, and the magnitude of the index identifies the difference between the steepest area and the rest of the curvature map [37]. This is schematically represented in Fig. 6. CLMI was developed as an index that could be calculated on different topographic systems. The index has shown good repeatability among various devices [41,47]. Mauger et al. also calls attention to the value of posterior CLMI, which may serve as a valuable measure of asymmetric corneal steepening [47].
