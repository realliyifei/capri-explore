(p4.0) A total of 31 species, encompassing two suborders, ten superfamilies, 20 families, and 28 genera (Table 1), has been confirmed within Peruvian waters.The suborder Cladobranchia comprises 16 species, spanning five superfamilies and 13 families.The suborder Doridina consists of 15 species, distributed among five superfamilies and seven families (Table 1).Notably, the families Chromodorididae and Discodorididae, both belonging to the suborder Doridina, exhibit remarkable species richness with five and four species, respectively (Fig. 1).Additionally, potentially occurring species (n = 9) are distributed across five superfamilies, eight families, and nine genera (Table 2).A chronological overview of articles documenting nudibranch species in the Peruvian sea can be found in Table 3, revealing the progressive increase in reported species and the latest updates in scientific nomenclature.Regarding the distribution of species along the Peruvian coast, according to the coastal marine biogeographical classification proposed by Spalding et al. (2007), 23 species inhabit within the Warm Temperate Southeastern Pacific province, 18 species are found within the Tropical Eastern Pacific province, and ten species are common to both provinces (Table 4, Fig. 2).Peru's inventory of nudibranch species is comparatively modest in comparison to other South American countries, such as Chile, Colombia, and Brazil (Fig. 3A).Concerning species shared with these countries, of the 31 species that have been conclusively documented in Peruvian waters, 19 species are found  in Chilean waters, four species in Colombian waters, and four species in Brazilian waters (Fig. 3B).The recorded collection/reporting sites of nudibranch species found in Peruvian waters, limited to South America, within the framework of the coastal-marine biogeographical classification proposed by Spalding et al. (2007), are illustrated in Fig. 4.
