(p0.0) 2.1. Covariance, variance and correlation functions. We take the viewpoint of the eigenvalues for a random matrix ensemble as an example of a continuous point or particle process. For notational convenience we regard the points as confined to an interval I of the real line, although this in not necessary -the domain may as well be in higher dimensions. For N particles we let p N (x 1 , . . . , x N ) denote their joint probability density function. Integrating out all but one, respectively two, particles gives the corresponding one and two point correlations ρ (1),N (x 1 ) = N I dx 2 · · · I dx N p N (x 1 , . . . , x N ) ρ (2),N (x 1 , x 2 ) = N(N − 1) I dx 3 · · · I dx N p N (x 1 , . . . , x N ). For large separation we expect ρ (2),N (x 1 , x 2 ) ≈ ρ (1),N (x 1 )ρ (1),N (x 2 ) which motives introducing the truncated (or connected) two point correlation (2.3) ρ T (2),N (x 1 , x 2 ) = ρ (2),N (x 1 , x 2 ) − ρ (1),N (x 1 )ρ (1),N (x 1 ). A simple but fundamental result is that these correlations relate to the covariance between two linear statistics, defined by (2.4) Cov
