(p1.0) This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA principles, which provide a structured approach for synthesizing existing evidence and providing transparent and thorough reports that can assist decision making based on evidence (Page et al., 2021). The Scopus database and Scopus-indexed publishers such as Taylor & Francis, Springer, Science Direct, and Emerald were utilized to obtain publications relevant to our study. In addition, a snowball search step was used to identify further publications that were published between the period 2010 until 2022, this process followed the pattern that was established by Macke & Genari (2019) and Tandon et al. (2020). Furthermore, we included in academic publications studies on comment analysis of social media platforms that were published in English (e.g. books, book chapters, and peer-reviewed articles) and exclude studies that were primarily concerned with developing analytical tools or analyzing the effect of comments on other factors.
