(p8.0) We found 809 records in all predefined databases. After removing duplicates and implementing inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 articles (cross-sectional studies: 3, case reports: 7) were enrolled for the current review ( Figure 1). AI was defined based on laboratory data, computed tomography (CT) results, or a combination of both methods [17,18,24,25]. A summary of included studies based on their designs is provided in Tables 1 and 2. Quality and risk of bias assessment of recruited records are shown in the supplementary material (Tables S1 and S2).

(p10.0) Seven records reported AI occurrence during COVID-19 infection in 7 patients. e ages ranged from 44 to 70 years (males: 4). Evaluation of AI was done through CT findings, laboratory profiles, or both in 2 [24,28], 3 [17,18,31], and 2 [29,30] patients, respectively. Only one patient died [28], and all 6 others were discharged in stable condition with appropriate medical treatment [17,18,24,[29][30][31]]. 2 patients were followed up after hospital discharge with normal status [24,29]. However, two other subjects failed to attend follow-up visits [17,31]. e followup data of two patients were not available [18,30]. International Journal of Endocrinology
