## (s9) Polyphenols
Number of References: 4

(p9.0) Polyphenols are active substances with more than one phenol structural unit per molecule. They represent the largest group of phytochemicals and they are the most abundant antioxidants present in the diet. Total intake of polyphenols can be up to 1 g/day (Scalbert, Johnson, & Saltmarsh, 2005). Moreover, they play a role in preventing several diseases related to oxidative stress, such as cancer, CVDs, and neurodegenerative diseases (Manach, Scalbert, Morand, Rémésy, & Jiménez, 2004). They modulate the activity of a variety of enzymes and cell receptors as a means of defence against oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (Tsao, 2010). Main dietary polyphenol sources include fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, natural fruit juices, tea, coffee, and red wine (Scalbert et al., 2005).
