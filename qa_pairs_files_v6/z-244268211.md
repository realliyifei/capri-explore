(p7.0) Studies revealed that a significant portion of donors felt that donation-related expenditures were burdensome and that LDLT impacted their employment and health insurance. In one illustrative example (33), 40% of donors reported that donation-related costs were burdensome at 3 months post-donation and 19% reported feeling similarly at 2 years post-donation. Cumulatively, 24% of donors found donation-related costs to be more than expected in this study. Furthermore, 34% of donors changed jobs or modified their work because of donation at 3 months post-donation, though only 1% reported changes in employment 2 years later. In this study, those with lower household incomes were at higher risk of poorer financial outcomes. Dew et al. (38) assessed financial burden approximately 6 years after donation and found that 15% of donors reported that donation expenses were burdensome; a portion of these donors changed jobs and experienced permanent income reductions. In this study, 11% of donors also experienced health or life insurance problems due to donation.
