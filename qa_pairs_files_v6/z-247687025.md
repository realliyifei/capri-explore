(p28.0) Through technical advances, ML-based NBS enables new opportunities in reducing false positive rates and identifying so far unknown metabolic patterns by relying on complex feature combinations instead of predefined cutoff values. These mathematical strategies should be regarded as complementary to the combined use of biochemical and genetic tests aiming at improving the diagnostic specificity of NBS programs through second and multiple tier analysis. However, due to the variety of diseases and methods, a general recommendation for a single ML method in NBS is currently not possible. Instead, a thorough analysis of different methods is necessary for all applications. Among the presented, LRA and SVM seem to be valuable candidates for NBS classification since they are often applied, achieve high performance in general and in comparative studies, and handle multidimensional data. Comparing both methods, LRA is interpretable on a modular level, whereas SVM is not and therefore, LRA might be more applicable for NBS. Yet, with the rise of ensemble and deep learning methods, also noninterpretable extensions of these methods such as Ridge-LRA and Bagging-SVM showed promising results. 19,24 In combination with explainable artificial intelligence methods, these noninterpretable methods could be applied more frequently, which will be investigated in comprehensive future studies.
