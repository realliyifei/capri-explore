(p7.0) Mice are capable of being infected by human SARS-CoV (Chen et al., 2010). The virus replicates in lungs and nasal turbinates of BALB/c mice aged 4-6 weeks and is cleared by 7 days post-infection. However, these mice do not develop significant pulmonary lesions when challenged with a human SARS-CoV isolate, limiting their usefulness . Aged BALB/c mice infected with SARS-CoV show evidence of alveolar damage and interstitial pneumonitis similar to human cases (Roberts et al., 2005a). Recently, a novel non-transgenic approach to creating a mouse model for MERS-CoV utilized transduction of BALB/c mice with adenoviral vectors expressing the human host cell receptor for MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Zhao et al., 2014). Infection with MERS-CoV was not fatal, but did produce a perivascular and peribronchiolar lymphoid infiltration, progression to an interstitial pneumonia, and viral clearance occurring 6-8 days post-infection.
