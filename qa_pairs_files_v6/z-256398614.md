(p6.0) During daily activities, the articulating interfaces bear three-dimensional dynamic motion and loading. The frictional forces and moments of the articulating interface are transmitted to the modular interfaces, which leads to the fretting of the modular surfaces. In combination with the presence of body fluids, the modular interfaces undergo fretting wear and fretting corrosion. Figure 7 shows typical fretting corrosion damages of retrieved hip components. Similar phenomena also exist in knee joints [36,37], shoulder joints [38], and spinal fixation using assemblies. It is generally believed that fretting corrosion is widespread in various artificial joints.
