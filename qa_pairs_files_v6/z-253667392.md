## (s17) ACh and Cholinergic System
Number of References: 3

(p17.0) The cholinergic system, including ACh, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), is involved in periodontal disease. Ach, an important neurotransmitter, is mainly expressed by the vagus nerve. Although little evidence shows that the vagus nerve directly affects the periodontium, the components of a functional non-neuronal cholinergic system have been found in oral mucosa [106]. ACh can modulate innate immune responses within the oral mucosa in both an autocrine and a paracrine manner and subsequently participate in the pathological process of periodontal disease [107]. A clinical study showed that the Ach level increases significantly in saliva and GCF with higher levels of IL-17A and IL-17F, which are correlated positively with the severity of periodontal diseases [108], meaning the nonneuronal cholinergic system may influence the etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease.
