(p17.0) Kempe et al. [72] presented the first approximate algorithm based on hill-climbing strategy. Since then most of the existing IM algorithms follow the hill-climbing framework, which is illustrated in Algorithm 1. The algorithm is initialized with an empty seed set . It iteratively selects a node into if provides the maximum marginal gain to the influence function ( ) w.r.t. the partial solution . The algorithm terminates when there are distinct nodes in . The theoretical guarantee of this greedy framework depends on whether ( ) is a non-negative, monotone, submodular function. In particular, [72] proved that (Â·) is indeed so under some classical diffusion models such as IC and LT.
