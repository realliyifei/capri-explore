(p3.0) Leaf samples of Echinodorus macrophyllus purchased from the local market in Belo Horizonte (Brazil) were submitted to γ-radiation at doses of 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 kGy. The overall yield of EO extracted from irradiated leaves (0.67, 0.46, 0.72, 0.58, and 0.418%, respectively) was higher than the corresponding yield for nonirradiated samples (0.27%) [15]. The total content of acyclic monoterpenes and sesquiterpene derivatives in irradiated samples (average values considering all irradiated materials = 0.3 and 3.1%, respectively) was increased in relation to nonirradiated samples (0.11 and 1.90%, respectively). On the other hand, the total content of the other chemical classes, such as triterpenes, diterpenes, esters, and carotenoid derivatives, in irradiated samples (average values considering all irradiated materials = 0.7, 2.7, 76.1, and 3.3%, respectively) was lightly decreased in relation to nonirradiated sample (0.99, 2.93, 79.68, and 4.26%, respectively). Irradiated samples exhibited higher content of linalool, α-caryophyllene, drimenol, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, (E,E)-farnesyl acetone, ethyl hexadecanoate, methyl (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoate, and methyl (E,E,E)-11,14,17-eicosatrienoate (average values considering all irradiated materials = 0.3, 0.7, 1.5, 0.9, 1.4, 1.9, 2.3, and 11.3%, respectively) in relation to nonirradiated sample (0.11, 0.22, 0.66, 0.40, 0.93, 1.22, 1.70, and 7.94%, respectively). On the other hand, the content of dihydroedulan, β-caryophyllene, methyl hexadecanoate, ethyl (Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate, squalene (average values considering all irradiated materials = 0.9, 0.5, 40.0, 6.8, and 0.7%, respectively) exhibited lower relative content when the samples were not exposed to γ-radiation (2.9, 0.8, 44.3, 12.7, and 1.0%, respectively). The samples submitted to γ-radiation did not exhibit significant changes in the content of 10-(acetylmethyl)-(+)-3-carene, (E)-nerolidol, methyl (Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate, (E)-phytol, methyl octadecanoate, ethyl (Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate, and ethyl octadecanoate [15].
