(p3.0) Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease, affecting significantly the patients' ability to function and quality of life. Very often, patients rely on dietary supplements for pain relief. The eggshell membrane has been tested as a natural therapeutic for joint and connective tissue disorders and was reported to exert some beneficial effects on joint pain, stiffness, and cartilage turnover induced by overexercise [69]. In a randomized study, postmenopausal women were assigned to a placebo and intervention group, with thirty women taking orally a commercial product, Natural Eggshell Membrane (NEM Â® ), 500 mg once per day for 2 weeks while conducting regular exercise on alternate days. The results showed that the cartilage turnover was significantly reduced in the intervention group. The consumption of the eggshell membrane product rapidly improved the recovery from exercise-induced joint pain and stiffness as well as reduced the discomfort immediately after exercise [69].
