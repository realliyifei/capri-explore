(p41.0) High-quality Image Deraining Models.As image deraining aims to recover realistic clear images, how to develop an effective model that describes the properties of clear image is important.Below we will present some promising directions for network improvements.(1) Integrating domain knowledge into model development.For instance, by leveraging semantic segmentation, we can identify specific regions of interest in the image such as sky or roads [140].This may allow us to use unequal information from different regions to guide the model in removing rain and avoiding unnecessary information loss.(2) Modeling the distributions of clear images.We can use image generation approaches (e.g., VQGAN [141] or diffusion models [100]) to facilitate the high-quality image restoration.(3) Exploring external information of clear images or distilling the knowledge from large pre-trained models to facilitate the rain removal.By prompt learning or knowledge distillation, the model can benefit from the learned representations and generalization capabilities.This allows the model to effectively utilize the specific prompts or knowledge to better understand and remove rain from images.

(p41.1) Efficient Image Deraining Models.Developing efficient image deraining models is important due to resource-limited devices in most real-world applications.Facing this challenge, we can adopt pruning [142], dimension reduction and feature reuse [143] to remove unnecessary connections or parameters from the network.In addition, knowledge distillation [144] can also be used to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from a complex model to a compact one, effectively compressing the model while maintaining performance.We can also explore neural architecture search [145] to learn compact models by introducing various search strategies to sample architectures from the defined search space.
