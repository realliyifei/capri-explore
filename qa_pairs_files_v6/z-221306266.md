(p0.0) On December 31, 2019, several cases of severe pneumonia were reported from Wuhan, China. The causative agent of the outbreak was identified as Betacoronavirus. Genome sequencing revealed that it is closely related to the SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) which had emerged in 2003, and is designated as SARS-CoV-2 (Gorbalenya et al. 2020;Zhou et al. 2020). In a very short duration, more than 80 000 infectious cases including more than 3000 deaths were reported in China as on March 15, 2020. At the time of this review (18 May, 2020), the disease, termed as COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019), had already become pandemic and spread to more than 216 countries and territories, including community transmissions in countries like the United States, Germany, France, Spain, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Iran, Italy and India. As on July 19, more than 14 007 791 cases and 597 105 deaths had been reported globally, with the rapid growth of numbers in many countries.
