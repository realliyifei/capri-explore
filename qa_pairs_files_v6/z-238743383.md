(p8.0) Football leagues impose serious risks and public health consequences, especially with the presence of a combination of a high-density audience, restricted points of entry, minimum management of people, and lack of onsite emergency medical care. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, football matches could serve as superspreader events that result in serious complications on both national and international levels [25]. In general, health systems are structured to fulfill routine priorities and requirements, and have limited capacity to expand, so MGs often burden the local health care system. Even the most advanced systems and properly planned MG can encounter a disaster that overwhelms local healthcare systems and their capacity to provide an effective emergency response [1]. Effective planning and preparedness for MGs, along with the mitigation of risks related to people's health require special attention to all potential threats, especially in highly frequent MG events such as football leagues. Effective communication, integrated management, and the well-being of all participants can be compromised by ignoring a single risk [8]. Healthcare systems should share, coordinate, and cooperate with all stakeholders and organizations who are involved in MG management [98]. In addition, understanding crowd psychology and behavior at MGs and during emergencies is essential in determining the most effective strategies for communication with crowds during an MG or during major incidents [20]. Provision of services during MGs or in the event of a disaster must be performed through trained personnel and available resources accessible to staff and spectators in a MG event [81]. Given its unique experience, the FIFA has invested in capacity building, developed strategies for risk communication, utilized robust risk assessment tools, and created both rapid and early response systems that enable early detection of potential risks, and thus a proactive response. Several MG assessment tools were developed worldwide; however, to adapt to the Saudi context, the SALEM tool was developed to provide a guide for MG planning and assessment. SALEM assesses the risks of MG events with scores implicating their public health threats and offers the recommended minimum medical resources needed to ensure the safety of the attendees.
