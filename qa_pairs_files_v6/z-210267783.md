(p6.0) Continuous application of inorganic fertilizer without soil test and amendment, in the end increase soil acidity. The use of N fertilizers in form of ammonia is a source of acidification (Fageria and Nascente, 2014; Guo et al., 2010). When ammonium fertilizers are applied to the soil, acidity is produced, but the form of N removed by the crop is similar to that found in fertilizer. Hydrogen is added in the form of ammonia-based fertilizers (NH 4 ), urea-based fertilizers [(CO (NH 2 ) 2 ], and as proteins (amino acid) in organic fertilizers. Transformation of such sources of N fertilizers into nitrate (NO 3 ) releases hydrogen ions (H + ) to create soil acidity. In reality, N fertilizer increases soil acidity by increasing crop yields, thereby increasing the amount of basic elements being removed by crop harvest without incorporation. Hence, application of fertilizers containing NH 4 or even adding large quantities of organic matter to a soil can ultimately increase soil acidity and lower pH (Guo et al., 2010).
