## (s3) Breastfeeding

(p3.0) The establishment of the microbiome in childhood is important for its microbialimmune crosstalk that is thought to be involved in the pathobiology of disease later in life [37]. A longitudinal study demonstrated that after an early developmental and transitional phase in gut microbial composition, a period of microbial stability is reached by as early as 31 months [38]. The most significant factor associated with the early microbial structure is whether or not an individual was breastfed, and it also appears that this is a significant risk factor for the development of IBD. A recent meta-analysis found that breastfeeding (BF) was protective against the development of both forms of IBD, reducing the risk of developing CD (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.85) and UC (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91) [39]. This protective effect was accentuated if the duration of breastfeeding was greater than 12 months.
## (s4) Dietary Fibre

(p4.0) Dietary fibre provides a substrate for the bacteria that inhabit the distal gut, and these bacteria are integral to its handling. Humans produce approximately 17 enzymes to digest fibre. However, these bacteria produce thousands of complementary enzymes to depolymerise and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host absorbable SCFAs. These SCFAs include butyrate, propionate and acetate. Bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum that possess this capability are less abundant in the gut of IBD patients [26]. The IBD-altered microbiota composition results in lower production of anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory metabolites, in particular butyrate, a lack of which may contribute to increased intestinal inflammation [53].

(p5.0) Dietary fibre provides a substrate for the bacteria that inhabit the distal gut, and these bacteria are integral to its handling. Humans produce approximately 17 enzymes to digest fibre. However, these bacteria produce thousands of complementary enzymes to depolymerise and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host absorbable short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These SCFAs include butyrate, propionate and acetate. Bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum that possess this capability are less abundant in the gut of IBD patients [26]. The IBD-altered microbiota composition results in lower production of anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory metabolites, in particular butyrate, a lack of which may contribute to increased intestinal inflammation [53].
## (s9) FODMAPs

(p9.0) Diets low in non-digestible short-chain carbohydrates (collectively known as FODMAPs) have been used with success in improving symptoms in patients with functional gut disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome [61]. A randomised, double-blind placebocontrolled study showed higher symptom scores of pain, bloating and urgency in patients with IBD and concurrent IBS challenged with FODMAPs [62]. An improvement in functional symptoms has been demonstrated in cohorts with IBD and concurrent IBS on low FODMAPs diets [63,64]. In IBD patients adhering to a low FODMAP diet, the abundance of select organisms in the stool was decreased, though overall markers of diversity and inflammation were unchanged. One recent study of 60 IBD patients in remission or with mild disease activity demonstrated an improvement in reported symptom scores as well as faecal calprotectin in the subgroup on a low FODMAPs diet compared with a standard diet, though this finding is yet to be replicated [65].
## (s19) Mediterranean Style Diet

(p19.0) A recent prospective cohort study examined the relationship between consumption of a Mediterranean diet (high in fruit, vegetables, PUFA and protein predominately from fish, legumes and nuts) and the risk of developing CD in a prospective cohort study of 83,147 Swedish adults [52]. They found a dose-effect relationship, with those most adherent to the Mediterranean diet having a lower risk of developing CD. A study examined the dietary intake of 39,511 young women during high school and subsequent development of IBD over 19 year follow up. They found that compared to women who consumed <10 g/day of fish during high school, those with an intake of â‰¥30 g/day had a 57% lower risk of CD [46]. Fish intake did not appear to modulate UC risk.
