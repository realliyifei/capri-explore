(p21.0) Digital twin technology has three main characteristics: i) Full life cycle: the digital twin should run through the entire life cycle of the physical object, and can even go beyond its life cycle and persist in the digital space; ii) Real-time/quasireal-time: the physical object and the twin are not completely independent, and a completely real-time or quasi-real-time mapping relationship should be established; iii) Bidirectional: the data flow between entity object and twin is bidirectional. Based on the idea of digital twin, a series of successful applications in the Internet of intelligence have been demonstrated in areas such as smart cities, manufacturing, and electric power. It has implemented various services, including 3D visualization, intelligent manufacturing, life cycle management, state prediction, and so forth [168]- [170]. In general, through the digital twin technology, the Internet of intelligence can obtain massive data and build a powerful digital twin, thereby simulating the operation rules of entity objects and helping to put them into practice in the real world. Furthermore, the digital twin can also be integrated with other application layer technologies to better serve human beings.
