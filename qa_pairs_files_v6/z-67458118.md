## (s48) Fuzzy Intrusion Recognition Engine (FIRE):
Number of References: 2

(p48.0) This is an anomaly based IDS that uses fuzzy logic. It generates fuzzy sets for every observed feature which are in turn used to define fuzzy rules to detect individual attacks [15]. NETAD: NETAD like PHAD detects anomalies in network packets. PHAD takes into account only the first 48 bytes of each packet whereas NETAD use those 48 byte as one of the attributes. NETAD worked well with DARPA data on 18nattacks which are poorly detected by other IDS [48].
