(p7.0) The nine publications included in this SLR comprised four conference abstracts [53][54][55][56], two peer-reviewed, original research articles [57,58] and three distinct HTA submissions: one submission to the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) published in 2018 [59], one submission (TA588) to the UK NICE published in 2018 [60] and one submission to the US ICER Group published in 2019 [61]. The CADTH [59], NICE [60] and US ICER Group [61] HTA submissions comprised economic models from studies conducted in Canada, the UK and the US, respectively. There was some overlap between the identified published economic evaluations and HTA submissions: the published analysis by Zuluaga-Sanchez et al. 2019 [58] included a similar model to that submitted to NICE [60] and to CADTH [59]. Furthermore, the published analysis by Thokala et al. 2019 [54] included the model submitted to the US ICER Group [61]. All nine publications (including HTA submissions, abstracts and full manuscripts) that met the eligibility requirements of the literature search contained unique data and were therefore considered as discrete publications for the review. selection process that identified nine publications, reporting economic evaluations in SMA that were included in this SLR. a One full publication and one conference abstract were linked studies; both have been retained in the current report as they each report unique relevant data.
