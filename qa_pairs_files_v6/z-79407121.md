(p1.0) Radiation therapy (RT) has been the mainstay in the management of CNS metastases. Since the presentation is often multi-focal, surgery is not indicated [4]. However, responses of tumor metastases to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) (the current standard of care) are usually incomplete and of short duration and often accompanied by local toxicities, such as neurocognitive loss, etc. [4]. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was the treatment of choice in the past [6]. WBRT was usually started with a warm up dose of 50 cGy on the first treatment day increasing gradually to 200 cGy over several daily fractions to a planned total dose of 3000-4000 cGy [6].
