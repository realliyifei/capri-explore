(p3.0) Normal platelet count and morphology. Gs hyperfunction may be associated with discrete macrothrombocytopenia and neurological disorders. Reduced LTA and secretion in response to multiple soluble agonists. Moderate hemorrhagic symptoms; mainly associated with hemostatic challenges. [8,111,112] CalDAG-GEF1 defect (615888) AR RASGRP2

(p3.1) Normal platelet count and morphology. LTA and secretion defects with weak agonists. αIIbβ3 integrin activation defects with weak agonists (fibrinogen binding deficit, PAC-1).
