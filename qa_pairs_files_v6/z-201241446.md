(p0.0) The energy demand of the built environment is almost 50% of the total energy demand of a national economy [1]. In the last decade, the scientific community has become interested in how urban design impacts outdoor thermal comfort. Enhancing the health and well-being of citizens, reducing heat and cold stress, and prolonging periods of comfort, are new focuses on design. For instance, it is today being investigated how the built environment alters local microclimates by influencing a series of thermodynamic phenomena. However, because of the dynamic nature of the urban environment, it is difficult to find a simulation tool that adequately models all of the physical context types. Considering that in the last five years, researchers and designers have increasingly approached the modeling of microclimates, being aware of the modeling capabilities, and limitations of tools applicability has become critical [2].
