(p16.0) Knowledge of partner HIV status is low, and a significant proportion of transmission occurs within stable serodiscordant couples [65]. Couples testing can increase safer sexual behavior and allow timely uptake of and support for ART. Self-testing could provide confidentiality, autonomy, and convenience, and be a potentially suitable model for couples. However the use of self-testing for "serosorting" presents practical and programmatic problems, if the sensitivity of self-testing is suboptimal and because acute infection may not be detected [66]. There are also potential social issues and challenges for clinical follow-up with partner self-testing. Although there are no data regarding coercion, coercive testing by partners is a potential concern, and rigorous monitoring for adverse events is critical if this approach is to be considered.
