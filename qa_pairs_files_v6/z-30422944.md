(p2.0) In their comprehensive review of factors influencing risk of study drug use in North American universities, Arria and Dupont (2010) directly suggest study drug users should meet with mental health professionals [3]. They describe how study drug use can be a significant 'red flag' of underlying mental health issues [3]. The concept that people can continue to use drugs while taking precautions to mitigate risk, but not necessarily decreasing their consumption, relates to harm reduction [45]. Harm reduction is based on the recognition that many people will continue to use drugs through efforts to prevent their use, that the majority of them do not need treatment, and that there are things that can be done to help these groups achieve healthier and more favorable outcomes [45]. It focuses on principles of public health and human rights that are practical, feasible, and effective [45]. There is a need to disseminate harm reduction information to help individuals and policy makers be in a position to make better-informed decisions relating to drug use and to provide more opportunities to lead healthier lives.
