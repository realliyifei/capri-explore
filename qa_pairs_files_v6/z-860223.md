(p3.0) The most important tools we have to mitigate the HIVassociated risk of developing TB infection and disease are (i) access to ART for adults and children with HIV; and (ii) use of IPT. In the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER) trial, conducted in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, TB occurred in 8.3% of children receiving early ART (initiated before12 weeks of age) and in 20% of children receiving delayed ART (commenced only after specific clinical and immunologic criteria were met) [29]. When ART is initiated in older children, reductions in presumed and confirmed incident TB of 32-70% are documented [8]. Nevertheless, HIV-infected children have more TB than their uninfected peers, including in low-burden settings [8,30]. A transient increase in risk can also be expected in the first 3 months of therapy as part of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [31,32].
