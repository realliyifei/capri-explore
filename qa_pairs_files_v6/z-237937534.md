## (s21) Melatonin Interactions with Plant Hormones
Number of References: 3

(p21.0) In line with the definition of plant growth regulator and biostimulant, melatonin may influence and promote plant growth in various ways, also through the modulation of the biosynthesis of hormones, including abscisic acid (ABA), brassinosteroids (BRs), cytokinins (CKs), gibberellins (GAs), jasmonic acid (JA), auxins (AUXs) and strigolactones (SLs). For example, it has been reported that the treatment of plants with melatonin negatively regulates ABA production by down-regulating the key biosynthetic gene, NCED3 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3) and up-regulating the genes related to ABA-catabolism [239,240]. Since ABA is actively involved in the response to water stress, melatonin treatment may help plants to counteract this type of abiotic stress. The drought resistance conferred by melatonin to plants is also due to the up-regulation of the cytokinin gene expression, such as histidine kinases (HKs), histidine phosphotransferases (HPs), and the response regulators (Type-A RRs, Type-B RRs). At the same time, melatonin is able to down-regulate the production of zeatin (ZT), a cytokinin derived from adenine that is mainly produced during biotic stress conditions [34].
