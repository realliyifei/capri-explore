(p2.0) To collect the papers, we searched for deep learn* in the following digital libraries: Scopus, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, SpringerLink and Wiley Online Library. However, we only considered papers published in the software engineering conferences and journals indexed by CSIndexbr [24], which is a Computer Science Index system. 3 CSIndexbr is considered a GOTO ranking [25], i.e., information systems that provide good, transparent, open, and objective data about CS departments and institutions. 4 The software engineering venues listed by CSIndexbr are presented in Table 1. As can be observed, the system indexes 15 conferences and 12 journals in software engineering, including 3 https://csindexbr.org 4 http://gotorankings.org CSIndexbr follows a quantitative criteria, based on metrics such as h5-index, number of papers submitted and accepted to index a conference or journal. By searching for deep learn* we found 141 papers in the conferences and journals listed in Table 1. The search was performed on September 15, 2019. Then, we removed papers with less than 10 pages, due to our decision to focus in full papers only. The only exception are papers published at IEEE Software (magazine). In this case, we defined a threshold of six pages to select the papers. By applying this size threshold, we eliminated 49 papers.
