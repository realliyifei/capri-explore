(p29.0) The earliest hypothesis addressing pathogenesis of Chagas disease stems directly from identification of the parasite in tissues.A precise description of the pathology of acute disease led to the idea that the disease stems from microbial infection.Accordingly, mechanical rupture of parasite nests and degradation of affected tissues could drive chronic inflammation.Nevertheless, the main difficulty in establishing a direct relationship between T. cruzi infection and endemic chronic disease was the absence of parasite nests in pathological sections of tissues from 80% of deceased patients.This difficulty has been resolved with specific immunological tests for indirect identification of parasite antigens and of sensitive genetic markers showing persistence of parasite kDNA in tissues of Chagas patients (Zhang & Tarleton 1999).However, only nDNA detection is indicative of an active T. cruzi infection (Braga et al. 2000, Lauria-Pires et al. 2000) Key questions remained unanswered: (i) why are acute infections usually clinically unperceived before subsiding spontaneously?(ii) Is tissue damage seen in cryptic infections for all patients, or only some patients?(iii) Why do patients showing cryptic chronic chagasic infec-480 480 480 480
