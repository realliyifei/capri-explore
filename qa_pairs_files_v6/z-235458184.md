(p10.0) Self-training figures as another commonly used technique for semi-supervised learning. The idea is to let a classifier learn from its previous mistakes and try to reinforce itself. Self-training acts as a wrapper algorithm that takes any arbitrary classifier. Therefore, if we have an existing, fullysupervised learner that is complicated and hard to modify, self-training is an approach worth considering. Self-training has seen its application in natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation [98] and sentiment analysis [62].
