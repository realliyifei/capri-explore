(p15.0) P. juliflora contains a large number of alkaloids in various parts that were tested for their antibacterial activity using disc diffusion technique on some gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The extract of leaves of P. juliflora showed better activity as compared to other plant parts. Klebsiella was found to more susceptible bacteria then Acinetobacter and Alcaligin [33]. Also, a dose-dependent inhibitory activitiy was observed in concentration range of 50 mg/ml to 300 mg/ml and results demonstrated that the extract showed good inhibitory activity against all the bacterial strains like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumonia, M. luteus, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhimurium [52]. Similarly, well-diffusion test was carried out for P. juliflora methanolic extract on Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp. and Streptococcus sp.) and Gramnegative bacteria (E. coli and Klebsiella sp.) by Raghavendra et al. to study the inhibitory action of the extract on various bacteria. Widest zone of inhibition was showed by green leaves (22 and 19 mm zone of inhibition) as compared to dry leaves (22 and 19 mm zone of inhibition). The study findings concluded that gram-positive bacteria are more affected than gram-negative bacteria. Also, methanol extract of green leaves of P. juliflora was more effective as compared to dry leaves [24].
