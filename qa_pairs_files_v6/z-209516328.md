## (s23) Bug 11: Race Conditions of Events
Number of References: 2

(p23.0) A. Attack Scenario. As is defined in [5], an attribute of a device can not be modified to conflicting values by two or more noncomplementary event handlers of multiple apps working in concert, which may lead to a potential race condition. For example, "When motion is detected, turn on the switch" and "Every day at midnight, turn off the switch" will conflict if motion is detected at 12 pm. It is notable that the authors [5] do not investigate what attacks the adversary may realize by utilizing these bugs. Thus, the consequences caused by this bug are limited to leading devices trapped into insecure or unsafe states. * All the unexpected trigger-action bugs covered in this section lie in Samsung's Smart-Things Platform B. Cause Analysis. Upon its subscribed events' occurrence which is different from each other, two or more independent event-handlers of multiple apps are invoked to take actions possibly at the same time to manipulate the same attribute of one device to conflicting values. The sequence and timing of actions of these event-handlers usually make the final states of devices unpredictable.
