(p29.0) Classical and more advanced (neural networks-based) regression methodologies are greatly appreciated in derivative pricing problems, in particular for options with early exercise, like American options (see Sect. 2.1.1), when they are priced by Monte Carlo methods. The plain regression algorithms rely on solving linear systems, a task of enormous interest in quantum computation. The HHL algorithm proposed in [43] is a first relevant representative algorithm for solving linear systems, allowing to diagonalize some special matrices with exponential speedup. Then, the HHL algorithm was employed to perform a regression on a quantum computer in [90]. Some related works in this field are [78,89]. A more involved approach is presented in [74], where the authors tested several existing quantum (machine learning) regression algorithms tailored to a specific problem in chemistry, like Quantum radial basis function neural network [79] or Quantum Neural Networks [10] (and the references therein). Other quantum-based techniques like Quantum Kernel Estimation [28] and QML with Gaussian processes [94] have been recently proposed.
