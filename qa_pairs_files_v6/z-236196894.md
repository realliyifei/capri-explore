(p2.0) After maturation, the embedded bacteria are placed in an organized structure inside the biofilm. Even though biofilm thickness ranges in-depth and despite the formed network for nutrients supply, these are not adequate for all the embedded bacteria [32]. This gradient of decreasing concentration in nutrients and oxygen promotes four distinct metabolic states inside a biofilm, ranging from cells under aerobic metabolism located near the surface to dormant and dead cells deeper in the biofilm. Rani et al. confirmed this observation after studying S. aureus biofilms, in which they described that cells closer to the surface created an anaerobic zone [33]. In contrast, two-thirds (2/3rd) of the biofilm were metabolically inactive. The bacteria located in the superficial active zone can detach from lack of nutrients and transport to adjacent areas creating new biofilms [34].
