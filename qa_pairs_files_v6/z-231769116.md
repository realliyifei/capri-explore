(p0.0) Recently, biopolymers have attained enormous attention with perspective multifunctional and high-performance biocomposites having a low environmental impact with unique properties like, abundantly available, renewable, eco-friendly, and lightweight. Biopolymeric composites should substitute synthetic materials in optics, biochemistry, and biomedical engineering with versatile applications, and investment and research on these materials increase significantly. Biopolymers and biodegradable synthetic polymers have attracted researchers' enormous attention in recent years [1,2]. Such materials have shown a significant role in synthesizing various biomaterials to serve diverse applications in medical science. The 'green', sustainable, biodegradable, and 'eco-friendly' polymeric composite materials with renewable and recyclable potential are desired in biomedical applications. Environmental protection is a motivating impulse behind such production of polymeric composites [3]. As recycling approaches are very expensive, the environmental factors related to continuous plastic-based pollution are causing serious global concerns.
