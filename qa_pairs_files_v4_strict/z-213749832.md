## (s7) Design for empowered users
(p7.0) Through open innovation, customers can be empowered to become involved in the front end of the design process using digital design and product development tools and become active members of the product design team, which exceed mass customisation and the possibility of choosing from possible pre-defined alternatives (Würtz et al. 2015). In Würtz et al. (2015), for instance, the customer generates the geometrical dimensions of the product himself/ herself, which are produced by a assembling a combination of additive manufactured parts and pre-manufactured parts. For example, 247TailorSteel is a company that manufactures customised stainless-steel blanks for several industrial equipment manufacturers in the Netherlands. In this case, an industrial IoT drives a network of manufacturing technologies-or CPSs-that automatically translate customer orders from the upstream online product configurator, through manufacturing planning and control and down to the delivery to the customer (www.247ta ilors teel.com).
