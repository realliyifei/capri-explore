## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are two technologies that have developed rapidly in recent years in the fields of computer graphics and human-computer interaction [1]. Both provide different experiences when using technology to convey information or create interactions with the digital world. VR refers to technologies that allow users to experience and interact with fully-created digital environments, often isolating them from the real world. VR provides the ability to train individuals to deal with complex and dangerous situations by immersing them in a virtual environment and enabling them to learn about the process of acquiring knowledge and skills. In a VR experience, the user wears a special headset that provides visual, audio, and sometimes tactile or body movement sensations. The main goal of VR is to provide a highly immersive experience that makes you feel like you are actually in a digital environment [2].

(p0.1) Meanwhile, AR is a technology that combines digital elements with the real world [3]. In an AR experience, users can see the real world around them through the camera on a smartphone or tablet or through special AR glasses. Digital elements, such as 3D objects, additional information, or animations, are added to the real environment via the device screen. The main goal of AR is to enhance real-world experiences with relevant digital information [3].
