## (s1) PIK3CA mutations in ER1 BC
(p1.0) The most common PI3K pathway alteration in ERþ BC is PIK3CA oncogenic mutations, while PIK3CA gene amplification in the absence of mutation is relatively rare [3]. PIK3CA mutations are present in up to 40% of ERþ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative primary and metastatic tumors and result in constitutive enzymatic activity [4][5][6]. Many retrospective studies, including a large meta-analysis of >10 000 patients with early-stage BC [7], have proposed that PIK3CA mutations are prognostic markers for improved relapse-free survival on univariate analysis [8,9]. However, these studies have also confirmed that, when controlling for additional favorable-risk clinical variables such as ER positivity and receipt of hormonal therapy alone without chemotherapy, PIK3CA mutations are not prognostic for improved relapse-free survival or overall survival [7,8]. A study in HER2-positive (HER2þ) BC has found that PIK3CA mutations predict for decreased overall survival [7], suggesting additivity between upstream RTK signaling and PIK3CA mutation, and this has provided the preclinical rationale for investigating combination anti-HER2 therapy with PI3K pathway inhibition [10].
## (s2) Other PI3K pathway alterations in ER1 BC
(p2.0) Upstream RTKs overexpression or mutations can hyperactivate their downstream signaling pathways including PI3K. ERBB2 amplification/HER2 overexpression is found in 10% of ERþ BCs [16], and rare HER2 mutations associated with endocrine resistance have also been characterized [17,18]. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification is found in up to 12% of ERþ BCs [19]. There are multiple direct and indirect mechanisms of interactions between upstream RTKs and the PI3K pathway, rationalizing combination therapies of PI3K inhibitors with RTK inhibitors. Mutations in Ras, which is also upstream of PI3K, are infrequent in BC (<1%, TCGA), though loss of negative regulators of Ras have been reported in luminal B tumors [20].  Figure 1. Signaling by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is activated by various growth factor receptors such as HER2, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), insulin-like growth factor 1 R (IGF1R) among others. PI3K proteins are recruited to the plasma membrane, leading to phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits to the membrane the AKT kinases that, once activated by PDK1 and mTORC2 phosphorylation, are able to phosphorylate TSC2 and negatively regulate the activity of the kinase mTOR. mTORC1 also phosphorylates and activates S6K. Also shown are few examples of PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors in clinical trials.
