## (s18) Hybrid Polygon Mesh Generation
(p18.0) In practical applications, due to various nonideal conditions, it is often impossible to generate only a single basic facet. Therefore, some researchers have designed hybrid mesh generation algorithms out of active or passive intention. However, due to the limitation of their application, there are only a few types of IMG with hybrid meshes as the generation target. In the literature that we searched, only BP-ANN [114], AnalyticMesh [101] and PolyGen [70] belong to this category. BP-ANN generates anisotropic quadrilateral and isotropic triangular meshes by the advancing front method, which improves the level of automation and efficiency of hybrid mesh generation. AnalyticMesh marches among analytic cells to recover the exact mesh of the closed, piecewise planar surface captured by an implicit surface network. The algorithm is applicable to more advanced MLP architectures, including those with shortcut connections and max pooling operations, which support a richer set of architectural designs for learning and exactly meshing complex surface shapes. Polygen more compactly represents the surface of the object with different polygons.

LLM judge: NO

The content does not meet the criteria for several reasons:
1. The text is not self-contained, failing to offer comprehensive context or clarity without access to the full paper. Without further detail on how these algorithms operate or what specifically makes them suitable for hybrid mesh generation, the reader is left with questions.
2. The text contains references to specific algorithms and studies ([114], [101], [70]) without explaining their significance or findings, relying on external sources for a full understanding.
3. The content mentions “nonideal conditions,” “hybrid mesh generation algorithms,” and various specific programs (BP-ANN, AnalyticMesh, PolyGen) without adequately explaining these terms or concepts, making it inaccessible to those not already familiar with the topic.
4. The text assumes prior knowledge about mesh generation, its challenges, and the importance of the algorithms mentioned, which violates the requirement for the content to be comprehensive and understandable on its own.
