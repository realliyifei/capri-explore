## (s7) Glycans and Glycopeptides Characterization by MALDI-MS or LC-MS/MS
(p7.0) The analysis of glycans or glycopeptides has always been very challenging due to the limited quantities that are released from glycoproteins. Since the structure of a glycan may depend on the expression, activity, and accessibility of the different biosynthetic enzymes, it is not possible to use recombinant DNA technology in order to produce large quantities of glycans for structural and functional studies as it is for proteins. Mass spectrometry could be a valuable tool for their characterization thanks to high sensitivity and selectivity. MALDI-MS is an effective technique for N-glycan analysis of simple or complex matrices such as recently reported [105,106]. Amoresano et al. published a glycoproteomic characterization of human sera from healthy donors and patients affected by myocarditis for the identification of glycoproteins (even the least abundant), including the location of N-glycosylation sites and the profile of glycans present [107]. The strategy was simply based on the proteolytic digestion of serum proteins followed by a single enrichment step of glycopeptides by affinity chromatography using ConA lectin. The glycopeptides were then deglycosylated by treatment with PNGase-F and the free peptides analyzed by nano-LC/MSMS, which allowed both the identification of the individual proteins and the elucidation of their modification sites. Profiles of oligosaccharides released by MALDI-TOF (time of flight) were also obtained.
