## (s6) Research considerations
(p6.0) Despite the increasing awareness and efforts, there remains significant sex and gender disparities in clinical studies leading to an incomplete understanding of disease [218]. In clinical trials, although we may see sex-stratified results, the efforts to consider gender and sex as it may relate to efficacy and safety of therapeutics remains limited. Inclusion of a gender dimension to these clinical studies will contribute to greater understanding of disease manifestations and outcomes in males and females [219]. Sex and gender aspects and their inter-relations need to be considered in all aspects of the research process. When sexand/or gender-specific differences are identified in pilot studies, clinical trials (therapies, devices etc.) should be sufficiently powered to evaluate these endpoints, be it related to safety or efficacy. Conscientious recruitment strategies at an early study or trial stage and in line with the study design can help to have equitable enrolment by sex and gender as well as assist with downstream late-phase trials. Given our movement towards personalised and precision-based medicine, sex and gender equity in studies will go a long way towards reaching this goal. Alongside investigators, similar efforts must be put in by academic institutions, pharmaceutical and bio-engineering companies, publishers, as well as policy makers such that we can innovate our current research paradigm and advance together.
