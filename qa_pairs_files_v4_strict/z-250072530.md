## (s10) Capturing the heterogeneous TTDs based on different modeling rationales
(p10.0) As verified by Pl√∂tz et al. (2017) and Zang et al. (2018a), the performance of the same TTD model in fitting different travel time datasets may be different. Consequently, many different TTD models, based on different modeling rationales, have been developed to fit heterogeneous TTDs. As can be seen from Table 1, the TTD models based on single distribution and mixture modeling rationales have been widely studied for decades. In particular, the single distribution model is suitable for fitting a TTD with a typical right-skewed distribution and a long/fat tail,
