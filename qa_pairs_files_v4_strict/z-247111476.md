## (s8) Food Insecurity and Outcomes
(p8.0) The authors of the reviewed literature identified many relationships between FI and specific outcomes among college students. To begin, the outcome most notably unique among this group compared to the general population is academic performance. Higher rates of FI among college students were consistently associated with lower grade point average. There is evidence that dietary behaviors (e.g., eating breakfast) and quality (e.g., increased fruit and vegetable consumption) are related to better academic outcomes [57]. In this review, FI was related to dietary behaviors and quality such as increased frequency of skipping meals; lower fruit, vegetable, and fiber intake; and increased intake of  added sugars, processed foods, fast food, dairy, and calcium. Conversely lower FI was associated with higher rates of nutrition literacy, which has been shown to predict adherence to healthier dietary patterns [58]. In regard to FI and other health outcomes, college students experiencing FI were more likely to report poor overall health than students not experiencing FI. These health metrics included less frequent medical visits/exams, poor mental health, increased psychological stress, increased depression, poor sleep quality, disordered eating/eating disorders, increased obesity, less physical activity, increased tobacco and marijuana use, and higher rates of binge drinking. College students experiencing FI employed various coping strategies to meet their food needs such as more frequent attendance at events that offered free snacks and meals, increased use of food pantries, greater frequency of skipping meals, decreasing portion sizes, stretching the available food over a longer period of time, and purchasing low-cost, highly processed foods.
