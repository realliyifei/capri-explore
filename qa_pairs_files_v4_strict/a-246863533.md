## (s6) Open Problem 7. Does an EFR allocation always exist?
(p6.0) PMMS and GMMS: Several variations of MMS have also been considered. Caragiannis et al. [2019b] defined the notion of pairwise maximin share fairness (PMMS) according to which, for every pair of agents i and j, i's value for A i must be at least as much as the maximum she could obtain by redistributing the set of goods in A i âˆª A j into two bundles and picking the worst of them. In other words, instead of requiring the maximin share guarantee to be achieved for the set of all agents, PMMS requires that it is achieved for any pair of agents. Despite the apparent similarities in the definitions of PMMS and MMS, Caragiannis et al. [2019b] showed that their exact versions are actually incomparable. e main open problem here is the following.

LLM judge: NO

The content lacks coherence and logical connection without further context or explanation, failing criteria 5 and 6. It references specific terms and studies (e.g., PMMS, GMMS, MMS) without providing their full definitions or explaining their significance, implying that it cannot stand alone for clarity and understanding. Additionally, the text hints at a comparison and an open problem without elaborating on these, making it incomplete for someone without access to the full paper or background knowledge on the topic.

## (s12) Group Fairness
(p12.0) In the model we discussed in the main part of the survey, each agent is assumed to be unrelated to other agents. However, there are applications where it makes more sense for agents to be grouped together (e.g., each group might correspond to a family). Several models capturing scenarios along these lines have been considered in the literature. Suksompong [2018] focused on a se ing where each agent derives full value from all the goods allocated to the group she belongs to, and showed bounds on the best possible approximation of MMS. Kyropoulou et al. [2020] considered EF1 and EFX allocations in the same se ing, as well as in se ings with dynamic group formation; some of these results were later improved by Manurangsi and Suksompong [2021] using ideas from discrepancy theory. Segal-Halevi and Suksompong [2019] focused on the case of democratic fairness, where the goal is to compute allocations that are considered fair (e.g., satisfying EF1) by a high fraction of the agents in each group. A different model was studied by Conitzer et al. [2019], where goods given to a group are then distributed among its members, and thus the agents derive value only from the goods allocated personally to them.

LLM judge: NO

The analysis shows that the content does not meet several of the criteria for suitability:

1. The content is primarily a collection of references and mentions of various models without detailed explanation or context. This makes it difficult for the content to be self-contained as required by criteria 5.

2. The text does not provide comprehensive context or a cohesive narrative, failing criteria 2 and 6. It mentions several different models and findings without clearly explaining the relationship between them or providing a unifying theme.

3. There are unclear symbols or errors from PDF extraction evident in words like "se ing" which should presumably be "setting". This violates criterion number 4.

4. While it does not heavily depend on mathematical equations or non-textual elements (criteria 3), the lack of clarity and cohesion impacts its suitability for a question-answering dataset.

Moreover, because it jumps quickly between studies and findings without much explanation, it's challenging to create a single question that summarizes the content cogently.

## (s14) Randomness in Fair Division
(p14.0) Until very recently there were barely any works on randomized algorithms for discrete fair division. is is partially due to the strong general preference for deterministic algorithms / mechanisms within the Computational Social Choice community (which is well-justified in many se ings, yet such a discussion is beyond the scope of this survey), but also due to the nature of the problem itself. On one hand, randomness cannot help with achieving ex-post fairness, i.e., fairness in each resulting allocation, for any of the deterministic notions mentioned herein. On the other hand, achieving ex-ante envy-freeness, i.e., envy freeness with respect to the expected utilities, is trivial; just allocate all the goods to a single agent uniformly at random. Freeman et al. [2020] proposed an algorithm that achieves ex-ante envy-freeness but is also ex-post EF1, i.e., all the possible allocations it outputs are deterministically EF1. Aziz [2020] gave a simpler algorithm with the same fairness guarantees that also satisfies a weak efficiency property. Finally, in a somewhat different direction,  studied interim envy-freeness, a notion which lies between ex-ante and ex-post envy-freeness.

LLM judge: NO

The content does not meet the criteria for the following reasons:
1. The text lacks comprehensive context or explanations of the key concepts it introduces, such as "ex-post fairness," "ex-ante envy-freeness," or "EF1." This makes the paragraph difficult to understand without prior knowledge, failing criterion 5.
2. The paragraph mentions specific algorithms and studies by Freeman et al. [2020] and Aziz [2020] without providing enough detail about these works or explaining how they relate to the broader discussion. This creates a reliance on external sources, again violating criterion 5.
3. The content hints at a broader discussion on the preference for deterministic algorithms in Computational Social Choice, suggesting that the extracted text is part of a larger argument or section that is not self-contained within this snippet.
4. The logical flow from deterministic to randomized algorithms and the discussion on fairness concepts may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject, due partly to the abrupt introduction of terms and lack of explanatory context. 

Additionally, the mention of specific studies without detailed explanation could be seen as suggesting a list-like format that doesn't fully elaborate on the content, indirectly affecting criterion 2.
