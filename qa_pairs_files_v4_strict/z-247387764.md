(p10.0) In the study by Tang et al. (2019), the effect of monocytes/ macrophages on the osteogenic differentiation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in three dimensional (3D) cocultures was evaluated [42]. The authors showed that monocytes and macrophage subtypes inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs in 3D PLGA/PCL structures. More specifically, the cocultured monocytes/macrophages decreased the expression of osteogenic markers such as ALP, BSP, and RUNX2. These results highlight the overlooked fact that inflammation can regulate osteoblasts from MSC-based bone constructs within the bone microenvironment. In this sense, the tight control of inflammation may be necessary to create an anabolic environment and improve cell-based bone construct performance.
