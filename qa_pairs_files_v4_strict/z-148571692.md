## (s4) PLP-DEPENDENT PROTEINS AND ENZYMES INVOLVED IN VITAMIN B6 METABOLISM IN BACILLUS SUBTILIS
(p4.0) To identify the B. subtilis proteins and enzymes that require PLP for activity and are involved in vitamin B6 metabolism, we compared the Enzyme Commission (E.C.) numbers of the proteins from the B. subtilis 168 laboratory strain found in the SubtiWiki database (http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/v3/) (Zhu and Stülke, 2017) with the E.C. numbers that are deposited in the B6 database (Table 1) (http://bioinformatics.unipr.it/cgi-bin/ bioinformatics/B6db/home.pl) (Percudani and Peracchi, 2009). We also describe proteins from the SubtiWiki database that are specific for B. subtilis and are therefore not present in the B6 database. Publications describing proteins involved in vitamin B6 metabolism in B. subtilis were also added to the Table. A recent mass spectrometry approach in combination with modified pyridoxal analogs identified proteins in the Grampositive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus that probably depend on the B6 vitamer PLP (Hoegl et al., 2018). The study confirmed the binding of PLP to proteins of known and unknown function and identified 4 additional PLP-binding proteins (HemH, HemQ, YtoP, and YwlG) (see below). In total we ended up with 65 PLP-dependent proteins in B. subtilis, of which 61 proteins are bona fide PLP-dependent proteins. The PLP-dependency of four proteins remains to be experimentally validated. Table 1 also contains the PDB identifiers of structures that are available in the PDB database for the B. subtilis proteins. In case the structural information was not available, we have added the PDB identifiers from PLP-dependent homologs showing more than 27% overall sequence identity. We have also included information about the physiological functions of the proteins and their paralogs, the transcription factors that are involved in synthesis of the proteins and information about the sequence similarities with other proteins from the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot. org). The list of proteins involved in vitamin B6 metabolism in B. subtilis will certainly be extended in the future because PLPdependent enzymes are ubiquitous and evolutionary diverse, making their classification based on sequence homology difficult.
