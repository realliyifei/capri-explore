## (s3) PMF analysis of aerosol mass spectra
(p3.0) Lanz et al. [51] reported the first PMF study on an AMS dataset acquired in Zurich, Switzerland, in summer 2005 and identified six factors, including an HOA, two OOAs, and three factors linked to charbroiling, wood burning, and food cooking sources, respectively. The less oxidized OOA-2 factor was found to represent less processed, more volatile SOA [51]. Ulbrich et al. [38] also reported using PMF for identification of a semivolatile OOA-2 factor, in addition to a more oxidized, regional OOA-1 and an HOA in Pittsburgh. These PMF results agree well with the original two-factor (HOA and OOA) CPCA results of Zhang et al. [40,55]. The fact that PMF is able to retrieve a low-concentration, yet distinct factor (OOA-2) highlights its strength in extracting information from datasets, e.g., resolving factors that make up a small fraction of the total mass. Based on PMF analysis of synthetic ORG matrices that were reconstructed assuming variable contributions from Pittsburgh OOA-1, OOA-2, and HOA factors, Ulbrich et al. [38] estimated that PMF of quadrupole AMS data (unit-mass resolution; UMR) can typically retrieve factors that account for at least 5% of the AMS mass.
## (s4) % of Total Signal
(p4.0) The elemental and organic mass-to-carbon ratios for each factor are shown in the legends. (Adapted from Ref. [39]) A summary of the key diagnostic plots of the PMF results is shown in Fig. 5 AMS and the other from an on-line GC-MS. Because both techniques determine individual molecules (or larger fragments or decomposition products) in aerosols, these analyses may be particularly useful for studying the sources and source contributions of OA. Williams et al. [69] performed PMF analysis on hourly timeresolution data of organic marker compounds measured with a thermal desorption aerosol GC-MS-FID (TAG) instrument from a study site in Riverside, California. The grouping of marker compounds in each factor was used to identify the presence of several different source types, including local vehicle emissions, food cooking operations, biomass burning, regional primary anthropogenic emissions, biogenic POA sources, several types of SOA, and semivolatile anthropogenic and biogenic OA. A key challenge in this type of tracer-based apportionment is to assign a fraction of OA mass to each factor, because the tracers account for only a small fraction (<20%) of the OA mass. Williams et al. [69] performed this step using a multivariate fit of their OA components to the AMS OA concentration. Figure 3 shows the diurnal cycles of OA sources obtained with this method during the summer study, with SOA (POA) being more important during the day (evening/night), in agreement with, e.g., the NYC results in Fig. 2 and AMS results at other locations. An earlier study applied principal-component analysis (PCA) on data from the same instrument, and identified several sources due to transported and local anthropogenic pollution, transported and local biogenic emissions, and a local marine or dairy source, for a summer 2004 dataset in coastal Nova Scotia, Canada [70]. However, PCA apportions variance, and the resulting time series and mass spectra of the factors can contain negative values. PCA is therefore fundamentally different from PMF, which apportions the mass directly into nonnegative solutions that are physically meaningful.
## (s5) Evaluation and selection of PMF solutions
(p5.0) Although a major objective of multivariate factor analysis is to explore underlying covariation of variables in a dataset to extract physically meaningful factors that can be related to distinct sources, processes, and/or properties, the solution algorithms provide only mathematical solutions that require careful evaluation and interpretation. In this section the various steps in PMF analysis are illustrated within the framework of AMS data. Ulbrich et al. [38] conducted a thorough assessment of PMF modeling of AMS data and discussed in detail several technical aspects of the analysis, including error matrix preparation, data pretreatment, selections of the optimum number of factors (P) and rotational forcing parameter (FPEAK), and evaluation of PMF solutions. These steps are summarized in Table 1. These authors also reported the development of an Igorbased (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA) open- source PMF Evaluation Tool (PET, available at http:// cires.colorado.edu/jimenez-group/wiki/index.php/PMF-AMS_Analysis_Guide#PMF_Evaluation_Tool_Software) that enables systematic probing of the PMF solution space, automated batch analyses, and user-friendly visualization and intercomparison of the solutions and residuals [38]. Figure 5 shows a summary of key diagnostic plots useful for evaluating the final PMF results from an AMS dataset, which should also be useful for other aerosol mass spectrometers. An important first step of the PMF analysis is to decide the optimum number of factors that "best" explain the data. Ulbrich et al. [38] demonstrated that the trend of the PMF quality-of-fit parameter (Q) changing with regard to the number of factors can be useful to identify the minimum number of factors (Fig. 5a). A large decrease in Q/Q exp with the addition of a factor indicates that the additional factor is able to explain a significant fraction of the variation in the data unaccounted for by the others. In addition, examining the Q/Q exp contributions per column (m/z) or per row (t) in the matrix may help identify individual m/z values or time steps that affect the model lack-of-fit most strongly (Fig. 5h, i). Depending on the causes, and especially when non-physical effects (e.g., instrumental issues) cause extraneous variability that interferes with the PMF identification of the real components, the corresponding variables may be properly downweighted or even removed to reduce disproportionate effects on the fitting outcome [74].
