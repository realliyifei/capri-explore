## (s5) Camera Coverage
(p5.0) In the application of target tracking, FRs are usually equipped with cameras facing the ground [13,22,23]. In general, the cameras have a fixed angle of vision Î¸, see Figure 2. Then, when a FR is at altitude h, the corresponding coverage area is a circular area with the radius:

(p5.1) If a target is within the range of r max to the projection of a FR, this target is covered by the FR [7,22,24,25]. It is clear that the coverage radius relates to the altitude of the FR, and increasing the altitude enlarges the coverage area. An implied assumption is that the target has the Line-of-Sight (LoS) with the FR. If there is any obstacle between the two parts, the former cannot be observed by the latter, although the above condition holds.
