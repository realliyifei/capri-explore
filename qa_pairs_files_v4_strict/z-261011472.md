## (s18) 3) HIGH-GAIN ANTENNAS AND MIMO
(p18.0) Dipole antennas and patch antennas were employed in almost 70% of the deployed CubeSats. The design of more efficient and high-gain antennas is a critical method for improving CubeSat communications. For example, [112] described the design and successful implementation of a high gain S-band slot antenna that significantly increased the gain from 2.52 dBi to 8.8 dBi. Improvements on the antenna design are not just limited to increasing the gain but can extend to decreasing the antenna size, increasing its power efficiency, and use of beam steering techniques if required [112]. Moreover, the use of multiple antennas, which is still not common in CubeSats, to exploit the features of MIMO and beamforming techniques is an important development to increase the data rate and serviceability, especially if we consider mobile ground stations. Such development faces many challenges including power, size, complexity, and need for more powerful energy-efficient processors to execute the various MIMO/beamforming algorithms. Consequently, employing beamforming requires considerable improvements on both the RF and baseband sides.
