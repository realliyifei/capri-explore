## (s4) Lopinavir/ritonavir:
(p4.0) During this COVID-19 outbreak a combination of Protease inhibitors i.e. Lopinavir/Ritonavir was frequently proposed and prescribed. It is the same drug which is used in the treatment of HIV-AIDS. It is readily available at a economic price point as it one of the HIV medication under the WHO essential list of medicines (7). The off-label use of this combination was considered because it inhibits one of the crucial enzyme3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) which is essential for processing of viral RNA leads to disruption of viral replication process. However, the SARS-CoV-2 is devoid of C2-symmetric pocket which is the major target of HIV protease inhibitors. Hence, raised several questions on the potency and efficacy of this combination (8).

## (s5) Nitazoxanide:
(p5.0) It is an antiviral agent with broad-spectrum of activity against influenza and other respiratory viral infections. It was highly prescribed and used during Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. It was one of the drugs under anti-protozoal class for the treatment of intestinal infection caused by protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum (registered in US as immediate release formulation) and Giardia intestinalis. Apart from the specific use it is general broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent use widely in south-east Asia (9). Though the mechanism of action is not fully understood but it selectively targets the viral haemagglutinin maturation process and block it at posttranslational stage in influenza viruses. It is also reported that it improves the natural innate immunity of host against viruses like HIV, rotavirus, and coronavirus (10).
