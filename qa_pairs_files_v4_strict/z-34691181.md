## (s0) Simple umbrella reviews
(p0.0) Umbrella reviews ( Figure 1) are systematic reviews that consider many treatment comparisons for the management of the same disease or condition. Each comparison is considered sep ar ately, and meta-analyses are performed as deemed appropriate. Umbrella reviews are clusters that encompass many reviews. For example, an umbrella review presented data from 6 reviews that were considered to be of sufficiently high quality about nonpharmacological and nonsurgical interventions for hip osteoarthritis. 9 Ideally, both benefits and harms should be juxtaposed to determine trade-offs between the risks and benefits. 10 Few past reviews are explicitly called "umbrella reviews." However, in the Cochrane collaboration, there is interest to assemble already existing reviews on the same topic under umbrella reviews. Moreover, many reviews already have features of umbrella reviews, even if not called umbrella reviews, if they consider many interventions and comparisons.
