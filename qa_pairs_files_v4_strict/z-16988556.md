## (s12) Bayesian approach:
(p12.0) This is a supervised and parametric approach, where the data are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution, where mean and covariance are estimated from the training data set [57]. This method combines a graph-based algorithm and Bayesian model and segments the edema in addition. Also it can be extended to vectorial variables to operate on multi-modality images. A Bayesian network is a model of compound probability distribution function of a set of variable like directed acyclic graph with a probability table for each node. The nodes in a Bayesian network depends upon different variables in a domain, and the arcs between nodes represent the dependency relationships among the variables with probability [57]. First introduce some terms are very shortly written. Prior probability is the probability determined by the historic materials or the judgment of somebody. Since this kind of probability is not validated by experiment, it is called prior probability. Posterior probability is the probability which revised according to Bayesian equation and new features achieved by analysis thus the total probability theorem if A can be only influenced by factors B i . B j = Ø (i≠j), P(B i ) > 0, i = 1, 2,…then it have: P(A) = ∑ P(B i )P(A/B i ) Bayesian Equation is also called posterior probability equation because in this probability distribution some other investigations are needs. If the prior probability is P(B i ) and the additional information obtained by investigation is P(A|B i ), where i = 1,2,…, n, then the probability is:
