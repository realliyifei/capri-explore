## (s2) EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF AKI: LIMITATIONS OF SCR AND THE ROLE OF NEW BIOMARKERS
(p2.0) The high incidence (13-18% in hospitalized patients) and the serious complications of AKI, combined with the inability of current markers to diagnose AKI in an early and reversible stage in order to take corrective measures, led nephrologists to examine possible biomarkers of kidney damage to improve risk assessment, early detection, differential diagnosis and prognosis of AKI [23]. Even though the definition and diagnosis of AKI are still based on serum creatine increase and/or diuresis decrease, certain characteristics limit their diagnostic value. Limitations of sCr as a marker of kidney injury include modulation by age, gender, hydration status, diet, muscle mass and medication [24]. Furthermore, in the AKI setting, there is a considerable time difference between actual renal injury, actual GFR changes and increases in sCr [25] that inhibit accurate estimation regarding the timing of renal injury and the associated reduction in renal function. Thus a severe renal injury may be combined with relatively small sCr changes in the first 24Ã€48 h after AKI, leading to a false sense of security resulting in delayed therapeutic actions. All of the above decrease the utility of sCr as a tool for making treatment decisions in critically ill patients or in patients during the post-operative period, such as the decision to change nephrotoxic drugs or measures to increase renal perfusion [23].

(p2.1) As a result, in recent years, through the understanding of the biochemical, structural and functional changes caused by AKI, a set of new biomarkers for AKI was proposed. These substances are either low-molecular weight proteins that are freely filtered from the glomerulus and fully reabsorbed by the proximal tubule or proteins of normal tubular cells [24]. In cases   of parenchymal kidney damage, the normal uptake and metabolism of these substances are substantially disturbed, thus their concentration in urine or even serum may increase rapidly and significantly. Also, this increase may occur long before that of the routine indicators used for renal function estimation, i.e. sCr. The main characteristics of the most widely used urine/serum biomarkers with proven correlation to AKI are presented in Table 2 [26].
