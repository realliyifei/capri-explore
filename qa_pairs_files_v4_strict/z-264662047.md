## (s2) Structure of HIF-1
(p2.0) HIF-1 (Fig. 1) is a heterodimer made up of 2 subunits: HIF-1α, which is expressed constitutively, and HIF-1b is a member of the protein family known as basic helixloop-helix-Per-ARNT-Sim. [16]HIF-1α is composed of the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD), which confers oxygen-dependent regulation, the bHLH and PAS domains (PAS-A and PAS-B), which are necessary for dimerization and DNA binding, as well as 2 independent transcriptional activation domains, the N-and C-terminal transactivation domains (N-TAD and C-TAD), which are separated by an inhibitory domain. [17]nuclear localization signals -N(N-NLS) and nuclear localization signals -C (CNLS), 2 nuclear localization signals, are also present in HIF-1α.Whereas the N-terminal NLS appears to be less significant, the C-terminal NLS is essential for the nuclear import of HIF-1α.Due to its structural similarity, the HIF-1b component plays a crucial role in a number of transcriptional processes and is essential for HIF-1 DNA binding and transactivation.
