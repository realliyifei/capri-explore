## (s3) Electronic Properties
(p3.0) The electronic structure of uranium is dominated by 5f electron states that form narrow bands that tend to bond the atoms in complex and distorted ways. DFT results reveal that 5f orbitals are active in the chemical bonding for uranium [11]. The behavior of 5f electrons of uranium is observed to be similar to that of the d orbital electrons in the transition elements [12]. Compared with the bulk atoms, the deficit of atoms near the uranium surface breaks the balance between the delocalization and localization of 5f electrons, leading to the electrons changing from delocalized to localized. As the electrons change from delocalized to localized, the arrangement of the surface atoms is interrupted and the total energy of the surface increases. This principally leads to a high surface energy, in turn leading to a high affinity for hydrogen, oxygen and carbon [11,13].
