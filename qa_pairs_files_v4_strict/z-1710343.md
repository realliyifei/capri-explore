(p14.0) Five out of 10 SRs 27-31 included physically frail populations. From these SRs, 4 RCTs 33-38 (described in 6 articles) were included; three articles [33][34][35] described different aspects of the same study (the Frailty Intervention Trial -FIT), so that they are reported together here. Again, the main reason of exclusion was the use of varied nonstandard definitions of frailty (Supplementary material 3). The number of patients included in these trials ranged from 32 to 241. All trials included participants over 70 years old, except one study performed in nursing homes, that included patients aged over 85 years. 36 One trial included only women. 38 The study characteristics are described in Table 5. In general, risk of bias was low, except for blinding of participants (Table 6).
