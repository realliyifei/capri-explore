## (s6) Reynolds number dependence
(p6.0) In standard wind-tunnel measurements, a sole discrepancy in Reynolds number at otherwise similar conditions can lead to a difference in results. The effect of a varying Reynolds number on the noise generated was investigated by Ahlefeldt [62]. Here, acoustic measurements were performed on a small-scale aircraft model in high-lift configuration at both a real-flight Reynolds number and a lower Reynolds number corresponding to the standard wind-tunnel conditions. Measurements were performed in the European Transonic Wind tunnel (ETW) which, due to its pressurized and cryogenic environment, enabled a variation of Reynolds number up to real-flight Reynolds numbers. Other parameters were kept unchanged. Thus, Reynolds number effects on aeroacoustic behavior were separated from the effects of model fidelity and Mach number M. Several sources with significant Reynolds number dependence were found and exemplary differences at selected Strouhal numbers are shown in Fig. 2. Several dominant sources can be found at the real-flight Reynolds number, but are not present at standard conditions. Contrary to that, sources are present in the standard measurement but not at the real-flight Reynolds number, as can be seen for example in the slat region. Locally integrated sources from the slat and the flap are shown in Fig. 3. The strong tonal components in the spectrum in the slat region measured at the standard wind-tunnel conditions (lower Reynolds number) disappeared at real-flight Reynolds numbers.

LLM judge: NO

The content primarily meets the criteria but includes references to non-textual elements ("Fig. 2" and "Fig. 3") that it relies on for a complete understanding of the results discussed. This makes it difficult to frame a question that summarizes the content without access to the full visual data. The requirement for the content to be self-contained and understandable without external references or access to the full paper is not fully met due to these references to figures.

## (s70) Reynolds number dependence
(p70.0) In standard wind-tunnel measurements, a sole discrepancy in Reynolds number at otherwise similar conditions can lead to a difference in results. The effect of a varying Reynolds number on the noise generated was investigated by Ahlefeldt [62].

LLM judge: NO

The content suggests reference to non-textual elements ("as shown in Fig. 2", "shown in Fig. 3") that are integral to understanding and evaluating the results and methods discussed, failing criterion 1 and 3. This makes it difficult to formulate a complete, self-contained question as per criterion 5, since the reader cannot access or infer the detailed results or the comparisons made in the figures mentioned. Moreover, the text references external works without providing a comprehensive context or summarizing the findings, potentially compromising the criteria for being self-contained and providing comprehensive context (criteria 5 and 2, respectively).
