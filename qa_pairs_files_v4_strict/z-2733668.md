## (s11) Ranibizumab Plus Prompt or Deferred Laser or
(p11.0) Triamcinolone Plus Prompt Laser for Diabetic Macular Edema (DRCR.net Protocol I Study). In 2010, DRCR network published the first results of a trial comparing sham injections plus prompt laser, 0.5 mg ranibizumab plus prompt laser, 0.5 mg ranibizumab plus deferred laser (24 or more weeks), or 4 mg triamcinolone plus prompt laser in 854 study eyes with visual acuity of 20/32 to 20/320. At 1-year followup, sham injections plus prompt laser and triamcinolone plus prompt laser achieved the lowest results in terms of mean change in the VA letter score from baseline: +3 and +4, respectively; on the contrary, ranibizumab groups gained a mean of +9 letters in this period of time. In the subset of pseudophakic eyes at baseline, visual acuity improvement in the triamcinolone plus prompt laser group was similar to that in the ranibizumab groups [25]. The expanded 2-year results reported were similar to these results [26].
