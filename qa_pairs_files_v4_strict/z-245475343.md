## (s27) Important Correlation of Power Factor and Lattice Thermal Conductivity
(p27.0) The individual and synergetic methods are of great importance to boost the electrical and thermal properties of TE materials [160]. Table 5 summarizes the synthesis methods and approaches used to simultaneously increase power factors and reduce thermal conductivity in SnSe materials. New concepts like band-alignment and nanostructure with compositional alloys offer an intelligent way of reducing lattice thermal conductivity while retaining a high power factor. In 2019, the power factor of polycrystalline SnSe was strengthened by Ge alloying and Ag doping to 1 mWm −1 K −2 . Consequently, a peak zT value of approximately 1.5 was reached at 793 K. The carrier concentration was increased by Ag doping, while the Seebeck coefficient was increased by Ge alloying due to enhancing the effective band mass and reducing the bandgap. Furthermore, Ge alloying greatly decreased lattice thermal conductivity via scattering phonons due to point defects [98].
