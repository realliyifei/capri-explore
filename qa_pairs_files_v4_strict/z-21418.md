## (s16) B. RF Energy Harvesting
(p16.0) RF energy harvesting, also known as wireless power transfer (WPT), allows receivers to harvest energy from received RF signals [14], [15]. 2) Improving the efficiency of WPT: Despite the advantages of WPT, the system performance is basically constrained by the low energy conversion efficiency and the severe path loss during WPT [16]. Generally, the 5G techniques that are able to improve the performance of a wireless communication link can also be exploited to improve the efficiency of WPT. For example, narrow beams can be realized by employing multiple antennas at the transmitter side with optimized beamforming vectors, which is known as energy beamforming [15] and this fits well the applications of M-MIMO and mmWave. In addition, short range communication based 5G techniques such as D2D communications and UDNs are capable of improving the efficiency of WPT by reducing the energy transfer distance. Besides improving the amount of harvested energy, the circuit power consumed by information decoding is also an important design issue since it reduces the net harvested energy that can be stored in the battery for future use. In particular, the active mixers used in conventional information receivers for RF to baseband conversion are substantially power-consuming. This motivates additional efforts on designing novel receiver architectures that consume less power by avoiding the use of active devices.
