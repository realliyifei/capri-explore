## (s2) Earlier methods
(p2.0) The earliest known spatiotemporal gait recognition techniques were published during the 90s. Niyogi et al. [22] proposed to recognise gait at a sagittal angle with the subject walking frontoparallel. It is a template-based method which modelled the human gait in the form of a set of spatiotemporal snakes [39] from the slices of the moving parts of the human contour along the time domain. They expressed the spatiotemporal dimensions as XYT signifying the 2D (x, y) spatial coordinates varying with respect to time t. The recognition they have obtained with 26 image sequences across five human subjects reaches up to 83%.
