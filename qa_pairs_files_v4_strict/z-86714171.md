## (s2) CLASSIFICATION
(p2.0) Classification is a supervised learning technique which places the document according to content. Text classification is largely used in libraries. Text classification or Document categorization has several applications such as call center routing, automatic metadata extraction, word sense disambiguation, e-mail forwarding and spam detection, organizing and maintaining large catalogues of Web resources, news articles categorization etc. For text classification many machine learning techniques has been used to evolve rules (which helps to assign particular document to particular category) automatically [1]. Text classification (or text categorization) is the assignment of natural language documents to predefined categories according to their content. Text classification is the act of dividing a set of input documents into two or more classes where each document can be said to belong to one or multiple classes. Huge growth of information flows and especially the explosive growth of Internet promoted growth of automated text classification [4].
