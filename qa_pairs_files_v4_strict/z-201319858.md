## (s13) Invasiveness
(p13.0) Our sample contains eight studies written on the invasiveness of giant reed (see Table 8). Albers, et al. [53] analysed the role of restoration and key ecological invasion mechanisms in optimal spatial-dynamic management of invasive species, including giant reed. By using a bioeconomic modelling approach, their results suggest that more aggressive invasive species and more invasion-susceptible ecosystems require greater investment in habitat restoration despite its relative expense. Barney and DiTomaso [54] analysed the invasive characteristics of switchgrass, giant reed and Miscanthus in the United States. Switchgrass was found to be highly invasive in California, giant reed in Florida, while Miscanthus was not found to be invasive. The authors propose a screening procedure to provide reasonable assurance that bioenergy crops, including giant reed, pose a minimal risk of damaging the local environment.
