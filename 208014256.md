THE ROLE OF SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN CHANGING THE HEALTH-PROMOTING EFFECT OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT: A COMMUNITY SURVEY



becoming members as well as continuing their membership. Twenty six percent of the sample were men, age ranged from 50-95, 30% lived alone and 58% believed that their health was very good. Data were coded by three researchers with discrepancies resolved by discussion to refine the codes. Three categories were identified: instrumental, social, and altruistic. The most frequent reason for joining was instrumental (35%) where the member wanted the services provided by the Village. It was also the most frequent reason for continuing membership (57%). An analysis was also conducted to examine predictors of reasons for joining and continuing membership in the Village. These included, age, gender, health, and living alone. Results indicate that men were less likely to join or continue their membership for instrumental reason compared to women, and members who live alone were more likely to become a member for social reasons. When age at entrance into the Village was examined, each increasing year of age was associated a .01 increase in the probability of continuing as a member for instrumental reasons. Findings provide guidance in issues related to sustaining membership in a Village. Socioemotional selectivity theory positis that when we feel our time as limited, when a person ages, emotion based goals become a priority (Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999). Although previous studies have shown that all age groups benefit from a connection to nature (CN; Bisceglia, Perlman, Schaack, & Jenkins, 2009;Han, 2008;Mayer et al., 2009), there have been no studies conducted to determine if there are age differences in CN and how that relation contributes to positive affect. Analyses were conducted with a sample size of 152 participants with an average age of 37.55 years (SD = 15.64; Range 18 -89). Age was significantly positively associated with CN, r(151)=.16, p<.05. Additionally, an ANOVA showed that middle-aged to older adults reporting significantly higher CN than younger adults. The relation of positive affect to age and CN was then examined. In the analysis examining the effects of age and CN on positive affect, the model was significant, F(3, 146)=8.48, p<.05, R2 = .15. Both, CN, and age, uniquely contributed to the variance accounted for on positive affect, although, the interaction of CN and age did not uniquely contribute to the variance. These results may be indicative of socioemotional selectively theory, in that older adults were choosing connection to nature because it fulfilled more emotional activities/ goals than the younger adults in the study. Because previous research has all but ignored the association of CN and age and their relation to positive affect, it should be considered in future research.

Melissa Krook, 1 and Peter Vitaliano 1 , 1. University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States U.S. economic loss from natural disasters hit an all-time high in 2017 with 16 climate events totaling $306 billion. However, disasters' costliest effects may result from emotional and psychosocial health. Research suggests those who are: seniors, distressed, and/or experience early-life vulnerabilities have increased risk for negative health responses. This study addresses the need to reduce vulnerability/increase preparedness by evaluating how older adults (OA) perceive/ prepare for disasters, including influential psychological factors. Literature review results indicate OA are: (1) among our most vulnerable populations for disasters, (2) underprepared, though resources are available, and (3) preparing friends/ family before themselves. The Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST) posits: alongside aging, time perceptions become constrained, motivations shift, and we prefer positive over negative information. Therefore, I asked: (1) if OA are intuitively resistant to negative information, like impending disasters, how might we reframe it to align with their desire for positive information? (2) If we approach OA through positive experiences, will they be motivated to prepare? I employed a model: preparedness behavior (PB) is a function of vulnerability (V) and resilience (R). A survey was developed to assess how factors of V and R would interact/influence PB. I will pilot test this survey through evaluating communityliving OA. PB is expected to be negatively related to V, positively related to R. This study extends disaster research by using psychological variables to predict preparedness and evaluating preparedness motivation using SST as a guiding framework. Results should increase knowledge about OA's disaster preparedness perceptions and factors to mitigate increased preparedness.

Previous research that studies the impact of built environment on health often attribute the enabling effects of environment on physical activity participation and opportunities for social interaction. Few studies have explored how the role of subjective feeling, such as the feeling of connectedness with the community, affects the association between built environment and physical and mental health. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 2,247 residents aged 50 years or above in five districts in Hong Kong. We tested the mediation effect of sense of community in the relationship between physical environment and health using the path analysis. We administered a questionnaire to assess the residents' perceived age-friendliness of outdoor spaces and buildings in the 278 Innovation inAging, 2019, Vol. 3, No. S1
