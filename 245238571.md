23Background 24 Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. Neuropathy 25 predisposes patients to diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) due to the loss of protective sensation and 26 associated deformities. Management of foot ulcers are multifactorial, but pressure offloading can be 27 considered as one of the most important aspects of management. According to IWGDF Guidelines, 28 2 non-removable knee-high offloading devices are recommended as the 1st line of treatment for these 29 ulcers. However, this is a very underutilised treatment modality. This study aimed to evaluate the 30 practitioner preferred offloading modalities and reasons for their preference. 31 32 Methods 33 This project was approved by the university's human research ethics committee. An online survey 34 was distributed amongst Australian podiatrist via an industry related social media group. The survey 35 collected simple demographical information, management strategies, preferred offloading modalities 36 for the management of diabetic foot ulcers and reasons for their preferred method.38Results39Sixty-three podiatrists completed the survey with the majority practicing in private clinics. All 40 practitioners treat diabetic foot ulcers regularly with most participants treating up to ten ulcer cases 41 per week and 14% of participants treating more than 20 ulcers per week. Contrary to the IWGDF 42 guidelines, standard therapeutic footwear was the most preferred method of management for the 43 treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, with ease of use reported as the main reason for practitioners using 44 this modality. Non-compliance to the use of non-removable knee-high offloading devices include 45 perceived patient non-compliance and poor tolerance.47Conclusion

## 48

This study shows that practitioners' offloading strategies do not adhere to the IWGDF guidelines. The 49 reasons for not adhering to the guidelines seems to be a clinical practicality rather than evidence-  


## 70

In Australia, a recent systematic review of the incidence of diabetic foot disease noted that the overall 71 incidence of diabetic foot disease is lower (1.5%) when compared with the rest of the world (4.8%).


## 72

However, the incidence of in-patient admissions due to foot ulceration is much higher than the rest of 73 the world, with diabetes related amputations being the highest amongst developed nations. A 74 conclusion made from this data was that Australia is doing well to prevent DFU but not in managing 75 them once they developed, resulting in high numbers of admissions and amputations due to diabetes 76 related complications (3).


## 77

In Australia, podiatrists are one of the key carers for DFUs. Podiatric management of DFUs include 78 sharp debridement of necrotic tissue, timely and appropriate wound dressings application, control of 79 the underlying disease process, footwear modification to off load pressure from the DFU, patient 80 education and self-care (4). Pressure offloading can be considered as one of the most important 81 aspects of DFU prevention and management (5).


## 82

Since 2008 the International Working Group on Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) produced evidence-based 83 guidelines to assist with the management of diabetic foot disease and it became the benchmark for 84 clinical practice standards (6). These guidelines are frequently reviewed and updated to include the 85 latest research findings with the latest update in 2019 (7). A section in the IWGDF Guidelines is 86 dedicated to the best practices for offloading of DFU with eight recommendations for the management 87 of DFUs. Non-removable knee-high devices are recommended as the first line of management for 4 non-infected and ischaemic DFU associated with neuropathy (7). A non-removable knee-high 89 offloading device refers to a Total Contact Cast (TCC) which consists of a close fitting plaster or 90 fiberglass cast covering the foot , extending up the leg and ends just below the knee; or an instant 91 Total Contact Cast (I-TCC) which consists of a prefabricated knee-high walking boot that is rendered 92 irremovable by wrapping the device with a layer of casting material.


## 93

TCCs have been considered the gold standard for managing plantar forefoot and midfoot ulcers 94 complicated by neuropathy. The ulcer healing rate using TCCs over a 12-week period was found to 95 be 89.5%, which was significantly higher than the healing rates when using removable walking boots 


## 99

(4.8%)(9). Another study by Raspovic and Landorf (2014) found that amongst podiatrists working in 100 high-risk foot settings in public hospitals, semi-compressed felt padding was most commonly used for 101 offloading, with TCCs being the third choice (10). Reasons for low utilisation of TCCs were attributed 102 to high cost, time to apply, fear of complications and lack of expertise (plaster technician) to apply the 103 TCC (11, 12).


# 105

In Australia, most practising podiatrists do not work in public settings with support for high-risk foot 106 conditions. Examples of these private practice or similar primary care settings include privately owned 107 podiatry clinics, aged care facilities and community clinics. Patients with DFUs will often be managed 108 by podiatrists working in these private and primary care settings. It is not known how patients with 109 DFUs are managed in these settings, specifically if IWGDF guidelines for offloading are adhered to.


# 111

As it is not feasible to collect data from every private primary care setting in Australia, the way 112 patients are managed may be inferred from practitioners' perception. This study aimed to survey the    10 -12 gathered data regarding participants' offloading preference and reasons. There were four 136 offloading modalities for participants to choose from and these were taken from the IWGDF guidelines 137 namelynon-removable knee-high offloading devices, removable knee-high offloading devices, 138 ankle-high removable devices, and standard therapeutic footwear (7). Question 13 sought 139 participants' thoughts regarding how DFU management can be improved in a primary care setting. As 140 participants were anticipated to be busy clinicians, the survey was kept short, taking no longer than 15 141 minutes to complete to encourage participation.

## Statistical Analyses


## 143

Participant data were analysed descriptively and quantitatively. All data was analysed using SPSS    Participants were asked to provide their reasons for their choice particularly their first choice.   


## 198

The study found that standard therapeutic footwear in conjunction with regular podiatry treatment was  


## 10

To understand the rationale behind current practices, this study also collected data regarding the 223 reasons behind the practitioners' ranking preferences.


# 225

Results from this study showed that convenience and accessibility strongly influenced the selection of 226 therapeutic footwear as the first choice of offloading modality. This implies that practitioners may have 227 felt that therapeutic footwear were more convenient and accessible to use. Standard therapeutic 228 footwear such as Darco, can be purchased from specialised shoe shops or ordered from local 229 suppliers, which would naturally make this modality more accessible to both practitioner and patient.


## 230

In addition, since most practitioners also provided regular wound debridement and dressing, this may    


## 249

The choice of a removable knee-high device was attributed to patient compliance and satisfaction.


## 250

Patients may be reluctant to use the non-removable device as this hinders them from their regular 251 activities, and practitioners may be seeking a compromise by using a removable device. Studies have 252 11

shown that patients spend 75% of the their active time not wearing their prescribed removable 253 offloading device reducing its effectiveness (17). Ironically, the patient's ability to indulge in regular 254 activity and be comfortable, which is seen as positive to the patient, is a hindrance to wound healing.


## 255

On the contrary, when using non-removable devices, patients cannot remove the device themselves.


## 256

This is termed 'forced compliance' (16). Non-removable devices slow the patient down by reducing 257 stride length and activity, thereby promoting wound healing (8).


## 258

To resolve this issue, the use of I-TCC may be suggested. A I-TCC is a removable knee-high boot, 259 that is rendered irremovable by wrapping it with a plaster cast after it has been fitted on the patients'  


## 300

The formation of multi-disciplinary community centres with services such as nursing services to 301 change wound dressings, diabetes care management and education, radiology, pharmacology, and 302 potentially plaster casting services may meet the needs of podiatrists and patients alike. These multi-303 disciplinary services can provide a one-stop service for patients to access a range of support services 304 and will serve podiatrists and other allied professionals in private practice within a catchment area.


## 305

Patients will be able to have faster and more convenient access to the community service compared 306 to being referred to a high-risk foot service within the hospital. Further qualitative studies need to be 307 done to find out a good model of care that is financially viable and meets the clinical needs of all 308 stakeholders.


# 310

Funding


## 13

Although not one of the top reasons, high cost of a device was identified as one of the reasons for 312 choosing a modality and the patients' ability to afford treatment over the long term will influence 313 practitioner's treatment choices. This results in sub-optimal care placing an economic burden on the 314 patient as well as the health system. The treatment of DFUs was reported to be a significant 315 economic burden on patients and the health care system with an annual expenditure of US$9 -13 316 billion in the US. By optimising care with evidence-based principals an annual cost savings of AUD 317 2.7 billion over 5 years can be generated (23).


## 318

Practitioners could educate patients on the concept of cost-effectiveness (higher cost over a short 319 period vs lower costs over a long period), and that evidence-based care will result in better outcomes, 320 be more cost-effective and even result in cost savings (24).


## 321

In   


50 based practice. Reasons for choosing a management strategy is multi-factorial (not just reducing 51 plantar pressures). Further studies may be required to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic 52 footwear in ulcer healing, taking into consideration other factors such as practitioner and patient 53 preference, clinical practicality, and access to support. Based on the findings, this study provides 54 suggestions on how to overcome the barriers that prevent podiatrist from adhering to the 55 recommendations of the IWGDF when selecting offloading devices in general clinical practice.


neuropathy (PN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, and it is 65 estimated to affect 50% of the diabetic population (1). PN predisposes patients to diabetic foot ulcers 66 (DFU) due to the loss of protective sensation and associated deformities. With the loss of sensation, 67 the individual is unable to feel pain or discomfort associated with excessive skin pressure and shear 68 from foot contact surfaces such as footwear, or the ground. This eventually results in a breakdown of 69 tissue, and finally an ulcer in the high-pressure area (2).

## 96 (
9665%) and post op shoes (58.3%) (8). However, this modality is extremely underutilised in clinical 97 practice. In a study to evaluate the effectiveness of a new wound dressing when used in conjunction 98 with TCCs, Thompson et al (2019) managed to only recruit 13 participants from a population of 270

was approved by the university human research ethics committee (HREC Number: XXX)123All participants provided electronic informed consent. The inclusion criteria were that participants must 124 be podiatrists currently registered with the Australian Health Practitioners Registration Agency 125 (AHPRA) and they treat at least 1 patient with DFU per week. They must also not be working in a 126 public hospital high risk foot facility.


online survey was created via Qualtrics™(Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA) and consisted of 13 mainly 129 multiple-choice questions. Some multiple choices questions had an 'others' choice which allows 130 participants to fill in free text, where their answers were not part of the list of options. These free text 131 options were evaluated as well. Questions 1-5 gathered data regarding the nature of the podiatrists' 132 work (e.g. private or public setting, post code etc) and average weekly number of patients seen with 133 DFUs. In Question 6 -9, participants were asked what modalities they used to treat DFUs (e.g. 134 patient education -verbal or written, sharp debridement, wound care etc) and their reasons. Question

of 63 complete responses were eligible for final review. Majority of the participants (59%) had 149 five years or less of work experience. 16% had 6 to 10 years of experience and 25% had more than 150 10 years. 50.8% of participants worked in multiple different clinical settings, ranging from private 151 podiatry clinics, public hospitals, and aged care. 31.7% were working in only private clinics, followed 152 by 11.1% in public hospitals (non high-risk foot specific), 4.8% in community centres and 1.were asked to list any of their management strategies used in treating patients with157 DFUs. Participants could choose more than one option. Looking at Figure 1, 61 practitioners provide 158 regular podiatric treatment (including wound debridement and dressing) in conjunction with other 159 treatment modalities. Other management include provision of semi-compressed felt padding and 160 strapping, alongside with referrals to their general practitioner or other health professionals, patient 161 education, providing other custom-made offloading devices and specialised wound dressings, as well 162 as referral for radiological investigations.

The treatment options 175 included non-removable knee-high offloading device, removable knee-high offloading device, 176 removable ankle high offloading device and standard therapeutic footwear.

## Figure 2 Figure 2 :

199 commonly used to treat DFU in a non-high-risk foot setting. This in not in line with IWGDF guidelines 200 that advise that standard therapeutic footwear should only be used when none of the other 201 recommended knee-high offloading devices are available. However, results from this study are 202 consistent with the findings of Wu et al (2008) who reported that 41% of practitioners use shoe 203 modifications as the preferred method for the treatment of DFU over the gold standard TCC (12). In 204 this study, it must be acknowledged that most of the practitioners worked in private non-high risk foot 205 settings, and it can be possible that the DFUs presented may be less severe, and therefore the 206 responses reflect the effective management of less severe plantar ulcers in patients with less 207 comorbidities. It is well documented that there are obvious disparities between the initial presentation 208 of DFU in public settings when compared with private. Patients in public services present with more209 severe DFU complicated by more significant comorbidities and socioeconomic factors (13). These 210 factors put these patients at a higher risk of complications and ultimate amputation. This study was a 211 survey of practitioner's preference of management and therefore, actual severity of presenting DFUs 212 and outcomes of care (healing rate) was beyond the scope of the study. Further research to evaluate 213 the effectiveness of the current practices by looking at healing rates and complications in private 214 practice is necessary.215With the increased severity of DFUs seen in public high-risk foot settings, it may be expected that a 216 survey focussing on practitioners in High-risk Foot Services may return a different set of responses.

## 217
However, a recent survey targeting podiatrists in high-risk foot services in Australia also reported the218 use of felt padding and therapeutic footwear as the primary treatment choice with non-removal 219 devices as only the 3 rd treatment choice (10). This may indicate that regardless of work setting, the 220 results from this survey are realistic and accurate, and reflect the practices of the podiatrists in 221 general.


231 necessitate regular inspection and wound dressing changes, which is possible with the use of 232 therapeutic footwear. Furthermore, removable devices are indicated for DFUs in the presence of 233 infection and ischaemia, further supporting the use of removable offloading devices (14).

## 234
Brem & Boulton (2004) stated that to effectively implement the use of TCC requires a skilled cast 235 technician and application and removal is a time-consuming process (15). Many private community-236 based podiatry clinics tend to have a broad scope of practice with a stronger focus on preventative 237 care and less on the active management of diabetic foot complications. Although the total patient 238 weekly load was not asked, the number of patients with DFUs may form a small proportion of total 239 weekly patient volume. As such, it may not be cost effective to employ a plaster technician for the 240 purpose of applying and removing the TCCs, which may reduce the accessibility of TCCs in a regular 241 clinical setting.242 243Practitioners who selected TCCs as their first choice acknowledged its efficiency in wound healing.


260foot. Like therapeutic footwear, the removable knee-high boot is commercially available and does not 261 require a skilled plaster technician to apply and remove. The I-TCC cannot be removed daily by the 262 patient but can be removed by the practitioner for routine wound care. The I-TCC was reported to be 263 as effective as TCCs in offloading and healing plantar ulcers (I-TCC = 94% vs TCC = 93%), cost less 264 than the TCC (I-TCC = US$145 vs TCC = US$811),(11, 12, 18, 19). and also has a significantly265 lower application time than the TCC (I-TCC = 2 minutes vs TCC = 15 minutes) (18). These results and 266 benefits were further confirmed in the extensive systematic reviews by IWGDF (2019) (7, 18). In 267 addition, in relation to infected wounds, the latest guidelines by IWGDF stated that non-removable 268 devices can benefit the healing of DFU with mild infections (7). I-TCC can play an important role when 269 dealing with infected wounds during early phases of care where the device can be left removable to 270 facilitate frequent wound inspection and monitoring of infections. As soon as the infection stabilised 271 and wound condition improved, the device can be converted to an irremovable device. The 272 introduction of the I-TCC may be a viable way to permit the optimal offloading of plantar ulcers within 273 the constraints of a regular clinical setting. For this to occur, continuing professional education for 274 clinicians is required, and this is supported by the findings of this study when practitioners responded 275 that more continuing education is required to ensure that clinicians remain up to date with wound 276 management research and techniques. 277 278 Suggestions for improvements to service 279 Participants reported 3 areas where service for high-risk foot can be improved, namely, more 280 continuing professional development, increased communication with multi-disciplinary teams and 281 increased funding for chronic DFUs. 12 283 Continuing Professional Development (CPD) 284 Data from this study shown that 59% of practitioners dealing with DFU patients have less than 5 years 285 working experience. This shows the importance of CPD. The podiatry association and other bodies 286 specialising in wound care (Advanced Practising High-Risk Foot Group) regularly conduct webinars 287 and sessions in this area. However, given the burn-out rate of podiatrists (20), including effects of 288 dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic (21), it may be unrealistic to expect clinicians to undertake 289 further training beyond that required for podiatry registration.


High-Risk Foot Teams and increased referral pathway to multidisciplinary 292 services 293 Currently most multidisciplinary high-risk foot services are in larger centres that make it inaccessible 294 to regional and rural patients and communication between clinicians can be limited. Recent COVID -295 19 restrictions placed a renewed emphasis on the use of telehealth and telemedicine. Even with 296 developments in technology, limitations in the accuracy and reliability remain. However, the use of 297 technologies have shown to be effective in assessing, monitoring, and teaching in the management 298 of diabetic foot disease (22), which may be useful for more experienced podiatrists to mentor less 299 experienced ones.

Suggestions for improvement 

190 

When asked what would be required to improve care for patients with DFUs, 34% felt that more 

191 

continuing professional education for practitioners to improve and update wound care management 




This is supported by literature that stated the healing rate for TCC was 90% with a mean time to245 

healing of 42 days compared to 32% and 65 days for the group with cushioned inserts in therapeutic 

246 

footwear (16). However, an equal number of participants chose removable knee-high devices as non-

247 

removable knee-high devices. High quality studies have shown that knee-high removable offloading 

248 

devices were up to 76% more effective in healing DFU when compared with therapeutic footwear (7). 




terms of funding for DFU management, the Australia Government and The National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) do recognise the financial burden of diabetic foot complications 323and provide funding for best-practice management, which include "TCC or other devices rendered 324 irremovable" via its Medical Benefit Scheme (MBS) (25). When asked what could be improved, many 325 practitioners stated that more funding for DFU management was required. It could be possible that 326 practitioners are not fully aware of how to access these funding schemes for patients to reduce the 327 financial cost of treatment. Incentivising cost-effective evidence-based wound care within MBS and listing evidence-based wound products on MBS will not only ease patients' financial burden but also save considerable costs for Australia's health system (23).Results from this study showed that standard therapeutic footwear, together with routine podiatric treatment is the preferred management modality of DFUs in private clinical settings. This was contributed to clinical practicality, and patient compliance. Given its popularity, the role of therapeutic footwear and ways to improve its efficacy in ulcer healing requires further investigation. This study highlighted some thoughts as to the reasons behind this practice and suggestions to help steer practitioners and patients towards the IWGDF recommendations. However, practitioner did report that the current practice is effective. This effectiveness may need further investigation in the form of outcome-based studies specific to the management of DFU in a private setting. Future local guidelines might have to take into consideration that the presentation of DFU in a private setting may be different when compared to public.Practitioners responded that they would like more specialised multidisciplinary community centres and funding to support optimal wound healing in patients with DFU within private health care settings. This may be a big ask from struggling healthcare systems. Smaller steps can be taken to improve the communication between multidisciplinary teams and practitioners with further development of telehealth services. The result of this study suggests a need for qualitative studies to find out how we can better support practitioners to optimally manage patients with DFUs.322
