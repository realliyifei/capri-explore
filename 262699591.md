In the past two decades, social media has become the central way for many people, organizations, institutions to communicate and share opinions, ideas, and information.A young individual on average spends 2-3 hours on social media, engaging in 6-7 applications, which has also dramatically increased during/ and after the pandemic.So far, there has been increasing evidence that social media influences behavior, including its own use.It has also been related with aggression towards self and others, and especially suicidal behaviour related (positively and negatively) with social media use has received growing academic and public interest.Excessive use of social media or addiction, exposure to negative content, stalking, cyberbullying and cybervictimization are among concepts which have an influence on (self-)aggressive behavior.Research has shown that adolescents are more vulnerable to cybervictimization than adults, and female adolescents, who spend more time on social media than males, are even more vulnerable, resulting in depressive and in some cases, suicidal ideation.Individuals in marginalized groups might also be more prone to be affected by excluding discourse or discriminatory posts.On the other hand, social media could serve as a coping mechanism given the possibilities for instant support from online networks, availability of psychoeducational resources and mental health related scientific content.Few meta-analyses in the field indicate the need to systematize sampling and data collection; while each pointing to the heterogeneity of the impact of social media.In this talk, the correlates of social media will be reviewed, and possible mental health-promoting approaches will be discussed.

Abstract: Introduction: Behavioral addictions (with related behaviors often conducted online) constitute new categories within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD).In both, gambling disorder is listed as a formal clinical diagnosis whereas disorders related to videogaming exist in the DSM (research criteria) and ICD (clinical criteria).However, a broader range of disorders related to other behaviors (e.g., shopping/buying, social media use, pornography use) have been proposed as possible behavioral addictions.Objectives: This presentation will provide insight in efforts by major organizations (e.g., the World Health Organization) to consider behavioral addictions and how best to screen for, assess and intervene to help people with these conditions.Empirical data influencing the classification of the behaviors and disorders will be presented.Changes in online behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic will be considered with respect to mental health concerns.Methods: Multiple methods ranging from results of neuroimaging studies, clinical trials, and longitudinal investigations will be presented.Results: Brain imaging results suggest similarities between specific internet-use behaviors (especially internet gaming disorder) and substance use disorders, supporting a classification as behavioral addictions.Multiple types of internet use increased during the pandemic, particularly during the onset.Different patterns of mental concerns in relation to internet use behaviors were seen during the pandemic.Consensus guidances regarding how best to avoid and address problematic use of the internet were developed and disseminated.Clinical trials support the efficacy of behavioral and neuromodulatory approaches, although no treatments have regulatory approval for behavioral addictions.Conclusions: Multiple internet-use behaviors may form the basis of behavioral addictions.While considerable data exist for internet gaming disorder, other behaviors commonly performed on the internet also warrant consideration.Additional research is needed to develop, test and implement more effective prevention and treatment strategies.

The prefrontal cortex: a region of interest in suicidal behaviour Abstract: Some evidence converges to consider that suicidal behaviour could be a separate diagnosis and emphasizes the relevance to identify specific biomarkers.Identifying the neural substrates of suicide attempt is key to understanding the etiology of suicide and might be helpful in reducing suicide rates among psychiatric patients by promoting the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on behavioral neuroscience and brain stimulation.Neuroimaging studies have reported structural and functional brain abnormalities located in the prefrontal cortex, insula and striatal regions as well as in the connections between these brain areas.Based on task related and resting state functional MRI studies, we will discuss original data showing the role of the ventral prefrontal cortex in suicide vulnerability.
