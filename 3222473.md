A listing of the major components of the HyperDiver system, along with their approximate cost and weight (in air).

## Supervised classification

Details and parameters of the algorithms used for supervised classification are provided here:

• Multi-layer Perceptron: 1 hidden layers with 30 neurons, logistic activation function, L2 penalty parameter 0.1, maximum iterations 2000.

• Support Vector Machine: linear kernel, squared hinge loss function, penalty parameter 1 with inverse proportional scaling with class frequency in training samples.

• Mahalanobis Distance classifier: distance threshold 0

can be higher than the between image variability (difference between means), such as for Isopora, Porites, Echinopora and Acropora. Sediment and Turf, which have similar spectral features, indicate different mean reflectances at the two altitudes. This is either a systematic annotation error, or a confoundment of categories.) altitudes. The 
thick lines are the average Z-normed spectra of the class pixels, and the shaded bands are 
the standard deviations. Observe the generally conserved location of spectral features in both 
altitude images. The systematically large variability in the near infrared (>700 nm) is an 
artifact of division of near-zero values to calculate reflectance. In other spectral regions, the
