## Introduction

Regardless of its still unclear origin (1), the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is dramatically disrupting the integrity and efficiency of most healthcare systems worldwide (2). An already critical situation has recently become even worse boosted by the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 lineages characterized by increased transmissibility, such as the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant (3), which is now responsible for a dramatic surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections all around the world due to a magnified capability to escape the host immune response (4). Such a tremendous increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections is causing a kaleidoscope of adverse consequences on clinical laboratories, many of which are no longer capable to withstand the pressure of performing enormous volumes of diagnostic tests with a suitable turnaround time. In keeping with this, a worldwide survey performed by the American Association of Clinical Chemistry (AACC) has evidenced that more than half of respondent laboratories declared that they were actually unable to purchase a sufficient number of tests to analyze all specimens received (5).

Although the reference approach for diagnosing an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection still encompasses the detection of viral RNA in a respiratory specimen by means of a nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), namely with (real-time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) (6), these methods are essentially time-consuming, have an intrinsically low throughput and required dedicated instrumentation and skilled personnel (7), thus paving the way to development and commercialization of immunoassays aimed at detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigens rather than RNA. Besides rapid diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection (RDT-Ag) (8), whose diagnostic performance are extremely heterogeneous and mostly unsuitable for replacing NAATs in most circumstances (i.e., the diagnostic sensitivity is typically low, around 60%) (9), laboratory-based, accurate and fully-automated SARS-CoV-2 antigen immunoassays have been proposed as possible solution to overcome the current testing backlog, shortage of supply and delayed generation of test results. Among the various methods, the novel Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test is a chemiluminescent immunoassay that has been specifically developed for supporting the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections. To this end, the present study is aimed at reviewing and summarizing the currently published information on the diagnostic accuracy of this novel fully-automated and highthroughput technique. We present the following article in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting checklist.


## Materials and Methods


## Immunoassay description

The Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ, USA) is a chemiluminescent immunoassay that has been developed for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein on fully-automated Ortho platforms (i.e., VIT-ROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System and VITROS 5600/XT 7600 Integrated Systems). The test been recently cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Briefly, the immunoassay involves a two-stage reaction. In the first step, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein present in the test sample reacts with coated monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. After removing unbound material from the test reaction chamber by washing, anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) are added to the reaction mixture. Unbound conjugate is eliminated by washing, whilst the HRPbound conjugate is measured with a luminescent reaction by adding a luminogenic substrate and an electron transfer agent to the reaction wells. The signal to cutoff ratio (S/C) proportionally increases with 1,00-1,00), respektivno, dok je povr{ina ispod krive bila 0,995 (95%CI, 0,9973-0). kumulativno slaganje 97,2% (95%CI, 96,5-97,8%), sa 0,89 (95%CI, 0,86-0,91) kapa statistike, {to odra`ava skoro savr{enu saglasnost sa referentnim tehnikama molekularne biologije. Objedinjena dijagnosti~ka osetljivost u uzorcima sa visokim virusnim optere}enjem bila je ~ak 0,98 (95% CI, 0,96-0,99). Zaklju~ak: Ovi rezultati potvr|uju da automatizovani i visoko propusni Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test mo`e predstavljati vredan surogat molekularnog testiranja za dijagnostikovanje akutnih SARS-CoV-2 infekcija, posebno kod subjekata sa visokim virusnim optere}enjem.

Klju~ne re~i: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, imunoesej, dijagnoza, antigen under the curve was 0.995 (95%CI, 0.993-0.997), the cumulative agreement 97.2% (95%CI, 96.5-97.8%), with 0.89 (95%CI, 0.86-0.91) kappa statistics, thus reflecting an almost perfect concordance with reference molecular biology techniques. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity in samples with high viral load was as high as 0.98 (95%CI, 0.96-0.99). Conclusions: These results confirm that the automated and high-throughput Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test may represent a valuable surrogate of molecular testing for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially in subjects with high viral load.

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, immunoassay, diagnosis, antigen the amount of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen present in the test sample, with reactivity (i.e., diagnostic positivity) set at ≥1 S/C threshold. The sample volume is just 80 mL, the turnaround time of the test is around 48 min, whilst the throughput (depending on the automated platform) ranges between 120 and 150 samples per hour.

According to manufacturer's specifications, the limit of detection ranges between 5.0×10 2 and 3.0×10 3 Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID 50 )/mL, the positive and negative percent agreement for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infections are as high as 80% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 57-88%) and 100% (95%CI, 95-100%), respectively. Other pre-analytical and analytical characteristics are not presented here for space constrains, but are thoroughly described in the package insert (10).


## Search strategy

The search strategy used in this study is summarized in Table I. Briefly, the electronic search was conducted in the two scientific databases Scopus and Medline (on PubMed interface) based on the keywords »VITROS« AND »antigen« AND »COVID-19« OR »SARS-CoV-2« AND »immunoassay« within the search fields »TITLE« AND »ABSTRACT« AND »KEY-WORDS«, without no date (i.e., up to January 23, 2022) or language restrictions, aimed at detecting potential documents which reported the diagnostic accuracy of Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test compared with reference molecular diagnostic methods. The two authors (G.L. and B.M.H.) assessed the title, abstract and full text (when available) of all items that could be detected based on the previously described search criteria, choosing clinical studies where the rates of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) cases were available for constructing a 2×2 table. All references of these selected articles were also assessed for identifying other potentially includible studies. A pooled analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel method was finally carried out, with the purpose of estimating the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (expressed as Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [SROC], agreement and Kappa statistics), with 95%CI and using a random effects model. Within studies heterogeneity was calculated using c 2 test and I 2 statistic. A second sub-analysis was conducted for assessing the diagnostic sensitivity of Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test in studies that reported this information in specimens with high viral load. The statistical analysis was performed with Meta-DiSc 1.4 (Unit of Clinical Biostatistics team of the Ramón y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain) (11). This pooled analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA Checklist available as Supplementary File 1), in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and within the terms of local legislation. No ethical committee approval was necessary, since this is a critical literature review.


## Results

The electronic search according to the predefined criteria allowed to identify 39 publications after eliminating duplicates among the two scientific databases. Thirty four of such document were not included since they did not present information on Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=23), were review articles (n=7), did not correlate test accuracy with a reference SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic technique (n=3), or were a case report (n=1). Overall, 5 studies (n=2734 samples) could finally be included in our pooled analysis (12)(13)(14)(15)(16).

The main aspects of these five studies are presented in Table II. Two studies were conducted in France, and one each in Canada, Japan and India. In four studies, nasopharyngeal swab only were used as reference diagnostic sample, whilst the remaining investigation used both oro-and naso-pharyngeal specimens (16).

16b Cite studies that might appear to meet the inclusion criteria, but which were excluded, and explain why they were excluded. viral load in the study samples varied between 9 and 39 cycle threshold (Ct) values, with a cumulative sample size between 128 and 1727 specimens. In 4/5 included studies, a sub-analysis of diagnostic sensitivity in specimens with high-viral load was available (n=261), as shown in Table III. In two of such studies the cut-off of high viral load was defined as Ct value ≤30, in one study as Ct value ≤25, and as ≥500 copies/reaction in the remaining study.

The results of cumulative pooled analysis of diagnostic accuracy of Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infections are summarized in Figure 1. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (95%CI, 0.78-0.86; I2, 63.5%) and 1.00 (95%CI, 1.00-1.00; I2, 0.0%), respectively, whilst the area under the SROC (AUC) was 0.995 (95%CI, 0.993-0.997), the diagnostic accuracy 97.2% (95%CI, 96.5-97.8%) with 0.89 (95%CI, 0.86-0.91) kappa statistics, thus reflecting an almost perfect agreement (17). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity of Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test in samples with high viral load is summarized in Figure 2, which allowed to calculate a pooled diagnostic sensitivity as high as 0.98 (95%CI, 0.96-0.99; I 2 , 62.1%).

## Discussion

Mass-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing and timely generation of test results are becoming compelling needs for providing optimal care and enabling an efficient contact tracing with new and highly transmissible variants such as Omicron (B.1.1.529) (18). Nonetheless, the paramount number of diagnostic tests that would be needed to face the ongoing »fourth« wave of the COVID-19 pandemic are clearly overwhelming the molecular testing capacity of most laboratories worldwide. Although a NAAT remains the gold standard for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, the recent development of accurate, fast and high-throughput laboratory-based immunoassays is an important avenue of consideration for supporting high-volume and rapid diagnostic responses (19). Among these methods, the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test represents a valuable alternative owing to the large diffusion of automated Ortho platforms in many clinical laboratories all around the world.

The results of this critical literature review of studies which evaluated this chemiluminescent immunoassay reveal that the pooled diagnostic accuracy is considerably high, as attested by the over 80% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 97.2% agreement with reference molecular techniques. These figures, which exactly match those claimed by the manufacturer (i.e., 80% and 100% percent positive and negative agreement, respectively), would make this method an important surrogate of molecular tests for purpose of mass (population) screening. This conclusion is further supported by the extremely high pooled diagnostic sensitivity (i.e., 98%) estimated in oro-and nasopharyngeal samples with high viral load. Notably, the cumulative diagnostic accuracy of this test seems to be even higher than that described for some similar immunoassays such as the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 antigen immunoassay (68% sensitivity, 99% specificity and 89% accuracy, respectively) (20), the DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag test (31% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 50% accuracy, respectively) (21), and globally comparable to those of a high-sensitivity immunoassay such as Fujirebio Lumipulse SARS-CoV-2 Ag test (87% sensitivity, 97% specificity and 96% accuracy, respectively) (22).

It has now been clearly established that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are driven by the so-called »super-carries«, who incidentally become also »superspreaders« in specific circumstances (i.e., limited or absence of physical protection during prolonged indoor contacts in schools, airports, stations, restaurants, bars and other public places, as well as during mass gatherings such as sports events, concerts, public manifestations and so forth) (23). Several lines of evidence now attest that these »super-spreaders« would disproportionately concur to generate a huge number of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions and infections (24), in that less than 20% of infected individuals may be responsible for over 80% of all new cluster transmissions (25), and with such risk being magnified when infected people shed SARS-CoV-2 at very high viral loads and share many close contacts (26). To this end, the availability of fast, accurate and highthroughput immunoassays capable to reliably identify subjects bearing high viral load not only may enable the rapid clinical management of those with suggestive symptoms needing timely and appropriate care, but would also allow to conduct extensive contact tracing, such that close contacts -especially those bearing high viral load -could be efficiently isolated, thus ultimately preventing or limiting further SARS-CoV-2 spread within the community. 


## Conclusion

The results of this critical review and pooled analysis of the literature confirm that the automated and high-throughput Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test represents a valuable surrogate of molecular testing for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially in subjects bearing a high viral load.
