Innovation in Aging

Dance movement therapy(DMT)is a physical and psychological intervention, but there was no meta-analysis of RCTs in the systematic review of DMT for dementia, and the results of RCTs were inconsistent. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of dance movement therapy on depression and anxiety of persons with dementia in comparison to no treatment, standard care. Six electronic databases (Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, EBSCO, CNKI) were searched through January 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Chinese and English language were considered, including: (1) population is women and men of all age with dementia and MCI; (2) intervention is dance movement intervention; (3) comparison is no treatment or standard care; (4) outcome is depression or anxiety. The four review authors independently reviewed studies on an abstract/title level and again after reading the full paper, and we independently evaluated methodological quality. Six randomized controlled trials were identified on depression and anxiety symptoms in persons with dementia. The target sample size was 29-842 older adults. Meta-analysis showed there were significant differences in favor of dance in depression (SMD = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.95, P = 0.003), but not in outcomes of anxiety. Trials of high methodological quality, large sample sizes, and clarity in the way the intervention is put together and delivered are needed to assess whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention on depression and anxiety for persons with dementia.

## INVOLVING PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA IN SOCIAL RESEARCH: A LITERATURE REVIEW

Pamela Manley, 1 and Candace Kemp, 2 1. Georgia State University/Gerontology Institute, Atlanta,Georgia,United States,2. Gerontology Institute,Georgia State University,Atlanta,Georgia,United States Abstract Studies involving persons with dementia as research participants have increased over the years, due in part to an emphasis on patient and public involvement in health care and participatory action research. Recent studies indicate a growing trend toward engaging persons with dementia, not only as participants, but also as co-researchers. Further, studies involving persons with dementia as co-researchers and advisers have garnered increased attention due to the inclusion of this population's unique perspectives and lived experiences. Theoretically, frameworks such as person-centered-and relationship-centered care, also influence and shape the research process. This literature review examines empirical research conducted over the past decade that reports the involvement of persons with dementia as research participants ("research on") and co-researchers and advisers ("research with"). Among the 27 articles identified, 12 reported "research on," and 15 reported "research with" persons with dementia. "Research on" targeted participants' emotional expressions/responses, engagement in exercise/activities; social environment influences, and cognitive training; whereas "research with," which was mostly qualitative, focused on co-researchers' perspectives of and experiences with the research process; needs, priorities, and recommendations in research planning; partnering with persons with dementia on the design and development of research instruments, and the importance of critically evaluating the research process. Findings documenting research challenges, complexities, and ethical concerns are also discussed. Overall, findings demonstrate the feasibility of involving persons with dementia in a meaningful way and further affirms that including them as co-researchers is not only beneficial, but has the potential to enhance the entire research process.

Syracuse University,Syracuse University,New York,United States,3. Syracuse University,Syracuse,New York,United States,4. Syracuse University,Syrcause,New York,United States Family caregivers of persons with dementia (PWDs) use social media to obtain and share health information. Yet relatively little is known about the types of information that these caregivers share. We address this gap by analyzing caregivers' posts (N = 401) in two subreddits, r/Alzheimers and r/ dementia, which represent two subgroups on the social media platform Reddit. Our research questions were as follows: (1) What are these caregivers' main purposes in posting? (2) What types of health information do the caregivers exchange online? (3) What are the characteristics of online posts that receive the caregivers' greatest attention? Content and correlational analyses revealed that over half of users (57%) posted regarding specific types of health information that they desired to seek and share, whereas the remaining users posted information for sharing only. The health information most commonly posted fell into the following three categories: psychosocial health information, information about patients' daily care, and characteristics of health conditions. The more health information types that a post contained, the greater the number of people who participated in the subreddit discussions. Further research should examine how social media meet PWD caregivers' needs for information support.
