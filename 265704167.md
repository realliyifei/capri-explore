2][3][4]Diabetes is a leading cause of visual impairment resulting from diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema.5In Canada, the incidence of diabetes fluctuated and the prevalence of dia betes increased 37.3% between 2003/04 and 2013/14.6In 2016/17, the number of people in Canada living with dia betes was 3.2 million, which increased to 5.7 million in 2022.7,8Contributing factors to this increase include people in Canada with diabetes now living longer and the growth and aging of the Canadian population.6iven the fastrising prevalence of diabetes, it is important to know whether the prevalence of visual impairment has also increased so that strategies and policies for prevention and management of visual impairment can be developed.We sought to assess time trends in visual impairment prevalence among people in Canada with and without diabetes from 1994/95 to 2013/14 and to determine whether the trends were similar among people in Canada with different levels of education and income.MethodsThis study was set in 10 Canadian provinces (Alberta,

## Data sources and participants

Data were from 7 cycles of nationwide surveys: the 1994/95, 1996/97 and 1998/99 cycles of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) and the 2000/01, 2008/09 Healthy Aging, 2009/10 and 2013/14 cycles of the Canadian Com munity Health Survey (CCHS).

The CCHS and NPHS (household crosssectional com ponent) are crosssectional surveys with participants ran domly selected across the country by Statistics Canada, using a multistage stratified cluster design with 1 person being selected per household. 9,10The NPHS targeted household residents of all ages and the CCHS targeted Canadians aged 12 years and older living in private dwell ings, except for the CCHS 2008/09 Healthy Aging, which targeted Canadians aged 45 years and older.Data in NPHS and CCHS were collected using computerassisted inter views.][12][13][14][15] Only respondents aged 45 years and older were included since visual impairment is an agerelated condition and the CCHS 2008/09 Healthy Aging included only individuals aged 45 years and older. 16


## Outcome measure

8][19] The HUI3 has a reliability of κ = 0.728. 17Although visual impairment was not clinically meas ured, it is the individual's presenting or habitual vision, not their bestcorrected visual acuity measured in the ideal clinic settings, that reflects their reallife vision challenges. 20,21he HUI3 asks the following questions: • Are you usually able to see well enough to read ordinary newsprint without glasses or contact lenses?• Are you usually able to see well enough to read ordinary newsprint with glasses or contact lenses?• Are you able to see at all? • Are you able to see well enough to recognize a friend on the other side of the street without glasses or contact lenses?• Are you usually able to see well enough to recognize a friend on the other side of the street with glasses or contact lenses?Replies were categorized by Statistics Canada into 5 mu tually exclusive groups: 18 (i) no visual problems; (ii) problems cor rected by lenses (distance, close or both); (iii) problems seeing distance not corrected; (iv) problems seeing close not cor rected; and (v) problems seeing close and distance not corrected, or no sight at all.

In this analysis, vision problems not corrected by lenses for close vision, distance vision, or both, or no sight at all (i.e., the combination of groups [iii], [iv] and [v]) were consid ered as having selfreported visual impairment.Groups (i) and (ii) were categorized as not having selfreported visual impairment.


## Diabetes measure

Participants who selfreported that they had (or did not have) diabetes diagnosed by a health professional were considered as having diabetes (or not having diabetes).


## Other measures

Information on the highest level of education attained by par ticipants was obtained through a series of questions and was categorized by Statistics Canada into 4 levels: (1) less than sec ondary school graduation; (2) secondary school graduation, no postsecondary; (3) some postsecondary education; and (4) postsecondary certificate/diploma or university degree.We further consolidated participants into low ( [1] and [2] above) and high ( [3] and [4] above) levels to avoid sparse data.Infor mation on total household income was collected by Statistics Canada via income categories or an estimate.We grouped the income data into low (below middle) and middle-high (mid dle or higher) levels for adequate data analysis.


## Statistical analysis

We calculated prevalence estimates by diabetes status and level of education and household income.Survey weights generated similarly by Statistics Canada for the NPHS and CCHS were used in all analyses to adjust for various factors. 23Weighted prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were directly age and sexstandardized to the 2016 Canadian census to allow for valid comparisons. 24For analyses stratified by edu cation and income, only sexstandardized prevalence was calcu lated owing to sparse data not meeting the data release rules and questionable test results when stratifying by both age and sex.We calculated standard errors and 95% CIs of prevalence estimates using the bootstrap weights with 500 subsamples drawn by Statistics Canada.Owing to small cell sizes, the 1994/95 and 1996/97 cycles of the NPHS and the 1998/99 and 2000/01 cycles of the NPHS and CCHS were combined (termed 1994~1997 and 1998~2001, respectively) for calculat ing overall prevalence estimates and educationstratified esti mates. 25For similar reasons, the 1998/99 cycle of the NPHS was combined with the 2000/01 cycle of the CCHS for calcu lating incomestratified estimates.Standardized prevalence ratios and 95% CIs were calculated to compare the visual impairment prevalence in 2013/14 versus the combined 1994~1997 data. 26We assessed additive and multiplicative interaction for education-diabetes and income-diabetes on visual impairment prevalence. 27Answers of "Don't know" or "Refuse" were treated as missing values.


## Ethics approval

Statistics Canada obtained informed consent from all survey participants.The University of Toronto Research Ethics Board approved this study (no.36562).


## Results

The characteristics of participants are shown in The age and sexstandardized prevalence of visual impair ment among people with and without diabetes is shown in Figure 1.In all survey years, visual impairment prevalence was about 2 times higher among people with diabetes than those without.Overall, a decreasing visual impairment prevalence was observed among the groups with and without dia betes.Among those with diabetes, the visual impairment prevalence decreased from 7.37% (95% CI 5.31%-9.43%) in the com bined 1994~1997 to 3.03% (95% CI 2.48%-3.57%) in 2013/14, giving a standardized prevalence ratio of 0.41 (95% CI 0.30-0.56)for 2013/14 versus the combined 1994~1997.Among those without diabetes, the visual impairment preva lence decreased from 3.72% (95% CI 3.31%-4.14%)in the combined 1994~1997 to 1.69% (95% CI 1.52%-1.87%) in 2013/14, with a standardized prevalence ratio of 0.45 (95% CI 0.40-0.52)for 2013/14 versus the combined 1994~1997.

Figure 2 shows a decreasing visual impairment prevalence in all subgroups stratified by level of education and diabetes status from 1994 to 2014.In the loweducation stratum, the sexstandardized prevalence of visual impairment decreased from 9.96% (95% CI 6.91%-13.02%) in the combined 1994~1997 to 3.57% (95% CI 2.84%-4.29%) in 2013/14 for those with diabetes, and from 4.16% (95% CI 3.52%-4.79%)in the combined 1994~1997 to 2.18% (95% CI 1.87%-2.48%) in 2013/14 for those without diabetes.In the high education stratum, the visual impairment prevalence similarly  2 also shows that the sexstandardized prevalence of visual impairment was highest in people with low education levels and diabetes, and lowest in those with high education levels and no diabetes in all survey years.Evaluations of inter actions regarding the joint effects of low levels of education and having diabetes on visual impairment prevalence are shown in Table 2.In 2013/14, the observed standardized prevalence ratios for the joint presence of low level of education and diabetes were smaller than the expected standardized prevalence ratio from both the additive (2.36 v. 2.82) and multiplicative model (2.95 v. 4.56), indicating the presence of negative additive and negative multiplicative interaction.However, positive additive inter actions were present in other years for education-diabetes on visual impairment prevalence.Multiplicative interactions were negative in 3 of 5 and not present in 2 of 5 assessments.

After stratification by household income level and diabetes status, a decreased visual impairment prevalence over time was observed (Figure 3).The highest sexstandardized prevalence of visual impairment was found in Canadians with low level of income and diabetes, and the lowest was found in those with middle-high level of income and no diabetes in all survey years.Evaluations of interactions between the joint presence of low level of household income and diabetes on visual impairment prevalence are shown in Table 2.In 2013/14, there was evi dence of positive additive interaction (standardized prevalence ratio observed 3.39 v. expected 2.86).However, negative addi tive interactions were observed for other years (e.g., 2008/09).The visual impairment prevalence among those with miss ing household income data showed a similar decreasing trend over time (Appendix 1, Supplementary Table S1, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/11/6/E1125/suppl/DC1).

The visual impairment prevalence stratified by age, educa tion (or household income), and diabetes status are presented in Appendix 1, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.


## Interpretation

This study assessed visual impairment trends among people in Canada with and without diabetes over 2 decades.We report that whereas the number of participants who reported having diabetes nearly tripled from 1994/95 to 2013/14, the proportion of people with visual impairment decreased among those with and without diabetes.Adjusting for age and sex, visual impairment prevalence decreased by more than half (standardized prevalence ratio 0.41 for those with dia betes and 0.45 for those without).However, in 2009/10 and 2013/14, the visual impairment prevalence seems to have level ed off (Figure 1).Sexadjusted analyses stratified by edu cation and income levels also showed a decreasing trend from 1994 to 2014.Furthermore, we report the visual impairment prevalence was about 2 times higher among people with dia betes than those without in all survey years.The highest visual impairment prevalence was found in people with diabe tes and low levels of education or income, and the lowest was found among those without diabetes and with middle-high levels of education or income.In 2013/14, a positive additive interaction between diabetes and low levels of household income on visual impairment prevalence was noted, suggest ing that visual impairment interventions targeting those with diabetes and low levels of income may yield a benefit larger than expected.However, this additive interaction varied by year.Caution should be taken when applying this strategy to the most recent years.The decreased prevalence of visual impairment we report complements other reports of visual impairment. 28,29In Europe, a metaanalysis involving individuals aged 55 years and older reported that prevalence of visual impairment decreased from 2.22% in 1991-2006 to 0.92% in 2007-2012. 28Another metaanalysis similarly reported that the age adjusted prevalence of visual impairment decreased from 1990 to 2015 globally. 29However, these reports did not distinguish between people with and without diabetes, and used pooled data from countries with different health care systems.In 2022, Purola and colleagues reported that the visual impair ment prevalence and incidence due to diabetic retinopathy in the Finish population peaked in the 1990s and decreased from 1996 to 2019. 30Using Canadian data, we report that visual impairment prevalence decreased among people with and without diabetes from 1994 to 2014, irrespective of their level of education and income.9][50] Despite


## Limitations

This study has limitations.We described visual impairment trends based on data from crosssectional surveys at differ ent times.Estimates from combining cycles represent an "artificial" population made up of populations surveyed at different times. 25][53][54][55] Selfreported diabetes has excellent specificity (87.8%-98.6%)7][58] Extrapolating the reported moderate sensitivity to people in Canada entails mis classification of some individuals with diabetes as not having diabetes, causing an overestimation of visual impairment prevalence among people in Canada without diabetes.We are not aware that the validity of selfreported diabetes changes with time.Therefore, misclassification of selfreported dia betes would likely not affect the decreasing trend reported.

Selfreported diabetes cannot distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The analysis excluded individuals residing in the 3 terri tories, those living on reserves and those not in private dwell ings.The most recent available data on visual impairment is from the CCHS 2013/14 owing to survey content changes.Consequently, our conclusions may not be generalizable to Canadians living in the 3 territories or Indigenous commun ities, nor would they be applicable if extrapolated beyond 2014.Nonetheless, our results provide a valuable 20year his torical perspective for future comparisons.

Whereas we observed trends in visual impairment preva lence by age, we could not agestandardize prevalence of visual impairment when comparing by levels of education and income owing to sparse data.Our estimates for education and income should be interpreted with caution.

There may have been a few individuals who were ran domly selected to participate in more than 1 survey cycle.Pooling the NPHS 1994/95 and 1996/97 cycles may have resulted in the inclusion of some repeat participants between 2 cycles.However, the chance of being selected for multiple surveys is low and the possibility of rejecting par ticipation in multiple surveys, if selected, is high because of the burdens of answering the long questionnaire.In addi tion, survey weights were used to represent different groups in the population across different cycles.These factors may minimize the impact of repeated participation in surveys by the same respondents.


## Conclusion

Visual impairment prevalence in Canada is higher among people with diabetes than those without, and decreased from 1994 to 2014 overall.The decreasing trend was observed in all subgroups stratified by diabetes-education and diabetes-income but was attenuated in 2009/10 and 2013/14.Efforts for visual impairment reduction should continue to focus on diabetes edu cation, prevention, treatment and diabetic eye examinations.
