A Walker n-manifold is a semi-Riemannian n-manifold, which admits a field of parallel null r-planes, with r ≤ 2 n .It is well-known that semi-Riemannian geometry has an important tool to describe spacetime events.Therefore, solutions of some structures about 4-Walker manifold can be used to explain spacetime singularities.Then, here we present complex and paracomplex analogues of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanical systems on 4-Walker manifold.Finally, the geometrical-physical results related to complex (paracomplex) mechanical systems are also discussed.

## Introduction

As is well known, modern differential geometry plays an important role to explain the dynamics of Lagrangians.So, if Q is an m-dimensional configuration manifold and is a regular Lagrangian function, then it is well-known that there is a unique vector field X on TQ such that dynamics equation is given by
: L TQ  R = X L L i d  E (1)
where L  indicates the symplectic form.The triple (TQ, L  , X) is called a Lagrangian system on the tangent bundle TQ.Also, modern differential geometry provides a good framework in which develop the dynamics of Hamiltonians.Therefore, if Q is an m-dimensional configuration manifold and is a regular Hamiltonian energy function, then there is a unique vector field X on T * Q such that dynamics equation is given by
: H T Q   R = X i d  H (2)
where Φ indicates the symplectic form.The triple (T * Q, Φ, X) is called a Hamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle T * Q. Nowadays, there are many studies about Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics, mechanics, formalisms, systems and equations [1][2][3][4][5] and there in.There are real, complex, paracomplex and other analogues.As we know it is possible to produce different analogues in different spaces.Let 2n M be a Riemannian manifold with a neutral metric, i.e. with a semi-Riemannian metric g of signature (n, n).By a Walker n-manifold, we mean a semi-Riemannian manifold which admits a field of parallel null r-planes, with . 2 n r 

The canonical forms of the metrics were investigated by Walker [6].Special interest manifolds are Walker manifolds of even dimensions (n = 2m) admitting a field of null planes of maximum dimensionality(r = m).An application of such a 4-dimensional Walker metric is given in [7].Since the observation of the existence of almost complex structure on Walker 4-manifolds in [8], the Walker 4-manifolds and the almost Hermitian structures on the four-manifolds have been intensively studied, e.g., [9][10][11][12][13][14], etc.In this study, we present complex (paracomplex) analogues of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanical systems on 4-Walker manifold.In the end, some geometrical-physical results about the obtained complex (paracomplex) mechanical systems are also given.Throughout this paper, all mathematical objects and mappings are assumed to be smooth, i.e. infinitely differentiable and Einstein convention of summarizing is adopted.Denote by tions on M 4 , the set of vector fields on M 4 and the set of 1-forms on M 4 , respectively.


## Walker Manifold M 4


### Walker Metric

A neutral metric g on a 4-manifold M 4 is said to be Walker metric if there exists a 2-dimensional null distribution D on M 4 , which is parallel with respect to g.From Walker theorem [6], there is a system of coordinates with respect to which g takes the local canonical form

## Lagrangian Mechanical Systems

Now, our purpose is to obtain complex Euler-Lagrange equations for relativistic, quantum and classical mechanics on 4-dimensional Walker manifold M 4 .

Let M 4 be a Walker manifold and {x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 } be its coordinate functions.Let the semispray be the vector field X determined by

where
1 1 X x   , 2 2 X x   , 3 3 X x   , 4 4
X x   and the dot indicates the derivative with respect to time t.By means of the proper almost complex structure φ given by (4), the vector field is defined by

## Discussions

From above, complex and paracomplex Lagrangian mechanical systems have intrinsically been described on a Walker manifold M 4 : The paths of semispray X on Walker manifold M 4 are the solutions of complex and paracomplex Euler-Lagrange equations raised in (10) and (25).Also, complex and paracomplex Hamiltonian mechanical systems have intrinsically been described on a Walker manifold M 4 .The paths of Hamilton vector field X on the Walker manifold M 4 are the solutions of complex and paracomplex Hamiltonian equations raised in (21) and ( 27).

One easily see that the complex (paracomplex) Euler-Lagrange and Hamilton equations introduced in [4,5] are equivalent those in (10) and ( 21) (( 25) and ( 27)) if a = b = 0.

One can be proved that the here obtained equations are very important to explain the space-time mechanicalphysical problems.Therefore, the found equations are only considered to be a first step to realize how complex (paracomplex) structures on a Walker manifold has been used in solving problems in different physical areas.

For further research, the complex (paracomplex) Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanical equations derived here are suggested to deal with problems in electrical, magnetical and gravitational fields of relativistic, quantum and classical mechanics of physics.
