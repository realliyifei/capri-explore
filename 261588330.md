## INTRODUCTION

Resilience is resilience or the psychological quality that allows us to rise at least as strongly as before when life's hardships knock us down. They say that resilient people don't allow adversity to happen, traumatic events to happen, or not to run out of energy, and they are incredibly resilient and can change direction, heal emotions, and stay on target. I believe we can find a way to keep working towards it. It is a source of mental strength that people can draw upon when they need to endure without breaking. Psychologists believe that resilient people are better able to cope with adversity and rebuild their lives after hardships, in line with research (Student et al., 2021); ; (Ketprapakorn & Kantabutra, 2022) For someone, there comes a point when it becomes very difficult to get out of the problems that have arisen. It seems that even the whole world does not expect to recover from adversity. Resistance; but even if the whole world attacks, you must stand up and survive, there must be a way out. Resilience is defined as the result of the strength that exists within individuals so that they are able to adapt to difficult or unpleasant conditions that occur in life, resilience as the ability of individuals to be able to survive and adapt to a problem that occurs so that they are able to find the best solution to solve the problem and make themselves strong when facing obstacles and challenges in life, in line with research (Paul et al., 2020); (Jeannotte et al., 2021) Resilience is the ability possessed by individuals in responding to a situation positively so that when difficulties approach, it will be faced with Courage, and also resilience becomes an important basic trait for individuals to have in dealing with various pressures when living life. Describes seven components of resilience, these components are emotion regulation, impulse control, optimism, ability to analyze problems, empathy, self-efficacy, and achievement. Resilience is influenced by internal factors including cognitive ability, gender, and attachment to culture, as well as external factors from family and community. Someone who is resilient has the ability to control emotions, behavior and attention in dealing with problems. According to (Vaillant et al., 2023); (Redman, 2014) These not always comfortable situations make it difficult for people to cope with, learn from, or even change because of the situation. In psychology, resilience is understood as a positive human capacity to cope with stress and adversity. Resilience is the process of successfully adapting to difficult life experiences, in line with research (Susanto, Soehaditama, Febrian, et al., 2023), (Susanto, Parmenas, & Tannady, 2023), (Susanto, 2021).

The definition of competence is a combination of knowledge, skills, and personality attributes of a person so as to improve their performance and contribute to the success of their organization. In addition, competence also means the capacity that exists in a person and can make that person able to fulfill what is required by work in an organization so that the organization is able to achieve the expected results. In line with study (Susanto, Soehaditama, & Benned, 2023); (Gultom et al., 2022); ; (Hardiansyah et al., 2019).

According to (Ansori & Ali, 2015) A person's competencies are skills and characteristics what a person possesses in the form of knowledge, skills, and behavioral attitudes necessary to perform its duties in the environment his job. To know your level, you need your level of ability Expected performance in the "Good" or "Average" category. Determination of threshold Of course, the required competencies are used as the basis for the process Selection, successor, succession planning, performance evaluation, human resource development human power  .

According to research (Ismail et al., 2018) Involves capacity as an underlying human trait involving the effectiveness of an individual's performance or basic characteristics at work Individuals causal or causal to existing criteria used as a reference for effective or good or good performance at work, or in certain situations. Ability is a trait, according to some experts. It is the basis for a person to achieve peak performance at work. Inadequate employees slow down their work, wasting materials, time and energy. Meaning Competence is a deep and essential part of personality. A person who behaves predictably in a variety of work situations and tasks (Moeheriono, 2014 (Sedarmayanti, 2017).

Benefits of the HR Competency for various management purposes. In general, competencies are the professional abilities that each individual has to perform a task or work in a particular field according to their assigned position (Waris, 2015). Some experts say that the term competency is the skills, attitudes, knowledge, and values that a person possesses that can be identified by the way that person thinks or does something consistently. Each individual's ability plays a key role in efficiently performing various work tasks. Many large companies use competence as a basic criterion when hiring employees, in line with research (Setyadi & Sriekaningsih, 2015); (Rony et al., 2021).

According to (Aima et al., 2017) The benefits of competencies and their utilization in human capital management are immense. Today, the concept of competency is applied to many aspects of human resource management, mostly in the areas of training and development, recruitment and selection, and compensation systems. The concept of competencies has grown in popularity and is commonly used in large organizations to articulate work standards and expectations that should be met for a variety of reasons (Dijkstra et al., 2021).

An employee's job motivation is the psychological motivation that prompts someone to do something to achieve a particular goal. Everyone has different levels of motivation.

The presence of motivation in people is very important, especially for employees. The strength and will to do something, such as work, usually comes naturally when we feel the need. Human beings try as many things as they can to satisfy their desires. When your motivation is high, you keep trying and don't give up even if you fail. Motivation can also be a reason that arises from her two sources: herself and the environment, or internal and external factors. Of the two, the strongest motivation comes from yourself. Consistent with previous researchers (Siagian et al., 2023); ; (Susanto, Syailendra, & Suryawan, 2023); (Iwan et al., 2022); (Susanto, Sawitri, Ali, et al., 2023);(J. M. Putra et al., 2023) .

According to (Chairiyati, 2011) Spontaneity is very important in life including work. Strong impulses, especially those that come from oneself, cause people to: Be optimistic, It's not easy to give up or get lost, Resistant to obstacles and obstacles, Always think positive.

Performance management is an administrative control tool or process used by supervisors to monitor and evaluate employee performance. The purpose of this monitoring and evaluation process is to create a better working environment as an organization, group or individual. Performance management is the systematic process of improving organizational performance by improving the performance of individuals, teams, or groups. Therefore, effective and efficient performance of human resources (HR) in a company or organization is required, as organizational performance is the sum of individual and group performance. Performance management is a necessary system for companies. Improving employee performance, increasing employee motivation, evaluating employee and company performance, managing fair compensation, recommending employees for future careers, making promotion decisions, evaluating employee potential Through performance management, such as, companies can continuously improve their companies and organizations. You can continuously improve to reach your goals more easily and optimally, and the end result will be safer. in line with previous studies (Syahputra & Susanto, 2022); (Jumawan, 2023).

Performance management, also known as Performance management, has the general goal of guaranteeing that all business units can work together successfully to carry out their missions in order to meet their objectives. Performance management and human resource management are also important in order for: With the use of incentives and reward systems, employees can increase their motivation. In order for a employee to carry out their work in an efficient and legal manner, it is necessary to make it easier for them to recognize the resources and tools they need. Can recognize any employee misconduct and indicate it by the presence of controlling and development. Establishing a vertical communication system, or communication between managers and employees, will allow for more transparent and constructive interactions, which will increase employee productivity. in line with previous research (Lesmini et al., 2023); (R. Putra et al., 2021);;


## METHODS

Used in this study Methods, studies, literature review, qualitative research, location of study. This emphasizes the depth of the result. Previous studies in which the researcher was directly involved as a research tool. Qualitative method is one of them. By conducting research according to the situation, humans as tools and adapted humans in normal circumstances in relation to When data collection is enabled generally qualitative.


## RESULT AND DISCUSSION

Changes in work styles and working environments also affect employees' expectations of the company. The changing working environment naturally requires special strategies for performance evaluation in management. By implementing performance management, companies can provide their employees with a better experience in terms of development and organization. For example, companies can find skills and developments to improve the skills of their employees. Additionally, performance management can be used to build a competitive and agile organization. Performance management is more than just a tool for creating and measuring employee goals and outcomes. His presence in the organization does not end there. The reason is that performance management helps managers and employees have a clear understanding of expectations, goals and career development. These weigh on employees' personal performance expectations and company goals, in line with research ; .

There is no denying that some employees are willing to take on any task to improve their performance while impressing their managers. Additionally, leaders don't know how to give employees constructive feedback on their performance. By implementing performance management, the company is helping its assets focus on building a healthier working environment. Of course, you can also improve performance according to your company's goals. A successful performance management strategy is sustainable and provides managers with many opportunities to correct and reward team members. It also provides team members with many opportunities to improve their work. Effective performance management impacts all day-to-day operations and processes, enabling teams to thrive in the short and long term. Performance measures, on the other hand, are data points that teams can use to assess their progress. These include key metrics on sales, quotas, or daily activity metrics. Overall, performance management is the process of evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of these measurement goals, in line with research ; (Muhammad & Tahir, 2023) Employees are important capital of a company. No company can achieve its desired goals without the cooperation of its employees. Therefore, many companies want their employees to perform at their best, or to be their best performers. However, employee performance can fluctuate. This poses a challenge for HR departments when managing employee performance. One way to manage employee performance is through the use of a performance management system. A performance management system, or performance management system, is one of the human resource management (HR) systems for setting, monitoring, evaluating, and tracking company goals. Performance is the performance delivered by an employee or company over a period of time. An individual's performance is understood to be the performance that an individual has achieved over a period of time (usually her year). Purpose of Performance Management System, Generally, performance management systems are created with the goal of monitoring and controlling the performance of employees in an enterprise. However, a closer look reveals that performance management systems serve several purposes: Give your employees targeted and effective feedback. This will serve as a reference for setting salary increases and allowances. Improve two-way communication between management and employees. Improve employee performance through employee empowerment and reward mechanisms. Therefore, we have introduced a performance management system to evaluate employee performance and improve future performance, in line with research ; (Pahrudin et al., 2018); (Nikkhoo et al., 2018).

The best performance management system seems simple as long as you follow mutually agreed procedures. However, integrating with a basic enterprise operating system can be more difficult than it sounds. Through formal and informal processes, these systems help align people, resources, and policies to achieve the organization's strategic goals. Ideally, every company has work processes that can be measured and improved over time. Especially when it comes to performance management, it is closely related to business development goals and organizational culture. Organizational cultures are evolving into continuous feedback cultures fueled by technology. Managers can anticipate problems based on their employees' current performance and initiate all sorts of fixes to keep them on track, in line with research (Student et al., 2021); (Van Iddekinge et al., 2018); (Chan et al., 2017). A performance management system is an innovative system for managing and improving the performance of individuals or teams within an organization. This typically involves a structured process of setting performance goals, measuring performance against those goals, and providing feedback and appropriate interventions to improve future performance. It may also include formal performance reviews, career development and performance-related compensation systems. Its primary purpose is to ensure that individuals or teams within an organization can focus on strategic goals and meet prescribed performance standards. (Pekkala & van Zoonen, 2022) The reason companies need performance management systems is that they can set goals and strategies to achieve business goals. Then measure how well your employees are meeting those goals. By using this system, companies can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their employees. In addition, you can improve the quality of the products and services you offer your customers. In addition, it helps companies identify training and development needs for their employees. The primary goal of any performance management system is to improve employee performance and overall organizational success. This allows companies to set the necessary goals and strategic steps. In addition, employee achievement of goals is also measured. Therefore, it helps companies to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their employees. In addition, performance management systems also help organizations manage and improve performance across their workforce. In addition, it helps companies to improve the quality of the products and services they offer to their customers and improve customer satisfaction, in line with research, in line with research (Green et al., 2017) (Hollywood et al., 2016); (Brown et al., 2019).


## CONCLUSION

The purpose of this study is to find literature in order to explain the variety in the given article's research, and the results are provided to be used as a stepping stone in future research or as a gap in existing research. Recommendations from the study can be used to clear the area, particularly in the area of Human Resource related to the variable described in the article. It is necessary to continue after this article with the same variable or another variable and the objects that will be used.

Formal performance management programs help managers and employees see eye-to-eye on career expectations, goals and progress, including how an individual's work aligns with the company's overall vision. In general, performance management views individuals in the context of the broader workplace system. In theory, it seeks absolute performance standards, even though those are considered unattainable. Performance management programs use traditional tools such as creating and measuring goals, objectives, and achievements. They also aim to determine what effective performance looks like and develop processes for measuring performance. However, instead of using the traditional paradigm of year-end reviews, performance management turns every interaction with employees into an opportunity to learn.

Managers can use performance management tools to adjust workflows, recommend new actions, and make other decisions that will help employees achieve their goals. In turn, this helps the company achieve its goals and perform optimally. For example, the manager of the sales department gives staff a revenue volume target that they must achieve within a certain period of time. In the performance management system, along with the numbers, managers will offer quantified guidance to help salespeople succeed. Focusing on ongoing accountability creates a healthier, more transparent work environment, and the emphasis on regular meetings can improve overall communication. Because performance management sets concrete rules, everyone has a clearer understanding of expectations. When expectations are clear, the workplace is less stressful. Employees aren't trying to impress managers by performing some random task, and managers aren't worrying about how to let employees know they're not performing well. If the system is working, they probably already know it.

Performance management is used in the workplace and applied to achieve desired outcomes by managers through the interaction of people in the environment. It is a strategic and integrated approach to increasing the efficiency of the company by improving the performance of its employees and developing the skills of its teams and individual contributors. Through the process, you can align the personal goals of all employees with the corporate goals and improve the productivity and profitability of your organization. This can be implemented not only by individuals, but also by individual organizations, departments within an organization, or areas.
