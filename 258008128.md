Quick Response Code:Dry eye disease (DED) is an emerging global health concern with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) being the most common subtype of DED. Despite being quite prevalent, the pathophysiological mechanisms governing MGD are poorly understood. Animal models for MGD can be a valuable resource to advance our understanding of this entity and explore novel diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Although a lot of literature on rodent MGD models exists, a comprehensive review on rabbit animal models is lacking. Rabbits offer a great advantage over other animals as models for studying both DED and MGD. Rabbits have a widely exposed ocular surface and meibomian gland anatomy comparable with humans, which makes performing dry eye diagnostic tests possible using clinically validated imaging platforms. The existing MGD models in rabbits can broadly be classified as pharmacologically induced and surgically induced models. Most models show keratinization of the meibomian gland orifice with plugging as the final common pathway for developing MGD. Thus, understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each rabbit MGD model can help researchers choose the appropriate experimental plan based on the objective of the study. In this review, we discuss the comparative anatomy of the meibomian glands in humans and rabbits, various rabbit models of MGD, translational applications, unmet needs, and future directions in developing MGD models in rabbits.

Dry Eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial condition characterized by altered tear film homeostasis leading to ocular surface dysfunction and damage. [1,2] It is an emerging health burden with an estimated global prevalence ranging from 5 to 50%, also being reported in the younger population. [2][3][4][5] Furthermore, these numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg as they do not include the asymptomatic and subclinical forms of the disease, which are difficult to diagnose. [6][7][8] DED can be classified as aqueous-deficient dry eye, evaporative dry eye (EDE), and mixed variant based on tear film insufficiency, faster evaporation, or a combination of both. [1,9] EDE has been reported to be the most common variant of DED globally, with a majority of it caused by meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). [4,10] MGD is a persistent, diffuse abnormality of the meibomian gland characterized by altered secretion of the lipid layer of the tear film leading to EDE. [11,12] It can be broadly classified as hypersecretory (meibomian seborrhea) and hyposecretory (meibomian sicca) variants characterized by increased and reduced secretions of the lipid layer of tear film, respectively. [9,12] Hyposecretory MGD is more common, which leads to hyperkeratinization and obstruction of the meibomian gland orifices. [9,11,13] MGD has been gaining much importance in recent years, given its increased incidence with the rampant rise in video display terminal use and its impact on quality of life and work productivity. [9,11] Tear film ocular surface society Dry eye workshop (TFOS-DEWS) II report has indicated MGD to be the most common subtype of DED which remains poorly understood. [1,14] This emphasizes the pressing need for extensive research in this area which can be effectively carried out using animal models.

Animal models of MGD have been used for decades to study the pathophysiological mechanisms and benefits of therapeutic interventions of DED. [15][16][17] Various canine, feline, murine, and other animal models have been used to study the factors governing MGD. [17][18][19][20][21] However, there is no single animal model yet that can recapitulate the entirety of MGD This is an open access journal, and articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.

But they can effectively capture specific targets of the disease process enabling us to study one or more aspects like morphology, pathophysiology, biochemistry, genomics, or outcomes of novel therapies. [19,22] Thus, it is crucial to understand the pros and cons of various animal models for MGD to choose them appropriately based on the attribute being studied. Numerous reports have been published on animal models for MGD, mostly using murine models. [17,19,23] But there is a paucity of literature on such models in rabbits and a comprehensive review of rabbit MGD models is lacking. Additionally, there is not much research on rabbit meibography with newer diagnostic platforms that would allow us to objectively compare structural and functional alterations with humans. Thus, this review attempts to discuss various rabbit models of MGD, highlighting rabbit-human meibomian gland comparative anatomy, approaches used to generate these models, insights obtained on pathophysiological mechanisms, potential translational applications, and future perspectives.


## Methods

A thorough literature search was conducted pertaining to the animal models of MGD on the key electronic bibliographic database PUBMED (PubMed.gov) from the year 1980 to 2022. The keywords used for the search were "animal model for dry eye," "animal model and meibomian gland dysfunction," "rabbit and dry eye," and "rabbit and meibomian gland dysfunction." We short listed the articles in English language that had relevance to rabbit animal models in MGD. Additionally, data on meibography, noninvasive tear film metrics, and histology of normal and intraductal electrocauterization of meibomian glands in New Zealand white rabbit (n=1) have been included under surgically induced intraductal electrocauterization models. The respective institutional review boards of the institute and animal lab facility have approved the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki, and animal handling was done in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Anesthesia was administered as described in 'Tulane university Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)' guidelines for rabbit.


## Comparison of Anatomy in Human and Rabbit Meibomian Glands

Meibomian glands were discovered and described as a part of ocular adnexa for the first time in 1666 by Meibom. [24] Meibomian glands in humans are structurally similar to rabbits and nonhuman primates and are embedded into the tarsal plates of both eyelids. [18,20] Histology of eyelids in rabbits is similar to humans and consists of skin, orbicularis, tarsus, and conjunctiva anteroposteriorly. [25] However, in contrast to humans, the upper eyelid in rabbits is shorter and thicker than the lower lid, with the latter positioned more advanced onto the cornea than the upper lid at rest. [25,26] Rabbits have a third eyelid called palpebra tertia (plica semilunaris), which has been reported to harbor glands that are predominantly serous and unlike meibomian glands which are sebaceous glands. [25] Meibomian glands in rabbits are higher in number but shorter than in humans. Rabbits have 40-50 meibomian glands in both eyelids, while humans have 20-40 glands in the upper lid and 20-30 in the lower lid. [25,26] Structurally, meibomian gland units are simple branched acinar structures with a central ductule system in both rabbits and humans. The basal-stratified squamous epithelial cell layer of the acini proliferates, with cells also known as sebocytes maturing as they move centripetally toward the ductule. Once these mature sebocytes approach the ductules, they undergo apoptosis to release the lipid-rich secretion called meibum into their lumen (holocrine secretion). [9] Meibum then gets released onto the ocular surface with blink action through the central ductule that opens at the posterior part of the lid margin. Rabbits also differ from humans in terms of lid margin keratinization. While keratinization is known to stop at the transition zone in humans, it extends beyond the posterior lid margin to involve the lid wiper zone in rabbits. [ Fig. 1]. Atsumi et al. reported that the meibomian glands and central ducts were underdeveloped at 6 and 13 weeks of age, which developed by 20 weeks in both male and female rabbits. [27] Thus, it is preferable to include rabbits above 20 weeks of age in studies involving meibomian glands. Wickham et al. reported no significant difference in the expression of androgen, estrogen, and progesterone mRNA receptors in meibomian glands of male and female rabbits. [28] However, no clear literature exists on histological differences between male and female meibomian glands anatomy.

The total meibomian gland volume in humans is twice and 1.5 times higher than in rabbits in upper and lower lids, respectively. The ratio of total gland volume to exposed ocular surface is about 1.7 times more in humans than in rabbits. [29] However, studies using interface patterns of specular reflection show that the lipid layer thickness of tear film in rabbits is higher than in humans. [29,30] This could be due to additional sources of lipid secretions like adnexal tissues in rabbits, while meibomian glands remain the only source of tear film lipids in humans. [29] The composition of meibum in rabbits has also been reported to be slightly different from humans. [23] Rabbits have a larger quantity of diacylated-diols and 24,25 dihydro-lanosterol containing esters and a lower abundance of wax esters, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters compared to humans. [23,31,32] However, the amphiphilic (polar ) lipids considered critical in the distribution of lipid layer over the ocular surface have been found in rabbit which are similar in length with a higher degree of saturation compared to humans. [23] Physiologically, rabbits blink less frequently compared to humans with an interblink interval of about 20 min. [33] However, mice and rats have also been reported to have infrequent blink. [34,35] The tear film break-up time has also been reported to be longer in rabbits, probably due to the greater lipid layer thickness of >180 nm as compared to 60-180 nm in humans. [36] So, while rabbits offer tremendous advantages for experimental eye models involving ocular examination techniques, imaging, and surgical interventions, they may not be ideal for studying lipidome or meibum-based studies. [23,37] 


## Animal-Based Models of MGD

Animal models can offer vital information to advance medicine and enhance our understanding of human illnesses. The complexity of DED itself and the demands for modern-day pharmacotherapy or interventions have escalated the need for more refined animal models. [20,[38][39][40] However, given the multifactorial etiology and heterogeneity of DED, it is not easy to come up with a single ideal model satisfying all the requirements. An appropriate animal model for investigating MGD must include some, ideally all, of the clinical characteristics of the human disease, including gland blockage, keratinization of the ducts, ductule enlargement, atrophy of the glands, and eventual gland drop-out. [14,18,41] Generation of MGD in an animal model should diffusely involve the entire eyelid in a chronic and progressive manner mimicking the disease in humans. Animal models might be used to research spontaneous MGD, like what is seen in humans, or experimental MGD models can be generated to induce the disease, depending on the goals of the study.


## Various model organisms used for generating MGD models

Numerous model organisms belonging to various taxonomies like canines, murine, rabbits, and nonhuman primates have been used to generate animal models of MGD. [19,23] These models differ from each other in various aspects and offer specific advantages and disadvantages. [15,23] Canines were frequently used in the past for generating an animal model of MGD. [42] They live longer and are prone to MGD with gland dropouts being strikingly similar to humans. [22,43] While dogs are a great model to investigate MGD, experimental research involving them is highly contentious, costly, and requires specific facilities and ethical approvals. [44,45] These shortcomings also apply to the use of nonhuman primates like apes. Animals like mice, rats, and rabbits seem to be preferred alternatives to overcome most of these challenges. They have been successfully used to generate several animal models of MGD like rabbit epinephrine-induced MGD, [46,47] primate polychlorinated biphenyl-induced MGD, [46] and the rhino mouse genetic MGD models. [48] Rodents (mice and rats) have been extensively used to generate knockout and transgenic animal models that allow researchers to study the role of specific pathways in the pathophysiology of MGD. [18,19,39] They are easy to handle and are preferable in carrying out lipidome-based studies. [35] However, narrow ocular surface exposure, challenges in imaging, and inability to conduct long-term studies are their major shortcomings. Compared to rodents, the rabbit model appears to be more acceptable for evaluating experimentally induced DED, as their eyes have a wider corneal and conjunctival surface that provides greater accessibility for ocular surface evaluation and most dry eye diagnostic tests can be performed with ease. [38,[49][50][51][52] The important factors to be considered while choosing a model organism are the size of the eyeball, cost, biochemical profile, and the availability of species-specific reagents. The advantages and disadvantages of various model organisms for generating MGD models are discussed in detail in Table 1.


## Rabbit models for meibomian gland dysfunction

Most of the animal models of MGD available are murine models which are predominantly genetically modified models. [17,21] The ease with which transgenic variants can be developed in rodents has resulted in an extensive use of these MGD models. [21,39,51] Generating such models in rabbits is challenging as one-third of the rabbit genome is not yet annotated. This explains the lack of transgenic rabbit animal models in literature. However, as demonstrated in Table 1, rabbits have considerable benefits over rodents in terms of ease of performing clinical and diagnostic dry eye tests that are used in humans, though the interpretation needs to be validated. [49] Thus, over the past few decades, various alternate mechanisms have been used for generating rabbit models for MGD. [Fig. 2] These can be broadly classified as pharmacologically induced and surgically generated models, as discussed below. [ Table 2] 1. Pharmacologically induced models


## Topical epinephrine MGD model

Pharmacologically induced models are the first rabbit MGD models reported in literature. In 1982, Jester et al., generated the first-ever rabbit MGD model using epinephrine hydrochloride drops. [46] In this study, they treated five rabbits each with 0.5% and 2% epinephrine hydrochloride. Rabbits treated with either no drops or 0.5% epinephrine did not have any meibomian gland alterations clinically or histopathologically. However, those treated with 2% epinephrine gradually acquired minor conjunctival erythema with engorgement or dilatation of meibomian glands with eventual keratinization of the orifice. The glands over the lower tarsal plate close to the inferior punctum were more extensively involved likely due to increased contact time with the accumulated drug in the lacrimal lake. [47] This study, for the first time, demonstrated the use of a modified biomicroscopic and photographic method to record the evolving anatomic changes in rabbit meibomian glands in real time and their effectiveness in detecting the subclinical alterations. [44] The same group, later in 1989, repeated the same experiment in 34 albino rabbits with periodic evaluation for 6 months and showed that increased keratinization and stratification of the meibomian gland duct epithelium correlated with the development and progression of MGD. [47] The increase in keratinization over the orifices was confirmed using keratin-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies. The meibomian gland secretions in these rabbits exhibited a significant increase in both 65-67 kD and 56.5 kD keratinization proteins, which have  [15,50] DED=Dry eye disease, OS=ocular surface, EC=ethical committee, TF=Tear film also been reported to be specific to keratinized epidermis in humans. [47,53] 


## Freund's Adjuvant induced model

In 2017, Miyake et al. used Japanese white rabbits to create an MGD model with meibomitis by injecting heat-inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis dissolved in full Freud's adjuvant into the margins of the upper eyelid. [54] The nasal, central, and temporal areas of the eyelids received one injection each which induced chronic inflammation that resulted in the development of MGD and subsequent EDE. Macroscopic and histopathologic examinations revealed inflammatory infiltration, cystic duct dilatation, and granulation tissue formation in the meibomian glands. Slit-lamp examination of rabbits with clogged orifices revealed palpebral conjunctiva hyperemia, telangiectasia around the orifices, and toothpaste like meibum on expression. This was described as a model depicting the pathophysiology of meibomitis with significant inflammation as opposed to the routine gland dropout models. However, as the rabbits were followed up only until 11 days in this study, inflammation induced by the procedure itself would persist and chronic changes resulting from obstruction of MG orifices like duct dilatation and acinar atrophy would not set in that early. [54] While this study reflects short-term changes only, it gives an opportunity to study the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents in the acute stage.


## Systemic 13-cis retinoic acid-induced model

Lambert et al. had developed a rabbit MGD model using systemic administration of 13-cis retinoic acid. They administered Isotretinoin at a dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight and followed up with these rabbits for 12 weeks. [55] All treated rabbits showed a decrease in the number and size of acini with the thickening of the epithelial lining of the ducts and ductules. In rabbits treated with a higher dose of isotretinoin, peri-acinar fibroblastic tissue replaced the acini. These rabbits also developed systemic toxicity simulating hypervitaminosis A with features like dry skin and alopecia. This study showed that isotretinoin has an inhibitory effect on meibomian acinar differentiation while stimulating the proliferation of duct epithelium. Isotretinoin also has been reported to have an additional lipolytic effect, thereby destabilizing the tear film. [56] Histopathological changes observed in this rabbit MGD model were similar to that seen in human skin sebaceous glands following isotretinoin administration. [56,57] Ibrahim et al. had reported amelioration of isotretinoin-induced MGD in albino rats by using dehydroepiandrosterone due to its androgenic effect. [58] Thus, newer drugs with androgenic activity can be tested in these animal models to study their potential therapeutic effect in MGD.


## Surgically induced models 2.1 Intraductal electrocauterization model

In 1989, Gilbard et al. generated the first surgically induced Pathophysiology of S. aureus cell wall-induced blepharitis was not investigated. Lambert RW, et al., 1988. [55] NZ white rabbits Systemic administration of Isotretinoin (12 weeks) Decrease in the number and size of acini with thickening of the epithelial lining of the ducts and ductules.

Structural alterations in MG were not observed but some changes in lipid profile were observed.

Morphological changes in the MG, LLT or ocular surface changes were not observed.

Eom Y, et al., 2017. [59] NZ white rabbits Partial electrosurgical coagulation of MG orifices. (2 weeks)

Suitable for MGD-associated DED research.

Coagulation of the MG orifices was partial which contributed to continuing meibomian gland function. Miyake H, et al., 2017. [54] Japanese white rabbits SC injection of Freund's adjuvant containing heat-killed M. tuberculosis into the eyelid margin. (4 weeks) Inflammation was built by injecting the emulsion followed by MGD.

No acinar atrophy was observed in rabbit's MG. Follow-up duration was short NZ white rabbits=New Zealand white rabbits, MG=meibomian gland, MGD=meibomian gland disease, ID=intradermal, S. Aureus=Staphylococcus aureus, TOV=tear osmolarity value, LLT=lipid layer thickness, DED=dry eye disease, SC=subcutaneous, M. tuberculosis=mycobacterium tuberculosis model of MGD. They cauterized the meibomian gland orifices of New Zealand white rabbits using Accu-temp disposable cautery and followed them up for 20 weeks. [12] This study reported an increase in tear film osmolarity as the meibomian gland orifice closure increased, in the presence of average lacrimal gland production. Additionally, a decrease in corneal glycogen and goblet cell density was observed. [12] A similar study was done in 2017 by Eom et al., where a 5-MHz high-frequency electrosurgical device was used to coagulate the meibomian gland orifices of the middle two-thirds of the lid margin of upper and lower eyelids in rabbits. [59] This study concluded that closure of the meibomian gland opening lead to enlargement of the ducts with shrinkage resulting in tear film instability. However, they could not demonstrate morphological changes on meibography during the study duration of 8 weeks. Also, viable one-third of meibomian glands would continue to release meibum onto the ocular surface, stabilizing the tear film.

The authors report their experience with this technique where electrocauterization of the meibomian gland orifices over the entire eyelid of New Zealand white rabbits was done. Briefly, the rabbit was anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine (35 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). This was followed by 5-MHz high-frequency electrocauterization of all the meibomian gland orifices of left upper and lower eye lids using Elman mono-polar cautery (KENTAMED RF 100, Bulgaria). [ Fig. 3] The other eye was taken as control and the rabbits were followed up for a duration of 12 weeks. Meibomian gland imaging and noninvasive tear film metrics were captured using keratograph 5M (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany) as depicted in Fig. 4 followed by histological studies. The meibography captured enlargement of the meibomian glands with the development of dropout areas in the due course. Fig. 5 demonstrates changes on meibography following electrocautery in rabbits showing the development of gland dropout areas similar to that seen in humans with MGD. The histological examination of the meibomian glands revealed marked dilatation of the central ducts, dilatation, and shortening of the ductules with a reduction in the size of secretory acini. [ Fig. 6] Also, the gland dropout areas did not demonstrate any residual framework or acini of the meibomian gland. This is similar to the observation reported in human eyelids, where gland dropout was devoid of any glandular tissue on histopathology. [60] 2.2 Androgen deficiency models Sullivan et al. had studied the impact of androgen deficiency on the meibomian glands in rabbits by performing orchiectomy. [61] This study established meibomian glands as a target organ for androgens in rabbits. It also revealed that androgen deficiency had an impact on lipid profile and possibly on proteins of the meibomian gland. However, this model did not show any morphological changes in the MG, lipid layer thickness, or ocular surface changes. This could be due to the premature results given the shorter duration (14 days) of the study and the additional contribution of lipids from adnexal sources in rabbits. Thus, this study showed that meibomian glands are androgen target organs with androgens influencing the lipid profile of meibum within the tissue. But the extent of this androgen influence on meibomian gland secretions needs to be studied further.


## Translational Research Using Rabbit MGD Models

Rabbit MGD models offer a huge scope for translational research and have contributed significantly to our current understanding of   [54] Li et al. had developed a novel tear lipid strip test using rabbit animal models wherein they used lipophilic and hydrophilic lipid strips to extract lipids from tear film. [62] This novel method can be extremely useful in qualitative and quantitative measurement of tear film lipids. Studies using androgen deficiency models have also shown that supplementation of 19-nortestosterone had countered the effects of castration in rabbits restoring the tear lipid pattern close to normal male rabbits. [61] This opens up avenues to explore the impact of androgenic drugs in improving the tear lipid layer in humans with MGD. Novel therapeutic interventions like the use of low-level radiofrequency thermal treatment have shown promising results in reversing obstructive MGD in electrocauterized meibomian glands of rabbits. [63] 


## Unmet Needs and Future Directions

Although MGD is the most common sub-type of DED impacting the quality of life of millions, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms governing it remain elusive. It is vital to understand the exact pathogenesis and natural history of the disease and to test novel diagnostic and therapeutic modalities to provide better care to our patients. The complexity of DED itself and the demands of modern-day pharmacotherapy and interventions have escalated the need for more refined animal models. The major drawback of existing animal models of MGD is that most of them are short-term models. As MGD is a chronic progressive disease, having long-term models can improve our understanding of the evolution of the disease and detect windows of opportunity to halt or slow down its progression with targeted therapies. Many of the dry eye tests used in animal studies are not standardized for correlation with humans. [62] Thus, standardizing or modifying these tests for different species can improve their predictability especially with the use of noninvasive tear film imaging devices and optimize these models for correlation with humans. Extensive research focusing on biomarkers for early detection of disease and the impact of hormonal therapy, various systemic medications, and environmental stress on meibomian glands can be beneficial. [50] Hence, future research focussing on long-term MGD rabbit models can enhance our understanding of the natural history of the disease and facilitate the use of newer noninvasive diagnostic platforms for the objective assessment of DED and draw parallels with humans. [64] Also, developing models with varied severity of MGD can help test the efficacy of numerous novel diagnostic and therapeutic modalities across the entire disease spectrum.


## Conclusion

The review throws light on the correlation of rabbit-human anatomy, existing rabbit MGD models and offers an update on current understanding, unmet needs, and future perspectives of rabbit models of MGD. Although common lab animals, such as rabbits, rats, and mice, have all been used to study aspects of MGD, no single model can completely recapitulate all aspects of clinical disease. Rabbit models are very conducive for experimental studies involving ocular surface examination, invasive and noninvasive dry eye testing, and surgical interventions. However, they may not be as preferable for conducting lipidome-based studies. Pharmacologically induced models using epinephrine and intraductal electrocauterization-induced rabbit MGD models seem to be most feasible and reliable based on the outcomes reported. As pathophysiological mechanisms for MGD are poorly understood, developing a long-term rabbit MGD model with serial follow-up can enhance our understanding of the natural course of this disease. Once such models are developed, they can aid in identifying biomarkers for early detection of disease, test novel drugs, and treatment strategies resulting in a huge translational impact catering to millions of patients suffering from MGD.
