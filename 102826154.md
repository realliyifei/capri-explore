The review article is focused on studies of Isatin-based Schciff Bases and their biological and pharmacological activities.Isatin-based Schiff base are generally synthesized by condensation of the keto group of Isatin with different aromatic primary amines carrying imine or azomethine (-C=N-) functional group.Isatin Schciff Base possesses numerous biological properties like antitumor, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antiviral, anti HIV, antioxidant, CNS depressant activities.

## INTRODUCTION

Isatin or 1H-indole-2, 3-dione (1) is an indole derivative.The compound was first obtained by Erdman and Laurent in 1841 (Otto Linne Erdmann, 1840).Isatin is an important class of heterocyclic compounds.Recently, heterocyclic compounds analogues and their derivatives have attracted strong interest in medicinal chemistry due to their biological and pharmacological properties.(Manju P et. al., 2011).The small and simple isatin nucleus possesses numerous biological properties like antimicrobial (Singh UK et. al., 2010), anti HIV (Pandeya SN et. al., 1999), antitubercular (Ozlen G et. al., 2008), antitumor (Hoyun L et. al., 2009), antiinflammatory (Gummadi SB et. al., 2010), antioxidant (Prakash CR et. al., 2011), antiviral (Shibinskya MO et. al., 2010), anticonvulsant (Prince PS et. al., 2009) and CNS depressant activities (Zapata- Sudo G et. al., 1986).

In nature, isatin is found in plants of the genus Isatis 12 , in Calanthe discolor (Yoshikawa M et. al., 1998), in Couroupita guianensis Aubl (Bergman J et. al., 1985), has also been found as a component of the secretion from the parotid gland of Bufo frogs (Wei L et. al., 1982) and in humans as it is a metabolic derivative of adrenaline (Ischia M et. al., 1988), ( Palumbo A et. al., 1989).Substituted isatins are also found in plants, for example the melosatin alkaloids (methox phenylpentyl isatins) obtained from the Caribbean tumorigenic plant Melochia tomentosa (Kapadia GJ et. al., 1980), ( Kapadia GJ et. al., 1977) as well as from fungi: 6-(3'-methylbuten-2'yl)isatin was isolated from Streptomyces albus (Grafe U and Radics L, 1986) and 5-(3'-methylbuten-2'yl)isatin from Chaetomium globosum (Breinholt J et. al., 1996).Isatin is one of the most promising new classes of heterocyclic molecules having many interesting activity profiles and well-tolerated in human (Yan Y et. al., 1992), (Joaquim FM et. al., 2001)


## Synthesis of Isatin
