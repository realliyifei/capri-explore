## Introduction

Men are no longer living in an age where their un dies have to be ugly and practical. It has become a billion dollar industry which has added focus to fashion, comfort, and gender appeal. Even though the underwear is hidden most of the time that does not negate the role of an undergarment [1]. Men, in general, avoid exploring the possibilities and are in a habit of sticking to the usual style of underneath article. However, over the past few years, the intimate apparel industry has definitely seen a lot of progress. The classic debate over 'boxer versus brief' has now shifted to the usability of the erotically attractive styles of men's underwear. These days the customers are open to discussing the skivvies like lace underwear and pouch underwear for men which were earlier considered a taboo and stigma. The underwear industry for men is now flooded with choices that range from the classic styles of boxer briefs and boxer shorts to the radically aesthetic men's thongs, G-strings, and even C-string. It won't be wrong to state that this is one category of men's apparel, which initially held the reputation of clothing that just covers the genital, has come a long way to being an essential staple for defining the overall style quotient [2].

Comfort, style, and color are the three attributes which need to be considered for men's underwear. Comfort is a fundamental necessity. The comfort of the underwear is related to three things; the size, climate, and fabric used. Underwear that adapts to body's temperature whatever the climate provides a better comfort by keeping warm in winter, cool and dry in summer [1][2][3]. Generally, underwear is measured with designations of S, M, L, and XL (Table  1) below shows the general waistline measurements in inches according to the size.


## History of Men's Underwear

According to the historians, the oldest example of men's underwear, the leather loincloth, dates back to the cave man in early 3000 BC [4]. The loincloth is the simplest form of underwear that is draped around the hips and groin. This was the first time when men were observed wearing anything other than a fig leave to cover up their privates. This remained in the trend for several years. The only change was in terms of fabric used in making of this apparel. The variation on the loincloth seems to have persisted when loosefitting trousers called the braises came into fashion. The trousers tied at the waist and thighs were a vogue into the middle ages [5]. These were later upgraded into codpieces in the 16th century. These underneath apparel were a fashion statement and usually came in bright colours and with padded contraptions [6].

The fitted knee-length apparel that men wore beneath their pants was not very comfy. This led to the invention of the elastic waistband in the year 1925 and this led to the development of boxer shorts. Thus, the underwear for men become much more resilient and supportive [7]. 'Look good... Feel good... Be twice the man in Y-front', was the quote that described the very first men's brief ( Figure 1). This came in as a pleasant surprise for the male population who needed something lot more supportive down there [8]. However, it is lesser known fact that boxer shorts were not the very first invention in men's underwear industry. Jockstraps were invented way before in the late 1800s. This skivvy style was specifically invented to provide comfort and support to the cyclists [9]. Pioneered by the designer, John Varvatos, boxer briefs were introduced in the year 1990. Combining the length of the boxers and the snug fit of brief, this underneath article took the entire industry by storm. The aesthetically revolutionary underneath article is till date the most used style [10]. 


## Men's Underwear Styles

Long gone are the days when the choice of men's underwear was simple and limited. Despite the fact, the underwear is a lesser talked about subject in menswear; the options available in this category these days are ample. It makes more sense to wear a different style when travelling, working out at the gym or when wearing trim denim or trousers instead of wearing the same style for all day every day. The different aspects of the various styles of men's underwear are given in (Figure 2). 


## Men's Boxers

The boxer shorts were initially introduced in 1925 and were known as 'shorts for boxers' [4]. This was the first time when elastic waistbands were used in the undies. Even though it took some time to gain popularity, the underwear style is true to its namesake. Inspired by the actual boxers, the skivvy extends a few inches above the knees covering almost one-third of the thighs and has a contoured pouch for comfort. However, they lacked the support that the union suits offered. The problem of bunching and riding up highlighted the need of undergarment that fitted the body snugly. However, the baggy style kept everything airy and comfy.

The increased support and alluring appeal have occupied a section of the top drawer of every man since then. In the 1980s, the conventional un dies were upgraded to fashion briefs.

What makes it versatile is the fact that it can be easily dyed in vivid colors. This has made the introduction of some jazzy and lesser used shades possible in the intimate category for men. The fabric has moderate strength but is soft to the skin and abrasion resistant. Thus, it is practical option to reduce sticking and squashing of the manhood during the day. The shrink resistant material makes the underneath article durable, and sustain multiple washes. Rayon underwear materials to be washed by hand and should not be clubbed with other clothes in the washing machine [20].


## Best wearing condition

The lightweight fabric is an apt option to beat the heat of summer. The thin material provides top-notch ventilation and keeps everything breezy down there. The material stretches easily, so, it is not a recommended option for all day use. Moreover, it won't provide the much-needed warmth during winter.


## Polyester underwear

Polyester includes naturally occurring chemicals. It is often blended with natural fibers such as cotton that helps bind the fibers together.


## Properties

Polyester provides a smooth and synthetic feel. The skivvies made of this material feel very soft against the skin of the wearer. The fabric is resistant to wrinkle, mildew as well as abrasion. This is why it is used in making men's swimwear. The fabric keeps the package isolated and away from the body even when drenched. Polyester is extremely strong and does not stretch or shrink. Thus, these undergarments last longer than usual undies. Moreover, it can be machine washed and dried [21].


## Best wearing condition

As mentioned above, it is an apt option for the bikini season. The swimsuit crafted in polyester will facilitate all sorts of water adventures. The material has high absorbency; hence, it is not a recommended option for the hot season.


## Silk underwear

The smooth and soft texture of silk provides luxurious feel down there. A filament fiber formed from the protein secreted by silkworms is known for its shiny look, softness as well as insulating power.


## Properties

The silky feels and sleek style of the fabric make it a perfect material for making the novelty underwear. The extremely soft texture keeps the wearer comfortable. Insulation is a unique property of silk. It is very absorbent and not a good conductor of heat. It traps the heat and prevents it from leaving the clothing. Thus, it creates an insulating layer in between the cloth and the body of the wearer. Silk is durable and has the greatest pull strength as compared to all the natural fibers [22].


## Best wearing condition

As silk is a bad conductor of heat, thus, it is the perfect option for winter. The insulating layer will prevent the heat from escaping the body and will keep warm. Silk doesn't provide as much support as cotton and other materials. Hence, it is not a suitable option for all day use and is meant for special occasions.


## Elastane

Elastane fibers are made of polyurethane and commonly known under the trade names Lycra and Spandex. Elastane is often used in applications where a permanent elasticity is necessary as it has the ability to provide the desired elasticity in knitted fabrics with a low percentage blend. High elasticity even in low concentration blends. In sportswear, almost all garments have a blend containing elastane since it enables freedom of body movement by reducing the fabric resistance. The use of elastane blends results in difficulties when recycling garments since it is necessary to separate the different fibers. Elastane is considered to be an environmentally unfriendly fiber because of its production where non-organic and hazardous solvents are used [24].


## Conclusion

Comfort is the most important property for underwear. Men tend to prefer cellulosic-based fabrics in underwear. Synthetic fabrics are often perceived as sportier as and cooler than cellulosic-based fabrics and are highly associated with sporty, good breathability, high quality, and good support, comfortable and stay dry. India is moving from plain cotton underwear to designer vest with advanced fabrics that serve the purpose of active wear and follows some trends and style. The new emerging trend in the innerwear industry is the variety of fabric that is used for the underwear. People prefer these fabrics due to comfort as well as the fit of the same. Stretchable underwear of perfect fit and style are available in the Indian market and manufacturers are planning to expand by looking at the growing segment of the innerwear market. With some of the modern technologies being incorporated in the innerwear segment, the future of this industry looks promising.
