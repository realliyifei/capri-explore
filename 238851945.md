Background

## Results

In this study, more than 20% of the participants scored above the cut-off score for insomnia and almost 40% screened positive for mild problems with sleep. All these results are indicating an exacerbation of sleep disturbances. Although there is an increased prevalence of sleep disorders among respondents, these changes were not directly associated with the presence of the infection or its severity, but rather with various demographic, socio-economic variables and nally with the presence of a pre-existing psychiatric disorder.


## Conclusions

In conclusion, sleep disorders among students and employees are a major health issue associated with great psychological burden. Up to date, research of insomnia during a pandemic crisis is limited. To the best of our knowledge, this was the rst study to explore sleep di culties during the COVID-19 pandemic in students and employees in Romania. This study uncovered a high-level of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, single people, or presence of psychiatric disorders were more susceptible to sleep di culties.


## Background

On 31 December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, from China, reported a cluster of pneumonia cases, and following that, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred and aroused global attention [1] In March 2020, the World Health Organization o cially declared that COVID-The questioner was completed by 622 persons and 620 responses were validated (331 students and 289 workers). The majority of the respondents were female (N = 464) and 4 out of 5 were young adults aged between 18 and 35 years. Regarding the level of education, 57.1% of the respondents have an academic degree (bachelor, master, doctoral). Regarding marital status 65.8% were in a relationship (cohabitating couple, married), the rest of them were not in a relationship (single, divorced, widowed). All demographic, socio-economic characteristics, as well as any underlying conditions are presented in Table 1. Benzodiazepine 6 (40%)

Regarding COVID-19 disease, 16% tested positive for SARS-Cov2, of which 65% had a mild form. A great number of individuals had close people detected with COVID-19 and 7.1% had close people who died of COVID-19 (Table 2). Using the prede ned cut-offs of the AIS scoring system to screen for sleep disturbances, we found that every second participant in the survey (374, 60.32%) had impaired sleep quality. With scores between 6 and 10, more than one third of the respondents (n = 242, 39.03%) screened positive for mild sleep problems, while 132 (21.29%) of them screened positive for insomnia (score ≥ 11).

In the student population, sleep induction was more affected comparing to employees' group (p = 0.013, df = 3, Phi = 0.132, moderate association). Also, the perception of physical and mental functioning during the day (p < 0.001, df = 3, Phi = 0.206, strong association) and sleepiness during daytime (p < 0.001, df = 3, Phi = 0.189, strong association) are more prevalent among students. In contrast, awakenings during the night are more prevalent among employees (p < 0.001, df = 3, Phi = 0.185, strong association) and the nal awakening also was found to be earlier than desired (p = 0.002, df = 3, Phi = 0.155, strong association). Overall, the AIS results are not signi cantly different between students and employees (p = 0.140, df = 1).

Women reported more frequently by impairment of total sleep duration (p = 0.032, df = 3, Phi = 0.119, moderate correlation); and overall poorer quality of sleep regardless of the total duration of sleep (p = 0.042, df = 3, Phi = 0.115, moderate correlation). Furthermore, AIS scores were signi cantly higher for women, (Mean Differences-1,027: women's mean score = 6.39, men' s mean score = 5.37), p = 0.007, Levene's test = 0.001. The frequency of awakenings during night increase with age (p < 0.001, df = 6, Phi = 0.248, strong correlation), as well as awakenings earlier than the desired time (p = 0.004, df = 6, Phi = 0.202, strong corelation). Drowsiness during the day is more prevalent at younger ages (p < 0.001, df = 6, Phi = 0.251, large association).

Single people (divorced, widowed, single) experienced more often awakenings during the night compared to those who are married or in a relationship (p < 0.001, df = 12, Phi = 0.369, strong association). On the other hand, married people have a tendency to wake up in the morning before the setting time more often (p = 0.040, df = 12, Phi = 0.184, strong association).

There are no signi cant differences between respondents from urban areas or countryside related to AIS scale scores (p = 0.084, df = 1).

Taking care of an older person is associated with delay in falling asleep (p = 0.037, df = 3, Phi = 0.117, moderate association) and waking before the desired time (p = 0.003, df = 3, Phi = 0.173, strong association). Participants who care for older people have more often clinically signi cant scores on AIS scale (p = 0.024, df = 3, Phi = 0.091, weak association).

Pet owners have a shorter duration of fall asleep (p = 0.036, df = 3, Phi = 0.117, moderate association) however, they experience more sleepiness during the day (p = 0.028, df = 3, Phi = 0.121, moderate association). However, in terms of AIS total score there are no differences between pet owners and those who do not own pets.

Lower educational levels associate higher levels of dysfunctionality during the day (p < 0.001, df = 2, Phi = 0.199, strong association). Nonetheless, AIS total score is not it is not statistically signi cant in uenced by educational level.

Regarding household size and his composition, participants who live with their partners had a shorter time to fall asleep (p = 0.008, df = 3, Phi = 0.150, strong association) and daytime sleepiness was associated less often in this group (p = 0.019, df = 3, Phi = 0.139, moderate association). At the same time, the perception of functioning during the day was better for the participants who live with their partner (p = 0.022, df = 3, Phi = 0.136, moderate association). Altogether, participants who live with partner had normal scores at AIS test, lower than 5 (p = 0.024, df = 1, Phi = 0.099, week association) which also, at quantitative statistical test was equivalent with lower values (p = 0.017, Mean Rank for the participants who live with their partner = 244.63, and the mean rank for the participants who don`t = 275.99).

Studied participants that are living with their children experienced more frequently awakenings during the night (p = 0.018, df = 2, Phi = 0.116, moderate association), but they did not experience daytime sleepiness (p = 0.001, df = 1, Phi = 0.146, moderate association) and had a good functioning during the day (p = 0.001, df = 3, Phi = 0.176, strong association). In contrast, those who live with their parents experienced less frequently awakenings during the night (p = 0.047, df = 2, Phi = 0.108, moderate association), but still they associated sleepiness during the day more often (p = 0.022, df = 3, Phi = 0.136, moderate association). Living with grandparents was associated with a longer time to fall asleep (p < 0.001, df = 3, Phi = 0.211, strong association) and worse quality of sleep (p = 0.020, df = 3, Phi = 0.138, moderate association). A worse quality of sleep was observed also in the participants who live with a roommate (p = 0.027, df = 3, Phi = 0.133, moderate association), who also declared a worse state of wellbeing during the day (p = 0.023, df = 3, Phi = 0.135, moderate association).

Low-and middle-income participants have longer times until they fall asleep (p = 0.046, df = 15, Phi = 0.217, strong association). Higher income participants present slowness during the day more frequently (p = 0.014, df = 15, Phi = 0.224, strong association). Despite these particularities, no difference in AIS total score was associated with monthly income (p = 0.233). In relation to weekly working hours, people who work more feel more often that sleep duration is not enough (p = 0.050, df = 12, Phi = 0.181, strong association).

Participants with comorbidities do not exhibit clinically signi cant scores (over 6) on the AIS more frequently than participants without comorbidities, with the exception of psychiatric disorders, like depression, anxiety, bipolar affective disorder, which are associated in the studied group with awakening during the night (p = 0.001, df = 3, Phi = 0.206, strong association), awakening before desired time (p = 0.029, df = 3, Phi = 0.146, moderate association) and unsatisfactory total duration and quality of sleep (p = 0.035, df = 3, Phi = 0.118, moderate association; p = 0.003, df = 3, Phi = 0.150, strong association). Additionally, participants with mental disorders presented more frequently the next day consequences of insomnia: less wellbeing (p < 0.001), worse functioning (p < 0.001) and sleepiness (p = 0.010) during the daytime. After all, participants with mental disorders associated higher scores on AIS (p < 0.001, df = 1, Phi = 0.165, strong association).

Regarding COVID-19 status, there were no signi cant differences between participants in the study who were infected with SARS-CoV2 and those who were not, and there was no difference on insomnia scale in relation to the time interval elapsed since infection with SARS-CoV2 or the severity of associated symptoms of the infection. Moreover, infection or death due to COVID-19 of loved ones is not a risk factor for sleep disturbances in the studied group.


## Discussion

This web-based study revealed numerous interesting aspects related to sleep quality. Insomnia seems to be affecting more individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Distress levels rise during an infection outbreak due to worry about health, changes in social life and daily routine and nally, nancial concerns.

In this study, more than 20% of the participants scored above the cut-off score for insomnia. This percentage is at the upper limit of the worldwide insomnia prevalence, estimated before the pandemic between 3.9% and 22% [22]. Additionally, almost 40% screened positive for minor problems with sleep. All these results are indicating an exacerbation of sleep disturbances. According to a meta-analysis, the prevalence of sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic is high and affects approximately 40% of people from general population [23]. Although there is an increased prevalence of sleep disorders among respondents, these changes were not directly associated with the presence of the infection or its severity, but rather with various demographic, socio-economic variables and last but not least with the presence of a pre-existing psychiatric disorder.

Students associated more frequently the next day consequences of insomnia (overall functioning and sleepiness during the day), while for workers more prevalent were awakenings during the night and early morning awakening. Regarding sociodemographic factors, insomnia score was signi cantly higher in women and awakenings during the night was a sleep disturbance associated with ageing. Partnered (married or cohabiting) participants at the time of the sleep study had better sleep quality, although household size and its composition did not in uence sleep patterns. Participants who take care of older people have more often sleep disturbance, elderly care being associated with delay in falling asleep and waking before the desired time.

However, there are some limitations to our study that need to be considered. We used a self-reported questionnaire to gather data, which is prone to response (extreme response, social desirability) and recall (inaccurate memory) biases. On the other hand, online surveys suffer from two main methodological limitations: limited access to certain portals, and respondents with biases may select themselves into the sample, thus more robust research on insomnia during a pandemic crisis is necessary.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, sleep disorders among students and employees are a major health issue associated with great psychological burden. Up to date, research of insomnia during a pandemic crisis is limited. To the best of our knowledge, this was the rst study to explore sleep di culties during the COVID-19 pandemic in students and employees in Romania. This study uncovered a high-level of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, single people, or presence of psychiatric disorders were more susceptible to sleep di culties.
