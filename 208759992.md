10.1039/c9ra06623c
Hosta plantaginea (Lam.) Aschers, as a traditional folk medicine, has been widely used both as a single herb and in prescriptions in Asia mainly due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. A total of 101 compounds including steroids, flavonoids, alkaloids and others have been isolated from H. plantaginea.Modern pharmacology has revealed that H. plantaginea possesses various therapeutic effects such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antibacterial effects both in vitro and in vivo. Although a number of reports on the chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of this plant are available, there is limited research on the bioactive constituents and the mechanism of the biological activities of H.plantaginea. Thus, it is essential to strengthen the research on bioactive constituents and their mechanisms as well as their structure-function relationships in H. plantaginea. Up to now, only three compounds have been established for the quality control of H. plantaginea. However, a comprehensive review on the botany, traditional use, phytochemistry, quality control and pharmacology information about this plant has not been reported so far; thus, a systematic and comprehensive review is very necessary. Therefore, this paper provided a comprehensive overview on the botany, traditional use, phytochemistry, quality control and pharmacology of H. plantaginea and also provided evidence for its further research and clinical applications.

## Introduction

Hosta Tratt. is a genus in the family Liliaceae, which comprises about 43 species mainly distributed in the temperate and subtropical zones of Asia, particularly in Japan and China. [1][2][3][4][5][6] Hosta plants are commonly used ornamentally or for medicine and are thus widely cultivated in parks and botanical gardens throughout the region. 2,7 Only four native species have been found in China, namely, H. plantaginea, H. ventricosa (Salisb.) Stearn, H. ensata F. Maekawa and H. albofarinosa D. Q. Wang, which are widely cultivated in parks and/or commonly used as folk medicine in China. 2,8,9 Among them, H. plantaginea is a perennial herb widely cultivated in China; it is used as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and is known as Yu zan (Chinese name ). The dried whole plants, leaves, roots and owers of this plant have been used as local and traditional medicine in China, Japan and South Korea. [10][11][12] Chinese people call the owers of H. plantaginea yu-zan-hua, and they are also named bai-e-hua, bai-he-hua and nei-xiao-hua; they have long been commonly used in traditional Mongolian medicine for the treatment of inammatory and painful diseases, such as sore throat, muteness, lung heat and toxic heat. 10,[13][14][15][16] Moreover, yuzan-hua was the main herb in the prescriptions of the Yuzan qingyan shiwuwei pill, Yuzan qingyan shiwuwei powder and Qinyan liuwei powder (Fig. 1).

H. plantaginea is enriched in multiple structurally diverse and biologically important steroids and avonoids. Modern pharmacology has revealed that H. plantaginea has anti-inammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-cancer, antioxidant and other biological activities. [17][18][19] Up to now, a large number of studies focused on the phytochemistry and pharmacology of H. plantaginea have been published. However, a comprehensive review on the botany, traditional use, phytochemistry, quality control and pharmacology information about this plant has not been reported; thus, a systematic and comprehensive review is very necessary. In this review, we systematically summarized the progress in the botany, traditional use, phytochemistry and quality control studies of H. plantaginea over the past decades, with all the elucidated compounds listed. The biological characterization of the extracts and constituents isolated from this plant were also discussed. It is hoped that the information presented in this paper will be useful for the full utilization of H. plantaginea for new drug development and pharmaceutical applications.


## Botany


## Morphology

As a perennial herbaceous plant, H. plantaginea grows to 40-80 centimeter. The calyx has several to a dozen owers: the owers are sessile, ovate or lanceolate, 2.5-7 cm long, and 1-1.5 cm wide; the inner sepals are very small. Also, the owers are solitary or sometimes in clusters of 2 or 3 and fragrant; the pedicel is about 1 cm. The perianth is white, funnel form, and 10-13 cm in size. The stamens are slightly shorter than or subequaling perianth; the laments are adnate to the perianth tube near base. The capsule is cylindrical, about 6 Â 1 cm, and 3-angled. The owering stages range from July to August. The rhizome is 1.5-2 cm thick and stout. The petiole grows from 20 to 40 cm in length; the leaf blade is ovate-cordate, -orbicular, or ovate, 14-25 Â 8-16 cm, glabrous, veins in 6-10 pairs, base cordate, margin slightly undulate, and apex abruptly acute. Scape 40-80 cm. Raceme: several to more than 10-owered, bracts 2 subtending each ower, outer one ovate or lanceolate, 2.5-7 Â 1-1.5 cm; the inner one is very small. 2 


## Traditional use


## Medicinal use

H. plantaginea was listed for medicinal use rst in "Ben Cao Pin Hui Jing Yao" during the Ming Dynasty more than ve hundred years ago. Because of their versatile biological and pharmacological activities, the H. plantaginea plants have been traditionally used in China, Japan and South Korea. In traditional Chinese medicine, the owers were used as an oral medicine for sore throat, muteness, lung heat, and toxic heat. The whole plants or leaves were applied to inammatory mass, hemorrhoids and snake bite, and the roots were taken orally for inammatory mass, vomiting blood and osteophytes. 10,13,14 In the TCM culture, H. plantaginea is described as acrid in taste, a little cold in nature and attributive to the stomach, lung and liver meridians. According to Bencao Gangmu and Zhong's previous reports, 20,21 the roots of H. plantaginea were used as Sinopodophyllum emodi (Wall) Ying to treat cancer in Japan because of their very similar morphology and efficacy. Meanwhile, the roots were applied to dermatitis in South Korea. 22 The prescriptions related to the owers of H. plantaginea recorded in TCM were the Yuzan qingyan shiwuwei pill, Yuzan qingyan shiwuwei powder and Qinyan liuwei powder, which are used for the treatment of sore throat, muteness, lung heat and toxic heat. Studies on the side effects and safety evaluations of this plant are very limited although it is widely used in TCM.


## Non-medicinal use

In addition to its use in medicine, the owers, young leaves and buds of H. plantaginea are used as a daily food material to eat or drink in some cities of China. 23,24 The owers of H. plantaginea are very beautiful with concentrated fragrance; thus, the plant is oen placed at home or office. 25,26 Moreover, H. plantaginea is commonly used ornamentally and thus widely cultivated in the parks and botanical gardens in China. 3,4,6,27,28 Additionally, H. plantaginea is an ombrophyte and has the advantages of rapid reproduction, easy growth and strong resistance; thus, it is commonly used for vegetation protection. 27,28


## Phytochemistry

Up to now, 101 chemical constituents have been isolated and identied from H. plantaginea, including steroids, avonoids, alkaloids, phenylethanols, acetophenones, and others (Table 1). Among them, steroids and avonoids are considered to be the primary bioactive constituents of this herbal medicine.


## Steroids

Steroids were regarded as the major bioactive principle of H. plantaginea, and phytochemical researchers were focused on these species since 1997. 11 Until now, 30 steroid compounds have been isolated and identied from H. plantaginea (Fig. 2). The sugar moieties in the carbohydrate part of steroidal saponins are b-D-glucose, b-D-galactose, a-L-rhamnose and b-Dxylose; in contrast, in terms of aglycones as the core of these compounds, there are ve different types, namely, spirostanes (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19), stigmastanes (20-23), furostanes (24 and 25), C22 steroids (26), and C21 steriods (27)(28)(29)(30), as shown in Fig. 2, where the sugar groups are usually attached to the C-3 position of aglycones. By comparison, it can be clearly seen that spirostanes are mainly found as glycosides in this plant, including four different subtypes: gitogenin (1-11), tigogenin (12), neogitogenin (13), manogenin (14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19).


## Flavonoids

Flavonoids consist of a large group of polyphenolic compounds with benzo-g-pyrone structures, which are ubiquitously present in plants; there is no exception for the H. plantaginea plants.

Flavonoids are another major bioactive constituents in H. plantaginea and they are divided into three categories, namely,

## Alkaloids

The H. plantaginea plants are also rich in alkaloids, and some of them show notable inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). 43 To date, 20

alkaloids have been isolated and identied from H. plantaginea. These alkaloids include 18 benzylphenethylamine alkaloids (55-72) and two b-carboline alkaloids (73 and 74) (Fig. 4). Hostasinine A (55) is a benzylphenethylamine alkaloid with a novel skeleton featuring a C-4-C-6 linkage and a nitrone moiety. Moreover, other 17 benzylphenethylamine alkaloids (56-72) represent ve skeletal types of alkaloids, namely, lycoreniene-type (56-59 and 66-68), isocarbostyril-type (69), crinine-type (60-63 and 70), lycorine-type (64, 65 and 71), and galanthamine-type (72). 


## Phenylethanols and acetophenones


## Phenylpropanoids

Phenylpropanoids also represent a relatively small class of compounds in H. plantaginea. To date, only two phenylpropanols (81 and 82) and three phenylpropionic acids (83-85) have been obtained from the ethanolic extract of H. plantaginea (Fig. 6). 38,40 


## Terpenoids

To date, only two monoterpenes (86 and 87) and three megastigmanes (88-90) have been obtained from the ethanolic extract of H. plantaginea (Fig. 7). 44,45


## Aliphatics

Some studies have been carried out to investigate the aliphatic compounds in H. plantaginea. Seven aliphatics (91-97) have been isolated from the owers and leaves of H. plantaginea (Fig. 8).


## Others

In addition to the above-mentioned main components, other components have also been found in the owers of H. plantaginea, such as 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (98), 40 4-hydroxy-3methoxybenzene (99), 31 (2-methyl)heptyl phthalate (100), 31 and (2-methylphenyl) (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-diene-3pentanone (101) 31 (Fig. 9).


## Quality Control

Quality control is very important for the use of TCMs. Many rapid, sensitive and stable technologies such as UPLC-MS, HPLC and UV have been applied for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of H. plantaginea. [47][48][49][50][51][52] To date, only three compounds, namely, kaempferol (31), kaempferol-7-O-b-Dglucoside (33) and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (37) have been used as quantitative markers by HPLC or UPLC-MS. Interestingly, the contents of compound 31 were found to be 0.0025%, 0.33-0.56%, 0.29-0.44% and 0.020% in the owers of H. plantaginea by different research groups. 47,[49][50][51] Moreover, the contents of compounds 33 and 37 were found to be 0.0058% and 0.090% by UPLC-MS, respectively. 46 In addition, the content of total saponins was found to be 1.61-4.70% in the owers of H. plantaginea by ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectrophotometry. 52 Furthermore, Li and co-authors established the ngerprint of the owers of H. plantaginea by HPLC. 48 In fact, the harvest times, geographical locations, and other factors can affect the contents of the active compounds in the owers of H. plantaginea, which should be considered when assessing their clinical efficacies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to determine other bioactive markers using various chromatographic and spectroscopic means to establish the comprehensive quality standards for this medicinal plant.


## Pharmacology

H. plantaginea has long been used in China, Japan, Korea and other countries because of its various pharmacological effects. In recent years, research reports on the chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of H. plantaginea have shown an increasing trend. Modern pharmacology has revealed that H. plantaginea has anti-inammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-cancer, antioxidant and other biological activities.


## Anti-inammatory and analgesic activities

In TCM, the whole plants, leaves, roots and owers of H. plantaginea have been used as local and traditional ethnic medicine for the treatment of sore throat, inammatory mass, dysuria, lung heat, snake bite and others. In agreement with the traditional usage of H. plantaginea, several studies have illustrated that this plant possesses anti-inammatory and analgesic effects both in vitro and in vivo. The anti-inammatory abilities against cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 enzymes were evaluated. Flavonoid compounds 31-40, 42-45 and 48 showed signicant inhibitory activities against COX-1 and COX-2 at a concentration of 50 mM, with the inhibition ratios ranging from 53.00% to 80.55% for COX-1 and from 52.19% to 66.29% for COX-2. Further detailed testing showed that these compounds inhibited the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes with the IC 50 values of 12.90-46.16 mM in comparison with the positive control celecoxib with    Review the IC 50 values of 9.00 mM for COX-1 and 1.04 mM for COX-2. [37][38][39] Thus, avonoids are supposed to contribute to the anti-inammatory effect of H. plantaginea.

In vivo, at the doses of 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 g kg À1 (raw herb), different concentrations of ethanol (50%, 65%, 80% and 95%) crude extracts obtained from the owers of H. plantaginea showed moderate anti-inammatory effects in a xylene-induced ear oedema mouse model. 53 Moreover, the crude extract, ethyl acetate fraction and n-BuOH fraction showed a signicant anti-inammatory effect in xylene-induced mouse ear oedema, acetic acid-induced writhing and carrageenan-induced oedema from different research groups. 32,54,55 In addition, the leaves of H. plantaginea, Yu-Zan-Qing-Yan-Shi-Wu-Wei powder and Yu-Zan-Qing-Yan-Shi-Wu-Wei pill have good therapeutic effects on patients with acute and chronic pharyngitis. [56][57][58] In 2010, the analgesic activity of H. plantaginea was studied in vivo. 59 The oral administration of a 50% ethanol extract of the H. plantaginea owers (0.5 and 2.0 g kg À1 , raw herb) caused a signicant analgesic effect in an acetic acid-induced writhing mouse model with the inhibition of 39.28% and 53.41%, respectively; the positive control drug xiao-yan-tong pill displayed inhibition of 67.07% at a concentration of 0.1 g kg À1 . Moreover, 50% ethanol extract of the owers of H. plantaginea also had a signicant antinociceptive effect in the hot plate mouse model at a dose of 2.0 g kg À1 compared with the control group.


## Anti-cancer activity

The crude extracts and steroids from H. plantaginea have signicant activities against tumor cells such as the L615, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, SMMC-7721, HL-60, Jurkat, K562, HepG2, MDCK, and YAC-A cell lines in vitro. However, no study has been conducted on the anti-cancer activity of H. plantaginea in vivo.

The ethanol extract from the owers of H. plantaginea exhibited signicant anti-cancer activity against the L615 tumor cells. 14 The steroid compounds 2, 15, and 25 exhibited signicant anti-cancer activities against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and SMMC-7721 tumor cells. 31 Moreover, compounds 8-10 exhibited signicant anti-cancer activities against the leukaemia HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner with the IC 50 values of 2.9, 1.0 and 1.7 mg mL À1 , respectively. 11 In addition, compounds 1, 4, 5, and 7-11 exhibited signicant or moderate anti-cancer activities against leukaemia HL-60, Jurkat, and K562 cells and others (Table 2). 30,60 Thus, steroids are supposed to contribute to the anti-cancer effect of H. plantaginea.


## Antioxidant activity

Recently, some studies have revealed the anti-oxidative effect of the compounds in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay in vitro. [37][38][39]45 The  


## Other biological activities

In modern research, the H. plantaginea plant has been reported to have a variety of activities besides the above-mentioned elds. The roots of H. plantaginea are considered to be effective on recalcitrant contact dermatitis in patients. 22 Additionally, the whole plants of H. plantaginea can improve bone hyperplasia in patients. 61 


## Conclusion and future perspectives

This review summarized information on the botany, traditional use, phytochemistry, quality control and pharmacology of H. plantaginea. The amount of data gathered from different studies revealed that this medicinal plant is rich in many secondary metabolites and vast biological active constituents. However, the bioactive constituent action mechanisms and their structure-function relationships need to be investigated for further development into therapeutics. Systematic efficacy studies are necessary to examine the standardized extracts of H. plantaginea and to identify the bioactive constituents responsible for the pharmacological effects. Furthermore, the anti-inammatory activity and its mechanisms are limited, which consequently limit the use of this medicinal plant to treat inammation-related diseases. The secondary metabolites of steroids and avonoids from H. plantaginea may be drug candidates for treating inammationrelated diseases because of their potent anti-inammatory activities. To this end, no study has been performed to evaluate the toxic effects of H. plantaginea. However, further clinical evaluation must be performed to perceive the detailed effect of this plant on humans.

We believe that this review can be of particular value by providing fundamental insights into the medicinal value of this plant. Moreover, this review can provide a reference for clinical medication, sustainable development and utilization of this plant.

Among them, kaempferol (31) and its derivatives (32-46) as well as quercetin (47) belong to avonols, which are the main active ingredients of H. plantaginea and most of them are avonoid glycosides with 3-and/or 7-linked glycans. In fact, 22 avonoids were isolated and identied from the owers of H. plantaginea by us and in Yu's previous work in 2017-2019.


Phenylethanols and acetophenones represent a relatively small class of compounds in H. plantaginea. To date, only three phenylethanols, namely, phenethyl-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (75), phenethanol-b-D-gentiobioside (76) and phenethyl-O-rutinoside (77) have been obtained from the ethanolic extract of H. plantaginea. 38,40 Moreover, three acetophenones, namely, 4-hydroxylacetophenone (78), acetophenone-4-O-b-D-glucoside (79) and 2-hydroxyl-6-methoxyacetophenone-4-O-b-D-glucoside (80) have also been isolated from H. plantaginea(Fig. 5).40
