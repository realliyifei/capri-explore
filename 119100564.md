THE PALOMAR DISTANT CLUSTER SURVEY: I. THE CLUSTER CATALOG

Astronomical Journal
Received 1 August 1995; accepted Novemeber 1995Subject headings: galaxies: clustering; cosmology: observations { 3 {
We present an optical/near IR selected catalog of 79 clusters distributed over an area of 5.1 square degrees. The catalog was constructed from images obtained with the 4-Shooter CCD mosaic camera on the Hale 5m telescope operating in \scan" mode. The survey, hereafter known as the Palomar Distant Cluster Survey (PDCS), was conducted in two broad band lters that closely resemble V and I. The 4 limiting magnitudes for our 300 s exposures are 23.8 (V ) and 22.5 (I). A matched lter algorithm was developed and employed to identify the cluster candidates by using positional and photometric data simultaneously. The clusters cover the range 0:2 < z < 1:2, based on the redshift estimates derived in the cluster detection procedure. An accurate selection function is generated from extensive simulations. We nd that the cumulative surface density of clusters with richness class R 1 is about a factor of 5 higher than the extrapolated density of R 1 Abell clusters. The PDCS results are consistent with a constant comoving density of clusters to z < 0:6, albeit at the above high density level. Constraints on cluster abundances at z > 0:6 will be possible with the acquisition of spectroscopic redshifts for a large subset of these cluster candidates. We also present a supplemental catalog of 28 clusters that do not satisfy all our selection criteria but which include some of the most distant systems detected in the survey. Finding charts for all 107 cluster candidates are provided. (Astro-ph readers: due to their large size, the nding charts are not included in this version of the paper).Subject headings: galaxies: clustering; cosmology: observations { 3 { { 5 { associated with CCD readout; one is exposing essentially 100% of the time), 2) Data taken in TDI mode can be extremely well at-elded (see Schneider, Schmidt, & Gunn 1994 and x2.3 of this paper). This property is especially important for these survey images, as the Texas Instruments CCDs have very poor fringing properties at near-infrared wavelengths. 3) The con guration of the 4-Shooter focal plane(Figure 1)is well-suited for two-lter observations in TDI mode.The PDCS data were obtained by moving the telescope north along lines of constant Right Ascension (equinox 1950.0) at a rate of 0 00 : 893 s 1 ; this yields a CCD transit time of 300 seconds. Because of the aforementioned pyramid shadowing in the 4-Shooter, the e ective exposure time is 293 seconds. The data are acquired in two colors, nearly simultaneously, by making use of the fact that the 4-Shooter can be equipped with one set of lters for the leading two cameras (CCDs 1 and 4, seeFigure 1) in the scan and another set for the trailing ones (CCDs 2 and 3).A survey eld consists of eight adjacent scans. Each scan requires approximately 80 minutes to complete and overlaps the adjacent scan by 30 00 . The total area imaged in each eld is usually slightly larger than a square degree (seeTable 1).Imaging of the ve elds began in October 1986 and required approximately three years to complete. The data were all obtained under photometric conditions. In order to maintain accurate star{galaxy classi cation and uniform completeness limits, only data with FWHM seeing better than 1 00 : 5 are used in this analysis. The median FWHM seeing in all slow-scan data obtained during the course of the observations is 1 00 : 40; the FWHM median seeing in data accepted for use in our cluster survey is 1 00 : 23.

## INTRODUCTION

The evolution of the space density of clusters, of their internal kinematics and spatial structure, of their large scale clustering properties, and of their host galaxy populations are fundamental predictions of all viable galaxy and cluster formation theories. The accuracy of the observational constraints on these parameters depends on the availability of statistically complete cluster catalogs over a large redshift range (0 < z < 1 and beyond). At redshifts less than 0.2, the available catalogs (Abell 1958;Zwicky et al. 1968;Shectman 1985;Abell, Olowin, & Corwin 1989, hereafter ACO;Lumsden et al. 1992 (Edinburgh-Durham); Dalton et al. 1994 (APM)) have all been based on the large photographic sky surveys done with the 1.2m Schmidt at Palomar Mountain and at the UK Schmidt at Siding Spring. These surveys have only recently become available in digital format and, consequently, only the Shectman, APM, and Edinburgh-Durham catalogs have been generated using automated and objective cluster detection algorithms. At higher redshifts, the catalogs are based on deep prime focus optical/near IR photographic plates taken on 4-5m class telescopes (Gunn, Hoessel, & Oke 1986, hereafter GHO;Couch et al. 1991). The low quantum e ciency of photographic material limits the completeness of these surveys beyond z 0:5. These catalogs have yielded important information on galaxy evolution (e.g., Butcher Gunn & Dressler 1988;Rakos & Schombert 1995) and on the clustering properties and space densities of low redshift clusters as a function of richness (e.g., Bahcall & Soneira 1983;Dalton et al. 1992;Nichol et al. 1992;Postman, Huchra, & Geller 1992). The Abell/ACO and Zwicky et al. cluster catalogs and the previously published optically selected cluster catalogs at higher (z > 0:3) redshifts were constructed via visual inspection, limiting their utility. For a cluster catalog to be statistically useful, it must be homogeneous and its selection biases must be accurately quanti ed. Furthermore, in order to compare the predictions of models to the observations reliably, the same cluster selection process that is used on the observations should be applicable to large scale simulations.

The 4-Shooter CCD mosaic camera on the Hale 5m (installed in 1983) was designed, in part, to conduct digital, two color surveys for distant (z < 1) clusters over a moderate area of sky. We present here the cluster catalog resulting from the rst such survey, hereafter referred to as the Palomar distant cluster survey (PDCS). We have developed a matched lter cluster selection algorithm which uses both positional and photometric data simultaneously to search for overdensities in the galaxy distribution. The algorithm works well over a large dynamic range in redshift and is optimal in the regime where one is looking for small signals in large backgrounds, as is the case for distant clusters. We have applied this algorithm to the uniform galaxy catalogs derived from our CCD data.

Section 2 of this paper describes the observations and their calibration. The construction of galaxy catalogs from the CCD data is discussed in section 3. Our cluster selection algorithm, the cluster selection criteria, the cluster catalog, the catalog completeness and the false positive rate are discussed in full detail in section 4. Preliminary constraints on the space density of optically selected clusters are discussed in section 5. The properties of the clusters in this catalog will be discussed in subsequent papers. The PDCS consists of ve separate elds. The shape of each eld is roughly a square that is 1 degree on a side. The elds are all located within or near the original high{latitude Gunn & Oke (1975) survey areas. In addition, eld centers were chosen to minimize the number of bright stars in the survey regions and to avoid very low-redshift (z < 0:1) clusters and regions with high reddening. There is one R = 1 Abell cluster, A 1739 (z est 0:17), located in our survey area. The coordinates of the eld centers are given in Table 1; the ve regions will be denoted in this paper as the 0 h , 2 h , 9 h , 13 h , and 16 h elds. The 2 h CCD survey eld is not included in the original Gunn & Oke survey; this eld is used in lieu of the original 3 h eld which su ers from high galactic extinction.

The PDCS was performed with the 4-Shooter CCD camera ) mounted at the cassegrain focus of the Hale telescope. The focal plane of the telescope is coincident with a re ective four-faceted pyramid in the 4-Shooter. The pyramid directs the incoming light into four reimaging cameras. The 4-Shooter detectors are four 800 800 Texas Instruments CCDs. The cameras produce an image scale of approximately 0.335 00 pixel 1 ; the instrument's entire eld of view is 8.9 0 on a side. A diagram of the 4-Shooter focal plane is given in Figure 1.

The CCDs are positioned so that there should be no gaps in sky coverage along the pyramid facets (there are typically about 20 rows/columns of pixels that do not see the sky due to pyramid shadowing), but the few arcseconds of sky located where the CCDs join are not usable because of imperfections in the pyramid surface along the facets. The e ective size of the eld for this project is 2 780 pixels, or a width of 520 00 . Images of each eld are obtained in two lters, the F555W and F785LP of HST's Wide Field/Planetary Camera (Gri ths 1990). To minimize confusion with the HST photometric systems, we will denote the 4-Shooter passbands as V 4 (F555W) and I 4 (F785LP); see x2.2 for a description of the PDCS photometric system. The limiting magnitude of the V 4 data is fainter than that of the I 4 observations (due to the fainter sky and higher detector sensitivity at 5500 A), but the I 4 images are in some respects just as important; at z > 0:6 the 4000 A \break" lies redward of the V 4 band, so the I 4 data provides the wavelength coverage needed to detect clusters out to z 1.

The data are acquired in Time-Delay-and-Integrate, or TDI, mode. (This is frequently called \scan" mode in the literature.) Details of how TDI observations are taken with the 4-Shooter, as well as the initial data processing of the data, are given in Schneider, Schmidt, & Gunn (1994). In TDI mode the sky is moved along the columns of the CCD at a constant rate; the CCDs are read so that the charge packet shifts one row in the time that it takes the sky to traverse one pixel. TDI mode was chosen for the PDCS for three reasons: 1) This is a very e cient method to image large sections of sky to moderate depth (there is no overhead 2.2. The PDCS Photometric System

The system response as a function of wavelength for the lter+4-Shooter+telescope are shown in Figure 2. The lower curve for each lter is the quantum e ciency through 1.2 airmasses from Palomar; this is the response curve used to calculate lter properties (e.g., e ective wavelengths) and transformations to other photometric systems.

The e ective wavelengths and widths of the lters, following the de nitions in Schneider, Gunn, & Hoessel (1983) and Gri ths (1990), are 5430 A and 1230 A for V 4 and 8690 A and 1400 A for I 4 . The e ective wavelength of the V 4 band is 100 A bluer than that of V , and V 4 is about 50% wider than V . I 4 has nearly the same width as the Kron-Cousins I band (Cousins 1976; this band will be denoted as I KC ), but the e ective wavelength of I 4 is about 500 A redder than that of I KC . The I 4 band has some sensitivity at wavelengths longward of 10,500 A.

The zero points of the V 4 ,I 4 magnitudes are based on the AB magnitude system of Oke & . Objects whose spectral energy distribution are constant in terms of ergs s 1 cm 1 Hz 1 have neutral color in an AB-based system. The magnitudes of Vega { 6 { are V 4 = +0.03 and I 4 = +0:46. The V 4 ,I 4 magnitudes for the fundamental standard of the Gunn system, the F subdwarf BD +17 4708 (de ned as magnitude 9.500 in all bands), are 9.45 and 9.20, respectively. Magnitudes in the V 4 ,I 4 system for the six standard stars that provided the photometric calibration for the PDCS are listed in Table 2. (Kent 1985 gives coordinates and g; r magnitudes for these stars.)

Since the V 4 and I 4 lters are quite broad, it is impossible to de ne precise transformations to other photometric systems when dealing with galaxies with a wide range of redshifts and spectral energy distributions. We have calculated approximate transformations from V 4 and I 4 measurements to a number of other photometric systems that are frequently used in studies of faint galaxies and/or clusters. In addition to V and I KC , we present the transformations to B J ( e = 4390 A, Gullixson et al. 1994), and the g ( e = 4910 A), r ( e = 6530 A), and i ( e = 7860 A), bands of Thuan & Gunn (1976) and Wade et al. (1979). (Also see Kent 1985 for further information on the g and r photometric systems.) The rough transformations were derived by synthesizing magnitudes from the spectrophotometric atlas of stars of Gunn & Stryker (1983), and restricting the ts to objects with (V 4 I 4 < +3). B J = V 4 + 0:29 + 0:676 (V 4 I 4 ) 0:083 (V 4 I 4 ) 2 (1) g = V 4 + 0:04 + 0:295 (V 4 I 4 )

(2) V = V 4 0:02 0:056 (V 4 I 4 ) + 0:012 (V 4 I 4 ) 2 (3) r = V 4 + 0:13 0:514 (V 4 I 4 ) + 0:055 (V 4 I 4 ) 2 (4) i = I 4 + 0:27 + 0:145 (V 4 I 4 )

(5) I KC = I 4 0:43 + 0:089 (V 4 I 4 )

The average rms scatter about the above relations is a few hundredths of a magnitude. The correction for Galactic extinction for the V 4 and I 4 lters is A V 4 = A V = 3:05 E(B V ) (7) A I 4 = 0:497 A V 4 = 1:52 E(B V )

where E(B V ) values are derived from the procedure presented in Burstein & Heiles (1982). Reddening corrections for the ve survey elds are given in Table 1. Figures 3a{c show the V 4 and I 4 k-corrections and expected V 4 I 4 colors as functions of redshift, respectively, for ve morphological types: E, Sab, Sbc, Scd, and Im. The spectral energy distributions are from Coleman et al. (1980) and no spectral evolution is assumed.


### TDI Image Data Processing

The raw data from a 4-Shooter TDI observation form a continuous pixel stream 816 columns wide and approximately 51,000 rows long (800 rows are generated every 300 seconds { 7 { for each CCD). To take advantage of the large amount of existing picture-based image processing software, the data from each CCD are subdivided into 816 800 frames with an 80 pixel (26 00 : 8) overlap introduced in the scan direction. The overlap allows reliable photometric and astrometric measurements of essentially all of the objects that fall near the boundaries of the image frames. The size of the overlap was chosen as a compromise between processing e ciency (larger overlaps mean more redundant processing) and the typical diameters of galaxies in moderate to high redshift clusters ( < 15 00 ). Analysis software may not accurately measure the parameters of galaxies with diameters larger than 80 pixels that are located in the overlap area. The number of such cases is extremely small (< 10 per square degree), and in any case they are not the targets of study of this program.

In TDI mode, the data can be used directly to construct a one-dimensional \sky at" vector that will produce extremely accurate measurements of the variation in pixel-to-pixel sensitivity perpendicular to the scan direction. No adjustment for pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations parallel to the scan direction is required in TDI mode. The median sky values in the V 4 and I 4 bands are 2400 DN pixel 1 ( 21.3 mag per arcsec 2 ) and 6000 DN pixel 1 ( 19.3 mag per arcsec 2 ), respectively; thus there is su cient signal to generate accurate at-eld vectors.

To correct for the relative zeropoint o sets between the two CCDs assigned to a given passband (e.g., CCDs 1 and 4 for the V 4 band), a sequence of raw frames from each CCD are debiased and then attened by multiplying the data by their corresponding sky at vector. A \balance factor" for each CCD, BF i , is computed using the expression BF i = 1 2 P N k=1 (Sky k;i + Sky k;j ) P N k=1 Sky k;i

where Sky k;i is the sky level in the k th frame from CCD i, Sky k;j is the sky level in the k th frame from CCD j, where j is the CCD assigned the same lter as CCD i, and N is the total number of frames processed for this calibration (usually four frames per CCD). The initial sky at vector is then multiplied by the balance factor to produce the nal, corrected sky at vector. This method of computing relative o sets distributes the o set correction between the two CCDs as opposed to applying the correction all to one CCD. The assumption underlying this approach is that sky level di erences between corresponding frames from CCDs with a given passband are due to di erent relative CCD zeropoints rather than actual sky variations on the scale of a few arcminutes. This quite reasonable assumption is supported both by the insensitivity of the derived balance factor values to the speci c frames used in the calculation and by the excellent agreement between the balance factors derived from the scans and those derived from V 4 and I 4 dome at exposures. The typical zeropoint o sets are 0 m : 36 and 0 m : 12 for the V 4 and I 4 CCDs, respectively (i.e., CCD 4 is 1.39 times more sensitive than CCD 1 in the V 4 band, and CCD 3 is 1.12 times more sensitive than CCD 2 in the I 4 band).

The CCD signature is removed from the raw data and, as a nal step, the median sky level as a function of row (scan direction) is t to a cubic polynomial. The appropriate linear, quadratic, and cubic components are subtracted from each image row. This process removes { 8 { any medium-term temporal variations in sky brightness and produces frames with extremely at sky levels (sky brightness levels measured in di erent regions in any given frame agree to within 0.002 mag per arcsec 2 ). Most frames are quite at even before applying the nal sky correction. The largest temporal variations in sky brightness across a frame seen in the data have amplitudes less than 2% of the mean sky level. One consequence of this sky correction is that the mean sky level will change in a non-continuous manner from frame to frame. Measurements of objects in the 80 pixel overlap region between frames shows that this has no in uence on number counts or object photometry and yields very stable object detection performance.


## GALAXY CATALOG CONSTRUCTION


### Object Detection and Classi cation

We used a modi ed version of the Faint Object Classi cation and Analysis System (Jarvis & Tyson 1981, Valdes 1982hereafter FOCAS) to detect, measure, and classify objects in the calibrated CCD images. The modi cations include new software to perform photometric classi cation of galaxies (discussed later in this section), the addition of object catalog parameters related to this photometric classi cation as well as a new object compactness parameter, and a variety of new image statistics, catalog editing, and quality assurance programs. The basic FOCAS object detection, point spread function (PSF) measurement, deblending, and star{galaxy{noise classi cation algorithms have not been altered.

As in the image calibration process, the frames are processed individually. The object isophotal detection threshold in each frame is set to be 3 sky above sky (typically 25.7 mag per arcsec 2 in the V 4 band and 24.8 mag per arcsec 2 in the I 4 band) and a minimum object area requirement of 15 pixels (1.68 arcsec 2 ) is imposed. Because the sky level is lower and the system response is higher in the V 4 band than in the I 4 band, the V 4 images are deeper. Consequently, about 40% of the objects detected in a typical V 4 image are undetected by FOCAS in the corresponding I 4 image. Nearly all the objects which are only detected in the V 4 band are faint (V 4 > 23). About 95% of the objects with V 4 23, however, are detected in both passbands.

After object detection, merged objects are deblended using the FOCAS splits routine. Approximately 15% of all detected objects with V 4 24 required deblending. Object parameters are evaluated (e.g., isophotal, core, and total magnitudes, axial ratio, intensityweighted and unweighted moments, etc.) and the FOCAS resolution object classi er is run on all of the objects. The PSF used by the resolution classi er is computed separately for each frame to compensate for variations in seeing that can occur during the course of a scan. Occasionally there is an insu cient number of suitable PSF stars in a frame for an accurate PSF to be measured; in such cases, the PSF from an adjacent frame (in the scan direction) is used for object classi cation.

FOCAS classi es objects based on the results of tting a series of templates derived from the observed PSF to each object. Speci cally, the templates are parameterized by t(r i ) = f p(r i =s) + (1 f) p(r i ) (10) where r i is the position of pixel i, p(r i ) is the observed PSF, s is the FOCAS resolution scale parameter, and f is the FOCAS fraction parameter. The object classi cation is determined from the values of s and f which yield the best t to the two-dimensional data. We adopted the following classi cation rules:

Noise 0:1 s 0:7 0 < f 1 Star 0:7 < s 1:3 0 < f 1 Fuzzy Star 1:3 < s 10 0 < f < 0:25 Galaxy 1:3 < s 10 0:25 f 1 Di use 10 < s 100 0 < f 1 Practically all \Fuzzy stars" are stellar objects and every di use object brighter than V 4 = 23 is a galaxy. The range of the scale parameter used to select stars was chosen to be broad enough to account for reasonable PSF variations that occur across a single 4-Shooter CCD but narrow enough to minimize galaxy misclassi cations. The 4-Shooter re-imaging cameras are relatively fast (f=1:84) and the PSF varies in shape from center to edge. In TDI mode, PSF variations due to the camera optics are a function of CCD column only. FOCAS currently does not allow one to use a variable PSF for object classi cation on a given CCD frame. The scale parameter range used to select stars was, therefore, chosen to be broad enough to account for reasonable PSF variations that occur across a single 4-Shooter CCD but narrow enough to minimize galaxy misclassi cations. We nd that there are position dependent star classi cation errors due to the PSF variations but the galaxy classi cations are not signi cantly a ected. This is primarily because galaxies dramatically outnumber stars at the magnitude limit of the present survey. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of the object classi cations is presented in x3.3.

Finally, we perform a crude morphological classi cation of the galaxies based on their radial surface brightness pro le. For galaxies with azimuthally averaged radial pro les extending for 1 00 : 34 or more, a comparison is made between the observed pro le and a library of seeing-convolved reference pro les for exponential disk and de Vaucouleurs (1948) r 1 4 models. The reference pro les span a wide range of e ective radii and axial ratios. A maximum likelihood technique is used to select the best t model. If the galaxy has an axial ratio greater than 2.5, only the disk models are used in the comparisons. A new { 10 { \total" magnitude is then computed by integrating the pro le of the best t model. This total magnitude, the e ective radius of the best t model, the 2 value of the t, and the pro le type (disk or de Vaucouleurs) are stored along with the other object parameters. The morphological classi cation algorithm reliably classi es pure disk or pure bulge systems down to V 4 = 22. At the survey limit, however, only about 50% of simulated r 1 4 galaxies are correctly classi ed. There is a classi cation bias in the present algorithm that results in galaxies with V 4 > 22.5 being preferentially classi ed as exponential disks.


### Photometric Calibration

Although all of the data were obtained under photometric conditions, very few observations of photometric standards were made on the nights that the scans were performed. Consequently, a bootstrap procedure was used for the nal photometric calibration of the PDCS.

All eight scans of a given eld were placed on a uniform ux scale by comparing the instrumental magnitudes of the objects located in the 30 00 overlap region between adjacent scans. This procedure is done for both the V 4 and I 4 data independently. The observation dates for some adjacent scans are separated by as much as two years; temporal variations in the re ectivity/transmission of the telescope and 4-Shooter optics will alter the photometric zero points. If the data are indeed photometric, then a single constant for each scan will su ce to place the data on a given instrumental system. If the observations were taken in nonphotometric conditions, this o set will vary with time. Figure 4 shows the photometric o set as a function of time (for the PDCS observations, the declination is linearly related to the time elapsed since the start of the scan) for four pairs of adjacent scans. The upper two panels show scans taken on the same night; as expected, there is no signi cant o set between scans. The lower two panels compare data for scans taken at times separated by more than a month; while there is a de nite change in the ux scale between adjacent scans, there is no evidence for any temporal variations. Objects with V 4 22 were used to measure the o set in the V 4 band data (I 4 21 in the I 4 band). The observed scatter is consistent with the estimated uncertainties in the FOCAS photometry ( 0:12 mag for a galaxy with V 4 = 22). The handful of points with discrepant o sets are from objects which straddle the overlap zones and, hence, their magnitudes cannot be accurately compared. These objects are excluded from zeropoint o set computations. The typical photometric o sets seen in the data are 0 m : 09 and 0 m : 10 in the V 4 and I 4 passbands, respectively. There are some cases where the o sets are as large as 0 m : 25. There is little indication of zeropoint drifts which would occur if the photometric quality of the sky varied during the course of a scan. The photometric o sets in each band are normalized to the scan with the best seeing; following this adjustment the data in each eld are on the same ux scale.

To place the observations on an absolute ux scale, we acquired three \fast" scans for each of the ve elds. The fast scans were taken in a direction perpendicular to the motion of the survey scans. The fast scans have an e ective exposure time of 98 seconds, span the entire width of the eld, and are centered on the northern, central, and southern segments of each eld. The fast scan data were obtained on three photometric nights (27 September 1987 and 12 and 13 March 1988) on which we also obtained observations of photometric standards (see Table 2 for a list of standards). In addition to providing the absolute photometric calibration, the data produced by the fast scans are used to tie the strips together in the astrometric calibration (x3.4).

The accuracy of the photometric calibration of the data can be measured by comparing number counts from the ve independent survey elds. Figures 5a and 5b show the di erential galaxy surface density as a function of V 4 and I 4 magnitude, respectively. Figure 6 shows the residuals between the mean galaxy surface density for all ve elds and the galaxy surface density in each individual eld as a function of V 4 and I 4 magnitude, respectively. All magnitudes have been corrected for Galactic extinction using the values in Table 1. The typical eld-to-eld number uctuations are 9% over the range 19 V 4 23:5 and 18:5 I 4 22. At V 4 < 19 (I 4 < 18:5), the number of galaxies is too small to yield reliable statistics; at V 4 > 23:8 (I 4 > 22:5) incompleteness sets in. The solid curve shows the observed rms uctuations averaged over all 5 survey elds. For comparison, the dashed curve shows the expected uctuations between elds of this area, given the observed angular two point correlation function derived from the galaxy survey of Neushaefer, Windhorst, & Dressler (1991). The observed uctuations are in very good agreement with the clustered distribution prediction, indicating that, on average, zeropoint uctuations between survey elds must be < 0 m : 09. This suggests that the galaxy catalogs are not seriously contaminated by misclassi ed stars, a conclusion con rmed by our checks on classi cation accuracy described in the next section. The systematic excess of galaxies in the 0 h eld is most likely due to a photometric zeropoint error (there is no particularly rich cluster of bright galaxies in this eld). A zeropoint error of 0 m : 20 (roughly a 2 deviation) in both passbands for the 0 h data is su cient to explain the excess at faint magnitudes (V 4 20) and to make the di erences at V 4 < 20 statistically insigni cant. Our cluster identi cation algorithm is insensitive to zeropoint errors of this magnitude. The good agreement in the faint galaxy counts between elds demonstrates that on very large scales ( > 600h 1 Mpc) the optical universe does appear to be homogeneous.


### Object Classi cation Accuracy

The uniformity of the log N gal -magnitude relationship from eld to eld is certainly a necessary but not su cient condition for con rming good classi cation accuracy. An additional check is to compare object classi cations from the V 4 and I 4 images. We obtain identical classi cations for 95% of the objects detected in both passbands when the object V 4 magnitude is 20.5 or brighter. For objects with V 4 22.5, identical classi cations are obtained 86% of the time. For the statistically complete survey used for cluster detection { 12 { (V 4 23.8), identical classi cations are obtained for 75% of the objects.

There are two reasons why object classi cation accuracy is not perfect. The rst is that the FOCAS classi er (and, indeed, most any classi er) breaks down for objects fainter than about 1 magnitude above the completeness limit. Near the limit, the signal-to-noise ratio is low (S/N 4 at V 4 = 23.8) and the mean object area is < 5 FWHM 2 , making reliable classi cation di cult. The second is that the PSF varies in shape from center to edge (cf., x3.1). Since we are using a single PSF per frame, classi cation accuracy should degrade somewhat near the east/west edges of every scan (in TDI mode, the PSF is a function of column only). We have attempted to minimize the latter e ect by allowing a 30% tolerance in the t to the mean PSF for objects classi ed as stars (c.f. x3.1); however, the e ect is nonetheless still present. Fortunately, the net result is to introduce only minor contamination of the galaxy catalogs, as shown in Figures 7 and 8. The star catalogs are more seriously contaminated. Statistical corrections are made to compensate for the contamination, as discussed below.

We now demonstrate the nature and amplitude of the misclassi cations. Figure 7a and 7b show the galaxy-to-star ratio (GSR) for the 13 h eld as a function of V 4 and I 4 magnitude, respectively (results for the other elds are very similar). The solid points represent the data for all objects regardless of CCD column; the open points represent data for objects with 200 CCD Column 600. The breakdown of the classi er at low signal-to-noise levels is the source of the turnover in the GSR in Figures 7a and 7b. The probability of a faint star being classi ed as a galaxy is higher than the probability of a faint galaxy being classi ed as a star. This has been veri ed by running the classi er on simulated CCD images. Galaxies outnumber stars by about 7 to 1 at V 4 23 and, consequently, even a small error in galaxy classi cation results in a big change in the faint star counts. For the same reason, the galaxy counts are not signi cantly a ected. For V 4 < 21 the GSR is essentially independent of CCD column. At fainter magnitudes, the GSR is systematically lower for objects located within the central 400 columns. This is precisely the trend expected from a PSF variation -the assumed PSF is rounder than the actual PSF near the east/west edges and hence relatively more stars are misclassi ed as galaxies in those areas. This is shown directly in Figures 8a and 8b which depict the number of stars and galaxies as a function CCD column number. There is an obvious drop in star counts in the 150 outermost columns. Again, the galaxy counts are not as noticeably a ected because galaxies vastly outnumber stars at V 4 23 and because the broadened PSF is still narrower than the typical galaxy pro le.

Using both the observed data and results from simulations, we have adopted e ective weighting factors to correct the galaxy counts depending on position and magnitude. At V 4 = 23.8 and I 4 = 22.5 (the limits adopted for the purpose of nding clusters) and near the east/west CCD edges the galaxy count correction is typically 15%, only a modest e ect. At the same magnitude limits but near the CCD center, the galaxy count correction is only < 10%. Fortunately, our nal galaxy cluster catalogs are insensitive to the application of these corrections (i.e., the same clusters are detected whether or not we apply these corrections). 


### Astrometric Calibration

A precise astrometric calibration is required to obtain accurate celestial coordinates for subsequent spectroscopic programs and to perform accurate catalog matching in order to generate V 4 I 4 colors. To perform this calibration, we rst construct a global cartesian coordinate system for each color in each survey eld by determining the relative o sets between the CCDs in the 4-Shooter as well as the o sets between adjacent scans. The global coordinate system provides the x-y position relative to the origin of the rst scan in a survey eld. The x-y o sets between the V 4 band CCDs (CCDs 1 and 4) and between the I 4 band CCDs (CCDs 2 and 3) are determined by using the photometric calibrations, or \fast" scans (see x3.2), which run perpendicular to the survey scans. The relative positions of objects on the fast scans give their true separations which, when combined with their apparent separations on CCDs 1 and 4 or CCDs 2 and 3, allow the inter-CCD o sets to be computed quite accurately. The inter-CCD o sets remain constant for any given scan but can vary from scan to scan as the 4-Shooter CCDs are periodically adjusted. O sets between adjacent survey scans are determined by using the objects in the scan overlap regions. The precise x-y o sets between overlapping frames in adjacent scans also depends on the declination (since the scans converge as one moves towards the 1950.0 pole). To account for this, the observed o sets at the start, middle, and end of the adjacent scans are measured; the o set for each overlapping pair of frames is then calculated by a linear interpolation of the measured o sets. When the o sets are determined, the global x-y position for each object is computed and stored in the catalogs. Because the o sets are all derived using 4-Shooter data directly, the angular scale per unit position in the global system is identical to the CCD image scale. Indeed, we recover the published 4-Shooter CCD scale with great accuracy when our astrometric solution is computed. Our mean best t 4-Shooter image scale (in arcseconds per pixel) is 0:33501 0:00011 (V 4 ) and 0:33503 0:00021 (I 4 ). The astrometric reference objects are obtained by selecting 50{60 unsaturated (V 4 > 17) stars per survey eld brighter than V 4 = 19. The J2000 celestial positions of these stars are then measured from the digitized \Quick V " (epoch 1983) Palomar Observatory Schmidt plates ). The stellar centroid is measured from the digitized scan using the density-weighted position and the celestial coordinates are determined using the plate solution generated during construction of the HST Guide Star Catalog V1.0 (see Russell et al. 1990 for details). An astrometric solution for each 4-Shooter survey eld is then computed using a 6-term per coordinate polynomial tting procedure, with one iteration to exclude reference stars with large (> 1 00 : 5) residuals. The typical rms deviations in the nal solution are 0 00 : 48 in right ascension and 0 00 : 36 in declination. The scatter in the astrometric solution is due to two roughly equal components | uncertainties in measuring the relative scan and CCD o sets and uncertainties in the measuring the centroids of reference stars from the digitized Schmidt plates.

### The Cluster Finding Algorithm

The detection of a rich cluster at low redshift is successfully accomplished by many di erent methods (e.g., visual, percolation, wavelets, matched lters). For statistical studies of distant clusters, though, the important properties of the algorithm are the detection rate for small amplitude uctuations (e.g., poor or distant cluster completeness), the false positive detection rate (spurious detections due to chance projections on the sky), and the accuracy with which the selection function can be determined. The latter is particularly important because the stability and accuracy of the cluster selection function are direct measures of the objectivity of a given cluster detection procedure. Our approach to cluster detection is to make use of both positional and photometric information simultaneously by using a matched lter algorithm which optimally enhances the contrast of a cluster galaxy distribution with respect to the foreground and background galaxy distributions. Since the shape of such a lter will naturally depend on the redshift of the clusters being searched for, the amplitude of the ltered signal provides a useful redshift estimate.

The matched lter method has many attractive features | 1) it is optimal for identifying weak signals in a noise dominated background (exactly the case for distant clusters), 2) photometric information is incorporated in an optimal way, 3) the contrast of overdensities which approximate the lter shape is greatly enhanced, 4) improved suppression of false detections, 5) redshift estimates are produced as a byproduct, and 6) good performance is seen over a large dynamic range in redshift. There are some disadvantages, in particular, one must assume a form for the cluster luminosity function and radial pro le. We nd that with sensible choices, however, the lters are broad enough to allow detection of systems with a range of properties.

The objective is to design a lter which preferentially suppresses galaxy uctuations which are not due to real clusters. We can derive such a lter directly from a maximum likelihood estimator by modeling the spatial and luminosity distribution of the galaxies within a cluster and then determining the likelihood L that our model ts the actual data.

We begin with the distribution of the number of galaxies per unit area per magnitude in any given patch of sky. This distribution is represented as D(r; m) = background + cluster b(m) + cl P(r=r c ) (m m ) (11) where D(r; m) is the total number of galaxies per magnitude per arcsec 2 at a given magnitude m and a given distant r from a cluster center, b(m) is the background galaxy counts (num=mag=arcsec 2 ), P(r=r c ) is the projected radial pro le of the cluster galaxies (num=arcsec 2 ), (m m ) is the di erential cluster luminosity function (num=mag), and cl is proportional to the total number of cluster galaxies and is a measure of the cluster's richness. The parameter m is the apparent magnitude corresponding to the characteristic luminosity of the cluster galaxies and r c is a characteristic cluster scale length (as seen in projection). (12)

The above equation is valid when b(m) is large enough that the Gaussian approximation holds; therefore, the statistics are dominated by the background galaxy counts and attribute all uncertainty to Poissonian noise in the background. This implies 2 = b(m). We explicitly ignore the two point galaxy-galaxy correlation function. We do not solve for b(m) but assume it a priori.

The likelihood is, thus, a function of m , r c , and cl , i.e. L = L(m ; r c ; cl ). The dependence on m and r c allows one to obtain a redshift estimate for each cluster. We choose to accomplish this by maximizing the likelihood with respect to the characteristic m . The characteristic magnitude, m , is much more sensitive to the redshift than the cluster scale, r c . Expanding the right hand side of the likelihood equation (Eq. 12), we get
ln L / Z " 2 cl P(r=r c ) (m m )D(r; m) b(m) 2 cl P(r=r c ) (m m ) # d 2 r dm Z " 2 cl P 2 (r=r c ) 2 (m m ) b(m) + C # d 2 r dm(13)
The expression for cl , determined by setting @lnL @ cl = 0, is
cl = R P(r=rc) (m m )D(r;m) b(m) d 2 r dm R P(r=r c ) (m m ) d 2 r dm R P 2 (r=r c ) 2 (m m ) b(m) d 2 r dm(14)
Inserting cl (Eq. 14) into the expression for the likelihood (Eq. 13), we nd
ln L / h R P(r=rc) (m m )D(r;m) b(m) d 2 r dm R P(r=r c ) (m m ) d 2 r dm i 2 R P 2 (r=r c ) 2 (m m ) b(m) d 2 r dm(15)
The expression in the numerator is simply the square of the excess above the background, as the background contribution is removed by the second term in Eq. 15. Since this term is a constant (if the integrals converge; see below), we could simply maximize the rst term if we needed only to maximize the numerator. The denominator is not a constant; however, it is monotonic function which is proportional to some multiple of 1=b(m ), which to a good approximation is just a power-law in the ux. Thus, maximizing the expression on the RHS of Eq. 15 is roughly equivalent to maximizing
ln L / Z P(r=r c ) (m m ) b(m) D(r; m) d 2 r dm(16)
except for a shift m in the location of the maximum which is constant if b(m) can be accurately modeled as a power-law in m. We choose to use this expression not primarily because of its simpler form but because it depends only on the shape of the background, while Eq. 15 is very sensitive to the correct normalization of the background. In practice, there are no quantitative di erences in the cluster detections (and their estimated properties) when maximizing the formal likelihood equation (Eq. 15), compared to maximizing Eq. 16. The application of the matched lter to an input galaxy catalog is accomplished by evaluating the integral in Eq. 16 at every point in the survey and over a range of m and r c values (or equivalently, over a range of redshifts). The characteristic luminosity, L , and the intrinsic cluster scale length are assumed to remain xed in physical units. The observables, m and r c , are assumed to vary with redshift as prescribed by a Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology with H = 75 km s 1 Mpc 1 and q = 0:5. The redshift dependence of m also includes a k-correction discussed in x4.2. Because the galaxy distribution is a set of discrete coordinates and uxes, one can represent D(r; m) as a series of -functions at the observed positions and magnitudes. The integral in Eq. 16 is, therefore, equivalent to the sum over all galaxies in a eld
S(i; j) = Ng X k=1 P(r k (i; j))L(m k ) Z P(r=r c ) (m m ) b(m) D(r; m) d 2 r dm(17)
The \ ltered" galaxy catalog is created by evaluating this sum for each element in a twodimensional array, S(i; j). The elements correspond to a series of grid points covering the entire survey area. The array, S(i; j), can be treated as an \image" and we shall hereafter refer to its elements as pixels. In Eq. (17), N g is the total number of galaxies in the catalog, P(r k (i; j)) is the angular weighting function (hereafter the \radial" lter), r k (i; j) is the separation between the k th galaxy and the (i; j) pixel center, m k is the magnitude of the kth galaxy, and L(m k ) is the luminosity weighting function (hereafter the ux lter). The dimensions of the array S(i; j) are dependent on both the angular size of the survey and the redshift to which the lters are tuned. The best choice of pixel size is to maintain a constant metric width that is approximately half a cluster core radius (r c ), although the results are quite similar with pixels ranging from 0.25r c to 2r c . While the above summation runs over all galaxies, in practice the radial lter will have a cuto radius and, thus, the execution time is greatly reduced for a large catalog. The optimal ux lter is (m m ) b(m) ; however, the integral of this function diverges for Schechter (1978) luminosity functions with < 1 as one sums to magnitudes fainter than m . We can correct for this and, at the same time, place most of the weight of the lter near m (where the contrast of the cluster against the background is the largest) by using the modi ed ux lter
L(m) = (m m ) b(m) (m m ) 10 0:4(m m ) b(m)(18)
Here we have introduced a power-law cuto of the dimensionless form 10 (m m ) to keep { 17 { the function integrable. We choose = 0:4 as this would represent weighing by the ux of the galaxy. We choose as the radial lter P(r=r c ) = 1 p 1+(r=rc) 2 1 p 1+(rco=rc) 2 if r < r co 0 otherwise (19) where r c is the cluster core radius and r co is an arbitrary cuto radius. The function P(r=r c ) is circularly symmetric. However, since the diameter of the lter extends well beyond a core radius, systems which are not circularly symmetric are still easily detected, albeit at a di erent signi cance level.

We choose the following normalizations for the radial and ux lters With the above normalizations, the \background level" of a ltered image is S(i; j) = S bg = 1. We expect the distribution of S(i; j) values for a given eld (and a given lter redshift) should be a roughly Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation characterized by the Poissonian error in the background distribution, a mode of 1, and a tail toward high values of S(i; j) representing signi cant cluster detections. In practice, the mode (S bg ) is not strictly 1 but varies slightly with the lter redshift because we have estimated the background counts, b(m), as the total galaxy counts in the eld (background + clusters); we have no way of separating the two components a priori. Figure 11 shows the distribution of S(i; j) values for the 0 h eld with the matched lter \tuned" to a redshift of z = 0:6.


#### E ect of the Normalization on the Redshift Estimate

The normalization of the ux lter attempts to compensate for the portion of the ux lter that extends beyond the magnitude limit of the sample. This correction is strictly appropriate for a pure background distribution b(m), as it assumes that the cluster galaxy counts are small compared to the eld galaxy counts. However, when a signi cant section of the ux lter is truncated by the survey magnitude limit, a small but correctable bias is introduced in the estimated redshifts derived from the matched lter for the most distant clusters. The redshift estimate for a cluster candidate is determined by nding the lter redshift at which the signal, S(i; j), is maximized. The bias is essentially insensitive to the { 18 { radial lter normalization and we will ignore the radial lter P(r=r c ) in the computations here. The ux lter normalization then implies the following for the data D = b + cl
S(i; j) = R m lim 0 D b dm R m lim 0 dm = R m lim 0 cl +b] b dm R m lim 0 dm = R m lim 0 cl b dm R m lim 0 dm + 1(22)
This is explicitly correct for background only ( cl = 0), as S(i; j) = S bg = 1. For real data ( cl > 0), the above normalization results in an overcorrection of the cluster signal at high lter redshifts; that is,
R m lim 0 cl b dm R m lim 0 dm > R 1 0 cl b dm R 1 0 dm (23)
This overcorrection becomes important only when a signi cant portion of the ux lter extends beyond the magnitude limit of the sample (m ! m lim ).

We can quantify the e ect by analytically calculating the cluster signal, S cl , as a function of both the lter m (or equivalently lter redshift z est ) and the cluster redshift. We calculate S cl from the expression
S cl = Z m lim 0 (m m cl ) (m m ) b(m) dm Z 1 0 P cl (r)P(r=r c )d 2 r(24)
where (m m cl ) and P cl (r) are the characteristic luminosity function and radial pro le of the input cluster. We have assumed a cluster luminosity function which has the same form and k-correction as the ux lter and a cluster radial pro le which has the same form as the radial lter (see x4.2, x4.3, and Table 3 for explicit information on the lter parameters used). P(r=r c ) and (m m ) are normalized according to Eq. (20) and (21). The dependence of S cl on lter redshift is a ected by the assumed functional form of the background galaxy distribution b(m) and the magnitude limit of the sample. Figure 12 shows S cl as a function m (the equivalent lter redshift, z est , is listed along the top axis) for the V 4 and I 4 bands. Each curve represents a cluster at a redshift from 0.2 to 1.2 in intervals of 0.1 (from top to bottom). The lter is run at each z est (or m ), and the resulting values of S cl are plotted. The survey magnitude limits are indicated by dashed lines.

For clusters at lower redshifts, S cl reaches a maximum at or close to the actual redshift and, hence, a reliable redshift estimate is obtained. However, for a cluster at z > 0:6, i.e., as m ! m lim , the maximum of S cl cannot be used to gauge the redshift of the cluster since S cl is always maximized at the highest lter redshift. This behavior is the direct result of the overcorrection of the cluster signal by the adopted ux lter normalization. When m << m lim , the problem is negligible.

We can correct for this bias by applying an appropriate, redshift{dependent cluster signal correction (CSC) to the detected cluster signal, S(i; j) S bg . We derive this correction { 19 { by making Eq. (23) into an equality, which is the case when the ux lter is not truncated by the magnitude limit, i.e.,
CSC = R m lim 0 cl b dm R m lim 0 dm , R 1 0 cl b dm R 1 0 dm (25)
The corrected signal is then S cor cl = (S(i; j) S bg ) CSC (26) The correction factor is dependent on the actual cluster redshift and the assumed luminosity function of the cluster cl (here we have assumed that the clusters have the same luminosity function and k-correction as the ux lter), but not on the cluster richness. In deriving the CSC, we have assumed that the clusters have the same luminosity function, k-correction, and radial pro le as our matched lter. The ducial redshift we have chosen for computing the CSC is z = 0:7. The CSC is well approximated by the expression (1 + z n est ) . The advantage of this approximation is strictly for computational convenience. The cluster redshift estimates do not change signi cantly if we use the full expression given in Eq. 25. The best{ t functions are CSC(V 4 ) = (1 + z 4:4 est ) 2:1 (27) CSC(I 4 ) = (1 + z 3:0 est ) 1:0 (28) Note that these corrections are only estimates to the cluster signal as they explicitly depend on the actual redshift of the cluster, its luminosity function, and its k-correction. Figure 13 shows S cl as a function m (and z est ; top axis) after application of the CSC. The signal now peaks at or near the actual redshift (up to z = 1:2) and, thus, is a better redshift estimator (see x4.2.1 for a discussion of the redshift accuracy). Nonetheless, estimated redshifts of clusters at z > 0:7 in the V 4 band and z > 1:0 in the I 4 band are still quite uncertain as the matched lter is tting only the bright end of the luminosity function.


### Cluster Detection Criteria

The algorithm is run on each of the ten galaxy catalogs ( ve survey elds in two passbands), tuned to redshifts in the range 0.2 z 1.2 in 0.1 intervals. The required inputs are lists of galaxy positions and magnitudes. At each redshift a ltered image of the galaxy catalog is produced according to the prescription in the previous section. Use of a matched lter does not remove the need to select a detection threshold. Detection is done on the ltered galaxy maps where the cluster contrast is improved. Clusters are identi ed by searching for the local maxima within a moving box which is 1.25h 1 Mpc across. We center the box on each \pixel" of the ltered galaxy map array, S(i; j). A candidate cluster is registered when the central pixel in the box is the local maximum and it lies above a prescribed threshold. The detection threshold is taken to be the 95 th percentile (approximately the 2 level).


## { 20 {

The resulting V 4 and I 4 cluster candidates are matched with each other to locate those systems which are detected in both bands. We then impose the additional criteria that the peak signal (highest valued pixel in a given detection) must exceed the 3 threshold in at least one passband, if the cluster candidate is detected in both passbands, or must exceed the 4 threshold if it is only detected in a single passband note, we use the S cor cl (Eq. 26) distribution to determine the peak signal and signi cance of all detections]. Detection in a single bandpass is often explained by the fact that the V 4 scans cover a bit more area than the I 4 scans or by the presence of a bright red or blue star which reduces the e ective I 4 or V 4 survey areas di erently. There are, none the less, some interesting cluster candidates detected in only one of the two bands. These are listed or described in Tables 4 and 5. A cluster candidate must satisfy the above criteria in at least two of the matched lter redshift intervals to be included in our main catalog. This last criterion provides additional rejection of spurious detections.

To compute the 95 th percentile detection threshold and the signi cance of the peak signal in a cluster candidate, we examine the binned distribution of the values in the ltered galaxy map array, S(i; j). The distribution is typically Gaussian with a tail toward higher values, representing the cluster detections (see Figure 11). We characterize this distribution by calculating the background level, S bg , as the mode and the dispersion around the background, bg , as 0:741 (Q 3 Q 1 ) where Q 1 and Q 3 are the rst and third quartiles, respectively. The coe cient is correct for computing the standard deviation from the interquartile range of a normal distribution. The signi cance of a given peak signal, S p , is then simply (S p S bg )= bg .

The redshift estimate for a given cluster candidate is determined by nding the lter redshift at which the peak signal is maximized (e.g., see Figure 15). The choice of the kcorrection and of the Schechter (1976) luminosity function parameters used to de ne L(m) strongly a ect the redshift estimate but have little e ect on cluster detection reliability providing extreme values are not used and that the luminosity functions of distant clusters are closely approximated by the Schechter form. We quantify this last statement in x4.3. Figure 14 shows the o set between the estimated and true redshift as a function of true redshift for 400 simulated clusters. The luminosity functions of the simulated clusters exactly match the luminosity function used to compute the ux lter function. The o set is small and is independent of the cluster redshift as long as the assumed k-correction and form of the cluster luminosity function are accurate and the CSC has been applied.


#### Redshift Estimation Accuracy

The real test of the accuracy of our redshift estimates, of course, is to compare them with the observed redshifts of real clusters in our survey. Unfortunately, there are only six clusters in the survey which have reliably determined redshifts, although they span a reasonable range in redshift, 0:3 < z obs < 0:8. Figures 15a and 15b show the o set, z est z obs , as functions of the matched lter signal (S cor cl ) and passband for these six clusters.

In all cases, the matched lter signal reaches its peak within z obs 0:2. A subregion of the ltered 13 h galaxy catalog (with the CSC applied) centered on the GHO cluster 1322+3028

(z obs = 0:70) is shown in Figure 16 at the 11 lter redshift intervals (0:2 ! 1:2) used.

The GHO cluster 1322+3027 (z obs = 0:75) also lies in this subregion. The most distant clusters appear to have estimated redshifts which are systematically lower (by 0.1 | 0.2) than their observed redshifts. Such a trend is expected if we have underestimated the amount of spectral evolution (i.e., overestimated the k-correction Once we have determined the estimated redshift of the cluster, the cluster richness is given by calculating cl at z est . From Eqs. 11 and 14 and the adopted lter normalizations (Eqs. 20 and 21), cl is given by 

where f(m) = 10 0:4m . We use S(i; j) prior to application of the CSC (the CSC is only needed for redshift estimation). The normalization of the di erential cluster luminosity function (m m ) is R (m m ) f(m) dm = L (which is exactly equivalent to Eq. 21); this normalization implies that cl is a measure of the e ective number of L galaxies in a cluster. We can easily see this by determining the total ux of the cluster (L tot ). Integrating 

{ 22 { Therefore, the cluster luminosity is L cl = cl 10 0:4m = cl L , implying that cl is the equivalent number of L galaxies in the cluster.


#### Abell Richness Measure

Since estimates of cluster richness based on parameters from the matched lter cluster algorithm, such as the peak signal or the detection area, depend on the cluster pro le and estimated redshift, we make an independent estimate of richness from the cluster galaxy counts in each of the two passbands. We follow the speci cation of Abell (1958) and calculate richness (N R ) as the number of member galaxies (above background) that are brighter than m 3 + 2 m (where m 3 is the magnitude of the third brightest galaxy) and located within a projected radius of 1:0h 1 Mpc from the cluster center. We use a radius of 1:0h 1 Mpc, rather than Abell's historical 1:5h 1 Mpc, because of the growing uncertainty in background subtraction at larger radii. Even at 1:0h 1 Mpc, it is still di cult to calculate m 3 accurately from the cluster number counts; therefore, we rst calculate the central density (N 0 ; Bahcall 1981). That is, we determine m 3 from the background subtracted galaxy counts within the smaller radius of 0:25h 1 Mpc.

For each eld, we calculate the di erential background galaxy surface density (galaxies=deg 2 =0:20 mag) by using regions which contain no detected clusters. For each cluster in the eld, we bin all galaxies within the central 0:25h 1 Mpc (at the estimated cluster redshift) in the same 0.20 magnitude bins as the background galaxies. The expected number of background galaxies in each magnitude bin is subtracted. From the nal cluster number counts, we determine the magnitude bin which contains the third brightest galaxy. The sum of all the galaxies in bins with m m 3 + 2 m is de ned as the central density of the cluster. We then perform the same procedure at a radius of 1:0h 1 Mpc, except that we x m 3 at the value determined in the central density calculation.

With the above method for estimating m 3 , we nd that there is a good correlation between N R computed within a radius of 1:0h 1 Mpc and N R computed within a radius of 1:5h 1 Mpc. Speci cally, N R (1:0)=N R (1:5) = 0:72 0:05. We use this relationship to estimate the conventional Abell richness of a distant cluster candidate in order to make some comparisons with the space density of low redshift clusters in x5. Figure 17 shows the relation between N R (1:0) and cl for both the real cluster candidates and for cluster detected using the algorithm in simulated galaxy catalogs. The correlation between the two richness parameters is signi cant at a greater than 99.2% level (using the Spearman rank correlation function), indicating that these richness measures are meaningful. The rms scatter, however, is large with sigma cl 23 for a given N R . The scatter is, in part, due to the dependence of cl on the shape of both the matched lter and the actual cluster, as well as background subtraction and redshift errors in the calculation of N R . When m 3 +2 is fainter than the survey magnitude limit, the estimated cluster richness count is highly uncertain and is often too small. Consequently, for the highest redshift clusters (indicated { 23 { by stars in Figure 17), the richness estimate N R systematically underestimated the actual cluster richness.


### The Cluster Catalog

The matched lter and cluster detection parameters used to generate the cluster catalog are listed in Table 3. These parameters were chosen because they provide a reasonable compromise between minimizing spurious detections and maximizing completeness at high redshift. We choose 100h 1 kpc and 1h 1 Mpc as the nominal values for the core radius and the cuto radius, respectively, in the de nition of the radial lter (Eq. 19). This choice was motivated by several studies on the pro les of nearby (z < 0:2) Abell clusters (e.g., Beers & Tonry 1986;Oegerle et al. 1987;Postman, Geller & Huchra 1988;Broadhurst 1995;Smail et al. 1995;Squires et al. 1995;Tyson & Fischer 1995). Quantitative descriptions of how the selection of radial lter parameters a ects catalog membership are given in x4.4.2 and x4.4.3.

A detailed analysis of the radial pro les of the distant clusters found in the present survey will be presented in paper II (Lubin & Postman 1995). Brie y, we nd that the typical surface density pro le of our cluster candidates has r c < 140h 1 kpc and a power law pro le on scales out to at least 1h 1 Mpc with slope 1:4 0:4.

The luminosity function parameters used are based on observations of low redshift clusters and eld galaxies (Kirshner et al. 1979;Lugger 1986;Postman et al. 1988;Colless 1989;Marzke et al. 1994). We assume that the shape of the luminosity function is independent of redshift and adopt a k-correction appropriate for a non-evolving elliptical galaxy (see Figures 3a and 3b). While there is evidence to suggest that the galaxy luminosity function does depend on redshift (Eales 1993;Lilly 1993;Lonsdale & Chokshi 1993), our choice to ignore this primarily a ects the accuracy of the redshift estimates (see x4.2.1) and

does not signi cantly a ect the catalog membership. This is because catalog membership is more sensitive to the shape of the ux lter than the location of its peak. The redshift estimate, on the other hand, is more sensitive to the location of the peak of the lter. Plausible changes in the shape of the cluster luminosity function with redshift result in changes in the ux lter shape which are signi cantly less than its width. For example, if we vary the slope of faint end of a Schechter luminosity function from = 0:6 to = 1:6 the FWHM of the ux lter varies by < 15% relative to the FWHM of our nominal ( = 1:1) lter (the ux lter becomes broader as we steepen the faint end slope). The peak of the ux lter shifts from 0.2 mag brighter than the peak of our nominal lter to 0.3 mag fainter than the peak of the nominal lter as we vary over the above range (the lter peaks at fainter magnitudes as we steepen the faint end slope). For comparison, the FWHM of our nominal ux lter is 1.87 mag, which is signi cantly larger than the above shift. To be sure, we ran the algorithm on the 13 h eld and varied the slope of the luminosity from 0:6 to 1:6 in 0.2 intervals. The resulting catalogs did not vary by more than 10% in size (relative to the 13 h catalog published here) and the detailed agreement is excellent (17 of the 19 13 h cluster candidates were found at all the values explored). The width of the ux lter is insensitive { 24 { to the characteristic luminosity, L , or the k-correction. The location of the peak of the ux lter, however, is quite sensitive to these parameters. If the amount of spectral evolution is underestimated (i.e., the k-correction is overestimated) then the redshift estimate will be underestimated and visa versa. For example, if z > 0:5 cluster galaxies have spectral energy distributions similar to non-evolving Sbc galaxies then using a non-evolving elliptical galaxy k-correction in the construction of the ux lter will result in z est z obs 0:1 at z obs = 0:5 and z est z obs 0:2 at z obs = 0:8. Table 4 contains the 79 cluster candidates which satisfy the detection criteria with the above matched lter parameters. For each cluster, the rst column contains a numeric ID, columns 2 and 3 contain the J2000 equatorial coordinates of the cluster (derived from the weighted average of the locations of the peak signal in the V 4 and I 4 bands for systems detected in both bands), columns 4 through 10 contain, respectively, an e ective V 4 band cluster radius in arcseconds, the V 4 band redshift estimate, the peak V 4 band cluster signal (S cor cl ), the signi cance of the peak signal, the richness estimate ( cl ) derived from the V 4 cluster signal, and two richness estimates derived from the un ltered V 4 band galaxy catalog (N o is the background subtracted galaxy count within 0.25h 1 Mpc; N R is the counts within 1.0h 1 Mpc; see x4.2.3). Columns 11 through 17 contain the same information for the I 4 band. The e ective radius is de ned as R eff = q A Det = (31) where A Det is the area of the cluster detection that lies above the 95 th percentile threshold. If a cluster is only detected in a single passband, we measure its properties in the undetected band using the position and estimated redshift derived from the actual detection. Such clusters are identi ed in Table 4 by a missing entry in the e ective radius column for the band in which the cluster was not detected. There is one cluster, #028, for which I 4 data does not exist. This cluster is a low z (z est = 0:2) system which would have been easily detected in the I 4 band.

Single band detections with peak signal < 4 , z est 0:4, and which appear to be real clusters via visual inspection of the CCD images are listed in our supplemental catalog ( Table 5). The supplemental catalog is not intended to be complete but contains 28 excellent distant cluster candidates, one of which is a known GHO cluster. The notes to Tables 4 and 5 contain details about some of the cluster candidates in the main and supplemental catalogs, including alternate identi cations when available.

Pictures of all 107 cluster candidates are displayed in Plates 1 { 6. The images are of the central 134 00 134 00 regions; north is up and west is to the right. The cluster ID is given at the top of each picture (supplemental cluster IDs are followed by the letter S). The clusters are shown in the passband in which the signi cance of the peak signal is highest. Occasionally there are narrow gaps in the images { these are just the unusable areas between 4-Shooter CCDs.

Although the PDCS elds are not all completely interior to the original Gunn & Oke (1975) survey areas, there are 27 GHO clusters that were imaged by the present CCD survey.


## { 25 {

With the adopted matched lter and cluster detection parameters, 24 of the 27 GHO clusters are detected but only 16 of these satisfy all the criteria for inclusion into the main catalog. GHO cross identi cations are given in Table 6. The 3 GHO clusters not detected at all are CL0030+0536, CL0030+0512, and CL1605+4106; they are all missed because their peak signals fall below the 95 th percentile detection threshold.


### False Positive Rate

The number of spurious clusters detected (i.e., the false positive rate) is a function of the detection threshold and the matched lter parameters. We are able, fortunately, to measure these dependencies with su cient accuracy that quantitative results can be extracted from our cluster catalogs. In the following sections, we discuss how these factors a ect cluster catalog membership.


#### Peak Threshold Dependence

To evaluate the dependence of the false positive rate on the detection threshold, we ran simulations on arti cial elds using a simple Monte-Carlo technique to reproduce, as closely as possible, the projected galaxy and magnitude distribution of the actual PDCS elds. In order to reproduce our matching criteria in the cluster detection method, we created ten pairs of background galaxy elds by simulating each eld as viewed through the V 4 and I 4 passbands. We accomplished this by rst generating a galaxy catalog in the V 4 band by using all galaxies detected in the V 4 band of one of the PDCS elds. The simulated eld is divided into a grid of square cells of 6 arcmin sides. A background galaxy population is created by distributing these galaxies, with their corresponding magnitudes, at random within each cell with the observed variation in number from cell to cell and the average count per eld. We then generate a matched simulated eld in the I 4 band by placing all the galaxies detected in the I 4 band of the PDCS eld at the positions of the galaxies in the simulated V 4 eld such that the galaxy at that position would have an appropriate color (see Figure 3b).

The cluster detection algorithm is then run on each simulated background galaxy catalog using the same matched lter parameters as in the real data (see Table 3). We x the 95 th percentile detection threshold and standard deviation ( ) at values obtained from the actual galaxy elds. That is, we examine only those spurious detections in the uniform background which would have been considered cluster detections had they been present in the actual elds. Using the same detection criteria as discussed in x4.2, these spurious detections are rst identi ed individually in V 4 and I 4 and then matched with each other to determine which are detected in both bands. The number of matched spurious detections (those detected in both passbands) as functions of peak signal threshold and radial extent (Eq. (31)) are shown in Figure 18. The histograms for the actual cluster detections are shown for comparison. There are 4.2 and 0.8 matched spurious detections deg 2 with peak signals of 3 and { 26 { 4 , respectively. The observed density of matched cluster candidates is 13.4 deg 2 and 6.8 deg 2 for peak signal thresholds of 3 and 4 , respectively. Approximately 88% of the observed cluster candidates are matched detections. This would imply false positive rates of 31% and 12% for the matched detections with peak signals 3 and 4 , respectively. The observed densities of unmatched 4 detections in the V 4 and I 4 passbands are 1.1 deg 2 and 0.6 deg 2 , respectively. In the simulations, we nd the densities of unmatched 4 detections in the V 4 and I 4 passbands are 0.7 deg 2 and 0.4 deg 2 , respectively. This would imply a very high false positive rate for the unmatched detections (about 65%). Figure 18 demonstrates, however, that the actual detections are typically larger than the spurious ones. If one restricts the radial extent to be at least 200 arcseconds, the false positive rates drop to 15% and 9% for matched detections with peak signals 3 and 4 , respectively.

We can use the Abell richness estimates (N R ) of our cluster candidates to check these estimated spurious detection rates. We do this by computing the percentage of clusters with richnesses which are within two standard deviations of zero (i.e. consistent with being simply background). If such clusters are all false positive detections then we nd spurious detection rates of 20% for 3 matched detections, 9% for 4 matched detections, and 22% for 4 single band detections. These rates are in good agreement with our estimates of the false positive rates in the simulated eld galaxy distributions discussed above.

If the peak threshold is lowered below the 3 level, the number of detections increases signi cantly: the detection rate is about 50% higher if a 2.5 peak threshold is used. However, many of the additional detections are either superpositions of eld galaxies or very poor systems. There are inevitably richer but quite distant clusters which fall below the 3 threshold. Some are listed in the supplemental catalog (Table 5). Because the false positive rate at the 2.5 peak threshold is comparable with the probable number of real detections, we have adopted the more reasonable 3 peak threshold. In any case, the advantage of an objective detection algorithm is that a selection function can be accurately quanti ed and we do so in x4.7.1.


#### Core Radius Dependence

To quantify the dependence of the catalog size on the core radius used in the radial lter, we ran the cluster nding algorithm on the 0 h eld using three di erent core radii: 100h 1 kpc (the nominal value), 33h 1 kpc (3 times smaller), and 300h 1 kpc (3 times larger). These tests were done with the cuto radius held constant at 1h 1 Mpc. All the candidates found when we use a radial lter with a 300h 1 kpc core radius are also found when the 100h 1 kpc core radius lter is used. Conversely, only 70% of the candidates found with the 100h 1 kpc core radius are found with the 300h 1 kpc core radius lter. Some of the candidates missed with the larger core radius lter are among our most distant cluster candidates. The number of cluster candidates found when we use a radial lter with a 33h 1 kpc core radius is twice the number found when a 100h 1 kpc core radius is used. As one lowers the core radius scale, one picks up smaller systems and consequently the spurious detection rate also { 27 { increases. Some of the smaller systems detected are poor groups of galaxies. The rest are almost certainly superpositions of eld galaxies that are not physical associations. None of the systems detected with the 33h 1 kpc core radius lter but missed at larger radii are rich clusters. Simulations reveal as the adopted core radius is decreased the false positive rate increases, reaching nearly twice the rates quoted in the previous section when r c = 33h 1 kpc. Conversely, the false positive rate declines to about 65% the rates quoted in the previous section when r c = 300h 1 kpc but then so does the detection probability of compact systems and very distant systems. The selection of a 100h 1 kpc core radius thus appears to be appropriate for reliable identi cation of clusters out to z 1.


#### Cuto Radius Dependence

The catalog size also depends on the cuto radius of the radial lter. We have explored a range of cuto radii from 700h 1 kpc to 3h 1 Mpc (with the core radius held constant at 100h 1 kpc). The signi cance of a detection, on average, gradually decreases as one increases the cuto radius from 0.7h 1 Mpc to 3h 1 Mpc, dropping by 20 40% over this range. The dependence of the detection signi cance on cuto radius is less well de ned, however, in the range 700h 1 kpc < r co < 1h 1 Mpc. A cuto radius of 1h 1 Mpc appears to be about optimal and is indeed what we have chosen. The most robust catalog members are obviously the 4 detections. Their inclusion in the nal catalog is insensitive to the cuto radius in the range explored here. The dependence of detection signi cance on the cuto radius is understood. As one increases the cuto radius, more weight is given to galaxies at larger radii and less to galaxies near the cluster center (a consequence of the radial lter normalization given in Eq. 20). If the cluster dimensions are signi cantly smaller than the cuto radius then the matched lter signal will be reduced because of the increased contribution from interlopers at large radii. If the cluster dimensions are signi cantly larger than the cuto radius, the signal may be truncated but this depends on the precise shape of the cluster pro le (clusters with steeper pro les than the radial lter are not as signi cantly a ected).


#### Cluster Deblending

About 5% of the cluster candidates have a neighboring cluster candidate that lies within a projected separation of 2h 1 Mpc and that has an estimated redshift that di ers by 0:2. While it is possible (although unlikely) for clusters to be so close, an alternative explanation is that substructures within a cluster were detected as separate systems. For reference, fewer than 3% of the R 0 Abell clusters in the volume limited sample produced by Lauer & Postman (1994) have projected separations less than 2h 1 Mpc. In the notes to Tables 4 and 5 we attempt to identify possible related systems. We have not explicitly removed such systems because it is possible that they really are separate clusters (visual inspection was inconclusive). Follow-up spectroscopic observations will eventually resolve such cases. In any case, the e ect is signi cantly smaller than the estimated spurious detection rate.


### False Negative Rate

Real clusters that are not detected fall into two categories. First are those clusters or groups which fail to satisfy either the 95 th percentile detection threshold or the peak signal threshold because they are either very poor systems or extremely distant systems. It is inevitable that we will miss such systems. Fortunately, we are able to precisely quantify this selection bias. Second are those clusters which fall below the detection thresholds because they exhibit very at pro les. If such systems exist, they may be missed because their shape is not well matched to the shape of the radial lter. Poor clusters with very \cuspy" pro les (core radii < 30h 1 kpc) might also be missed as they will be signi cantly smoothed, although no presently observed clusters have such narrow pro les. An accurate determination of the cluster selection function is essential, therefore, not only for understanding the completeness of our survey but for interpreting the observed cluster abundances in the context of competing cluster formation models (e.g., Frenk et al. 1990).


#### The Selection Function

The probability that a cluster will be included in the sample depends on its redshift, richness, pro le, the evolutionary history of its galaxies, and the observation passband. In order to derive the selection function which describes all these dependencies, we rst need to establish the relationship between the matched lter signal and these quantities. To do this accurately, we simulated a total of 10560 clusters at di erent redshifts (0:2 z 1:2), richnesses (Abell R=1 4), projected radial pro les (from at to r 2 ), passbands (V 4 and I 4 ), and assumed two di erent k-corrections: one appropriate for a non-evolving elliptical galaxy and one appropriate for a non-evolving Sbc galaxy (see Figures 3a and 3b). The simulated clusters all have Schechter luminosity functions with faint end slopes that are identical to that used in the construction of the ux lter (i.e., = 1:1). Each simulated cluster was then added into each real galaxy catalog and the cluster detection algorithm was run. This allows us to directly compute the matched lter signal and detection frequency as functions of redshift, richness, pro le slope, k-correction, and passband. Figure 19 shows the matched lter richness, cl , as a function of redshift, richness, kcorrection, and passband for simulated clusters with r 1:4 pro les (which is the average pro le slope of the actual cluster candidates). The matched lter parameters used are identical to those listed in Table 3. This is an important calibration since the peak signal and cl are not related to the cluster galaxy overdensity in a simple way. The observed cl values of all the cluster candidates (including the supplemental clusters) are plotted for comparison, along with the typical detection threshold level. The richness of detected clusters tends to increase with redshift but as Figure 19 demonstrates the precise trend depends on the degree of spectral evolution of the cluster galaxies.

We also use our simulations to quantify the e ect of mismatch between the cluster pro le and the radial lter. The range of cluster pro les used in the simulations (r 0 to r 2 ) bracket { 29 { the range of pro les typically seen in Abell clusters. It was found that, as expected, the r 2 clusters yield the strongest signal and the at (r 0 ) clusters yield the weakest signal. The relative matched lter signal ratios for r 0 ; r 1 , and r 2 clusters of a given richness class are 0.20 : 1 : 2.85. These ratios are independent of richness class and redshift. The uncertainties in these ratios are about 10%. In other words, a richness class 1 cluster with a at pro le (if such a system exists) would yield a peak signal that is about 14 times smaller than that for a richness class 1 cluster with a r 2 pro le at the same redshift.

The cluster selection function is computed by simply counting the number of simulated clusters that are detected as a function of redshift, richness, pro le, k-correction, and the observation passband. The selection functions for clusters with r 1:4 pro les are shown in Figure 20. The trends are well understood. Obviously, the richer clusters are detected more frequently than poorer ones at high redshift. Likewise, clusters with the Sbc k-correction are more easily detected at high redshift than those with the E-galaxy k-correction. Distant clusters are also more easily detected in the I 4 band. The selection functions for clusters with at or r 2 pro les are qualitatively similar but, of course, di er quantitatively.


#### Merged Clusters

A standard problem with any two-dimensional or quasi two-dimensional cluster detection algorithm is separating 2 or more superposed clusters at di erent redshifts. Our simulations have shown that in only 10% of the cases where two clusters had a projected separation of 1.25h 1 Mpc or less, did the algorithm successfully detect both systems. This is largely a consequence of the 1.25h 1 Mpc detection box used to locate local maxima in the ltered galaxy maps. All clusters with projected separations greater than 1.25h 1 Mpc are resolved. By selecting a smaller detection box one will resolve ner scale structures but at the cost of introducing many more multiply detected clusters (see x4.4.4). Indeed, if we reduce the size of the detection box by 50% the number of multiply detected clusters increases almost tenfold. The frequency of occurance of superposed systems is a function of the spatial distribution of distant clusters. Since this is not yet known, it is di cult to estimate how many systems are missed or have richness overestimated because of this e ect. Spectroscopic follow-up surveys of these systems are required to de nitively answer this question.


## DISCUSSION

One of the prime motivations for conducting this survey is to constrain the comoving density of clusters as a function of redshift. This will be accurately accomplished only when redshifts exist for a substantial number of these distant clusters. At the present time we have spectroscopic redshifts for only a handful and, thus, we present preliminary constraints based upon our estimated redshift data.


## { 30 {

In Figure 21 we plot the cumulative number of clusters per square degree as a function of redshift and richness ( cl and N R (1:0h 1 Mpc)) for the PDCS. The N(< z) for the GHO catalog, the Abell/ACO catalog, the APM cluster catalog (Dalton et al. 1992), and the Edinburgh-Durham-Milano (EDM) cluster redshift catalog ) are also shown. The Abell cluster curves are extrapolations normalized to the z 0:07, R 0 Abell cluster space density and assume this density remains constant in comoving coordinates. For reference, a richness class 1 cluster should have 35 N R < 56. If the same cluster has z < 0:7 and a r 1:4 pro le, then it would have 25 < cl < 60 in the V 4 band and 30 < cl < 65 in the I 4 band (see Figure 19). No corrections have been made for false positive detections in Figure 21. Figure 22 shows the observed and expected di erential redshift histograms for the clusters in our main catalog with richness class 1. Figure 23 shows the cumulative histograms. The observed histograms are based solely on our estimated redshifts and we have corrected the counts for false positive detections using the rates estimated from simulations (see x4.4.1). The expected distributions, for a given passband, are computed from the expression N exp (z; k(z)) = V (z) 4 X i=0 ( i (z)P i (z; k(z))) (32) where N exp (z; k(z)) is the expected number of clusters per square degree per unit redshift for an assumed k-correction model speci ed by k(z), V (z) is the volume of a comoving element from z to z + z subtending a 1 square degree solid angle, i (z) is the space density of clusters in this volume with richness class i, and P i (z; k(z)) is the probability that a cluster of richness class i at redshift z would be detected by our cluster selection procedure for a given passband. Since the selection probability is a function of projected cluster pro le, we need to assume something about the pro les of clusters in order to make our prediction. The projected pro le of a typical z 0:2 cluster is at least as steep as r 1 but atter than r 2 over the range 100 < r < 1000h 1 kpc (Beers & Tonry 1986;Oegerle et al. 1987;Postman, Geller & Huchra 1988;Broadhurst 1995;Lubin & Postman 1995;Smail et al. 1995;Squires et al. 1995;Tyson & Fischer 1995). For this computation, we adopt the selection function for a r 1:4 pro le | the mean pro le shape for the clusters in this catalog. Lastly, we assume a constant comoving density of clusters and a constant cluster mass function (i.e., the relative abundances of clusters of di erent richness classes remains independent of redshift). The actual density of the various richness classes is derived from the cluster luminosity function given by Bahcall (1979), normalized to match the observed space density of low redshift clusters. We compute the predicted cluster counts for two di erent galaxy population scenarios { one where clusters are made up of nonevolving elliptical galaxies and one where clusters are made up of nonevolving Sbc galaxies (see Figure 3). The di erent scenarios account for the two substantially di erent expectations as a function of redshift and passband seen the Figures 22 and 23, although in the I 4 band cosmological e ects are comparable with the e ect of varying the k-correction. The estimated redshift distribution of the Palomar survey clusters is consistent with the hypothesis that the typical distant cluster galaxy is bluer than a nonevolving elliptical galaxy at the cluster redshift.


## { 31 {

The predicted cluster counts depend critically on which data are used to determine the low redshift normalization. If we normalize to the observed space density of R 1 Abell clusters, we nd that the expected number of such clusters with z 0:3 per square degree is about a factor of 5 ( 2) smaller than the number in our Palomar catalog even after applying a statistical correction for spurious detections. This \discrepancy" is clearly demonstrated in Figure 21 | PDCS clusters with N R 35 or with cl > 40 should correspond to Abell richness class 1 systems. The PDCS certainly has better completeness for poor clusters than either the Abell or GHO catalogs although assessing the exact incompleteness of these catalog is di cult given the visual selection procedures used in their construction. The space density of clusters in the PDCS is consistent with that previously found by GHO; however, a direct comparison is not very meaningful since there is no richness information for the GHO clusters and the GHO cluster selection function cannot be easily quanti ed. Extrapolating the density of z < 0:1, R 1 Abell clusters to z 0:3 results in a substantial underestimate of the cluster space density inferred from the present survey. The uncertainty in the density of z 0:3 clusters from the PDCS is large but improves signi cantly by z = 0:6 where R 1 PDCS clusters still outnumber the predicted R 1 Abell/ACO cluster density by a factor of 5 (after false positive correction). Hence, the expected counts shown in Figures 22  and 23 are based on a comoving density of R 1 clusters that is 5 times larger than that derived from the Abell and ACO catalogs. Our assumed Abell cluster space densities are 1:13 10 5 h 3 Mpc 3 , 4:04 10 6 h 3 Mpc 3 , 1:28 10 6 h 3 Mpc 3 , and 2:74 10 7 h 3 Mpc 3 for richness classes 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These densities are derived from Bahcall (1979) but are in good agreement with subsequent Abell cluster redshift surveys (Huchra et al. 1990;Postman et al. 1992;Lauer & Postman 1994) and southern hemisphere redshift surveys of systems comparable to R 0 Abell clusters (Dalton et al. 1992;Nichol et al. 1992).

At z 0:6, the slope of the PDCS N(< z) vs z relation is consistent with a constant comoving density, albeit a density 5 times higher than the R 1 Abell cluster density. The attening of the slope of the N(< z) vs z relation at z > 0:6 is primarily due to the PDCS selection function (as demonstrated by Figure 23). Figure 22 shows that a signi cant constraint on the spectral evolution of cluster galaxies is the modal redshift of the cluster sample | for clusters dominated by non-evolving elliptical galaxies, the predicted mode of the PDCS cluster redshift distribution is between 0:3 0:45 whereas for clusters dominated by evolving elliptical galaxies (or non-evolving Sbc galaxies), the predicted mode may be as high as 0.75. The uncertainties in the redshift estimates, however, prevent us from constraining the cluster space density at z 1. Follow-up spectroscopic surveys should allow a reasonable determination of the behavior of the space density of clusters at z > 0:6. Postman et al. (1995) have completed a contiguous 13 square degree I band survey which is approximately 1.5 mag deeper than the PDCS in an additional e ort to address this issue.

There are several possible explanations for the di erence between the abundances of Abell and PDCS clusters. The Abell catalog could easily be missing half the clusters (presumably mostly R 1). The objectively derived APM and EDM cluster catalogs yield a somewhat higher space density of clusters than that derived from the Abell catalog when cut at comparable richnesses although it is not inconsistent with the Abell value. However, nearly 60% of the EDM clusters with m 10 18:5 are not detected in the ACO catalog. This is true at all richness cuts . Henry et al. (1992) produced an x-ray selected cluster sample to study cluster evolution. At z 0:08, they detect 7 clusters but only 3 of these are in the Abell catalog. The 4 x-ray selected clusters not in the Abell catalog have x-ray luminosities that are comparable with the ones that are. X-ray luminosity is highly correlated with richness and central density (Edge & Stewart 1991).

Previous observations have shown that clusters at z 0:4 have galaxy populations which are signi cantly bluer than their low redshift counterparts (Butcher & Oemler 1984;Oemler 1992). At higher redshifts, Arag on-Salamanca et al. (1993) report that \...by z 0:9 there are no cluster galaxies as red as present day ellipticals." Such evolution would enhance the detection rate of high redshift clusters at a given threshold (particularly in the V 4 band). Recent HST image data Couch et al. 1994;Ellis 1994) reveal that many of the blue (g r < 1:2) galaxies in z < 0:5 clusters are either \normal" spirals or have peculiar morphologies, producing non-elliptical fractions which are 3 to 5 times higher than the average current epoch cluster. A number of physical mechanisms have clearly reprocessed the morphological mix between epochs. The dense regions of clusters do provide unique sites where processes like ram-pressure stripping and galaxy-galaxy collisions can, in principle, become e cient means of altering the properties of a signi cant fraction of the galaxy distribution. One explanation could be spiral destruction (Dressler 1980;Postman & Geller 1984;Whitmore, Gilmore, & Jones 1993), although observations at redshifts approaching unity suggest that the fraction of excessively blue galaxies may jump to as high as 80% (Rakos & Schombert 1995). Fading through cessation of star formation may also play a role, but studies at low redshift indicate that this process alone cannot dominate the evolution of blue and/or spiral galaxies. Gunn & Dressler (1988) nd that the spectra of cluster galaxies with z > 0:6 show, on average, smaller 4000 A decrements and a higher frequency of poststarburst features (the \E+A" spectral class) than those at z < 0:6. It is likely that in the cluster environment a combination of starbursts, tidal destruction, fading, and stripping conspire to produce the observed time variation of photometric and spectroscopic properties.

Some optically selected high redshift \clusters" may be larger scale structures (e.g., \Great Wall"-like features) viewed at orientations that make them mimic clusters. Contamination by large scale structures would increase both the number of detections and the blue galaxy component (sheets of galaxies at low z are composed largely of nonelliptical galaxies). Only an \edge-on" sheet would potentially be detected as cluster candidate since the galaxy surface density in a face-on sheet is too low (de Lapparent et al. 1986(de Lapparent et al. , 1989. If the fraction of sheets with near \edge-on" orientation is independent of direction or redshift then the probability of viewing a sheet of galaxies along its narrow dimension is just proportional to the volume of space surveyed. Hence, deep optical cluster surveys may be more contaminated by such structures than low z cluster surveys. Lefevre et al. (1994) spectroscopically veri ed the existence of a galaxy structure of intermediate scale ( 2 3h 1 Mpc) at z = 0:985.

Our estimated spurious detection rate due to alignments of eld galaxies is < 30% (x4.4.1), and we are con dent that eld galaxy superposition is not the primary source of the factor of 5 discrepancy in cluster counts. Couch et al. (1991) claim that the higher cluster density in their J band survey could, in part, be explained by foreground contamination from spiral rich groups. However, 88% of our clusters are detected in both the V 4 and I 4 passbands which argues against severe contamination from such groups. A related e ect, which is probably important for our survey, is an enhanced detection rate due to the superposition of poor groups and/or clusters. Systems with redshifts that di er by z < 0:2 and with projected separations of < 1h 1 Mpc would be detected as a single cluster with richness signi cantly higher than any of the individual superposed components. The Abell catalog contains a number of such cases (e.g., A419, A1318, A1631). Spectroscopic follow-up is the only unambiguous way to measure the magnitude of this problem. We note, however, that the matched lter algorithm is able to resolve overlapping systems if the projected separation is > 1:25h 1 Mpc.

Finally, we address the question of how our measuring errors might contribute to this discrepancy. The space density of clusters in the Abell catalog is roughly exponential with Abell's richness parameter. If f is the fraction of clusters at (or above) some richness R, d ln f=dR 1:1; that is, the space density of clusters falls by a factor of 3 for each successive richness class. The richness class is roughly logarithmic with total galaxy population (which is proportional to cl ), i.e. d ln cl =dR 0:45. Therefore, the fraction of clusters above a given value of cl goes as a power law function of cl . f / 2:4 cl (33) Thus, if we have overestimated the richnesses of all our clusters by a factor of 2, the discrepancy can be explained. We have examined this possibility through extensive simulations of clusters with a broad range of pro le shapes and color evolution (Lubin 1995). Firstly, we examine the relation between the actual richness and N R . For most of the very distant clusters, we severely underestimate their richness; however, for some of the nearby clusters (z est 0:4), we can misclassify R = 0 clusters as R = 1 clusters and vice versa due to uncertainties in background subtraction and redshift errors. In the worse case, these misclassi cations could cause a factor of 2 overestimate in the space density of clusters at z 0:4. Secondly, we have examined the e ect of the pro le shape on the lter richness parameter cl . The magnitude of cl is proportional to the steepness of the cluster pro le. Complete resolution of the discrepancy would require Abell R 1 clusters to have cl 85 and cl 70 in the V 4 and I 4 bands, respectively. These values would correspond to an average cluster surface density pro le of r 2 or steeper. This pro le is not consistent with the PDCS clusters. The average pro le shape is r 1:4 (Lubin & Postman 1995). Lastly, we have examined the e ect of the shape of the cluster luminosity function on the relation between cl and the Abell richness estimator. The relationship depends on the faint end slope, , but not on the k-correction. For values in the range 0:6 1:3, the relationship varies by only 30%. The trend is such that if the cluster LF slope is greater (less) than the nominal ux lter value, a R = 1 cluster would yield a lower (higher) cl value.

A more subtle question is the e ect of systematic or random redshift errors. One might naively think that the error could be explained by a relatively small systematic underestimate of redshift as the volume, and hence the number, increases dramatically with distance. In the Euclidean case, d ln V=d ln z = 3:0 (where V is the comoving volume), so a factor of ve in space density would require a systematic underestimate of the distance by a factor of 0.6. At a redshift of 0.5 in an = 1 Einstein-deSitter universe, the value of d ln V=d ln z is smaller, about 2.2; to explain the discrepancy, we would have to underestimate the distances by slightly more than a factor of 2. This seems hardly possible; however, the situation may be more complex as our estimate of richness is also distance-dependent. If we underestimate the distance, we may underestimate the richness as we have assumed a brighter characteristic m . The richness measured relative to this m would be smaller than that measured relative to the actual, fainter m . The result is that we would confuse very rich clusters at great distance, of which there are few, with poorer ones nearby. We can estimate the magnitude of the e ect as follows. From the simulations, we nd that in the vicinity of the correct redshift, the inferred richness changes with the assumed redshift like d ln cl =d ln z a 2:1. Now let us focus on some assumed redshift z a and richness a cl and suppose that the clusters that we think are at that redshift are really at some other (say larger) redshift z t . Let us then ask how the total measured number of clusters at z < z a and cl > a cl changes as the real redshift z t changes. The number of clusters that we infer to be in our sample as we change z t is the product of the total number of clusters, which we assume is proportional to the comoving volume, and the fraction of clusters at z t which are su ciently rich to have measured richness a cl at the inferred redshift z a . This richness e ect is opposite in sign to the volume e ect and more than cancels the former; the numbers change with almost the inverse third power of the redshift. We need to have overestimated the redshift by a factor of about 1.8 to explain the discrepancy. This is extremely unlikely. The validity of this richness correction calculation depends on the origin of the redshift errors. As we have discussed in Sect. 4.3 and above, any systematic redshift error is most likely due to our assumption of no evolution, rather than the choice of an inappropriate luminosity function. First, there is no evidence of gross variations in the luminosity function among clusters; second, our simulations, which are all based on a single Schechter luminosity function, display errors similar to the real sample and no substantial redshift biases. Therefore, we see no evidence to suggest that there are large luminosity function variations which would invalidate the notion of \richness" as measured by either the matched lter ( cl ) or the Abell technique (N R ) and the calculation for the richness correction (Eq. 34).


## { 35 {

Let us now consider the (\Malmquist") bias due to random errors. As long as the number{distance relation is concave up (which is the case for both the richness-uncorrected and the richness-corrected relation in Eq. 34), the e ect of random errors in the distances is to cause one to overestimate the galaxy density in a cluster. If the distribution of errors in ln z is assumed to be Gaussian with standard deviation , the density overestimate is the factor F = inferred cl true cl = exp (   2 2 2 )

Here = d ln N=d ln z 2:8, so the factor is approximately F = exp(3:9 2 ), which is 5 for 0:64 and 2 for 0:42. At our mean cluster redshift of 0:6, the former corresponds to a mean redshift error of 0:4, the latter to an error of 0:25. We believe the errors in our estimated redshifts to be 0:2 (see section 4.2.1). Therefore, perhaps one-half of the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Malmquist e ect, and it seems likely that evolution and incompleteness in the Abell sample can account for the rest. However, we must wait for a substantial number of real redshifts for this sample before it is possible to clarify this issue satisfactorily. We have already begun a number of related spectroscopic surveys. Such programs are time consuming and one goal of publishing this catalog is to provide the community with a starting point for further exploration. Over the next ve years, results from these and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys plus imaging with HST and x-ray satellites should yield a substantial improvement in our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters.
