Background: Localized scleroderma, known as morphea, is a connective tissue disorder characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the skin and the soft tissue. There exist no universally accepted validated outcome measures in order to monitor the disease activity. Besides clinical scores to evaluate outcome measures, imaging modalities are increasingly utilized in assessing patients with morphea, such as high-frequency ultrasonography (US), shear-wave elastography (SWE), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the accuracy of these imaging modalities in monitoring morphea activity is not yet clear.Aims:To review the literature regarding the role of imaging modalities in assessing patients with morphea.Materials & Methods:In this study, we searched the PubMed/Medline database for articles published from inception until February 2023.Results:A total number of 23 original articles in three categories of US, elastography, and MRI were included.Discussion:Regarding US, criteria, including increased dermal thickness, increased echogenicity of the subcutaneous tissue, and decreased dermal echogenicity, were indicators of active morphea lesions when using high frequencies probe (18)(19)(20)color Doppler sonography. Moreover, studies evaluating SWE, a novel method to quantitatively assess tissue stiffness, demonstrated increased dermal stiffness in active lesions.Conclusion: Studies showed that MRI can help to determine the depth of disease, particularly as a first-line and follow-up diagnostic tool, especially in generalized and deep morphea. In addition, brain MRI may be useful for patients with localized craniofacial scleroderma experiencing new or worsening neurological symptoms.K E Y W O R D Selastography, localized scleroderma, morphea, MRI, sonographyThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

# INTRODUCTION

Localized scleroderma (LoS), also known as morphea, is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the skin as well as the soft tissue that causes the imbalance of collagen production and destruction. [1][2][3][4] Although the exact pathogenesis of morphea remains unclear, it is believed that genetic predisposition, immune system dysregulation, trauma, and iatrogenic factors might be responsible for causing the disease. 1,2 Morphea, which is seen in all age ranges, is divided into four major subtypes: plaque type (circumscribed), linear, generalized, and mixed.

Notably, plaque type and linear morphea are the most common types and main focus of most studies. 2 The clinical presentation of morphea differs according to its subtype, degree of involvement, and stage In addition, computerized surface area measurement is insensitive to improvement. Moreover, durometer has poor correlation with clinical skin scores, and its sensitivity to change is unknown. Cutometer has not been validated in morphea, and thermography is incapable of distinguishing between active and inactive phases. 4 Some imaging modalities are utilized in assessing patients with morphea, such as high-frequency ultrasonography (US), shear-wave elastography (SWE), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These imaging modalities are promising tools in the diagnosis and monitoring of morphea lesions. Furthermore, they seem to be more reliable and quantitative than other currently applied methods. However, there is no consensus on the definite monitoring criteria for morphea yet. 3,4 The aim of this study was to review the literature on the role of imaging modalities in assessing patients with morphea in terms of disease activity, discriminating between different phases, and response to the treatment.


# METHODS AND MATERIALS

In this study, we searched the PubMed/Medline database for articles published from inception until February 2023 using the related keywords. Our search terms were "LoS," "morphea," "imaging," "US," "Elastography," and "MRI." Out of the 439 retrieved articles, 23 original studies were included in our study.


# RESULTS

A total number of 23 original articles were enrolled in our study. In this study, we categorized our findings into three sections, and we reviewed the role of US, elastography, and MRI in morphea assessment. The characteristics of the included studies are described in Table 1.


## Ultrasonography

Ultrasound imaging is a noninvasive and objective method for evaluating morphea. The combination of US and Doppler imaging allows for the evaluation of both superficial and deep soft tissue thicknesses, echogenicity as well as subcutaneous vascularity of skin lesions in LoS.

By using high-frequency ultrasound, quantitative assessments with higher resolutions can be performed. [5][6][7] The study done by Serup   sample sizes, lack of sufficient follow-up study by US and using A-mode (amplitude mode) scan in some studies which give one dimension plotted images in compared to 2D images in the B-mode (brightness mode) scan which have higher resolution and simple to interpreted (Table 1).

In our institution as a referral dermatologic center, we use both gray scale and color Doppler B-mode ultrasound performed with Aixplorer 


## Elastography

Elastography is a novel method to quantitatively assess tissue stiffness and is performed in two ways: strain elastography (SE) and did not analyze different stages of the disease and also did not explore the association between skin stiffness and pathologic findings. 21 All of the abovementioned studies are cross-sectional and did not follow skin stiffness by SWE ultrasound after treatment. We conducted a cohort study of morphea patients and experimentally use shear-wave elastography performed with Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine) using 20 MHz probe and calculate dermal and hypodermal elasticity by using copious amount of gel and minimal hand pressure and report tissue stiffness average of three measurements express in kPa for normal and abnormal dermis and hypodermis at baseline and then follow them in 3 and 6 months interval after treatment ( Figure 2). Data will be published soon.


## Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI has been shown to be a valuable diagnostic tool for detecting and monitoring musculoskeletal involvement in morphea patients given its excellent soft-tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation. The results of a previous study on MRI findings of 43 patients with LoS excluded the superficial subtype which is confined to the epidermis and dermis detected musculoskeletal involvement in 74% of patients.

MRI detected musculoskeletal involvements in 96% of the clinically suspected patients and in 38% of not clinically suspected patients.

They found "fascial thickening" as the most common musculoskeletal MRI finding (60%). Moreover, increased fascial enhancement, articular synovitis, tenosynovitis, and subcutaneous septal thickening were the most prevalent findings. Moreover, they found that all pansclerotic morphea patients had articular synovitis. 25 In a recent study, MRIs of the extremities in 14 children with juvenile localized scleroderma were evaluated. Deep tissue involvement was detected in 65% of them. Fascial thickening and fascial enhancement were the most common findings of deep tissue involvement.

Besides, infiltration and atrophy of the subcutaneous fat were the most prevalent subcutaneous finding. Moreover, muscle and bone marrow edema were seen in 40% and 20% of the images, respectively. In six patients, subsequent imaging after treatment was done in 2-5 years of follow-up, showed improvement but not necessarily resolution of the superficial and deep involvement. They concluded that axial T1, axial fluid-sensitive, and axial T1-FS contrast-enhanced sequences should be included in the imaging protocol, and the findings that were detected in contrast-enhanced sequences were also seen in fluid-sensitive sequences, meaning that intravenous contrast is not necessary for these examinations. 26 In this regard, in a study performed by Schanz  indicating that the pathology extends beyond clinical margins. 28 In Shahidi et al. study, 33 patients with morphea were given methotrexate and pulses of methylprednisolone. They mentioned that cutaneous fat enhancement was the most prevalent finding in MRI.

Then, the effectiveness of the treatment was examined by MRI. They concluded that the clinical markers of mLoSSI and LoSDI except for skin thickness and new lesion extension were in association with MRI scores before and after the therapy. However, they did not explain other MRI findings or MRI scoring in detail. 29 Liu et al. evaluated 23 patients with morphea mainly linear type and revealed positive findings in half of the patients. They reported leg length discrepancy, muscle atrophy, bone remodeling deformity, abnormal bone marrow signals, and joint contracture as the main peripheral findings. They also reported intracranial calcifications and white matter abnormalities. They also found central nervous system abnormalities in 3 patients with "en coup de sabre" deformity that were neurologically asymptomatic. 30 Furthermore, neuroimaging manifestations of localized craniofa- 


# CONCLUSION

One of the most challenging issues in treating morphea patients is the lack of globally accepted assessment tools for monitoring the results of treatment and disease activity. [33][34][35][36] In this regard, ultrasound is a potential and reliable imaging modality in the quantitative morphea assessment. However, ultrasound has limitations such as being operator dependent and lack of consistent intra or interoperator measurement of tissue thickness. It should be considered that there are discrepancies in available literature because of different cross-sectional study designs, using A-mode scan and various probe frequencies, and small sample sizes. To establish a quantitative, valid, and reproducible outcome measure, larger prospective cohort studies using higher probe frequencies should be conducted. In addition, shear-wave elastography can be used for disease monitoring and assessing therapeutic effects. SWE is a novel tool that is not universally available and it is not FDA approved for skin so far. To determine the role of SWE in detecting lesion progression and changes overtime, future studies are needed.

MRI provides complementary information about the depth of the disease especially in deep or generalized morphea (GM) as well as neurologic manifestations of localized craniofacial scleroderma. MRI has also limitations, including being expensive, time-consuming, infeasible in routine clinical settings, and a low signal-to-noise ratio for superficial layers intrinsically.

In conclusion, we recommend color Doppler ultrasound with high frequencies probe (18-20 MHz) and if available, SWE for assessing and monitoring superficial soft tissue involvement. In GM or DM, MRI helps to determine the depth of disease, particularly as a first-line and followup diagnostic tool. In addition, brain MRI may be useful for patients


of evolution. Active morphea lesions are characterized by erythema and induration and of note, most lesions of morphea have an insidious course and are asymptomatic. Inactive lesions show sclerosis and atrophy of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissues. 2 Due to the long-lasting cutaneous and extra-cutaneous manifestations of morphea, patients may experience serious aesthetic problems, tissue atrophy, functional disabilities, as well as muscular and neurological complications. Hence, early diagnosis of the active disease, staging, and response to the treatment is very important. 1 Unfortunately, there exist no universally accepted validated outcome measures in order to monitor the disease activity. 4 Disease activity in morphea is usually assessed by clinical evaluation, and biopsy is performed to diagnose the disease at base line. There exist some methods to evaluate outcome measures. Nevertheless, each of them has some limitations. For instance, some skin scores, such as the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS), have not been validated for morphea.

## Using a 13
13MHz probe, the morphological evaluation of 40 morphea lesions revealed a characteristic dense image at the dermalhypodermal junction resembling a "flattened yo-yo" with an acute angle at lateral limits similar to a "V." This "yo-yo" image is detected regardless of the duration of the plaque and can last for many years.There was a 92% sensitivity and a 100% specificity for LoS diagnosis when four of these five signs were present: undulations of the dermis,disorganization, loss of thickness and thickened hyperechoic bands in the hypodermis, and the yo-yo image. 13 According to the Arisi et al.'s study using 50 MHz ultrasound on 17 lesions, there is a reduction in dermal density as well as an increase in DT in morphea-affected sites. The morphological evaluation identified undulations of the dermis and "yoyo" figures. The study did not evaluate hypo DT and echogenicity, too. 14 Additionally, US can be used to evaluate clinical improvement after the treatment. In two previous studies, 20 MHz ultrasound examinations showed a decrease in DT and an increase in the dermal density after treatment. 15,16 In this regard, Porta et al. monitored DT of 10 morphea lesions at baseline and after 6 months of treatment using 18 MHz US and concluded that a reduction in the DT can be suggestive of the disease improvement. 17 In contrast, 50 MHz US quantitative analysis did not show any significant improvement in DT or density after ultraviolet A1 phototherapy, whereas morphological analysis highlighted an improvement in dermal hyperechogenic bundles and disappearance of yoyo figures meaning that in terms of therapeutic response evaluation, pattern analysis is more useful than quantitative analysis. 14 Similar to Arisi et al. study, Weibel et al. followed 22 children with LoS using a 20 MHz probe and did not observe any obvious changes in ultrasound parameters over time. However, there was a weak positive correlation between DT as well as a weak negative correlation between echogenicity and clinical disease activity at the time of treatment initiation. They suggested that despite the clinical improvement, ultrasound structural changes of previously affected areas can last for long periods, or even forever. 18There are discrepancies in available literature because of different cross-sectional study designs, various probe frequencies, and small F I G U R E 1 Color Doppler ultrasound images of morphea plaque in infrapatellar subcutaneous region of 50-year-old male showing dermal thickening and hypoechogenicity, as well as increased echogenicity of hypoderm causing dermal-hypodermal blurredness and increased subcutaneous vascularity comparing adjacent normal soft tissue in favor of active plaque.

SuperSonic Imagine) using 20 MHz probes after diagnosis confirmation of morphea by biopsy and then follow the patients in 3, 6 months, and 1 year interval and report baseline dermal and hypo DT and echogenicity and subcutaneous vascularity in suspicious area of activity based on dermatologist judgment and compare it with normal adjacent or contralateral soft tissue then give a final comments as active, inactive or atrophic plaque based on Wortsman et al. 8 criteria mentioned above, and then dermal and hypo DT and echogenicity of plaques as well as subcutaneous vascularity measure in follow-up exam for the evaluation of disease progression or regression (Figure 1).The most challenging part of ultrasound for follow up is that dermal and especially hypo DT are variable in even one plaque and track thickness difference need to follow the exact location of previous site of US, necessitate the use of picture archiving system for defining the plaque for follow up. Another potential limitation is that sometimes it is impossible to define a similar normal soft tissue at ipsilateral or contralateral side to compare in patients with extensive disease.


cial scleroderma are reported by several authors. T2-hyperintense subcortical white matter lesions ipsilateral to the cutaneous lesion are the most common finding in localized craniofacial scleroderma. Gray matter involvement, calcifications, cysts, ventricular asymmetry, and abnormal parenchymal or leptomeningeal enhancement are other findings reported in localized craniofacial scleroderma. Neuroimaging abnormalities were reported in the absence of neurological symptoms. No consistent relationship between changes in neurological symptoms after the treatment and neuroimaging findings has beendetected.[31][32][33] 


et al. Color Doppler ultrasound can accurately assess morphea activity. Wortsman et al. evaluated 104 morphea lesions using a compact linear probe 7-15 MHz and established that morphea activity can be assessed by using sonographic criteria. Active lesions need two or more of the first three following criteria: increased dermal thickness (DT), increased echogenicity of the subcutaneous tissue, and decreased dermal echogenicity. Notably, increased cutaneous blood flow is a marker of morphea activity itself. Incomplete criteria for active lesions indicate an inactive lesion. Moreover, atrophic lesions are characterized by decreased subcutaneous and DT, without an increase in the blood flow. In comparison with histology as the gold standard, ultrasound was 100% sensitive and 98.8% specific in its ability to differentiate between activity phases. Increased subcutaneous tissue echogenicity and increased cutaneous blood flow are the most accurate indicators of the lesion activity (sensitivity and specificity 100%). Moreover, all five patients with Parry-Romberg syndrome in the study showed signs cluded that there were significant differences in the echogenicity and vascularity of the hypodermis and deep tissues between the active and inactive lesions. Moreover, there were no significant differences between the dermis and other layers in terms of echogenicity or vascularity. However, the researchers suggested that monitoring thickness changes may help to identify the response to treatment because lesions that show persistent thickening or thinning are more likely to be active than those with a static thickness. 10 Twenty MHz US assessment of DT and echogenicity in 92 morphea lesions indicated that there is a significant correlation between the inflammatory phase of the disease and an increase in the DT as well TA B L E 1 Characteristics of the included studies.the DT as well as an increase in the dermal echogenicity, and between the atrophic phase and a decrease in the DT as well as an increase in the dermal echogenicity.

Inflammatory lesions were 
isoechogenic. Moreover, most 

sclerotic and atrophic lesions 

were hyperechogenic and 
hypoechogenic, respectively. No 

significant relationship between 

mRSS and US findings of DT or 
echogenicity was found. Dermal 
hyperechogenicity in US was 

significantly associated with the 
presence of moderate or extensive 
sclerosis on histopathology. There 

was not a significant relationship 
between the depth of sclerosis 
measured by US and histologic 
analysis

regardless of the duration of the 

plaque and can last for many

the dermis, disorganization, loss of 
thickness and thickened

In a study of 16 lesions using 14 MHz US, inflammatory lesions 

were isoechogenic. Moreover, most sclerotic and atrophic lesions 

were hyperechogenic and hypoechogenic, respectively. No significant 

relationship between mRSS and US findings of DT or echogenicity was 

found. Dermal hyperechogenicity in US was significantly associated 

with the presence of moderate or extensive sclerosis on histopathol-

ogy. There was not a significant relationship between the depth of 

sclerosis measured by US and histologic analysis. The study did not 

evaluate hypoderm thickness and echogenicity as well. 12 




The study done by Zemtsov et al. was a seminal paper about the use of MRI in dermatology. 22Imaging features of morphea are not specific and overlap with other disorders that involve skin, fascia, and muscle, such as some types of fasciitis and myositis. Nevertheless, MRI enables a complete assessment of the disease, including the depth of infiltration and the disease activity.23 Zemtsov et al. confirmed an excellent correlation between MRI and histology.24 


et al., 22 patients with systematic scleroderma and deep morphea (DM) underwent whole-body MRI twice, once before treatment and once after receiving methotrexate and prednisone for 6-12 months. MRI scores for subcutaneous and fascial thickening as well as enhancement were F I G U R E 2 soft tissue shear-wave elastography shows increased dermal elasticity compared to adjacent normal soft tissue. significantly lower among those who responded to the treatment. The researchers concluded that MRI can detect changes in musculoskeletal manifestations during the treatment. Thus, MRI can be recommended as a complementary diagnostic tool for monitoring and assessing the clinical response of patients with morphea. 27 Abbas et al. concluded that when using clinical examination solely, lesion's activity might be underestimated. In this regard, the results of MRI demonstrated occult active disease in 19% of patients could change the treatment regimen resulting in continuation or escalation. These discrepancies suggest that by using the mLoSSI alone, active lesions might be underestimated as inactive ones, especially in DM where the activity is difficult to detect. In comparison with the MRI, palpable peripheral induration that is a component of the mLoSSI can properly reflect inflammation. This finding suggests that induration is a sign of activity especially in deeper tissues where erythema is not visible. MRI imaging also revealed the subclinical extension of lesions,
with localized craniofacial scleroderma experiencing new or worsening neurological symptoms.CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENTThe authors declare that there is no conflicts of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTResearch data are not shared.ORCIDYasamin Kalantari https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8443-4591Ifa Etesami https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3026-2485
