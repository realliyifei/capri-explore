Verrucous hemangioma is a rare vascular skin disorder with an immune profile similar to vascular neoplasms, but with behavior and evolution of vascular malformations. Its main differential diagnosis is angiokeratoma circumscriptum neviforme, with an almost indistinguishable clinical presentation because both diseases appear as erythematous patches that evolve to violaceous plaques, becoming scaly and even verrucous, most commonly affecting the lower limbs. Histopathology is crucial for the correct diagnosis: while in angiokeratoma the vascular alterations are limited to the papillary dermis, verrucous hemangioma extends deep into the dermis, reaching the subcutaneous tissue.

Since VH lesions do not regress, but expand as the child grows, treatment becomes challenging. Combined therapy with surgery and laser is considered the first choice, and alternatives include cryotherapy and electrocoagulation. 6 In more extensive cases, in which surgery becomes unfeasible, sirolimus can be an interesting option. 7 q VH: verrucous hemangioma; ACN: angiokeratoma circumscriptum neviforme; IHC: immunohistochemistry

extending to the subcutaneous tissue (Figures 4 and 5). Combined clinical and histopathological findings determined the diagnosis as verrucous hemangioma (VH). hand, vascular malformations consist of errors in vessel morphogenesis, with equal male/female prevalence, that grow proportionally with the child, and that do not display involution or positive IHC for WT1 or GLUT1. 1 Despite important efforts to standardize the nomenclature for vascular anomalies, the case reported here illustrates the difficulty in classifying these disorders. Some authors, like Imperial and scanogram, which measures the limbs comparatively. In the presence of asymmetry, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) should be remembered. The syndrome is characterized by the triad of Port wine stain, venous and lymphatic malformations, and hypertrophy of soft tissues in the affected area. There are some reports of association between ACN and KTS. 5An Bras Dermatol. 2018;93(5):712-5. 

DISCUSSION 
VH is a rare congenital vascular anomaly with a clinical 

presentation very similar to that of angiokeratoma circumstriptum 

neviforme (ACN). The International Society for the Study of Vas-

cular Anomalies (ISSVA) stratifies vascular anomalies into vascular 

tumors and vascular malformations. Vascular tumors, such as in-

small vessels also in the subcutaneous tissue, characteristic of ver-
rucous hemangioma (Hematoxylin & eosin, x200) 

fantile hemangiomas, result from exacerbated cell proliferation, are 

more prevalent in females, tend to regress with the child's growth, 

and present positive immunohistochemistry for WT1 (Wilms tumor 

1 protein) and GLUT1 (glucose transporter-1 protein). 1 On the other 

Helwig, consider VH a malformation involving the subcutaneous 

tissue, with reactive acanthosis and epidermal hyperkeratosis; 2 

however, other authors consider it a true hemangioma (tumor), 

since its present positivity for WT1 and GLUT1. 3 The ISSVA classi-
fication of 2014 includes VH -as well as its principal differential 

diagnosis, ACN -in the disorders yet not classified, since the clini-

cal-pathological characteristics are still not totally clear. 1 

The clinical presentation of VH and ACN include erythem-

atous patches that evolve to squamous and even verrucous plaques, 

most often affecting the lower limbs. 4,5 Given the clinical similarity, 

anatomical pathological examination is imperative for diagnostic 

confirmation. In ACN the epidermal findings of acanthosis with hy-

perkeratosis -often even hypergranulosis -are very evident and

the vascular alterations are limited to the papillary dermis, whereas 

in VH the papillomatosis is a predominant feature, with vascular 

proliferation, and besides accompanying the papillomatosis in the 

papillary dermis, the vessels extend to the deep dermis and subcu-

taneous tissue. Chart 1 summarizes the differences between the two 

disease entities.
