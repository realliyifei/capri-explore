A survey of of blockchain-based solutions for Energy Industry

The energy industry needs to shift to a new paradigm from its classical model of energy generation, distribution, and management. This shift is necessary to handle digitization, increased renewable energy generation, and to achieve goals of environmental sustainability. This shift has several challenges on its way and has been seen through research and development that blockchain which is one of the budding technology in this era could be suitable for addressing those challenges. This paper is aimed at the survey of all the research and development related to blockchain in the energy industry and uses a software engineering approach to categories all the existing work in several clusters such as challenges addressed, quality attribute promoted, the maturity level of the solutions, etc. This survey provides researchers in this field a well-defined categorization and insight into the existing work in this field from 3 different perspectives (challenges, quality attributes, maturity).

# Introduction

Energy has been the fundamental engine of industry and society at least since the first industrial revolution [25]. It has been a determinant factor which shaped society for centuries and it promises to be even more important in the 21st century at the time of the so-called Industry 4.0 [6].

The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts the quality of life and state economy, it can lead to tensions between countries and compromise relationships between nations, therefore the stability of the geopolitical system [2]. In order to foresee a future of political stability and wealth, it is necessary to rely on stable and clean forms of energies that could further foster economic development and peace between nations [27].

The 21st century is marked as the era of digital revolution where we are transforming every possible information in bits and bytes. A natural question to ask is how modern technology could foster a process of transformation toward a clean and stable energy supply and facilitate the transition to global wealth and stability. Fur-thermore, the energy industry showed to slowly adapt to changes in technology, so whatever can be proposed now will still take time to be deployed and utilized.

In this paper, we want to propose ideas on how the energy industry can adapt to the digital world and smart technologies for everyone's benefit, and we summarize the state-of-the-art after surveying the current literature. We will first describe in Section 2 what we consider the major challenges that the modern energy industry has to face today; then, in Section 3, we will use our experience in Software Engineering and take a requirements engineering approach to determine what requirements for the current energy sector are emerging from the described challenges and which quality attributes are being promoted, according to the literature survey on energy and modern technologies that we have conducted. Section 4 categorizes the various solutions according to requirements, that are then classified according to maturity in Section 5. Section 6 finally draws conclusions of the investigation.


# Challenges

In this section, we will discuss what we consider the major challenges that the modern energy industry has to face as we have entered and are in the middle of the world of technological advancements. The following five aspects can synthesize our current understanding:

1. Digitalization in energy sector: Like any other sector, the energy domain is also digitalizing its information and making it available over the internet for faster information exchange and user convenience. Digitalization is not only needed in todays era but also it is a must to operate day to days business. In the 21st century, when almost everything is digitalized, several issues of the classic energy industry have to be addressed: low transparency, no real-time access to demand and supply, etc. At the same time, new challenges appear in the panorama, such as cyber-attacks, misuse of customer data, data manipulation threats, etc, which could adversely affect all the stakeholders involved in the energy industry therefore it is crucial to address these issues of privacy, security, transparency reliability: evolved smart grids is need of the hour. In this paper, we have discussed at least 9 different implementations and proposals published by researchers around the world to implement smarter smart grids and address the challenges of digitization in the energy industry. 2. Fossil Fuel Run out: There is hype around the world about shortage and unavailability of fossil fuel in near future, with the current rate of consumption around the world it is only a matter of time that our fossil fuel runs out. Researchers, scientists, big oil and gas companies, as well as national and international governments and organizations are trying to find alternatives to this energy crisis. The most obvious solution to this is a shift toward Renewable Energy (RE) i.e. from the sun, wind, water, etc. One of the notable features of such renewable sources of energy is that it can be produced in a distributed manner contrary to conventional energy. Due to the distributed nature of RE, it cannot utilize the year-old centralized infrastructure and demands for a new system for generation, management, and distribution. Also, RE is volatile and requires efficient demand-supply management to reduce loses in production and storage. A decentralized system for RE could be the possible solution and could be realized using blockchain technology. This paper discusses 6 different implementation and proposals facilitating a decentralized system for the Renewable energy market. 3. Centralized system not suited for RE generation: As mentioned in the above section that RE is distributed in nature, it is not very convenient to produce them in a centralized manner like any other fossil fuel alternative. Hence it demands a distributed and decentralized system of generation and distribution and management, here blockchain could play a major role to facilitate trading platforms that are suitable for RE, in this paper, we have included 6 proposals of energy trading with RE as its focus. 4. Sustainable Environment: After industrialization there was a huge increase in carbon emission and today, we have reached the stage where we need to think about reducing carbon footprints because it has started showing a negative effect on our climate, human health and seen as a threat to the existence of other living organisms. Hence climate change is real and has been addressed by international organizations like the United Nations [1], and targets of clean energy generation are being set. National and international organizations around the world are imposing strict rules and regulations of energy producers as well as on individual consumers to reduce their carbon footprints and take a huge leap towards decarbonization and environmental sustainability. As the need of the hour, we should focus to increase the share of RE generation and to bring advancement in technology to reduce energy wastage through efficient management and consumption. This paper discusses 11 such proposals and implementation with the focuses on the decarbonization requirement of our planet.


# Categorization of Requirements and Quality Attributes

The previous section identified several challenges that are necessary to address in energy industry. In this section we are taking a software engineering approach to surface the requirements of current energy sector from the challenges. We identified three broader requirements emerging from the previous analysis:

• Digitalization: For communication, social and financial inclusion.

• Decarbonization: To address the issue of fossil fuel run out and environment sustainability and finally • Decentralization: Which is a key for the generation and distribution of renewable energy

In requirements engineering, non-functional requirements (or Quality Attributes) are requirements that do not define specific behaviors, but are used to evaluate the performance of a system. Any attempt to address the challenges presented in this paper would then lead to promoting specific Quality Attributes. In the studied literature we identified 9 quality attributes as follows: 1. Security 2. Transparency 3. Privacy 4. Reliability 5. Scalability 6. Efficiency 7. Ease of trade 8. Demand Supply balance 9. Promote green energy Digitization, decentralization and decarbonization are the major requirement of energy industry in 21st century. Blockchain which is the budding technology of this era is powerful and has the capability of addressing the requirements of energy industry as well. This paper summarises and categories the solution for energy industry implemented using block chain. The paper includes 24 different proposal and implementation of blockchain in energy industry. These papers have been categories according to the problem it addresses, the proposed solution, implementation, conclusion and the quality attributes it promotes. The paper includes 2 diagrams namely fig1 requirement mapping which shows the challenges of energy industry mapped to possible solution that could be implemented using block chain and also lists the quality attribute that could be promoted by implementing these solutions. Another important diagram is fig2 which shows well organized mapping between possible solution and implementation or proposal in different research papers and the quality focus of each research paper. This paper is a well-organized survey of block chain implementation in energy industry and is helpful for researcher or interested readers in this field to get an overview, take reference from the categorization of proposal between solution cat-egory and quality attribute and for pioneer researcher to have a quick reference to different available research paper.


# Various solutions categorized according to requirements

In this section we summarize the findings of our survey that were shortly addressed in the previous section in terms of requirements.


## Digitalization in energy sector

Paper Title: RP-14-A blockchain-based smart grid towards sustainable local energy [17]. Problem Addressed: Centralized energy market used for NRE is not suitable for RES which is volatile, requires distributed generation and real-time mechanism to react in the wholesale market. Proposed Solution: Managing decentralized generation through digitalization. The proposed new market mechanism called Local Energy Market (LEM). It was proposed by the European commission in 2016. Implemented using private and permission blockchain which doesnt require any central authority. LEM is limited to the geographical or social community and balance demand and supply locally. The mathematical formula is developed for accurate calculation of demand and supply and is being forecasted. Conclusion: Implemented online mechanism matching supply and demand, reduce trading complexity by forecasting consumption and generation, the system does not involve any intermediaries. The system is built for small geographical communities using private and permission blockchain which ensure greater security. Problem Addressed: Increased use of non-renewable energy [14].

Distributes energy market for RES generally rely on the day-ahead prediction of demand and supply for trading. This forecast needs to be near to accurate and also prosumer have to develop a trading strategy to maximize profit.  


# Maturity

The different solutions we have surveyed can also be categorized according to an orthogonal dimension, meaning how solid they are considering a range from idea to profitable product. We will use here the following scale:

• Idea: nothing has been done apart from a proposal • Concept: the idea has been structured and conceptualized • Prototype: there is a minimal working system • Product: there is a fully functional system that could be commercialized • Profit: the system is able to generate profit Most of the survey paper included here could be categorized into the top 4 categories namely idea, concept, prototype and product. RP-11 [26], RP-23 [15], RP-24 [19] is just an idea of blockchain-based electricity trading system. RP-15 [18] is a just idea/concept of new currency to trade renewable energy. RP-5 [20] and Rp-6 [28], RP-21 [21] are just exploring the use of blockchain to improve cybersecurity and demand-side management respectively in smart grids and do not propose any solution (Exploring several ideas). Whereas RP-22 [16] presents a state-of-art literature review of the combination of microgrid and blockchain and presents the key findings of the review. Altogether we categorize RP-11, RP-23, RP-24, RP-5, RP-15, RP-21, RP-6, RP-22 as an idea. Rp-4 [9] proposes a Privacy-preserving Energy Trading system and compare and investigate it with other existing models to conclude that their model is better. RP-7 [14]is all about proposing a blockchain-based architecture aimed at regulation of energy production and distribution. RP-8 [22] proposes a demand-side management model and performed a case study to demonstrate the value of their model. RP-12 [7] proposes a model for fraud detection in power grids and suggest some clustering algorithm without any simulation data or results. RP-13 [12] proposes an energy trading system for renewable energy and present software code of trading process using smart contracts. RP-18 [24] proposes a solution for demand-side management and developed a prototype and showed results of implementation. Altogether RP-4, RP-7, RP-8, RP-12, RP-13, and RP-18 could be categorized as a proposal.

Paper RP-1 [29], RP-2 [11], RP-9 [23], RP-10 [13], RP-16 [18], RP-19 [8], RP-20 [4] have a concrete design for their system have already implemented algorithms or software code and have done quality tests such as scalability, transparency, security, performance etc and presented analysis and simulation results. So all together we can categorize these papers into an existing prototype. Whereas as RP-3 [10] has proposed design algorithms and has also implemented a sovereign blockchain-based system on the smart grid and have shown real results for the improved quality attributes such as transparency. RP-14 [17] presents a comprehensive concept, market design, and simulation of a local energy market between 100 residential households. RP-17 [5] proposes a complex architecture for the implementation of SGs using blockchain and implemented a mobile application for information exchange among prosumers hence fall in the category of product.


# Conclusion

This paper has shown how Blockchain technologies can address major challenges of emerge industry with the help of blockchain technology: 1. Digitalization 2. Decarbonization 3. Decentralization The paper survey and categorize challenges of the energy industry in light of the drift towards industry 4.0, shows a general readiness and willingness to embrace solutions from blockchain technology. The research papers included in this survey embodies the perspectives of researchers, experts, analyst, businesses and environmentalists. It attempts to highlights and emphasizes the salient works that have been simulated, published or documented. It provides illumination for the next phase of work and contemporary research ongoing as well as challenges for future work. To arrive at these, a concise and analytical approach was adopted from the software engineering fraternity to not only craftily simplify the volume of work in this field but also offer a template suitable in documenting and discussing the trends, challenges, and solution in the energy sector as a strategic component of the industrial revolution. The paper categorizes the research work according to challenge it is addressing quality attributes it promotes and at last also specify the maturity of each paper. Classification of maturity shows that there is immense work to be done in order to commercialize the existing proposals, as most of them are either idea, concept or prototype. All this categorization together could be helpful to beginner researcher or expert into this field to look at the existing work in a structured manner and can give an insight into the paper form different categorized prospective. Without a doubt, the research works surveyed, depict that digitalization is very instrumental in the modern energy sector just as decentralization and decarbonization. It is worth noting that unlike traditional energy sources, industry 4.0 relies on renewable sources of energy that are deemed distributed or decentralized by nature. This further accentuates the notion to exploit state of the art technology such as a Blockchain network in distributing it after harnessing it within the localities. It also opens the opportunity for individuals to participate in the production and sale of energy. More importantly, it enables authorities to maneuver local challenges of energy supply in the face of difficulties with the national grid. This certainly encompasses the protection and preservation of the environment and addressing climate change brought about by the orthodox energy exploration. There are desirable attributes such as reliability, security, scalability, efficiency, and mobility among others that constitute some of the tenets we used to assess the renewable energy types. We find this to be very useful and strongly recommend the adoption of this approach. However, quality attribute scenarios are not easily distinguished from the functionality of the energy system. This is a caution that a designer and research should consider. The suggested taxonomy and the orthogonal criteria represent a conceptual framework that could be effectively applied to different areas. We are planning to extend the research in the field focusing on broader solutions other than the only Blockchain.
