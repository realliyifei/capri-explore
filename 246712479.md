## INTRODUCTION

Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the infectious disease has caused the worldwide detrimental consequences on social and economic development, with negatively profound impacts on the work and daily life of everyone [1,2]. As of 22 November 2021, there have been over 256 million cases of COVID-19, including 5.2 million deaths, reported to World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. Even though the implementation of Public Health and Social Measures (PHSM) to limit the spread of COVID-19 such as mask wearing, limits and restrictions on public and private gatherings [4], vaccination still can be a key protective measure against COVID-19 to alleviate the devastating effect of the pandemic, and to reduce the considerable burden of public health systems [5][6][7]. Up to November 2021, the vaccine candidates worldwide were 326, of which 132 were in clinical testing [8].

As the generally acknowledged solution to preventing the coronavirus spread [9], the global herd immunity based on vaccination is dependent on not only vaccine safety and efficacy [10], but also individuals' willingness to be vaccinated [11]. An international survey across 19 countries reported that approximately 28.5% of participants would not consider taking a COVID-19 vaccine [12]. This hesitancy and refusal may alleviate the pandemic and put more pressure on health systems [13]. Previous studies already predicted that vaccine hesitancy could be a significant challenge for COVID-19 vaccine rollout [14,15,16]. The definition of vaccine hesitancy is the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccine services [17]. In recent years, vaccine hesitancy among not only citizens but also health professionals has become an emerging issue, as

it could exacerbate vaccine refusal [18,19]. As one of the top 10 global health threats listed by WHO [20,21], vaccine hesitancy varies across time, place, and type of vaccine, and is affected by various factors [22]. Thus, it is necessary to assess vaccine hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine and the factors that influence it in each country, in order to tailor educational activities to increase acceptance of the vaccine.

Since July 2021, vaccinations programs on 3-17 years aged children in China have been launched in some cities and may be covered the whole country step by step [23]. British research on COVID-19 vaccine described that parents were more likely to vaccinate themselves than their child/children, and the main concerns about children vaccination were as follows: not enough evidence, safety concerns, and the belief that children are hardly affected [24]. Actually, children can also become infected and transmit, and develop clinical complications from the COVID-19, so that there is an urgent need to approve children's COVID-19 vaccine uptake [25]. It is noted that the success of vaccinating these children of 3-17 age groups mainly relies on the parents' self-acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and their willingness to vaccinate their child/children. However, little is known about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children and their willingness to vaccinate their child/ children. Moreover, it has been not clear that what factors could predict these parents' vaccine hesitancy.

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is an ongoing issue and a better understanding of its determinants, within the special population of parents with 3-17 years aged children, can be useful in supporting the development of effective and targeted children COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in China and worldwide [26]. Therefore, this study is conducted to explore the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and it predictors among Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children; and their willingness to vaccinate their child/children.


## MATERIAL AND METHOD


## Research design and participants

The cross-sectional study was conducted based on the Sojump online survey platform. The participants were recruited when they had a physical examination in health centers of two hospitals in Shenzhen city. Recruitment was taken place from October to November of 2021 via recruiting posters and leaflets. The inclusion criteria were as follows:

(1) being parents of 3-17 years aged children; (2) living in Shenzhen City (3) willing to participant this study; (4) being able to response the online questionnaires. The exclusion criteria were: parents or their children were with severe mental or physical illness. All participants were informed of the research purpose and process, and were assured of anonymity through the use of special code numbers to identify themselves. Informed consent was obtained from every respondent.

Parents meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to fill in the online questionnaire, which was produced, distributed, and collected with the online survey tool Sojump (http://www.sojump.com). Sojump is a professional online evaluation, survey, and voting platform that can offer humanized services including questionnaire design, data collection, and result reporting [27]. In order to increase the completed questionnaire quality and collect as many valid questionnaires as possible, electronic red envelopes of varying value were randomly distributed to improve respondents' initiative. In total of 3342 valid questionnaires were collected in the research.


## Measurements

A socio-demographic questionnaire was developed by the researchers to collect data of participants' age, gender, nationality, registered residence, marital status, educational level, occupation, family income per month, the age of becoming a parent for the first time, and the number of children.

The aVHS (adult Vaccine Hesitancy Scale) was used to measure vaccine hesitancy. The ten-item instrument is based on a five-point Likert type scale, and the score of 1 represents the lowest degree of vaccine hesitancy and 5 the highest. The aVHS has seven items which are positively worded, and three items which are negatively worded. The total score of the tool ranges from 10-50, with each item scored from 1-5. The aVHS had been validated by the samples in the USA and China, and exhibits good internal consistency (Crohnbach's alpha = 0.82) and validity, making it a reliable and valid tool for measuring vaccination uptake [10]. A score of 10 to 24 was categorized as "not hesitant", while a score of 25 to 50 was considered "hesitant" [10].

We also asked the participants to provide responses for the following items: willingness to get your child vaccinated against COVID-19, willingness to get your parents vaccinated against COVID-19, and willingness to get yourself vaccinated against COVID-19. The range of possible responses for these items was coded 1-5. Perceived trust degree of a COVID-19 vaccine, perceived risk degree of a COVID-19 vaccine, and perceived effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine were likewise asked to response; and the range of possible responses for the three items was coded 1-3. Moreover, whether the parents got vaccination against COVID-19; and whether the parents gave children any other self-funded vaccination (e.g. flu vaccine) were assessed in the study.


## Data analysis

Data analyses were carried out by IBM SPSS Statistics, version 21. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the socio-demographic characteristics and other responses of participants by means (SD) for continuous data, and frequencies (proportions) for categorical data. The chi-square (Ï‡2) was used to detect any significant difference between various groups on the percentage of vaccine hesitancy. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the potential variables that can predict vaccine hesitancy. Multicollinearity was assessed via computing the variance inflation factor (VIF). The Hosmer and Lemeshow test was conducted to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used, and statistical significance was set at alpha < 0.05.


## RESULTS


## Participant profile

Overall, 3484 participants responded to the survey, but 142 participants with incomplete data provided were excluded from data analysis. Finally, in total of 3342 questionnaires were included in the analysis set. The mean age of participants  Table 2.  


## Responses to questions about vaccine hesitancy among participants

In total of 2650 participants (79.3%) with a score of 10 to 24 as measured by the aVHS were categorized as vaccine acceptance, while 692 participants (20.7%) with a score of 25-50 were considered as vaccine hesitancy. The mean scores of ten items in the aVHS were described in Table 3.

## DISCUSSION

A vaccine is well recognized to be one of the most powerful and cost-effective methods for diminishing community spread of COVID-19 in large population [10,28]. However, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among not only citizens but also health professionals has become an emerging issue [18,19]. An international survey reported that COVID-19 vaccine acceptance has high heterogeneity across different countries; therefore, it is important to clarify the acceptance of a vaccine in each country or region [12]. Nowadays, COVID-19 vaccinations programs on 3-17 years aged children in China have been launched in some cities [23]. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to explore the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children, and their willingness to vaccinate their child/children. The research results can be useful in supporting the development of effective and targeted children COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in China and worldwide, by a better understanding of vaccine hesitancy and its predictors, within the special population of parents with 3-17 years aged children.

In this study, we found that the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in Shenzhen City was 79.3% among Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children, much higher than the previous study findings from other countries. For instance, a recently study explored the current COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and hesitancy situation in Japan, and found that 62.1% of Japanese adults would be willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine [28]. It has been reported that the prevalence of vaccine acceptability in Europe approximately ranged from 60.0% to 78.0% [29,30,31,32], i.e., COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 31.1% in Italy [20] and 38.0% in France [32]. Previous research in the U.S. showed that 25.0%-43.1% of respondents reported to be hesitant [33,34,35]. These findings indicated that Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children in Shenzhen City had a higher level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability, compared with adults in Western counties.

In this study, 2976 participants (89.0%) were reported to be willing or very willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for their child/children; 3162 participants (94.6%) were reported to be willing or very willing to accept for an elderly parent; and 3208 participants (96.0%) were reported to be willing or very willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves. The findings were well aligned with the previous studies [13,24] that indicated parents were more cautious about COVID-19 vaccine for their child/children and less likely to vaccine their child/children than their parents or themselves. Therefore, more explanations need to be conducted to alleviate parents' concerns about COVID-19 vaccine for children.

Our research found that parents' attitudes of safety and effectiveness regarding COVID-19 vaccination played an important role in COVID-19 vaccination acceptability and hesitancy. For instance, perceived trust degree of a COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 0.766), and perceived effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 0.455) were positively associated   [13].

To be specific, the majority of the respondents would accept a vaccine with high levels of safety and effectiveness, but only one-third of them would accept a vaccine with lower levels of safety and effectiveness [13]. Unlike previous vaccines with years or decades of clinical trials, COVID-19 vaccines were developed at "wrap speed" [36]. Therefore, parents' concerns over the speed of its development and concerns about safety and effectiveness may be even more prominent for the COVID-19 vaccine. According to the multiple regression analysis, parents with a higher educational level (OR: 0.518) had a lower level of vaccine hesitancy. By contrast, the univariate analysis in Table 1 presented that a significantly higher proportion of participants with a higher educational level had a higher level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitant (p<0.05). The influence of confounding factors in univariate analysis and the most parents having higher education in the study could lead to the opposite results. In the present research, occupation of parents was reported to predict COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. For example, parents working in public institution (OR: 0.741) had a lower level of vaccine hesitancy; whereas, parents with liberal professionals had a higher level of vaccine hesitancy (OR: 1.378). These findings indicated that health professionals should pay more attention to these parents likely to have relatively high COVID-19 hesitancy levels in this context: Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children with lower education level, and parents with liberal professionals. Some limitations need to be noted. Firstly, the crosssectional surveys are to only provide researchers with a snapshot of a sample of population at a single point in time, and cannot enable researchers to capture any changes in COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and hesitancy over time. Secondly, as in studies of this nature, the respondents were the parents who were willing to respond to the questionnaire; and some less motivated parents or those who are less willing to get vaccine were prone to be non-respondents that could lead to a bias in the study. Thirdly, owing to the time and financial limitations, the study focused on parents of 3-17 years aged children merely from one city, which could cause that the group surveyed was not representative of all Chinese parents. In consideration of regional diversity, this study could be replicated in other cities or regions of China.


## CONCLUSION

Vaccinations programs on 3-17 years aged children in China have been launched in some cities since July 2021; and comparative evaluations are important to push the programs forward. COVID-19 Vaccine hesitancy is an ongoing issue and a better understanding of its determinants, within the special population of parents with 3-17 years aged children, can be useful in supporting the development of effective and targeted children COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in China and worldwide. Therefore, this study is conducted to explore the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and it predictors among Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children; and their willingness to vaccinate their child/children. Research found the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 20.7% among Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children in Shenzhen City. Among these parents, 2976 participants (89.0%) were reported to be willing or very willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for their child/children. These findings indicated that Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children in Shenzhen City had a higher level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability, compared with adults in Western counties. The significant factors of perceived trust degree, effectiveness, and risk degree of a COVID-19 vaccine, parents' educational level and occupation could predict COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Chinese parents of 3-17 years aged children. 


. Perceived trust degree of a COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 0.766), and perceived effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 0.455) were negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Perceived risk degree of a COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 1.485) positively predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Parents with a higher educational level (OR: 0.335, 0.518), working in public institution (OR: 0.741), and got vaccination against COVID-19 (OR: 0.399) had a lower level of vaccine hesitancy; whereas, parents with liberal professionals had a higher level of vaccine hesitancy (OR: 1.378).


was 35.35Â±4.95 years, and more than half of them (64.4%) were mothers. The participants' profile is summarized inTable 1. A significantly higher proportion of participants, who were health professionals, with a higher educational level, with a higher family income, aged older than 31 years, and not got vaccination against COVID-19, had a higher level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitant (p<0.05).AAEM
