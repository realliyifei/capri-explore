In this modern era, urbanization is increasing at a higher rate; also the government is already planned for smart cities as well. In one word we can call it is a digital world. Hence the energy consumption is increased rapidly. In recent times several probable keys to the existing environmental concerns related to toxic pollutant discharges have developed to identify and decision making for sustainable energy resolutions connected with green buildings to come across future energy demands. There are renewable sources and they are utilized in a greater manner. In this paper, an attempt is made to review on different Renewable sources of energy like wind and tidal energy, hydropower, sugarcane ethanol, water pumping systems, the concept of green buildings, lignocellulosic bioethanol, solar energy, and Li-Ion batteries. The review includes both advantages and disadvantages of the mentioned energy sources. This Paper gives a brief discussion of different sources of renewable energy and their impact on the environment.

## Introduction

The growth of the economic growth of the country's energy is defended on the major identity of energy [8]. The oceans, river water, water channels, and artificial waterways, etc are the source for the extraction of hydrokinetic energy. From the ocean dynamics, several forms of development energy take place such as wave, wave-current, tidal, ocean surface thermal energy conversion. It is stated that wave energy and wave-current are the processing energy sources [1]. Wind energy is the one of cleanest energy sources it is formed as the first affordable renewable energy contributes around 0.2% contribution to global energy production [13]. Fossil fuels as the main source of energy, which leads to CO 2 emissions at a higher rate. It causes climate change [2]. Biofuels are one of the energy sources in transportation; to produce biofuels lignocellulosic biomass is the source of raw material [1]. But the adoption of the biofuel production process should be taken for sustainability (IEA). In recent days, urbanization is at a higher rate, under circumstances there will be a strong heat island effect noticed due to the high density of buildings [3]. The development in transportation is finding ways to electrification as alternative energy for fossil fuel [4]. In this regard lithium-Ion, batteries (LIB's) have made its footprint with a noticeable development as electrification [5]. This technology already captured as an energy system in mobile platforms [6]. They are now one of the daily needs and there is a production challenge [7]. The geothermal energy contributed around 0.1% during 2008 of the primary energy of global energy. Also, the prediction till 2050 says that it would contribute  [9]. It can be observed that there is increased energy and electricity demand with an increased world population, shown in figure 1 [3].  


## Discussion


## Environmental Impact

With an increase in population and its density is led to higher energy consumption. The supply of energy and production rate is increased over the period. As mentioned in the introduction there is renewable energy, making good contributions to the production of energy. This section attempts to make an address on environmental impact during the generation of energy from the source of renewable energy source The environmental concerns cover incessantly increasing range of contaminants, hazards, and deterioration of the ecosystem in ever wider areas [14] the major ones are acid rain, reduction in the ozone layer of stratosphere, and global climate variation. The greenhouse effect is maybe the most significant environmental issue related to energy usage. Raising of concentrations of greenhouse gases in atmosphere result in increased absorption of heat, due to which greater heat radiation from the earth's atmosphere. Thus increases the temperature on the earth's surface and subsequently rising sea levels [15]. Sugarcane ethanol is a renewable biofuel based on alcohol created by the fermentation of sugarcane residual and molasses [16]. Reviewing the environmental impacts in Brazil for the production of ethanol from the sugarcane increases sustainability objectives but due to this agriculture crop pattern leads to 3 change which will intern affects food security [17]. Sustainable ethanol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a fairly innovative model that has had to acclimate to conventional production approaches and applies in Brazil [18]. Regardless of the facts, the consumption of renewable energy sources and techniques are the key components for sustainable developments like less environmental impact, the likelihood of decentralization [19]. The combination of Renewable and Sustainable Energy with water pumping systems like Solar photovoltaic, Solar thermal, Wind energy, Biomass, and Hybrid renewable energy shows the main role in decreasing the use of conventional energy source and their ecological effects, chiefly for agriculture applications [20]. Waste-to-energy routes yields in place of fossil fuels have an intense perspective for more energy content, like biological hydrogen production, anaerobic digestion, and develop the probable change for a distributed energy quantity system model, absorbed on the on-site biogas and biohydrogen production [21]. The systematic analysis says that sustainable energy recital of green buildings has been changed to a functional and real-world tenacity to reduce the CO 2 discharges and decreases the building zone energy intake. Developing energy-intelligent buildings for sustainable growth in potential towns [22]. The smart energy buildings, which are receptive to the building's zone, and attitude of the users, are indistinguishably related to the probable intentions of sustainable energy effectiveness in green buildings [23].

Hydrokinetic Turbine (HKT) making an adverse effect on the marine environment through its marine device. The ecosystem of marine habitats flora and fauna are affected by barriers of tides, wave energy, and tidal stream plantation [10]. The fauna may collide with the part of the device. The fish passing through different pressure zone of the turbine may collide. The content of bacteria decreases in sediment levels in both upstream and downstream of the HKT vicinity. The operation of energy released affects marine life [11]. The lignocellulosic bioethanol is a sustainable energy form and it has fewer impacts when compared to bioethanol and gasoline. Bioethanol can be mixed with a low percentage with gasoline and 100% can be used in a particularly designed engine. But the production of bioethanol is difficult due to the variation of fossil fuels value and uncertain in the agriculture market [2]. Geothermal leads to health risks, associated with geothermal effluents, natural hazards, atmosphere, climate change, air pollution & gas emissions, land use, land cover, water quality, thermal pollution & biodiversity [12]. As wind energy is sustainable energy, by 2050 its contribution may increase up to 20% to the energy demand. There are some disadvantages during production said energy, like noise production which is more than 50dB, and also impacts human health [13].


## Conclusions

With rapid urbanization, the demand for energy is increased at a much higher rate. In the future, it will be difficult to meet the huge demand for energy. Population growth is also a concern, on the other hand, all the works are relying on the digitalization, electrification which intern demands more energy. Due to increased demand for petroleum products, the CO 2 liberation rate also increases which results in stratospheric ozone reduction and global climate change. To cultivate the "State of art" in the Environment Impact Assessment on renewable energy, innovative work and advance studies are required for ecological civilization growth and commercialization knowledge should be implemented.
