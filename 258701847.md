Electromagnetic waves that have a wavelength of less than one millimeter are referred to as sub millimeter waves. In sub millimeter wave-based devices and systems, antennas are critical components that are vital to their operation. Antennas are used in situations when a transition between a directed wave and a free-space wave is needed. Since, electromagnetic characteristics for receiving and transmission of the nano antenna are mutually invertible, the properties of nano antenna are analyzed in sub millimeter wave frequencies and this overcomes the limitations of conventional antenna design. They are very small in size, provide more efficiency, and do not cause health threat. This paper reviews the applications of nano antenna, which operates at submillimeter wave frequency, in the field of energy harvesting, space technology, IoT applications, 5G network, smart clothing, bio sensing, communication, etc? Also, the nano antenna fabricated by 3D printing technology is also reviewed. The world's ever-increasing energy need necessitates the development of alternate energy sources. There is a lot of research and development going on right now to enhance photovoltaic systems so that they can be more efficient, but the constraint is that they can only collect energy from the visible area of the electromagnetic spectrum. As a result, a novel device known as a Nano antenna has been developed to convert heat energy taken from the infrared spectrum into electricity. In the not-too-distant future, it will have an impact on a wide range of fields, such as mobile communication (5G), radar detection, and higher order frequency applications. Space communication, broadband wireless communications, wireless optical communication, and mobile communication will also benefit from its implementation.

## Introduction

Sub-millimeter radiation, often referred to as terahertz radiation, is made up of electromagnetic waves that have frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 3 terahertz (THz), and their corresponding wavelengths vary from 1 mm to 0.1 mm. This kind of radiation is also known as terahertz radiation. Terahertz radiation begins at a wavelength of around one millimeter and continues farther down into shorter wavelengths; hence, this band of radiation is referred to as the sub millimeter band, and the radiation that corresponds to it is referred to as sub millimeter waves. Due to the fact that sub millimeter radiation is totally attenuated within a few meters of its source and is completely absorbed by the surrounding atmospheric gases, this kind of radiation is not appropriate for use in radio transmission. THz beams that get transmitted through materials can be used for material characterization, layer inspection, and as an alternative approach for X- 2 rays in order to produce high resolution images [1]. It has the potential to penetrate through thin layers of materials, and THz beams that get transmitted through materials can be used for this purpose. In this frequency range, it is no longer feasible for typical electronic devices to generate electromagnetic waves or modulate those waves. As a result, it is necessary to build new electronic devices as well as new methodologies. Another disadvantage of systems that were based on sub millimeter waves was that it was impossible to acquire planar detectors that were suitable for use with integrated antennas [2].

Since of this, comprehensive research on sub millimeter wave radiation has not been carried out because trustworthy components and devices are required in these frequency ranges. As a result of this, the research has been limited. Recent developments in technology have made it possible to investigate the electromagnetic spectrum and to develop original imaging and sensing methods. These approaches have led the way for many potentially useful applications in the fields of biomedicine, metrology, and security. Antennas are crucially important components of sub millimeter wave-based devices and systems, and they are used in situations when a transition between a directed wave and a free-space wave is needed [3]. Antennas may be divided into two categories: directional antennas and patch antennas. Integrated circuit antennas are typically constructed on a substrate lens in order to suspend losses at sub millimeter wavelengths. This technique takes advantage of the fact that antennas mounted on dielectrics are more sensitive to radiation [4], and it is the most common method for building integrated circuit antennas.

Because of weak patterns and dielectric losses, coupling efficiencies have been capped at 25% despite the fact that integrated circuit antennas are dependable and have extremely high sensitivities. At sub millimeter wavelengths, the dielectric losses are more noticeable due to their increased severity. To overcome such drawbacks associated with antenna, research on nano antenna particularly becomes important due to low loss and localized surface Plasmon effect [5]. Hence, in this paper, the nano antennas for operating at sub millimeter wavelengths frequencies are reviewed and its possible applications in the field of bio sensing, energy harvesting, smart clothing, space technology, internet of things, and recently 5G applications were presented.


## About Nano Antenna

Nano antennas, which are sometimes referred to as optical retina or rectifying antenna, play a significant part in the area of nano photonics and are utilized in a wide variety of new applications, such as wireless nano-link, heat transfer, photovoltaic, light emission, and super-resolution microscopy. Metallic materials are able to support the one-of-a-kind optical surface Plasmon phenomena; therefore, the conventional antenna design principles need to be amended in order to include the oscillation of collective conducting electrons and also to include the ideal electrical conductor. Nano antennas, on the other hand, are made by fabricating metal nanostructures with dimensions less than a wavelength. These nanostructures have the ability to maintain a localized surface plasm on (LSP) that stays put in constrained structures. There are several variants of the nano antenna, some of which include dipoles, bowties, Yagi-Uda, core-shell, and split-ring-resonator antennas. In recent years, dielectric nano antennas have garnered more attention than their metallic counterparts because to the minimal losses that they experience in comparison to the latter. In addition, nano antennas are used in order to transform the energy originating from the quantum dots and the wave that is entering the waveguide into a wave that is free to go throughout the environment. The radiation pattern might be skewed in the desired direction by incorporating a nano-particle into the construction of the antenna and moving it to a different position.


## Nano antenna in current technologies


### Antenna for energy harvesting

Nano antenna is the nano scope rectifying antenna. Due to the advancements in the nano science and nanotechnology, integration of nano antenna into the solar energy harvesting system is made possible. The role of nano antenna is to transform the thermal energy, radiating from the sun, into electrical energy and this antenna particularly focuses on mid infrared wavelength where the conventional photovoltaic cell conversion is not efficient [6]. Sur et al demonstrated how solar radiation could be transformed into usable electric energy using n-antenna. The proposed antenna is designed, analyzed and observed that n-antenna is better than conventional photovoltaic (PV) technology and produces more than 70 % of electrical energy. Conventional solar cells cannot absorb radiation having lower wavelength which leads to low efficient conversion. When the wavelength is proportional to the size of the device, the n-antenna can absorb it. Comparative study has shown that efficiency of the n-antenna can be more than 93 % and this efficiency depends on the fabrication technology of the PV cells and as well as material of n-antenna [7].

Author proposed the broadband nano antenna which includes dual triangle, a hexagonal pillar and a ring column as its elements for the purpose of solar energy harvesting. The suggested antenna's optical characteristics are investigated by using the three-dimensional finite difference time domain technique (FDTD), and the results show that the proposed antenna has an average absortivity of 84.53% in the visible and near-infrared bands. In addition to this, they are excellent at absorbing the effects of lightning rods, Fabry-Perot resonance, and the increase of localized surface Plasmon resonance [8]. The thermocouple antenna was conceived and proven by Briones et al. for use in applications involving the detection of light and energy harvesting. They performed a theoretical analysis of the efficiency of converting optical energy to electrical energy for the purpose of energy harvesting. In addition, they investigated the antenna's capacity to generate low-power DC signals due to the thermoelectric properties of the metallic materials that make it up [9].


### Antenna for space technology

It built an advanced backfire antenna (A-SBFA) accelerated with anisotropic Meta material surface (meta surface) and examined the operations of the antenna. This was done in order to obtain increased aperture efficiency. Because of its one-of-a-kind characteristics, such as its low weight, compact design, hexagonal aperture, excellent dual-band efficiency, strong cross-polarization isolation, and minimal danger of multiplication and passive inter modulation (PIM), the A-SBFA is largely used for space-borne applications. Aluminum, which is advantageous for use in high power antenna applications, is used in the fabrication of an A-SBFA antenna's cavity, which is made possible using additive manufacturing technology. When an antenna is fabricated as a singular and uncomplicated construction, the level of complexity and susceptibility that would otherwise reduce the signal's quality in a satellite connection is significantly reduced. The suggested antenna was successful in achieving an average aperture efficiency of more than 90%, which is very high when compared to the efficiency of antenna structures that do not have Meta surfaces [10]. It evaluated the terahertz response for various applications related to space research and detailed the nano antenna that was created out of Roger's RT 5880 substrate and had copper plating's on both sides. It has been suggested that the dimensions should be 8 by 14 by 0.324 mm3, and it should be able to function at a frequency of 101.71 GHz W-bands. The gain and efficiency that have been attained are 6.155 decibels and 98.6% respectively [11].

When compared to monitoring spacecraft missions in low earth orbit, following missions in deep space is a whole new and unique experience. In order to successfully monitor and gather the payload data from the spacecraft, the mission requires a certain minimum number of ground stations. Due to the fact that the spacecraft are scattered across the globe at very great distances from one another, the deep space ground stations need to be equipped with very large diameter reflector antennas, cryogenically cooled low noise amplifiers, highly ultrasensitive receivers, demodulators, data handling systems for data reception, and high power transmitters for up-linking commands to spacecraft. For data reception, the Indian deep space network station in Bangalore makes use of a reflector antenna with a 32-meter diameter that is fitted with sensitive receivers. For uplink, the station employs high-power amplifiers with a capacity of 20 kW. There was discussion of using a multitude of smaller reflector antennas to achieve the same goal. An experiment with two 10-meter reflector antennas was conducted at the Bangalore ground station in order to demonstrate the array idea for deep space communications. When combined, two 10 meters provide a signal that is at least 2.5 decibels better than it was before [12].

In contrast to the X bands, the VHF and S bands are not suitable for telemetry applications because to the high data rate requirements imposed by nano satellite operations. A novel reconfigurable beam antenna was suggested by Sibling et al. to be used on the nano satellite in order to improve the efficiency of the spatial telemetry linkages. When constructing the agile beam antenna, an innovative technique known as ARMA (Agile matrix radiating antenna) is employed rather than the more conventional approach of using the array idea known as AESA (Agile electronically scanned array). The ARMA method samples the radiating surfaces using pixels that have been linked together. A square low profile ARMA antenna was built with 25 pixels, of which only 9 are fed by the BFN (Beam forming network); the other ones located at the edges of the antenna are only used to keep a signal a good axial ratio for the whole matrix antenna. The goal of the design was to create a pixel that can generate a uniform EM field on its surface. [13] presents a dual-mode agile antenna that operates in accordance with the ARMA concept.


### Antenna for IoT applications

The Internet of Things makes it possible for machines to talk to each other without any assistance from a person. A low cost energy harvester was presented by Shafique et al. for use in Internet of Things applications. This gadget employs a retina in order to alleviate the issue in locations where there is a battery restriction problem. This energy harvester was developed for use in IoT applications and energy harvesting, and it recycles the radio frequency (RF) energy at 2.4 GHz that is emitted by surrounding Wi-Fi and WLAN networks. The developed antenna is effective because it receives an RF power of -73 d BM at 2.4 GHz, which is comparable to the RF power received by Wi-Fi antennas that are already on the market [14]. The development of composite materials based on graphene paves the way for the attainment of wireless communication at the nano scale level. This is made possible by the reduction in size of the antenna, which prepared the way for the development of more recent systems based on nano antennas. Nano antennas of this kind have the potential to emit electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz region. Applications that include the internet of things (IoT) are thus a viable use for micro antennas. It provided an overview of the most recent developments in the field of graphene-based plasmonic nano antennas. They explored additional relevant aspects and addressed the future study topics of graphene based nano antennas [15]. They evaluated the characteristics of nano antennas in terms of surface Plasmon resonance waves.

Molex is able to give significant experience in antenna technology from the idea stage all the way through the completion phase. In the design of ready-to-use radio frequency (RF) antennas for Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, industrial, and medical applications, the antennas must be small, high performing, and available in numerous protocols and frequencies. High RF performance combined with simplicity of integration across 433, 868, and 915 MHz bands is what 15M stand-alone antennas provide, making them ideal for use in the growth of industrial, scientific, and medical domains [16]. Also, researchers developed nano antenna having two membranes for IoT applications. Two membranes: first one uses piezo-magnetism principle and it is made up of iron (Fe), gallium (Ga) and boron (B) layers whereas the second one uses piezoelectric conversion principle and it is made up of aluminum nitride (AlN) layer. The magnetic signal caused by the first membrane produces electrical signals needed for transmission and receiving for IoT devices in the second membrane [17]. 


### Antenna for 5G applications

The sector of mobile communication is now experiencing a period of rapid growth as well as a significant uptick in the number of new technologies. Most notably, the mobile communication systems of the fifth generation, also known as 5G, have evolved to the point where they may give a variety of solutions to the problems that are linked with the technology. Recent developments in electronic technology and communication have allowed for the growth and development of machine-to-machine communication, which has led to the emergence of new categories of requirements. In the previous method, the amount of spectrum available in the bands below 6 GHz was restricted. However, the use of newer bands is required in order for 5G systems to support Internet of Things applications [18].

The scientists developed and built the micro strip patch antenna for use in 5G applications using a polyethylene tere phthalate (PET) substrate with a thickness of 0.125 millimeters. The wideband antenna is fabricated with the help of cutting-edge inkjet printing technology, and conductive ink is created with the help of nano particles of silver. An omni directional radiation pattern with an average gain of 5 dB may be seen from the antenna that was created. Additionally, it was examined for bending, and its linear performance within X bands was found to be satisfactory [19]. The author conducted research on a single band micro strip patch antenna that has the capability of operating in frequency bands up to 60 GHz for use in 5G applications. Analysis of the planned patch antenna is performed in Roger RT5880 with the dielectric, loss tangent, and thickness set at 2.2, 0.0009, and 0.003, respectively, using inset feeding with an overall size of 2.9 x 3.5 mm2. A combination of an H-slot and two rectangular U-slots was loaded into the radiator so that the antenna's bandwidth could be increased. The designed antenna is given a computational analysis with the software CST studio. The results of this analysis show that the maximum reflection coefficient obtained is approximately -41.648731 dB at 60 GHz, and that the antenna has a gain and bandwidth of approximately 30 GHz and 8.82dB respectively [20]. The tiny two port planar array antenna for 26 GH 5G broadcasting applications was created and studied by it. It is planned that the antenna will consist of two dipoles in addition to a substrate integrated cavity (SIC) for the purpose of power splitting. By merging the resonant frequencies of the dipole and SIC, it is possible to produce a wide bandwidth of around 24 to 29.5 GHz. To realize the huge array structure with reduced loss and size, the dual port is proposed that combines the radiation and power splitting functions. An 8-element array dual port structure is designed and prototypes and the enhanced gain of over 12 dB are achieved [21].


### Antenna for flexible and smart clothing

Coupling the textile antenna with the smart clothing is emerging in the recent years and it provides interesting solutions particularly where the replacement of batteries in wearable devices is impracticable. For electromagnetic energy harvesting applications, it developed a smart and stable fabric that was covered with a dual band textile antenna. This antenna was designed to operate at both the mobile communication (GSM) 900 and digital cellular system (DCS) 1800 bands. Seven separate prototypes were created by using the following two distinct production processes: thermal adhesive lamination and embroidery. In a vacuum table, the antennas are cemented together using an ironing technique that involves steam [22].

It came up with three distinct configurations of textile antennas. They are referred to as the planar inverted-F antenna, the annular slot antenna, and the rectangular micro strip patch antenna (PIFA). The use of these antennas in smart clothing led to their development at a frequency of 2.45 GHz, which is part of the Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) spectrum. Fabrication of the radiator and the ground both make use of conductive materials like copper-plated polyester fabric. The fabrication of substrate materials involves the use of a non-conductive neoprene fabric that has a thickness of 4 millimeters and a permittivity of 1.5. The planned textile patch antenna achieves a maximum gain of 5.96 dBi and a bandwidth of 4.6%, while the yearly slot antenna has a gain of 2.9 dBi and a bandwidth of 13.1%. In a similar vein, the PIFA antenna achieves a gain of 1.2 dBi and a broad bandwidth of 31%. In order to determine whether or not the suggested antenna designs are viable for use in wearable applications, further research was conducted to investigate how the proposed antennas reacted when bent in a variety of various ways [23].

Inkjet printing technology was used in order to print an ultra-wide band (UWB) flexible antenna onto a substrate made of kotak photo paper that had a thickness of 0.254 millimeters. The printed antenna has a virtually unidirectional emission pattern throughout the entire UWB band, including frequencies from 3.2 to 3 GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 161%. It is recommended that the dimensions of the monopole type antenna developed should be 33.7 mm by 32.7 mm by 0.254 mm, and it should be supplied via CPW (coplanar waveguide) by loading a circular radiator in order to increase the bandwidth. It was determined that an average gain of around 4.87 and an efficiency of approximately 86.61% could be attained [24].


### Antenna for bio sensing applications

Presented an innovative nano-aperture in the form of a cross loop with a graphene overcoat for use in spectroscopic and biological applications. The structure incorporates a gold layer that has a cross loop aperture, and both of these components are situated atop a SiN layer that has a n value of 1.98. On top of the gold layer is a coating of graphene, which is there to increase the transmittance. After having a thin layer of chromium placed on top of the gold layer using electron beam lithography, multilayer graphene with a thickness of one nanometer is then coated on top of that. This procedure is done so that the bonding between the graphene and gold may be strengthened. The CST microwave studio simulator was used to analyze several configurations, each of which had a varied number of loops and a variable number of graphene layers. The results of this analysis allowed for the identification of the optimal configuration. The final form of the prototype nano antenna consists of a single sheet of graphene, and it has dual band characteristics at 46 and 86 THz. This antenna is being used for biological sensing applications that operate in the mid infrared range. The orthogonal quality of this prototype structure is beneficial for applications involving solar cells and energy harvesting [25].

The paper analyzed the optical nano antenna in terms of the many applications that may be found in bio sensing technology. In a manner similar to that of antennas that function in the radio frequency domain, the objective of optical micro antennas is to concentrate the energy of free propagating radiation. To this account, Optical nano antennas uses the potential metal nanostructures properties and this can be used to detect the millimeter, infra-red and visible spectrum frequencies. All the extensive review of optical antenna towards the bio sensing applications and their challenges were carried out [26]. Indeed, plasmonic nano antenna is advantageous for numerous applications in the field of bioscience, nanotechnology and in the field of photonics due to the enhancement and confinement of optical fields. Toussaint discussed the gold (Au) Bowtie nano antenna (BNAs) and analyzed how the optical field enhancement properties can be used for biological particle manipulation and sensing purposes. They also developed the pillar based BNAs and analyzed their particle sensing ability in the near infrared region [27].


### 3D Printed Antenna

Zhang et al. used the technique of metallic 3-D printing for antenna implementations that were capable of operating up to 325 GHz. An investigation of the printing methods of binder jetting/sintering and selective laser melting (SLM) was carried out on 316L stainless steel and Cu-15Sn materials, respectively. In light of the expense and performance, manually polished Cu-15Sn was selected as the material for the fabrication of a series of conical horn antennas, which were then subjected to computational analysis. This method was then contrasted with the traditional micromachining-based metallic horn antenna. The metallic horn antennas that are 3-D printed offer benefits in terms of being kind to the environment, having a cheap cost, and having a rapid turn-around time [28].

Controlling the laser's phase, polarization, and beam intensity was accomplished by George et al. via the presentation and fabrication of micro antenna templates by employing a technique that is based on a single reflecting optical element. The technique known as 3D holographic printing is used in the process of designing and precisely fabricating the single optical element. This technique of holographic manufacturing is shown to work with both positive and negative photo resists combinations. The nano antenna pattern that was built is in good accord with the findings that were acquired through modeling. [29]. Discusses the nano gap size of nano antennas as well as their controlled manufacture in terms of the capabilities of the single-optical-element method.


### Antenna in Communication

It was discussed an antenna for a dual band focal plane array (FPA) based heterodyne receiver that operates at 210-240 GHz and 500-580 GHz. The antenna is proposed to have fused silica lens with leaky wave waveguide feed based on single-layer frequency selective surface (FSS) having a quasi-optical system with overlapped beams and equal beam widths for operating at 210-240 GHz and 500-580 GHz frequency bands [30]. On a substrate made of 4-cyano-4-pentylbiphenyl [5CB], it was investigated how a sub millimeter wave antenna behaved while operating throughout a frequency range of 0.1 THz to 10 THz, and the results were analyzed and compared. Both the rectangular patch antenna (RPA) and the cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (CDRA) are taken into consideration when it comes to the physical characteristics of an antenna. These characteristics include the size and shape of the antenna, as well as its gain/directivity, resonant frequency, bandwidth, and efficiency. These well-known millimeter-wave antennas are put to use by the sub millimeter-wave antenna so that its operational behavior may be evaluated. In addition, an investigation of the functionality of a huge sub millimeter wave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) (8 by 8) RPA and CDRA was carried out [31].

The fundamental need is for light to be controllable at the nano scale dimension; however, this requirement takes on a greater level of significance for applications such as optical sensing, metrology, information processing, communications, and quantum optics. Significant research and development efforts are now being directed toward the creation of optical nano antennas. These nano antennas have the ability to convert light into localized radiating energy and vice versa, making them the focus of current research and development activities. Tang et al. exhibited a directed three-dimensional nano antenna that could function in the visible light domain. They also demonstrated a straightforward bottom-up method for the fabrication of arrays of nano antennas. In addition to this, they investigated the functioning of the operating system via the interaction of quantum dots (QDs) [32].

An analytical computation of the polarizability and non-linear impedance of a nano sphere is shown here. This nano sphere was stimulated by an optical pulse with a high intensity. It makes it possible to develop non-linear devices that are constructed of nano spheres, such as nonlinear Meta surfaces for optical wavelengths. The polarizability of a nano particle is what affects the intensity of the incident light that it scatters and the degree to which the incident field is amplified in the neighborhood of the particle. It should be emphasized that the electric field, when applied to arrays of nano spheres, is the sum of the applied field and the interaction field from other nano spheres in the array [33]. This is because the electric field is a vector quantity.


## Conclusion

In order to collect sub millimeter waves for use in space applications, biomedical applications, imaging and remote sensor applications, smart clothing, energy harvesting, and Internet of Things applications, a number of studies have been carried out, and many approaches have been suggested. The choice of antenna as well as the design of the antenna chosen has a significant impact in the functioning of these applications. After analyzing various literatures; it is observed that the nano antenna designed for sub millimeter waves overcome the limitations of conventional antenna. They are very small in size, provide more efficiency, and do not cause health threat. The wide range of applications found with sub millimeter waves paves the way for innovation in nano-materials over 5G band of frequencies. The world's everincreasing energy demand cannot be met only by nonrenewable energy sources, thus extracting the maximum amount of energy from renewable energy sources has become a problem. Sun energy is one of the renewable energy sources; however the efficiency of existing photovoltaic systems is insufficient to convert all of the solar energy into electric power. We've talked about a new gadget called a nano antenna, which turns heat energy into electrical energy and improves the efficiency of solar cells by a factor of 10.
