## INTRODUCTION

In diabetes mellitus a chronic endocrine disorder, abnormally high blood glucose is the major feature.2][3] Though despite harmful side effects, insulin and synthetic oral hypoglycaemic agents are widely used in management of diabetes. 4It is as a result of these harmful side effects that, herbal remedies are also preferred because they are safe for long-term use, easily accessible, and cost effective hence many rural dwellers could easily afford these.It is also in recognition of this that the ethnomedicine is of great interest in the scientifi c world in the past decades or so.

Ethnomedicine is concerned with the study of medical systems from the native's point of view.In ethnomedicine, native categories and explanatory models of illness including aetiologies, symptoms, courses of sickness and treatment are investigated. 5,6The ethnomedical approach is very useful in the study of indigenous therapeutic agents because it allows the researcher to understand the treatment patterns according to native explanatory models.Furthermore, in order to preserve traditional medicinal knowledge, it is necessary that inventories of plants with therapeutic value are carried out and the knowledge related to their use documented in systematic studies.Ethnomedicinal surveys provide the rationale for selection and scientifi c investigation of medicinal plants since some of these indigenous remedies have been successfully used by signifi cant numbers of people over extended periods Objectives: A comprehensive survey with the aim of documenting traditional medicinal practices was carried out in targeted areas of Ibadan, Nigeria in order to inventory plants used by traditional healers in the area for the management of diabetes.Materials and Methods: Open-ended informal interviews were administered during series of repeated visits to the respondents consisting majorly the traditional medical practitioners (TMPs) and herb sellers.Some traditional healers who know and use medicinal plants for treating diabetes mellitus were interviewed.The inventory contains scientifi c, vernacular, common names of the plants used and methods of preparation.Results: Twenty seven plants commonly used by traditional healers in the region were identifi ed.These plants were found to be very important and useful in the treatment of diabetes based on their frequency of occurrence in the recipes obtained.Herbal remedies were either prepared from dried or freshly collected plants while traditional solvent of choice included water, lime, local gin and aqueous extract from fermented maize.Decoction and pulverization were the main methods of preparation while mode of administration varies within 1 to 3 times daily.Survey revealed that leaves form the major part of plants for herbal preparations.Residents in the study area fi nd traditional medicine cheaper as compared to orthodox medicine.Conclusion: This review focuses on the various plants that have been reported to be effective in the treatment of diabetes.The survey shows that plants from the Rubiaceae, Labiataceae, Meliaceae, Hypoxidaceae and Cucurbitaceae families are commonly used by traditional healers in Ibadan for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

of time. 7According to the World Health Organization, at least 80% of people in developing countries depend largely on indigenous practices for the control and treatment of various diseases affecting both human beings and their animals. 8The surveys also help the conservation of traditional knowledge through the identifi cation of medicinal plants with market potential that can generate incomes for local communities [Figure 1].

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by high blood glucose level resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. 9It is a chronic disorder that affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and electrolytes in the body, leading to severe complications which are classifi ed into acute, sub-acute and chronic.Acute complications include hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar and hyperglycaemic non-ketotic syndrome, 10 while sub acute complications include thirst, polyuria, lack of energy, visual blurriness and weight loss, 9 chronic hyperglycaemia causes glycation of body proteins which in turn leads to complications that may affect the eyes, kidneys, nerves and arteries. 11It is a major health problem with its frequency increasing every day in most countries. 12The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is on the increase worldwide and it is still expected to increase by 5.4% in 2025. 13rbal medicine is known to play an important role in diabetic therapy, particularly in the developing countries where most people have limited resources and do not have access to modern treatment. 14In the last few years there has been an exponential growth in the fi eld of herbal medicine and these medicinal plants are gaining popularity both in developing and developed countries because of their natural origin and less side effects. 15Based on the historical success of natural products as antidiabetic agents, the side effects associated with the use of orthodox drugs such as insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents and the ever increasing need for new antidiabetics, there is an increase in demand for the use of plant based medicines to treat diabetes. 16Another important factor that strengthens the use of plant materials as anti diabetics could be attributed to the belief that medicinal plants do provide some benefi ts over allopathic medicine and allow the users to feel that they have some control in their choice of medication. 17e aim of this survey was to compile the different indigenous plants in Ibadan used for the management of diabetes.


## MATERIALS AND METHODS


## Study area

Ibadan is the capital city of Oyo state and the third largest metropolitan area by population in Nigeria with the total estimated population of 1,338,659 according to 2006 census, The land area is 3,080 square kilometer. 18Ibadan came into existence in 1829; it is located in the south eastern part of Oyo state and south western part of Nigeria, 128km inland northeast of Lagos and 530km southwest of Abuja.Ibadan is classifi ed as a derived savannah, it has a tropical wet and dry climate with a lengthy wet season and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year.The city is naturally drained by four rivers with many tributaries including Ona river, Ogbere river, Ogunpa river and Kudeti river.The people are mainly Yoruba people; the main indigenous occupation of the people is farming.


## Ethnomedicinal survey

The main data sources consisted of a series of informal interviews and general conversation administered on the local herb sellers and other groups of people rich in traditional medicine knowledge.The interviews were done in their native language (Yoruba language), while the information gathered was sorted, the data collected included the local names of plants and parts of the plants used.The plants were identifi ed by their vernacular names and later validated at the Department of Botany, University of Ibadan.

Descriptive statistics such as pie chart and percentages were used in the analysis of the data.


## RESULTS


## Respondents' identity

All the respondents were females with 65% within the age range of 41-50years, 25% within the age range of 51-60years, while about 10% were above 60years.All of them were married; 90% of the respondents were herb sellers and 10% were traditional medical practitioners.Majority of the respondents were either primary school leavers or secondary school leavers and most of them claimed that they inherited their vocation and ethnomedicinal knowledge from their parents.All the respondents were Yoruba speaking people.


## Ethnomedicinal survey

A total of 27 plants were described as being used for the treatment of diabetes, plant forms include the climbers, herbs, shrubs and trees.The plant parts used mostly from the identified plants include the leaves, fruits and roots [Table 1].Prominent among the plant species mentioned for the treatment of diabetes mellitus are Vernonia amygdalina and Ocimum gratissimum.It was observed that recipes were made from combination of different parts from more than one plant species including fruits and leaves mostly, while some were made from single plant part.The preferred solvents in most preparation were water, soft drink, local gin and liquid from fermented maize (Table 2).

Oral administration was the only mode of administration of the herbal treatment for diabetes in the study areas in Ibadan, similarly, the method of preparation mostly preferred were by decoction, squeezing, boiling (in water), soaking, grinding/pounding, drying and pulverization into powder (Table 3).


## DISCUSSION

Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormalities in carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism.The effects of uncontrolled diabetes include inability to see clearly, recurrent boils on the skin, leg ulcers that fail to heal, frequent urination, weight loss, inordinate appetite, mental depression, progressive weakness, thirst and dry tongue. 19In Nigeria, most diabetic patients consult traditional medical practitioners (TMPs) to manage their health condition. 20As a result of this, the From the study, It was observed that leaves formed the most frequently used part for diabetes (40%), followed by fruits (16%), root (16%), seeds (7%), stem/bark (7%), bulb (5%), fl ower (5%), rhizome (2%) and whole plant (2%).

The plant leaves are important ingredient in traditional treatment of various diseases as it occurred as a component in many herbal preparations. 21jority of the herbal recipes were observed to be polyherbal (i.e. in combination), while some were prepared from single plant source.Polyherbal therapy is said to be a current pharmacological principle having the advantage of producing maximum therapeutic effi cacy with minimum side effects. 22Polyherbal therapies have the synergistic, potentiative, agonistic/antagonistic pharmacological agents within themselves that work together in a dynamic way to produce therapeutic effi cacy with minimum side effects. 23


## CONCLUSION

The practice of traditional medicine has been from time immemorial and the rural population depends mostly on it. 24In addition to the documentation of traditional medicinal practices used for the treatment of diabetes in the study area, this study have provided the ethnomedicinal foundation for the pharmacological properties of notable medicinal plants and their therapeutic effects on diabetes.This study further strengthened the relationship between indigenous knowledge, ethnomedicinal practices, drug discovery and pharmacology.Considering the rich cultural traditions of plant use and the high prevalence of diabetes, more in vivo investigations should be encouraged in order to validate the antidiabetic activity of the identifi ed plants as claimed by the traditional healers.
