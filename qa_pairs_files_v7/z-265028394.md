(p16.0) In this study, [15], investigated the possibility of classifying AD patients among 158 patients with MCI or dementia of various causes based on a neuropsychological test (NPT).The algorithm Support Vector Classifier was used to predict AD based on the results of the tests conducted and achieved high accuracy, 82-89%.Another study [16] aimed to identify morphological changes in brain tissue caused by AD and set it up as a diagnostic marker.The authors developed techniques for automatically detecting and segmenting the corpus callosum.1437 MRIs were applied in a multivariate pattern analysis using SVM.
