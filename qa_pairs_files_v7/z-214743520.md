(p27.0) To remove the limitation of training on clustered mini-graphs for large-scale graphs, IntentGC [46] introduces a special graph neural network, which replaces the normal aggregator and updater in GNNs with a vector-wise aggregator and a vector-wise updater. The key idea is to avoid unnecessary feature interactions by replacing the expensive matrix multiplication between a huge weight matrix and a giant feature vector (formed by concatenation of many vectors) with a summation of multiple small matrix products. The detailed formulation is shown in Table 3. [30] performs personalized recommendation by converting the knowledge graph into a user-specific weighted graph, on which a graph neural network is applied Social Network Epinions 175,000 508,000 - [6], [36] to compute personalized item embeddings. The weights of edges on this new graph are computed by a trainable function f (z e ) that identifies important knowledge graph relationships for a given user. We refer this technique as graph translation.
