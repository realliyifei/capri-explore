(p7.0) Tumor sequencing has identified several targetable alterations for tumor-agnostic therapies, that, to date, have been used for patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent ampullary adenocarcinoma.One example is mismatch-repair deficiency (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI-H)/high tumor mutation burden (TMB-H).Xue et al. analyzed 127 ampullary adenocarcinomas (68% either INT or PB), with 18% (n = 23) demonstrating abnormal MMR staining.The loss of both MLH1/PMS2 was identified in 15 patients, whereas 2 patients had a loss of both MSH2/MSH6 [53].Similarly, the hidden-genome colorectal genomic profile is characterized, in part, by high TMB [51].The MMR mechanism is a cellular system that recognizes and repairs mismatched nucleotides during DNA replication or recombination or from external damage.Somatic or germline mutations in the genes responsible for the MMR repair apparatus (i.e., mutL Homologue 1 (MLH1), mutS Homologue 2 (MSH2), mutS Homologue 6 (MSH6) and postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2)) can lead to a deficient system.Microsatellites are repetitive sequences of genome, usually less than six base pairs, scattered in the DNA.If two or more repeats are altered, the tumor is considered MSI high (MSI-H), whereas MSI low (MSI-L) is a tumor where only one repeat is altered; if no alterations are found, the tumor is considered microsatellite stable (MSS) [54].Pembrolizumab, a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, is recommended for ampullary cancers that are dMMR, MSI-H or TMB-H (â‰¥10 mut/Mb); similarly, nivolimumab/ipilimumab is recommended for MSI-H, dMMR INT tumors.Patients with recurrent or advanced MSI-H or dMMR disease are candidates for Dostarlimab-gxly, another PD-L1 inhibitor [22].
