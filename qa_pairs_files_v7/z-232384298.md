## (s9) Human-Robot Control Interfaces

(p9.0) Human-robot control interfaces (invasive and noninvasive) are technologies that acquire, decode, and communicate the intention of a human user to a device via control commands ( Figure 3). Such a device can be a wearable exoskeleton or a prosthetic/bionic device [7]. The technologies mentioned in this section interface either directly (digital-neural interfaces) or indirectly (EMG interfaces) with the PNS or with the CNS (BCIs) [101,102]. Such technologies use a physical interface via electrodes that based on invasiveness can be discriminated into either implantable (applied directly at the brain/muscle/nerve) or surface (applied on the skin) devices [102]. Human-robot interfaces (HRIs) are interfacing the human (brain, muscle, and nerves) with a device by acquiring biological signals, decoding them, and translating them to control commands for various assistive, rehabilitation, or prosthetic devices.

(p15.0) Stroke patients who receive electromechanical gait training assistance in addition to physiotherapy are more likely to achieve independent walking [154]. Some of the roadblocks remaining for developing commercially successful lower limb (LL) exoskeletons are human-machine interface compliance, the optimization of the control algorithms, and the smooth coordination with the physiology of the human body with low metabolic energy expenditure [155].
## (s18) Technological Challenges of Neuroprosthetics

(p18.0) The purpose of controlled neuroprosthetics is to transfer control intent from the central nervous system to drive the prosthetic devices of users with immobilized body parts [168]. Such control generally requires high levels of concentration by the patient and long training periods, often resulting in high rejection rates of prosthetics [129]. To accomplish robust control, there are two main challenges: (1) development of neural interfaces that last a long period, and (2) skillful control of the prosthetic device comparable to natural movements [168]. Up-to-date hand prostheses are actuated by advanced motors, allowing the restoration of fine motor skills with direct muscular signals connection [169]. In the long run, the goal is to accomplish a quantum-leap advance in neural controllable degrees of autonomy that should permit the user to perform tasks of daily living without effort [168]. Some points to consider regarding control and feedback are the location of the interface with the CNS and the PNS, as well as the invasiveness of the interface, from noninvasive interfaces to the most invasive interfaces requiring surgical implantation [170]. Surgical procedures, such as targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) [171][172][173] and osseointegration [174], greatly improved PNS signal decoding and subsequently improved prosthetic control, as well as the donning/doffing and stability of the prosthetic fixture. In TMSR, motor and sensory nerves of a severed limb are surgically rerouted to reinnervate regions of large intact muscles (the pectoralis for the upper extremity and the hamstring for the lower extremity [171][172][173]). Osseointegration is a surgical procedure where a load-bearing implant is directly integrated with the residual bone of the amputee to improve prosthetic connection and sensory feedback [174].

(p22.0) Human-robot interaction (HRI) is a diverse research and development field that involves artificial intelligence, robotics, and the social sciences for the purpose of interaction and communication between humans and robots. It has a wide range of applications, such as industrial robots, medical robots, social robots, automated driving, search and rescue, and several more [216,217]. In this paper, the focus of HRI is on medical robots and, more specifically, in those employed for neural rehabilitation applications.
