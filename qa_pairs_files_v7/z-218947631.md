(p10.0) Multimodal authentication systems have become increasingly popular since relying on multiple modalities on offer robust and accurate results in comparison to unimodal systems, that consider only a single biometric modality. Such systems offer hardened security, especially against adversarial attacks, and deliver a flexible method for authentication considering possible changes of the input data that result in problems in the enrollment and validation phase [87], [177].
