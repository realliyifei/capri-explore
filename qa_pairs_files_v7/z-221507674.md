## (s2) A. Aphasia
Number of References: 2

(p2.0) Aphasia is a disorder that affects the comprehension and formulation of language and is caused by damage to the areas of the brain involved in language [49]. People with aphasia have difficulties with understanding, speaking, reading or writing, but their intelligence is normally unaffected. For instance, aphasic patients struggle in retrieving the words they want to say, a condition known as anomia. The opposite mental process, i.e., the transformation of messages heard or read into an internal message, is also affected in aphasia. Aphasia affects not only spoken but also written communication (reading/writing) and visual language (e.g., sign languages) [49].
## (s10) B. Muscle activity

(p10.0) As shown in Fig. 1, during speech production the muscles in the face and larynx are responsible for the movements that will eventually result in the production of the acoustic signal. As mentioned above, the brain controls the activation of these muscles by means of electrical signals transmitted through the motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system. These electrical signals cause muscles to contract and relax, thus producing the required articulatory movements and gestures. EMG measures the electrical potentials generated by depolarisation of the external membrane of the muscle fibres in response to the stimulation of the muscles by the motor neurons [212]. The EMG signal resulting from the application of this technique is complex and dependent on the anatomical and physiological properties of the muscles [213].
