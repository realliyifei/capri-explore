(p7.0) IgE is a key mediator in several allergic reactions involving type I hypersensitivity mechanism. Thus, the invention of omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG antibody [81], has provided a breakthrough in clinical practice for IgE-mediated diseases including allergic asthma. In RCTs of adult patients with moderate or severe allergic asthma, omalizumab add-on therapy significantly improved asthma outcomes such as exacerbation and hospitalization rates, compared to placebo [82]. However, elderly asthma patients are frequently nonatopic (also called as "intrinsic asthma") [2]; thus, the efficacy of omalizumab may be questioned in these patients.
