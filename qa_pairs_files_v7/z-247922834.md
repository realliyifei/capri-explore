(p0.0) Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning whose goal is to find the underlying structure composed of clusters (groups or categories) in which objects or observations belonging to each cluster should share some relevant property (similarity) regarding the data domain. Clustering analysis is widely adopted in different fields of application (e.g. marketing, medicine, bioinformatics) considering different research subjects, such as pattern analysis, decision making, data mining, and image segmentation [49,60].
