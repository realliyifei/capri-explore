(p0.0) Deprescribing is defined as the act of reducing the dose or stopping medications that are deemed inappropriate in order to reduce polypharmacy and improve health outcomes. 1As older adults are likely to take several medications concurrently, deprescribing is a relevant intervention to optimize their medication use.However, the lack of robust evidence is often identified as a barrier to the implementation of deprescribing in primary care. 2 Therefore, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of deprescribing studies can play a significant role in filling the knowledge gap and facilitating the integration of this practice into healthcare.
