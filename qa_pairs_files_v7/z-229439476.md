## (s17) 5G MIMO Signals over Fibre
Number of References: 4

(p17.0) It is observed that 5G network technology would enable 20 Gb/s peak rate per cell and 1000 times data traffic compared to the existing 4G LTE [94]. 5G systems can support MIMO technology, enhancing the spectral efficiency and satisfying the high data rate requirements for today's mobile devices [67]. Moreover, the RoF is the qualifying technology for the future 5G cellular networks [95,96], which can be used in combination with the MIMO technology.
