(p8.0) Liquid desiccant solutions could be employed as a potential alternative strategy for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 or other airborne pathogens in buildings, enclosed spaces or public transports. Liquid desiccant is a technology that uses hygroscopic solutions, usually LiCl, LiBr, CaCl 2 , HCO 2 K, TEG, etc., to dehumidify the air [12]. A schematic diagram of a liquid desiccant system in its conventional configuration is shown in Fig. 7, where the desiccant solution depending on its temperature and concentration is able to produce dry and hot/humid (usually as scavenging air) in the dehumidifier and regenerator, respectively.
