(p6.0) Only two studies reported results for death from cardiovascular disease (N = 151 deaths) [27,112]  Increased risks of mortality were observed in the meta-analyses by menopausal status. While the summary risk estimates seem stronger with premenopausal breast cancer, there was no significant heterogeneity between pre-and post-menopausal breast cancer as shown in the meta-regression analyses (P = 0.28-0.89) (supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at Annals of Oncology online). For BMI before diagnosis and total mortality, the summary RRs for obese versus normal weight were 1.75 (95% CI 1.26-2.41, I 2 = 70%, P < 0.01, 7 studies) in women with pre-menopausal breast cancer and 1.34 (95% CI 1.18-1.53, I 2 = 27%, P = 0.20, 9 studies) in women with postmenopausal breast cancer.
