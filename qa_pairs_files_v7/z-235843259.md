(p13.0) The potential use of genetic SNP's of hormone genes as a tool to assist in predicting future athletic performance is currently an Genetic of swimming speed-related and not for strength sports. Circulating IGF2 levels were lower among individuals homozygous for the G allele [176], and higher levels of circulating IGF1 levels were found in individuals carrying the IGF2 GG genotype [177]. Thus, it is possible that the beneficial effect of the IGF2 rs680 polymorphism on speed performance is not necessarily mediated through its influence on circulating IGF2, but via its effect on IGF1 levels.

(p14.0) Myostatin belongs to the transforming growth factor Î² super-family of proteins that control tissue growth and differentiation [181,182].
