(p7.0) Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have a self-proliferation and multi-differentiation capacity (Chopra et al., 2018).In the event of tissue ischemia, EPCs in bone marrow can directly form blood vessels, differentiate into endothelial cells, and integrate with ischemic tissue to engage in the generation of new blood vessels (Sun et al., 2021b;Tani, 1990).
