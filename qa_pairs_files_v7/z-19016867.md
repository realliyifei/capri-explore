(p0.0) Salmonine fishes are experiencing many anthropogenic disturbances and may need to adapt if they are to persist. In their native range, for instance, many populations are extinct or threatened with extinction, typically due to human activities (e.g., Gustafson et al. 2007). Consequently, there is considerable interest in predicting whether and how populations (or more specifically, traits within populations) will evolve in response to these perturbations (e.g., Crozier et al. 2008). Understanding the adaptive potential of these fishes requires information on quantitative genetic parameters, which is the goal of this paper. Specifically, we reviewed estimates of two quantitative genetic parameters, heritability (h 2 ) and genetic correlation (r G ), for fitness traits for Pacific salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus spp.), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus), and the circumpolar charr (Salvelinus spp.).
