(p5.0) The recent approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway for prevention of migraine in adults has expanded and improved available options for migraine treatment. CGRP, a vasodilatory neuropeptide with multiple sites of action, has been identified as a key player in migraine pathophysiology through its involvement in nociception and sensitization of peripheral and central neurons in the trigeminovascular system [60]. CGRP is also associated with neurogenic inflammation and pronociceptive activity [61]. CGRP levels in the jugular venous blood are elevated in patients with migraine, increase during migraine attacks, and can induce migraine-like headaches in people susceptible to migraine [60,62,63]. Sumatriptan has been shown to normalize plasma CGRP levels, reinforcing the role of CGRP in migraine [64].
