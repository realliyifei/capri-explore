(p18.0) The introduction of biologics has led to a major step forward in the treatment of severe PP and PsA, and may have the potential to revolutionize the management of patients with disabling psoriatic nail disease. Anti-TNFa treatments were the first, very effective biologics that became available to psoriasis patients. More recently, other mechanisms of the psoriatic inflammatory reaction can be suppressed with anti-IL-17, and anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding for patients with moderate to severe PP or PsA who are unresponsive to conventional systemic therapies or have contraindications for these therapies. Infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab are anti-TNFa treatments available both for PP and PsA patients, while golimumab and certolizumab pegol only have registration for PsA. The biologic ustekinumab, which targets IL-12/23, and the anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab are also available for both PP and PsA. All these biologics appear to have a positive effect on nail psoriasis, without major differences in efficacy between the populations they are investigated in, i.e. PP or PsA (Table 3). In general, nail responses are slow but continue to improve, lagging behind cutaneous responses over time. While the onset of response in nail psoriasis is mostly noticeable after approximately 12 weeks, further improvement or even complete clearance can be seen through to 1 year of treatment. Nonetheless, nail, skin, and joint manifestations of psoriasis generally improved in parallel based on correlation between NAPSI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses over time. Overall, patients with greater skin or joint responses also demonstrated better nail responses. On the other hand, the presence of nail disease was not shown to predict good response of the arthritis [95], and improvement of nail psoriasis by a biologic did not depend on the presence or absence of PsA [96].

(p19.0) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

## (s21) Adalimumab
Number of References: 16

(p21.0) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.
## (s24) Certolizumab Pegol
Number of References: 16

(p24.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.

Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.
## (s65) Adalimumab
Number of References: 16

(p65.0) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

(p68.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.

(p106.0) The introduction of biologics has led to a major step forward in the treatment of severe PP and PsA, and may have the potential to revolutionize the management of patients with disabling psoriatic nail disease. Anti-TNFa treatments were the first, very effective biologics that became available to psoriasis patients. More recently, other mechanisms of the psoriatic inflammatory reaction can be suppressed with anti-IL-17, and anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding for patients with moderate to severe PP or PsA who are unresponsive to conventional systemic therapies or have contraindications for these therapies. Infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab are anti-TNFa treatments available both for PP and PsA patients, while golimumab and certolizumab pegol only have registration for PsA. The biologic ustekinumab, which targets IL-12/23, and the anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab are also available for both PP and PsA. All these biologics appear to have a positive effect on nail psoriasis, without major differences in efficacy between the populations they are investigated in, i.e. PP or PsA (Table 3). In general, nail responses are slow but continue to improve, lagging behind cutaneous responses over time. While the onset of response in nail psoriasis is mostly noticeable after approximately 12 weeks, further improvement or even complete clearance can be seen through to 1 year of treatment. Nonetheless, nail, skin, and joint manifestations of psoriasis generally improved in parallel based on correlation between NAPSI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses over time. Overall, patients with greater skin or joint responses also demonstrated better nail responses. On the other hand, the presence of nail disease was not shown to predict good response of the arthritis [95], and improvement of nail psoriasis by a biologic did not depend on the presence or absence of PsA [96].

(p107.0) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

The biologic ustekinumab, which targets IL-12/23, and the anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab are also available for both PP and PsA. All these biologics appear to have a positive effect on nail psoriasis, without major differences in efficacy between the populations they are investigated in, i.e. PP or PsA (Table 3). In general, nail responses are slow but continue to improve, lagging behind cutaneous responses over time. While the onset of response in nail psoriasis is mostly noticeable after approximately 12 weeks, further improvement or even complete clearance can be seen through to 1 year of treatment. Nonetheless, nail, skin, and joint manifestations of psoriasis generally improved in parallel based on correlation between NAPSI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses over time. Overall, patients with greater skin or joint responses also demonstrated better nail responses. On the other hand, the presence of nail disease was not shown to predict good response of the arthritis [95], and improvement of nail psoriasis by a biologic did not depend on the presence or absence of PsA [96].

(p151.0) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

## (s153) Adalimumab
Number of References: 16

(p153.0) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

Number of References: 16

(p156.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.
