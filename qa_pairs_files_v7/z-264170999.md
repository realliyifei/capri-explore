(p6.0) EF and FP independently appraised the captured systematic reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool, which has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and construct validity. 17In assessing the overall quality of individual studies, more weight was given to the AMSTAR 2 critical domains (ie, 7 out 16 items). 17About the protocol domain, an explicit statement was required that the methods had been established prior to conducting the systematic review and/or that PRISMA guidelines 16 or those for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies 18 had been adhered to, and/or that any deviations from protocol had been reported.
