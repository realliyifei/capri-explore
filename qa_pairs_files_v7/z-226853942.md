(p5.0) Consider a scenario similar to the previous one, but now with a massive-MIMO BS with M antennas transmitting to users equipped with N antennas. The users are also grouped into L clusters, each of which with K users, all with different channel matrices, however, they all share the same spatial correlation matrix R l . In such cases one can apply the Karhunen-Lo√®ve channel decomposition [34,35], according to which the k-th user in the l-th cluster can have its channel matrix written as:
