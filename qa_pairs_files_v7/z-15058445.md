(p0.0) Nervous system disorders continue to challenge the medical genomics of rare Mendelian mutation identification. Two examples in which exome sequencing has proven successful are the new neuroectodermal CHIME (C oloboma, H eart defects, Ichthyosiform dermatosis, Mental retardation, Ear anomalies with hearing loss) syndrome that is "presumed to be an autosomal recessive disorder because of recurrence in sibs" [26], and the Joubert syndrome, a disorder in which, for the majority of subjects, "the causal mutations have not yet been identified…" [27]. The recent 2015 French Canadian population study that utilized a combined targeted and exome sequencing approach successfully identified two non-French Canadian subjects with the CEP104 mutations of Joubert syndrome and demonstrated a 94% (n=43) prevalence of CEP104 disruption as conclusive evidence of causation "despite substantial locus and allelic [population] heterogeneity" [28].

(p1.0) Researchers investigating the peripheral neuropathy of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, the most common inherited muscular disorder [20], were faced with a population of 40 candidate genes and asserted that "linkage analysis followed by candidate gene Sanger sequencing, utilized in other studies would…have required the sequencing of at least the 78 exons" [21]. Utilizing exome sequencing, the scientists were able to rapidly identify the disorder in a previously undiagnosed family and consequently take the position that their accomplishments "support the notion that genomic approaches in GABRB3 mutations as the causative factor(s). Identified during this research study was c.860C>T (p.Thr287Ile), described as a novel de novo GABRB3 heterozygous missense mutation and implicated as an emerging causative factor in early-onset epilepsy [33].
