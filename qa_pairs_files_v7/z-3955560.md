## (s15) Plant Uptake of Selenium

(p15.0) Plants can be classified into three main groups based on the Se concentrations in their tissues; non accumulators, accumulators and hyperaccumulators. Non Se accumulating plants rarely contain greater than 50 mg kg -1 Se and often have less than 5 mg kg -1 Se in their tissues [26]. Accumulators can be further divided into two groups; primary and secondary accumulators. Primary Se accumulators grow well on soils with high available Se concentrations and contain up to 1000 mg kg -1 Se [26,118]. Secondary Se accumulators are plant species such as Atriplex, Castilleja, Grindelia, and Gutierrezia, which do not contain more than 50 to 100 mg Se kg -1 [26]. Se hyperaccumulators contain between 1000-15000 mg kg -1 Se and examples include Astragalus bisulcatus and Stanleya pinnata [119][120].

(p18.0) The conversion of SeCys to other organic species is thought to be a detoxification mechanism because it prevents the incorporation of Se into proteins [148]. High concentrations of the methylated organic Se species, SeMeCys, were present in the young leaves of the Se hyperaccumulator, Astragalus bisulcatus, suggesting that this might be a detoxification mechanism in the hyperaccumulator [149].
