## (s2) Auxin
Number of References: 12

(p2.0) Auxin is a plant hormone that widely regulates plant development, but its role in stomatal development was reported only recently [60][61][62][63]. An interesting timelapse experiment reveals that auxin activity changes over stomatal development [58]. Auxin activity is high in early stages but depleted from GMCs, probably via its efflux transporter PIN FORMED3 (PIN3), based on the strong expression of PIN3 in late meristemoids. In pin higher-order mutants or when PIN3 trafficking is interfered with, stomata form clusters, suggesting on-time exporting of auxin from meristemoids is critical for stomatal patterning [60].
