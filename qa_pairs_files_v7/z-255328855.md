(p1.0) The human gut microbiota formation begins immediately after birth and is shaped during the first few years of life [3,9]. Some research suggests that it starts even earlier, and the transition of maternal bacteria to the fetus may take place during pregnancy [10]. It is presumed that gut microbiota stabilizes and becomes similar to that of adults at the age of 3 years [11,12]; however, recent findings indicate that its development in some children may take longer [9].
