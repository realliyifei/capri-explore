(p16.0) Despite their generally anti-inflammatory effects, glucocorticoids appear to act in a biphasic manner. Low doses of endogenous glucocorticoids, or exposure to this hormone without an additional inflammatory stimulus, can enhance pathways involved in the innate immune response by up-regulating PRRs, cytokine receptors and complement factors. This includes aiding differentiation of macrophages, promoting phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and debris by monocytes and macrophages, and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion [155]. Expression of pro-and anti-inflammatory genes are regulated via NF-κB and AP-1 or by post-translational protein modification [155]. In contrast, glucocorticoids exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, impairing phagocytosis in macrophages, increasing apoptosis of neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils, and decreasing antigen presentation and co-stimulation by dendritic cells which will ultimately affect the adaptive immune system [155][156][157].

(p17.0) Glucocorticoids regulate adaptive immunity by inhibiting lymphocyte activation and promoting lymphocyte apoptosis, events also observed in sepsis [156,157]. At high concentrations, B-and T-cell production is also inhibited [157]. Glucocorticoids inhibit pro-inflammatory genes involved in adaptive immunity and also dampen signals downstream of PRRs, cytokine receptors and Fcε receptors. They inhibit expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules that curtail inflammation and reduce leukocyte recruitment [179][180][181][182], directly suppress CD4 + T-cell activation and favour differentiation of T-cells into Th2 and Treg cells over Th1 and Th17 cells.
