## (s13) Measurement Feasibility of Different Animal-Based Indicators
Number of References: 3

(p13.0) In pursuit of PLF and animal welfare, an ideal measurement method for heat strainrelated data should be automatic, accurate, continuous, remote, non-invasive, low-cost, and real-time [14,99,100]. Non-contact measurements based on infrared thermometry are non-invasive to dairy cows but difficult to achieve real-time measurement at the herd level. They are more suitable for monitoring at specific locations such as calf islands, calf feeders, and milking parlors.
