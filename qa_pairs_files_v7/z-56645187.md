(p3.0) In the three studies using the oxidative stress model, Jung et al. found that idesolide extract protected muscle cells from oxidative stress by promoting the activation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the cells [42]. HSP70 protects cells from a number of apoptotic stimuli, including oxidative stress and is significantly downregulated in various models of skeletal muscle atrophy [52]. They also found the same effects when sauchinone (root of Saururus chinensis) was used as the mode of treatment [44].
