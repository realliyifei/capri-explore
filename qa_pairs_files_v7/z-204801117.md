(p17.0) With Brooksbank and Ferrara, we decided to investigate the orthogonal groups and to look for string C-group representations of large rank. Indeed, apart from the symmetric and alternating groups, as well as some crystallographic groups studied by Barry Monson and Egon Schulte (see [46,47,48]), no other family of groups was known to have possible large ranks that could grow linearly depending on one of its parameters, being the permutation degree or the dimension of the group or the size of the field on which the group is defined. We obtained the following theorem for orthogonal and symplectic groups. Given the way we had to choose the involutions to construct the string C-group representations mentioned in Theorem 8.1, we have good reasons to believe that no higher rank can be achieved for these groups.
