## (s26) Results for twisted and untwisted finite-temperature form factors
Number of References: 2

(p26.0) Again, we repeat here the results of [2], and generalise them to the twisted case. Note that the method of computing one-particle finite-temperature form factors by solving the Riemann-Hilbert problem with this asymptotic is very similar to the method used by Fonseca and Zamolodchikov [21] for calculating form factors on the circle.
