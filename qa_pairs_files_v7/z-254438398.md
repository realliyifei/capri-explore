Number of References: 2

(p23.0) Learning from demonstration (LFD) that could be implemented through kinesthetic teaching, teleoperation, and passive observation is a robot learning method in that the robot learns to do a task by imitating a demonstrator. This method could be considered a supervised learning method, since an expert and a robot provide the information that the tries to follow. In this robot-learning method, even non-experts could interact with the robot, learning could be done using a small number of demonstrations (i.e., data efficiency), robot learning is done in a safe condition, it is a reliable method, and the learned task could be implemented in a different platform (i.e., platform independence). However, there are some limitations, including that it is difficult to demonstrate complex behaviors, labeled data are needed, and learning from sub-optimal and inappropriate demonstrators would not be accurate [66], [67].
