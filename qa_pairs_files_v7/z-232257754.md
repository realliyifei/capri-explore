(p0.0) Deep convoluIonal neural networks (DCNN) have revoluIonized computer vision. DCNNs reach near or even super-human performance in many tasks, such as image classificaIon (He et al., 2016), image segmentaIon (He et al., 2017), image capIoning (Karpathy & Fei-Fei, 2015), and image generaIon (Choi et al., 2020). There is now a fierce debate whether DCNNs are also a good model for the human visual system. On the one hand, proponents argue that DCNNs perform like humans in many object recogniIon tasks, and their architecture indeed resembles the human one (Kubilius et al., 2018;Schrimpf et al., 2020). On the other hand, DCNNs o[en solve vision tasks very differently than humans (Geirhos et al., 2020), indicaIng that comparable performance levels per se do not tell whether DCNNs are good models.
