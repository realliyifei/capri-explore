## (s12) Effects of Nutrients on Transcription Factors Gene Expression
Number of References: 2

(p12.0) The expression, and consequently the action, of transcription factors depend on the animals' physiological conditions and developmental stage, whereby the corresponding genes are expressed only at the appropriate times. In addition, definite nutrients, such as long-chain fatty acids, are able to regulate the expression of transcription factors. According to Bionaz et al. [111], several fatty acids might, to varying degrees, activate various PPAR isotypes, with PUFAs showing more affinity for PPARÎ±, which is encoded by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) gene [134].
