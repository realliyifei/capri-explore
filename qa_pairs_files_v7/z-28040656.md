(p11.0) It is not hard to show, by using Edmonds' matching polytope theorem [25], that the edges of any bridgeless cubic graph of order n can be obtained as union of log(n) perfect matchings. As far as we know, the best bound known (still logarithmic in the order of G) is the one given by Mazzuoccolo in [87] as a corollary of the technique introduced by Kaiser, Kr√°l and Norine in [67].
