(p22.0) Different approaches explained in Section V are compared and discussed here in relation to the way they facilitate a two-sided market implementation. The efficient integration of end-users in a two-sided market allows to exploit their capabilities and provides value streams for them and the power network. Though DR programs enable exploiting flexibility of demand-side for providing different services, there are many barriers which prevent the full potential of DR being realized, including economic, social, technological, and regulatory issues. These programs are usually concentrated on the consumption part of the network and neglect the importance of active participation of the supply-side. DR programs rely on scheduling flexible demands of end-users, and hence, they would affect the comfort level of energy consumers. Though negawatt trading enables end-users to participate in a two-sided market taking into account their preferences, uncoordinated operation of flexible end-users hinders to unlock their potential values for the network. More details on challenges and barriers in implementing DR programs and negawatt trading can be found in [15], and [56].
