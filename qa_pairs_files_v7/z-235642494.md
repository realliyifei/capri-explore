## (s12) Fusobacterium nucleatum

(p12.0) Fusobacterium nucleatum are anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria that were first isolated from the oral cavity. With the advent of gut microbiome profiling, it was discovered that the bacteria can also colonize human intestines [119]; nevertheless, the movement of F. nucleatum from the mouth to colon remains unclear. In 2013, Kostic et al. proved that infection by F. nucleatum increases tumor cell multiplicity and recruits tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in an in vivo model. Accordingly, carcinogenic properties of the bacteria were then reported, where the bacteria were found to enhance the proliferation of normal human colon cells, subsequently triggering the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway [120].
## (s18) Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV)/Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)

(p18.0) Following the discovery of its genome sequences in biopsies, KSHV was identified as the causative agent for KS (IARC Class I carcinogen) [167]. The virus is a gammaherpesvirus with five major subtypes (A, A5, B, C, and D). Interestingly, the virus encodes proteins homologous to its human host, such as cyclin, viral FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP), B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), IL-6, interferon regulatory factors, and chemokines, where viral cyclin and vFLIP promote the proliferation of infected tumor cells during latent infection [164]. Besides KS, KSHV is also associated with Castleman's disease and primary effusion lymphoma, both neoplasms of the lymphatic system.
