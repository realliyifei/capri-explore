(p7.0) Regardless of the extensive literature concerning kdr mutations and their association with resistance to insecticides, few reports have presented their impact on malaria transmission dynamics, i.e., on the ability of mosquitoes to transmit malaria. Infection rate and oocyst burden are two of the five factors that determine the vectorial capacity of mosquitoes [163]. The response to Plasmodium exposure in vectors is modulated by the mosquito's innate immune system. In A. gambiae, for example, changes in its global gene expression patterns are expressed upon Plasmodium infection [164]. Exposure to pyrethroids, in turn, induces metabolic changes that alters the immune response [165] and may therefore affect the outcome of Plasmodium infection.

(p7.1) An insecticide susceptible strain of A. funestus showed greater ability to become infected with Plasmodium berghei than its resistant counterpart [166]. In A. gambiae, infection with this same parasite increased the expression level of CYP6M2, a gene related with metabolic resistance [164]. In relation to the possible impacts of kdr mutation on vector competence, few records are available and are sometimes conflicting. For instance, neither positive or negative correlation was found between the occurrence of kdr and ace-1 R alleles with infection of Plasmodium falciparum in A. gambiae natural populations from Benin [109].

(p7.2) Other studies, however, showed that the presence of both resistant alleles could be associated with increased prevalence of Plasmodium infection in an A. gambiae resistant strain. Additionally, individuals carrying the kdr mutation had increased prevalence of sporozoites, which is likely to  Allele-Specific Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (AS-LAMP) Turbidimeter and water bath L1014F [172] Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism assay (PCR-RFLP) PCR thermocycler L1014F/C [141] Primer Introduced Restriction Analysis-PCR assay (PIRA-PCR) PCR thermocycler, electrophoresis and imaging equipments L1014F/S [173] Multiplex Primer Introduced Restriction Analysis-PCR assay (mPIRA-PCR) PCR thermocycler and electrophoresis equipments L1014F/S [174] Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR thermocycler, electrophoresis and imaging equipments L1014F [151] impact on parasite transmission [167]. Given the dissemination of kdr mutation in natural populations, similar studies should be conducted in order to better understand the impact of insecticide resistance on vector competence.
