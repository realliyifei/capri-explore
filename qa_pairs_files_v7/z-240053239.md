## (s10) The Potential Therapeutic Role of ACE2 in COVID-19
Number of References: 7

(p10.0) Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine for COVID-19. According to statistics, the mortality rate of severe COVID-19 patients is as high as 22-44% [72,167]. There is an urgent need for more effective treatments in the clinic. ACE2, as a binding protein of SARS-CoV2, not only plays a vital role in viral infection [168,169], but its dysfunction also leads to the weakness of the inflammatory inhibitory effect of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MASR axis, resulting in the aggravation of lung injury [170]. In addition, ACE2 is also a receptor protein for SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Considering the potential treatment of ACE2-mediated COVID-19, some feasible treatments will be very important [171,172]. Therefore, ACE2 may play a certain therapeutic role on COVID-19 (Table 1).
