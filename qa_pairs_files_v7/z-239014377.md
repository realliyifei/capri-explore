(p0.0) The globalised world today demands speedy and efficient handling of every action [1]- [3]. The fastmoving actions are essential in ensuring that the services can be implemented in line with the rapid development of technology and information, including in the legal system [4]- [20]. Judges and lawyers generally handle legal cases, but the help of technology is critically essential due to the massive numbers of cases daily. The effect of 'delay in justice' may lead to various consequences, such as witness hostility, unfitness of the plaintiff or accused and other adverse impacts [21].
## (s1) METHOD 2.1. The review protocol-ROSES
Number of References: 4

(p1.0) The ROSES review protocol lead the current research. The ROSES protocol is developed for systematic review and environment management field maps [34]- [45]. Additionally, the ROSES protocol also encourages researchers to guarantee that they offer the correct information with explicit details. The researchers began the SLR by formulating research questions according to the review's protocol [46]- [48]. Subsequently, the researchers were required to describe the systematic searching strategy that consists of three processes, such as identification, screening and eligibility. the researchers were also required to perform a quality appraisal of the selected articles. Lastly, the authors elaborated on the outcomes generated from the chosen principal articles.
