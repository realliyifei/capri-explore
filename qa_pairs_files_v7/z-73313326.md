(p8.0) Some surgeons advocate local anaesthetic infiltration around the wound site.They advocate that this provides pain control immediately after an operation and during defecation when the patient will experience most pain.Moriasaki et al. 27 and Ho et al. 28 showed that LA infiltration reduced post-operative haemorrhoidectomy pain.However, the discomfort associated with the administration of local anaesthetic into the perineum limits its use, unless co-existing analgesia is used.There is also concern that this only provides short term pain-relief for 12-18 h and will subsequently other forms of analgesia will be needed in the long-term.
