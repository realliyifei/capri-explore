## (s7) Epigenetic interlinking between malignancies and SARS-CoV-2
Number of References: 27

(p7.0) Tremendous progress in sequencing-based technologies has made it possible to detect neoplasm specific epigenetic signatures and epigenetic heterogeneity which are mostly observed in solid tumors [72]. Using suitable controls and genome-wide profiling, cancer-associated changes of DNA methylation, global hypomethylation, and focal hypermethylation were determined as early marks in tumorigenesis. Alterations accumulating in the epigenome can therefore be used to predict cancer risks. [73,74].

(p9.0) Yao et al. conducted a study to elucidate the regulatory effect of chromosome 3p21.31 (genetic susceptibility locus for COVID-19) [81] in immune cell lines (THP-1, HL-60, Jurkat, and K562 resembling human monocytes, promyelocyte, T lymphocytes, and erythroid respectively) [18]. With CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genomic deletion, CCR9 and SLC6A20 were found to be target genes in the locus. Their investigation revealed six fine-mapped variants (rs34326463, rs76374459, rs73064425, rs13081482, rs35652899, and rs35044562) overlapping human T-cell specific primed enhancers. These findings insinuate of an epigenetic regulatory mechanism that can influence the T cell functions towards SARS-Cov-2 infection [18].

(p9.1) IL-6 can regulate the expression and functions of multiple genes by inhibiting methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3B [19,20]. In inflammation-induced ARDS, [82] IL-6 is activated in dendritic cells by the acetylation of transcription factor KLF4 [83]. A combination of epigenetic phosphorylation and acetylation marks on Herpes virus encoded viral IL-6 can induce STAT3 activity [84]. All these prior studies strengthen the assumption that IL-6 may be epigenetically altered in case of COVID-19 infection. To test such assumption, using Chip-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets from 839 and 157 cell/tissue types of humans and mice through ENCODE respectively (https://www.encodeproject.org/) [85]; Sang et al. discovered significant comparative existence of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac markers between IL-6 and ACE2 gene promoters in various humans and mouse samples. Interestingly, such epigenetic enrichment were found in greater quantity in these human genes compared to their mouse orthologs. In both distal and proximal regions of the hACE2 (Human ACE2) gene promoters, 2-3-fold more positive histone modifications marking insinuate of higher ACE2 activation and transcription compared to their mouse counterparts. According to their findings, elevated expression of non-ISGs (Interferon Stimulated Genes) such as IL-6 and ACE2 could be biomarkers for the exacerbation of inflammation underlying some viral infections, especially those similar to SARS-CoV-2, which dysregulate the physiological function of ACE2 in the RAAS-centric body system [76].

(p13.0) After ensuring the cancer patient group as a priority group for vaccination, an inequitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines should also be maintained, especially in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). A global system like COVAX is trying to ensure unbiased vaccine distribution in LMICs but only can cover 20% of the populations of recipient countries [108]. To understand more about the implication of COVID-19 on the vulnerable malignancy patients, COVID-19 and Cancer Taskforce commenced the investigation into the current global availability of COVID-19 vaccines and the variety of national strategies for covering cancer patients and health-care workers till March 31, 2021 [109]. A diversified global picture ranging from well-advanced vaccination programs for patients with cancer (UK) to countries without any vaccine supplies (Iraq and Guatemala) came into being by the Taskforce's reports. Another mentionable finding is the variability seen among countries on the mass vaccination campaigns in terms of planning, procurement, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Of the 29 countries with access to any type of COVID-19 vaccine, patients with cancer are prioritized only in 9 (26%). Regrettably, with mentionable exception as the VOICE, a multi-center, multi-cohort study based in Netherland which consist of patients with solid malignancies receiving active anticancer treatment who have been vaccinated against COVID-19; very few national systemic data collection from patients with cancer receiving COVID-19 vaccines exist [110]. The inability to access vaccines is the single most cataclysmic obstacle to receive vaccines for many patients with cancer in some of the most vulnerable settings. But lack of proper management and failure in inclusiveness of cancer patients in mass vaccination campaigns are found to exist in well-resourced health systems too. Prioritized, fast COVID-19 vaccination of health-care workers and cancer patients is indispensable to alleviate the existing delay in providing proper cancer treatment.
