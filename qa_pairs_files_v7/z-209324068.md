(p23.0) Fuzzing of software security is one of the state of art techniques that people use to detect software vulnerabilities. The goal of fuzzing is to find all the vulnerabilities exist in the program by testing as much program code as possible. Due to the nature of fuzzing, this technique works best on finding vulnerabilities in programs that take in input files, like PDF viewers [52] or web browsers. A typical workflow of fuzzing can be concluded as: given several seed input files, the fuzzer will mutate or fuzz the seed inputs to get more input files, with the aim of expanding the overall code coverage of the target program as it executes the mutated files. Although there have already been various popular fuzzers [66], fuzzing still cannot bypass its problem of sometimes redundantly testing input files which cannot improve the code coverage rate [50,53]. Some input files mutated by the fuzzer even cannot pass the well-formed file structure test [52]. Recent research has come up with ideas of applying Deep Learning in the process of fuzzing to solve these problems.
