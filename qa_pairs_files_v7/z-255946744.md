(p6.0) The vegetation index (VI) is the integration of spectral data from two or more bands after a certain mathematical transformation [32]. Researchers usually establish mathematical prediction models by calculating the spectral value of the sensitive wavelength or by calculating and optimizing vegetation indices defined in botany.
## (s12) Detection of architecture parameters
Number of References: 2

(p12.0) Digital image has high image resolution, which is valuable for the calculation of canopy architecture parameters. The architecture parameters include tree height, crown diameter, crown volume (C v ), leaf area (LA) and LAI. LAI is the total one-sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area [54], it can be regarded as a reliable basis for pruning branches and leaves, to improve light transmittance and promote the growth of branches and leaves.
## (s15) The principle of multispectral and hyperspectral imaging

(p15.0) The visible to long-wave infrared spectral spectrum (0.4-14 µm) is commonly used in scientific research. The electromagnetic waves in this band can be divided into four categories: VIS band (400-700 nm), NIR band (700-1000 nm), short-wave infrared band (1000-2500 nm) and long-wave infrared band (7.5-14 µm) [68].

Number of References: 8

(p19.0) The experiments of fruit detection using spectral imaging are mainly carried out in the laboratory under controlled conditions including illumination, temperature, and distance [84][85][86]. Fruits were tested separately, which would take a long time when there are a large number of samples. Recently, on-the-go spectral imaging devices have been successfully applied in fruit detection [87].
