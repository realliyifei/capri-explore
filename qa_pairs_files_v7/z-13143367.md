(p25.0) This theorem can be transformed into a colouring algorithm [65] that generalizes several well known algorithms for colouring classes of perfect graphs, such as Meyniel graphs and weakly chordal graphs. It yields a combinatorial polynomial time colouring algorithm for perfectly orderable graphs (none was known before). The proof of the next theorem from [24] uses some technics of the proof of Theorem 11.3, is very readable, and as we will see saves about 50 pages in the proof of the SPGT. An odd wheel (C, T ) in a graph G consists of a hole C of length at least six, and a nonempty anticonnected subset T âŠ† V (G) \ V (C), such that at least three vertices of C are T -complete, and there is a path P of C with odd length at least 3, such that its ends are not T -complete and all its internal vertices are T -complete. A long prism is a prism such that at least one the paths has length at least 2. Let us say that G is impoverished if G is Berge, and G and G both contain no odd wheel, long prism or double diamond. A dominant pair in G is a pair (x, y) of nonadjacent vertices such that every other vertex of G is adjacent to at least one of x, y.
