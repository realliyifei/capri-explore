## (s10) Assessing Urban Trees Numerical Parameters Without Measurements

(p10.0) LAI and LAD are the main foliage parameters needed to model radiation through a tree a canopy and between a tree and its environment. It can be estimated utilizing field measurement or using instruments and empirical models. There is lack of research concerning LAI and trees modeling in hot regions, as well as, the urban trees modeling to access their thermal effect in contact with buildings in hot arid regions. Hence, there is an urge need to model trees even without LAI or LAD sources for specific species, and it is essential to know the preferred LAI of tree to produce maximum shadow at peak hour of a mid-latitude site. following Lalic et al. [69], Fahmy et al. [61] developed an empirical method to model LAD values of a mid-latitude urban tree and its effects at peak time without the need to measure LAI which is an essential parameter to introduce trees LAD foliage values to the vegetation database of ENVI-met microclimate CFD model [70].
