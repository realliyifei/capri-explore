(p4.0) Two different study groups conducted similar meta-analyses in 2018 to explore the association of galectin-9 expression with prognosis in patients with solid tumors [14,15]. However, their   Zhou X et al. also reported a significant association of high galectin-9 expression with better clinicopathological characteristics of solid tumors, including less invasion and absence of lymph node or distal tumor metastasis [15].

(p21.0) Three meta-analyses evaluated the diagnostic value of galectins alone or in combination with pulsatility index for preeclampsia (Table 3) [34][35][36].

(p21.1) Two different study groups published similar meta-analyses in 2015 to explore the diagnostic accuracy of galectin-13 alone for preeclampsia [34,35]. Wu P et al. identified nine studies exploring the role of galectin-13, also known as placental protein 13, for diagnosis of preeclampsia [34]. The AUC was 0.882, sensitivity 37%, and specificity 88%. In another meta-analysis by Zhong Y et al., the sensitivity and specificity of galectin-13 were 47% and 89% for early preeclampsia, 60% and 78% for early preeclampsia, 36% and 90% for small for gestational age, and 51% and 88% for preterm delivery, respectively [35].
