(p18.0) Genetic analyses have revolutionised our capability to study effective dispersal through waterbird vectors, by detecting colonisation routes and quantifying gene flow. In many genetic studies of aquatic plants and invertebrates, high levels of gene flow are detected which support an influence of bird movements. For example, van Leeuwen et al. (2013) demonstrated high rates of genetic interchange for Spanish populations of the alien aquatic snail Physella acuta, for which waterbird endozoochory has since been confirmed (Martín-Vélez et al., 2022). Martin et al. (2020) found that the population structure of the gastropod Planorbella trivolvis suggested LDD along a migratory flyway. Likewise, variation in mitochondrial clades of brine shrimp Artemia franciscana across the Americas is related to shorebird flyways (Muñoz et al., 2013). For cladocerans and the bryozoan Cristatella mucedo, Figuerola et al. (2005) found that waterfowl movements explained a significant amount of gene flow across North America.
