(p7.0) To date, neuromodulation approaches, i.e., FES-NIBS, are valid tools to improve stroke rehabilitation outcomes. In addition, BCI systems could support motor function enhancement by providing visual/somatosensory feedback (Pillette et al., 2020), whereas EEG could provide real-time brain rhythms feedback (Enriquez-Geppert et al., 2017). The high reproducibility of ERD/ERS could be considered a promising predictive outcome measure for evaluating patients with stroke recovery after rehabilitation.
