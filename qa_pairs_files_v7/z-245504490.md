(p14.0) Other manifestations evaluated included various PROs (pain, fatigue, PtGA, and Health Assessment Questionnaire), PGA, hand and grip strength, uveitis, CRP levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, DAS28, oligoarthritis, and body composition (Fig. 2). There were no studies that solely focused on differences in PROs between patients with SpA and RA; however, of the ten studies that incorporated PROs and other outcomes in their analyses among patients with SpA and RA, one concluded that there was no difference in PGA and PtGA among those with RA and AS (Table 3) [62]. Patients with PsA had significantly increased body mass index, waist circumference, and hip circumference vs. those with seropositive RA but not seronegative RA [35]. Anterior uveitis was exclusively observed in patients with AS vs. RA [53]. Patients with RA presented with worse mean hand grip strength than those with PsA [42,58].
