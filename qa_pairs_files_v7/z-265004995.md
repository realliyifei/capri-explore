(p96.0) 4][45] The upregulated synthesis of inflammatory mediators results from the activation and enhanced activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2 enzymes, and pyrogenic cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin (IL-6), among others. 9,46herefore, to qualify as an anti-inflammatory agent in an in vivo assay, it should alter the effects of carrageenan-induced inflammation, leading to the alleviation of typical features such as redness, oedema, pyrexia, algesia, and tissue dysfunction. 46,47e results of the studies indicate that the polyherbal medicines investigated possess anti-inflammatory activities, with some of these remedies used in wound and diabetes management.Phytexponent, a polyherbal medicine used for pain and inflammation treatment, was examined for its anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced paw oedema mice.The study found that Phytexponent demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in a time-dependent manner, with greater efficacy at 250 mg/Kg BW than the positive control indomethacin (4 mg/Kg BW).The polyherbal medicine also significantly reduced oedema in a dose-and time-dependent manner, and it effectively inhibited both the early and late phases of inflammation.
