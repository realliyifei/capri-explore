## (s42) Tests and Screening

(p42.0) Policy measures regarding minimal interventions (screening and brief interventions) to control gambling and related harm are most likely effective [34]. However, many barriers intervene: lack of time, skills, motivation, and organizational factors. Policies and guidelines should promote the use of these interventions and training should support professionals. These interventions are more effective when combined with specific training, such as training targeted at gambling venue employees (see previous section), general practitioners [34], or nurses of geriatric patients [30]. Otherwise, staff and professionals may have difficulties in identifying indicators of problematic gamblers, and most of all may be reluctant to intervene [37].
## (s47) Limitations
Number of References: 2

(p47.0) The review presents some limitations related to the methodology used. For an umbrella review to be useful requires the pre-existence of the narrower component reviews and its output is inevitably limited by the content of the included reviews and the level of synthesis provided. Moreover, it does not include statistical processing typical of meta-analyses to assess the results. However, its ability to synthesize the evidence across a breadth of literature offers a good overview and several recommendations [3,23].
