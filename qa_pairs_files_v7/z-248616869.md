(p0.0) The theory of exponential families has received a great deal of attention in the classical probability and statistical literature and it remains a very interesting topic. This is in particular due to the fact that the most common distributions belong either to natural exponential families (NEFs) or to general exponential families. The notion of variance function is a fundamental concept in the theory of NEFs and many classifications of NEFs by the form of their variance function has been realized. The most important classes on R are the quadratic class of NEFs such that the variance function is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to two characterized by Morris [28] and the cubic class of NEFs such that the variance function is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to three characterized by Letac and Mora [25]. The multivariate version of the quadratic and cubic NEF's have been respectively described by Casalis [12] and Hassairi [23].
