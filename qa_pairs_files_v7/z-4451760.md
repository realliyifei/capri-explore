(p8.0) Cyclic and strongly cyclic regular languages are two classes of regular languages related to symbolic dynamic and first studied in [1]. It was shown in [5] that an appropriate notion of chains suffices to characterise the difference hierarchy based on the class of strongly cyclic regular languages. This contrasts with Section 7, in which the general results on chain did not lead to a full characterization of difference hierarchies.

(p9.0) Difference hierarchies of regular languages form an appealing measure of complexity. They can be studied from the viewpoint of descriptive set theory and automata theory [11] or from an algebraic perspective, as presented in this paper. It would be interesting to compare these two approaches. The results proposed by Glasser, Schmitz and Selivanov [11], together with our new result on group languages, give hope that more decidability results might be obtained in a near future. In particular, the recent progress on concatenation hierarchies [21,23,24], might lead to new decidability results for the difference hierarchies induced by the lower levels of the Straubing-Th√©rien hierarchy.
