(p13.0) Although the mechanism by which mycotoxins influence child growth is yet to be fully understood, Smith et al. [151] suggested two possible pathways by which these toxins may contribute to stunting, including the induction of environmental enteric dysfunction and systemic immune activation, resulting in the interruption of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) axis. Castelino et al. [152] investigated the relationship between AF and IGF1 in 199 Kenyan schoolchildren, and observed that AF-albumin concentrations were inversely associated with both IGF1 and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3). IGF facilitates most of the growth-promoting effects of growth hormone, and thus plays a major role in the growth of a child [153]. AFs may also induce stunting by exerting an immunosuppressive effect, which often increases the susceptibility of infants to infection, loss of appetite, and reduced nutrient absorption [154]. In addition, AFs may exert infant growth impairment by mediating intestinal damage through the inhibition of protein synthesis [151]. Other mycotoxins like DON have also been postulated to exert growth impairment through this mechanism.

(p14.0) Exposure to mycotoxins has been shown to hamper immune responses in humans and animals, thus leading to a decrease in resistance to infectious diseases [35]. The mechanism through which mycotoxins exert immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory effects on humans and animals may vary depending on toxin type and exposure dose, as well as the investigated parameters highlighted in several reviews [161][162][163]. Bondy and Peska [162] highlighted the ability of mycotoxins to promote the expression of a diverse array of cytokines through inflammatory responses, with a potential to upregulate and downregulate a wide array of immune functions. While mycotoxins impair cell-mediated immunity and phagocytic cell function, exposure to AFs increases the T cell proliferation-inducing capacity of porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells, therefore enhancing the antigen-presenting capacity of the cell [164]. The inhibition of humoral, cellular, and innate immunity by AFs, OTA, and FBs, leading to a reduced response to vaccines, has been reported in animal species [162,165].

(p14.1) Notwithstanding the evidence that IYC, especially in SSA, are most vulnerable to mycotoxin exposure, only a few scientific studies, mostly focusing on AFs, have been conducted to elucidate the effects of these fungus metabolites on the immunity of IYC. Allen et al. [166] investigated the relationship between AF exposure, hepatitis B infection, and the prevalence of malaria in 391 Gambian children between the age of 3 and 8 years, and found that a higher AF-albumin adduct concentration was associated with increased Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia (p = 0.01) and hepatitis B surface antigen (p=0.04) carrier status of the children. However, the authors observed no consistent association between AF-albumin level, malaria infections, malaria-specific antibody, or lymphoproliferative responses. A later cross-sectional study from the same country, using a cohort of 472 children, studied the effect of dietary AF exposure on immune parameters, including secretory IgA in saliva (sIgA) and cell-mediated immunity, as well as antibody response to rabies and pneumococcal vaccines [35]. A remarkably lower sIgA level of children with detectable AF-albumin in their blood was seen compared to no AF-albumin detectable children (p < 0.0001). However, out of the four pneumococcal serotypes, only one response was weakly associated with higher levels of AF-albumin adducts. On the other hand, no association was observed between AF-albumin and cell-mediated immunity or rabies [35].
