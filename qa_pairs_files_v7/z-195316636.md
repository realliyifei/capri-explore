(p7.0) for the evaluation of SODA (Blunschi et al (2012)) and the 10 sample questions of this paper. Therefore, we designed nine questions based on the operators of SQL and SPARQL: Joins, Filters (string, range, date or negation), Aggregations, Ordering, Union and Subqueries.
## (s8) Question Analysis
Number of References: 4

(p8.0) In this section, we perform an analysis comparing our ten sample input questions with the two well-known question-answering corpora Yahoo! QA Corpus L6 2 (more than 4 million questions within a user community) and GeoData250 (Tang and Mooney, 2001) (250 questions against a database). We also summarize the findings of Bonifati et al (2017) and compare them to our input questions. The goal of the analysis is to better understand what types of questions users pose and how representative our sample input questions are (i.e., establish some external validity of their representativeness).
## (s11) Synonymy
Number of References: 8

(p11.0) The difficulty of synonymy is that a simple lookup or matching is not enough. For example, the question 'All movies starring Brad Pitt from 2000 until 2010.' (Q3) could also be phrased as 'All movies playing Brad Pitt from 2000 until 2010.'. The answer should be the same, but because in the sample world no element is named 'playing', a lookup would not find an answer. Therefore, it is necessary that the system takes synonyms into account. A possible solution is the use of a translation dictionary. Usually such a dictionary is based on DBpedia (Lehmann et al, 2012) and/or WordNet (Miller, 1995).

## (s22) Keyword-based systems
Number of References: 4

(p22.0) The core of keyword-based NLIs is their lookup step. In this step, the system tries to match the given keywords against an inverted index of the base and meta data. To identify keywords in the input question, some systems are using stop word removal (e.g., NLP-Reduce (Kaufmann et al, 2007)), others are expecting only keywords from the users as input (e.g., SODA (Blunschi et al, 2012)).
## (s23) SODA (Search Over DAta warehouse)
Number of References: 4

(p23.0) SODA (Blunschi et al, 2012) is a system that provides a keyword-based NLI for relational databases with some extensions in the direction of a pattern-based system. The base data consists of the relational database. The meta data can include multiple ontologies, which are handled like natural language patterns. For example, domain specific ontologies with concepts (like the concept 'great movie' in the sample world) or DBpedia to Fig. 7 Nodes in the meta data graph corresponding to the keywords 'director ' (red) and 'Inglourious Basterds' (green) found during the lookup step of SODA.
## (s25) Précis
Number of References: 2

(p25.0) Précis (Simitsis et al, 2008) is a keyword-based NLI for relational databases, which supports multiple terms combined through the operators AND, OR and NOT. For example, input question 'Show me all drama and comedy movies.' (Q5) would be formulated as '"drama" OR "comedy"'. The answer is an entire multi-relation database, which is a logical subset of the original database.
## (s26) QUICK (QUery Intent Constructor for Keywords)
Number of References: 2

(p26.0) QUICK (Zenz et al, 2009) is an NLI that adds the expressiveness of semantic queries to the convenience of keyword-based search. To achieve this, the users start with a keyword question and then are guided through the process of incremental refinement steps to select the question's intention. The system provides the user with an interface that shows the semantic queries as graphs as well as textual form.
## (s27) QUEST (QUEry generator for STructured sources)
Number of References: 2

(p27.0) QUEST (Bergamaschi et al, 2013) is a keyword-based NLI to translate input questions into SQL. It combines semantic and statistical ML techniques for the translation.
## (s32) QuestIO (QUESTion-based Interface to Ontologies)
Number of References: 2

(p32.0) QuestIO (Damljanovic et al, 2008) is an NLI to query ontologies using unconstrained natural language. It automatically extracts human-understandable lexicalization from the ontology. Therefore, the quality of the semantic information in the ontology has to be very high to contain enough human-understandable labels and/or descriptions. For example, the attribute Movie.Release-Date would be extracted as 'Release Date', which is a human-understandable label. In contrast, the attribute Movie.OriginalLang would result in 'Original Lang', where the token 'Lang' is a shortened version for 'Language' and is not human-understandable.
## (s37) BELA
Number of References: 2

(p37.0) BELA (Walter et al, 2012) is an NLI with a layered approach. This means, that at each layer the best hypothesis is determined. If the confidence for a particular interpretation is 1 and the SPARQL query generated by it produces an answer with at least one result, the translation process is stopped and the answer is returned to the user. Only for ASK-questions (which have yes/no answers), the process continues until the confidence of the interpretations start to differ, then a threshold of 0.9 is applied and an empty result (which equals a no-answer) is also accepted.
## (s48) SPARKLIS
Number of References: 2

(p48.0) SPARKLIS (Ferré, 2017) is a guided query builder for SPARQL using natural language for better understanding. It guides the users during their query phrasing by giving the possibilities to search through concepts, entities and modifiers in natural language. It relies on the rules of SPARQL to ensure syntactically correct SPARQL queries all the time during the process. The interaction with the system makes the question formulation more constrained, slower and less spontaneous, but it provides guidance and safeness with intermediate answers and suggestions at each step. The translation process for SPARKLIS is reversed: it translates possible SPARQL queries into natural language such that the users can understand their choices.
