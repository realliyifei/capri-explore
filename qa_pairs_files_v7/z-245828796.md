(p7.0) Food addiction was found more frequently in patients with obesity, severe depression, higher impulsivity, posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood (8). According to a systematic review (n = 25 studies, N = 196,211 patients, 60% overweight/obese) the prevalence of food addiction was almost 20%, based on the YFAS scores (8). Factors like the age >35, female gender, and higher BMI values were correlated with higher risk for food addiction (8).
