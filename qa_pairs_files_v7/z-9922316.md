(p6.0) Due to its high incidence, reaching 26.69 per 100 000 population per year in a recently published study [13], and frequently involving complications, optimization of treatment of traumatic GHD with a view to preventing recurrence and improving patient performance has received much research interest. Since the idea of immobilization in external rotation first came to light, many studies have been dedicated to confirming its effectiveness and comparing it with the traditional immobilization in adduction and internal rotation [19]. Unfortunately, the conclusions of these works are often contradictory and do not allow to make clear recommendations for practice. This prompted us to conduct a thorough literature review in an attempt to organize the available reports and explain the disparity between favorable results of cadaveric as well as imaging studies and clinical reports, in which ER did not prove significantly more effective than IR.
