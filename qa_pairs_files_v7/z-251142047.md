## (s10) OTHER RADIO-TRACERS

(p10.0) Scarlattei et al [59] have reported incidental findings of 68 Ga-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen ( 68 Ga-PSMA) and 18 F-labelled choline ( 18 F-choline) radiotracer uptake in regions corresponding to subpleural GGOs in two patients who underwent PET/CT for evaluation of prostate cancer [59]. Understanding the exact mechanisms that lead to uptake of these radiotracers in acute infective/inflammatory pulmonary lesions offers an important research prospect.

(p10.1) There is ongoing research directed at identifying targets for molecular imaging of inflammation with several novel radiotracers being described in pre-clinical and early clinical studies, such as 18 F-AzaFol, 89 Zr-labebed Feraheme, and 18 F-GE180 [92][93][94].
