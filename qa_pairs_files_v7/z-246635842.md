(p12.0) Supplementary zinc intakes would significantly level up serum zinc concentration in the general population (41) and decrease the incidence of childhood zinc deficiency by 63% (RR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.62) (16). For adults specifically, the zinc supplemented group though did help improve serum zinc concentration by 0.43 Âµmol/L, the negative value of the lower limit of the effect size manifested that there is a chance that zinc supplementation had no effect (37).
