(p4.0) The role of immune response has been gaining particular interest for cancer therapy. Recently, autophagy has also been described as playing an important role in the regulation of immune recognition and response [42]. It has been demonstrated that autophagy increases tumor cells immunogenicity, being involved in tumor antigen processing and in the subsequent activation of the effector T cells. Thus, strategies aiming at autophagy induction could serve as adjuvant to stimulate the antitumor immune response. For example, the use of tumor autophagosome-derived vaccines have been found to induce cytotoxic immune cells and, consequently, antitumor activity in mice bearing lung carcinoma and melanoma cell lines [43].
