## (s2) Mutant Isocitrate Dehydrogenases Inhibit NAD Production in Cancer
Number of References: 6

(p2.0) Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) converts isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the TCA cycle with NADP + as its cofactor. IDH exists in three isozymes, namely IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3. IDH1, located in the cytosol and peroxisome, is encoded by the IDH1 gene on chromosome 2q34, while IDH2 is localized in the mitochondria and is encoded by the gene located on chromosome 15q26.1 [41]. Both enzymes are NADP-dependent, share high degree of homology and conduct a reversible reaction to maintain the isocitrate pool [12]. Unlike the other two isozymes, IDH3, localized in the mitochondria, exists as a heterocomplex enzyme consisting of α, β, and γ subunits that are encoded by IDH3A (15q25.1), IDH3B (20p13), and IDH3C (Xq28) genes, respectively [41]. IDH3 is activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inhibited by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In order to ensure the continuity of TCA cycle, IDH3 conducts the irreversible conversion of isocitrate to maintain the α-KG pool [12,41,81].
## (s6) Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (MTHFD) Maintains NADP/NADPH Pools in Cancer

(p6.0) MTHFD2 is an enzyme that is required for tumor cell survival [104]. MTHFD2 is highly expressed in the mitochondria and nucleus of multiple types of tumor cells, but not in non-transformed cells [104]. The only non-transformed cell induction of MTHFD2 was observed in lymphocyte activation, indicating the role of MTHFD2 in normal hematopoietic cells as well as in the tumorigenesis process of hematologic malignancies [105].
## (s8) Targeting Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) Sensitizes Cancer
Number of References: 2

(p8.0) Aldehyde dehydrogenases are groups of NAD-dependent enzymes in the ALDH superfamily that consists of 19 different NADP-dependent ALDH enzymes. ALDHs are localized in both cytosol and mitochondria [117]. Crystallographic analysis has shown that ALDH has a specific coenzyme NAD binding domain. This implies that NAD is a significant component required by ALDH to execute its functions in retinoic acid biosynthesis, GABA neurotransmitter metabolism and alcohol metabolism [117].
