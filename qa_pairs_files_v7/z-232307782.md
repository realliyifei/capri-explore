## (s22) Strong arc decomposition
Number of References: 7

(p22.0) Recall that it is NP-complete to decide whether a digraph D has a pair of arc-disjoint out-branching and in-branching rooted at r, which was proved by Thomassen (see [4]). In connection with this problem, Thomassen [59] posed the following conjecture: There exists an integer N so that every N -arcstrong digraph D contains a pair of arc-disjoint in-and out-branchings. A digraph D = (V, A) has a strong arc decomposition if A has two disjoint sets A 1 and A 2 such that both (V, A 1 ) and (V, A 2 ) are strong [11]. Bang-Jensen and Yeo [21] generalized 1 the above conjecture as follows: There exists an integer N so that every N -arc-strong digraph D has a good decomposition. For a general digraph D, it is NP-complete to decide whether a digraph has a strong arc decomposition [11]. In the same paper, Bang-Jensen and Yeo characterized semicomplete digraphs with a strong arc decomposition. Bang-Jensen and Huang [15] extended this result by characterizing locally semicomplete digraphs with such a decomposition. After that, Sun, Gutin and Ai [54] continued research on strong arc decompositions in classes of digraphs and consider digraph compositions and products.
