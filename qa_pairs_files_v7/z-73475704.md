## (s8) New names for the identification of depolarization abnormalities?
Number of References: 2

(p8.0) Initially, depolarization abnormalities occurring at the beginning, inside or at the end of the QRS complex were classified as ε waves [26]. These changes could also be defined as QRS fragmentation. Later on, it was considered preferable to use the term ε wave only for LPs occurring after the QRS for clinical use. Li et al. proposed to use the terms Presilon, Topsilon and Postsilon for depolarization abnormalities occurring at the beginning, in the top of and at the end of the QRS complex, respectively [26] (Fig. 3).
