Number of References: 3

(p26.0) Studies have been conducted over last 100 years in attempt to valorize fish waste through conversion of waste into products such as fish protein concentrates, fish oil, and fish meal.Techno-econo-environmental issues should be considered in utilization of fish waste as raw material.These considerations are also important to evaluate feasibility of products development in industrial-scale from lowvalue or from fish species which are less preferred for human consumption.Although in the Scotland due to cheap disposal cost, fish wastes are not generally considered for other applications, but on the other hand, Norway is an exemplary country that has been utilizing seafood waste efficiently [153].Crist√≥bal et al. (2018) investigated potato, tomato, citrus fruits and olive waste valorization pathways in European level and found that only some particular pathways are economically profitable where market price of the produced products and economies of scale greatly function as a determinant of profitability [154].From fish waste, various products describes in the previous section of this article can be produced and as these products has important applications in medical, pharmaceutical, cosmeceuticals, food, packaging, animal feed industries, so, some fish waste valorization pathways has potential to be economically profitable.
