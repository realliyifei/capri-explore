(p7.0) Note that this paper concentrates on well-balancing techniques and asymptotic preserving schemes for hyperbolic systems for chemotaxis. Recently, various articles have studied numerical techniques for kinetic systems for chemotaxis. After some first articles [48,100], using for example semilagrangian methods, well-balanced and asymptotic preserving schemes have been derived. For example, an even and odd formalism may be used to construct an asymptotic preserving scheme towards the parabolic modified Keller-Segel system [29] or Volpert calculus enables to derive an asymptotic preserving scheme in the hydrodynamic limit [73]. Some well-balanced schemes may be found in [53] or, more recently in [56], where the authors introduce a scheme, which is at the same time well-balanced, following the approach of [53], and asymptotic-preserving using Volpert calculus, as in [73]. Another technique consists in constructing a two-steps scheme , combining a well-balanced step and an asymptotic-preserving scheme [42].
