## (s5) Mechanisms of viral inactivation by ozone
Number of References: 10

(p5.0) Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent with many industrial applications for water and air treatment among others (Martinelli et al., 2017;Wei et al., 2017). Even though the lethality of O 3 against viruses is widely known, the understanding of the inactivation mechanisms still remains limited. Most of this knowledge comes from studies dealing with virus disinfection by ozone in water, although it might be expected that it can be extrapolated to the disinfection in other media such as aerosols or solid surfaces, as similar principles may apply .
