## (s3) Mechanism of Thermoregulation in Poultry
Number of References: 4

(p3.0) Poultry is warm-blooded, meaning it can maintain a constant body temperature despite changes in ambient temperature [52].Poultry begins to exhibit behavioral responses to expel excess heat, as shown in Figure 2. The cooling mechanism in poultry can be divided into four processes: (1) Conduction processes, for example, being in contact with the floor, planks, sidewalls, and cage floors inside the house [53][54][55] with a temperature lower than the animal's body temperature, which causes internal body heat to flow along the surface.
