## (s0) Introduction
Number of References: 3

(p0.0) Karl Meyer and John Palmer were the first to extract hyaluronic acid (conjugate base hyaluronate) from bovine vitreous humor in 1934. They named it based on its appearance (hyalos: glass in Greek) and structure (uronic acid: one of sugar molecules) [1]. Endre Balazs later defined various forms of the molecule in 1986. The suggestion of "hyaluronan" (HA) by Balazs (1986) was found to fit well with the international nomenclature of polysaccharides and was subsequently adopted [2].
## (s1) Interactions of HA with ECM Components and Cell Receptor Proteins

(p1.0) The ECM is the non-cellular portion of all mammalian tissues. It is responsible for physical scaffolding of cells and initiates biochemical and biomechanical processes that mediate morphogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis of tissues. These structural and functional roles are made possible by the inherent properties of ECM, concomitant with its direct interaction with cell surface receptors, as well as local binding and release of growth factors. The structure of the ECM is highly dynamic, and its normal function is dependent on enzymatic and non-enzymatic remodeling [44][45][46][47].
