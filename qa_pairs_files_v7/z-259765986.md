(p6.0) Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that involves defining classes from data without knowing the labels of classes. In clustering, data is categorized into collections (or clusters) based on their similarities (52). Clustering algorithms apply when there is no class for prediction, so the instances divide into natural groups. Clustering distributed classifiers relies on the following: (i) A measure of classifier distance, (ii) An efficient algorithm for computing this distance measure for classifiers induced in physically distributed databases, and (iii) A clustering algorithm (23). The distributed clustering algorithms of consensus-based algorithm and distributed k-means algorithm are discussed in the following. A summary of these algorithms can be found in Table 2.
