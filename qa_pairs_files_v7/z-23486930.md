(p0.0) Surgical resection or transplantation have in the past been considered the gold standard for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The overall resectability rate for such lesions is very low due to a combination of underlying chronic liver disease, lesion location and multifocal nature of HCC. Similarly, surgical resection carries a significant associated morbidity and mortality, as well as a disease recurrence rate of up to 75% [1,2] . Local thermal ablative techniques have gained popularity over the last decade proving to be an effective and safe alternative in many patients. These techniques are also cost effective in comparison to other treatments and are able to maximise the preservation of surrounding liver parenchyma whilst minimizing in-patient hospitalization [3] . Laser ablation (LA) represents one of a range of currently available loco-ablative techniques with the majority of reported data coming from Italy, Germany and the UK.
