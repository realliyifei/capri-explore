(p16.0) This scoping review provides a preliminary insight into the role of analytics in evaluating mHealth apps for transition-aged youth and identifies both progress that has been made and future areas of exploration. Most importantly, this review adds to the sparse literature on analytics and highlights the need for researchers to assess and standardize how to integrate analytics into their evaluation plans [25]. The addition of more case studies on analytics may help to identify emergent patterns that help us understand how transition-aged youth decide to adopt a solution to address their needs [14].
