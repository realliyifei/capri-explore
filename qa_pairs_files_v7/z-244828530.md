(p2.0) Bacteria are able to form a biofilm on the surface of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [10]-the main material used in the production of removable dentures. The ability to colonize and create biofilm on the surfaces of prostheses allows bacteria to use this additional niche for growth in the presence of a specific protective environment, which makes it difficult to remove them; hence, in cases of poor oral hygiene, prostheses can serve as a reservoir and cause persistent halitosis [10].
