(p1.0) The integration of DC systems in AC-based infrastructures provides a new framework of grid capabilities [9]. As it is foreseen, DC solutions need to "harmoniously co-exist" with the already available AC infrastructures, developing hybrid architectures in which the best result of both approaches can be achieved [10].
