(p5.0) The gold standard for genotyping of S. epidermidis is pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (76), which could also be utilized to characterize other species of Staphilococcus. Genotyping methods used in studies on the molecular epidemiology of CoNS are mainly based on two different techniques: DNA banding pattern analysis and DNA sequencing and recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy (77).
