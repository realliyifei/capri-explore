## (s0) Introduction
Number of References: 6

(p0.0) The main function of the kidney is to eliminate toxins generated by the metabolic processes of the body (Clark et al., 2019). Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or who are in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have this function affected, which leads to accumulation of the aforementioned toxins in the circulatory system, a condition called "uremia" (Clark & Gao, 2002;Franco et al., 2019). An accumulation of these so-called uremic toxins (UTs) in the body generates several deleterious effects in the organism, including malnutrition, anemia, dermal atrophies, dyslipidemia, metabolic acidosis, inflammation, pericarditis, hypertension, heart failure, coagulation disorders, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVDs are the leading cause of death in these patients (Go et al., 2004;Vanholder et al., 2005, Vanholder et al., 2008.
## (s8) Middle molecules

(p8.0) Middle molecules are mainly composed of peptides larger than 500 Da (Vanholder & Glorieux, 2003). Examples of this group are Î²2-microglobulin (11,818 Da), interleukin-6 (IL-6; 24,500 Da), complement factor D (26,750 Da), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23; 32,000 Da), parathyroid hormone (PTH; 9,225 Da), and others. Studies have shown that the type of dialyzer could influence the removal of middle molecular weight uremic toxins (Maduell et al., 2014;Wolley et al., 2018).
