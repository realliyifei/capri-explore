(p10.0) Cycling is a well-known physical activity that has many health benefits for cyclists. Among them, cardio-respiratory fitness and reduced risk of developing diseases such as morbid obesity are some few examples [83]. Even in the cases when cyclists are exposed to harmful air pollution conditions-as discussed in the last section-the benefits of cycling may overlap the problems that inhaling polluted air can cause, excepting on extreme conditions of pollutants concentrations [84]. Promoting health habits by the use of bikes is a trending topic.
