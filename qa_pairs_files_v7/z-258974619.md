(p0.0) There were an estimated 18.1 (9.3 in men and 8.8 in women) million new cancer cases and 9.9 (5.5 in men and 4.4 in women) million cancer deaths worldwide in 2020.Breast and lung cancers were the most common cancers worldwide (12.5% and 12.2% of the total number of new cases diagnosed in 2020, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), followed by colorectal cancer (10.7% of new cases).With the burden growing in almost every country, preventing cancer is one of the most significant public health challenges of the 21st century.It has been estimated that 30-50% of cancer cases could be prevented by tackling risk factors relating to diet, nutrition, and physical activity [117].According to the World Cancer Research Fund Prevention Recommendations, changing dietary patterns (i.e., eating whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and limiting consumption of red and processed meat, fast-food products, and sugary drinks), reducing alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight can impact people's likelihood of developing cancer and other noncommunicable diseases over their lifetimes [19].Tailored statistical methods are essential to support the collection of a sound evidence base for cancer prevention.
## (s15) Treelet Transform

(p15.0) A composite of hierarchical CA and traditional PCA, treelet transform [72] provides an improvement over traditional PCA and an important contribution to clustering methodology.For clustering methodology, it provides a framework which actively searches for the correct underlying correlation structure of the data.Its improvement over PCA happens especially when the correlation matrix is believed to be sparse, as in the analysis of dietary patterns, and is generally worth note [123].
## (s22) CROSS-STUDY REPRODUCIBILITY OF DIETARY PATTERNS: NOVEL STATISTICAL APPROACHES

(p22.0) Compared to most a priori dietary patterns -especially indexes of overall diet quality -which can be more easily used across different study populations, the a posteriori approach estimates population-specific dietary patterns.Indeed, if the patterns are derived by explaining the variability among diets of one population, it is unlikely the same patterns would be found in another population.While their reproducibility is necessarily more limited, a posteriori dietary patterns reflect the actual dietary practices in the population under study and provide crucial information [37].Dietary patterns should reveal those latent characteristics of interest, including socio-demographic and socio-economic factors, ethnic background, religion, and several other environmental factors, like food supply, ability to purchase/prepare foods, advertisements for foods, and the efforts of the government and the nutrition community to foster healthy diets [63], which are at the origin of actual dietary practices.Common latent characteristics may end up in common dietary patterns across studies.
