(p8.0) Detailed information about the level of resistance of COVID-19 in the environment is not available, but it seems to behave like other CoVs [72]. Recent studies have shown that the resistance of human CoVs such as SARS-CoV, MERS, and other endemic human CoV, is varied in different surfaces (from 2 h to 9 days) [72], [73]. The survival time of these viruses is affected by many factors such as surface structure, temperature, relative humidity, and type of virus species so that on inanimate surfaces such as metals, glass, and plastics can survive up to 9 days [72], [73].
