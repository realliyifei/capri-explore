(p10.0) Due to GAN's particularity, there is not an unique metric to measure the quality of the synthesized data [190]. One of the reasons of why there is no consensus among researches is the particularity of each GAN application. As mentioned in previous sections, GANs can be used to replicate any data distribution, but it depends on the particular problem how to measure the differences between the origin and synthesized distributions [17].
## (s24) Cycle-Consistent GAN (CycleGAN)

(p24.0) Cyclic consistency is the idea that, given a data x from a domain A, if the data is translated to a domain B and translated again to the A domain it should be recovered the data x. In other words, if a sample is translated to a domain and recovered from that domain, it should not change. This process, where a data sample is transformed and recovered, is known as cycle consistency, and it has been widely used during the last decades [162,75].
## (s61) Drug discovery using GANs
Number of References: 2

(p61.0) The process of discovering and designing new drugs has recently been impulsed by the field of Deep Learning [70,32]. In particular, GANs are an useful technique to synthesize new useful samples of data. In the drug environment, the GAN architecture can process the drug compound using graphs or Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification (SMILES), to then generate synthetic samples of drugs.
