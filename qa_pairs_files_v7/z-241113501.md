(p2.0) Bell's palsy is named after Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842). Although he was the first to present the anatomical basis of Bell's palsy, recent research has revealed that other European practitioners contributed earlier clinical descriptions and accounts of the seventh peripheral cranial nerve palsy [7]. The first case report of idiopathic facial paralysis is believed to have been published by an 18th-century medicine professor, Nicolaus Friedrich, in Wurzburg. The case report described three middle-aged men with similar episodes of unilateral facial paralysis, which was subacute or acute in origin and gradually bettered in a few weeks to months. Later, Charles Bell studied facial nerve function in animals. He encountered several unilateral facial nerve paralysis cases during his surgical practice in London. His most well-known and widely cited case of facial palsy was posted in 1828, in which he presented a matter of a man hit by a bull and the resulting injury caused perpetual facial nerve paralysis [8].
## (s7) Clinical examination and diagnosis
Number of References: 2

(p7.0) A thorough neurologic and general examination, including ear examination, ophthalmological examination, and consideration of the skin and parotid gland, should be included in the clinical study [21]. Herpes zoster may be suspected if there are blisters or scabbing around the ear known as Ramsay-Hunt syndrome which can result in hearing loss and also facial nerve palsy. Observing the patient during the interview may reveal subtle symptoms of weakness and provide ancillary information [7].
