(p5.0) Terpenoids are a large class of diverse organic compounds, occurring naturally in plants to protect against biotic and abiotic stresses. Based on the number of isoprene units, terpenoids can be classified into monoterpenes (10 carbons), sesquiterpenes (15 carbons), diterpenes (20 carbons), sesterpenes (25 carbons), and triterpenes (30-40 carbons) [45]. They are the major constituents of essential oils (EOs) and exhibit several pharmacological and biological activities [45]. The major terpenoids found in PL are mainly pentacyclic triterpenoids such as ursolic acid, 19,24-dihydroxyursolic acid, 19-hydroxyursolic acid, 24-hydroxyursolic acid, siaresinolic acid, oleanolic acid, barbinervic acid, rotungenic acid, amyrin, and uvaol, among others ( Figure 3).
