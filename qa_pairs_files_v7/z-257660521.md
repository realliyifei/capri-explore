(p16.0) Due to the extensively high energy demands coupled with the paradoxically low energy storage, the brain requires continuous and dynamically regulated blood supply in order to maintain proper function [109]. A precise and prompt blood flow control that can dynamically increase the supply to areas of intense neuronal activity is thus required. This process, named neurovascular coupling (NVC), is accomplished by the communication between active neurons and the cells that form the neurovascular compartment [110] through a multitude of molecular pathways. Among those pathways, NO plays a ubiquitous key role in the process and is essential for the development of the neurovascular response.

(p16.1) Through the formation of a supramolecular complex with NMDAR, nNOS activity becomes regulated by glutamate, through Ca 2+ intracellular influx [25]. As a result of NMDAR activation. Properly dimerized nNOS will proceed to produce NO, however, under the condition of disrupted dimerization, the enzyme catalyzes the uncoupled oxida-tion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), with the production of superoxide instead [111]. One of the noteworthy factors that can lead to reduced nNOS dimerization is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) availability, which has been noted to be reduced in AD patients [112].
