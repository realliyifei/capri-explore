## (s4) Supplementation with Leucine and Essential Amino Acids May Benefit Older Adults with Low Protein Intake
Number of References: 6

(p4.0) Various amino acids, such as β-alanine, L-glutamine, L-arginine, L-leucine and its bioactive form (hydroxymethyl butyrate) have been studied for nutritional management of sarcopenia because they are anti-catabolic and anabolic in nature [80]. For example, studies have shown that supplementation of β-alanine [81][82][83][84] may prevent and delay the progression of sarcopenia by addressing the systemic depletion of carnosine (β-alanyll-histidine), a dipeptide that acts as a pH buffer and is predominantly found in skeletal muscle. However, of these substrates, leucine is the most well studied, and requires greater understanding regarding adequate dosing and short-term versus long-term effects on muscle health [80]. Therefore, this review will discuss research surrounding the effects of leucine supplementation in older adults with low protein intake.
