(p0.0) Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in female cancer sufferers in both developed and developing countries [1]. The exact cause(s) of the majority of breast cancers still remains unknown [2]. By far the most effective way to tackle the disease is through early detection, precise identification of women at risk, and applying preventative measures. Within screening mammography, both mammographic density and parenchymal pattern have been established as image-based risk factors [2]. Current studies suggest that mammographic density is a major risk factor, even though it adds only little to the Gail model [3], and it is still not clear how to incorporate the factors as biomarkers into the risk prediction models [4].
