## (s5) Non-smooth loss based models

(p5.0) The methods we described above typically require the loss function L to be sufficiently smooth, although a non-smooth regularization term is permitted (see e.g., Zhang et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2017;Jordan et al., 2019;Zhu et al., 2019). However, there are also some useful methods involving non-smooth loss functions, such as quantile regression and support vector machine. It is then of great interest to develop distributed methods for these methods.
