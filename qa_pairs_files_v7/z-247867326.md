(p7.0) We have isolated this topic from the previous sections due to the rapidly increasing global prevalence of myopia and the large impact, now and in the future, that myopia is likely to exert on the global public health system and individual quality of life also. 131 Moderate to severe myopia are important for effects in relation to foveal integrity and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness as well as factors such as retinal detachment. 131 Treatments for myopia (such as refractive surgery, low-dose atropine, gene therapy, lenses and others) 132-136 need further study with power vectors and matrices but studies are available and more emerge each year.
