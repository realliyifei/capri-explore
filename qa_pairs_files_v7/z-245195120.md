(p3.0) Eye and Brain 2021:13 256 form of cupping, and occurs in optic neuropathies in which the connective tissues of the optic nerve head have been damaged, becoming more susceptible to intraocular pressure (IOP) induced deformation. Whether the optic nerve head is initially damaged due to inflammatory, ischemic, or genetic causes, the process that leads to deformation of the damaged tissue is IOP related. 12 This explains how optic nerve head damage can occur due to a non-IOP related process yet appear "glaucomatous". Recent modelling studies investigating optic nerve head biomechanics have found that laminar cupping may be a biomechanical feedback mechanism to restore mechanical homeostasis. 13 This theory is also supported by studies showing that laminar cupping and thickening can have stress-lowering effects. 14,15
