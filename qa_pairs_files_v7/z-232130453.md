(p3.0) Extensive existing urban landcover, and the inevitability of increased urbanization in the future, calls for adaptive responses instead of mitigation measures, per se [79]. Ecosystem-based adaptation is a sustainable and cost-effective approach for improving adaptive capacity, building on the premise that the natural environment is the most important input into local economies and human well-being ( Figure 3). Ecosystem-based adaptation is especially important for cities in the southern hemisphere, owing to their risk-prone states and limited resources to deal with natural disasters [80].
