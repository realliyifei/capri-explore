## Introduction

In industrial companies lifting equipment, such as overhead cranes, winches, conveyors, is often used to transport heavy loads. It is usually characterized by large sizes, limited reach and high purchase costs. Today's industrial halls built with the use of modern technologies allow for obtaining horizontal and smooth work surfaces, including tilt α ≤ 0.1o and a roughness of Ra ≤ 12.5 μm.

This condition allows for applying transport systems with a pneumatic cushion. Pneumatic cushions are devices of small size, characterized by low height, which ranges from 30 to 40. This simple design allows for sliding cushions under large loads and devices easily. In the laboratory of the Institute of Applied Informatics in the University of Technology, research is conducted on improving the parameters of pneumatic cushions through structural changes and the use of new control systems [2,3]. A research stand in the form of a transport platform ( Fig. 1) allows for testing new solutions at different load values.

During operation, a pneumatic cushion creates a film of air which reduces friction with the ground. This film is produced by air that flows radially from the chambers in the lower part of the cushion. In the standard design of the air cushion [6], the air flows through one nozzle, placed in the central axis. Such a solution has some disadvantages, which include difficulties in achieving position stability and high sensitivity to surface irregularities. As part of this work, a solution consisting in increasing the number of outflow nozzles was proposed. Prototypes of a cushion with additional three and eight symmetrically placed nozzles were made. Then, a research was carried out on the impact of the number and deployment of nozzles on air demand through a pneumatic cushion depending on the load. 


## Mathematical model

Before the start of the research, a mathematical model of a pneumatic cushion with one outlet nozzle, a model with four outlet nozzles and a model with nine nozzles were built. The models were used to determine the theoretical value of the required volume air flow at set values of other parameters such as pressure and temperature.


### Model of the pneumatic cushion with a single outlet

The simplified cross section of the pneumatic cushion is shown in Figure 2. The mathematical model of the pneumatic cushion with one outlet nozzle included the following geometric parameters: d 1 -diameter of the supply collector, p 1 -inlet pressure, d 2 -diameter of the outlet nozzle, F o -force from the load, p 2 , p 3 -pressure in the air chambers, V 2 , V 3 -volume of the air chambers, h f -height of the air gap, p o -pressure ambient, R 1 , R 2external and internal radius of the surface cooperating with the floor.

The calculation of the volume flow through the outlet nozzle was performed for the constant state, when the pressure in the side air chamber equalized (p 1 = p 2 ). With this assumption, the volumetric flow rate was calculated for the slit outlet nozzle [4,6]:
Q A d p p p 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 4 2 P Q P S U (1) where A 1 -cross-sectional area of the nozzle, v 1 -flow velocity, m 1 -discharge coefficient, d 2 -diameter
of the nozzle, p 1 , p 3 -pressure at the nozzle inlet and in the outlet chamber, ρ p -air density.

The flow of air Q 3 through the annular slit formed between the lower surface of the pneumatic cushion and the rigid surface was calculated by integrating the elementary flow q r through a segment of the ring-shaped surface of the thickness of dr within limits from R 2 to [5,6]. After performing simple transformations, a formula was obtained describing the air flow rate at the pneumatic cushion outlet for a constant state:
Q p R R h f 3 3 1 2 3 6 § © · 1 S K ln (2)
where h f -height of the air gap, p 3 -pressure at the outlet chamber, η -coefficient of dynamic, R 1 , R 2 -external and internal radius of the surface cooperating with the floor.


### Model of the pneumatic cushion with the quad outlets

In this case, in the pneumatic cushion, apart from the main outlet nozzle to the lower chamber, three additional outlet nozzles were made, which were arranged on the lower surface of the cushion evenly at 120 degrees on the circle of radius R d = 150 mm. The mathematical model of a pneumatic cushion with four nozzles is defined according to the indications shown in Fig. 3. Assuming flow continuity in constant, volumetric flow rates at individual points of the pneumatic cushion can be noted using formulas (3)-(7). The flow rate through the supply channel nozzle can be noted in the following equation: 

The flow rate through each of the three nozzles placed in the lower part of the side chamber assuming uniformity of load and symmetry of the system: 

The total flow of air through the gap between the pneumatic cushion and the ground:
Q Q Q p R R h f 6 5 4 3 1 2 3 3 6 S K ln / (7) where A i , v i -area and flow velocity, φ -velocity coefficient, m i -discharge coefficient, d i
-diameter of the nozzle, p 1 , p 2 , p 3 -pressure at the inlet, in the side chamber and in the bottom chamber, ρ i -air density, κ -adiabatic coefficient. The model with nine nozzles was made analogously to the model with four nozzles, with eight nozzles evenly distributed on the circle every 45 degrees. The mathematical model of a pneumatic cushion with four nozzles is defined according to the indications shown in Fig. 4.

The flow rate in this case is described by equations (4)-(6), supplemented by the equation of the total air flow intensity, which in this case has the following form: The constructed mathematical models were used to determine the volume value of the flow rate as a function of supply pressure using the Maple [1] program.

## Experimental research

In order to conduct experimental research, three prototypes of cushions with an external radius of R 1 = 250 mm were built with one, four and nine outlet nozzles respectively. The appearance of the cushion with four nozzles is shown in Figure 5. During the research, volumetric flow rates were determined depending on the supply pressure. Each graph contains the following curves: 1 -experimental testing at a standstill (without moving the system), 2 -experimental test during the movement of the pneumatic cushion, 3 -theoretical calculation at a standstill (without moving the system), 4 -theoretical calculation during the movement of the air cushion. Sample results of pneumatic cushion tests for the load of m 3 = 324.0 kg, are shown in Fig. 6-8. The presented research results show a good correlation between theoretical calculationsand experimental tests. The maximum difference is up to 10% for the single-nozzle pneumatic cushion nd up to 20% for cushions with four and nine nozzles. Slightly larger differences can be observed during the movement of the cushions. This may be caused by surface irregularities which were not included in the mathematical model.


## Conclusions

The paper studied air cushions with different numbers of nozzles. The dependence of the flow rate as a function of supply pressure for different loads was obtained. The comparison of test results showed that increasing the number of nozzles to four means about twice the increase in air flow required to create the air gap. In the case of a cushion with nine holes, this is an increase of about six fold. At the same time, increasing the number of nozzles leads to a significant improvement in the stabilization of the position of a pneumatic cushion. When lifting the load with the single-nozzle cushion, there was a visible waving effect. This effect was significantly reduced after using the cushion with four nozzles and practically disappeared after using the cushion with nine nozzles. Increasing the number of nozzles also led to a reduction in the force necessary to move the cushion with the load. The use of the cushion with four nozzles allowed for the reduction of force by about 20%, while the cushion with nine nozzles enabledthe reduction of this force by about 50%.
