Title: Catatonia Secondary to Sudden Clozapine Withdrawal: A Case with Three Repeated Episodes and a Literature Review
Supplementary Material including The Modified Liverpool Adverse Drug Reaction Causality Scale Represented as Figures from 9 Previously Published Cases (Figures S1-S9) and 3 Catatonic Episodes from Our Patient (Figures S10-S12) Case Reports in Psychiatry 2017


Do you suspect a drug reaction from sudden withdrawal of clozapine?

What is the probability the catatonia is caused by an underlying illness? Did catatonia recur when clozapine was withdrawn at a subsequent time?

Is there a past history of catatonia being induced after clozapine withdrawal?

Has clozapine withdrawal been reported to cause catatonia? Probable Yes Yes Did catatonia symptoms improve with readministration of clozapine or with catatonia treatment?
