The paper focused on nutrition research and the common facing problem of health as malnutrition to the community from a human health perspective and to the immune system.This focus has served to unite 'food-facing' and 'health-facing' aspects which have been treated as a continuum.The aim was to ensure that all relevant sectors were adequately supported to carry out relevant to malnutrition health issue to cause effects with immune system.Malnutrition may be a consequence of energy deficit or micronutrient deficiency.It is considered the most relevant risk factor for illness and death, particularly in developing countries.We described the magnitude of this problem, as well as its direct effect on the immune system and how it results in higher susceptibility to infections.A special emphasis was given to experimental models used to investigate the relationship between undernutrition and immunity.Malnutrition is obviously a challenge that must be addressed to health authorities and the scientific community.

## Scope of Future Research:

The future vision is by nature broad and ambitious and focuses on scientific opportunity.It envisages a revitalised field which fully capitalises on the immense potential of the expertise and resources (both public and private) in the local areas, thereby maximising the translation of research to improve human health and well-being, both nationally and globally.


## Research Outcomes for Community

• Nutrition research with malnutrition fulfil within studies of health and disease to optimise health outcomes and improve the reproducibility and robustness along with a resources in the public and private sectors to maximise value from existing public and industrial/commercial investments.Increased leadership and a more explicit role for nutrition and improve malnutrition condition by education across health research (basic and clinical) within include the establishment of a single professional medical body concerned with nutrition to foster the coherent development of systematic training and education, research and practice.• Besides working towards strengthening our healthcare system in these times, another thing we'd like to spice up is our own immunity because we all know that prevention is best than cure.Important for us find ways to strengthen our health.Here's a glance at Indian foods that boost


## INTRODUCTION

Nutrition and mal absorption research will be defined to the study of interaction between diet (as whole diets, dietary components, dietary patterns) and the physical body at the individual (molecular through to whole-body) or population level related to significant local activities and local partnering associated with issues too as like-primary food production, food security, sustainability and waste, food packaging, preservation and safety ( Van den Broeck, J.1993, Radhakrishna, R.2004, Van den Broeck, J.1993 and Alam, N.H.2003).

The nature of nutrition is that the set of integrated processes by which cells, tissues, organs and therefore the whole body acquire the energy and nutrients for normal structure and performance, which is achieved at body level through dietary supply, and therefore the capacity of the body to rework the substrates and cofactors necessary for metabolism (Beisel, W.R., 1996 The causal relationship of malnutrition with immune suppression which is named a primary immunodeficiency and infection is additionally aggravated as in gastrointestinal parasites that cause diarrhea, anemia, nutrient deprivation, underweight, stunting, wasting, marasmus, marasmic kwashiorkor, malnutrition ,edema, triangular face, primary or amenorrhea , extended abdomen and anal or rectal prolapse, changes in hair and complexion , anemia, hepatomegaly, lethargy, severe immunodeficiency and early death (Phillips, R.J.,1993, Stephen CA,.2001).

Secondary or acquired immunodeficiency is that the loss of immune function that results from a spread of extrinsic factors.the foremost documented secondary immunodeficiency is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that results to cause loss of subcutaneous fat, which markedly reduces bodily capacity to manage temperature, provoking dehydration, hypothermia and hypoglycaemia, loss of both absorption and digestion capacity, fat degeneration in diverse organs including the liver and, the heart, coronary insufficiency that demands urgent correction


## Review of Literature

This review has profound clinical and public health implication.This may boost the thought of nutritional manipulation of system as an innovative powerful tool to scale back illness and death caused by different communicable and non disease (Mamta Tiwari, Anurag Pandey, Anurag Agrawal 2014)


## Spices Haldi (TURMERIC)

Taking turmeric in one form or the opposite is extremely good for health.It contains a compound called curcumin that has strong anti-inflammatory effects and helps in preventing flu and even heart condition.Moreover, it also improves digestion and soothes a pharyngitis.


## Kali Mirchi (BLACK PEPPER)

A lot of Indians use it to garnish food but did you recognize that it's an excellent health booster also?Piperine may be a compound within the spice which is high in antioxidants and has antiinflammatory and antibacterial properties.It eliminates harmful toxins from the body.


## Dalchini (CINNAMON)

Cinnamon is laden with antioxidants.it's anti-inflammatory properties and is claimed to assist reduce the danger of infections and diseases.People affected by diabetes should consume it because it helps lower blood glucose levels.


## Medicinal Plants Tulsi

According to Ayurveda, tulsi is nature's best antibiotic.it's got some really effective antiviral and antibacterial properties which work as a panacea when it involves fevers, headaches, sore throats and coughs.This is often why many homes in India have a plant reception .It's not only workshipped, but people believe eating a tulsi leaf directly or by adding in tea or water, it can help allay aches and pharyngitis.


## Neem

Neem cools our body and provides it the specified boost.It also has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties that keep infections cornered.Aside from this, they purify and cleanse the blood of harmful toxins.


## Fruits Amla

Amla may be a fantastic source of vitamin C. It increases the body's white blood corpuscle count and also helps in preventing viral infections like flu.Besides that, it also improves digestive health and balances stomach's acid levels.


## Citrus Fruits

Most people are advised to require vitamin C after they catch because they build our system because it increases production of white blood cells which play an instrument in fighting infections.


## Papaya

Papaya may be a fruit filled with vitamin C.This isn't that documented.Papayas even have a digestive enzyme called papain which contains elements that ensure anti-inflammatory effects.

Papayas even have good amounts of potassium, B vitamins, and folate, all of which are beneficial to your overall healthall are important to spice up your health.


## Kiwi

Kiwis also are a storehouse of essential nutrients, including folate, potassium, vitamin K, and vitamin C. of these are required to stay the body functioning properly.


## Jamun

It also features a myriad of advantages .It purifies the blood, controls vital sign and regulates blood glucose levels and reduces incidences of fever, cold and cough.


## Dry fruits Almonds

Almonds are full of vitamin E and also contain healthy fats.It fights and prevents cold and is understood to spice up overall immunity.


## Other important programmes to combat malnutrition in India

Two major programmes designed to enhance food security viz. the PDS (making available foodgrains at affordable prices) and employment generation schemes (improving purchasing power through self and wage employment) have already been discussed intimately .However, it'll be within the fitness of things to briefly mention other programme which attack malnutrition directly or indirectly, since ultimate test of food security lies in nutritional well being of all.Direct attack on malnutrition has become necessary because it had been felt that hopes of aggregate growth percolating right down to most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups didn't come true."In the face of continuous poverty and malnutrition, an alternate strategy of development, comprising a frontal attack on poverty, unemployment and malnutrition became a national priority from the start of the Fifth Five Year Plan.This shift in strategy has given rise to number of interventions to extend the purchasing power of the poor, to enhance the provisions of basic services to the poor and to plan a security system through which the foremost vulnerable sections of the poor (viz.women and children) are often protected" (NNP, 1993).


## A. WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT SECTOR 1. Integrated Child Development Service Programme (ICDS)

This is a singular programme under which a package of integrated services consisting of supplementary nutrition, immunization, checkup up, referal and education service are provided to the foremost vulnerable groups even within children and ladies , i.e. children up 6 years aged and expectant/nursing mother, through a standard focus called Anganwadi (the courtyard centres) in each of the village/urban slums.The objectives of ICDS (Annual Report, Department of girls and Child Development, 199394) are:

• to enhance the nutritional and health status of youngsters within the age bracket 0-6 years;

• to get the inspiration for correct psychological, physical and social development of the child; • to scale back the incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition and faculty drop out;

• to manage effective coordination of policy and programme implementation amongst various departments to market child development; • to reinforce the potential of the mother through proper nutrition education for taking care of the traditional health and nutritional needs and health of the kid


## Special Nutrition Programme (SNP)

This programme was launched way back in 1970-71 for an equivalent target group as in ICDS i.e. children below 6 years age and expectant and nursing mothers.The programme is confined to tribal areas and slums.Main activity under this programme is to supply supplementary feeding to the beneficiaries for 300 days during a year, although some individual initiatives were made in some States to link another services with supplementary feeding.for instance , in early seventies within the small State of Tripura in North Eastern India, a faculty drop out tribal girl was selected for running the feeding centre, given some motivational training then encouraged to impart pre-school education to the youngsters , teach them simple personal hygiene etc. Tribal communities were exhorted, and that they invariably did so, to construct alittle hall where the pre-school activities could happen.Under this programme, every child is to receive 300 calories and eight to fifteen gms of protein and each expectant and nursing mother 500 calories and 20 to 25 gms of protein per day.

As and when ICDS projects coyer 'tine areas having the SNP, the programme is merged with ICDS.


## Balwadi Nutrition Programme

Bal (children) wadi (home or centre) Nutrition Programme may be a contemporary of SNP and is being implemented since 1970-71 by the Central welfare Board and national level nongovernmental voluntary organisations, namely, Indian Council for Child Welfare, Harijan (Scheduled Castes) Sevak (Service) Sangh (Board), Bhartiya (Indian) Adimjati (Scheduled Tribe) Sevak Sangh and Kasturba (wife of Mahatma Gandhi) National Memorial Trust.This segment of nutrition programme is thus implemented essentially by non-governmental organisations.The Central welfare Board, which may be a semi-government umbrella organisation within the field of welfare work , gives successively , grants-in-aid to voluntary organisations to truly run the programme then do the opposite four national level voluntary organisations, which also extend assistance to varied voluntary organisations beside running some centres directly.The beneficiaries of SNP are basically from the disadvantaged section of the society like tribal/scheduled caste people, urban slum dwellers and also migrant labourers.The in -charge of the Balwadi Centre is an honorary worker, like Anganwadi worker of ICDS, and is paid an honorarium which is Rs.200 per month for trained and Rs. 150 for untrained.She is assisted by a helper who is additionally an honorary worker.The Balwadis not only provide supplemental nutrition but also take care of the social and emotional development of youngsters attending these Balwadis.


## Creches for youngsters of Working and Ailing Women

The scheme, implemented since 1975, has been designed to free the working, and in some cases ailing mothers, from the task of taking care of their children while they're on work or are sick.The coverage under the scheme is out there only to those children whose parent's total monthly income doesn't exceed Rs. 1800.Children generally belong to casual migrant vendors, construction labourers groups etc.The services available to the youngsters include sleeping and daycare facilities, supplementary nutrition, immunization, medicines, entertainment and checkups at weekly intervals.The scheme is implemented by the Central welfare Board which provides grants-in-aid to varied nongovernmental organisations to manage the creches.Two other national level voluntary organisations namely, Indian Council for Child Welfare and Bhartiya Admijati Sewak Sangh also implement this scheme.A total of 12470 creches are being run under this scheme; during 1993-94, covering 300 thousand children.Assistance to the tune of Rs. 230 million is being provided to the CSWB and voluntary organisations to implement the scheme.


## Wheat Based Supplementary Nutrition Programme

The scheme was started with the dual objective of providing supplementary nutrition to children and popularising wheat intake.Min of Food places at the disposal of the Department of girls and child Development about 100 thousand tonnes of wheat from the central reserves annually which Department, in turn, sub-allocates this wheat among States which utilise the wheat mostly to supply wheat based ready-to-eat nutrition supplements.With the spread of ICDS, this wheat or its products are increasingly being utilised for distribution of supplementary nutrition in ICDS and mid-day-meal programmes The wheat is supplied to the State Governments by the Food Corporation of India at an equivalent subsidised rates as for the general public distribution system.


## World Food Programme Project

World Food Programme-UN provides food-stuffs in order that supplementary nutrition might be provided through the projects supported by them.WFP-India project has been extended from time to time and therefore the present extension would last till the top of March 1995.WFP currently supports 12 projects in India, with a complete commitment of 292 million dollars worth of food aid."The major a part of WFP's assistance to India supports projects in forestry, irrigation and supplementary nutrition.WFP's food assistance to India is concentrated on poverty alleviation, directly targeting the foremost vulnerable section of the society" (WFP News letter April 94).The WFP provides Soya Fortified Bulger Wheat, Corn Soya Blend and edible oil to profit about 2.1 million pre-school children, expectant and nursing mothers.For the last three years approximately , the WFP obtains wheat or rice locally from the Food Corporation of India in exchange for the butter oil it gets as donation from some European countries.


## CARE Assisted Nutrition Programmes

Under the Indo-CARE Agreement of 1950, CARE-India extends food aid in order that supplementary nutrition are often provided to pre-school children aged but six years and expectant/nursing mothers.The CARE assistance is now dovetailed with ICDS projects and a few of the ICDS projects utilise this assistance for the nutrition component of the programme.The programme covers ICDS projects in 10 States of the Indian Union.CARE has also monetized oil received by it as donation for generating funds • Email: editor@ijfmr.com

worth Rs. 100 million for implementing activities supportive of ICDS programme.


## UNICEF Assistance for ladies and youngsters

India has been related to UNICEF since 1949 and is one among the main countries as far as activities of UNICEF are concerned.The activities are guided by the provisions of the plan of Action, the newest of which was signed between India and UNICEF on 30 May 1991 and extends up to 1995.During the Five year period, UNICEF is probably going to spend around U.S. $ 175 million in India from its general resources.UNICEF's assistance covers a good spectrum and is out there within the sectors of health, education, nutrition, water and sanitation, rural development urban basic services etc.Of course, the main target of all its programmes is actually on children and also on women, with the last word objective of higher child health survival & development.


## Material and Methods:

Many studies administered in human populations from developing countries indicated important deficiencies in macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates and fat resulting in protein-energy deficiencies), micronutrients (electrolytes, minerals and vitamins resulting in specific micronutrients deficiencies) or both .These works were very relevant because they permitted the identification of the foremost severely affected regions and consequent intervention by humanitarian organizations and native governments.However, local public survey are very useful in studying the consequences of various levels of malnutrition, since non-nutritional factors that affect humans are often controlled during this sort of evaluation.the utilization of models in malnutrition has brought an excellent deal of data to molecular mechanisms involved within the higher susceptibility to infections and also to immunodeficiencysecondary to under nutrition .The most employed models are adult feed with reduced amount of proteins, vitamins or micronutrients.the share of dietary restriction varies from 10 to 70%, consistent with different authors.As immunodeficiency related to prepubescent malnutrition underlies a staggering burden of infection-related morbidity, acute weanling models have also been explored to research the consequences of malnutrition.More recently, transgenic and knockout mice have also been employed to raised understand the mechanisms involved in higher susceptibility to infectious agents in malnourished.These numerous models allowed a growing understanding and characterization of the immunological disturbances triggered by undernutrition.Some samples of the foremost relevant findings during this research area are presented


## Conclusion

Because malnutrition has many causes, only multiple and synergistic interventions embedded in true multi sector programs are often effective a spread of actions are needed, including agricultural and micronutrient interventions and therefore the provision of safe beverage and sanitation, education about and support for better diets, special attention to gender issues and vulnerable groups like pregnant women and young children, and quality health services.Nutrition education about locally available protein-and micronutrient-rich plants is especially effective and sustainable.The goal specifically about hunger is to scale back extreme poverty and hunger ,empowerment of girls , improved maternal health, decreased child mortality, advances within the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental protection and global partnerships for development would directly or indirectly contribute to major reductions of malnutrition in developing local areas and countries.

Integration & Correlation with Ancient Indian Literature:

The system plays an important role within the body's ability to fight infection and reduce the danger of developing autoimmune and degenerative disorders.On the worldwide scale it's been accepted that malnutrition, in its both forms under nutrition and over nutrition contributes to higher mortality and morbidity.Ayurveda, the traditional wisdom recommends various food items and behaviours for physical and mental well being.This work aims to reveals the hidden secrets of Ayurveda dietetics and immunity through comprehensive review of obtainable literature.Taking leads from Ayurveda the consequences of various food products with specific nutrient on immune reaction is discussed to offer the clinical insight into the age old doctrines of Ayurveda associated with diet for promoting and preserving health.This review has profound clinical and public health implication.This may boost the thought of nutritional manipulation of system as an innovative powerful tool to scale back illness and death caused by different communicable and non disease .(MamtaTiwari, Anurag Pandey, Anurag Agrawal 2014)



(Agarwal, D.,2008, Beck, M.A., 2007).Immunodeficiency suppression that results to cause complement system disturbance, decreasedbiological function of various cell types -B lymphocytes, macrophages and Kupffer cells, severe protein malnutrition in newborns, atrophy within the so called primary lymphoid organs, consequences are devastating because these organs are generators of B and T cell repertoires, provokes thymus atrophy, affects the event of peripheral lymphoid organs, reduces thymus cell number, leucopenia, decreased CD4/CD8 ratio and increased number of immature T cells within the periphery and cause the changes in thymic epithelial cells related to decreased thymic hormone production, changes within the architecture of gut mucosa including flattened hypotrophia microvilli, reduced lymphocyte counts in Peyer's patches and reduced immunoglobulin alongside secretion, hormonal imbalance, involving a decrease in leptin and a consequent increase in glucocorticoid hormone levels in serum(Fock, R.A.,2007, França,T.G.D.,2009, Scrimshaw, N.S.199, Beisel, W.R., 1996, Stapleton, P.P.2008, Savino, W., 2002, Xavier, J.G.,(2007).The strong relationship between malnutrition and infection characterized by lower weight relative to age, and better mortality indexes related to many infectious diseases there the one-third of the world's population is infected with M. tuberculosis bacterial infection, pneumonia, croup and encephalitis provokes death among infectious diseases with the virus infection and pathophysiological responses within the alimentary canal like vomiting, diarrhea and malabsorptionintestinal nematodes provoke malnutrition that clearly affect the nutritional status are soil transmitted helminths, Giardia duodenalis, Entamoebahistolytica, coccidia and Schistosomasp (Rice, A.L.,2000, Schaible, U.E. 2007, Chong, V.H., 2008, Hesham, M.S.,2004, Nnoaham, K.E.2008, Pelletier, D.L.,1994).




Recent studies in individuals of over 90 years old suggest that around 50% suffer from malnutrition and this population group is rapidly growing and affecting particularly greatly increases susceptibility to severity of infections in many pregnant women and young children in developing countries(Schofield,C.1996,Müller,O.2005,Bhan, M.K.,2003).Many factors affect the degree and distribution of PEM and micronutrient deficiency round the world, with poverty, socioeconomic and political instability, impaired educational development, unsanitary conditions, poor food practices, breast-feeding habits and shortage or ineffectiveness of nutrition programs (Oumeish, O.Y. (2003)
million people in world.abnormal bodycomposition,underweight and or overweight and obesity causes the changes in functionalcharacteristics as poor glucose homeostasis or hyperlipidaemia, hyper and hypo proteinemia, hyperand hypolipidemia, growth and development of organs across the life course, including immunedevelopment, and its performance and malnutritionetc (Sakurada, S.,2000, Vidueiros, S.M.,2008,Ahima, R.S.,1996).Malnutrition is often a consequence of energy deficit (protein-energy malnutrition -PEM) or amicronutrient deficiency that results as vitamin and mineral deficiencies, including iron, foliateand vitamin D , are common and contribute to diseases like osteoporosis, which affects quite three
(Alam, N.H. 2003ic capacity, body composition and level of demandfor energy and nutrients are all influenced by levels of physical activity and might vary consistent with different physiological and pathological or disease states (Prentice, A.M., 2000).Nutritional requirements (both maximum and minimum) may vary consistent with factors including age, sex, weight, and genotype, level of activity, physiological status (eg.growth, pregnancy and lactation) and therefore the presence or absence of disease(Man, W.D.C.,1998).During the first years of life nutritional needs are constantly changing which play the key role in lifelong health including in healthy ageing(Alam, N.H. 2003).The quality and the quantity both standards those fulfil the demand for human growth they are consists with carbohydrate, lipid essential fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, vitamins, trace elements, water, oxygen as the part of food quality and quantity for the food energy from macronutrients, carbohydrate, lipid [fat], protein of nutrients is vital for ensuring optimal healthy growth (Van Heerden, S.M.2004).To the demands under consideration physical activity ,stressors and underlyingpathology, behavioural, physiological processes like mucosal integrity and barrier function (eg respiratory, gastrointestinal),cognitive function and immune reaction , inflammatory process and ageing (Vidueiros, S.M., 2008, Yang, H.M.,2005).Imbalances in diet health as
