## (s9) Effect of Therapy on HbA1c Levels
(p9.0) HbAc1 level is a common and effective indicator of the mean glucose level over a long period (2 to 3 months). It provides a much better understanding of long-term glycaemic control than blood and urinary glucose measures. HbAc1 is directly linked to the proportion of glucose bound to the hemoglobin molecules, which occurs continually over the entire life span of the erythrocyte. 24 Diabetic patients with very high blood glucose concentrations have 2 to 3 times more HbA1c than normal individuals. The levels of HbAc1 act as effective indicators of the success or failure of the treatment. Upon treatment, all trials observed a significant decrease in the levels of HbAc1 during the three-month follow-up period and a further decline during the 12-month follow-up period. In one study, T1 ( Figure 5), the HbAc1 level did not change due to the increased nephropathy in diabetic patients. 25
