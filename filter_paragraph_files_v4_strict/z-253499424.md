## (s18) Hybrid Polygon Mesh Generation
(p18.0) In practical applications, due to various nonideal conditions, it is often impossible to generate only a single basic facet. Therefore, some researchers have designed hybrid mesh generation algorithms out of active or passive intention. However, due to the limitation of their application, there are only a few types of IMG with hybrid meshes as the generation target. In the literature that we searched, only BP-ANN [114], AnalyticMesh [101] and PolyGen [70] belong to this category. BP-ANN generates anisotropic quadrilateral and isotropic triangular meshes by the advancing front method, which improves the level of automation and efficiency of hybrid mesh generation. AnalyticMesh marches among analytic cells to recover the exact mesh of the closed, piecewise planar surface captured by an implicit surface network. The algorithm is applicable to more advanced MLP architectures, including those with shortcut connections and max pooling operations, which support a richer set of architectural designs for learning and exactly meshing complex surface shapes. Polygen more compactly represents the surface of the object with different polygons.
