## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) The initial inspiration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to imitate human perception, e.g., seeing, hearing, touching, smelling. In general, a modality is often associated with a specific sensor that creates a unique communication channel, such as vision and language [1]. In humans, a fundamental mechanism in our sensory perception is the ability to leverage multiple modalities of perception data collectively in order to engage ourselves properly with the world under dynamic unconstrained circumstances, with each modality serving as a distinct information source characterized by different statistical properties. For example, an image gives the visual appearance of an "elephants playing in water" scene via thousands of pixels, whilst the corresponding text describes this moment with a sentence using discrete words. Fundamentally, a multimodal AI system needs to ingest, interpret, and reason about multimodal information sources to realize similar human level perception abilities. Multimodal learning (MML) is a general approach to building AI models that can extract and relate information from multimodal data [1].

What is the purpose of multimodal learning in artificial intelligence, and how does it mimic human sensory perception?
