(p7.0) Adept Ò (Icodextrin 4% solution; Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA): Adept Ò is a clear solution containing icodextrin at a concentration of 4%. Icodextrin is an a-1-4linked glucose polymer and is responsible for the longer absorption time of Adept Ò compared to the previously used crystalloid instillates like lactated Ringer's solution, which is rapidly resorbed by the peritoneum and therefore not suitable for adhesion prevention. At the end of a procedure, 1,000 ml of Adept Ò is instilled into the abdominal cavity. Instillates separate the injured tissue by hydroflotation and should stay in the abdominal cavity during the first days after surgery. Adept Ò is absorbed by the lymphatic system within 4 days and is metabolised by alpha-amylase to lower molecular weight oligosaccharides. In a large randomised controlled trial Adept Ò showed significantly higher adhesion reduction compared with lactated Ringer's solution. An adverse effect of Adept Ò is the labial or vulval swelling which mostly resolves after a short period. Adept Ò is contraindicated in patients with allergy to cornstarch-based polymers, maltose or isomaltose intolerance or with glycogen storage disease. However, all in all Adept Ò is a safe, effective and affordable antiadhesion agent [56,57].
