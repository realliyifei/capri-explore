## (s11) Other Application
(p11.0) Secretome is reported to have antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial is a compound that can inhibit or suppress the growth of microbes. Various drugs that are resistant to microbes continue to increase. The use of secretome can be one of the alternatives to prevent drug resistance. In some studies, secretome is known to release antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin LL-37, calprotectin, hepcidin, RNase3, lipocalin-2 and human Î²-defensins. 37 Yagi et al reported secretome of adipose tissue is able to suppress the growth of S. aureus through increased activity of cathelicidin. 65 Harman et al investigated the antibacterial effects of secretome on bacteria found in skin wounds, tested using S. aureus and E. coli. The results showed that the use of secretome can inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and gram negative E. coli from the production of secreted factors that can affect bacterial membranes. 90
