## (s2) Background
(p2.0) Bell's palsy is named after Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842). Although he was the first to present the anatomical basis of Bell's palsy, recent research has revealed that other European practitioners contributed earlier clinical descriptions and accounts of the seventh peripheral cranial nerve palsy [7]. The first case report of idiopathic facial paralysis is believed to have been published by an 18th-century medicine professor, Nicolaus Friedrich, in Wurzburg. The case report described three middle-aged men with similar episodes of unilateral facial paralysis, which was subacute or acute in origin and gradually bettered in a few weeks to months. Later, Charles Bell studied facial nerve function in animals. He encountered several unilateral facial nerve paralysis cases during his surgical practice in London. His most well-known and widely cited case of facial palsy was posted in 1828, in which he presented a matter of a man hit by a bull and the resulting injury caused perpetual facial nerve paralysis [8].
