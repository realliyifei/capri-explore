## (s21) How Was Theory Used to Inform the Connections between Metrics and Outcomes (RQ4)?
(p21.0) Our final research question aims to understand the use of theory in past MMCA research. There is a growing consensus on the importance of theory in multiple stages of research for quantitative social sciences research (e.g., [17,121]). While this is often argued for, there is less empirical evidence on the ways or degree to which prior work has actually employed theory. We attempt to fill this gap by looking at how theory has so far been integrated into research. We then identify the references used repeatedly in MMCA research, presenting a list of key theories that can inform research for each of the collaborative sub-dimensions in our taxonomy.
