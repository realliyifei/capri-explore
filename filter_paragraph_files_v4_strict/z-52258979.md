## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) The biometric attribute possessed by every individual measure distinctive and has the potential to acknowledge. Therefore, biometrics is used for authentication or recognition for many critical applications like access control, border control, immigration, forensic and law enforcement. Biometric authentication [1,2] system provides better security compared to password or token based authentication system. However, compromise of the stored templates is a critical problem in biometric system. Biometric spoofs can be created by an adversary for stolen template which can be used to have legitimate access to systems that employ the same biometric trait of the user. While knowledge can be forgotten and tokens can be lost or stolen, biometrics do not suffer from these deficiencies and can provide the security of long passwords without sacrificing the ease of memorizing short ones.
