## (s13) Outcome quality of life (QoL)
(p13.0) There is nearly no literature available on the change of the quality of life due to implants in patients with antiresorptive therapy. One article could be identified [44] that analyzed the quality of life in partially edentulous osteoporosis patients that were restored with (1) a dental implant-supported prosthesis, (2) a non-implantsupported fixed restoration, (3) a non-implant-supported removable restauration, and (4) no restoration that showed a statistically significant difference regarding the improvement of the QoL in patients with a dental implant-supported prosthesis compared to the other sub-groups. Out of the 237 patients, 134 patients had an oral BP and 51 patients an IV BP therapy [44].
