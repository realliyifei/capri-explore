## (s26) V Integrability for Scattering Amplitudes c 2010 Niklas Beisert
(p26.0) The most conservative application of quantum field theories is to compute scattering cross sections (to be compared to particle scattering experiments). With old blades sharpened and new ones developed, the charted territory of tree and loop scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM has increased dramatically, see e.g. the recent reviews [18] and the special issue [19]. It was soon noticed that something special was going on in the planar limit which makes amplitudes much simpler than originally thought. It does not take much imagination to conjecture a connection to integrability. This part reviews scattering amplitudes and what integrability implies in this context. This topic is under active investigation, many advances have been and are being made, but a lot remains to be understood. Here, one can expect that integrability will enable a similarly simple solution as in the case of the planar spectrum.
