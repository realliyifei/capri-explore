## (s5) Puberty induced gingival enlargement
(p5.0) It is infl ammatory type of gingival enlargement which occurs in both male and females in pubertal age groups. it involves mainly marginal and interdental gingiva ( Figure   3). It is characterised by prominent bulbous interproximal papilla. After puberty the enlargement undergoes spontaneous reduction but does not disappear until local irritants are removed [7]. Some studies have found that pre threshold serum phenytoin was directly aenlargement, while no association was found post threshold phenytoin and gingival enlergment. Girgis et al found a direct relationship between gingival enlargement in 50% of patients, while no relationship and even an inverse relationship was found in rest 50% [2].
