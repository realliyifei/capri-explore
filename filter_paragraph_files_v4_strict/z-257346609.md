## (s4) Support Vector Machines
(p4.0) Support vector machines (SVM) are designed for binary classification in a multidimensional space. The working principle of SVM involves the identification of a hyperplane, a boundary that separates outcome categories to their full extent [18]. SVM applies a data transformation to the sample data and projects it to a desired dimensional space that is higher via a kernel function. A kernel function is defined as a function that returns the inner product (dot product) between the images of two data points (x, x') in the higherdimensional space. ML then takes place in this space [24]. An example of a dot product between x ij and x ij ' can be mathematically shown below:
