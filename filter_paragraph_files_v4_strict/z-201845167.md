## (s13) Conclusions
(p13.0) The use of restraints in a non-psychiatric healthcare setting can involve some blurred lines due to the use of direct and indirect restraints. It was found that the justification used was to prevent the incidence of patient falls, but restraints were also implemented to ease pressures brought about by staff shortages. The finding that the use of restraint decreased when there was a better nursing skill mix involved in patient care was particularly interesting. It is consistently found that having more educated and experienced nursing staff leads to better patient outcomes [51,52]. Therefore, by increasing staff knowledge of the subject matter, less restraint could be implemented in reducing falls and pressures on decreased staffing levels. Techniques such as having open lines of communication between staff and patients can avoid the need for mobilisation and the incidence of falls. Admittedly, this adds more roles to an already stretched workforce; however, these techniques when implemented will still reduce the use of restraint and reduce the length of hospital stays [45].
