## (s1) Furin cleavage site
(p1.0) Several kinds of CoV, from various genera, have at their S1/ S2 binding site a furin cleavage site (FCS) (Belouzard et al., 2012). An important phase in the life cycle of the CoV is the human cell entry and fusion derived from proteolytic activity of the relative fusion protein (FP) by respective proteases (Jaimes & Whittaker, 2018). A conventional approach to explore the CoV life cycle is to clone the FP gene into an appropriate vector, transfect the cells, incubate with the related protease, purify the protein and carry out the protein assays (Cong et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019). This approach shows a number of drawbacks: the need of viral genome, expensive synthesizing process, availability of monoclonal antibodies, and time-consuming process. Therefore, Jaimes et al. (2019) reported the fluorogenic peptide cleavage analysis to assay the proteolytic activity of recombinant FP which can be applied in the case of CoV SP in a less labor and time intensive way.
