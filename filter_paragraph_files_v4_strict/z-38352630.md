## (s54) Model error in 4DEnVar
(p54.0) Accounting for model error in methods that do not use the linearized model, like hybrid 4DEnVar, is more in line with the requirements of many operational centres, but is arguably harder to do and there are few examples in the literature. The key is to build flexibility into a scheme to relax the need for the solution to be synthesized from model trajectories over the window. One possibility, based around the B05 localization is to allow a different linear combination of members at each time (Amezcua et al., 2017;Goodliff et al., 2017). Instead of one control vector associated with the ensemble, χ ens in (79), there would be T +1 such vectors. The versions of (78) and (79) become (87) and (88) respectively, J H4DEnVar δχ var , χ ens (0), . . . , χ ens (T)
