## (s9) Early Childhood Caries
(p9.0) The stomatognathic system is affected by ECC which performs the functions such as breathing, sucking, chewing, and phonoarticulation. All these functions are related to the integrity of dental arch. The early loss of incisors due to ECC may lead to the development of harmful oral habits and altered speech development. 33 It also compromises the child's quality life, as the early loss of teeth affects Esthetics, nutrition, speech development, dental arch integrity, and development and eruption of permanent successor teeth and contributes to the establishment of deleterious oral habits. 34 The strategies of myofunctional therapy are isotonic exercises for mobility of the tongue and cheek, isometric exercises to tone cheek, and awareness of the correct chewing pattern.
