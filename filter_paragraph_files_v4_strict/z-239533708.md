## (s26) Zinc Layered Hydroxide
(p26.0) LH has a 2D inorganic layered structure, which is composed of a single metal hydroxide. Zn-LH is the most common one used to host various AI guests for the synthesis of nanopesticides that can be found in the literature, as shown in Table 4. For example, isoprocarb and carbamate were separately intercalated into the Zn-LH for the formation of their nanoinsecticides, resulting in better thermal stability and environmental friendliness of the AI compared with their counterparts [61,62]. Table 4. Nanopesticides synthesized using host-guest supramolecular chemistry using zinc-layered hydroxide as the host and various AIs as the guest for various targets and advantages.
