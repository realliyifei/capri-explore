## (s14) Comparison of Results
(p14.0) This study found many articles in which the results of their models had been compared with state of the art models, such as refs. [2][3][4][5]. As these models were built some years ago, they have been more cited so are easier to find during a search on the digital libraries. For example, ref. [5] has been cited 2855 times, according to Google Scholar from Google, while most of the newest articles found have not been cited at all yet, or the ones written in 2018 have usually been cited less than 10 times. Not surprisingly the newer the articles are, the further at the bottom of the search they appear, so most researchers might not even find them if not enough time has been dedicated for a literature review. Figures 1-6 confirm that results are not steadily increasing-there are many results which are not higher than the ones from a year ago. This can undoubtedly be due to the topic difficulty, but also lack of details can lower the goals of researchers so they do not improve knowing that there are higher results already even though a very important part for researchers is to compare their work results with similar approaches. In this study the results from the newest models are presented so upcoming researchers can compare their models with regard to the newest achievements. We hope this research will help further researchers to save their time on detailed literature reviews and to keep in mind the importance of checking for the newest articles.
