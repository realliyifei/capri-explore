## (s4) Factors Influencing the Individual Response to rTMS
(p4.0) In the last decade, genetic factors in humans have been a crucial topic of discussion in clinical research. The main hypothesis is that common genetic variants might contribute to genetic risk for some diseases and may compromise the subject's response to TMS [35,36]. We can speculate that a profound knowledge of genetic variants may help to predict whether participants will respond to rTMS and the direction in which the modulation will take place. The Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) gene has been related to the individual response to rTMS. The BDNF gene has 13 exons and encodes a precursor peptide (pro-BDNF), which in turn is cleaved to form the mature protein. A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) located at nucleotide 196 (guanine (G)/ Adenosine (A)) has been identified. The result is an amino acid substitution Valine (Val)-to-Methionine (Met) at codon 66, and it has been hypothesized that SNP located in the pro-BDNF alters intracellular processing and secretion of BDNF [37]. In healthy subjects, it has been related to mild memory impairments, reduction in hippocampal and frontal cortical areas and some personality traits [37]. This Val66Met polymorphism could also be related to psychiatric disorders such as depression and risk of schizophrenia and to the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) [37].
