## (s2) Two Sides of PFA: Pro-and Anti-Arrhythmic Effects
(p2.0) The key mechanism of PFA is the application of high-energy and short-duration electric fields to induce irreversible electroporation (IRE). However, the effect of PFA on cardiomyocytes may also be transient; pores may be resealable and the cells could preserve the vitality, which is called reversible electroporation (RE). After the delivery of PFA, the magnitude of electric fields around the electrodes decreased from the electrodes outward into the tissue. The nature of these fields is such that immediately near the electrodes there is a region in which they cause IRE. Meanwhile, these regions were surrounded by other regions with lower electric fields, in which RE was induced. In both regions of IRE and RE, the enhanced cell membrane permeability may open a channel for ion transport, which may trigger various arrhythmias [10]. One study has investigated the possibility of developing arrhythmias resulting from the enhanced cell permeability induced by electrical pulses but found no dysrhythmias on the ECG [11].
