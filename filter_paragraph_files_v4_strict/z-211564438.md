## (s2) Mutant Isocitrate Dehydrogenases Inhibit NAD Production in Cancer
(p2.0) Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) converts isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the TCA cycle with NADP + as its cofactor. IDH exists in three isozymes, namely IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3. IDH1, located in the cytosol and peroxisome, is encoded by the IDH1 gene on chromosome 2q34, while IDH2 is localized in the mitochondria and is encoded by the gene located on chromosome 15q26.1 [41]. Both enzymes are NADP-dependent, share high degree of homology and conduct a reversible reaction to maintain the isocitrate pool [12]. Unlike the other two isozymes, IDH3, localized in the mitochondria, exists as a heterocomplex enzyme consisting of α, β, and γ subunits that are encoded by IDH3A (15q25.1), IDH3B (20p13), and IDH3C (Xq28) genes, respectively [41]. IDH3 is activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inhibited by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In order to ensure the continuity of TCA cycle, IDH3 conducts the irreversible conversion of isocitrate to maintain the α-KG pool [12,41,81].
