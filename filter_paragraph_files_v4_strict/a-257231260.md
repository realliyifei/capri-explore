## (s2) Study Selection
(p2.0) Three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched for all available articles written in English. The search was restricted to the 20 years following the publication date of the seminal works that prompted evidence-based checklists to enhance the quality of scientific reports. 3,12 The initial search was undertaken by 3 authors (L.V., A.M., G.M.). The search included Medical Subject Headings, key words, and matching synonyms relevant to the topic. The search strategies employed in the databases are presented in Supplemental Digital Content 2, available at: http://links.lww. com/JNPT/A417.

LLM judge: NO

The analysis shows that this content does not meet several of the outlined criteria:
1. The text refers to non-textual elements ("Supplemental Digital Content 2") and includes a URL, which implies that it relies on external resources for complete understanding.
2. It mentions references in a manner ("3,12") that suggests important details might be scattered or reliant on the full paper or external content, which disrupts the self-contained nature expected.
3. The content primarily describes a methodology without providing substantive findings or conclusions, lacking comprehensive context on its own.
Other concerns: It does not form a coherent narrative or standalone summary that can be clearly addressed with a single question, further failing the criteria for cohesiveness and self-containment.
