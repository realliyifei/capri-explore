Introduction:The drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022, for the first time for any indication or under any brand, were studied under the contexts of indications, mechanism of action, and side effects.Primary care practitioners with considering patients as a composite whole will benefit by acquainting themselves with these drugs and their indications and adverse effects.Observations: The drugs were approved in all, 11 for the management of neoplasia, and 5 each for hematological, neurological, and dermatological conditions.11 of the approved drugs are monoclonal antibodies and six are small molecule inhibitors.Conclusion: Although the FDA's expedited approval program allows rapid market availability of drugs for difficult to treat conditions, a quarter of the globe does not have access to essential medicines, primarily due to cost.In light of this, approval agencies must reorient approval processes to improve accessibility.

## Introduction

The drugs that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States (USA) approved in 2022 were categorized and studied chronologically, under the contexts of their indications, mechanisms of action, and adverse drug reactions.The list of drugs was sourced from the online aggregator, Drugs.com, [1]nd the data were collected from the United States Health Care Provider website for the respective drugs and in the case of nonavailability, from the FDA package insert.Approvals of already approved drugs for new indications, combinations of already approved drugs, and new proprietary versions of already approved drugs as well as approvals of vaccines and agents used in radiological investigations were not considered.After this, a total of 41 drugs were found to be approved.The drugs were classified based on the target of action, whereas infections and neoplasia of any organs were considered under those headings, and diseases secondary to another condition were considered under the directly affected system.Information was sourced from the official healthcare provider (hcp) websites of the approved drugs as well as the FDA labels.

Although the majority of the following list are drugs that are used by specialists, study will prove beneficial for primary care practitioners as well, because the majority of indications for which drugs were approved come within the realm of general practice.This may alter treatment algorithms and indications for referral.Furthermore, primary care physicians being the ones who deal with the patient at the moment of presentation and consider the body as an organic whole need to be aware of the entire list of new medications.Finally, primary care physicians will have to know about the complications of using the newly approved drugs and their management, as patients may present to them instead of specialists for these complaints.

## Observations

Tables 1 and 2 discuss the drugs approved by the FDA in 2022.

The approved drugs are classified based on the system of their action in Table 3.

13 of the 41 approved drugs (31.7%) were for the treatment of cancer, whereas five each (12.2%) were approved for the treatment of hematological, neurological, and dermatological diseases.Four of the 5 drugs approved in the field of dermatology were for the treatment of psoriasis whereas 3 of the 5 approved in the field of hematology were for the treatment of anemia.With regard to chemical structure, 11 of the approved drugs were monoclonal antibodies, whereas six are small molecular inhibitors.To facilitate the immediate market availability of medications for difficult to treat conditions, the Food and Drug Administration approves drugs through expedited review programs, such as priority review, fast track, breakthrough therapy, and accelerated approval.The approval of more drugs in particular areas could be indicative of the systemic support to increase availability of drugs.There are, however, stark economic implications.In the field of oncology, which featured first in the number of approvals by the FDA last year as well, [2] the cost implications of large-scale usage of newly approved drugs is disastrous. [3]The cost of cancer treatment is already quite imposing on a large number of American citizens. [4]This is worse in developing countries such as India, where catastrophic health expenditure due to cancer is extant, even in public sector institutions. [5]Thus, a tangential view would be to consider the accessibility of drugs to the average household.65% of Indians lack access to essential medicines, and drugs that act against curable diseases, primarily due to cost-considerations. [6] Globally, more than a fourth of the world's population does not have access to essential medicines. [6]When life-saving medications are unavailable to a large portion of the population, their purpose is lost. [7]In this vein, drug approval organizations should consider whether fast approval really means improved accessibility, while facilitating fast approval for pharmaceuticals.There is however one new drug-vonoprazan-with which therapy is more economical than previously available options. [8]The use of vonoprazan at the primary care level must be explored.


## Conclusion

A study of the drugs approved by the FDA, for the first time for any indication or under any brand, revealed that a total of 41 drugs were approved.13 of these drugs are for the treatment of cancer, and five each are for the treatment of hematological, neurological, and dermatological conditions.11 of the approved drugs are monoclonal antibodies, and six are small molecule inhibitors.Although the fast-track approval programs of the FDA allow the immediate market availability of medications for difficult to treat conditions, a quarter of the global population does not even have access to essential medicine.Thus, drug approval organizations must reconsider fast approval programs, orienting them along the lines of accessibility and the right to health.
