Background Adoption and outcomes for conduction system pacing (CSP), which includes His bundle pacing (HBP) or left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP), in real-world settings are incompletely understood. We sought to describe real-world adoption of CSP lead implantation and subsequent outcomes. Methods We performed an online cross-sectional survey on the implantation and outcomes associated with CSP, between November 15, 2020, and February 15, 2021. We described survey responses and reported HBP and LBBAP outcomes for bradycardia pacing and cardiac resynchronization CRT indications, separately. Results The analysis cohort included 140 institutions, located on 5 continents, who contributed data to the worldwide survey on CSP. Of these, 127 institutions (90.7%) reported experience implanting CSP leads. CSP and overall device implantation volumes were reported by 84 institutions. In 2019, the median proportion of device implants with CSP, HBP, and/or LBBAP leads attempted were 4.4% (interquartile range [IQR], 1.9-12.5%; range, 0.4-100%), 3.3% (IQR, 1.3-7.1%; range, 0.2-87.0%), and 2.5% (IQR, 0.5-24.0%; range, 0.1-55.6%), respectively. For bradycardia pacing indications, HBP leads, as compared to LBBAP leads, had higher reported implant threshold (median [IQR]: 1.5 V [1.3-2.0 V] vs 0.8 V [0.6-1.0 V], p = 0.0008) and lower ventricular sensing (median [IQR]: 4.0 mV [3.0-5.0 mV] vs. 10.0 mV [7.0-12.0 mV], p < 0.0001).Conclusion In conclusion, CSP lead implantation has been broadly adopted but has yet to become the default approach at most surveyed institutions. As the indications and data for CSP continue to evolve, strategies to educate and promote CSP lead implantation at institutions without CSP lead implantation experience would be necessary.

# Introduction

His bundle pacing (HBP) and left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) have emerged as two approaches to pace the conduction system [1,2], with mounting evidence that conduction system pacing (CSP) avoids the deleterious effects of right ventricular myocardial pacing [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Peerreviewed publications on CSP have risen rapidly since 2017 [11], along with multiple national meetings on the topic, in parallel with CSP becoming a common topic of discussion on social media platforms (such as Twitter) within the electrophysiology community [12]. However, other than a marked increase in the use of the SelectSecure 3830 lead (Medtronic; Minneapolis, MN) in 2017 [11], historically the only option to perform CSP, there is little known about real-world adoption of CSP lead implantation or subsequent outcomes. Previously, worldwide surveys have been successfully utilized to study emerging techniques in electrophysiology [13,14].

Therefore, we sought to perform a worldwide survey on CSP with HBP and LBBAP leads to determine institutional: (1) implantation experience, (2) implantation approach, and (3) outcomes for bradycardia pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) indications.


# Methods

We performed an online cross-sectional survey on implantation of and outcomes for CSP (i.e., HBP and/or LBBAP). The survey was available for completion starting November 15, 2020, until February 15, 2021 The survey was open to all institutions regardless of location, academic affiliation, or experience with CSP. Recurring survey advertisements were disseminated to Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology's over 4000 Twitter followers (@CirculationEP), with tweets tagged with "#dontdistheHis" and "#EPeeps", and its electronic mailing list, which includes over 1800 contributors. All electrophysiology fellowship program directors in the USA were also notified of the survey [15]. Up to 100 institutions that provided survey data were offered a single authorship position, with authorship determined based on completeness of provided data and on a first-come first-served basis. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. The research protocol was reviewed by the institutional review board at Stanford University and granted an exemption from approval as it was determined to not involve human subjects.

The survey was developed by authors A. C. P., P. J. W., P. V., and P. S. S. with 73 questions across the following 5 sections: (1) institutional demographics; (2) CSP lead implantation experience; (3) CSP lead implantation procedural approach; (4) CSP outcomes for bradycardia pacing indications (short-term device outcomes, long-term device outcomes, and cardiomyopathy outcomes); and (5) CSP outcomes for CRT indications (short-term device outcomes, long-term device outcomes, and cardiomyopathy outcomes). Assignment of device indication (bradycardia pacing vs. CRT) was made at the discretion of the survey respondent, based on the primary indication for device implant. The complete survey is available in the supplemental material.

We included all survey responses with at least one answered question. Exclusion criteria included survey responses (1) with nonsensical institution name, respondent last name, and respondent email address; (2) that were duplicates from the same respondent; (3) that were duplicates from the same institution (different respondents); (4) with missing experience with CSP leads; and (5) from institutions with no device implanters. For duplicate surveys, we included the most complete survey or the most recent survey if completeness was equal. We defined CSP experience as self-report of any attempted HBP or LBBAP lead implants at the surveyed institution. For CSP experienced institutions, we described surveyed institutions' (1) index year CSP pacing lead implantation was attempted, (2) proportion of device (i.e., pacemaker or CRT) and pacemaker implants with CSP lead implantations attempted by year, (3) percent of proceduralists attempting and routinely implanting CSP pacing leads by device indication (i.e., bradycardia pacing vs. CRT), (4) percent of proceduralists utilizing various approaches to HBP lead implantation, (5) preprocedural exclusion criteria for CSP, and (6) selection of HBP versus LBBAP implantation sites. Results were reported for any CSP, HBP only, and LBBAP only and summarized by count and percentages when categorical and median with interquartile range (IQR) when continuous. We selected 2019 as the primary year of interest, to avoid COVID-19-related effects on overall device volume and CSP lead implantation. If the proportion of device or pacemaker implants with CSP lead attempted were > 1.0, which would be possible if CSP lead implantation was an institution's default approach and HBP and LBBAP lead implantation were both attempted in some cases, we defined the proportion as 1.0. We reported the number of institutions that provided data for each section that could not be completed offhand (e.g., number of CSP leads attempted per year). For CSP inexperienced institutions, we described surveyed institutions rationale for not attempting CSP lead implantation.

We compared surveyed institutions' baseline characteristics between CSP-experienced and CSP-inexperienced institutions, stratifying CSP-experienced institutions by whether they had experience with both HBP and LBBAP, only HBP, or only LBBAP. For bradycardia pacing and CRT indications, we separately compared HBP and LBBAP (1) short-term device outcomes (intraprocedural success, selective CSP, acute CSP threshold, ventricular sensing, procedure duration, acute lead revision); (2)  REDCap, version 11.1.0 (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), was used (1) by investigators to build and test the survey, (2) by respondents to complete the survey, and (3) for data management and export. All analyses were performed using STATA, version 17.0 (College Station, TX).


# Results

The analysis cohort included 140 institutions, located on 5 continents, who contributed data to the worldwide survey on CSP (Fig. 1). Of these, 127 institutions (90.7%) reported experience implanting CSP leads (i.e., HBP and/ or LBBAP). Of the 127 institutions, experience with both HBP and LBBAP was reported by 87 institutions (68.5%), only HBP by 38 institutions (29.9%), and only LBBAP by 2 institutions (1.6%). Performance of CSP for bradycardia pacing and CRT indications was reported by 110 institutions (91.2%) and 92 institutions (79.3%), respectively. As compared to CSP experienced institutions, CSP inexperienced institutions (N = 13) were less likely to be in the USA/Canada (7.7% vs. 36.2%, p = 0.03), with fewer device implanters (3.0 ± 1.4 vs. 5.8 ± 3.4, p = 0.01) ( Table 1). CSP-inexperienced institutions reported not attempting CSP primarily due to (1) increased procedural difficulty (e.g., low success rate, high implant threshold, etc.) (N = 5) and (2) lack of access to in-person proctoring for CSP (N = 4).

For CSP-experienced institutions, the first year HBP lead implantation was attempted was 1999 (N = 1), with 96% of HBP-experienced institutions not attempting CSP and overall device implantation volumes were reported by 84 institutions, with 177,308 device implants included with a CSP lead attempted in 13,196 (7.4%). In 2019, the median proportion of device implants with CSP, HBP, and/or LBBAP leads attempted were 4.4% (interquartile range [IQR], 1.9-12.5%; range, 0.4-100%), 3.3% (IQR, 1.3-7.1%; range, 0.2-87.0%), and 2.5% (IQR, 0.5-24.0%; range, 0.1-55.6%), respectively. From 2014 to 2020, the median proportion of device implants with CSP leads attempted was numerically similar (2014, 2.9%; 2020, 6.6%). However, the number of institutions with ≥ 50% of device implants with CSP leads attempted numerically increased (2014, 0; 2020, 11) (Fig. 3). For pacemaker implants only, the median proportion with CSP leads attempted in 2019 was 5.9% (IQR, 2.6-20.0%; range, 0.6-100.0%) (Supplemental Fig. 1). At CSP-experienced institutions in 2019, 48.6% and 58.9% of institutions had < 5% of proceduralists implanting CSP leads as a default strategy for bradycardia pacing and CRT indications, respectively. CSP lead implantation had been attempted by ≥ 95% of proceduralists for bradycardia pacing and CRT indications at 13.9% and 4.6% of institutions, respectively (Fig. 4). The most frequently reported CSP exclusion criteria for bradycardia pacing and CRT indications were AV block (14.5%) and no attempt at coronary sinus lead implantation (35.8%), respectively. No preprocedural CSP exclusion criteria for bradycardia pacing and CRT indications were reported by 63.5% and 48.1% of institutions, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 2). HBP, as compared to LBBAP, was more frequently the default CSP approach (bradycardia pacing, 55.9% vs. 18.6%; CRT, 50% vs. 17.8%) (Supplemental Fig. 3). For HBP lead implantation, the approaches with greatest variability across institutions were use of (1) an electrophysiology recording system to visualize intracardiac electrograms (SD: 1.64) and (2) backup right ventricular pacing for pacemaker-dependent patients (SD: 1.62) (Fig. 5).

Short-term and long-term outcome data on CSP procedures were reported by 84 and 75 institutions, respectively. For bradycardia pacing indications, HBP leads, as compared to LBBAP leads, had higher implant threshold ( Table 3).


# Discussion

In the first-ever worldwide survey of CSP, we found that CSP lead implantation has been attempted on at least 5 continents. However, overall proportion of device cases for which CSP lead implantation is attempted remains low   at most CSP-experienced institutions. In fact, only 11 out of 78 institutions providing data in 2020 attempted CSP lead implantation in more than 50% of device cases. These findings highlight both the extent of experimentation with CSP lead implantation across the electrophysiology community and that a limited number of institutions and proceduralists are implanting CSP leads as a default strategy for bradycardia pacing and CRT indications.

In a special report by Barakat et al. [11], trends in implantation of the SelectSecure 3830 lead suggested that approximately 15,096 CSP leads had been implanted in the USA from 2017 to 2018. Over this time period, worldwide CSP survey respondents from the USA, who contributed data on CSP lead implantation volume, reported implantation of 1184 CSP leads, representing 7.8% of the estimated US CSP volume. Importantly, a larger volume of CSP leads were reported to have been implanted by survey respondents not located in the USA (2472 CSP leads from 2017 to 2018) and 34% of survey respondents did not report CSP lead implantation volume. As such, the worldwide CSP survey appears to have collected data on a non-trivial proportion of all implanted CSP leads to date.

A key finding of the worldwide CSP survey is that although many institutions have attempted CSP, few implant CSP leads as a default strategy, regardless of indication. Similarly, across institutions, most proceduralists at surveyed institutions are not implanting CSP leads as a default strategy. At CSP inexperienced institutions, the primary reasons for not attempting CSP were increased procedural difficulty and lack of access to in-person proctoring for CSP, which may generalize to CSP experienced institutions who do not implant CSP leads as a default strategy. If indications for CSP lead implantations continue to expand, these findings highlight the need identify strategies to promote CSP lead implantation at institutions with and without CSP lead implantation experience.

Paradoxically, institutions reported superior short-and long-term outcomes for LBBAP leads, as compared to HBP leads, with lower and more durable pacing thresholds, higher ventricular sensing, less CSP lead revisions, and fewer coronary sinus lead upgrades. These findings are consistent with what has been reported in the literature [16]. We did not inquire as to why this discrepancy is present. However, it may be due to the literature on LBBAP outcomes being relatively less mature as compared to HBP. As the evidence base for LBBAP and HBP develops, particularly clinical outcomes associated with each approach, it will be interesting to see if HBP lead implantation remains the default CSP approach world-wide. For HBP lead implantation, the largest variability in implantation approach was seen with whether (1) an electrophysiology recording system was used to visualize intracardiac electrograms (i.e., other than the pacing system analyzer); and (2) a backup right ventricular pacing lead was implanted for pacemaker dependent patients. We did not inquire about variability in LBBAP implantation. Importantly, CSP leads and implantation tools were only available commercially from Medtronic for the majority of the surveyed time period [17]. However, other vendors have since entered the CSP lead implantation space and variability in implantation approaches would be expected to increase with unknown effects on adoption and outcomes [18,19].

Although the worldwide CSP survey appears to have captured a relatively large proportion of the overall volume of devices implanted with CSP leads, it is plausible that results may not be applicable to CSP-experienced institutions that did not participate in the survey. For example, included institutions were predominantly academic with a relatively Values are median (interquartile range) or n (%) unless otherwise specified.

As such, results may not generalize to dissimilar institutions. A complete list of institutions that implant devices world-wide was not available for survey distribution, making determination of the exact survey response rate impossible. Additionally, reported data was taken at face value without audit. Importantly, only a small number of CSP-inexperienced institutions participated in the survey and insight is limited into why institutions have not attempted CSP lead implantation.


# Conclusions

In conclusion, CSP lead implantation has been broadly attempted but has yet to become the default approach at most surveyed institutions. If indications for CSP continue to expand, strategies to promote CSP lead implantation at institutions with and without CSP experience will be needed.
