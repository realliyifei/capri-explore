## NOTE:

 Number needed to treat (NNT) = Number of cases that need to be treated to prevent one case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea  Options are based on 95% confidence interval of probiotics effectiveness in prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea ☐12% (NNT=13)
☐9% (NNT=10) ☐7 %( NNT=8)
☐I would not consider probiotic therapy for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea

8)Currently, there is a huge heterogeneity in clinical trials of pediatric acute diarrhea in terms of diarrhea definition and outcomes measured. We, therefore, aim to develop and validate an instrument to measure antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children to be used in future clinical trials. We would like to identify the most important and relevant outcomes to include in the instrument based on your opinions.On a scale of 1-9, please rate the importance of each potential beneficial outcome when considering probiotics for prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea:1= Not important at all (you do not feel it needs to be measured in clinical trials) 9= Critically important (you strongly believe it is important to measure in clinical trials)
