This study focused on primate distribution and abundance in yaaiwa and Ipinu-Igede Forest Reserves in Kwande and Oju local Government Areas of Benue State, Nigeria, respectively. The study also assessed the species of tree composition and abundance in addition to types of anthropogenic activities in these areas.The research period was from June, 2018 to May, 2019. The methods used were line transect method to determine their population density and the total enumeration count for plants species composition and abundance. Structural questionnaire were used to obtain information on anthropogenic disturbances in the study areas.Results revealed that population density of the three species of primates sighted in the study areas were very low, 1.68 individuals /km2 due to high rate of anthropogenic activities such as farming, hunting and logging in and around these study areas. However, the presence of three different species of primates such as olive Baboon (Papio Anubis), Patas monkey (Erythrocebus Patas) and Tantatus monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) were confirmed, through physical observations and indirect indices such as calls, dungs and foot prints. The plant species and ecology of the study areas were mainly of primary forest which was seriously modified through human activities. Clearly, most of the respondents were energetic youths of age between 16 -35 years, who were mostly said to be unemployed who posed threat to wildlife conservation in these study areas. However, awareness on the importance of wildlife (Primates) conservation should be carried out using radio and town criers in the state to reduce the rate of ignorance on Line Transect Method .Efforts should be made to adequately protect the study areas, through enactment of laws since they are still one of the few remaining locations in the state where some valuable tropical and indigenous tree species could be found

Primates belong to the same human family, mammalidae. Most primate populations are declining and many species are critically endangered or under threat of extinction due to excessive harvesting (deforestation), (cowlishaw and dunbar, 2000, schwitzer et al, 2014). Most of the word's primates are found in the tropic, Particularly the rainforest of lowland and ever green maintain forest of the tropical areas, with few in the savannah and other open habitats, (Richard, 1987 andAjayi, 2015). Most hunters target primates due to their large sizes and diaunal feeding behaviours, making them more vulnerable, (Ayodele, 2009). This reason is enough to ginger any primates conservation activities. Primates belong to the first position of the animal kingdom (Ajayi 2005) including man (Homosapien), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Baboons (Papio spp), just to mention a few. Researchers have found primates to be crucial in improving human health and well being (Bennett, 2015), ( Joyner et al, 2015). Therefore, it has become explicitly important that primates should be jealously conserved and preserved for now and future use.

However, the survival and continuity of many endemic, rare and threatened species found in a given rangeland depend on sustainable protection/conservation through its assessment to determine their current status, (Lameed, 2010). Primate conservation in Nigeria has been loosely addressed, despite the presence of several restricted-Ranges and critically endangered primates (Oates, 2008). This has clearly been linked to poverty, population growth, urbanization, insecurity and lack of awareness among our people. Furthermore, the growing demand for essential things like space, water, food, energy and waste disposal services continually transform the landscape we occupy.

The global strategy for primate conservation, which was created by the Primate Specialist Group, (PSG) in 1978, stated that some of the strategies include protecting vulnerable areas, creating public awareness towards the issues and marking large Reserves dedicated to the maintenance and preservation of biodiversity, (Oates, 1992).

Nigeria have a rich primates fauna as twenty one species have been recorded (Oates, 1992). The richness is attributable to the unique diversity of its ecosystem. More also, Nigeria's primate fauna is a mix of species from forest to Savannah ecological Zones.

Nigeria's only (cercopithecus sclater) is known only to exist in the Eastern part of Nigeria; (Oates et al, 1992;Baker et al. 2019). Primates have been little studied by field biologists. Most of the primates in these study areas have/are migrating to a relatively stable ecological Zones due to excessive harvesting (hunting), urbanization, farming, insecurity, value for primate meat (bushmeat) and lack of awareness for primate conservation by the local indigenes. and grasses ( Nyala, 1995) such as Khaya Senegalensis (Mahogany) found mostly along stream courses. Also, commonly found in these study areas are Daniella Oliveri, Isoberlina Doka, Park in biglobosa (locust bean tree), Prosopis africana (Iron tree), Vitellaria paradoxa (shea butter tree) and Burkea africana (oil bean tree).


## CLIMATE

Based on Koppen's Scheme of classification, Yaaiwa and Ipinu-Igede Forest Reserves are within the AW OR AS which is Tropical Wet and dry or Savannah climate with two distinct seasons (Wet from June to October and Dry from November to May) Figure 5, showed the Mean monthly trend of( 2016 -2018) Rainfall in Yariwa and Ipinu-igede Forest Reserves. It was observed that rain started falling in Yariwa Forest Reserve in March. The month of April had a total rainfall of (136mm), then a gradual rise in the month of May (151.7mm) and June (183mm) with a slight drop in July (161.7mm).

The rain rose again to (224mm) in August and reached it picks in September (302mm) and dropped to (140mm) in October and stopped in November. Whereas in Ipinu-igede Forest Reserve rain started falling in February and continue rising through March (130mm), April (189mm) and May (279mm). It dropped a little in June (240mm) and rose slightly in July(289mm) and a drastic drop in August(122mm). It rose to its pick in September (293mm).and dropped in October (126mm) andNovember (17mm) and finally stopped in December.


## METHODOLOGY

Primate species abundance and diversity were determined by both direct and indirect observations including using long Transects of 2km long. The distance between one transect line to another was 50m apart and observation was at random as described by Osunsina et al, (2012). This was in addition to household structured questionnaire, (HQS) to Respondents in the communities around the study areas.


## METHODS FOR SAMPLING PRIMATES POPULATION:

The sampling technique that was used for the population of primates was the line transect method as described by Peres (1999) and used by Basuta et al (2003); Ogogo et al (2010) and Ajayi et al (2011). The data collection was done in three phases:

Phase 1: Reconnaissance survey: This was carried out between 17th -27th January, 2018. During this period, all members of the survey team were involved in the selected and marking of transects. As a result of the rugged terraim which makes observation difficult, transects were selected from existing hunters' trails and farm roads, (Bassey, 2012). In selection and marking transects, the guidelines provided by Peres (1999) were followed. If an obstacle during field work, was observed, the compass man should divert the transect line, to create and offset and resume again at same bearing on the other side of the obstacle. Transect lengths of 2km long and 50m equal width was marked out using marking tapes and Ribbon.

Phase 2: First census (Morning 6:00am -9:00am). This was necessary as the primates were moving out in search for food.

This involves an individual observer walking the transect with a binocular/camera for sighting with a research data sheet for recording observations. These were done simultaneously in all the five (5) selected transects using the recruited field assistances. The individuals started at one end of transects and walk at a reasonable speed of 1km/hr following the guides of Hacher, (2003).

Phase 3: Second census (Evening 3:00pm -6:00pm) daily. The process was repeated each month for twelve (12) months. This was done to enable comparison of the primates population densities of the two censured areas.

Each transect was covered by an observer and the census was done simultaneously in all the five (5) selected transects. The observers were linked by means of an electronic stop watch which each possessed and this was done to reduce the incidence of double counting of primates. Fifteen field assistance were recruited, made up of 10 field Technologists, 3 Students and two Secondary School teachers. During the field census, the observers were equipped with binoculars, digital cameras, and a field data sheet to record the following informations.

1. Transect numbers 2. Right angle distance (to the path of observation) walked by observer 3. Distance of observer to animals, sighted 4. Number of animals sighted.

From the above information, the population density of primates was determined according to (Ogar (2009) 


## METHODS FOR SAMPLING PLANTS POPULATIONS IN THE RESERVES:

The Total Enumeration count Method (T.E.C) was used for the vegetation sampling data collection during the population estimate. This method was also used by Wirkikfea et al (2008) in Okomu National Park. The method involves the total enumeration of all trees plants above one meter height, and diameter of not less than 10cm,( from 25 x 25m2). Four (4) out of the 16 quadrants were randomly selected through balloting in each of the five sampling transect giving a total of twenty (20) plots dimension of 25 x 25m2 .

The following data were collected within each sampling quadrant: total counting of all tree plants above 1m height and diameter = 10; total enumeration of all the tree plant species and family to which they belong; the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all the tree plants above 1m height, i.e ( ≥ 10cm).

The data obtained were analysed as follows;

Plant Density (Per hectare) = Total number of trees counted x 1ha

Total Area Sampled

The Basal Area (BA) for each tree was calculated using the expression: Purposive sampling method as also described by Emaikwu (2011) was used to select surrounding communities. In this method, the surrounding communities were group into two strata of A and B. A for those communities very closed to the Forest Reserve and B for those communities reasonably distanced away from the Forest Reserve.
BA = )( D2
Four communities were purposively selected, Oyinyi (0.2km) and Andioilla (1 ½ km) from the forest reserve. The purposive sampling method as described also by Emaikwu (2011) was used to distribute the eighty (80) close ended questionaire to hunters, loggers, farmers and elderly persons in those communities because of their experience. Focus group discussion (FGD) as well as in-depth interview (IDI) were requested from community leaders.

Descriptive statistic tools such as bar-charts, pie-charts and pictograms were used to analyse the data on: Anthropogenic activities and demographic socia-economic assessment of the surrounding communities of the Reserves.

The students T-test (Test of independent means) was used to compare the result obtained from the two censured areas of primates population densities using the following hypothesis.

H0: There is no significance difference in the mean densities of primates in the two censured areas.

H1: There is significant difference in the means densities of primates in the two censured areas.

The test criterion is given as; t= 1x1 -x2 1 x1=means density of first census.

x2= means density of second census sp= pooled variance The data analysed were presented in tables, charts and figures From the results it was observed that no variations of species diversity exist between the two Forest Reserves. It also observed that there is no significant difference at 5% level of significance. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index usually varies from 1.5 to 3.5 and rarely exceeds 4.5 (Kent & Coker 1992 in Yaaiwa Forest Reserve. This suggests that both Yaaiwa and Ipinu-igede forest reserves had considerably species . rainy/wet season had more number of primates species sighted probably due to availability of eatable fruits.The florishing vegetation acted as protection and gave shades to these animals.  (136) in dry season and one hundred and one (101) in the rainy/wet season. This was followed by olive Baboon (Papio anubis) with seventy one (71) in dry season and fifty six (56) in the wet/rainy season. Tantalus monkey (chlorocebus aethiops) had the least number of forty six (46) in dry season and twenty nine (29) in rainy/wet season  Source: Field survey, (2018).


## Figure7,indicated the monthly trend of primates by season in both Yaaiwa and ipinu-igede Forest

Reserves. Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas) had the highest number of sightings, followed by Olive baboon (Papio anubis). Tantalus monkey (chlorocebus aethiops) has the least number. The species were sighted more during the wet season between June to September (2018). The population dropped drastically from October (2018) to January (2019) and raised a little from February to April, (2019). This could be as a result of their edible fruits availability in the wet season than in the dry season. As shown in figure 8 above, three indirect indices calls, Dungs and foot prints of primates were encountered in the study areas. Calls were encountered more in both Forest Reserves, followed by foot prints. Dungs had the least encounter rate in the two Forest Reserves. From table 5, the result showed that twenty three (23) different species of trees were encountered in the sampled area of Yaaiwa Forest Reserve. A total of five hundred and fifty nine (559) trees were counted and the area sampled was 12.5 hectaresas as forty five (45) trees were counted per hectare. With Shannon-weiner diversity index of 2.43.Shannon-Weiner diversity index usually varies from 1.5 to 3.5 and rarely exceeds 4.5 (Kent & Coker 1992 (447), total area sampled was 12.5 hectares and the number of trees per hectare was 36/ha. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index usually varies from 1.5 to 3.5 and rarely exceeds 4.5 (Kent & Coker 1992    Source: Field survey, (2018).

From table 8 above, of the eighty (80) respondents, seven (7) (8.8%) of them were observed to had participated in hunting in Ipinu-igede Forest Reserve. However one (1) (1.3%) of them have being hunting over a period of 1-5 years, two (2) (2.5%) agreed to had being hunting over 6-10 years, two (2) (2.5%) also agreed to had being hunting over a period of 11-15 years and two (2) (2.5%) have being hunting over a period of 20 years and above.

Two (2) (2.5%) of these hunters indicated that they used wire-snares in hunting. Three (3) (3.8%) of them agreed to have used Dane gun, another three (3) (3.8%) indicated to had used shot gun. Seven of them indicated to have encountered some primates' species during hunting. Of the seven (7), One (1) (1.3%) respondent agreed to have encountered Olive baboon (Papio anubis). One (1) (1.3%) was observed to had encountered Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas) and five (5) (6.3%) indicated to have encountered Tantalus monkey (chlorocebus aethiops). they were all of the view that the population of primates in these Forest Reserves were decreasing.

Their awareness on the law prohibiting the killing of primates' species in and around these Reserves showed that, only seven (7) (8.8%) respondents were aware of the law. All the seven (7) (8.8%) respondents got their source of awareness via Radio. Whereas seventy three (73) (91.2%) were observed not to be aware of the law prohibiting the killing of primates.  (80), only seven (7) (8.8%) agreed to had participated in logging and it was observed they have been logging over a period of 1-5 years. They also indicated that during their logging activities the encountered two different species of primates. Four (4) (5%) were observed to had encountered Olive baboon and three (3) (3.8%) agreed to had encountered Tantalus monkey. They also accepted the fact that the population of primate species in and around these Reserves had decrease totally. Concerning their awareness on the law prohibiting logging in and around these Forest Reserves, only seven (7) (8.8%) of them agreed to be aware of this laws and their source of awareness was Radio. Seventy three (73) (91.2%) of them indicated that they were not aware of the law prohibiting logging in these Reserves.  


## DISCUSSION


## Assessment of Anthropogenic Activities Occurring In Yaaiwa and Ipinu-Igede Forest

Reserves.

The anthropogenic activities observed during this study were: hunting, logging and farming which are in accordance with those observed by Oladeji et.al, (2010), in Old Oyo National Park that included Hunting, logging, Grazing, Fishing, Honey Harvesting, Farming, and exploitation of Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs).


## Level of Hunting, logging and farming in the Study Area.

As indicated in table 10, the level of hunting pressure in the study areas was assessed. Eighty (80) respondents submitted their reports and only seven (7) (8.8%) from Ipinu-igede were observed to be hunters. This level of hunters is, however lower than that observed by Ajayi et al, (2012) in Okomu National Park where (10%) of hu nters were found to have poached int


## Level of logging in the Study Areas

From table 10, seven (7) (8.8%) respondents were observed to had encroached in Yaaiwa Forest Reserve. This level of loggers encroachment is however, lower than that observed by Ajayi et al (2012) in Okomu National Park where (10%) of loggers were found to have encroached into the Park. This could also be as a result of traditional laws enacted by the traditional rulers in these Forest Reserves. Believing that anyone who cut down a tree in the Reserves will die.


## Level of farming in the Study Areas

As indicated in table 10 also, the level of farming in the study areas were very high (100%). This high rate could be as a result of high level of pressure on the Forests as majority of the people living around the study areas were farmers.

This agreed with Mittermeier et al., (2009)  Awareness on the prohibition of logging, hunting and farming in the study areas (Yaaiwa and Ipinu-Igede Forest Reserves)

From table 8-10, only 22 (27.6%) admitted to be aware of the law prohibiting hunting, logging and farming in the Forest Reserves, whereas 58 (72.5%) admitted that they were not aware of these anti conservation practices.

The implication here is that efforts should be intensified through workshops and more people (Stakeholders should be involved) more in conservation programs and jingles should be aired on the radio promoting wholesome conservation practices.The lack of awareness here could be as a result of not showing concern over conserved areas. This is because the 22 respondents that admitted to be aware of the law prohibiting hunting, logging and farming in these Reserves got their source of awareness through one channel (Radio).

This low level of awareness did not agree with the observation of Edet et al, (2006), who observed high level of awareness among the respondents in the enclaves of the Cross River National Park.


## Diversity and abundance of primate's species sighted in the study areas.

Species diversity, to which species richness and evenness contribute to a varying degree, is the subject matter of biodiversity and conservation biology because it acts as an indicator in most ecological studies.

The Shannon-Weiner diversity index usually varies from 1.5 to 3.5 and rarely exceeds 4.5 (Kent & Coker 1992). A low H value generally suggests a site with few species and a few dominant species, while a high H value suggests considerably presence of species.

From table 10, the result showed that out of the twelve (12) months of survey in Yaaiwa and Ipinu-igede Forest Reserves a total of one hundred and forty nine (149) primate's species were sighted in Ipinu-igede Forest Reserve, whereas one hundred and five were observed in Yaaiwa Forest Reserve. Also, it was observed that no major variations of species diversity exist between the two Forest Reserves. It was also observed that there was no significant difference at 5% level of significance between Yaaiwa and Ipinu-Igede Forset Reserves. This study observed a high Shannon-Weiner diversity index of 3.51 in Ipinu-igede Forest Reserve and 3.29 in Yaaiwa Forest Reserve suggesting that both Yaaiwa and Ipinu-igede Forest Reserves had considerably more dominant species but no diversity as eveness equal 0.99 and 0.96 respectively.


## Primate species availability and distribution in the study areas

The result obtained in the two Forest Reserves as shown in table 9&10, for a period of twelve (12) months of survey, only three (3) species of primates were sighted in Yaaiwa and Ipinu-Igede Forest Reserves. Among the three (3) species Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas) has the highest number of One hundred and thirty seven with thirty six (36) in dry season and one hundred and one (101) in rainy/wet season.

For the wet/rainy season, this may be as a result of fruits and water available in the season which 
triggers the animals to come out of their hide. Species Dominance ranges from 0.05 in dry season 
to 0.03 in rainy/wet season. Simpson index falls between 0.95 in dry season to 0.97 in wet 
season. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index usually varies from 3.03 in dry season to 3.61 in the 
rainy/wet season. The degree of Evenness was 0.99 in dry season and 0.96 in the wet season. 
Margalef species richness varies from 4.74 in dry season to 7.85 in the rainy/wet season. Fisher

108%) were observed to have being farming over a period of 16-20 years. Fifty eight (58) (72.5%) were observed to have being farming over a period of twenty years. Above all, the respondents indicated that they have being practicing shifting cultivation system of farming. And during their farming periods they encountered three species of primates Olive baboon, Patas monkey and Tantalus monkey. Twenty three (23) (28.7%) of them agreed to have encountered Olive baboon, Forty nine (49) (61.3%) were observed to have encountered Patas monkey, eight (8) (10%) of them agreed to have encountered Tantalus monkey during farming. One hundred per cent (100%) of the respondents in both Forest Reserves indicated that the population of primates have decreased drastically over the past ten years. Seventy two (72) (90%) of these respondents, were not aware of the law prohibiting farming in these Reserves. Only eight (8) (10%) were observed to be aware of the law and their source of awareness was through Radio.showed that eighty (80) respondents were administered with questionnaire in Yaaiwa 
and Ipinu-igede Forest Reserves and all the eighty (80) (100%) respondents were observed to be 
farmers. Two (2) (2.5%) were observed to have being farming over a period of 6-10 years. one
