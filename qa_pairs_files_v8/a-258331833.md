## (s3) BERT-style Language Models: Encoder-Decoder or Encoder-only
### Question: What motivates unsupervised learning of natural language and how do Masked Language Models work?

(p3.0) As natural language data is readily available and unsupervised training paradigms have been proposed to better utilize extremely large datasets, this motivates the unsupervised learning of natural language. One common approach is to predict masked words in a sentence while considering the surrounding context. This training paradigm is known as the Masked Language Model. This type of training allows the model to develop a deeper understanding of the relationships between words and the context in which they are used. These models are trained on a large corpus of texts using techniques such as the Transformer architecture and have achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. Notable examples of Masked Language Models include BERT [28], RoBERTa [65], and T5 [84]. MLMs have become an important tool in the field of natural language processing due to their success in a wide range of tasks.

## (s4) GPT-style Language Models: Decoder-only
### Question: How do autoregressive language models enhance few-shot and zero-shot learning performance?

(p4.0) Although language models are typically task-agnostic in architecture, these methods require fine-tuning on datasets of the specific downstream task. Researchers found that scaling up language models significantly improves the few-shot, even zero-shot performance [16]. The most successful models for better few-shot and zero-show performance are Autoregressive Language Models, which are trained by generating the next word in a sequence given the preceding words. These models have been widely used for downstream tasks such as text generation and question answering.

### Question: What are examples and advancements in autoregressive language models?

(p4.1) Examples of Autoregressive Language Models include GPT-3 [16], OPT [126], PaLM [22], and BLOOM [92]. The game changer, GPT-3, for the first time, demonstrated reasonable few-/zero-shot performance via prompting and in-context learning, thus showing the superiority of autoregressive language models. There are also models such as CodeX [2] that are optimized for specific tasks such as code generation, BloombergGPT [117] for the financial domain. The recent breakthrough is ChatGPT, which refines GPT-3 specifically for conversational tasks, resulting in more interactive, coherent, and context-aware conversational for various real-world applications.

## (s7) Pretraining data
### Question: How does pre-training data influence large language model performance and capabilities?

(p7.0) Pre-training data plays a pivotal role in the development of large language models. As the foundation of remarkable capabilities [5,47] of LLMs, the quality, quantitative, and diversity of pre-training data influence the performance of LLMs significantly [124]. The commonly used pretraining data consists of a myriad of text sources, including books, articles, and websites. The data is carefully curated to ensure a comprehensive representation of human knowledge, linguistic nuances, and cultural perspectives. The importance of pretraining data lies in its capacity to inform the language model with a rich understanding of word knowledge, grammar, syntax, and semantics, as well as the ability to recognize context and generate coherent responses. The diversity of pretraining data also plays a crucial role in shaping the model's performance, and the selection of LLMs highly depends on the components of the pretraining data. For example, PaLM [22] and BLOOM [92] excel in multilingual tasks and machine translation with an abundance of multilingual pretraining data. Moreover, PaLM's performance in Question Answering tasks is enhanced by incorporating a considerable amount of social media conversations and Books corpus [22]. Likewise, code execution and code completion capabilities of GPT-3.5 (code-davinci-002) are amplified by the integration of code data in its pretraining dataset. In brief, when selecting LLMs for downstream tasks, it is advisable to choose the model pre-trained on a similar field of data.

## (s8) Finetuning data
### Question: What models are best for zero, few, and abundant annotated data scenarios?

(p8.0) When deploying a model for downstream tasks, it is essential to consider three primary scenarios based on the availability of annotated data: zero, few, and abundant. In this section, we provide a succinct overview of the appropriate models to employ for each scenario. Zero annotated data: In scenarios where annotated data is unavailable, utilizing LLMs in a zero-shot setting proves to be the most suitable approach. LLMs have been shown to outperform previous zero-shot methods [120]. Additionally, the absence of a parameter update process ensures that catastrophic forgetting [49] is avoided since the language model parameters remain unaltered.

## (s9) Test data/user data
### Question: What challenges do LLMs face when applied to real-world downstream tasks?

(p9.0) When deploying LLMs for downstream tasks, we often face challenges stemming from distributional differences between the test/user data and that of the training data. These disparities may encompass domain shifts [132], out-of-distribution variations [31], or even adversarial examples [82]. Such challenges significantly hinder fine-tuned modes' effectiveness in real-world applications. They fit into a specific distribution and have a poor ability to generalize to OOD data.

## (s13) No use case.
### Question: What is the effectiveness of different models in detecting online toxicity, including CivilComments and Perspective API 3?

(p13.2) CivilComments [13] even the best one is only better than random guessing [59]. On the other hand, most popular fine-tuned models can obtain much better performance [33]. and the Perspective API 3 is still one of the best for detecting toxicity. This API is powered by a multilingual BERT-based model, which is tuned on publicly available toxicity data and several smaller single-language CNNs distilled from this model. This might be due to the fact that toxicity is defined by subtle nuances in linguistic expressions, and large language models are unable to accurately comprehend this task solely based on the provided input.

### Question: Why are LLMs not widely used in information retrieval tasks?

(p13.4) In information retrieval (IR) tasks, LLMs are not widely exploited yet. One major reason is that IR tasks are fundamentally different from others. There's no natural way to transform the thousands of candidate texts into a few/zero-shot form which is required by LLMs. The existing evaluation results on MS MARCO(regular/TREC) [73] show that methods based on fine-tuned models have better performance [59]. In this evaluation, the LLMs rank passages in an unorthodox way, which requires the LLMs to produce probabilities for passages one by one.

### Question: What are the challenges and insights in adapting language models to NLP tasks?

(p13.8) Transforming input from tasks like IR and sentence labeling into a few/zero-short instruction form is non-trivial. There may be better ways to adapt language models to traditional NLP tasks in the future. On the other hand, the upper limit of capabilities of fine-tuned models is not reached, and some methods like FLAN-tuning [67] can further boost the performance on NLU tasks. Another interesting finding is that on NLU tasks, after fine-tuning, masked language models, like T5 [85], are better than most auto-regressive language models at the same scale, while some recent results imply that this gap can be bridged by scaling [22].

### Question: What are examples of tasks showing LLMs' superior generalization in NLP?

(p13.10) One of the representative tasks is miscellaneous text classification [59]. In contrast to classic domain-specific text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, miscellaneous text classification deals with a diverse range of topics and categories that may not have a clear or strong relationship with one another. It's closer to real-world cases and hard to be formatted for using fine-tuned models. Another is the Adversarial NLI (ANLI) [74]. It is a difficult dataset composed of adversarially mined natural language inference questions in three rounds (R1, R2, and R3). LLMs have shown superior performance on ANLI, especially on the R3 and R2. Both examples demonstrate the exceptional ability of LLMs to generalize well on out-of-distribution and sparsely annotated data in traditional NLP tasks, surpassing that of fine-tuned models. We've discussed this in the section above 3.3.

## (s15) Remark 3
### Question: How do LLMs compare in machine translation performance to commercial tools and in low-resource languages?

(p15.4) In machine translation (MT), LLMs can perform competent translation, although the average performance is slightly worse than some commercial translation tools [45] considering some automatic metrics like BLEU [78]. LLMs are particularly good at translating some low-resource language texts to English texts, such as in the Romanian-English translation of WMT'16 [11], zero-shot or few-shot LLMs can perform better than SOTA fine-tuned model [22]. This is mainly due to the fact that English resources compose the main part of the pre-training data. BLOOM [92] is pre-trained on more multi-lingual data, leading to better translation quality in both rich-resource and low-resource translation.

### Question: What are the capabilities of LLMs in generating content and coding?

(p15.6) Additionally, LLMs are highly skilled in open-ended generations. One example is that the news articles generated by LLMs are almost indistinguishable from real news articles by humans [16]. LLMs are remarkably adept at code synthesis as well. Either for text-code generation, such as HumanEval [18] and MBPP [7], or for code repairing, such as DeepFix [39], LLMs can perform pretty well. GPT-4 can even pass 25% problems in Leetcode, which are not trivial for most human coders [76]. With training on more code data, the coding capability of LLMs can be improved further [22].

## (s18) Remark 4
### Question: What makes LLMs excel in closed-book question-answering tasks across various datasets?

(p18.3) Closed-book question-answering tasks require the model to answer a given question about factual knowledge without any external information. It does require the memorization of real-world knowledge in the model. LLMs perform better on nearly all datasets, such as on NaturalQuestions [52], WebQuestions [9], and TriviaQA [46]. On TriviaQA, even zero-shot LLMs is still much better [22].

### Question: Why is machine reading comprehension considered a knowledge-intensive but manageable task for MMLU?

(p18.4) The massive multitask language understanding (MMLU) [40] is also highly knowledge-intensive. Some tasks only require the model to capture the self-contained knowledge in the contexts. The knowledge in the contexts from the input is enough for the model to make predictions. For these tasks, small fine-tuned models can work pretty well. One such task is machine reading comprehension (MRC). An MRC task provides several paragraphs and requires the model to predict the answer to questions based on these paragraphs. We've discussed MRC in the previous section because it's also a traditional NLU task.

## (s19) Abilities Regarding Scaling
### Question: How does scaling impact the capabilities and performance of large language models?

(p19.0) Scaling of LLMs (e.g. parameters, training computation, etc.) can greatly empower pretrained language models. With the model scaling up, a model generally becomes more capable in a range of tasks. Reflected in some metrics, the performance shows a power-law relationship with the model scale. For example, the cross-entropy loss which is used to measure the performance for language modeling decreases linearly with the exponential increase in the model scale, which is also called 'scaling-law' [41,47]. For some crucial abilities, such as reasoning, scaling the model has gradually transformed these abilities from a very low state to a usable state, and even approaching human capabilities. In this section, we provide an overview of the usage of LLMs in terms of the abilities and behaviors of LLMs along with scaling.

## (s22) Use Cases with Emergent Abilities.
### Question: What are emergent abilities in large-scale models, and why are they significant?

(p22.0) Scaling of models also endows the model with some unprecedented, fantastic abilities that go beyond the power-law rule. These abilities are called "emergent ability". As defined in [113], emergent abilities of LLMs are abilities that are not present in smaller-scale models but are present in large-scale models. This means such abilities cannot be predicted by extrapolating the performance improvements on smaller-scale models and the model suddenly gains good performance on some tasks once the scale exceeds a certain range. The emergent ability is typically unpredictable and surprising, leading to tasks that emerge randomly or unexpectedly. We examine concrete examples of the emergent abilities of LLMs and provide them as an important reference for deciding whether to leverage LLMs' emergent abilities.

### Question: What emergent abilities do large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM exhibit?

(p22.2) For example. GPT-3 [16] shows the emergent ability for word sorting, and word unscrambling tasks. PaLM [22] exhibits the emergent ability on ASCII word recognition 4 and hyperbaton 5 task. The logical abilities of language models tend to emerge as the model scales up, such as logical deduction, logical sequence, and logic grid puzzles. Additionally, other tasks, such as advanced coding (e.g., auto debugging, code line description), and concept understanding (e.g., novel concepts, simple Turing concepts), are also use cases with the emergent abilities of large language models.

## (s23) No-Use Cases and Understanding.
### Question: What explains the behavior of large language models scaling, including emergent abilities and U-shape phenomenon?

(p23.3) Gaining a deeper understanding of emergent abilities, inverse scaling phenomenon and U-shape phenomenon in LLMs is essential for advancing research in this field. In a certain sense, the U-shape phenomenon suggests that small-scale models and huge-scale models make predictions with different internal mechanisms. From this perspective, the U-shape phenomenon can be seen as a transformation of the inverse-scaling phenomenon due to some emergent abilities from sufficiently large models [114]. GPT-4 [76] exhibits a reversal of the inverse scaling phenomenon in some cases, such as on a task called Hindsight Neglect. The explanation for these behaviors of LLMs during scaling is still an open problem. Several hypotheses have been proposed. For emergent abilities, one explanation is that there may be multiple key steps for a task and the LLM cannot handle this task until it's large enough to handle every step, and another explanation is focused on the granularity of evaluation metrics [113]. For inverse-scaling phenomenon and u-shape phenomenon, the explanations mainly focus on the model's over-reliance on information from its prior rather than the input prompts, valid but misleading few-shot examples, and distracting easier tasks within a hard task [114].

## (s26) No use case.
### Question: Why do LLMs underperform in regression and multimodal tasks despite their NLP success?

(p26.1) Although LLMs have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, their performance in regression tasks has been less impressive. For example, ChatGPT's performance on the GLUE STS-B dataset, which is a regression task evaluating sentence similarity, is inferior to a fine-tuned RoBERTa performance [130]. The Regression tasks typically involve predicting a continuous value rather than a discrete label, posing unique challenges for LLMs. One primary reason for their subpar performance is the inherent difference between the language modeling objective and the regression task objective. LLMs are designed to predict the next word in a sequence or generate coherent text, with their pre-training focused on capturing linguistic patterns and relationships. Consequently, their internal representations may not be well-suited for modeling continuous numerical outputs. Besides, LLMs have predominantly been trained on text data, focusing on capturing the intricacies of natural language processing. As a result, their performance on multimodal data, which involves handling multiple data types such as text, images, audio, video, actions, and robotics, remains largely unexplored. And fine-tuned multimodal models, like BEiT [110] and PaLI [19], still dominate many tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning. Nonetheless, the recently introduced GPT-4 [76] has taken the step in multimodal fusion, but there is still a lack of detailed evaluation of its capabilities.

## (s27) Use case.
### Question: How do LLMs perform in NLG task quality assessment compared to traditional metrics?

(p27.3) LLMs can also be used for quality assessment on some NLG tasks, such as summarization and translation. On summarization tasks, GPT-4 as an evaluator achieves a higher correlation with humans than other methods with a large margin [64]. Some other evaluators based on LLMs [34,50,64,108] also show good human alignment in more NLG tasks, especially compared with traditional automatic metrics. But the LLM evaluator may have a bias towards the LLM-generated texts [64].

## (s29) Remark 7
### Question: What methods enhance LLMs' abilities to understand instructions and generate better responses?

(p29.2) Additionally, some mechanics such as instruction tuning [91,112] and human alignment tuning [77] further boost the capabilities of LLMs to better comprehend and follow user instructions. These methods improve the model's ability to generate helpful, harmless, and honest responses while maintaining coherence and consistency [77,91,112]. While both methods can make LLMs better generalize to unseen tasks and instructions, it has been noticed that while human labelers prefer models tuned for human alignment [77] to models tuned with instructions from public NLP tasks, such as FLAN [112] and T0 [91]. The reason may be similar to reasons for fine-tuned models' inferiority: public NLP tasks/datasets are designed for easy and automatic evaluation, and they can only cover a small part of real-world usage.

## (s32) Efficiency
### Question: What are the computational and financial costs of large model training and using OpenAI's API?

(p32.2) Flops, while a T5 11B model only requires 3.30 × 10 22 , which is 10 times less. In addition to these costs, hardware requirements are also substantial. OpenAI has collaborated with Microsoft on a supercomputer hosted in the Microsoft Azure cloud, consisting of 285k CPU cores and 10k high-end GPUs to support the training of large models. For users of the OpenAI API, pricing varies based on the model and usage, with options such as GPT-3.5-turbo charging $0.002 per 1k tokens for chat service. However, for users who require custom models, training costs $0.03 per 1k tokens, while usage costs $0.12 per 1k tokens [4]. Therefore, for users who cannot afford such a large cost, such as small startups, individual users, etc., a small, fine-tuned model is a better and more reasonable choice.

### Question: What is Parameter-Efficient Tuning and its common techniques in model optimization?

(p32.4) Parameter-Efficient Tuning. In practice, we may tune the model on some specific datasets. Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PET) is an efficient technique to tune a small portation of model parameters (or extra parameters) while freezing most parameters of the pre-trained LLMs. The main goal of PEFT is to greatly decrease the computational and storage costs while keeping the performance of the original models. The common techniques for PET are LoRA [42], Prefix Tuning [58], P-Tuning [62,63]. As an illustration, the LoRA method maintains the weights of the pre-trained model and incorporates low-rank matrices into every layer of the Transformer architecture. This approach considerably minimizes the number of parameters that require training for subsequent tasks, thereby increasing overall efficiency.

## (s33) Trustworthiness
### Question: What affects the robustness and calibration of fine-tuned models, and how can these be enhanced?

(p33.2) The models that have high accuracy on the scenario also have good robustness. However, the robustness of the zero-shot becomes worse after being tuned on extra application-specific tasks data [116]. This may due to overfitting, which leads to poor generalizability due to the extremely high complexity of the model and the limited training samples from downstream tasks [43]. In a similar vein, it has been observed that fine-tuning a model can result in significant miscalibrations, owing to over-parameterization [51]. Therefore, fine-tuned models may not be an optimal choice when robustness and calibration are critical considerations. However, human alignment has been found as a potential solution for enhancing model robustness. InstructGPT davinci v2 (175B*) has been shown to outperform other models in terms of robustness. On the other hand, achieving optimal calibration of the model depends on the scenario and adaptation procedure employed.

### Question: What challenges do LLMs face in terms of fairness and bias, and how can they be addressed?

(p33.3) Fairness and Bias. LLMs have been shown to exhibit disparate treatment and impact, perpetuating societal biases and potentially leading to discrimination [10,17]. To ensure fairness and equity for all users, it is crucial to address these issues in the development and deployment of NLP models. Disparities in performance between demographic groups can serve as an indicator of fairness problems. LLMs are particularly susceptible to fairness issues, as significant performance disparities have been observed across demographic categories such as dialect, religion, gender, and race [59]. However, research has shown that aligning models with human instructions can improve LLM performance regardless of their size, with the InstructGPTmodel (davinci v2) exhibiting smaller performance disparities than other LLMs [23].

### Question: How do LLMs compare to fine-tuned models in managing shortcut learning in NLU tasks?

(p33.4) Spurious Biases. The shortcut learning problem has been observed in various natural language understanding tasks under the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm, where models heavily rely on spurious correlations between input and labels in the fine-tuning data for prediction [31,35,98]. For example, in reading comprehension tasks, fine-tuned models tend to focus on the lexical matching of words between the question and the original passage, neglecting the intended reading comprehension task itself [53]. In contrast, large language models are not directly trained on fine-tuned datasets, which makes it less likely for them to learn shortcut features present in the fine-tuned dataset, thereby enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. However, LLMs are not infallible and may exhibit some shortcut learning during in-context learning. For example, recent preliminary studies have begun investigating the robustness of prompt-based methods in large-scale language models [111,129]. One such study evaluates the few-shot learning performance of GPT-3 on text classification and information extraction tasks [129]. and reveal that the examined LLMs are susceptible to majority label bias and position bias, where they tend to predict answers based on the frequency or position of the answers in the training data. Moreover, these LLMs exhibit common token bias, favoring answers that are prevalent in their pre-training corpus. Recent studies show that this positional bias can be mitigated by selecting proper prompts [68]. In summary, while LLMs significantly reduce the shortcut learning problem prevalent in fine-tuned models, they still exhibit some shortcut learning issues and should be approached with caution when deploying them in downstream applications.

## (s34) Safety challenges
### Question: What are the risks and necessary safeguards associated with using Large Language Models (LLMs)?

(p34.3) Harmful content. Due to the high coherence, quality, and plausibility of texts generated by LLMs, harmful contents from LLMs can cause significant harm, including hate speech, discrimination, incitement to violence, false narratives, and even social engineering attack. The implementation of safeguards to detect and correct those contents can be mitigation [97]. These LLMs can also have dual-use potential by providing required illicit information, leading to risks such as the proliferation of weapons [75] and even terrorism attack planning. It is crucial to ensure using these LLMs responsibly, with safeguards in place to prevent harm. Also, in existing work, feedback from humans plays an important role in getting rid of harmful outputs.

### Question: What privacy issues have LLMs faced, illustrated by Samsung and OpenAI incidents?

(p34.4) Privacy. LLMs can face serious security issues. An example is the issue of user privacy. It is reported that Samsung employees were using ChatGPT to process their work when they inadvertently leaked top-secret data, including the source code proper of the new program, internal meeting minutes related to the hardware, etc. The Italian data protection agency declared that OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, illicitly gathered personal user data, leading Italy to become the first government to prohibit ChatGPT over privacy concerns [1].
