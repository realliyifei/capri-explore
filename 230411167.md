## Introduction

A pH of chemical indicator is a halochromic compound added in small amounts to a solution so the pH (acidity or basicity) of the solution can be determined visually. Hence, a pH indicator is a chemical detector for (H 3 O + ) hydronium ions or hydrogen ions (H + ) . Generally, the indicator appear color of the solution to change depending on the pH. Indicators can give change in many chemical and physical properties of solution ; for example, olfactory indicators show change in their odor. The pH value of a neutral solution is 7.0 at 25°C (standard laboratory conditions). Solutions have a pH value less than 7.0 are considered acidic and solutions have pH value more than 7.0 are basic -alkaline. As most naturally occurring organic compounds are weak protolytes, carboxylic acids and amines, pH indicators find many applications in biology and analytical chemistry. Moreover, pH indicators form one of the three main types of indicator compounds used in chemical analysis. For the quantitative analysis of metal cations, the use of complex metric indicators is preferred, whereas the third compound class, the redox indicators, are used in titrations involving a redox reaction as the basis of the analysis. Chemical Indicator is substance whose solutions change color due to changes in pH. These are called acid-base indicators. They are usually weak acids or bases, but their conjugate base or acid forms have different colors due to differences in their absorption spectra www.acseusa.org/journal/index.php/aijser American International Journal of Sciences and Engineering Research Vol. 2, No. 1; 2 Types of indicators : there are many types


## 1-Acid -Base Indicators in Titrations

Acid -Base indicators are chemical substances that change color with pH. They are weak acids or bases, when dissolved in water dissociate slightly and form ions. Consider an indicator which is a weak acid, with the formula HIn. At equilibrium, the following equilibrium equation is established with its conjugate base:

The acid and its conjugate base have different colors. At low pH values the concentration of H 3 O + is high and so the equilibrium position lies to the left. The equilibrium solution has the color A. At high pH values, the concentration of H 3 O + is low -the equilibrium position thus lies to the right and the equilibrium solution has color B.

Phenolphthalein is an example of an indicator which establishes this type of equilibrium in aqueous solution:

Phenolphthalein is a colorless, weak acid which dissociates in water forming pink anions. Under acidic conditions, the equilibrium is to the left, and the concentration of the anions is too low for the pink color to be observed. However, under alkaline conditions, the equilibrium is to the right, and the concentration of the anion becomes sufficient for the pink color to be observed.


## 2-pH Test papers

Litmus paper is the most familiar pH paper. It is used to broadly test whether a solution is acidic or basic and appear in 3 types-red, blue, and neutral. Red litmus turns blue in basic solutions, blue litmus turns red in acidic solution, and neutral litmus (usually purple) turns red in acidic solutions and blue in basic solutions. To find the specific pH of a sample, you will need a pH test paper or strip that is more precise than a litmus strip.

The pH of the solution at its turning point is called the pK ln and is the pH at which half of the indicator is in its acid form and the other half in the form of its conjugate base.


## 3-pH meters

The most precise of the 3 test types , pH meters measure a solution's pH through measuring the electrical potential difference with the pH electrode and a reference electrode. The meter then coverts this potential to a pH reading. They offer readings to 0.01 pH unit, and are useful for advanced science, college, or research work that requires this level of precision.

The Range of Indicator: At a low pH, a weak acid indicator is almost entirely in the HIn form, the color of which predominates. As the pH increases -the intensity of the color of HIn decreases and the equilibrium is pushed to the right. Therefore the intensity of the color of Inincreases. An indicator is most effective if the color change is distinct and over a low pH range. For most indicators the range is within ±1 of the pK ln value: Precipitation is the creation of a solid from a solution. When the reaction occurs in a liquid solution, the solid formed is called the 'precipitate'. The chemical that causes the solid to form is called the 'precipitant'. Without sufficient force of gravity (settling) to bring the solid particles together, the precipitate remains in suspension. After sedimentation, especially when using a centrifuge to press it into a compact mass, the precipitate may be referred to as a 'pellet'. Precipitation can be used as a medium. The precipitate-free liquid remaining above the solid is called the 'supernate' or 'supernatant'. Powders derived from precipitation have also historically been known as 'flowers'. When the solid appears in the form of cellulose fibers which have been through chemical processing, the process is often referred to as regeneration.

Sometimes the formation of a precipitate indicates the occurrence of a chemical reaction. If silver nitrate solution is poured into a solution of sodium chloride, a chemical reaction occurs forming a white precipitate of silver chloride. When potassium iodide solution reacts with lead(II) nitrate solution, a yellow precipitate of lead(II) iodide is formed.

Precipitation may occur if the concentration of a compound exceeds its solubility (such as when mixing solvents or changing their temperature). Precipitation may occur rapidly from a supersaturated solution.

In solids, precipitation occurs if the concentration of one solid is above the solubility limit in the host solid, due to e.g. rapid quenching or ion implantation, and the temperature is high enough that diffusion can lead to segregation into precipitates. Precipitation in solids is routinely used to synthesize nanoclusters.

An important stage of the precipitation process is the onset of nucleation. The creation of a hypothetical solid particle includes the formation of an interface, which requires some energy based on the relative surface energy of the solid and the solution. If this energy is not available, and no suitable nucleation surface is available, super saturation occurs.

Precipitation reactions can be used for making pigments, removing salts from water in water treatment, and in classical qualitative inorganic analysis.

Precipitation is also useful to isolate the products of a reaction during workup. Ideally, the product of the reaction is insoluble in the reaction solvent. Thus, it precipitates as it is formed, preferably forming pure crystals. An example of this would be the synthesis of porphyrins in refluxing propionic acid. By cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, crystals of the porphyrin precipitate, and are collected by filtration:

In chemistry, coprecipitation (CPT) or co-precipitation is the carrying down by a precipitate of substances normally soluble under the conditions employed. Analogously, in medicine, coprecipitation is specifically the precipitation of an unbound "antigen along with an antigen-antibody complex".

Coprecipitation process is an important issue in chemical analysis, where it is often undesirable, but in some cases it can be exploited. In gravimetric analysis, which consists on precipitating the sample and measuring its mass to determine its concentration or purity, coprecipitation is a problem because undesired impurities often coprecipitate with the analyte, resulting in excess mass. This problem can often be mitigated by "digestion" (waiting for the precipitate to equilibrate and form larger, purer particles) or by redissolving the sample and precipitating it again.

On the other hand, in the analysis of trace elements, as is often the case in radiochemistry, coprecipitation is often the only way of separating an element. Since the trace element is too dilute (sometimes less than a part per trillion) to precipitate by conventional means, it is typically coprecipitated with a carrier, a substance that has a similar crystalline structure that can incorporate the desired element. An example is the separation of francium from other radioactive elements by coprecipitating it with caesium salts such as caesium perchlorate. Otto Hahn is credited for promoting the use of coprecipitation in radiochemistry.

There are three main mechanisms of coprecipitation: inclusion, occlusion, and adsorption. [3] An inclusion occurs when the impurity occupies a lattice site in the crystal structure of the carrier, resulting in a crystallographic defect; this can happen when the ionic radius and charge of the impurity are similar to those of the carrier. An adsorbate is an impurity that is weakly bound (adsorbed) to the surface of the precipitate. An occlusion occurs when an adsorbed impurity gets physically trapped inside the crystal as it grows.

In addition their applications in chemical analysis and in radiochemistry, coprecipitation is "potentially important to many environmental issues closely related to water resources, including acid mine drainage, radionuclide migration in fouled waste repositories, metal contaminant transport at industrial and defense sites, metal concentrations in aquatic systems, and wastewater treatment technology
