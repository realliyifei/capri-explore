## (s22) Carbon footprint (Greenhouse gas emissions)
(p22.0) Cloud data centers consist of a huge number of rows of electricity consuming servers having network, storage, power supply systems along with gigantic HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) units that avoid overheating. However, these data centers appear to be clean but they are not contributing to the green initiative. Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) attributed to data centres in 2018 were 3.15 9 107 tons CO2-eq, accounting for about 0.5% of total GHG emissions in the United States [144]. A little more than half (52%) of total data centre emissions is attributable to the Northeast, Southeast, and Central United States, which have a high concentration of thermoelectric power plants as well as a big number of data centres. Almost 30% of the emissions from the data centre sector occur in the Central United States, which depends significantly on coal and natural gas to satisfy its energy needs.
