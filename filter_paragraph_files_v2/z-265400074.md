## (s4) Burn treatment bandage and leather
(p4.0) Due to presence of type I collagen and high moisture content, tilapia skin is able to withstand mechanical stress e.g.stretching.Tilapia skin bandage in treatment of second-and third-degree burn patients accelerates healing and reduces pain medications, thus, decreases treatment cost by more than 60 % in contrast to conventional treatment.To prepare fish skin bandage, the skin is sterilized chemically, then glycerolized, irradiated and finally stored aseptically in refrigerator [22,23].
