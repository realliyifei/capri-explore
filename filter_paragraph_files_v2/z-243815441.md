## (s12) Optical Fiber-Based Ultrasonic SHM
(p12.0) A recent review by Wu et al. [16] covers much of the literature on FBG sensors for GW detection prior to 2018. So, the primary focus of this paper is on fiber optic sensors other than FBG sensors for GW detection, and more recent advances in FBGs for GW detection. Similar to Wu et al. [16] we classify SHM processes into impact detection, acousto-ultrasonic (using actuators and sensors) or acoustic emission. The distinction is made typically on the source of the ultrasonic signal, the amount of energy in the system, and the dominant frequency range.
## (s14) SHM Using FBG Sensors
(p14.0) FBG-based techniques indeed are the most popular among the FO sensor technologies for GW-based SHM. Since the review paper by Wu et al. [16] in 2018, more papers have been published for GW-based SHM using FBG sensors than all other optical fiber sensors combined. Therefore, we divide this section into the different SHM processes using FBG sensors.
