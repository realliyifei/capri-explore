## (s5) Identifying drug targets in the designing of a new generation of psychotropic drugs
(p5.0) There is a limitation in standard pharmacological treatment related to MDD and related disorders [100].Approximately 30 % of people with a MDD are unresponsive to antidepressants, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [101].

(p5.1) Moncrieff et al. [102] recently in a systematic review tried to clarify the relationship between serotonin activity and depression.The review found no evidence that people with depression have lower serotonin activity than people without depression.Additionally, the methods used to limit the availability of serotonin by depleting tryptophan did not always make the participants' moods worse.As a result, there is no strong evidence supporting the serotonin hypothesis that depression has a biochemical basis.The authors concluded that a more durable theory may be required because the serotonin theory of depression may not be empirically supported.
## (s6) Dietary targets and lifestyle modifications to combat inflammation, depression, and metabolic syndrome
(p6.0) Metabolic syndrome is a multifaceted pathophysiological condition primarily associated with an imbalance in calorie intake.Other factors like an individual's genetic/epigenetic makeup, the prevalence of inactive lifestyles with less physical activity, aging, hormonal imbalance, food quality and composition, and gut microbes also contribute to the development of MS.Recent research connected gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal illnesses to the gut microbiota.Consuming probiotics may be an option for treating and preventing anxiety and depression as dysbiosis and peripheral inflammation of the gut have been linked to the development of several mental illnesses, including anxiety and depression [62,133].

(p6.1) A healthy gut microbiota transmits brain signals via neuronal transmission, microglial activation, neurogenesis, and behavioral control pathways in both stable and stressful environments, according to another review by Limbana et al. [134].Changes in the gut microbiome can lead to the production of microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), causing inflammatory reactions.These signals are then relayed to the vagus nerve, which can result in behavioral changes.The review concluded that dietary decisions substantially impact the endocrine, immunological, and gastrointestinal systems, among other bodily systems.Whereas high-fat consumption leads to obesity and inflammation of body systems, a healthy diet and probiotics reduce anxiety and sadness by improving the gut flora.
