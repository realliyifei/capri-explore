## (s6) Non-extremal five-dimensional black hole
(p6.0) We have explained above how to construct from first principles the BPS (hence extremal) version of the 5D black hole solution. We will now present an algorithm (without proof and specialized to intersections of M2) of how to generalize these constructions to their non-extremal (nonsupersymmetric) versions [39]: Rule 1: In the transverse part of the metric (including time) make the following substitution:
## (s17) Thus, for S(3) the distinct conjugacy classes can be represented as (1)(2)(3), (12)(3), (123).
(p17.0) The fields x i A , ψ aα A in a sector (n i , l i ) appear as a collection of n 1 strings of length l 1 plus n 2 strings of length l 2 , etc. [62] For example, in the maximally twisted sector, corresponding to the maximal cycle of length m, the boundary condition on the bosonic coordinate is
## (s32) Fixed scalar
(p32.0) The above example describes the emission/absorption of any scalar that couples only to the five-dimensional Einstein metric. It is clear from the type II Lagrangian in five dimensions (95) that not all scalars are that way. For example, consider scalar fluctuations described by (ds 2 10 ) T 5 = e 2ν 5 dx 2 5 + e 2ν (dx 2 6 + dx 2 7 + dx 2 8 + dx 2 9 ) (139)
