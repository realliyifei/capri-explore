(p16.0) Syed Nasir et al. [80] presented mitigation of harmonic distortion caused by indicting station at the selected bus rates. The authors in this paper are concluding that the proposed algorithm, modified LSA, got appropriate positions and best dimensions of multiple variable passive filters (VPF). The proposed modified LSA is introduced to find twenty-two units of VPF coordination considering the varying of patterns, harmonic impact, reducing power loss, less harmonious based on 415V bus to the medium-voltage network. Power system harmonious flow, VPF, CS, battery models have been built and analyzed by MATLAB/mfile platform. The results illustrated that the proposed algorithm archived better results in comparison with other optimization methods.
