## (s20) Implications for research
(p20.0) The GRADE system was applied to evaluate the certainty of evidence for using FMT to treat UC, where the majority of comparisons were rated as moderate or low, suggesting that additional studies may have a significant impact on the level of confidence in the estimate of effect or could even change estimate.As for sample size, the vast majority of the primary trials included were considered as having a small sample size, which was the main reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence of primary trials.Small trials could increase the risk of small-trail biases and relevant issues of publication bias, because small negative trials are less likely to reach full publication, which can result in overly positive results in comparisons [45,46].Thus, more future trials using a standard FMT protocol (such as best timing, total dosage, frequency, delivery route, and the best donor) with greater participant motivation and larger sample size are needed.
## (s21) Strengths and limitations
(p21.0) To the best of our knowledge, this was the first overview of SRs/Mas that investigated the efficacy of using FMT for UC treatment.By systematically collecting, evaluating, and synthesizing the evidence for FMT for UC, the findings of this study could facilitate evidence-based decision-making process [47].However, assessing methodological quality, reporting quality, and evidence quality could be a subjective process, as a result, outcomes may differ depending on the decisions made by various researchers in evaluating each factor.Furthermore, reviews that included both UC patients and Crohn's disease patients were excluded, which may lead to selection bias.
