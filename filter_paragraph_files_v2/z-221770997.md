## (s9) Electroluminescence (El) from FLG
(p9.0) Essig and coworker reported phonon-assisted electroluminescence from a few-layer graphene (FLG) structure and metallic SWNT. The visible spectrum with peaks at 1.4 and 1.8 eV was reported from SWNT (diameter range of 0.7 to 1.5 nm); the comparable response was found in multiwall carbon nanotubes. The light emission spectra from SWNT and their evolution with applied voltage is illustrated in Figure 13a,b. Moreover, the spectral photon flux dn/(dt dE) (photons/second) and electron-volt were calculated from intensity I (count per second) as in Equation (6):

(p9.1) where Δλ is the bandwidth, E is the energy in eV, c the speed of light, s is the sensitivity in the diffraction mode, and h is the Planck constant in eV·s. Besides, the emission spectral curve can be deconvoluted into two Gaussians curves with center at ~1.35 and ~1.76 eV, with a full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of 0.28 and 0.24 eV, respectively. Moreover, a slight change in FWHM, and the value of peak energy was reported under an applied voltage. However, the exponential increment in emission intensity was also observed with the increment of bias voltage, as shown in Figure 13c. The phonon-assisted electroluminescence from SWNT and FLG was illustrated in Figure 13d. In addition, the phonons in the Γ-K direction with momentum ≤ 0.5|ΓK| is responsible for the momentum of electronic transition from M to K. Within this momentum range, it is the longitudinal optical (LO) branch, which is closest to ΔE/2 ≈ 0.2 eV, and hence most likely can provide the phonon involved in the emission process. In contrast, the TO branch with ~0.17 eV at a wave vector 0.5|ΓK| is slightly lower in energy [62]. The electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of those branches strongly depends on the position of the Fermi energy level EF with respect to the charge neutrality point E0. At EF = E0, the EPC for the LO and TO phonons is large only at the Γ and K points, respectively [164]. Lastly, all the electroluminescence emissions of graphene discussed in section 4 are summarized in Table 3.
