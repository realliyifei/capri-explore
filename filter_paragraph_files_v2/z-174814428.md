## (s12) Targeting Wnt Signaling as a Novel Therapeutic Option
(p12.0) There are numerous relationships between Wnt signaling, immune function, and cancer progression; most notable is that of increased Wnt signaling correlating with decreased tumor T cell infiltration, as discussed above. Wnt pathways have a vast number of roles that offer multiple options for pathway modulation in the malignant setting. The United States Patent and Trade Office Patent and Patent Application databases report 103 unique Wnt signaling modulators being investigated, with 34 in clinic trials [101]. Actions of these therapies range from the signal pathway component targeting activators to Wnt inhibitors. Many intriguing investigations are evaluating tumor immunity with drug intervention. Understanding the immunomodulation of these therapies will be essential during attempts to transition the TME to a less resistant milieu.
