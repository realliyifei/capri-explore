## (s5) Double flag varieties associated to Borel subgroups
(p5.0) Let us assume that either (1) G is a simple algebraic group, which is simply connected, and K = G θ is the fixed point subgroup of an involution θ as above; or

(p5.1) (2) G = G 1 × G 1 with K = ∆G 1 , which is the fixed point subgroup of the "flip" (see § 4.2 around Equation (4.1)). Here G 1 is a simple, simply connected algebraic group.

(p5.2) Note that in both cases K is connected. For a double flag variety X = K/Q × G/P , if one of P or Q is a Borel subgroup of G or K respectively, then there is a complete classification of X of finite type in this setting due to He-N-Ochiai-Oshima [HNOO13].
## (s11) Orbits in the double flag variety of type AIII
(p11.0) In this section, we show a concrete example of classification of orbits in a double flag variety by using quiver representations. Thus we focus on the category of quiver representations J (a, b, c) and the double flag variety X((a ′ , b ′ ); c) of type AIII (cf. [FN20,FN23]). We summarize the notation which will be used below:

(p11.1) • n = p + q, r ≤ n are positive integers, and we set a = (1 p , q), b = (1 q , p), c = (r, n − r);

(p11.2) bases (e 1 , . . . , e n ) = (e + 1 , . . . , e + p , e − 1 , . . . , e − q );
