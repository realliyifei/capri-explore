## (s30) Technical Problems
(p30.0) Low enzyme yield, low enzyme titre and low enzyme productivity are all mainly caused due to technical problems that prevent microorganisms to thrive on lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Some of these technical problems include the inability to control the C:N ratio due to the addition of nitrogen rich cellulases and hemicellulases, low sugar concentrations and the presence of 5-C and 6-C sugars, causing diauxic growth. However, the major issue associated with the use of lignocellulose for fermentation is the presence of microbial inhibitors: furfural, hydroxymethyl furfural, acetic acid, phenolic compounds and other chemical species. These compounds are a by-product of lignin breakdown during harsh pretreatments. The mechanism of how phenolic compounds inhibit growth is not understood completely. Vanillin, syringaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, and hydroxybenzoic acid are some of the compounds that inhibit enzyme activity [102].
