## (s8) MULTITUDE OF FUNCTIONS OF MICROBIAL CONSORTIA IN THE RHIZOSPHERE WITH EMPHASIS ON PHYTOHORMONES, NUTRIENTS, AND MICROBIAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS
(p8.0) Coevolving of plants with microbes follow the symbiotic association in order to colonize the terrestrial ecological systems (Werner et al., 2014). The knowledge of beneficial characteristics of natural PGPRs and their interactions could support the agriculture by decreasing the utilization of chemical-based fertilizers and enhancing the plant productivity. Among several traits displayed by PGPRs, the direct properties include the nutrient assimilation, phytohormone secretion and signaling, and biological nitrogen (N 2 ) fixation and siderophore production for making iron available to the plants (Figure 2C), and indirect ones include pathogen suppression, e.g., by releasing gaseous substances such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN), inducing ISR and SAR and ACC deaminase enzyme production for reducing the concentration of ET in plants.
