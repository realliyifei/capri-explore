## (s13) 1-dimensional methods
(p13.0) The techniques presented in the previous chapters all operate in two horizontal dimensions.However, several types of situations exist in which data are only available along a single line, and not on a two-dimensional area.Among the most frequent of such situations are data from the pass of a single satellite, or from chains of magnetometers.In such cases, if the analysis of a single event is considered, two-dimensional analysis techniques naturally cannot be applied.Still, several of the 2-D techniques can be reduced to 1-dimensional variants (cf.Table 1) and thus be applied with data along a single line, provided that a horizontal direction exists in which the derivative of the measured data is, to a reasonable approximation, vanishing.This section presents 1-dimensional variants of several of the techniques that were reviewed in the previous section, and also discusses how to validate the 1-D assumption, and how to find an optimal coordinate system for the 1-D approach.

(p13.1) Before a 1-D analysis approach is applied to a data set, it is necessary to verify how well the 1-D assumption is realized in the case under study.While in theory, the term "1-D situation" is unambiguously defined as a situation with vanishing derivative of all measurements in one horizontal direction, in reality such a strict definition is hardly ever realized.For the practical application, the term "1-D situation" therefore refers to an approximation of the theoretical situation, which is defined by certain conditions that the measured data must fulfill.As examples, we discuss these conditions here for two typical cases in which 1-D methods are used: Magnetic field data from the overpass of a single low-orbiting satellite, and a from a magnetometer chain on the ground.Below, the www.ann-geophys.net/29/467/2011/Ann.Geophys., 29, 467-491, 2011 term "null gradient direction" corresponds to the direction in which the derivatives are (approximately) vanishing, and the term "1-D direction" to the direction perpendicular to this.

(p13.2) Using the assumption that the magnetic field disturbance that a low-orbiting satellite measures stems from the ionospheric currents and the FAC only, it is easy to see from an expansion of the current into 1-D SECS (Sect.2.3) that the B r and B θ components of the magnetic field disturbance are not independent of each other for a 1-D situation, since both are solely generated by the J φ current component.(Here the coordinate system (r ,θ ,φ ) refer to the spherical coordinates with respect to the pole of the 1-D SECS.)Juusola et al. (2007) have used this fact to apply the following procedure: For a given pole position of the 1-D SECS systems, the J φ component of the current is computed only from the B r component of the measured magnetic field disturbance.The resulting J φ currents create a B θ ,calc magnetic field disturbance, which in a perfect 1-D situation would be equal to the measured B θ .The magnetic data of an overpass is defined as 1-D if a position of the 1-D SECS pole can be found for which the error between B θ ,calc and B θ is smaller than a certain limit.The position of the 1-D SECS pole for which this error is smallest, which is found by an optimization technique, defines the optimum 1-D coordinate system for that particular overpass.Figure 8 illustrates the error in B θ as a function of the location of the 1-D SECS pole position, and the path how the optimization technique finds the 1-D SECS pole location with the lowest B θ error.
