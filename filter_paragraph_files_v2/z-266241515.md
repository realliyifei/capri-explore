## (s13) CVD Risk
(p13.0) As shown in Table 3, vessel wall volume had increased in both groups by the end of the intervention conducted by Jenkins et al. [41].However, the increase was significant only in the control group and difference between groups was not significant.There was also no significant changes in Framingham risk score in this study.
## (s18) Quality of Life
(p18.0) Alalwan and colleagues [31] applied the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) to their participants to measure quality of life (Table 3).Both the total score and the specific mental health score significantly increased in the intervention group, suggesting an increased quality of life in the participants from the intervention group.Moreover, significant differences were observed between groups (intervention vs. control, p < 0.05).
