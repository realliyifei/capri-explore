## (s6) Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)
(p6.0) One of the tests that is most frequently used to assess anxiety-like behavior is the EPM test. The experiment takes advantage of mice's innate fear of high, open areas as well as their intrinsic curiosity about unfamiliar environments. The apparatus has a central area with open and closed arms that are crossed perpendicularly in the middle. The mice have access to each arm and can roam freely between them. The number of entries and the length of time mice spend in open arms are signs of anxiety brought on by open spaces [41].
## (s9) Single Prolonged Stress (SPS)
(p9.0) SPS is a procedure that exposes the animal to traumatic levels of stress. It entails sequential exposure to three stressors over the course of one continuous session. This strategy was initially designed to induce a significant stress reaction through three different mechanisms: constraint, forced group swimming, and medication (ether). Each session consists of 2 h of restraint, a 20 min group swim, and ether exposure until loss of consciousness. This incubation period, also known as a sensitization period, lasts 7 days on average. This procedure induces post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms such as depression and anxiety [44].
