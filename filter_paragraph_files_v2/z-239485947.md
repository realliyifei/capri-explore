## (s5) Gait Analysis Definitions
(p5.0) Gait analysis is one of the most commonly used methods to detect frailty and fall risk in elderly people [16]. It consists of identifying the different phases of the gait cycle and extracting their characteristic parameters. As mentioned above, frailty is directly related to changes in gait, namely slower gait speed. As frailty increases, mobility capacity decreases and gait changes become more evident. Through gait analysis and quantification of the gait parameters, differences can be found between robust, prefrail, and frail patients. These differences allow discriminating between patient groups, to diagnose frailty, and to provide early medical attention.
