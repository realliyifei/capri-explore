## (s25) The control of biofouling in seaweed aquaculture
(p25.0) The economic feasibility of seaweed aquaculture requires the control of various factors, including biofouling (Zuniga-Jara and Marin-Riffo 2016; Kim et al. 2017). Prevention, inhibition and treatment of biofouling on commercially cultivated seaweed species includes understanding and harnessing the natural antifouling defences of seaweeds, and strategic farm management and husbandry practices.
