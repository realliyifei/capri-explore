## (s4) II. PRELIMINARIES ON GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS
(p4.0) In the last few years, learning on graph structures has gained significant relevance in the community, thanks to their intrinsic capability to easily process data lying on irregular domains, such as three-dimensional point clouds, spatiotemporal and functional relationships [14]- [17].Similarly to what Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) did for standard images, the community has devoted significant effort in defining convolution-based aggregation mechanisms for graph structures.
## (s12) IV. GNNS FOR MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS
(p12.0) In multi-agent systems, an effective coordination and communication between robots is of paramount importance to enable a fruitful cooperation, which is clearly critical for several downstream tasks.Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by exploiting centralised approaches, where all the intelligence and computation complexity is centralised on a common controller node, which collects information from the environment, plan and then communicate single actions to each robot to fulfil the desired task.Such an approach has the strong benefit of having a central control system able to reason on the current (and past) status of the whole set of agents and the surrounding environment, thus requiring only little computation on the device side for action execution.However, this approach has a low fault tolerance: if even a single agent fails, all the actions of the robots need to be recomputed.Centralised solutions also badly scale with the increase of agents, and for difficult tasks it even requires additional per-robot computation [133].

(p12.1) To address these issues, recently many researchers devoted their attention to decentralised approaches, where each agent learns its set of actions according to environmental data and shared information from other agents.In this configuration, each robot has to deal with limited observability due to the range of the sensors, each robot can only see a partial portion of the environment and can communicate with the nearest agents.GNNs offer generalized and flexible structural representations of the elements in multi-robot systems, and have been recently widely used in decentralised approaches to adress several tasks.
