## (s16) F. Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM)
(p16.0) Self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs) form a class of neural networks.They can be used for either classification or dimensionality reduction.Burnap et al. [12] used SOFMs to reduce the features dimensionality.Once a sample is received, it runs through a virtual environment for 5 minutes.The chosen nine machine activity metrics, mentioned in section II.F, are taken every second, producing 300 vectors of nine values for each sample, in the 5-minute time window.Then, SOFMs are used to transform each 9-dimensional vector to a 2-dimensional vector.Therefore, 300 vectors of x-y coordinates are used as features for the training of the model.
## (s22) V. CLASSIFICATION OF THE STUDIED RESEARCHES
(p22.0) There are several indicators to measure the performance of a given classifier.For the classification of the different studied researches, this paper was interested in the accuracy rate of each one of them.Accuracy is defined as the number of malicious files classified as malicious, plus the number of benign files classified as benign, divided by the total number of files.Table 3 shows our results taking into account the most important researches.

(p22.1) We should mention that Burnap et al. [12] didn"t calculate the accuracy in their experiments.They used instead the precision rate.It is the number of malicious files classified as malicious, divided by the number of all the files classified as malicious.

(p22.2) Several researches investigated in this paper use the k-fold cross-validation.It is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.The technique partitions the existing dataset into iterative learning and test subsets.It is applied to estimate the efficiency of a machine learning model on unseen data.However, since it does not use a completely new subset for the final test of the model, this can lead to an overfitting of the training data, the model subsequently would fail to perfectly generalize to previously unseen data.Therefore, an important factor is to check whether a classification model could generalize from previously seen data in the model training, to new data exclusively used for the last test phase.
