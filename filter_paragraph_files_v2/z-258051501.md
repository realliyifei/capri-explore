## (s31) Interocular di erences
(p31.0) Our earlier measures with binocular 3D scleral search coils in healthy subjects during a head impulse showed that the two eyes do not move exactly conjugately. Thus, for the leftward impulses, the left eye showed a higher gain than the right eye and vice versa, for rightward head impulses the right eye showed a higher gain than the left eye. In other words: it is the adducting eye which has the higher gain with a side difference of ca. 15% between the two eyes (80). This is probably a cause of some of the sidedness differences which have been reported in the past in carrying out these tests.
