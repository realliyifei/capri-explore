## (s27) HYPERTENSION
(p27.0) Like other comorbidities, the link between shift work and hypertension is not completely understood. Considering that shift work schedules may predispose workers to inappropriate behaviours such as smoking, poor eating habits and poor balance between work and personal life, and potentiate the activation of the autonomic nervous system, inflammation, and other metabolic syndromes, it is likely that this type of workers have a higher risk of hypertension (Puttonen et al., 2010).
