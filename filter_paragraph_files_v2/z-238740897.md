## (s8) Effect of Metformin Treatment on Human Urine Metabolome
(p8.0) Cho et al. [84] studied the metabolomic changes in 14 healthy volunteers in response to single-dose metformin treatment (1000 mg). In particular, four metabolites, including cortisol, retinyl Î²-glucuronide, betaine, and cholic acid glucuronide, were identified and quantified by LC-MS analysis in this study. Among them, cortisol and its metabolite hydroxycortisol were significantly decreased after metformin administration. According to Park et al. [85], the response to metformin in early-phase T2DM patients could be predicted by their urine metabolomic profiles acquired from GC-MS, which showed significantly different metabolites as markers of metformin response. In particular, citric acid and hippuric acid were higher and myoinositol was lower in the metformin responder group than the non-responder group. These results suggested that metabolic differences enabled them to discriminate between the metformin responder and non-responder groups efficiently.
