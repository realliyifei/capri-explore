## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Coronavirus, an RNA virus from the Coronaviridae family is the responsible agent for the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 An epigenetic change influences the immunological response to infections, including COVID-19. The gender-based influence has been observed in several respiratory and autoimmune disorders. 2 The propensity of mortality rate due to COVID-19 was significantly higher in females than in males. Notably, social norms, financial and non-financial barriers to women's access to healthcare have proposed to negatively impact women's testing for COVID-19 and access to adequate care, resulting in underreporting of female cases and deaths due to COVID-19. 3 It has been suggested that sex differences in immunopathogenesis may be suggestive of mechanisms of COVID-19 based on the available sex-disaggregated epidemiological data from the COVID-19 pandemic. This could help identify points for improved vaccine design and therapeutics to increase the efficacy of the vaccine.
