## (s6) | Ex vivo gene therapy benefits and challenges
(p6.0) Ex vivo gene therapy is the genetic modification of cells outside the body, followed by transplantation. These cells could be differentiated somatic cells or stem/progenitor cells. 62 The main advantages of this ex vivo approach include the selective targeting of the cell population of interest, the avoidance of immune defences and the implementation of quality control systems before the genetically modified cells are reimplanted. In this section, we will focus on differentiated somatic cells that retain sufficient replicative capacity to allow extraction, modification outside the body and re-implantation.
## (s15) MANIPULATION OF POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL RNA PROCESSING AND TRANSLATION
(p15.0) Gene expression levels can be modulated after transcription using synthetic nucleic acid molecules able to interfere with splicing, translation or RNA degradation, without directly altering the cell's genetic material ( Figure 10). 148 Diseases resulting from gain-of-function mutants are particularly amenable to this intervention method.
