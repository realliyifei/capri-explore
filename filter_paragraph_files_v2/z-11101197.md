## (s11) Nephrotoxicity.
(p11.0) Nephrotoxicity is a known adverse effect of polymyxins. Older studies and case reports suggested high incidence of nephrotoxicity but no objective definition of renal dysfunction was available and was referred mainly with intramuscular administration. Polymyxin B was reported to be associated with a higher incidence of renal toxicity compared to colistin/colistimethate sodium. But recent literature suggests lower nephrotoxicity rates even with polymyxin B. Increased membrane permeability leading to cell swelling due to influx of water and ions and resultant cell death is the suggested mechanism of renal injury due to polymyxin B. Fatty acid and D-amino acid component are considered to be responsible for cell injury. Nephrotoxicity due to polymyxin B is dose-dependent [48]. A brief review of recent studies of polymyxin B associated nephropathy is discussed below.
