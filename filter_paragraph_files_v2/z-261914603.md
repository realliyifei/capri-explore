## (s1) Methods
(p1.0) The protocol for this study was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42022367811). 1 The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline (15).
## (s2) Literature search and selection criteria
(p2.0) From the beginning of the databases up to April 2023, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science.The search strategy employed a combination of keywords related to "acetylcysteine, " "N-acetylcysteine, " "contrastinduced nephropathy, " "contrast-induced acute kidney injury, " "metaanalysis, " and "randomized controlled trial." A full list of search terms is available in Supplementary Table S1.Additional relevant studies were identified by manually searching the reference lists of eligible papers.We did not apply any language restrictions.

(p2.1) We included studies that met the following criteria: they were meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials that examined the association between NAC use and contrast-induced nephropathy, with no restrictions on comparators or populations.If multiple meta-analyses were available for the same research topic, we selected the one with the largest dataset, as previously described elsewhere (16,17).We excluded articles without complete text, reviews, meta-analyses of studies with different study designs, and those without a control group.

(p2.2) Two independent reviewers (R.Zhu.and B.D.) screened the titles and abstracts of the articles, followed by a full-text evaluation of potentially eligible articles.Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (P.L.).
## (s3) Data extraction and assessment of evidence credibility
(p3.0) To ensure the accuracy of the data, two reviewers (R. Zhu. and R. Zheng.)conducted separate data extractions, which were then verified by a third reviewer (Y.R.W.).Both the meta-analyses and individual studies were used as sources for the data.Main outcome was rate of CIN and secondary outcomes were Scr, requirement for dialysis, mortality.

(p3.1) To evaluate the analytical integrity of each meta-analysis, the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews, Version 2 (AMSTAR-2) instrument was used.The AMSTAR-2 includes 16 items that evaluate various domains, such as the comprehensive literature search, duplicate study selection and data extraction, and risk of bias assessment.Each domain is assigned a score of "yes, " "partial, " "no, " or "not applicable, " and the overall quality of the meta-analysis is evaluated as extremely low, low, moderate, or high based on the number of elements fulfilled.The AMSTAR-2 tool provides a standardized and objective method for assessing the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which can aid in clinical decision-making and guide future research (18).

(p3.2) To determine the certainty of evidence for each association in the meta-analyses of RCTs, the GRADE criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) were used.The GRADE criteria assess the quality of evidence and generate clinical practice recommendations across five domains, including bias risk, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publishing bias.GRADEpro version 3.6.1 was used to categorize the level of evidence as very low, low, moderate, or high (McMaster University).When making recommendations, GRADE considers the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, financial implications, and feasibility of implementation (19).
