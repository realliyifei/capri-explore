## (s4) C. Wi-Fi Sensing Advantages and Limitations
(p4.0) The advantage of Wi-Fi sensing is its applicability in directly implementing the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure.It also gives an advantage in the deployment cost, finegrained localization (especially using CSI), can locate multi-target, non-intrusive (device-free), and adaptability to environmental change.However, some limitations must be considered in developing Wi-Fi sensing-based indoor localization [13].
## (s7) A. Introduction to CSI
(p7.0) The disadvantage of traditional methods is that the devices must be attached to the object.On the other hand, CSI uses the spectrum change of signal in communication link properties, e.g., amplitude, phase, time, and power, to detect the change and combine it with the specific technique to predict human behavior or activities.

(p7.1) For the non-intrusive nature of the human behavior system, CSI is essential and top choice.Moreover, in Wi-Fi devices, CSI can also be extracted.Another parameter of Wi-Fi can also be used, especially for indoor localization, i.e., received signal strength indicator (RSSI).However, this parameter is known for its high fluctuation in nature and is also accurate enough for coarse localization.CSI is a more "grained" metric than RSSI.CSI can describe amplitude attenuation and phase shift well, which can be used as the foundation of human behavior and lead to indoor localization implementations.Furthermore, CSI can effectively recognize the basic vital signs of complex actions human or inhabitants' activities.The illustration of CSI-based human behavior/activities, which can also be further extended as the indoor localization scenario, is depicted in Figure 2. It also depicts that the target/object does not need to carry any device (device-free).The multipath effects caused by the person's activities can be represented as propagation mechanisms, e.g., reflection, diffraction, and scattering.Reflection is reflected signal from human and surrounding interactive objects (IOs), while diffraction is diffracted signal from the surfaces, while scattering is signals scattered by small objects or sharp edges IOs [6].
