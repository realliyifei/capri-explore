## (s72) Conclusions
(p72.0) Designing multiple activities into one molecule is a challenge but it may simplify pharmacokinetic evaluation as well as patient drug regimes. However, as the size and complexity of the molecule increases, it gets harder to maintain efficacy at each target. Maintaining specific and potent inhibition of the enzyme and receptor targets is a priority. The physical effects (such as iron chelation of antioxidant properties) will often require higher concentrations in the cell than those required for a selective ligand directed towards to a protein target. This raises the question of combining target actions in the right proportion and the most effective MTDL treatment schedules. For example, the neuroprotective effects of l-deprenyl are seen at significantly lower doses lower than those required to inhibit MAO B.

(p72.1) In this context, it should be noted that low doses of l-deprenyl protect cells from radiation damage, by a process that involves elevation of Bcl-2 levels, but this action is lost at higher doses [236]. Thus, the construction of MTDLs that will prove effective at a single dosage regime may require careful adjustment of the activities of some individual moieties if they are to be a viable alternative to the use of combinations of single drugs. The ability to manipulate specifically the integrated network of signalling pathways that control cell survival is at present not possible, but as targets linked to individual diseases (such as PINK/Parkin to Parkinson's disease become better understood, the next generation of new target-directed MTDL may be developed.
