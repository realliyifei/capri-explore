## (s4) Clinical Signs
(p4.0) The incubation period is 4 to 8 days for SPV and 4 to 15 days for GPV and LSD. After its entry into the host, the virus replicates in the tissues. It is localised in the lymph nodes three to four days after a primary viraemia. The virus then spreads throughout the body and affects the liver, lungs, and spleen. Nodules appear 7 to 19 days post-infection. After the appearance of skin lesions in affected animals, they may develop conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and lymphadenopathy, in the prescapular lymph nodes. Excessive salivation can occur after an infection [17].
