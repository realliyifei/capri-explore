## (s24) Non-Endocrine Tumors
(p24.0) Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown antisecretory and antitumor effects of SST in cancer. The exact mechanism of the antitumor effect of SST is unknown, but some options include: inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis (direct effects), decrease in gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and IGF-1 levels directly by suppressing of IGF-1 gene expression or indirectly through inhibition of hepatic production (indirect effects), and peritumoral vasoconstriction that causes a decrease in nutritional support [174]. However, the role and therapeutic potential of SSAs in non-endocrine tumors (breast, colon, prostate, lung, exocrine pancreatic, and hepatocellular) are currently unknown.
