## (s7) A NEW BI-LEVEL OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK FOR REGULARIZATION
(p7.0) All the rules presented in Section 3 for hybrid regularization (ie, first-project-then-regularize) methods (20) have in common that, together with the regularization method itself, can be reformulated as a sequence of problems of the form

(p7.1) where F(x, k ) is the objective function appearing in the first optimization problem in (20) and P k (x k ( k )) is a condition that allows a suitable choice of k ≥ 0 (typically a projected version of the strategies listed in Section 3 and also listed in Table 2). For instance, when using Regińska criterion,
