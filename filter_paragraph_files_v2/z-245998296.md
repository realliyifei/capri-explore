## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Management of peritoneal carcinomatosis of gynecological origin is challenging, despite the great progress in the fields of surgery, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, resulting in poor prognosis and low survival rates, in comparison with patients with parenchymatous metastases. The standard of care for advanced ovarian cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis (PM) is based on complete cytoreduction surgery (CRS) combined with systemic therapy. Hence, the response to systemic intravenous chemotherapy is poor, not only because of molecular mechanisms, but mainly because the drug penetration of systemic chemotherapy into the peritoneal metastases is low. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been proved to be an alternative approach for such cases [1].
## (s6) Discussion
(p6.0) It is without doubt, that the standard treatment for inoperable ovarian cancer patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis is based on systemic chemotherapy. However, the response rates after three lines of chemotherapy or even two lines when it comes to platinum-resistant recurrences are disappointing, mainly because of ineffective intraperi-toneal distribution of the regiments and poor pharmacokinetics. Additionally, systemic chemotherapy is accompanied by high toxicity, tremendously reducing the quality of life of the patients [16].
