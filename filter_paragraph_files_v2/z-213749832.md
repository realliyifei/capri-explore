## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) While the 1st, 2nd and 3rd industrial revolutions (IRs) changed the industries' shop floors through the use of steam power, electrical power and automation, respectively, the 4th IR is about the communication among cyber-physical systems (CPSs) (Schwab 2016). Here, the advances of computing power, intelligent control and connectivity not only lead to the development of smart products but also allow for radical changes in several other areas. As in the previous IRs, sweeping changes in the shop floor are causing a cascading effect of changes through all the processes in the value chains, thus supporting the creation of new business models and allowing for the production of improved products, which are impacting customers' uses and behaviours in new ways.
