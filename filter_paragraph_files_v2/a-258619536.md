## (s8) Unilateral or asymmetrical hilar lymphadenopathy, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy without hilar lymphadenopathy
(p8.0) Asymmetric or unilateral hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy occurs in less than 5% of patients with sarcoidosis overall (24) but is more common after 50 years of age ( Figure 1B) (24).

LLM judge: YES

## (s29) When is the differential diagnosis most difficult?
(p29.0) Sarcoidosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in patients with rare and atypical radiological presentations such as unilateral hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, necrotic lymphadenopathy, predominantly bronchiolar micronodular infiltration or miliary, lung cavitations, or pleural effusion. These presentations should suggest tuberculosis, particularly in endemic regions (section 3.1.1.). The absence of caseating granulomas does not rule out tuberculosis (103). In all patients, including those with imaging-study findings typical for sarcoidosis, mycobacteria should be sought in biopsy specimens and, if performed, by BAL.

LLM judge: YES

## (s42) Granulomatous talcosis
(p42.0) Pulmonary granulomatous talcosis can produce radiological abnormalities resembling those seen in sarcoidosis (section 3.1.3.) (39). A history of inhaled or intravenous drug abuse suggests the diagnosis. Confirmation is provided by lung biopsy, which shows small diffuse granulomas at the level of the terminal or respiratory bronchioles, with birefringent bodies within giant cells by polarized light microscopy (129). These lesions are more similar to foreign-body granulomas than to sarcoid granulomas.

LLM judge: YES
