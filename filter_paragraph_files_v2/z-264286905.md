## (s7) Macro fungi as biofertilizers
(p7.0) A collection of microbiomes that interact with plant roots affects plant development and defense.Numerous bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and other eukaryotic microorganisms can be cultivated in microbiomes.Rhizobacteria are the bacteria that live in the rhizosphere and improve plant development and crop yield.The most essential plant growth-promoting fungi are Penicillium, Trichoderma, Fusarium, and Phoma.The cucumber has developed systemic resistance to many diseases due to the presence of many plant growthpromoting fungi species (Romera et al. 2019).These fungi are non-pathogenic saprophytes that live in soil and aid crop plants by protecting them from disease as well as boosting plant growth (Begum et al. 2019) (Table 7).
