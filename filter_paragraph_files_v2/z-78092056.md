## (s22) Attempts to Categorize and Prioritize (Unmet) Needs
(p22.0) In 2018, a large systematic review analyzed current literature on unmet care needs of advanced cancer patients' informal caregivers. First, the authors had to state that current data are characterized by significant heterogeneity regarding study contexts, assessment methods, measurement instruments, classifications, and report methods. Further, the majority of studies evaluated unmet needs in cross-sectional designs. However, they worked out that "information" was the central theme in the context of unmet needs. The two main information categories were either "illness or treatment information" (26-100%), or "care-related information" (21-100%) [72].
## (s31) Supporting Relatives by Development of Support Plans
(p31.0) The Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool (CSNAT) approach aims to expand the focus of discharge planning on caregivers' support needs, to strengthen the carers' role in end-of-life care and to prevent patients from hospital readmission due to decompensation of home care, which was deemed feasible by carers and health care professionals [41]. In addition, the CSNAT intervention seems to reduce early grief, improve psychological and physical health as well as the perception that the "place of death was the right" in family carers compared to the control group, and to increase the rate of patients dying at home [41]. Thomsen et al. evaluated a four-step process evaluation of systematic risk and needs assessment for caregivers in specialized palliative care. They were able to include 46% of their family caregivers in the intervention. The first steps, an interdisciplinary risk assessment and documentation of a support plan could be performed in 75%, whilst the final step, a separate medical record according to the intervention blueprint, could be completed in 62% of caregivers. The palliative care staff perceived that this intervention was useful and acceptable, but efficacy data are pending [35].
## (s32) Supporting Relatives in Symptom Management
(p32.0) Another new intervention, the "Cancer Carers Medicines Management" was developed to support carers with the management of pain medication in advanced cancer patients during end-of-life care. This approach was also feasible and acceptable for participating carers and nurses, however efficacy data have not yet been presented. In addition, the authors highlight the typical recruitment problems in studies including relatives or carers, when eligible participants remain fewer than expected and the so called "gate-keeping effect" occurs, meaning that health care professionals rate many potential participants as unsuitable for participation to prevent them from additional burden [42].
## (s35) Effects of Integrated Palliative Care
(p35.0) A multinational mixed-methods study indicated that there is some evidence that integrated palliative care initiatives with "well-developed professional care networks and communication systems" might reduce burden in family caregivers by direct (e.g., provision of night shift nurses) and indirect effects (psychological support). However, systematic or institutionalized support structures for family caregivers were not established in any country [70].
## (s38) Effects of Palliative Home Care Services
(p38.0) Potential effects of a palliative home care service were explored in a Spanish content analysis that evaluated written gratitude documents from bereaved relatives. They could work out three different content categories: "recognition of the care received and the value of particular aspects", "family recognition of the achievements of the palliative care team", and "messages of support related to the need of resources provided". The authors highlight the key role of relational aspects as an indicator for high quality palliative care [54].
