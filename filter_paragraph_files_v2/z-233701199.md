## (s4) Pregnancy induced gingival enlergement
(p4.0) The prevalence of pregnancy gingivitis changes from 35-100%. The gingiva shows increased level of infl ammation often characterized by edema, colour and contour change and propensity to bleed on gentle stimulation ( Figure 2). The marginal gingival tends to be more prominent than facial and lingual surfaces. And infl ammatory reaction to the local irritants that occurs after 3 rd month of pregnancy is called pregnancy tumour. This lesion appears as discrete, mushroom, fl attened spherical masses, that protrude from gingival margin, more frequently interproximal space and are attached by sessile or pedanculated base [6].
