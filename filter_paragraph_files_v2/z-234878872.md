## (s18) Hard Metals
(p18.0) Consolidation of hard metals by EDC has been tested by several researchers. WC-20Co powders with WC grain size <5 µm were successfully processed by applying an external pressure of 200 MPa and a current density of up to 95 kA/cm 2 [90]. Relative density of up to 99% was attained at the time that maintaining the WC size and a hardness of 78 ± 2 HRA was measured (see Figure 16). Higher current densities caused the disintegration of the material, creating big pores and reducing hardness to 46 ± 6 HRA.
