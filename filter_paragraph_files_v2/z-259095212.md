## (s14) Special considerations in older adults
(p14.0) The adverse effects of cocaine use have been well documented in the general population, and while there are limited data on the adverse effects specifically seen in older adults, the assumption can be made that adverse effects are likely the same or even more devastating in older adults. Cocaine use has been associated with cardiovascular (left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease, aortic or cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, and vasospasm), pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular (stroke, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, aneurysm rupture, and cerebral ischemia), hematologic (prothrombotic properties), and psychiatric complications [1]. A recent study by Soder et al. found that cocaine use disorder could further increase inflammatory burden in older adults [51]. Older adults are likely at an increased risk of adverse effects of cocaine use, and cocaine should be avoided in this population, especially considering that there are no cited medical benefits for cocaine use outside of surgical procedures.

(p14.1) The treatments of choice for cocaine use disorder in older adults are CBT and CM programs, similar to that of the general population [52]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of treatments for cocaine use in the general population found that CM programs were consistently associated with decreased cocaine use, measured with urinalysis, while other treatment options such as psychotherapy, placebo, opioids, psychostimulants, anticonvulsants, dopamine agonists, antidepressants, and antipsychotics were not associated with decreased use [53].
## (s21) Treatment
(p21.0) CBT has been shown to aid in discontinuing benzodiazepines; randomized controlled trials showed that the proportion of discontinuing benzodiazepines was significantly higher when patients participated in CBT plus gradual tapering than in gradual tapering alone both in the short and long term [74]. More research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of such therapeutic modalities specifically in older adults.
