## (s15) Flow resistance
(p15.0) We will introduce a new parameter that measures how far apart a cubic graph is from having a nowhere-zero 4-flow. By Theorem 4.2 this is also a complexity measure for snarks. Let G be a cubic graphs and r f (G) = min{|E(G)−supp(D, φ)| : (D, φ) is a 4-flow on G}. For the Petersen graph P we have r f (P ) = γ 2 (P ) = 1, r(P ) = ω (P ) = ω(P ) = 2, and µ 3 (P ) = 3. Proof. Let M 1 and M 2 be two 1-factors such that |M 1 ∩ M 2 | = γ 2 (G), and F 1 and F 2 be the complementary 2-factors, respectively. For i ∈ {1, 2} let (D i , φ i ) be a nowhere-zero i-flow on F i . The sum of (D 1 , φ 1 ) and (D 2 , φ 2 ) is a 4-flow (D, φ) on G with |E(G) − supp(D, φ)| = γ 2 (G).

(p15.1) In [110] Steffen showed that if G is a cyclically 6-edge-connected cubic graph with γ 2 (G) ≤ 2, then G has a nowhere-zero 5-flow. With view on Theorem 3.2 the bound of Proposition 4.1 might not be the best upper bound, see Conjecture 5.5 in Section 5.
