## (s3) RESULTS
(p3.0) During the research, we found 512 studies related to the subject, of which 19 were used for the review. The flowchart of the inclusion process is presented in Figure 1.

(p3.1) The total number of children evaluated in the studies selected was 4,472, with an average age of respiratory tract infections (URTI), such as diphtheria, were one of the most common reasons for performing the procedure. With the implementation of new immunization programs, the epidemiological profiles of infections have changed, which reduced the need for the procedure 2 . Currently, the indications for tracheostomy are acute respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, neurological disorders or lesions; the first two are the most common. Such indications increase the survival of children, especially of newborns, which results in an increased frequency of the procedure in pediatric patients 1, 3 .

(p3.2) Despite the benefits, children who undergo tracheostomy are more susceptible to respiratory infections. The presence of the tube diverts the air passage from the nasal and oral cavities, which provide natural protection, and creates a direct doorway for micro-organisms to enter the lower respiratory tract. The mucociliary clearance of the nasal mucosa and coughing, which clean the lower airways by expelling secretions and possible intruding agents, are also absent in these cases. Similarly, the long-term presence of the tube causes an inflammatory reaction of the tracheal mucosa, which increases the risk of infection since this is a strategic location for the colonization of several bacteria and for biofilm formation 4-6 .

(p3.3) Biofilm is easily formed in this region because bacteria adhere strongly to the surfaces of tubes, forming a matrix that confers protection against various types of attacks, such as from the action of the immune system and antibiotics, which results in subsequent infections with greater frequency 5 . Bacterial pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and bacterial tracheitis were the pathologies reported with greater frequency in children who underwent tracheotomy, and bacterial pneumonia was for the highest number of hospitalizations 7 .
## (s4) DISCUSSION
(p4.0) We found in the present review several reports of tracheostomy in pediatric age patients, especially in children younger than 12 months 1,6,16,19 , because the procedure is directly related to the increase of survival both of premature newborns with congenital malformations and of children of other ages who require mechanical ventilation for any particular purpose.

(p4.1) In relation to gender, from a total of 19 studies, 16 reported tracheotomy procedures with a greater frequency in male children 1,3,4,6-15,17-20 . This finding reflects the susceptibility of the gender to genetic or acquired diseases that require tracheostomy, which was also reported in another study on congenital diseases 9 .
