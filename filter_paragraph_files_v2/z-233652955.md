## (s8) RL-Based RM
(p8.0) An RM framework that uses RL as a robust and nonparametric generic optimization scheme that allows controlling of discretized partial differential equations was presented in [54]. An algorithm that enables experience sharing between agents and specialization of each agent due to multi-task learning to train Neural Networks (NNs), that was denoted from Mutual Weights Regularization (MWR), was also tested. MWR is an NN training approach that allows RL to learn a policy in a multi-agent environment without the curse of dimensionality due to the number of agents. Applied to RM's actual traffic control problem, a model-free approach achieves a comparable control level to the currently used model-dependent implementation of the ALINEA algorithm. The results show that the average speed is globally increased while the total number of vehicles on the motorway is decreased. The MWR approach resulted in a significant performance improvement, almost reaching the performance of the ALINEA algorithm in both cases.
