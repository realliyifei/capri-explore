(p4.0) Note: RA, rheumatoid arthritis; OA, osteoarthritis; LN, lupus nephritis; erythematosus; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pDM, primary dermatomyositis; SSc, systemic sclerosis; FLSs, fibroblast-like synoviocytes; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; MH7A, a kind of synovial cell; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; BMSC, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; HSkMC, human skeletal muscle myoblasts cell.

(p4.1) accelerated the degradation of chondrocyte matrix in joints, and inhibited cartilage to play a joint-protective role.The exosomal lncRNA NEAT1 has been implicated in the abnormal proliferation of FLSs and the inflammation of the synovium by different pathway mechanisms (Rao et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2021).The NF-κB signaling pathway is known as an important role in the pathogenesis of RA, and p-p65 is a common indicator of the NF-κB signaling pathway activity (Duan & Li, 2018).Rao et al. (2020) found that the exosomal NEAT1 derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is involved in the pathogenesis of RA through the NF-κB signaling pathway.By searching for differential lncRNAs, they found that the NEAT1 expression was significantly higher the healthy control group.Therefore, this lncRNA may be involved in the abnormal activation of FLSs.To further explore the role of NEAT1 in FLSs, they used bioinformatics software to analyze miR-23a and SIRT6.As downstream genes of NEAT1, these two had a synergistic effect on the pathogenesis of RA through the NF-κB signaling pathway.Meanwhile, they assessed the cell viability of FLSs and the content of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-a) and p-p65 in serum and found that the levels of the above indexes in the plasma of patients were all increased compared with those of the control group.In addition to human fibroblasts, they injected NEAT1-loaded exosomes in a mice model of RA and found the same result.This further supported their conclusion that the exosomal NEAT1 derived from PBMC may participate in the pathogenesis of RA and could potentially serve as a diagnostic marker in the future.
## (s6) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and exosomal lncRNA
(p6.0) SLE is a disease involving multiple organs and systems of the whole body.Its pathological basis is mainly vasculitis in the affected tissues, accompanied by abnormal inflammatory cell infiltration, immune complex deposition in the affected organs, etc.The pathogenesis is related to sex hormones, epigenetics, environmental factors, infection and many other factors (Tian et al., 2023).
## (s9) CONCLUSION
(p9.0) In this review, we summarized the research results of exosomal lncRNAs in some common rheumatic diseases.In addition, we also tried to summarize the research results on exosomal lncRNAs in other rheumatic diseases, such as polymyalgia rheumatica and ankylosing spondylitis.So far, there is no research in these fields.However, lncRNA has been found in these diseases; for example, lncRNA-NEF in ankylosing spondylitis has a role in evaluating treatment effect and predicting disease recurrence (Han et al., 2022).We will continue to follow new research development.

(p9.1) Although the research on exosomal lncRNAs have not been translated into results in the field of rheumatic diseases, the future is promising.In various studies on exosomal lncRNAs in rheumatic diseases, we can find various links in which exosomal lncRNAs with differential expression can participate.These new findings bring us to think that by detecting the levels of genes that are highly expressed in the body, such as the exosomal Hotair and NEAT1 in rheumatoid arthritis, it may be possible to help clinicians better diagnose the disease.Some research, such as exosomal PCGEM1, may fill the gap in the early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases.In addition, through in-depth study of the target genes and common pathways involved in the action of these genes, it was found that the occurrence of rheumatic diseases was caused by the abnormal activation of various immune pathways and the release of various inflammatory factors, which also provided a theoretical basis for our better understanding of diseases and targeted therapy of these pathways and inflammatory factors.
