## (s13) Kernel PCA enabled bit-string representation
(p13.0) Wong et al. [22] developed minutiae descriptor called Multi Line Code (MLC) which is used for fixed-length binary cancelable fingerprint template generation. An unordered and variable-size MLC template is transformed using kernel principal components analysis (KPCA) into an ordered and fixed-length bit-string. Some FVC datasets such as FVC2002DB1, FVC2002DB2, FVC2004DB1, FVC2004DB2 were used for the experiment and 1.61% was the obtained equal-error rate (EER) for the final bit string. Masquerade attack was possible in case of compromise of certain information required for KPCA.
