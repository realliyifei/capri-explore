## (s17) T-LoCoH
(p17.0) T-LoCoH (Lyons et al. 2013) generalizes the LoCoH home range to incorporate the observation times of the relocations.T-LoCoH incorporates the time associated to each location in two phases of the LoCoH algorithm: nearest neighbour selection and the ranking of hulls.First, the NN selection relies on the so-called time-scaled distance (TSD), which transforms the time coordinate into a third one of Euclidean space R 3 .Specifically, the TSD between two sample points, (t i , x i ) and (t j , x j ), is defined as

(p17.1) where s â‰¥ 0 is a scaling factor of the maximum theoretical velocity v max .Finally, to construct the isopleths, local hulls are sorted according to a hull metric, chosen to reflect the spatial or time information we might want to use.Dougherty et al. (2017) suggest a cross-validation procedure to select the tuning parameters k and s for the T-LoCoH.Following the indications in Lyons et al. (2013), with the aid of the graphical procedures available in the package tlocoh, we have chosen the values of s = 0.05 and k = 40 as T-LoCoH parameters for Zimzik locations.The value of v max was internally chosen by R. Figure 13 displays the resulting T-LoCoH home range.We notice that, in this case, there is not such a big difference between the LoCoH homerange (Figure 7) and the T-LoCoH one, probably due to the small value of the parameter s.
