## (s22) Tg, segmental dynamics
(p22.0) The typical finite size effects on segmental relaxation of polymers have been proposed to be i) the broadening of relaxation time distribution function, ii) the acceleration or deceleration of dynamics and iii) a different dependence of the relaxation time on the temperature. Nevertheless, dimensions of pores in AAO templates are likely to be far from the length-scales associated with the segmental dynamics [212]. Thus these kinds of pure finite size effects are hard to be observed in the AAO-polymer system. Instead, the adsorption of polymer chains on the hydroxilated pore walls of AAO templates seems to play mayor roll on the segmental dynamics -and thus on the T g -of polymers embedded in AAO templates. The dimensions of the AAO nanopores, however, come into conflict with the length scale of crystalline structures, which hence are altered in these pores. Consequently, indirect effects of pore confinement on segmental dynamics through structural changes might be a general feature of this system.
