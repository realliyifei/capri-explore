## (s29) Deplatforming
(p29.0) Deplatforming refers to the removal, ban or suspension of a user from a social media platform (Rogers, 2020). It can be seen as a de-facto boycotting of the person in question by removing their ability to contribute to the platform. While platforms routinely delete large volumes of user accounts, the intervention is also often associated with high-profile cases and as an intervention used only as a last resort, and in many cases as a reaction to public pressure, as platforms firmly stand-by their position of not interfering with free speech.

(p29.1) Moreover, it is not in their interest to remove these personalities with large followings who create viral content, due to the financial implications of doing so. In terms of platform adoption, another aspect to take into account is how platforms go about de-platforming.
