## (s12) ReTna → Lateral Geniculate thalamic Nucleus (LGN) → Primary Visual Cortex (V1)
(p12.0) The reIna has a higher density of photoreceptors in the fovea than in the periphery. This uneven distribuIon of photoreceptors results in a non-linear sampling of the visual input. Therefore, the image resoluIon is increased in the fovea and blurred towards the periphery. This, in turn, increases the Signal-to-Noise RaIo (SNR) of the input, which was proposed to increase robustness (Elsayed et al., 2018).
## (s19) Modeling Insights
(p19.0) Many models have proposed that adding biological components can improve robustness to adversarial aQacks. However, as we have seen in the last secIon, whether these aQempts were successful cannot easily be judged because o[en evaluaIon is hard to carry out. Here, we provide some useful insight gained from these studies and insights for future research direcIons.

(p19.1) Signal-to-noise raEo (SNR). It seems that S1 and S5 improve robustness by increasing the SNR, which is definitely a viable method. We suggest that this is the case because a high SNR may increase the relevant signals and discard the irrelevant signals (similar to Xie et al., 2019).
