## (s12) Mental health
(p12.0) The most evaluated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was on young people's mental health. However, studies were limited by cross-sectional study design, infrequent and inconsistent use of validated measures, and the reporting of various outcomes meant that comparison across studies was constrained. Despite these limitations, it is evident that young people are vulnerable to the onset of mental health conditions, and this may be exacerbated or accelerated due to COVID-19 (Fegert et al., 2020).
