(p3.0) [  (2011), compare in their research the removal of the smear layer using apical negative pressure (ANP) with the EndoVac device, manual dynamic agitation (MDA) and passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) using 2.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA as irrigating solutions, and according to the data obtained, EndoVac and MDA removed the smear layer better than PUI. A possible explanation for what happened was that both techniques reach full working length of the instrumented channels and, therefore, allow for adequate replacement of the irrigator, which is not possible or recommended with conventional needle irrigation devices or ultrasonic agitation. Ahuja et al. (2014) obtained similar results in their study, in which the EndoVac was more effective in removing smear layer followed by MDA and PUI, also using 2.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA as irrigators.
