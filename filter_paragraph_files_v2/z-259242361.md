## (s2) Cephalosporins
(p2.0) The β-lactam antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in many countries. Among these, cephalosporins are used to treat infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. Cephalosporins are classified as β-lactam antibiotics, originally derived from the fungus Cephalosporium sp., known today as Acremonium sp. [19].

(p2.1) They act in bacteria by binding to the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes located in the cytoplasmatic membrane that cross-link the peptidoglycan units, inhibiting the building of the cell wall and leading to cell death. Cephalosporins are used for the treatment of various infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They can be administered orally or parenterally, and are used in skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis, and infections caused by bacteria resistant to others antibiotics. So far, they are classified into five generations, according to their antibacterial spectrum of action and their temporal release.
