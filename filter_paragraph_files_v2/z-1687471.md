## (s12) Mid-Level Vision Tasks
(p12.0) Normally, the input for a mid-level algorithm is an image processed in a low-level task. Information delivered at this stage corresponds to features of the image itself or of the objects contained in the image. Examples of these are estimation of blobs position, magnification, orientation, corner or edge detection [8], or region labeling.
