## (s2) Antimalarial compounds with thiadiazole substituent
(p2.0) The current antimalarial drugs have different mode of actions (30). 4-aminoquinoline (CQ and AQ) and aryl-amino alcohol drugs (MQ and HAL) inhibit the heme polymerization. Artemisinin and its derivatives also interact with heme or iron by their endoperoxide bond. While, the antifolate drugs inhibit either dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) (sulfadoxine) or dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (cycloguanil, pyrimethamine). Today, drugs resistant variants showed reduced affinity toward antimalarial drugs. Actually, drug resistance is considered as an important global health problem in malaria prophylaxis and treatment. In this situation, the development of new, cheap, efficient, and safe drugs for the treatment of this disease is imperative.
