## (s6) Coalescence of Drops on a Deformable Surface
(p6.0) Drops can behave differently on a deformable or soft substrate.For instance, when a drop is placed on a soft, deformable substrate, the surface tension along the contact line deforms the substrate [32].Similarly, when drops merge on a deformable substrate, which is usually a liquid, the deformation and energy dissipation of the substrate influence the coalescence.Thus, drop coalescence on a deformable surface can be regarded as a special case of the three-phase drop coalescence on one confining surface.This section summarizes the coalescence of two types of drops on a liquid substrate: flat disks and liquid lenses.
