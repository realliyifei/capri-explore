## (s1) Methodological Quality and Level of Evidence Assessment
(p1.0) The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated independently by two authors using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) (Shea et al., 2017), and a third author assisted in the judgement in cases of disagreement. The methodological quality of AMSTAR2 for systematic review is divided into 16 entries, among which item 2, item 4, item 7, item 9, item 10, item 11, item 13 and item 15 are recommended critical items for determine methodological quality. Considering the specificity of TCM research, we made the following adjustments to the key items. Since some systematic reviews were published before the establishment of the registration platform and the registration platform does not have a Chinese registration language, it was difficult to obtain the protocols of these previous Chinese systematic reviews, so we did not include item 2 as a key entry. Chinese medicine research is mainly published in Chinese language, and most Chinese journal submission systems do not support the presentation of a list of excluded studies, so item 7 was not considered a key entry.

(p1.1) The final evaluation results were classified as 1) "high quality" when there was no or one non-critical weakness, 2) "medium quality" when there was more than one non-critical weakness, 3) "low quality" when there was one critical flaw with or without non-critical weaknesses, or 4) "very low quality" when there was more than one critical flaw with or without non-critical weaknesses.
