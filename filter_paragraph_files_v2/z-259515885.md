## (s7) PREPARATION METHODS OF HYDROGELS
(p7.0) Polymer networks made from natural or manmade polymers make up hydrogels. Chemical crosslinking, physical cross-linking, grafting polymerization, and radiation cross-linking are some of the preparation methods employed [31]. The next sections explain how to prepare hydrogels in general.
## (s12) CROSS-LINKING BY CHEMICAL MEANS
(p12.0) This method includes grafting the monomers onto polymer chains or binding two polymer chains together with a cross-linking agent. The reaction between functional groups like NH2, COOH, and OH with cross-linking agents that can be aldehyde causes cross-linking of synthetic and natural polymers. Hydrogels which are cross-linked chemically can be produced in a variety of ways. Crosslinking via complimentary groups chemical reactions, crosslinking with free radical polymerization, and crosslinking with enzymes are the three most common chemical processes [36].
## (s13) COMPLIMENTARY GROUP CROSS-LINKING REACTION
(p13.0) Polymers which contain hydrophilic groups like NH2, COOH, and OH can be utilized in preparing hydrogels. Isocyanate-OH/NH2 reactions, amine-carboxylic acid reactions, and Schiff base production are all examples of reactions that can be utilized to understand covalent connections among the chains of polymers [36].
