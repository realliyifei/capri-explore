## (s19) Qualitative Analysis
(p19.0) For qualitative analysis, research based on image features for grapes is rare here. Grape grading is a vital sector in commercial production, and fine grading and exquisite packaging could effectively improve the value of goods. Image features are often used in qualitative analysis, such as identifying grape grades. Based on the image feature, Xiao et al. measured values of SSC, TP and color space CIELAB. Three classes (Class I, Class II, Class III) were established only by the values of SSC and TP due to poor correlation between CIELAB and spectral data. PLS-DA was built using VIS/NIR Spectroscopy data to identify four different grades of grape, and the accuracy was 77%-94% [51]. This study result is consistent with the previous literature because it is difficult to classify and evaluate grapes only by image features.
