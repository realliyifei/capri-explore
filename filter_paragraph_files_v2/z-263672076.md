## (s1) Our Contributions
(p1.0) The contribution of this paper are mainly three-fold.(1) We present a systematic and comprehensive review of recent advancements in single image deraining field.(2) We construct a new high-quality image deraining banchmark (called HQ-RAIN) to inspire further researches for more robust algorithms.(3) We provide an online platform to offer a fair and unified performance evaluation for deep image deraining methods.
## (s8) Depth-guided Rain Model (DRM).
(p8.0) where F ∈ [0, 1] represents the fog layer.F is further written as F = 1 − e −βd(x) , where β determines the thickness of fog, and d(x) denotes the scene depth.

(p8.1) Transmission Medium Model (TMM).Based on the observation that rain streaks and vapors are entangled with each other, Wang et al. [26] remodel rain imaging by formulating both rain streaks and vapors as transmission medium, which is formulated as:
## (s25) Model Efficiency. Model efficiency is critical driver for the practical application of deep image deraining algorithms.
(p25.0) The evaluation metrics for model efficiency typically include the numbers of parameters (#Params), inference running time, and Floating Point Operations (FLOPs).It is widely known that a shorter running time and a smaller #Params and FLOPs means better model efficiency.

(p25.1) Application-based Evaluations.One of the goals of image deraining, in addition to enhancing the visual quality, is to serve high-level vision tasks, such as object recognition [123] and segmentation [124].Thus, to verify the performance of different methods, the effects of image deraining on outdoor vision based applications are further investigated.
## (s32) Track Establishment and Evaluated Methods
(p32.0) For a comprehensive performance evaluation, we first select previously representative benchmarks to participate in our survey.Faced with dozens of existing benchmarks, it is not rare that we feel confused about which dataset to choose for the experiment at hand.In fact, our goal is to enable models to learn better generalization from representative datasets.To this end, we perform cross-domain generalizability validation on the commonly used datasets using  [20].Table 4 shows that methods trained on the Rain13K [18] generalizes to an unseen samples well, due to the data diversity.In addition, a single dataset can also achieve the best results in certain specific scenarios, such as DDN-Data → RainDS-Real-RS.In other words, mixed datasets have advantages in comprehensive deraining performance, while single dataset has advantages in image-specific (e.g., heavy rain) deraining performance.
## (s36) Computational Complexity
(p36.0) The computational complexity is also one of the important factor for image deaining methods.Table 7 shows the computational complexity of different methods, including trainable model parameters, FLOPs and running time on a 256 × 256 image.LPNet [52] requires lower computational complexity as it develops a lightweight pyramid network using domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process.In contrast, the model size of HINet [134] is extremely large, reaching 88.67M, which limits its usage  in practical applications.The FLOPs of DRSformer [9] is relatively higher as it involves the computation of the topk self-attention.For inference time, most existing methods, especially Transformer-based approaches, are not efficient.Thus, how to develop efficient yet effective method is still worthy investigation.
