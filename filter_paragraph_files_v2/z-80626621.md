## (s6) Stem Cell-Based Therapy for Treatment of LSCD
(p6.0) The choice of treatment and rate of success for patients with LSCD depends on several factors, including the cause of the condition, size of the limbal injury (partial or total), number of eyes affected (unilateral or bilateral), and status of adjacent tissues (conjunctiva and eyelid). The ocular surface must also be prepared before treatment. Treatment options thus range from scraping off conjunctival epithelium covering the corneal surface in the case of early-stage partial LSCD to combining this mechanical debridement with stem cell-based therapy for total LSCD [71].
