## (s13) Health-Care Applications
(p13.0) Smart health-care services result in the creation of applications, so that clients and patients can correctly use the applications [46]. Table 3 presents different Internet of Things (IoT) based health-care applications.
## (s24) Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) and 3D MIMO
(p24.0) According to Shannon's theorem for the capacity of a network, the upper limit to the capacity of a communication link in bps is fixed, and this rule might be used for investigation on achieving superior data rates [65].
## (s35) Achieving Interoperability
(p35.0) Interoperability is a capability to interconnect two or more than two different devices and networks for data exchange. The smart health-care network consists of various IoT devices with different domains (i.e., remote health monitoring, remote surgery, and ECG). Interoperability performs a significant role by providing a platform of connectivity to various devices with different communication technologies. However, due to a lack of universal standards communications technologies, the interoperability between multiple domains is a significant hurdle for IoT success [79]. Therefore, a critical intelligent approach is required to check interoperability at different levels and allow for millions of devices in the network to communicate with each other. Different organisations, like oneM2M and FIWARE, are working in collaboration with various standardisations, like ETSI, OMA, and 3GPP, to sort out the interoperability issue.
