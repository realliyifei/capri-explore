## (s6) Impulse Breakdown Strength
(p6.0) The dispersion of semiconductive nanoparticles effectively changes the scattering of space charge caused     by shallow traps and thus modifies the appearances of streamer transmission and interruption. At the head of streamer during positive polarity, the electrical field is distorted extensively due to induced negative charges that delay the propagation of streamer whereas it speeds up when negative impulse is applied. Wang et al. 27 deliberated the effect of three dissimilar nanoparticles on impulse breakdown strength at different concentrations. Figures 16 and 17 shows the result of failure at applied impulse voltage as a function of size percentage for three dissimilar nanoparticles.

(p6.1) The dielectric strength improves due to the alteration of space charge activity until the critical value of concentration is achieved. The nanoparticles with greater volume in transformer oil can lead to the evolution of the clusters and hence diminish the breakdown voltage.
