## (s5) Obesity
(p5.0) The association of BMI with hypertension has been reported in multiple studies, specifically a BMI greater than 23 kg/m 2 [28]. Akram J et al. noted obesity prevalence in Pakistan was 70% and had significant association with hypertension (HTN) (p = 0.0003) [29]. They also found obesity was higher among Pakistani women than men. The childhood obesity epidemic has caused the global prevalence of (HTN) in children to increase from 2 to 4% [21]. However, there is limited data on obese children and HTN in Pakistan.
## (s10) Challenges in controlling hypertension
(p10.0) The nonexistence of screening programs, problems in accessing health care facilities, lack of communication between provider and patient, and high treatment costs are substantial barriers to the hypertension control in Pakistan [53]. A qualitative study conducted at Aga Khan Hospital, Karachi, found that lack of insight about disease seriousness, deficiency in knowledge, health care system limitations, inadequate health education, financial constraints, religious belief, all acted as barriers to proper control of NCDs including hypertension [54]. In contrast, patients with higher education levels, family history of HTN, fear of premature death, and previous comorbidities were more likely to perform self-care behavior than newly diagnosed patients [54].
