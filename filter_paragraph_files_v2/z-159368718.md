## (s7) Photocatalysis Based on Silicomanganese Slag
(p7.0) Compared to the former three materials, silicomanganese slag is produced in much lower volumes. Two interesting catalyst applications have been developed for this waste product. Zhang et al. used thermoalkalic activation in the presence of carbon black, the latter to improve the electron transport in the product. Basic violet 5BN dye was successfully degraded by the resulting product [88].
