## (s3) Graph Families
(p3.0) The beyond-planar graph families considered in this survey are defined as graphs that admit drawings not containing specific forbidden configurations, that is, sets of edges that violate some desired topological or geometric property of the edge crossings. Table 1 provides a schematic illustration of some beyond-planar graph families, among the most studied in the literature. For each family X, we define what a drawing of type X is. A graph belongs to family X if it admits a drawing of type X. Definitions based on first-order logic formulas have been recently proposed for many of these types of drawings [58].
