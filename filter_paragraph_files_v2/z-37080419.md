## (s1) Data Collection and Methodology
(p1.0) The Web of science (WOS) is the most widespread database on different scientific fields which is frequently used for searching the statistical data regarding scientific literature [46].WOS includes over 1.2 × 10 4 journals worldwide, 1.5 × 10 5 conference proceedings and 2.75 × 10 5 books and book chapters.WOS citation databases are Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded from 1998 to present), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI from 1993 to present), Arts and Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI from 1993 to present), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Sciences and Humanities (CPCI-SSH), and the two chemistry databases named Index Chemicus (IC) and Current Chemical Reactions (CCR-Expanded).For these reasons in this paper the WOS database was used to collect the articles related to the field of "Chemistry".The search was confined to the scholarly communications from 1993 to 2012 indexed by Thomson Reuthers' WOS, and was performed from 1 to 10 January 2014.
