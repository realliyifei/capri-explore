## (s28) Perspectives
(p28.0) We have developed partly the concept of finite-temperature form factor in the general context of factorised scattering theory, and we completed the program in the case of the Majorana theory. The most important next step is, of course, to complete this program in models with non-trivial scattering. We believe that ideas concerning the relation between finite-temperature form factors and matrix elements in the quantization on the circle will lead to restrictive conditions that will greatly help fully fix finite-temperature form factors in interacting models. Also, the operator implementing the generalisation of CFT's "mapping to the cylinder" may be useful, and this method is not far from the explicit construction of "boundary-creating operator" in integrable boundary QFT. The generalisation to interacting models is a very important step, and will open the way to results about large-distance and large-time behaviours of correlation functions in interacting, integrable models. Another interesting avenue is to generalise the program to the free Dirac theory; this should not pose any difficulties, and will clarify the structure of finite-temperature form factors of more general twist fields (two-point functions at finite-temperature were already studied in [49]). Then, it would be interesting to understand the structure for descendants of twist fields in such free fermionic models, perhaps using the operator Ω defined in (6.7) that provides a "mapping to the cylinder".
