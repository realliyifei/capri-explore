(p14.0) Observational prospective study 6 MCO-HD vs hf-HD vs pre-HDF Clearance of larger middle molecules MCO-HD showed significantly greater clearance of large medium molecules and achieved better clearance of and kappa and lambda free light chain than hf-HD and HDF, without the need for large convection volumes or high blood flow rates. MCO-HD presents an advantage for older adult patients with vascular access deficiencies and HD patients without access to HDF.
