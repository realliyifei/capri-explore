## (s2) Method
(p2.0) This study used the PRISMA process to investigate previous studies.Following the PRISMA guidelines, this study specifies a minimum number of items to be reported, and assesses the effectiveness of interventions of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.This method improves the transparency, rigor and credibility of this study [34].
## (s9) 3) Discipline analysis
(p9.0) The digital preservation of architectural heritage is a multidisciplinary and comprehensive research field that covers various topics.According to Fig. 5, the main disciplines involved in this field are Geoscience, Materials Science, and Environmental Science.

(p9.1) This implies that to protect architectural heritage from disasters, it is necessary to: (1) apply knowledge and methods from earth science, material science, and environmental science to analyze the geographical location, structural characteristics, and environmental impacts of    and selected 42 keywords with a minimum frequency of 13 to generate a keyword clustering map with 42 nodes, 477 links, and a total link strength of 1341.Among them, the co-occurrence frequency indicates the association between keywords, and the modularity optimization and smart local moving algorithms so as to assign keywords to different topics that then optimize the network layout.The color and size of the nodes are determined by the keywords, and the lines represent the distance and connection strength between the nodes, showing the relationships, differences, and development trends among different topics, as shown in Fig. 6 [40].According to the keyword clustering, four topics are identified: Model, Cultural heritage, Management, and Buildings.These keywords represent different aspects of architectural heritage conservation, such as disaster analysis, spatial modeling, data management, and heritage conservation.Cluster 1 (red) uses the keyword "Model", which discusses the impact of disaster types on architectural heritage and the application of corresponding DTech.Cluster 2 (green) uses the keyword "Cultural heritage", which focuses on architectural heritage as the core object and explores spatial models, data management, and reality technologies.Cluster 3 (blue) uses the keyword "Management", which is oriented towards information systems and related aspects, and studies the protection management of architectural heritage.Cluster 4 (yellow) utilizes the keyword "Buildings", which uses types of architectural heritage as the scale range and discusses the role of DTech in architectural heritage conservation and restoration.From an overall perspective of the clusters, the most frequent keywords are mainly related to architectural heritage and digitalization, among which "Cultural Heritage" ranks highest, with a frequency of 130 times and a total link strength of 236 times.This suggests that architectural heritage is the main theme, and covers aspects such as disasters, DTech, management, etc.Moreover, DTech runs through the whole process of architectural heritage conservation and is therefore an important core technology.
