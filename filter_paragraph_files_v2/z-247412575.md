## (s6) Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias
(p6.0) The quality and risk of bias critical appraisals of included studies were assessed independently with conflicts resolved through discussion by three researchers on the basis of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs (31). The Cochrane Collaboration's tool provides seven quality domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. Funnel plots were used to investigate publication bias.
