## (s7) Heat-Free Bonding
(p7.0) Stable undercooled liquid nano-and/or micro-particles have been considered for use as a low temperature solder [69]. Since Ga and some of its alloys are liquid near or at room temperature and exhibit significant undercooling on solidification, a few attempts have been made to eliminate the heat required in conventional soldering.
