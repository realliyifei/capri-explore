## (s4) Lunar Antenna Types
(p4.0) Within this section, we offer a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of antennas employed in lunar applications.Our diligent efforts to conduct a thorough literature review are evident, despite the challenges posed by the limited availability of articles concerning lunar antennas.These antennas are classified into planar antennas, reflector antennas, low-frequency antennas, and wire antennas.Additionally, considering their applications, these antennas are further divided into two sub-categories: mission-oriented antennas, utilized in active lunar missions, and research-focused antennas, exclusively employed for academic investigations.Our objective is to furnish a comprehensive synthesis of the encountered antennas, organized by their respective types.Antennas de- For a considerable duration, space scientists have extensively examined the challenges of lunar communication, recognizing their substantial impact on wireless communication such as harsh temperatures between 100 • C and −173 • C, depending on the landing sites, intensive solar radiation, the interference of lunar dust with hardware, long-distance communications with Earth stations, the importance of line-of-sight (LOS) requirements, signal propagation delays, and antenna orientation to keep a strong signal connection, including the data rate and power transmission that must comply with international regulations.These challenges possess the capability to both enhance and degrade the quality of signal transmission, in which the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) values in lunar communications can vary significantly based on specific mission parameters, hardware, frequencies used, and environmental conditions.The SNR values for a particular lunar communication link can be determined through link budget analysis, which considers the full range of system parameters and environmental factors to ensure reliable communication in lunar missions [42].
## (s17) Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antennas (LGWAs)
(p17.0) The Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA) project aims to create a lunar network to monitor gravitational wave-induced vibrations, paving the way for groundbreaking scientific exploration on the moon.By observing gravitational waves in the decihertz range, LGWA enhances our cosmic understanding and requires advanced components, including cryogenic sensors and noise-cancellation arrays, to minimize interference.Multiple stations with LGWA-grade arrays are crucial for effective noise reduction and local data analysis on the moon [27].
## (s25) Discussion
(p25.0) In recent times, the moon has emerged as a focal point of technological research and development, particularly in the realms of in situ resource utilization, human exploration and habitation, and its potential role as a staging point for human missions to Mars [87].NASA's Artemis program is poised to establish a sustained presence on the lunar surface, ushering in an era of more extensive lunar exploration than ever before.This burgeoning lunar activity necessitates the development of advanced communication, navigation, and networking capabilities, and LUNANET stands as a prime example of meeting this demand.Notably, the United States, China, and India have already solidified their positions in lunar exploration, with several other nations, including the United Arab Emirates, declaring their intentions to embark on lunar missions in the near future.The moon, distinct from Earth, lacks an atmosphere, underscoring the importance of comprehending its surface and associated challenges.These missions serve as a source of national pride and demand substantial financial investments, emphasizing the significance of a thorough understanding of the lunar environment prior to their initiation.Moreover, lunar communication networks are not yet as established as their terrestrial counterparts.As noted in Section 2, researchers are actively engaged in the ongoing development of accurate propagation models.It is paramount to meticulously design and test the systems in such environments to ensure error-free operations, taking into account the limited optimization opportunities once the systems are deployed on the lunar surface.As elucidated in Section 3, lunar communication presents a multitude of challenges.Antennas, serving as pivotal components within the communication system, function as sensors for the entire network.Therefore, the stability of these antennas, both electrically and mechanically, is of the utmost importance.Conducting electromagnetic simulations is a fundamental step in this regard.As summarized in Section 4, lunar antennas possess many unique characteristics.Lightweight antennas with superior performance hold significant relevance in this context.Mission-specific antennas may necessitate additional coatings or special materials to withstand the extreme temperature conditions experienced on the lunar surface.The antennas discussed in the review article commonly serve dual roles, operating as both transmitters and receivers.This dual functionality is a prevalent feature in space communication systems, enabling bidirectional communication.It is vital to understand that the power capacity and data rate of antennas used in lunar missions vary significantly based on the specific mission's objectives and capabilities.Larger lunar rovers and assets, equipped with high-power and fast communication systems, may necessitate antennas capable of handling higher power levels and faster data rates.Conversely, smaller lunar assets and rovers, constrained by size and power limitations, may opt for lower-speed and lower-power antennas.The choice behavior in the lunar environment and developing models for the corresponding propagation channel in preparation for the upcoming Rashid rover mission.These findings will not only advance our understanding of lunar antenna systems but also play a vital role in optimizing the selection and placement of antennas for future missions, including the Emirates Lunar Mission (ELM).
