(p4.0) Vosviewer software that was created and explained by Van Eck and Waltman [10] was used to analyze the final data, to see the distribution of data patterns. VOSviewer shows, there are 2342 terms words that appear more than once in the title and abstract. Then the vosviewer analyzes the words, which appear above 10 times, in the 78 titles and abstracts of the papers and found 48 threshold. If we want more rigid results, we can change this amount. We can replace it with a larger number, 15 or 20 times. Figure 4 shows density visualisation mapping from VOSViewer. The red colors presentes the largest number of items and the highest weights of elements, followed by yellow and green ones. The red colors means that these words, such as 'practice', 'model', 'process', 'performance', ' industry' are widely used by researchers. Our consideration is in the words inside green colours, such as 'energy', and ' environmental regulation'. In the middle between red and green colours, is yellow colours. The words such as 'adoption', 'survey', 'gscm', 'smes', 'cost', gives researchers an opportunity to be further investigated. Researchers can conduct future research on research topics based on these words inside green and yellow colour of density visualisation mapping.
