## (s11) Environmental Properties
(p11.0) Long-term performance of MSWI ash fine aggregates exceed the limit for concrete application: the leaching of Pb and Zn increased in MSWI ash concretes, with high concentration caused by the high pH environment.

(p11.1) Leaching test conducted on concrete samples made with MSWI ash fine aggregates has reported values lower than the untreated wastes for a series of pollutants, clearly confirming the effectiveness of the concrete stabilization. The leaching of Cu has been reduced, but on the other hand, leaching of Pb and Zn from the concretes containing wastes were in general higher than from the single waste. The concentrations of Cu and Pb exceeded the respective limit values. However, the lower levels of some elements from the mortar are due to chemical processes occurring during cement hydration. The high pH environment, instead, causes the high concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn [71].
