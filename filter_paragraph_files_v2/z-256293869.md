## (s13) Immobilization techniques
(p13.0) There are five major techniques employed in immobilization of laccase namely, physical adsorption, entrapment, encapsulation, covalent bonding, and crosslinking ( Figure 6). The techniques are classified as physical (entrapment, encapsulation and adsorption) and chemical (covalent and crosslinking). These methods vary in cost and ease of preparation, stability, catalytic efficiency, and physical properties of the resultant biocatalyst [401]. The different immobilization techniques with their advantages and disadvantages as well as the type and strength of interaction between enzyme and support for each technique have been summarized in Table 2.
