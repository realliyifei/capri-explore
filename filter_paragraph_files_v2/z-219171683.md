(p11.0) Report quality of included reviews. We will also use Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses Statement (PRISMA) checklist [32] to assess the report quality of the included reviews by tabulating whether the following items have been adequately addressed. It is 1 point for the content of the item, 0.5 point for the part, and 0 point if the systematic review does not match the entry. The total score â‰¥22 is "high quality", 11 to 21 is classified as "moderate quality", and 10 is classified as "low quality" ( Table 2).
