## (s6) Transport set
(p6.0) The following setting is fixed once for all: (X, d, m) is a fixed metric measure space with m(X) = 1 such that the ambient metric space (X, d) is geodesic and proper (hence complete and separable).

(p6.1) Let ϕ : X → R be any 1-Lipschitz function. Here we present some useful results (all of them already presented in [11]) concerning the d-cyclically monotone set associated with ϕ:

(p6.2) that can be seen as the set of couples moved by ϕ with maximal slope. Recall that a set Λ ⊂ X × X is said to be d-cyclically monotone if for any finite set of points (
## (s11) Balanced transportation.
(p11.0) Here we want underline that the disintegration (or one-dimensional localization) of m induced by the L 1 -Optimal Transportation problem between µ 0 and µ 1 is actually a localization of the Monge problem. We will present this fact considering a function f :

(p11.1) and considering µ 0 := f + m and µ 1 := f − m, where f ± denotes the positive and the negative part of f . We can also assume µ 0 , µ 1 ∈ P(X) and study the Monge minimization problem between µ 0 and µ 1 . This setting is equivalent to study the general Monge problem assuming both µ 0 , µ 1 ≪ m; note indeed that µ 0 and µ 1 can always be assumed to be concentrated on disjoint sets (see [11] for details).
