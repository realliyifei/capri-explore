## (s4) The Area in which the Perception of the TGI Originates
(p4.0) Ferrè et al. evaluated whether the perception of the TGI originates at the spinal or supraspinal levels. The inhibition of nociceptive input by concomitant non-nociceptive somatosensory input is known to have a strong spinal component [13]. For this reason, they proposed that if the afferent input underlying the TGI originates at the spinal level, then the TGI is inhibited by a concomitant non-nociceptive somatosensory input (tactile stimulation). By contrast, if the TGI is provoked by the supraspinal process, a concomitant tactile stimulation would not affect the TGI. To remove the effect of touch on the TGI, instead of the conventional TGI based on mechanical contact between the skin and hot and cold bars, the authors applied a novel radiant thermal stimulation. In their study, TGI was not influenced by the presence of tactile stimulation. They concluded that TGI-induced pain would result from supraspinal interactions. However, because Ferrè et al. did not demonstrate that tactile stimulation applied in their study could inhibit nociceptive input, the conclusion might not be robust.
