## (s20) Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
(p20.0) A practical decision scenario usually has a large state space and large action space. It is difficult for conventional RL to model such complex environment. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) use the deep learning to better represent environment and actions. The architecture of DRL with Q-learning, which is a typical example of DRL, is shown in Fig. 7 (b). Deep Q-networks, such as CNN and RNN, are introduced to replace the Q-table in conventional RL to achieve better abstraction of the environment states, and learn the expectation values of each decision. The environment feeds the deep Q-network with observed state and corresponding action award for the network training [50].
