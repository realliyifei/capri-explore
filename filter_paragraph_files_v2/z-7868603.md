## (s19) Inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Factor-a
(p19.0) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

## (s24) Certolizumab Pegol
(p24.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.

The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

(p151.1) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3).

## (s156) Certolizumab Pegol
(p156.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.
