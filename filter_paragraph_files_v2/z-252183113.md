## (s4) L. fermentum LLB3
(p4.0) An experimental study revealed that treatment with L. fermentum LLB3 isolated from the bamboo shoot pickle and offered in fermented bitter melon (Momordica charantia), in a concentration of 1 Ã— 10 7 CFU during 4 wk, reduced fasting glucose and postprandial blood glucose levels and increased SOD enzyme activity in rats subjected to type 2 DM induced by streptozotocin (STZ) [50]. This suggests that L. fermentum LLB3 might be considered an adjuvant therapy to attenuate type 2 DM-related symptoms [50].
