## (s13) Isolation using agar
(p13.0) It is probably the oldest and standard method available to isolate microorganisms. Most of the diatom species usually grow well in agar. Isolation using agar can be used with both "streaking" and "spreading" methods. Later single cells or colonies can be picked from the culture plate and observed under the microscope. To study the colony/diatom community characteristics, agar plate method is advantageous. The agar concentration should be between 0.8% to 1.5% and 2.0%. While observing glass slide under a microscope, if it contains a single diatom cell, it can be replicated on the agar plate for culture. Agar pour plate method can also be used to isolate cells that do not grow on the surface of the agar plate [78].
## (s16) Membrane filtration
(p16.0) This is a pre-isolation step towards the separation of diatoms. Samples can break into two portions depend upon particle size difference. Sometimes enrichment media can also be utilized for better outcomes while separating fungal cells from diatoms. Bigger species can be held at the membrane however, diatom cells pass through the filter quickly. This strategy is helpful, advantageous, and very adaptable [81].
