## (s6) Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (MTHFD) Maintains NADP/NADPH Pools in Cancer
(p6.0) MTHFD2 is an enzyme that is required for tumor cell survival [104]. MTHFD2 is highly expressed in the mitochondria and nucleus of multiple types of tumor cells, but not in non-transformed cells [104]. The only non-transformed cell induction of MTHFD2 was observed in lymphocyte activation, indicating the role of MTHFD2 in normal hematopoietic cells as well as in the tumorigenesis process of hematologic malignancies [105].
