## (s16) Experimental setup
(p16.0) The participant is setup in the ACT 3D as described in the experimental setup paragraph of the maximum abduction torque method above with the addition of a custom cylindrical force sensor and 3D motion analysis markers for measuring hand opening and closing respectively (Fig. 6). The hand mount and forearm orthosis Fig. 6 Hand mounted to the cylindrical force mat with motion analysis markers in place. Forearm is securely mounted to the ACT 3D for the manipulation of abduction loading during reaching movement are rigidly attached to the ACT 3D . The pressure sensor mat (Pressure Profile System Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA) allows real-time pressure measurement under the digits during hand grasping. Infrared light-emitting diode markers allow kinematic data to be collected using two Optotrak camera systems (Optotrak 3020 and Certus, Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada) from all digits during hand opening. Alternatively, assessment of hand kinematics may also be measured using inertial and magnetic sensors [33].
