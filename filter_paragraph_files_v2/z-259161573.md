## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) To control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many governments began implementing containment measures in the hopes of limiting the spread of the virus, reducing the burdens on healthcare systems, and minimizing the death toll.Although some countries (like Sweden) turned toward a more laissez-faire herd immunity approach, others adopted containment measures, known as nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).Unlike pharmaceutical interventions, such as medication and vaccination, 1 NPIs aim at limiting mobility and reducing contact to mitigate the severity of a virus' impact; these range from measures that seek to curb transmissions (i.e., closing of public spaces, gathering bans, masking requirements) to stricter mandates that impose restrictions on personal liberties (i.e., shelter-inplace orders [SIPOs], curfews).

(p0.1) During the first wave (January 2020−June 2020), the unprecedented rapid spread of COVID-19 sparked varied responses from around the world-each country was reacting in a way that they believed to be most effective.Still, there is much debate as to which NPIs are most impactful in mitigating the COVID-19 burden on related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.This information can be extremely valuable to policy makers and government officials facing future waves of the pandemic and other viral outbreaks.

(p0.2) One literature review by Herby and colleagues 2 sought to address these issues by analyzing the effects of various NPIs on mortality during the first wave, ultimately concluding that they are not an effective way of reducing mortality rates during a pandemic.Although this may be the case, the authors looked to extend their research by including 2 additional variables that may have influenced the government responses: cases and hospitalizations.Although deaths are the most extreme of the 3 variables, infections and hospital capacities were being monitored throughout the pandemic, and their progression following the imposed measures should not be overlooked.Mendez-Brito and colleagues 3 studied the association between 15 NPIs and COVID-19 health outcomes; however, their analyses used the proportion of papers that found these measures to be mitigative, rather than the proportion of cases, hospitalizations, or deaths averted.Ge et al. 4 studied the effects of various NPIs on transmission across waves.As time went on, governments and the public became more experienced in transmission mitigation, therefore their paper may have captured some behavioral aspects that cannot be fully attributed to the NPIs themselves.In their review, Patiño-Lugo and colleagues 5 studied the roles of various NPIs containing the virus, and although they did acknowledge cases, mortality, and the hospital burden, they did not quantify how effective NPIs were in mitigating these outcomes.Estimating the effects of NPIs does present some challenges: the literature differs not only in the methodology used, but also in the way that effectiveness is reported, making it difficult to compare findings across studies.In contrast to Herby et al., 2 who converted findings from the literature into common percentage estimates, this review grouped studies by the metrics used for reporting to compare like results.This allowed the review to consider articles that were excluded from that of Herby and colleagues, 2 namely those studying growth rates and per capita effects.

(p0.3) In this paper, the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effects of 10 NPIs on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and mortality (Table 1) to determine which measures were most effective in mitigating the pandemic's burden on health outcomes during the first wave.This research extends the previous literature by analyzing these output variables across 3 reporting metrics (cumulative, growth rate, and per capita effects) at 3 points in time (2, 3, and ≥4 weeks after NPI implementation).In none of the reviews the authors consulted considered time lags.Relevant articles were obtained through an extensive search and selective screening process that refined the sample to just qualified papers.Once complete, the articles were assessed individually, and the estimated effects of NPIs were collected from the available material.
## (s4) Estimating the Effects of NPIs
(p4.0) Following the screening process, the 82 included studies were then reviewed for inclusion in the meta-analysis by 2 researchers.The articles were coded in a spreadsheet where outputs, containment measures, periods of study, methodologies, data sources, study regions, and levels of analyses were reported (Appendix Table 1, available online).Throughout the revision, 38 studies were identified that did not provide usable estimates.Although the authors might have been expected to exclude these in the previous step, their ineligibility was not apparent simply from reading the abstracts.The authors were less restrictive during the screening process to capture as many qualified articles as possible.

(p4.1) Estimates for the 44 papers included in the meta-analysis were obtained from various tables and figures.The authors studied the outputs across 10 NPIs that were divided into 2 groups for analysis (Table 1): collective and specific measures.Collective measures consisted of NPIs overall and government stringency.Overall NPIs comprised papers studying country-specific responses (like South Africa's Level 5 lockdown 16 ) and grouped NPIs for measuring a collective effect, whereas government stringency referred to those using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) index.The authors also looked at papers focusing on the isolated effects of ≥1 of the 8 specific NPIs: SIPOs, social distancing, mask use, limited gatherings, non-essential business closures, bar/restaurant closures, school closures, and travel restrictions/border closures.

(p4.2) Because each paper took a different approach in reporting NPI effectiveness, we compared studies across 3 reporting metrics: cumulative, growth rate, and per capita effects.The former 2 were presented as percentages; however, the authors sought to distinguish between those expressed in terms of total change and those expressed as changes in daily growth rates.Per capita effects-the number of new cases, hospitalizations, or deaths per 100,000 population-were the preferred metric in these analyses.Unlike percentages (which are relative), per capita effects conform to a universal standard that is consistent across studies and is independent of the population.

(p4.3) To compare the timely effects of NPIs, the authors reported their estimates across lag periods of 2, 3, and ≥4 weeks since implementation.In accordance with previous research, 17 the authors decided not to include a 1week lag because the effects of containment measures are most often noticeable 2 weeks after implementation.It should also be noted that, if a study did not report their results for 14, 21, or 28 days, the estimate that most closely aligned with the specified lag periods were taken.

(p4.4) To address risk of bias in this selection of articles, the authors employed the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, in which 1 reviewer performed risk of bias assessments and a second reviewer verified all assessments.
## (s9) Impact on Mortality
(p9.0) Collective NPIs.Although NPIs overall and policy stringency were associated with reduced cases, they did not have the same effect on mortality.Of the 7 studies reporting effects of response stringency on per capita mortality, only 1 (Chisadza et al., 45 also a fair quality paper) linked stricter policies to more deaths, but the 95% CIs included 0, suggesting insignificance.On the other hand, after 4 weeks, stricter policies were associated with 0.04% reductions in mortality rates.

(p9.1) Specific NPIs.Of the 6 NPIs studied in per capita mortality, bar/restaurant closures experienced the largest effects 4 weeks after implementation, corresponding to 1.08 fewer deaths per 100,000.Although we did not find any more evidence of fewer deaths per capita, limited gatherings (−6.41%), business (−5.32%)and school closures (−3.98%) were associated with decreased mortality growth rates after 2 weeks, whereas SIPOs (−1.66%), masks (−1.9%), and school closures (−8.29%) corresponded to reductions after 3 weeks.SIPOs were the only NPI studied at the ≥4-week lag for growth rates and were associated with a 1.95% drop in the mortality rates.Although the authors observed mitigative effects of travel restrictions on case growth rates, this was not the case for mortality.
## (s10) DISCUSSION
(p10.0) Because of the manuscript limitations, only 4 tables/figures are presented; however, other related materials of the review can be accessed upon request.These results suggest that the 10 NPIs studied generally corresponded to decreases in case, hospitalization, and mortality rates in the first wave, with some exceptions.In terms of the per capita estimates, 2 NPIs (policy stringency and mask use) were largely associated with fewer cases across the observed lags, whereas bar/restaurant closures corresponded to decreased mortality after 4 weeks.Regarding mortality rates, policy stringency, SIPOs, masks, limited gatherings, and business and school closures all corresponded to negative estimates.By contrast, all NPIs except social distancing and business and restaurant closures were associated with reduced case growth rates.Additionally, the 2 NPIs studied in hospitalizations (SIPOs and mask wearing) showed mitigative effects.

(p10.1) Despite observing mostly mitigative effects across the 3 outputs, it is important to highlight the few instances of increased mortality.Most notably, business closures gave negative point estimates for deaths per capita early on (i.e., before the fourth week), but not later, suggesting that these measures might only have a short-term effect and any prolonged adoption could be either counterproductive or detrimental.Limited gatherings, on the other hand, were associated with increased per capita mortality after 2 and 4 weeks following implementation, hinting that this containment measure may not be effective in lowering the death toll.Spiegel and Tookes 51 attribute this increase in mortality to the fact that such measures may have caused substitution by the public into other types of activities that increase transmission.

(p10.2) Based on this review's findings, the authors highlight the effectiveness of response stringency and measures that limit internal movement (e.g., SIPOs) in mitigating the pandemic's impact.Policy makers, however, should be aware of the challenges in adopting such interventions.It is certain that forcing the population to stay at home would reduce the frequency of encounters with infected individuals, but this depends on mass compliance. 58The authors believe this could be one of the reasons why limited gatherings saw such a high correspondence with cases and mortality; it is difficult for authorities to ensure that individuals are not gathering in secret.Thus, the authors also highlight the importance of public interventions such as increased mask wearing.These NPIs help limit transmission in public spaces, suggesting that countries may not need to halt economic activity (i.e., close businesses and restrict travel) simply to curb the spread of the virus.In fact, these results showed quite the opposite, because business closures and travel restrictions were both, at some point, associated with increased instances of mortality.It is worth mentioning that policy stringency and mask wearing were related to decreased cases per capita but not mortality.One possible explanation for this is that the effect of NPIs is being observed in the number of cases, rather than in mortality.
