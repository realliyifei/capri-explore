## (s14) Countermeasures for Security & Privacy Concerns
(p14.0) (1) Sensing as a service model: Sensing has been introduced as a service model in Reference [22]. The smart city and IoT have different origins, but the sensors make them move into each other. To preserve the privacy of sensor data, the sensor owner can define restrictions, such as who can access what data. In addition, sensitive information collected by sensors, such as location data, needs to be altered implicitly to anonymize the data.
