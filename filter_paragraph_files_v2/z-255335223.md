## (s1) Photodynamic Dynamic Antibacterial Therapy Mechanistic Overview of Photodynamic Therapy
(p1.0) Light-actuated materials have been used for some time to treat infections, and for more than 100 years this has been called photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT needs two components to be useful: light and a material or compound that can be sharpened by bright ultraviolet (UV) or apparent locales of the electromagnetic range of visible light illumination ( Figure 1). Currently, photodynamic therapy is employed as an alternative therapy for the management of malignant disorders. It is based on the uptake of a photosensitizer molecule, which, when activated by light at a specific wavelength, combines with oxygen to produce oxidant species (radicals, singlet oxygen, and triplet species), which cause cell death in the target areas. It has been determined that PDT's cytotoxic effects result from the oxidation of a wide variety of biomolecules in cells, including nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which causes a serious modification in cell signaling cascades or in the regulation of gene expression. 44 The mechanism of PDT is described by two sorts of pathways: type I reaction involves electrons and holes transfer to generate radical and radical anion species and type 2 reaction goes through with energy transfer between oxygen and excited nanomaterials. The type I response system of nanomaterials under light illumination can produce ROS like hydroxyl radical (·OH), superoxide anion (·O 2 − ), and hydrogen peroxide and requires higher actuation energy.
