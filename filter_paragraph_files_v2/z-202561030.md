(p5.0) A multi-antenna transmitter wherein each antenna transmits a train of unsophisticated signals, amplitude-modulated by the slow-time code. In this case, P r = 1 and the N ×M T space-time code matrix G = [g 1 , . . . , g M T ] is the degree of freedom at the transmitter side [17]. Radars use radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. The operation of a typical MIMO radar receive chain is summarized in the box of Page 4. The radar range resolution is dictated, for a given Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), by the transmit bandwidth, i.e., 1/T r in (1). The velocity resolution is determined by the duration of coherent integration, i.e., N T in (2). In situations 1) and 3) no Doppler processing is undertaken, mainly due to the fact that typical single-pulse durations are too short to allow measuring the Doppler shift induced by targets in moderate radial motion. In settings 2) and 4) moving objects generate steering vectors and Doppler shifts up to 1 T can be unambiguously measured. Likewise, pulse trains with Pulse Repetition Time (PRT) T generate range ambiguities whereby scatterers located at distances corresponding to delays which are integer multiples of T contribute to the same range cell.

(p5.1) The signal model for the communication system is simpler in that we just have to distinguish between the case of single and multiple transmit antennas. In particular, we assume that the communication system operates on the same frequency band as the radar, occupying a fraction B L of its dedicated bandwidth. Setting T c = L/B, the signal radiated by the i-th transmit element is written as

(p5.2) where v i (p) is the data sequence to be transmitted, and ψ L (·) satisfies the Nyquist criterion with respect to T c = LT r . The situation of full spectral overlap corresponds to L = 1.
