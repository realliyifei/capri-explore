## (s16) Population.
(p16.0) Diagnosis can benefit from studying health problems in a population, for example, with a cohort study, and by comparing different individuals. Traditionally, cohort studies with medical images rely on hypothesis formation and statistical analysis, but the visualization and exploration of the imaging data are ignored. A visual analysis method combines hypothesis formation and reasoning with interactive volume rendering of multivariate brain MRI and fMRI cohort study data [99]. With multiplelinked views, the method supports the exploration of the bidirectional correlations between the volume rendering and clinical parameters and the comparison of different patient groups.
