## (s10) | Future perspectives
(p10.0) Currently, there is great potential and significant room for improvement with respect to the pathogenesis and treatment of DFUs. First, it is necessary to clearly understand the pathogenesis of DFUs as it is the cornerstone of curing this condition. Only by accurately comprehending the regulation of the pathogenesis of DFUs can new drugs or interventions for relevant targets be developed.

(p10.1) Additionally, the use of stem cells to treat DFUs is emerging as a promising treatment. Embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells can be induced to differentiate into myofibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells, which are components of wound healing. 124 At the same time, stem cells synthesize and secrete several cytokines to promote cell recruitment, immune regulation, ECM remodeling, angiogenesis, and nerve regeneration. 125 However, unlimited cloning and proliferation of stem cells pose great challenges, such as the formation of skin tumors, in clinical treatment. We always firmly believed that based on the unremitting efforts of researchers worldwide, stem cell proliferation and differentiation will eventually be accurately regulated and streamlined.
