## (s5) MONOTERPENES IN THE CARBON CYCLE
(p5.0) Habitats with a dense vegetation of wood and flowers are expected to contain larger populations of monoterpene transforming microorganisms. Whereas coniferous forests emit up to 6.7 g carbon * m −2 * yr −1 , broadleaf evergreen forest and grassland emit only 3.5 and 2.5 g carbon * m −2 * yr −1 , respectively (Tanaka et al., 2012). Monoterpene emission rates between 0.3 and 7 g carbon * m −2 * yr −1 for the United States-mainly αand β-pinene, limonene and β-myrcene (Geron et al., 2000)-can support the aerobic growth of 0.15-3.5 g bacteria * m −2 * yr −1 , assuming 50% of carbon incorporated into biomass. This is a significant potential, considering the presence of around 10 g microbial biomass in the top centimeter of soil per square meter.
