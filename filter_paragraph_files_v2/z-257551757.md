## (s9) Methodological quality assessment
(p9.0) The quality of the included SRs was evaluated using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2) tool (21). There were 16 evaluation items. The reporting was assessed as being sufficiently reported and performed (Yes), insufficiently reported (Partial Yes), or not reported (No). The overall confidence in the results of the review was rated as follows: critically low quality (more than one critical flaw with or without non-critical weaknesses), low quality (one critical flaw with or without non-critical weaknesses), moderate quality (more than one non-critical weakness), and high quality (zero or one non-critical weakness). The AMSTAR 2 tool was used by two authors (JHJ and TYC). If there was a disagreement, the other authors (SP and MSL) resolved the disagreement.
