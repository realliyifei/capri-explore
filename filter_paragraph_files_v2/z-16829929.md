## (s1) II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
(p1.0) To the best of our knowledge, there are no comprehensive surveys performed on visualization tools for environmental data.However, a survey similar to ours was conducted for visualization tools of biological network analysis [5].Visualization tools such as Medusa, Cytoscape, BioLayout Express3D, ProViz, and Pajek were reviewed in this survey.These tools were assessed based on their visualization capabilities, efficiency, compatibility with other tools, supported input data formats, user-friendliness, and applicability.

(p1.1) The authors summarize the survey by suggesting tools for each outlined challenge such as integration of heterogeneous data, scalability, interconnectivity, and pattern recognition.Also, several of the more specialized tools that are used for visualizing the biological networks are mentioned, but are not reviewed in the survey.Furthermore, standard network file formats used for representing biological networks such as BioPAX, SBML, CellML and RDF are discussed and evaluated.The paper also discusses several challenges faced by visualization tools representing biological networks.For example, one of such challenges is user-friendliness in the case when thousands of nodes need to be visualized (because most tools become less efficient and slower when operating with large datasets).The authors suggest outsourcing the computational load by using web services or rewriting the existing algorithms.Another challenge faced by the visualization tools is that of representing heterogeneous data.
