## (s2) Aesthetic and musicological evaluation of the created work
(p2.0) The reception of music is influenced by a number of factors, and these factors are also subject to an objective but also subjective nature. The perception of the components of the composition is often derived from personal experiences and feelings, which only further complicates the possibility of aesthetic evaluation. (Schindler et al. 2017) Since it seems almost impossible to find a method that would fully take into account the general subjective evaluation of the artistic values of musical works, we are offered a questionnaire survey, which could verify based on lay and professional interest, whether the composition follows certain rules of musical composition, or whether it is even possible to label the resulting composition as a creative act. In the case of automated systems for algorithmic composition, which are to reproduce human creativity in some way, there is a problem with the evaluation of their performance: the concept of artistic creativity escapes a formal, unambiguous and effective definition. This makes it difficult to evaluate these systems quite thoroughly.
