## (s7) Inflammatory Mechanisms
(p7.0) RA is a well-known immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by high levels of major proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and IL6, suggesting dysregulations between the innate and adaptive (auto) immune system pathophysiology [19].
## (s11) Structural Changes in RA Patients with Depression
(p11.0) Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown how peripheral inflammation, a hallmark of RA, affects the structure and connectivity of the brain. Schrepf and colleagues found altered patterns of brain connectivity in RA patients with higher levels of disease activity, as well as evidence of inflammation-associated subnetwork reorganization [35].
## (s12) Effects of Depression in RA Patients
(p12.0) Depression in patients with RA is associated with poor long-term outcomes. Multiple studies have shown that depression in RA is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and physical disability. This alters treatment compliance, causes more comorbidities, and leads to higher mortality, partly through increased suicide risk. Depression in RA increases health service utilization and healthcare costs directly through hospitalization, but also indirectly through loss of work productivity. It also considerably decreases quality of life (QoL) for RA patients, a fact that is reflected in all domains of QoL questionnaires [41]. Additionally, psychological distress may impact health outcomes by influencing other health behaviors alongside medication adherence, such as smoking and physical activity. Reduced levels of physical activity can result in deconditioning, loss of natural endorphins, and increased pain [13].
## (s17) Depression Increases Healthcare Resource Utilization
(p17.0) Depression in RA can also increase healthcare resource utilization, which can lead to high health care expenditures for both insurance payers, patients, and families. The burden of depression has high socioeconomic costs including workplace absenteeism and presenteeism, and workplace productivity is associated with functional disability and depressive symptoms [12]. Moreover, the presence of depression along with any chronic physical condition more than doubles the likelihood of work absenteeism as compared to the presence of any chronic physical condition without depression [58].
## (s18) Discussion
(p18.0) Depression is highly prevalent in RA, and the toll it takes on the quality of life of patients suggests that in routine clinical practice and corresponding follow-up procedures, patients should be screened for the presence of depressive symptoms [5]. Diagnosing and treating depression in this category of patients should be part of standard patient care, but that implies using validated screening questionnaires against the gold standard for detecting depression. A full diagnostic assessment should be made after positive screening results [59] in order to confirm the diagnosis and to minimize the risk of attributing depression to RA in the presence of concomitant etiological disease (such as iatrogenic effects or other psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders associated with depression).
