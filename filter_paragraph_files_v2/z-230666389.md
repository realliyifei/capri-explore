## (s11) Gluten
(p11.0) Gluten is a factor contributing to intestinal inflammation in TNF-α knockout mice (a mouse model of genetic predisposition to IBD). It is postulated that amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), a family of non-gluten proteins found in gluten containing cereals can regulate the release of inflammatory cytokines, activate Toll-Like Receptors and induce a T-cell response in both coeliac and non-coeliac patients, including those with IBD [69,70].

(p13.0) Gluten is a factor contributing to intestinal inflammation in TNF-α knockout mice (a mouse model of genetic predisposition to IBD). It is postulated that amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), a family of non-gluten proteins found in gluten containing cereals can regulate the release of inflammatory cytokines, activate Toll-Like Receptors and induce a T-cell response in both coeliac and non-coeliac patients, including those with IBD [69,70].
## (s20) Diet as Prescribed Therapy for Active Disease in IBD
(p20.0) There are several prescriptive dietary approaches that have been studied for use in routine clinical practice to manage IBD flares (Table 4). Due to the restrictive nature of these dietary regimens, they are largely reserved for the most unwell patients or those wanting to avoid the use of steroid-based medications, particularly children in whom steroids can impact upon growth trajectory [142]. 
## (s24) Real Food Diet
(p24.0) The CD-TREAT study evaluated the effects of an individualised food-based diet, which aimed to re-create the benefits of an EEN diet by exclusion of specific dietary components, such as gluten, lactose and alcohol. It was found to have a similar impact to EEN on the gut microbiome, inflammation and clinical response in a rat model as well as in healthy adults and children with CD. This diet was easier for patients to comply with and more acceptable than EEN [147].
