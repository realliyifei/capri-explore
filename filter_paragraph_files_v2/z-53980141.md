## (s8) Screening process and data extraction
(p8.0) The search will be executed by our academic librarian (MVD), and the results managed using Endnote™ X.7.5.3. De-duplication of search findings will be done according to Bramer's method [67]. De-duplicated results will be imported into Rayyan, a web-based tool designed to facilitate the screening process of literature reviews [68]. Prior to the actual screening process, we will choose a random sample (5%) of citations to conduct calibration screening. Two members of the Coordinated Multicenter Team (FH, KJM) will take part and review the same set of citations independently. We will calculate inter-rater agreement using the kappa statistic and start the screening process once a kappa ≥ 0.6 is achieved. Where discrepancies arise, these will be discussed and resolved by consensus or failing agreement, referred to a third team member for a final decision.
