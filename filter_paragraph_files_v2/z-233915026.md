## (s9) Climate change, migration, and mental health and wellbeing
(p9.0) There has been little investigation of the effects of potential migration linked to climate change on mental health and wellbeing in SIDS. This includes for the places most often mentioned as likely candidates for large-scale forced migration due to sea-level rise, namely the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu. Migration can be a highly stressful experience, especially when forced. The stress of migration can be exacerbated by a lack of social support, poor health systems, insufficient livelihoods, economic hardship, discrimination, and limited access to housing, education, social services, and healthcare. Consequences can include reduced self-esteem, poor adjustment to the new location, and increased rates of depression, phobias, and schizophrenia (e.g. Bennouna et al 2019, Henssler et al 2020, Selten et al 2020). Unpublished local anecdotes from people previously affected in the Pacific by forced migration from nuclear testing indicate that psychosocial impacts of forced migration can span generations, so corroboration through research methods would be an important task.
