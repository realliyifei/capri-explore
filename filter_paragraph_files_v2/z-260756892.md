(p9.0) Polyphenols from fermented juice, pericarp and oil inhibited the growth of breast cancer cell lines in vitro.This effect was greater in the oestrogen-dependent MCF-7 line than the oestrogen-independent MB-MDA-231 line.Fermented pomegranate juice polyphenols consistently showed about twice the antiproliferative effect as fresh pomegranate juice polyphenols.Oestrogen synthesis was inhibited by a 60-80% reduction in aromatase activity.

(p9.1) As previously mentioned, a tumour needs to receive sufficient nutrients and oxygen and have the ability to evacuate waste in order to sustain growth.It achieves this through angiogenesis and VEGF is the most potent stimulator of this process.EA markedly inhibits angiogenesis-associated activities including proliferation, migration/invasion and capillary formation on VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells in vitro at doses of 2.5 to 20 Î¼M.It directly inhibited VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity and its downstream signalling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/Akt in endothelial cells.In vivo, EA inhibited vessel formation in chick chorioallantoic membrane and sprouts formation of chicken aorta.In breast cancer xenografts, EA significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cancer growth and P-VEGFR2 expression.The authors concluded very low toxicity of EA given there were no abnormal morphological changes to the cancer cell lines and in vivo there was sprout recurrence from the chick aortic arch once EA was removed [42].To our knowledge, there have been no clinical studies performed regarding the effects of EA on breast cancer.
