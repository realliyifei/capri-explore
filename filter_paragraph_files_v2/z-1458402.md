## (s14) Hepatoprotective Effects.
(p14.0) Study was conducted on different doses of Eucommia ulmoides and carbon tetrachloride on Sprague Dawley male rats to investigate the protective effects of EU in response to CCl 4 induced acute liver lipid accumulation. Results demonstrated that Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. cortex extracts (EUCE) significantly decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation induced by CCl 4 . EU enhances lysosomal enzyme activity relieving protein folding requirement which turns into attenuation of ER stress. ApoB secretion was improved by effects of ER stress; along this, it regulates biotransformation of CCl 4 and its resultant inhibition of ROS accumulation [88].
