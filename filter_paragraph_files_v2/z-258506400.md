## (s7) Oxidative phosphorylation
(p7.0) In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that glucocorticoids affect mitochondrial function of kidney, brain, and muscle in a biphasic manner [86]. Short-term and/or low levels appear protective, inducing calcium accumulation and increasing both expression and activity of electron transport chain components. However, long-term exposure and/or high concentrations cause mitochondrial dysfunction with inhibition of calcium influx and holding capacity and decreased activity of the respiratory chain, ultimately resulting in decreased oxidative ATP production. Innate: α-ARs activation ↑inflammation; β 2 -AR activation ↓inflammation including chemotaxis, phagocytosis and ROS for respiratory burst.
## (s13) Apoptosis
(p13.0) Although endocrine induced effects on apoptosis have been widely described, it must be noted that apoptosis is regulated by both intrinsic mitochondrial pathways and extrinsic non-mitochondrial pathways. Glucocorticoids are well-known regulators of apoptosis during lymphocyte maturation, but mixed effects have been found depending again on duration of exposure and concentration. Acute and/or low doses of glucocorticoids protect mitochondria and prevent programmed cell death, while chronic and/or long-term exposure increase apoptosis [86].
