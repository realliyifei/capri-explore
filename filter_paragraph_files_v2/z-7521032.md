## (s12) Dermatitis herpetiformis
(p12.0) In contrast to pemphigus and pemphigoid diseases, the evidence for sex predominance in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) has been conflicting. Dermatitis herpetiformis has been shown to associate closely with celiac disease, as both conditions are mediated by IgA autoantibodies targeting the autoantigen transglutaminase. Although a small study has reported that DH has a male-to-female ratio ranging from 1.5 to 2, the opposite of this was found in a larger study of celiac disease, which has a female-to-male ratio ranging from 2 to 4.1 (Llorente-Alonso et al., 2006). The conflicting findings from the two studies prompt further research regarding DH's epidemiology.
