## (s8) Lifestyle modification in COPD patients
(p8.0) It is known that lifestyle modification is one of the most cost-effective strategies for self-management and secondary treatment of COPD.Hence, we should know the required lifestyle changes or modifications that are needed in COPD patients [9].
## (s11) Getting Vaccinated
(p11.0) COPD is known to cause lung damage, so one can prevent further lung damage by avoiding infections like pneumonia and influenza by getting vaccinated for such infections as such conditions are the major cause of exacerbation, disease progression, and mortality in COPD.In this way, their lungs are protected from any kind of further damage that could be caused by such infections.So, vaccination is recommended for individuals suffering from COPD, in lifestyle modification [13].
## (s20) Inhalers
(p20.0) Inhalers are an essential tool in COPD management, conveying medicines straightforwardly to the aviation routes.Some of the inhalers that are used are metered-portion inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and soft mist inhalers (SMIs).These gadgets have seen nonstop enhancements in drug conveyance proficiency, usability, and versatility.For example, few inhalers presently have hidden sensors that monitor usage and give inputs to patients and medical services suppliers [22].
## (s21) Nebulizers
(p21.0) Nebulizers are devices that convert fluid medicine into a fine fog, which makes it simpler for the patients to breathe in the medication.Late advancements have focused on reducing treatment duration utilizing the nebulizer frameworks [23].
## (s27) Remote Observing Frameworks
(p27.0) Advancements in this area have been found as a unique advantage in the administration of persistent illnesses like COPD.Ongoing advances in remote checking for COPD include remote painless gadgets that monitor fundamental signs, oxygen immersion levels, and respiratory boundaries, communicating continuous information to medical services suppliers.Integration of computerized reasoning and AI calculations into remote observing frameworks empowers early discovery of COPD intensifications because of minor modifications in information frameworks [30].
## (s28) Telemedicine
(p28.0) Telemedicine refers to the use of information and communications technology to deliver health services, particularly in situations when access to care is hampered by distance.The use of telemedicine is favored by a number of significant features, including real-time audio and video communication that links doctors and patients at the same time, information exchange that does not require both individuals to be present at the same time, and the use of a variety of wearable devices, accessories, sensors, etc.These characteristics guarantee that patients' sense of security, health awareness, and medication adherence are all positively impacted in a way that saves both time and money [31].
## (s29) Single Inhaler Triple-Drug Therapy
(p29.0) A novel advancement has been discovered recently: the ability to combine three medications into one inhaler.It involves the combination of fixed ICS/LABA with LAMA or vice versa.This method prevented the overuse of medications and exacerbation risk while maintaining a high level of safety and health.It also demonstrated improved lung function when compared to ICS/LABA or independent LAMA treatment [32]. Figure 3 shows the newly developed inhaler that combines three medicines, becoming a triple-drug inhaler.
## (s31) Advantages
(p31.0) The ongoing advances in devices used for the therapy of COPD bring various benefits and advantages that preferentially work on the administration as well as on the personal satisfaction of patients.Some of the benefits of these advances in devices are mentioned in the following paragraph.

(p31.1) Current inward breath gadgets, like excellent inhalers and further developed DPIs, guarantee more exact and viable medication conveyance to the lung [22].This designated conveyance upgrades the helpful viability of medicines, promoting better side effects control and decreased aftereffects.Smart inhalers and remote observing frameworks enhance drug adherence by reminding patients to take their assigned portions on time and follow their medicine use.The ability to provide mixed treatments in a solitary inhaler can enable treatment regimens customized for individual COPD patients.This approach ensures that the patient gets the right blend of prescriptions, enhancing their treatment and possibly lessening the number of endorsed inhalers they need to utilize.
