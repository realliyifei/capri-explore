## (s12) Optical Lithography Techniques
(p12.0) Optical lithography-based methods have been extensively used for the fabrication of microfluidic channels. SU-8 is one of the most popular materials in this method as it has high mechanical rigidity, and chemical stability, as well as a defined shape and size [68]. SU-8 has also been used for the fabrication of masters of in-line micro-valves with different aspect ratios via lithography techniques due to its chemical and thermal stability after polymerization and allows mass production from a single master mold [69]. In another interesting work, polystyrene (PS), which is a commonly used material for biological and biomedical applications due to its high biocompatibility, has been used for the fabrication of microstructures with 20 µm resolution with direct optical lithography [70].
