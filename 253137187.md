## Introduction

Sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation and immune dysregulation, has become an increasingly well-known cause of cardiac disease which has been shown to have a worse prognosis compared to patients without cardiac involvement [1]. Treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis is challenging, infliximab is the most commonly used anti-TNF in the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis. Recently, it was shown that infliximab containing regimens are superior to those containing corticosteroids [2]. We previously reported a case of effective treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis using adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNF agent [3]. Thus, we hypothesized that patients with cardiac sarcoidosis may be responsive to adalimumab therapy. Here, we describe a case series of seven patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who were treated with adalimumab therapy.


## Patients and methods

This is a retrospective study that describes our experience of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who received adalimumab therapy at the University of Illinois Health (UIH) between 2011 and 2022. The aim of this study was to describe the safety and tolerability of adalimumab in the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis. Inclusion criteria included all patients who had the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and received adalimumab between 2011 and 2022. Patients were identified retrospectively by searching electronic medical records. The study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Review Board (UIC IRB protocol #2021-0659).

In total, seven patients with cardiac sarcoidosis were identified and their clinical course before and after the initiation of adalimumab therapy was assessed by electronic medical record abstraction. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on ATS/ERS/WASOG criteria and supported by extra-cardiac tissue biopsy [4]. Other causes of granulomas were excluded. The diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis was based on clinical presentation as well as advanced cardiac imaging in concordance with both the 2014 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) expert consensus statement [5] and The Japanese Society of Cardiology expert consensus diagnostic criteria (2017) [6]. Advanced cardiac imaging with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans was also performed in all patients as part of the diagnostic and follow-up workup (except for S5 whose last follow-up FDG-PET is still pending). All patients followed a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet that we described in 2017 prior to FDG-PET scans [7] Those are complex patients that required a multidisciplinary team approach including second and third opinions at multiple academic centers. The clinical response was defined as the ability to decrease the need for corticosteroids without worsening of cardiac symptoms, all these patients were treated and followed by the sarcoidosis team at UIC and the response was assessed by a retrospective chart review. The adalimumab regimen was identical to the regimen we used in the clinical trial of pulmonary sarcoidosis [8]. Adalimumab (40 mg subcutaneous injection) was administered on a weekly basis as third-line therapy. The doses of the other immunosuppressants were unchanged for at least 30 days prior to the first adalimumab dose. In accordance with well-accepted clinical practice, all patients received conventional therapy for a duration of at least one year after the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. In six out of seven patients, therapy was escalated to adalimumab because of persistent cardiac manifestations by FDG-PET despite being on corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy. One patient (S5) required escalation to adalimumab while on conventional therapy because of disfiguring skin lesions; however, FDG-PET performed prior to initiation of adalimumab demonstrated cardiac uptake. The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Absolute lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood as well as lymphocyte subset enumeration measured by flow cytometry before and after treatment with adalimumab are shown in Table 3.


## Results

Clinical responses to adalimumab were universally positive in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis Adalimumab therapy was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported. Five patients discontinued corticosteroids and two patients lowered the dose. Six out of the seven patients had a follow-up FDG-PET scan, two out of the six showed partial resolution of cardiac sarcoidosis compared to the initial FDG-PET-scan and the other four showed complete resolution as shown in Table 2. Of note, none of these patients showed active extracardiac manifestations of sarcoidosis and there were no arrhythmic episodes and hospitalizations while on adalimumab therapy between the period 2015-2022. It was noted that All patients showed an increase in their absolute peripheral lymphocytes after adalimumab was initiated ( Table 3). The change in absolute lymphocyte, CD4 + T-cell, and CD19 + B-cell count are summarized in Figs. 1 and 2A. Also, S5 showed a steep increase in CD19 + B-cell count as the patient was treated recently and was introduced to adalimumab therapy much earlier given disfiguring facial lesion.


## Discussion

Infliximab is the only anti-TNF that has been tested in a randomized controlled study in patients with sarcoidosis [9]. We have previously shown the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in a prospective non-randomized clinical trial in pulmonary sarcoidosis [8]. Subsequent studies showed the benefit of using adalimumab in patients who developed adverse events to infliximab in sarcoidosis [10]. The use of anti-TNF remains controversial [11]. Biomarkers that predict response to anti-TNF therapy in sarcoidosis are not well-defined, thus assessing therapeutic response to anti-TNF therapy in cardiac sarcoidosis is challenging. In a post-hoc analysis, we showed that C-reactive protein may predict response of pulmonary sarcoidosis to infliximab therapy [12]. However, biomarkers for response to adalimumab therapy have not been identified. Given the multiple comorbidities in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and the concern for arrhythmias, we chose the subcutaneous approach using adalimumab to avoid potential infusion reactions and to avoid the possibility of human chimeric antibody (HACA) formation in response to infliximab treatment. Given the difficulties of identifying   PET (November 14,2016):

There is increased myocardial uptake noted in the anterior and anterolateral wall of the left ventricle primarily, with low-level increased uptake also noted in the inferior septal region. On the targeted, reformatted images of the heart, there are similar findings noted, also with increased uptake involving the anterior and anterolateral walls, with less intense increased uptake also noted in a patchy distribution in the septum, as well as mildly increased uptake in the inferior wall. 


## PET ( July 7,2014):

There is a medium-sized area of reduced perfusion with intense FDG uptake in the basal anterior and inferior segments, suggestive of active inflammation such as sarcoidosis in these segments More advanced disease with less active inflammation manifested by severely reduced to absent perfusion and mild to moderate FDG uptake may be found in the apex and the entire septum.


## PET (November 26,2019):

There is new intense activity in the base of the left ventricle extending to the interventricular septum. There is new intense activity along the anterior wall of the left ventricle, which is more intense than the proximal portion, and extends distally approaching the apex. There is new intense activity circumferentially along the base of the heart and slightly to the proximal anterior wall.  one validated outcome measure in treating cardiac sarcoidosis and the retrospective nature of this study, we chose to use the safety of adalimumab and the reduction or discontinuation of corticosteroid dose as the outcome to response given the deleterious effects of corticosteroids in sarcoidosis patients [2]. Of note, our cohort consisted mostly of white male patients, a finding consistent with the Zhou et al. study [13]. All patients were receiving corticosteroids and immunosuppressants (second line agents) as shown in Table 1. Moreover, it was noted that all patients have lymphopenia of less than 1.3 kcell/ul within 3 months of initiating adalimumab therapy. Other causes of lymphopenia were excluded. Lymphopenia is a common feature in patients with sarcoidosis [14] and it may correlate with chronically active severe disease [14][15][16]. We recently reported a relationship between lymphopenia and sarcoidosis disease activity by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) [16]. Crouser et al. [17] described five patients with sarcoidosis and lymphopenia who responded to infliximab treatment with cardiac sarcoidosis manifest in three of the patients. It was concluded that lymphopenia identifies a distinct sarcoidosis phenotype that is responsive to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy [17].

Our current practice included evaluation of the lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood when patients present with an absolute lymphocyte count of less than 1.3 kcell/ul within 3 months.

Adalimumab has been used off-label in the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis. Table 4 summarizes the published reports using  adalimumab for the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis. However, infliximab is the most widely used anti-TNF agent in cardiac sarcoidosis. Harper et al. [18] demonstrated the safety and efficacy of infliximab in cardiac sarcoidosis treatment in their retrospective series of 36 patients with refractory sarcoidosis treated with infliximab. In their study, 24 out of 36 patients showed a favorable response as defined by at least one of the following: steroid dose reduction, improvement in arrhythmia control, or increase in left ventricular ejection fraction without deterioration of systolic function [18]. Similarly, findings from more recent studies further supported the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in cardiac sarcoidosis patients, the majority of whom received infliximab [19][20][21]. A recent meta-analysis of the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis excluded anti-TNF therapy due to the fact that it is used only in refractory cardiac sarcoidosis [18,22]. The immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis is complex and the exact mechanism of improvement of lymphopenia following adalimumab therapy remains speculative. It is unknown if peripheral lymphopenia in sarcoidosis identifies a subset of patients who will have a favorable response to anti-TNF therapy. In a phase 4 clinical trial, we identified IL-7R as a biomarker for anti-TNF response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) peripheral blood mononuclear cells [23]. We previously demonstrated that IL-7R may play a role in sarcoidosis [24]. IL-7 is a novel sarcoidosis cytokine and is a master regulator of lymphocytes [25]. Possible explanations include relief of T cell overactivation in part by rebalancing the expanded innate immune reprogramming seen in a subset of patients with sarcoidosis. The immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis is complex, while T-cells are one of the major players in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis B cells play a role in the disease as well [26]. We have shown that B cell-depleting therapy using rituximab may be effective in sarcoidosis [27]. The improvement of CD19 + lymphopenia in this cohort further emphasizes the role of B cells in this disease. We hypothesize that T-cell and B-cell trafficking to areas of active granulomas may be regulated by TNF, IL-7 and IL-7R pathway and may be corrected by neutralizing TNF (See Fig. 2B). Such a hypothesis is speculative and requires large randomized controlled trials with a mechanistic arm to identify the actual role of TNF and IL-7R in regulation of granuloma formation and resolution in various sarcoidosis phenotypes. This is of particular value in light of the challenging nature of cardiac sarcoidosis treatment, the lack of a standardized definition of refractory cardiac sarcoidosis, the lack of biomarkers that identify responsive phenotypes, and the lack of FDA-approved therapies.

Our study has several limitations including the retrospective nature of the study and its inherent problems including selection bias, small sample size, and the lack of a control group. Since we are a referral center most patients who are seen already had some initial testing thus, we did not have the absolute lymphocyte count before conventional therapy. While it would be helpful to have baseline absolute lymphocyte counts and flow cytometry prior to conventional treatment and correlate them with inflammation, checking flow cytometry is not standard-of-care without lymphopenia on CBC. It was extremely difficult to standardize the approach to management of cardiac sarcoidosis, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another limitation is the lack of a comparison group without lymphopenia which will require a future multi-center study. Despite these limitations, our observations are consistent with a study  [2] as well as with those of Crouser et al. [17]. Given the enormous cost associated with advanced cardiac imaging, and the associated radiation exposure, identifying a peripheral biomarker that tracks response to therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis is important. A prospective well-designed translational study in cardiac sarcoidosis is needed to serve this complex patient population.


## Conclusions

This case series represents a unique cohort of predominantly Caucasian patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who were responsive to adalimumab therapy as measured by improvement in advanced cardiac imaging and the ability to discontinue or reduce corticosteroids. Further Large prospective studies are warranted to determine the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis.


## Clinical perspective

The role of adalimumab in treating patients with cardiac sarcoidosis has not been determined so far. Our small case series describes favorable safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles of adalimumab in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.


## Translational outlook

Future randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted to determine the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and the mechanisms of improvement of lymphopenia after adalimumab therapy.


## Learning points

• In a small retrospective case series, adalimumab was shown to be safe in the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis.

• Adalimumab showed a steroid-sparing effect in this small case series.

• Lymphopenia is a common feature of sarcoidosis, the effect of anti-TNF therapy on lymphopenia in sarcoidosis patients requires further evaluation.
