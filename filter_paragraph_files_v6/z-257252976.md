(p0.0) Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), a viral respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 [1]. As of 19 January 2023, there have been 663,248,631 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6,709,387 deaths worldwide [2].

(p0.1) Accumulating evidence supports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not merely a respiratory virus per se but can potentially affect other organ systems including the placenta. The notion of pregnancy as an altered state of immune suppression is well documented. Questions have been raised in regard to the safety and impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on both the mothers and their unborn babies. Pregnant mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Those who are symptomatic appear to be at a higher risk for developing severe sequelae of COVID-19 such as an increasing need for mechanical ventilation, ventilatory support, and death, compared with reproductive age-matched nonpregnant females [3]. Emerging evidence has shown that the severity of COVID-19 disease in pregnancy is associated with maternal comorbidities including gestational hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and advanced maternal age [3,4].

(p0.2) Like certain viral infections in pregnancies, pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at greater risk of pregnancy complications such as premature birth and possibly cesarean delivery, which is likely related to severe maternal illness [3]. Irrespective of the emerging reported cases of neonatal COVID-19, reassuringly, vertical transmission is rare [5,6]. The majority of the neonates born to COVID-19-positive mothers were spared from getting infected, despite the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein being detected in the placental villi. Congenital viral syndromes following maternal COVID-19 infection have not yet been reported thus far [7]. A successful pregnancy is dependent on a healthy and functioning placenta. The protective role of the placenta in limiting in utero spread of the virus to the developing fetus is intriguing.

(p8.0) The maternal-fetal interface is the direct point of contact between the mother and her fetus and governs the fetal development, regulates the maternal immune system, and safeguards the fetus from pathogens [29]. It is composed of both the maternal and fetal tissues and consists of multiple cell types. The maternal side consists of decidual stromal cells, and a wide range of decidual immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. Decidual NK cells (70%) and macrophages (20%) are the major immune cell population at the maternal-fetal interface. As well as being engaged in immunosurveillance, decidual NK cells are mainly responsible for immune tolerance to the fetus, uterine spiral artery remodeling, and EVT cell invasion [78]. The fetal side is made of placental chorionic villus, formed by a mesenchymal core containing fetal blood vessels and Hofbauer cells, surrounded by inner villous cytotrophoblasts and outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts, an epithelial covering that is in direct contact with maternal circulation [29]. Hofbauer cells can be found in villous stroma as early as three weeks post conception and are present in all stages of gestation. They are presumed to play diverse roles: they not only serve as immune cells, but are also involved in promoting and regulating placental morphogenesis and angiogenesis [79].
