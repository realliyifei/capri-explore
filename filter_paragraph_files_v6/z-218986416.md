(p7.0) In one of the early clinical adjuvant phase III trials in BTC 508 patients with BTC (n = 279), ampullary carcinoma (n = 56), or pancreatic cancer (n = 173) were randomized between adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C and observation following surgical resection. (Takada et al., 2002) Of note, this clinical trial included patients who had undergone curative resections, defined in this study as a microscopically radical resection (R0) of the primary tumor with removal of regional lymph node, as well as patients who had undergone surgical resections in the presence of peritoneal (4.3%), liver (5.7%), and other metastasis (0.9%). The majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma (86.4%) and gallbladder cancer (93.8%) had positive regional lymph nodes. In the subgroup of patients in whom a microscopically radical resection was achieved (n = 123), the five-year OS (primary endpoint of the study) in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (n = 72) treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C was not significantly different compared to those in the observation arm (41.0% versus 28.3%, P = 0.48). The five-year DFS rate was 32.4% and 15.8% in the treatment versus observation arm (P = 0.29). In patients with completely resected gallbladder cancer (n = 51), the five-year OS in patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C compared to observation was not statistically significant (46.4% versus 30.9%, P = 0.15). The difference in five-year DFS was not statistically significant between both arms (35.5% versus 25.0%, P = 0.12). In the subgroup analysis of all patients with gallbladder cancer, except those with liver and/or peritoneal metastasis, adjuvant chemotherapy was correlated with significantly longer RFS (HR 0.57, P = 0.05) and OS (HR 0.55, P = 0.03) in the multivariate analysis compared to observation. The completion rates of fluorouracil treatment were 79.3% and 94.2% in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, respectively. Patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C had higher rates of adverse events, including leucocytopenia (12.9%), anorexia (22.4%) and nausea/vomiting (12.9%, compared to observation).

The primary endpoint is RFS and the secondary endpoints are OS, adverse events, and quality of life.

(p18.0) The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2019) clinical practice guideline recommends adjuvant capecitabine for a duration of six months based on the results of the BILCAP trial. (Shroff et al., 2019) This guideline suggests also that patients with perihilar, distal cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder cancer and positive surgical resection margin may be candidates for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

(p18.1) In the European Association for Medical Oncology (ESMO, 2016) guideline and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline (version 3.0, 2019) for BTC, the results of the BILCAP trial were not yet adopted. The ESMO guideline does not recommend adjuvant therapy due to the absence of positive results from randomized phase III trials. (Valle et al., 2016) The ESMO guideline indicates that patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials and that outside the scope of clinical trials a multidisciplinary team may choose to offer adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone) to patients based on the best available evidence and only after considering the adverse events against the expected benefit from this treatment. (Valle et al., 2016) The NCCN guideline (version 3.0, august 2019) suggest various adjuvant treatment options mainly based on data from phase II trials.(National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), 2019) The NCCN guideline does not define a standard regimen or the definitive benefit from each suggested treatment because of limited available data. Possible adjuvant treatment options in patients with a negative microscopic resection margin and tumor-positive regional lymph nodes include: observation, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, or fluoropyrimidine-based chemo(radio) therapy. In case of positive microscopic resection margin or tumor involvement of regional lymph nodes, adjuvant therapy options include among others: gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or fluoropyrimidine chemo(radio)therapy. Participation in clinical trials is recommend for all patients regardless of the status of resection margin and regional lymph nodes.

(Valle et al., 2016) The ESMO guideline indicates that patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials and that outside the scope of clinical trials a multidisciplinary team may choose to offer adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone) to patients based on the best available evidence and only after considering the adverse events against the expected benefit from this treatment.

(p57.0) In one of the early clinical adjuvant phase III trials in BTC 508 patients with BTC (n = 279), ampullary carcinoma (n = 56), or pancreatic cancer (n = 173) were randomized between adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C and observation following surgical resection. (Takada et al., 2002) Of note, this clinical trial included patients who had undergone curative resections, defined in this study as a microscopically radical resection (R0) of the primary tumor with removal of regional lymph node, as well as patients who had undergone surgical resections in the presence of peritoneal (4.3%), liver (5.7%), and other metastasis (0.9%). The majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma (86.4%) and gallbladder cancer (93.8%) had positive regional lymph nodes. In the subgroup of patients in whom a microscopically radical resection was achieved (n = 123), the five-year OS (primary endpoint of the study) in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (n = 72) treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C was not significantly different compared to those in the observation arm (41.0% versus 28.3%, P = 0.48). The five-year DFS rate was 32.4% and 15.8% in the treatment versus observation arm (P = 0.29). In patients with completely resected gallbladder cancer (n = 51), the five-year OS in patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C compared to observation was not statistically significant (46.4% versus 30.9%, P = 0.15). The difference in five-year DFS was not statistically significant between both arms (35.5% versus 25.0%, P = 0.12). In the subgroup analysis of all patients with gallbladder cancer, except those with liver and/or peritoneal metastasis, adjuvant chemotherapy was correlated with significantly longer RFS (HR 0.57, P = 0.05) and OS (HR 0.55, P = 0.03) in the multivariate analysis compared to observation. The completion rates of fluorouracil treatment were 79.3% and 94.2% in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, respectively. Patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil plus mitomycin C had higher rates of adverse events, including leucocytopenia (12.9%), anorexia (22.4%) and nausea/vomiting (12.9%, compared to observation).

(p64.0) The ongoing phase III ACTICCA-01 trial was initiated in 2014 to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin every three weeks for a total of eight cycles versus observation in patients with cholangiocarcinoma or muscle-invasive gallbladder cancer following complete surgical resection. (Stein et al., 2015) After the presentation of the BILCAP trial results in 2017 at the ASCO meeting, the protocol has been amended to compare gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus capecitabine every three weeksinstead of observation. Patients stratification is based on lymph node status (N0 versus N1) and the localization of the tumor. A total of 781 patients will be included from various centers in Europe and Australia. The primary endpoint is RFS and the secondary endpoints are OS, adverse events, and quality of life.
