(p2.0) Apart from phosphorylation, tau is also extensively post-translationally modified by lysine acetylation, which leads to impaired tau function and promotes pathological aggregation, which in turn has prompted proposing the use of tau acetylation inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD and other tauopathies [6]. Thus, salsalate-a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) approved by the FDA to treat arthritis and other conditions that cause swelling-has been shown to inhibit acetyltransferase p300-induced tau acetylation and improve tau-mediated behavioral impairments and neurodegeneration in an frontotemporal dementia (FTD) mouse model [34]. This compound is about to complete a 6-month multicenter, open label, pilot futility phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of orally administered salsalate in 10 patients with PSP (NCT02422485). More recently, a phase 1b clinical trial has been launched with the aim of evaluating its safety and tolerability in patients with prodromal to mild AD (NCT03277573). Forty participants will be randomized to receive either a placebo or salsalate twice daily for 1 year. Outcomes include changes in cerebrosp√¨nal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRI, and cognitive function. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
