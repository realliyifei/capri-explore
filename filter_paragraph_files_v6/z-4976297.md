## (s11) Modifications to the nucleobase

(p11.0) Concurrently to the aforementioned approaches to modify the sugar moiety, numerous modifications were also being made to both the purine and the pyrimidine heterocyclic bases of the nucleosides. Analogous to various interactions involved in recognition and binding for the sugar of the nucleoside, enzyme-ligand recognition and binding also involves many different types of interactions with the base. Thus changing the sterics, electronics, or hydrogen bonding interactions can also significantly impact recognition, and subsequently, biological activity (Jordheim et al., 2013;De Clercq and Neyts, 2009;Deval, 2009). Modifications to the heterobase have primarily focused on adding substituents onto the base, removing or adding atoms to the rings themselves, or changing positions of the atoms. These types of changes have served to create many new classes of nucleoside analogues over the years.
