(p42.0) Policy measures regarding minimal interventions (screening and brief interventions) to control gambling and related harm are most likely effective [34]. However, many barriers intervene: lack of time, skills, motivation, and organizational factors. Policies and guidelines should promote the use of these interventions and training should support professionals. These interventions are more effective when combined with specific training, such as training targeted at gambling venue employees (see previous section), general practitioners [34], or nurses of geriatric patients [30]. Otherwise, staff and professionals may have difficulties in identifying indicators of problematic gamblers, and most of all may be reluctant to intervene [37].
