(p29.0) Li et al. [Li et al. 2010] proposed a method that projects face images with different resolutions into a common feature space for classification.Coupled mappings that minimize the difference between the correspondences (i.e., low-resolution and its corresponding high-resolution image) are learned.The online phase of this algorithm is a simple linear transformation, so it is more efficient than many alternatives that perform explicit synthesis/super-resolution.Zhou et al. [Zhou et al. 2011] proposed an approach named Simultaneous Discriminant Analysis (SDA).In this method, LR and HR images are projected into a common subspace by the mappings learned respectively by SDA.The mapping is designed to preserve the most discriminative information.Conventional classification methods can then be applied in the common space.
