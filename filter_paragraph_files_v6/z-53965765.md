(p3.0) The biosynthetic pathways of the common biogenic hydrocarbons, isoprene, and monoterpenes share a common precursor compound, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP, Fig. 1). This precursor and its isomer isopentenyl pyrophosphate are also precursors for important biological molecules such as carotenoids and cholesterol ). This last step in isoprene synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme isoprene synthase (Fig. 1). Progress has been made recently in understanding the controls acting on isoprene synthase. It appears to be a membrane-bound, lightactivated enzyme that catalyzes the elimination of pyrophosphate from DMAPP (Silver and Fall 1991;Wildermuth and Fall 1996). Changes in activity of isoprene synthase are correlated with changes in isoprene emission (Kuzma and Fall 1993).
