(p11.0) Pituitary apoplexy is a known rare phenomenon that can occur after infection with COVID-19. Additionally, there are several case reports of DI that have been described in patients weeks after COVID-19 infection [33]. Recently, there have been reports in the literature of hypophysitis related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the vaccine. Ankireddypalli et al. [34] reported a woman who experienced severe, persistent headache, myalgias, polyuria, and polydipsia two days after COVID-19 vaccination. MRI was obtained, and a thickened pituitary stalk was identified. The patient was diagnosed with DI and hypophysitis. Symptoms improved on 3-month follow-up, however, the thickened pituitary stalk remained. Additionally, there are reports of hypophysitis occurring between 2 weeks and 2 months after COVID-19 infection. Patients began experiencing headaches, laboratory-identified hypothyroidism, hypocortisolism, hypogonadism, and MRI supported a diagnosis of hypophysitis [35,36]. Although this is a rare complication, signs and symptoms of hypophysitis after a recent COVID-19 infection or vaccine should warrant appropriate investigation.
