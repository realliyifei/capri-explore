(p12.0) We now review regularity and curvature properties of m q . What contained in this section is a collection of results spread across [11,17,18] and [20]. We try here to give a unified presentation. We will inspect three increasing level of regularity: for q-a.e. q ∈ Q (R.1) m q has no atomic part, i.e. m q ({x}) = 0, for any x ∈ X q ; (R.2) m q is absolutely continuous with respect to H 1 Xq = g(q, ·) ♯ L 1 ; (R.3) m q = g(q, ·) ♯ (h q L 1 ) verifies CD(K, N ), i.e. the m.m.s. (R, | · |, h q L 1 ) verifies CD(K, N ).
