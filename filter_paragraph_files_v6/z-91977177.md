## (s2) THE BEHAVIOR OF SATELLITE CELLS IS REGULATED BY GENETIC AND EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS

(p2.0) Satellite cells, in intimate association with intact and mature myofibers, are known to persist in a quiescent state with a low transcriptional activity evidenced by the presence of more heterochromatin compared to post-mitotic myonuclei. It has been shown that oval-shaped nuclei of muscle stem cells presented facultative heterochromatin (fHC) [40]. Unlike constitutive heterochromatin, fHC can be dynamically converted in euchromatin, reactivating the expression of silenced genes and this mechanism seems to be important for the regulation of satellite cell functions. It has been demonstrated that the activity of the epigenetic enzyme Suv4-20h1, an H4K20 dimethyltransferase able to induce the condensation of chromatin, was related to the maintenance of SCs quiescence ( Fig. 2A) [40]. Interestingly, the absence of Suv4-20h1 results in loss of fHC by muscle stem cells, which undergo massive activation and proliferation, leading to the exhaustion of the myogenic stem cell pool and altered regeneration. This represents a pathologic feature of chronic and degenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophies. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating stem cell quiescence might represent a critical issue to design therapeutic approaches. A genome-wide analysis, comparing the gene expression profile of quiescent and proliferating satellite cells, identified a suite of genes up-regulated in quiescent satellite cells (qSCs) which included negative regulators of proliferation and myogenesis and genes involved in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix formation, copper and iron homeostasis, and lipid transportation [23]. Moreover, it has been reported that only quiescent satellite cells expressed the calcitonin receptor (CTR) which is thought to be involved in the preservation of the muscle stem cell pool. In fact, the stimulation with calcitonin induced a significant impairment of satellite cell activation in vitro, by inhibiting the ability of qSCs to re-enter the cell cycle ( Fig. 2A) [23]. Accordingly, studies performed using a CTR conditional knock-out mouse model confirmed that the calcitonin signaling, via cAMP/PKA axis, plays a determinant role in preserving the adult stem cell pool in skeletal muscle tissue [41]. The molecular profile associated with quiescent SCs has been defined in a recent elegant work [42]. This profile was used to select factors as Elcatonin, Forskolin and Somatostatin, able to maintain the dormant potent state of SCs in vitro, mimicking signals from their native environment [42].
