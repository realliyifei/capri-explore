(p1.0) As stated by the WHO, vaccines are pharmaceutical formulations that generate protective immunity against a disease by activating the production of specific antibodies by the immune system against a pathogen [12]. Vaccines are considered the most effective method to control epidemics, such as measles, diphtheria, and, eventually, SARS-CoV-2. The first vaccine used in the Western world was discovered by E. Jenner at the end of the eighteenth century against smallpox, a terrible cause of mortality at the time [13]. This vaccine was based on the cowpox virus. E. Jenner was a rural physician who realized that cattle workers who recovered from cowpox disease were protected against smallpox. However, he did not know that the disease was caused by a virus; an infectious agent that was not discovered and described until the twentieth century.

(p1.1) From a scientific point of view, classical vaccines are a direct consequence of the discovery by E. von Behring and S. Kitasato, at the end of the nineteenth century, of the presence of protective molecules, coined antibodies, in the plasma of patients who recovered from infections caused by bacteria, virus, or fungi [14]. These molecules also protected patients from future attacks by the same pathogen. This discovery generated a rush among microbiologists to identify the pathogens responsible for common infectious diseases at the time, including diphtheria, measles, and poliomyelitis, etc., to subsequently obtain protective vaccines. Antigens used to acquire protection include attenuated pathogens which lost the ability to infect after repetitive cultures in the laboratory (attenuated vaccines), such as the Calmette-Guerin vaccine based on M. bovis, against tuberculosis, and pathogens inactivated by heat or chemical agents (inactivated vaccines) [14,15]. In many cases, functional antigens for vaccines were composed of purified fragments of pathogens that elicited an immune response against the entire bacteria or virus.

(p8.0) Another approach currently being studied is the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as vehicles [46]. Evs are a heterogeneous group of extracellular bilayers produced by almost all cell types, including exosomes (50-150 nm), which are processed by the endosome as well as LNPs. These Evs also have good biocompatibility and immunogenicity and are being used in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics of different diseases. In this regard, the cellular source from which these EVs are derived is crucial, as it was shown that EVs can reproduce the properties of the cells from which they originate and could also work for their specific delivery, in combination to their transport function. The limitations associated with this approach focus on the characterization, isolation, and purification of homogeneous EVs as well as the loading and release of the drugs that they carry [46].
