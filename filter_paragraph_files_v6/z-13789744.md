I justify my proposal by pointing out that it is a duty of anthropology to develop a method for testing human physical capacity, similar to the methods worked out by psychologists to test mental capacity. Mental and physical capacities together constitute the working capacity and determine the working efficiency of the person" [14]. A year later, Matiegka published what is likely the seminal paper describing anthropometric measurement of skeletal muscle mass and three other functional body compartments [15]. Matiegka's system considered body weight (W) the sum of four components,
