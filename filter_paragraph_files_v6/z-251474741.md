(p28.0) It is important to remark that the inflammatory profile of LDX has not been evaluated in an ADHD context. It has been assessed in ADHD comorbid disease, such as bipolar disorder in animal models [160], in which LDX increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-6, and also the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in the frontal cortex, striatum and serum [160,198]. However, a recent study did not show LDX having an effect on IL-10 (antiinflammatory cytokine, upregulated to control the inflammatory response duration and intensity) neither on TNFa nor on IL-1b (proinflammatory cytokines) [199]. On the other hand, MAOA inhibition and TAAR1 activation by LDX (both direct targets of LDX) might influence MAPK3 activation, which is crucial for the downstream modulation of a large number of proteins involved in many biological processes, such as neuroinflammation [200]. MAPK3 can induce the expression of some antiinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-2, IL-10), downregulated in patients with ADHD, via NFjB (NFKB1) activation [200][201][202].
