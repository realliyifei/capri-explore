(p12.0) By sequencing EWS at the genome, epigenome and transcriptome level, an atlas can be created which would help to fundamentally understand EWS and help to identify important nodes as therapeutic candidates. The EWSR1-ETS translocation is the characteristic pathognomonic alteration found in all tumors so far. The fusion protein act as a strong transforming oncogene and, in experimental conditions, the transfection of cells with normal cellular backgrounds rather leads to oncogene-induced apoptosis than to transformation. Recent studies, however, showed that stem cells from young individuals with the necessary permissive background did form tumors, pointing towards the importance of epigenetic controlling in cellular/tissue differentiation in providing the necessary niche for the transformation [19,22,25,38]. Therefore, mapping these genomic and functional genomic alterations can lead to identification of the cell of origin, improvements in prediction of clinical outcome, and discovery of novel therapeutic targets. These prospects have led to numerous, independent investigations using various approaches related to OMICs.
