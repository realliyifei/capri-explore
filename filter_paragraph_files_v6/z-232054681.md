(p0.0) In the face of a rapidly growing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a high transmissibility and no cure or vaccine, many governments around the world adopted sweeping and unprecedented nonpharmaceutical measures. These measures were adopted largely without robust prior evidence regarding their population-level effectiveness and societal implications of their implementation. Most studies conducted after COVID-19 containment and mitigation measures were already implemented have indicated that these measures might have reduced the spread of the pandemic and averted millions of potential COVID-19 deaths. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] However, these studies have covered mostly North America, Europe, and parts of Asia -which have so far been heavily affected by the pandemic compared to most African countries. Therefore, the effectiveness and sustainability of these measures at national or subnational level across Africa remains debatable.
