(p16.0) Modern mobile devices embed several sensors which may provide data to be used for KD-based biometric recognition [21], in addition to timing information. For instance, since the emergence of smartphones with touch screens, finger pressure (P) and area (A) are two of the most-commonly exploited characteristics that are used within the KD framework [22]. Similarly, the way a user holds the phone, the amount of acceleration observed while moving, the number of fingers used during typing, are all relevant information that can be used to complement and support KD-based biometric recognition in the framework of continuous authentication [23]. The Android platform categorizes the aforementioned sensors according to three classes, that is, motion sensors, position sensors, and environment sensors 2 . Additionally, the touchscreen itself has its own set of managed events. The signals which can be recorded by a mobile device through sensors belonging to such groups, and used for biometric recognition purposes analysing the users' typing behaviour, are detailed hereafter. Environment sensors are not described here since they do not collect data regarding the users' interaction with the device.
