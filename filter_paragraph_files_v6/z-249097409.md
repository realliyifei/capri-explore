(p8.0) Edge-Conditioned CNN (EC-CNN) [17] exploits edge prior information to increase the quality of segmentation output since thermal crossover and thermal sensors cause ambiguous object boundaries and imaging noise, respectively. Some gated feature-wise transform (GFT) layers are inserted into the model to embed edge information properly. The proposed model consists of an edge extractor (Ed-geNet), EC-CNN blocks, and a DeepLabV3 [5] based semantic segmentation network. As an edge extractor, HED (Holistically-nested Edge Detection) [34] is employed to obtain high-quality edge information. However, there is no thermal dataset with edge annotations; the RGB dataset was used for HED training. Even though HED is trained on an RGB dataset with ground truth edge annotations, the edge results of thermal images are quite successful. EC-CNN blocks consist of convolutional layers and GFT layers to guide the segmentation of the input image by using the output of the EdgeNet. Also, the DeepLabV3 model employs ResNet as feature extractor and atrous convolutions, whereas some ResNet blocks are replaced with EC-CNN block to embed edge prior.
