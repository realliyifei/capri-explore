## (s7) Database Searching
Number of References: 5

(p7.0) In the search step, sequences (either reads or contigs) are matched to a reference database. Twenty-six of the workflows we found search with the well-known BLAST algorithms BLASTn or BLASTx (Altschul et al., 1990; Table 2). Other oftenused programs are Bowtie (Langmead, 2010;Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), and Diamond (Buchfink et al., 2015). These programs rely on alignments to a reference database and report matched sequences with alignment scores. Bowtie and BWA, which are also popular programs for the filtering step, align nucleotide sequences exclusively.
