(p9.0) Difference hierarchies of regular languages form an appealing measure of complexity. They can be studied from the viewpoint of descriptive set theory and automata theory [11] or from an algebraic perspective, as presented in this paper. It would be interesting to compare these two approaches. The results proposed by Glasser, Schmitz and Selivanov [11], together with our new result on group languages, give hope that more decidability results might be obtained in a near future. In particular, the recent progress on concatenation hierarchies [21,23,24], might lead to new decidability results for the difference hierarchies induced by the lower levels of the Straubing-Th√©rien hierarchy.
