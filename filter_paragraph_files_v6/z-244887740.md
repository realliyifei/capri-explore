(p1.0) The term 'karst' refers to regions that typically developed from carbonate rocks. These rocks mainly include mineral calcite (CaCO 3 ) and mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 ), containing limestone and dolomite rock or dolostone, respectively (Hartmann 2015). Carbonate bedrock regions represent 14% of Earth's continental surface, including broad swaths of southwestern China. The southwestern China karst region is one of the largest globally continuous karst areas, covering ∼540 Â 10 3 km 2 over eight provinces (Zhang et al. 2020). Carbonate karst aquifers are severed as the drinking water source for about one-quarter of the global population (Ford & Williams 1989).
