## (s26) Discussion
(p26.0) On the molecular level, many XEs are known to be structurally related to the steroid hormones produced by the human body (structural similarity to the natural estrogens). Therefore, they have estrogenicity or antiestroginecity and can be bound with the receptors of the organism, manipulating differentiation and modulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cytokine production, and cell cycle progression, which should have been controlled over by the endogenous 17Î²-estradiol [3,6]. On the other hand, some substances, such as Cd, PCB and dioxin, can function as potential endocrine disruptors despite no structural similarity to the natural estrogens. However, the exact mechanism by which this metal Cd may interfere with the reproductive system has not been fully elucidated. The interruption in the steroidogenic pathway by Cd toxic action may be explained in a few different ways [175]. The changes in E2 and progesterone levels may result from the impairment of steroidogenic enzymatic activities by Cd. Under the actions of Cd, conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is supposed to be the cause of abnormalities in the metabolism of sex hormones. Thus, endocrine disruptors, including Cd, PCB and dioxin, can exert effects via various pathways other than classical ER-signaling.
