## (s28) Transfer Learning
(p28.0) One of the challenges of transfer learning (colearning) is that machine learning models are based on the assumption that both training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, such an assumption does not hold when transferring knowledge between different robots or sensor modalities. A possible solution is domain adaptation, a.k.a. transfer learning, (e.g., Daum√© III and Marcu, 2006;Wang and Deng, 2018). Here, training samples from a source dataset are adapted to fit a target distribution.
