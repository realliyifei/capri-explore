## (s10) Conclusion
(p10.0) Radiation therapy remains a secondary therapy when surgery is not an option.

(p10.1) Several facts have emerged. Local control of brain metastases does not translate into increased survival, although there may be long-term survivors in the RTOG RPA Class 1. Stereotactic radiosurgery with or without whole brain radiation is appropriate in the treatment of patients with 1-3 metastasis. Whole brain radiation when combined with SRS may have long-term deleterious effects on neuro-cognition. In combination with the newer immunomodulators, WBRT and/or SRS therapy may improve the usefulness of radiation [35].

(p10.2) The main three questions that remain to be answered regarding the treatment of metastatic brain disease focus on avoidance of toxicity from brain radiation through tissue sparing and dose reduction.

(p10.3) Can hippocampal sparing help avoid neurocognitive deficits? Will the development of novel radiosensitizers allow the use of lower doses of radiation and still achieve strong immune modulation? Can more sensitive MRI better define the extent of cancer metastases in the CNS and obviate the need for whole brain radiation in SCLC and ALL subjects.
