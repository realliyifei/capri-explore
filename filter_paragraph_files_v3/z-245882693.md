## (s34) Autonomy
(p34.0) As a characteristic of VBHC, professionals experienced reduced autonomy due to the felt pressure to abide by pathways (73).

(p34.1) As an environmental demand, professionals described being deprived of their autonomy due to rapid implementation of VBHC (24). Additionally, two studies reported on autonomy of professionals being purposefully adjusted in VBHC. One study increased professionals' autonomy to advance VBHC. In this study professionals were authorized to select their own performance metrics (23). In another study, autonomy of junior residents was reduced as they were seen as potential providers of lower value care and hence in need of guidance and limits (57).
