## (s5) Mother during pregnancy with Covid19
(p5.0) It is recommended that pregnant women with suspected respiratory illness be transferred to a single room immediately after being visited by a doctor, medical examinations be minimized, and patients be kept at home as much as possible. In special cases, doctors recommend preterm delivery. In such cases, corticosteroids are recommended by doctors to accelerate fetal lung maturation. Examination of fetal heart rate using ultrasound or electrical procedures should be monitored regularly according to fetal age. Contamination of immune fluid with COVID-19 infection in an infected mother is usually not examined unless in special circumstances [18,19] . COVID-19 infection is associated with cytokine storms, which are associated with increased IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, GIFN, inflammatory MQ1, and Î± TNF levels.
