## (s8) Causation-based methods
(p8.0) The methods we have discussed so far are limited to identifying neurons that have learned the encoded concepts. They do not inherently reflect their importance towards the model's performance. Causation-based methods identify neurons with respect to model's prediction.

(p8.1) Ablation The central idea behind ablation is to notice the affect of a neuron on model's performance by varying its value. This is done either by clamping its value to zero or a fixed value and observe the change in network's performance. Ablation has been effectively used to find i) salient neurons with respect to a model (unsupervised), ii) salient neurons with respect to a particular output class in the network (supervised). The former identifies neurons that incur a large drop in model's performance when ablated (Li et al., 2016a). The latter selects neurons that cause the model to flip its prediction with respect to a certain class (Lakretz et al., 2019). Here, the output class serves as the concept against which we want to find the salient neurons.
