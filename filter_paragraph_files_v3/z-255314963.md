## (s1) Oxygen levels and carbon dioxide retention in patients with COPD
(p1.0) CO 2 and O 2 are the gases exchanged between the blood and the inhaled air during respiration, with CO 2 diffusing approximately 20 times faster than O 2 . The exchange of gases is compromised in COPD because of the destroyed airways and lung tissue, which appears as the ventilation/perfusion ratio (V/Q) mismatch. As a consequence of respiratory failure, either only the PaO 2 is decreased, or both the PaO 2 and PaCO 2 are abnormal (low PaO 2 -hypoxemia, high PaCO 2hypercapnia).

(p1.1) The gold standard for obtained blood-gas partial pressures and saturations is the arterial blood gas test (ABG), which involves taking an arterial blood sample and is therefore invasive. Oxygen levels are routinely measured noninvasively by pulse oximetry, which provides continuous peripheral O 2 saturation (SpO 2 ). The SpO 2 is usually approximately equal to the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) that is obtained by ABG (the typical difference is < 2% [31]). The SaO 2 and PaO 2 are directly related through the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC), which is not fixed and can vary even for the same person, not only depending on the temperature, PaCO 2 , and pH but also depending on some pathological conditions [31]. On the other hand, PaCO 2 is routinely estimated noninvasively from the exhaled breath (end-tidal CO 2 pressure (PetCO 2 )).

(p40.0) CO 2 and O 2 are the gases exchanged between the blood and the inhaled air during respiration, with CO 2 diffusing approximately 20 times faster than O 2 . The exchange of gases is compromised in COPD because of the destroyed airways and lung tissue, which appears as the ventilation/perfusion ratio (V/Q) mismatch. As a consequence of respiratory failure, either only the PaO 2 is decreased, or both the PaO 2 and PaCO 2 are abnormal (low PaO 2 -hypoxemia, high PaCO 2hypercapnia).

(p40.1) The gold standard for obtained blood-gas partial pressures and saturations is the arterial blood gas test (ABG), which involves taking an arterial blood sample and is therefore invasive.
