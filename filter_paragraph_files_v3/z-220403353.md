## (s4) V. SPECTRUM BROADCAST STRUCTURES (SBS)
(p4.0) In [4,5] another approach to the objectivity problem was taken. Instead of using somewhat classically motivated conditions for redundant information proliferation, the authors formalized Def. 1 and surprisingly were able to derive a unique state structure compatible with it. I will repat the process below, generalizing it compared to the original derivation [5] Let us look at the phrase 'finding out of the state of S by many independent observers' of Def. 1. First of all, the 'state of the system' is understood as one of the eigenstates |i of the reduced density matrix of the system:

(p4.1) Thus what we are trying to make objective is |i , or more precisely its index i, since when talking about objectivity of a certain property, i.e. position or momentum, we should first of all know which property we are talking about. Then 'finding out [...] by many independent observers' is formalized as observers performing uncorrelated von Neumann measurements, {Π k i k }, on their respective subsystems E k . Note that the number of observers need not be specified at all and is in a sense a 'free parameter'. Common sense says that at least two as for one observer everything is objective by definition. A notation remark: The subscript k enumerates here the environment subsystems so that Π k i k is a projector acting in the space of E k and corresponding to the result i k . Von Neumann measurements are chosen over generalized ones as the most informative (due to their orthogonality property).
