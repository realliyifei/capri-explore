## (s5) Telediagnosis
(p5.0) The main goal is to obtain good quality records outside the sleep lab, to avoid long waiting lists at laboratories 13 .

(p5.1) Polygraph tests (RP): the use of home-based devices allowing for deferred data transmission is a possibility. Borsini et al. (2016) 14 showed a 4 to 12% failure rate and the need for lab tests. This has shown that it is possible to deploy a decentralization strategy and to receive data promptly after recording. Always keeping in mind that type III studies, as RPs have a 64 to 100% sensitivity and a 41 to 100% specificity. Depending on the device, these features will enable us to set limitations to the method 15 .
