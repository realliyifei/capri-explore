(p23.0) Debunking characteristics. Once false information spreads, attempts are made to debunk it and limit its spread. Recent research has shown that there is a significant time delay between the spread and its debunking. Zubiaga et al. [121] found that true information tends to be resolved faster than false information, which tends to take about 14 hours to be debunked. Shao et al. [86] came to a similar conclusion-they found a delay of 10-20 hours between the start of a rumor and sharing of its fact-checking contents.
