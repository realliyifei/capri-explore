## (s2) Trajectory data sources
(p2.0) There are many different types of trajectory data in realworld scenarios.Zheng [11] classified trajectory data as being either actively or passively recorded, depending on the derivation of trajectories.We briefly introduce these two types of trajectory data below.

(p2.1) Active recording trajectory data: People actively record their locations when they login to social networks or travel to places of interest and share their life experiences.Typical data types include check-in data (e.g., Twitter, Weibo, QQ, etc.), and location-based data such as travel photos.

(p2.2) Figure 1 shows the correlation of users and locations in social networks.In Flickr, a sufficient number of geotagged photos can be formulated Fig. 1 User-location graph for a Location-Based Social Network (LBSN), comprising user and location correlations [14] .

(p2.3) as a trajectory, whereby each photo is associated with a location tag and a time stamp.Due to the random behaviors of users, active recording data is typically characterized by its sparsity.

(p2.4) When mining this trajectory data, additional social information is usually added.

(p2.5) Passive recording trajectory data: With the development of positioning techniques, many moving objects are equipped with positioning position devices that record location information.These include global positioning systems GPS in vehicles and radiofrequency identification devices for tracing objects.Typically, these devices automatically record huge volumes of trajectory data points [12,13] .Transaction records or the Internet trajectory of human beings can also be viewed as trajectory data, since locations and times are recorded.
