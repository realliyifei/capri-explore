## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) To control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many governments began implementing containment measures in the hopes of limiting the spread of the virus, reducing the burdens on healthcare systems, and minimizing the death toll.Although some countries (like Sweden) turned toward a more laissez-faire herd immunity approach, others adopted containment measures, known as nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).Unlike pharmaceutical interventions, such as medication and vaccination, 1 NPIs aim at limiting mobility and reducing contact to mitigate the severity of a virus' impact; these range from measures that seek to curb transmissions (i.e., closing of public spaces, gathering bans, masking requirements) to stricter mandates that impose restrictions on personal liberties (i.e., shelter-inplace orders [SIPOs], curfews).

(p0.1) During the first wave (January 2020−June 2020), the unprecedented rapid spread of COVID-19 sparked varied responses from around the world-each country was reacting in a way that they believed to be most effective.Still, there is much debate as to which NPIs are most impactful in mitigating the COVID-19 burden on related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.This information can be extremely valuable to policy makers and government officials facing future waves of the pandemic and other viral outbreaks.

(p0.2) One literature review by Herby and colleagues 2 sought to address these issues by analyzing the effects of various NPIs on mortality during the first wave, ultimately concluding that they are not an effective way of reducing mortality rates during a pandemic.Although this may be the case, the authors looked to extend their research by including 2 additional variables that may have influenced the government responses: cases and hospitalizations.Although deaths are the most extreme of the 3 variables, infections and hospital capacities were being monitored throughout the pandemic, and their progression following the imposed measures should not be overlooked.Mendez-Brito and colleagues 3 studied the association between 15 NPIs and COVID-19 health outcomes; however, their analyses used the proportion of papers that found these measures to be mitigative, rather than the proportion of cases, hospitalizations, or deaths averted.Ge et al. 4 studied the effects of various NPIs on transmission across waves.As time went on, governments and the public became more experienced in transmission mitigation, therefore their paper may have captured some behavioral aspects that cannot be fully attributed to the NPIs themselves.In their review, Patiño-Lugo and colleagues 5 studied the roles of various NPIs containing the virus, and although they did acknowledge cases, mortality, and the hospital burden, they did not quantify how effective NPIs were in mitigating these outcomes.Estimating the effects of NPIs does present some challenges: the literature differs not only in the methodology used, but also in the way that effectiveness is reported, making it difficult to compare findings across studies.In contrast to Herby et al., 2 who converted findings from the literature into common percentage estimates, this review grouped studies by the metrics used for reporting to compare like results.This allowed the review to consider articles that were excluded from that of Herby and colleagues, 2 namely those studying growth rates and per capita effects.

(p0.3) In this paper, the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effects of 10 NPIs on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and mortality (Table 1) to determine which measures were most effective in mitigating the pandemic's burden on health outcomes during the first wave.This research extends the previous literature by analyzing these output variables across 3 reporting metrics (cumulative, growth rate, and per capita effects) at 3 points in time (2, 3, and ≥4 weeks after NPI implementation).In none of the reviews the authors consulted considered time lags.Relevant articles were obtained through an extensive search and selective screening process that refined the sample to just qualified papers.Once complete, the articles were assessed individually, and the estimated effects of NPIs were collected from the available material.
