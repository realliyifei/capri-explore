## (s6) Cue phrase
(p6.0) The number of cues Words that are frequently used in the name of hotels, such as "ÛAEë" (hotel) or "Å(" (Japanese inn). 9 Component words for accommodations, such as "ÕíóÈ" (front desk) or "¢¤" (guest room).

(p6.1) 29 Words that are frequently used when tourists stay in accommodation, such as "Ê‹" (stay) or "Á §Ã¯¤ó" (check in).

(p6.2) 14 Other words. 21 Based on this method, Ishino et al. constructed a travel link search system. 6 The system generated a list of URLs for Web sites related to a location, and automatically identified link types and the context of citations ("citing areas"), where the blog authors described the sites. Figure 3 shows a list of links related to "'*" (Osaka).

(p6.3) The number of cues Words that are frequently used in the name of hotels, such as "ÛAEë" (hotel) or "Å(" (Japanese inn). 9 Component words for accommodations, such as "ÕíóÈ" (front desk) or "¢¤" (guest room).

(p6.4) 29 Words that are frequently used when tourists stay in accommodation, such as "Ê‹" (stay) or "Á §Ã¯¤ó" (check in).

(p6.5) 14 Other words. 21 Based on this method, Ishino et al. constructed a travel link search system. 6 The system generated a list of URLs for Web sites related to a location, and automatically identified link types and the context of citations ("citing areas"), where the blog authors described the sites.

## (s14) (TIME):
(p14.0) The word is an expression related to time, such as " " (minute) or "B"" (hour): 77.

(p14.1) They also constructed a visualization of transportation information, which is shown in Figure  4. In this figure, each arrow indicates a link from a departure place to a destination. In addition to arrows, transportation methods, such as trains or buses, are shown as icons.

(p14.2) Transportation information can also be extracted from texts written in English. Davidov [6] presented an algorithm framework that enables automated acquisition of map-link information from the Web, based on linguistic patterns such as "from X to". Given a set of locations as initial seeds, he retrieved an extended set of locations from the Web, and produced a map-link network that connected these locations using edges showing the transportation type.

(p14.3) The word is an expression related to time, such as " " (minute) or "B"" (hour): 77.
