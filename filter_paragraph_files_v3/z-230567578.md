## (s14) Neural Networks and fuzzy
(p14.0) In 2010, Arvinder, et al. [15] assessed and compared the application of various soft computing methods: Feed Forward Back propagation Neural Networks (FBNN), Radial Basis Function(RBF) Neural Network, Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to build Effort prediction models for Software Maintenance. Maintenance effort data for two commercial products of the software was utilized. In this work, the effort of the maintenance was the dependent variable while eight metrics of Object-Oriented represented the independent variables. It was observed that the techniques of soft computing can be utilized for building precise models for maintenance effort prediction of the software and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System technique provides the most precise model based on the outcomes of MARE, MRE, p-value, and r metrics

(p14.1) In 2014, a study conducted by Momeni and Shiva [16], this study has shown that when compared Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) with other models like Fuzzy Logic, the ANFIS can give more precisely predict maintainability. For this, four metrics (CAE, CDA, CFA, and WOM) were selected. Four parameters were used for measuring the output: CAE is the first input parameter, which displays the aspects' number including advice produced through the operations' implementation in a specified module. It was utilized for measuring the operation's dependence on the advice; so modifying in the advice maybe affect the operation. For this metric, a greater value of a specified module refers to the last is coupled with extra aspects. CDA is the second input parameter that displays the modules' number which is affected by point cuts and introductions in a particular aspect. This measures the modules' number that is impacted by an aspect. The third input parameter is CFA which displays the modules' number that has fields that are called by a particular module. It measures the coupling among modules depends on on-field access. A greater value of CFA indicates tight coupling among the modules which implies complication, decrease in the testability, and also increase in the module being fault-prone. The last parameter is WOM which displays the operations' number (methods or advice) in a module. This is equal to the WMC (weighted operations per class) of the CK metrics. A class is considered to be more complex when it has greater operations numbers the operations' complexity is considered to be equal. Also, with a greater WOM value, additional effort is required for testing a class. A lower value of the WOM is desired for each module. These metrics were utilized for validation, testing, and training [16].
