## (s2) Literature search and selection criteria
(p2.0) From the beginning of the databases up to April 2023, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science.The search strategy employed a combination of keywords related to "acetylcysteine, " "N-acetylcysteine, " "contrastinduced nephropathy, " "contrast-induced acute kidney injury, " "metaanalysis, " and "randomized controlled trial." A full list of search terms is available in Supplementary Table S1.Additional relevant studies were identified by manually searching the reference lists of eligible papers.We did not apply any language restrictions.

(p2.1) We included studies that met the following criteria: they were meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials that examined the association between NAC use and contrast-induced nephropathy, with no restrictions on comparators or populations.If multiple meta-analyses were available for the same research topic, we selected the one with the largest dataset, as previously described elsewhere (16,17).We excluded articles without complete text, reviews, meta-analyses of studies with different study designs, and those without a control group.

(p2.2) Two independent reviewers (R.Zhu.and B.D.) screened the titles and abstracts of the articles, followed by a full-text evaluation of potentially eligible articles.Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (P.L.).
