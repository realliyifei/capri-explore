## (s12) Chromium and Cobalt Alloys
(p12.0) Despite strategic importance and widespread use, chromium was not included in the CRMs lists released in 2011 and 2017. The main chromium producers are South Africa (producing about two-fifths of the chromite ores and concentrates), together with Kazakhstan (producing one-third of Cr). India, Russia, and Turkey are also substantial producers of Cr.

(p12.1) Significant chromium demand comes for the production of iron-based alloys. As one of the major alloying elements in stainless steel, Cr content ranges between mass fractions of 10.5% and 30% [13]. Owing to its strong reactivity with oxygen, it provides the ability to passivate the surface by an adherent, insoluble, ultrathin layer that protects the underlying metal against attacks of the corrosive agents, mainly acids and/or chloride-containing environments. Cr is also responsible for surface self-healing in presence of oxygen [13].
