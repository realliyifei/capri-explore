## (s6) Structure of SARS
(p6.0) Genome of SARS-CoV includes 29,727 nucleotides (in length) having 11 ORFs. These include 1) specified location and number of small open reading frames, 2) having 1 copy of Polypro, and 3) short anchoring of S protein. Figure 2a gives the systematic representation of genome organization of SARS. Spike glycoprotein of this virus is a membranous protein (type 1) and makes a trimer formation. It usually has a transmembranous segment which helps the trimer to anchor the viral membrane. Further, ectodomain plays a role in decorating its virion surface. On the cell surface of the host, it mostly binds to ACE2 enzyme (receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) which is a receptor present on the host's surface resulting in membrane fusion, while undergoing various rearrangements related to the structure [15]. This glycoprotein is reported to be glycosylated heavily with each promotor having glycosylation sites (22N linked) [30]. Various studies regarding the initial analysis of the strain (Wuhan-Hu-1) which outbreaks confirmed to be amino acid residues (1273), with N-terminus signal peptide, binding receptor fragment S1 as well as S2 (fusion fragment) in it. Moreover, S1 is further divided into a huge number of domains, such as NTD, CTD1, CTD2 and RBD (N-terminal domain, Cterminal domains 1 and 2 and receptor binding domain).
## (s12) Structure and Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
(p12.0) Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory syndrome and dromedary camels are known to be their initial source of origin. As far as its  [75]. During encountering targeted cells or viral biogenesis, the cleavage of MERS coronavirus occurs at junction point found in between subunits (S1 and S2) [76]. Moreover, the 2 nd cleavage site S2 is processed on onseting of fusion of membrane and is found in S2 subunit upstream of fusion peptide. Both of these cleavage sites enhanced chances of viral entry and in modulation of cell tropism and host range [77].
