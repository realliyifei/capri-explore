## (s7) Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia (CAMT)
(p7.0) This is a rare bone marrow failure that presents at birth as hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia without any other physical characteristics. Most affected individuals develop additional cytopenias during childhood until finally progressing to bone marrow aplasia.

(p7.1) This autosomal recessive disorder is caused by mutations in the c-MPL gene that provoke the expression of a dysfunctional thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor. There is a correlation between genotype and phenotype, such that the nonsense mutations display a more aggressive pattern with progression to hypocellular bone marrow within the first decade of life, whereas patients with amino acid substitution mutations can exhibit moderate decrease in platelet counts and later go on to develop anemia or pancytopenia. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only curative option for these patients [9].

(p7.2) A few cases (five unrelated families) have recently been identified with very similar clinical symptoms caused by biallelic mutations on the THPO gene that encodes TPO, leading to absent and/or dysfunctional circulating TPO [13]. Unlike patients with c-MPL mutations, individuals with molecular pathology in THPO fail to respond to allo-HSCT, given that the defect is extrinsic to the hematopoietic cells. In contrast, in these cases, administering thrombopoietic agents such as romiplostim, a TPO receptor agonist (TPO-RA) does induce trilinear hematopoietic responses, remission of bleeding and infections, and transfusion independence. On the other hand, the monoallelic mutations that result in loss of function, determine decreased circulating TPO and mild thrombocytopenia with autosomal dominant inheritance [12].
