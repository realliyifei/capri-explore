## (s5) Clinical Outcomes
(p5.0) There are two prominent features that have been observed in severe and critical COVID-19 patients: the progressive rise of inflammation, and an uncommon trend of hypercoagulation (W. Cao & Li, 2020). Clinical studies report additional characteristics, such as high venous thromboembolism rates, elevated D-dimer levels, high fibrinogen levels, low anti-thrombin levels, and pulmonary congestion with microvascular thrombosis. High rates of central line thrombosis and vascular occlusive events, such as Ischemic limbs, strokes were observed in patients with COVID-19 (Kuba et al., 2005;.

(p5.1) The initial report of clinical outcomes from a severe COVID-19 case revealed pulmonary bilateral diffuse alveolar destruction with cellular fibro myxoid exudates (Z. . It showed clear apparent desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation in the right lung which implies acute respiratory distress syndrome.
