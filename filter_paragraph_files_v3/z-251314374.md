## (s15) Denosumab
(p15.0) Denosumab is a recently developed antiresorptive drug. It acts on OPG produced by osteoblasts and is considered to be an anti-RANKL antibody (Shibahara, 2019). It functions to reduce the resorption of bone by inhibiting RANKL/RANK binding, thereby dysregulating the formation, differentiation, and osteoclast survival rate (Shibahara, 2019).

(p15.1) Denosumab has a short effect on bone, unlike the effects of bisphosphonates, because of its short half-life. Such RANKL inhibitors do not bind with bone and are generally eliminated within six months of cessation of treatment (Ruggiero et al., 2014).
