## (s3) Genetic Susceptibility to COVID-19 Infection
(p3.0) In the case of COVID-19, what is controversial for researchers and clinicians is that not all COVID-19 exposed people are infected and not all infected patients develop severe respiratory complications. Although the exact mechanisms behind these dramatically different infection outcomes remain to be elucidated, it is quite likely that these disparities are genetically mediated, in part [22].

(p3.1) For entering into the host cells, many viruses use multiple alternative receptors. The study by Lu et al. showed that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have similar receptor binding domain structures. Further studies showed that these viruses use the same receptor for entering the cells. This receptor is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and is involved in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [12], [23].
