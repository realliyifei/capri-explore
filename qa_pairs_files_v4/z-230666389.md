## (s3) Breastfeeding
(p3.0) The establishment of the microbiome in childhood is important for its microbialimmune crosstalk that is thought to be involved in the pathobiology of disease later in life [37]. A longitudinal study demonstrated that after an early developmental and transitional phase in gut microbial composition, a period of microbial stability is reached by as early as 31 months [38]. The most significant factor associated with the early microbial structure is whether or not an individual was breastfed, and it also appears that this is a significant risk factor for the development of IBD. A recent meta-analysis found that breastfeeding (BF) was protective against the development of both forms of IBD, reducing the risk of developing CD (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.85) and UC (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91) [39]. This protective effect was accentuated if the duration of breastfeeding was greater than 12 months.
## (s4) Dietary Fibre
(p4.0) Dietary fibre provides a substrate for the bacteria that inhabit the distal gut, and these bacteria are integral to its handling. Humans produce approximately 17 enzymes to digest fibre. However, these bacteria produce thousands of complementary enzymes to depolymerise and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host absorbable SCFAs. These SCFAs include butyrate, propionate and acetate. Bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum that possess this capability are less abundant in the gut of IBD patients [26]. The IBD-altered microbiota composition results in lower production of anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory metabolites, in particular butyrate, a lack of which may contribute to increased intestinal inflammation [53].
## (s5) Dietary Fibre
(p5.0) Dietary fibre provides a substrate for the bacteria that inhabit the distal gut, and these bacteria are integral to its handling. Humans produce approximately 17 enzymes to digest fibre. However, these bacteria produce thousands of complementary enzymes to depolymerise and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host absorbable short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These SCFAs include butyrate, propionate and acetate. Bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum that possess this capability are less abundant in the gut of IBD patients [26]. The IBD-altered microbiota composition results in lower production of anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory metabolites, in particular butyrate, a lack of which may contribute to increased intestinal inflammation [53].
## (s9) FODMAPs
(p9.0) Diets low in non-digestible short-chain carbohydrates (collectively known as FODMAPs) have been used with success in improving symptoms in patients with functional gut disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome [61]. A randomised, double-blind placebocontrolled study showed higher symptom scores of pain, bloating and urgency in patients with IBD and concurrent IBS challenged with FODMAPs [62]. An improvement in functional symptoms has been demonstrated in cohorts with IBD and concurrent IBS on low FODMAPs diets [63,64]. In IBD patients adhering to a low FODMAP diet, the abundance of select organisms in the stool was decreased, though overall markers of diversity and inflammation were unchanged. One recent study of 60 IBD patients in remission or with mild disease activity demonstrated an improvement in reported symptom scores as well as faecal calprotectin in the subgroup on a low FODMAPs diet compared with a standard diet, though this finding is yet to be replicated [65].
## (s15) Zinc
(p15.0) In rodent models, oral supplementation with zinc has been shown to decrease severity of colitis as well as activity of the myeloperoxidase enzyme (enzyme found in neutrophils and monocytes) when combined with anti-TNF α or as a sole intervention [80,81]. The proposed mechanism was via alterations in TNF receptor expression and flow-on effects to the innate immune response. In mouse and human models of macrophage activity, intracellular zinc enhanced bacterial clearance via autophagy [82]. Data from the Nurses Health Study I and II were combined and food frequency questionnaires on 170,776 women with a follow-up period of 26 years were examined [47]. There was an inverse association between intake of dietary zinc (food sources include meat, fish, cereal and dairy [83] and development of CD, but not UC. Zinc intake has been found to be lower in a Crohn's disease population compared to healthy controls and lower serum zinc levels have been associated with poorer outcomes such as hospitalization and surgery in both forms of disease [84,85]. Interventional studies examining dietary zinc intake and impact on disease outcomes are lacking.
## (s19) Mediterranean Style Diet
(p19.0) A recent prospective cohort study examined the relationship between consumption of a Mediterranean diet (high in fruit, vegetables, PUFA and protein predominately from fish, legumes and nuts) and the risk of developing CD in a prospective cohort study of 83,147 Swedish adults [52]. They found a dose-effect relationship, with those most adherent to the Mediterranean diet having a lower risk of developing CD. A study examined the dietary intake of 39,511 young women during high school and subsequent development of IBD over 19 year follow up. They found that compared to women who consumed <10 g/day of fish during high school, those with an intake of ≥30 g/day had a 57% lower risk of CD [46]. Fish intake did not appear to modulate UC risk.
## (s22) Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN)
(p22.0) Dietary food components may contribute to the inflammatory processes during a flare of IBD. EEN is an elemental diet, which involves the provision of 100% of a person's nutritional requirement as a liquid nutrition formula delivered enterally (either orally or via nasogastric tube) over a period of 6-8 weeks [149]. The mechanism of its efficacy is still poorly understood. However, there are changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome [150]. EEN significantly decreases the gut bacterial diversity below pretreatment levels. One theory is that the bowel rest induced by EEN facilitates mucosal healing by limiting the activity of pathogenic microbes [149]. EEN has been found to be particularly beneficial in the paediatric setting and in CD rather than UC. A randomised controlled trial that looked at both clinical remission and mucosal healing at week 10 in a paediatric CD population comparing EEN and oral corticosteroids showed equivalent rates of clinical remission and superior rates of mucosal healing in the EEN group [143]. Studies looking at the utility of EEN in the adult IBD population have yielded less dramatic benefits. Meta-analyses on the topic have suggested that there is weak evidence of the benefit of EEN for the induction and maintenance of IBD remission compared to placebo in adult patients with CD, but not compared to corticosteroids [151,152]. One of the main barriers to efficacy is patient adherence to EEN therapy [144].
