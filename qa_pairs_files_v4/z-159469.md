## (s8) Cell Surface Protein Interaction
(p8.0) It is well established that membrane receptors may dimerize to regulate the activity of each member of the dimer or to work cooperatively to bind ligand on one receptor while mediating intracellular signaling through the other. In 2004, the Pin lab pioneered the work demonstrating the application of HTRF in studying dimerization of glutamate and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors [51]. In this study, anti-tag (Flag, HA, and 6-His) antibodies labeled with donor Eu cryptate and acceptor AlexaFluor 647 or XL665 were used to generate fluorescent signals. The mechanism of this dimerization was further pursued by HTRF technology [29]. Recently, the application of HTRF on GPCR oligomerization and receptor-ligand binding was further expanded with SNAP-Tag technology as mentioned above [30] (and data not shown). The Pin lab later conducted a series of studies using HTRF to demonstrate the dimerization of other GPCRs, such as metabotropic glutamate-like receptors (mGluR) [28,52], vasopressin and oxytocin receptors [53]. Ciruela et al. developed an HTRF assay to measure the heterodimerization of adenosine A 1 receptors (A 1 Rs) and A 2 A receptors (A 2 ARs), revealing a more precise modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission by adenosine [26]. The human hemagglutinin (HA)-A 2 AR and Flag-A 1 R constructs were generated and transiently transfected into HEK cells. The level of heterodimerization of the receptors was reflected through the FRET generated when Eu-labeled anti-Flag antibody and XL665-labeled anti-HA antibody were incubated with these transfected cells [26].
