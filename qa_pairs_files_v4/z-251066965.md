## (s8) B. Selective Zooming and Skipping
(p8.0) Selective zooming and skipping (SZS) methods take a more efficient approach to cutting into patches by only zooming into regions of the input image that are important. The zoom level may differ across different patches, and some patches may be entirely skipped. Reinforced Auto-Zoom Net (RAZN) [78] uses reinforcement learning to determine where to zoom in WSIs for the task of breast cancer segmentation. RAZN assumes the zoom-in action can be performed at most m times and the zooming rate is a constant r. At each zoom level i, there is a different segmentation network f θi and a different policy network g θi . Initially, policy network g θ0 takes a cropped image x 0 ∈ R H×W ×3 as input and determines whether to zoom-in or to break. If there is no need to zoom in, x 0 is given as input to segmentation network f θ0 which produces the output, otherwise, a higher-resolution imagex 0 ∈ R rH×rW ×3 is sampled from the same area and will be cut into r 2 patches of size H × W × 3. Each patch is then given to policy network g θ1 and this process is recursively repeated until all policy networks break or the maximum zoom level is reached. RAZN achieves an improved performance over other stateof-the-art methods while reducing the inference time by a factor of ∼2. Similarly, the methods in [79] and [80] use reinforcement learning for efficient object detection and aerial image classification, respectively.
