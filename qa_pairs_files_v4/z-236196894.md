## (s1) Maturation
(p1.0) Biofilms are rarely formed by one bacterial strain and are instead a balanced community of several species. This phase is characterized by the secretion of the biofilm glycocalyx, which structures its final morphology [27]. This glycocalyx acts as an anchoring system and provides stability and protection from the host's immune system. It is mainly anionic, composed of bacterial exopolysaccharides with long molecular chains of 0,5-2*10^6Da, and helps to entrap minerals and nutrients from the surrounding environment [28]. The glycocalyx is a crucial part of biofilm function. Colonies that produce it can host neighboring colonies with species that cannot do so inside the same biofilm [29]. These colonies communicate through interstitial voids (water channels) in which nutrients, signaling molecules, and extracellular DNA circulate [30]. Those signaling molecules and DNA exchange constitute the trans-colony communication (quorum sensing), which is the essential functional mechanism that gives the biofilm-embedded bacteria those special genotype and phenotype characteristics that make them unique in comparison to their homologous planktonic strains [31].
