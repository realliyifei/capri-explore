## (s4) Myogenic Differentiation of Activated Satellite Cells
(p4.0) The transition from satellite cells proliferation to differentiation involves the down-regulation of proliferativeassociated genes and the activation of specific differentiating markers, such as myogenin, neonatal isoform of myosin heavy chain (MHC), slow-twitch skeletal muscle troponin T (Tnnt1), cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle Ca 2+ -ATPase (Atp2a2), Insulin-like growth factor-2 (Igf-2), fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (Fgfr4), nicotinic cholinergic receptor alpha polypeptide 1 (Chrna1), and cardiac/slowtwitch skeletal muscle troponin C (Tncc) [63,64]. The permanent exit from the cell cycle is then ratified by the expression of p21 protein [65]. The expression of MyoD is not restricted to activated/proliferating SCs since it has been recognized as a master regulator of the myogenic program, modulating a suite of genetic and epigenetic mediators involved in myoblast differentiation ( Fig. 2B-C). For instance, it has been described that MyoD induced the expression of miRNAs promoting myoblast differentiation, as miR 206 and miR486 (Fig. 2C). When proliferating myoblasts engage the differentiative program, miR 206/486 are involved in the downmodulation of Pax7 by directly targeting the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of its gene sequence [66]. Although MyoD exerts the genetic control of myogenic factors, even its function is tightly regulated. The transcriptional activity of MyoD is known to be dependent on the association with chromatin modifiers as Baf60c, connoting the epigenetic control of its function. In this context the importance of the muscle-specific long non-coding RNA Linc-RAM it has been recently highlighted. Yu and colleagues reported that Linc-RAM can function as a transcriptional enhancer of MyoD, by promoting the formation of the MyoD-Baf60c-Brg1 complex, responsible for the expression of genes strictly required for myogenic differentiation [33]. Supporting this mechanistic model, Linc-RAM knock-out mice showed important defects in muscle regeneration due to an impaired muscle differentiation. Moreover, ChIP analysis in C2C12 myogenic cell line revealed that MyoD was significantly enriched in the promoter region of myogenin gene when Linc-RAM was over-expressed, indicating that this lncRNA can promote muscle differentiation [67]. In fact, the terminal differentiation of committed myoblasts requires the expression of both MyoD and myogenin, acting in a tightly regulated mechanism determining the expression of the myogenic regulatory factor 4 (Mrf 4), along with other markers of the terminally differentiated state [68].
