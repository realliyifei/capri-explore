## (s4) NO/NOS Influence on the Blood Brain Barrier Permeability
(p4.0) The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a structure with highly selective permeability only for certain molecules, thus protecting the brain from the toxic effects of multiple substances in the blood that result from normal metabolic processes or from inadequate clearance associated with various diseases. The protecting role of the BBB is ensured by the tight junctions between the vascular endothelial cells, a structure that can become more permeable by the action of NO as a result of its vasodilatation effects [35]. In certain situation, this effect can excessively increase the BBB permeability, allowing different molecules to permeate and subsequently undergo metabolic transformations in the brain tissue, with the formation of pathological deposits that can initiate degenerative processes and neuronal death. Simultaneously, ionic, osmotic and vasogenic cerebral edema can occur, which can also have a detrimental effect on the structure and function of the CNS [36]. nNOS may play a major role in BBB disruption [37]. For this reason, nNOS inhibitors may have beneficial effects in cerebral ischemia or in neurodegenerative processes by reducing BBB permeability. It has been suggested that the burst of both eNOS and nNOS, following acute cerebral ischemia, mediates the increase in NO production. The consequence is the occurrence of vasogenic cerebral edema with brain tissue damage [36]. The production of NO occurs in two waves, the first of which is characterized by the transient increase in NO synthesis, and the second one by an increased synthesis of NO that lasts up to 4-7 days. This increase in NO synthesis is correlated with elevated intracellular Ca 2+ levels in both waves [38,39]. The local inflammatory response, through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate iNOS, continues to generate elevated levels of NO, even if reperfusion of the ischemic tissue occurs. Thus, an inhibitor such as Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) can be employed to stop both vasodilation and BBB permeability loss [37]. On the other hand, NO and NOS inhibitors can constitute triggers for the development of focal cerebral ischemia, which with sufficient time duration can lead to neuronal death with permanent lesions and neurological dysfunctions [1,40]. Moreover, during reperfusion, excessive NO production occurs because blood flow is re-established, and with it, the supply of oxygen, and toxic radicals of oxygen and nitrogen, renewed [41]. The result is an increase in cerebral edema. That is why early inhibition of NO formation following cerebral ischemia can be a way to prevent the loss or reduce the permeability of the BBB and prevent the permeation of harmful substances in the brain tissue, which can become subsequent triggers for neurodegenerative processes. It is already known that cerebral ischemic changes that occur simultaneously with the senescence process can lead to the initiation or acceleration of pathological processes that are the basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and AD [42,43].
## (s12) S-Nitrosylation in Alzheimer's Disease
(p12.0) In sAD, a variety of proteins essential for synaptic survival and function are abnormally S-nitrosylated, causing synapse loss and neurodegeneration [6]. The Apoε gene encodes a group of lipoproteins essential for maintaining CNS cholesterol homeostasis [6,91,92]. There is evidence that Apoε4 is a significant genetic risk factor for sAD developing [6,93]. Moreover, in the human hippocampus, both Apoε2 and Apoε3 can be S-nitrosylated [6,91], as shown in an experimental cell culture study [94], which may result in altered protein conformation, decreasing its affinity for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors [6]. Samples from both cell culture and human hippocampus revealed that Apoε2 and ε3 can be S-nitrosylated, suggesting a potential role of this post-translational modification in sAD [6]. Moreover, there is an isoform-specific difference for Apoε in microglial NO production: mice expressing the Apoε4 protein isoform have a greater NO production than mice expressing the Apoε3 protein isoform, and both neurons and macrophages from Apoε4 transgenic mice exhibit a similar increase in the uptake of arginine [91]. In AD patients with the ε4 allele, increased cerebral oxidative stress has been seen [91].
## (s16) nNOS, eNOS and Cerebral Blood Flow in Alzheimer's Disease
(p16.0) Due to the extensively high energy demands coupled with the paradoxically low energy storage, the brain requires continuous and dynamically regulated blood supply in order to maintain proper function [109]. A precise and prompt blood flow control that can dynamically increase the supply to areas of intense neuronal activity is thus required. This process, named neurovascular coupling (NVC), is accomplished by the communication between active neurons and the cells that form the neurovascular compartment [110] through a multitude of molecular pathways. Among those pathways, NO plays a ubiquitous key role in the process and is essential for the development of the neurovascular response.

(p16.1) Through the formation of a supramolecular complex with NMDAR, nNOS activity becomes regulated by glutamate, through Ca 2+ intracellular influx [25]. As a result of NMDAR activation. Properly dimerized nNOS will proceed to produce NO, however, under the condition of disrupted dimerization, the enzyme catalyzes the uncoupled oxida-tion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), with the production of superoxide instead [111]. One of the noteworthy factors that can lead to reduced nNOS dimerization is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) availability, which has been noted to be reduced in AD patients [112].
