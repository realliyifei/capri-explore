## (s12) Effects of Depression in RA Patients
(p12.0) Depression in patients with RA is associated with poor long-term outcomes. Multiple studies have shown that depression in RA is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and physical disability. This alters treatment compliance, causes more comorbidities, and leads to higher mortality, partly through increased suicide risk. Depression in RA increases health service utilization and healthcare costs directly through hospitalization, but also indirectly through loss of work productivity. It also considerably decreases quality of life (QoL) for RA patients, a fact that is reflected in all domains of QoL questionnaires [41]. Additionally, psychological distress may impact health outcomes by influencing other health behaviors alongside medication adherence, such as smoking and physical activity. Reduced levels of physical activity can result in deconditioning, loss of natural endorphins, and increased pain [13].
