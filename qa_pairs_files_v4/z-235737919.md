## (s6) COVID-19 Infection
(p6.0) In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (COVID-19), a significant number of patients develop chest pain or EKG changes and are found to have an elevation of cardiac troponin suggestive of myocardial injury. In these patients, myriad potential mechanisms may account for this presentation, including myocardial injury from nonischemic mechanisms, type I AMI due to an increased propensity for plaque rupture, or type II AMI resulting from severe diffuse thrombosis, supply demand mismatch, or coronary vasospasm [32••,33, 34]. There is growing evidence that a widespread hypercoagulable state develops as a systemic manifestation of severe COVID-19 infection [35]. The data from various observational studies supports increased incidence of hypercoagulable state in these patients mainly due to increased level of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, fibrinolysis, and presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. In an autopsy study of patients dying of COVID-19, cardiac microthrombi was the most common pathological cause of myocyte necrosis and differed in composition from coronary thrombi in ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients whether they were SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative [36]. Patients with STEMI are found to have increased burden of thrombus as well. In a small observational study, it was noted that patients with STEMI and COVID-19 infection had increased incidence of MINOCA due to thrombotic occlusion and distal embolization [37]. Finally, recently published case reports and biopsy findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can cause direct infection or immune-mediated widespread inflammation of endothelial cells leading to endothelitis [38]. In patients with COVID-19, patients with coronary etiologies including MINOCA, spontaneous thrombosis, or coronary vasospasm should be distinguished from other forms of myocardial injury including myocarditis. If there is a suspicion of thrombosis, intravascular imaging with OCT or IVUS can help differentiate patients with pro-thrombotic etiologies from those with traditional atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Cardiac MR maybe helpful in distinguishing conditions causing MINOCA with nonischemic mechanisms of myocardial injury [34]. Endomyocardial biopsy is not routinely recommended, as virus and lymphocytic infiltration is very rarely observed in postmortem samples, suggesting that the yield would be low in vivo [39].
