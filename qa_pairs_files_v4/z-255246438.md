## (s3) Chitosan and Its Derivatives in Medicine
(p3.0) Due to its properties, chitosan and its derivatives can be used in the production of dressing materials, in the manufacture of drugs as a controlled-release active substance carrier, or in tissue engineering involving soft tissues, nerves, cartilage, bones, or arteries. Studies on the use of chitosan are summarized in Table 1 and studies on its derivatives are in Table 2.    Good drug delivery, non-cytotoxic to the cornea, good degradability [103] The team of Fangsong Zhang et al. [30] used two chemical agents, glutaraldehyde, genipin, and a physical agent, ultraviolet light, to crosslink nerve extracellular matrix/chitosan scaffolds. Scaffolds cross-linked with genipin were characterized by higher porosity and regular structure in contrast to scaffolds cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and UV. The degree of crosslinking for genipin-crosslinked and glutaraldehyde-crosslinked scaffolds were similar to each other. Genipin-crosslinked scaffolds had the lowest degree of cytotoxicity and the highest histocompatibility, with good mechanical properties.
