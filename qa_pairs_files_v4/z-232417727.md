## (s16) Privacy
(p16.0) Wearable sensor-based HAR systems do not suffer from severe privacy issues as camera-based vision systems. However, since HAR applications continuously capture user data and recognize user activities, they may leak users' personal information if data are not secured. Therefore, secure data sharing and safe data storage are imperative for healthcare applications. To alleviate sensitive information during model training, adversarial loss functions are leveraged to guard against privacy leakage [26]. In addition, federated learning is a promising solution, which trains a global model without exposing local devices' private data [27].
