## (s2) Mutant Isocitrate Dehydrogenases Inhibit NAD Production in Cancer
(p2.0) Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) converts isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the TCA cycle with NADP + as its cofactor. IDH exists in three isozymes, namely IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3. IDH1, located in the cytosol and peroxisome, is encoded by the IDH1 gene on chromosome 2q34, while IDH2 is localized in the mitochondria and is encoded by the gene located on chromosome 15q26.1 [41]. Both enzymes are NADP-dependent, share high degree of homology and conduct a reversible reaction to maintain the isocitrate pool [12]. Unlike the other two isozymes, IDH3, localized in the mitochondria, exists as a heterocomplex enzyme consisting of α, β, and γ subunits that are encoded by IDH3A (15q25.1), IDH3B (20p13), and IDH3C (Xq28) genes, respectively [41]. IDH3 is activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inhibited by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In order to ensure the continuity of TCA cycle, IDH3 conducts the irreversible conversion of isocitrate to maintain the α-KG pool [12,41,81].
## (s6) Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (MTHFD) Maintains NADP/NADPH Pools in Cancer
(p6.0) MTHFD2 is an enzyme that is required for tumor cell survival [104]. MTHFD2 is highly expressed in the mitochondria and nucleus of multiple types of tumor cells, but not in non-transformed cells [104]. The only non-transformed cell induction of MTHFD2 was observed in lymphocyte activation, indicating the role of MTHFD2 in normal hematopoietic cells as well as in the tumorigenesis process of hematologic malignancies [105].

(p6.1) MTHFD2 plays a significant role in the mitochondrial folate-dependent one carbon (1C) metabolism by oxidizing the 1C unit and recycling folate cofactor needed by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) [104,105]. Both reactions are highly important to ensure rapid cancer proliferation [104,105]. MTHFD2 exists as two isozymes, MTHFD2 and MTHFD2L. Both isozymes are bifunctional enzymes that are responsible for the NAD-dependent CH 2 -THF dehydrogenase and CH + -THF cyclohydrolase reactions within the mitochondria. The cytosolic counterpart, MTHFD1 is a trifunctional enzyme having dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activities. Recently another isozyme MTHFD1L, another mitochondrial enzyme was stuided in colorectal and bladder cancers, is a monofunctional enzyme that catalyses the formation of formate and THF cofactor regeneration. MTHFD1L enhanced proliferation in some cancer tissues, as knock down of MTHFD1L slowed the tumor growth [106,107].

(p6.2) The reactions catalysed by MTHFD2 and its isozyme are NAD-dependent [108]. MTHFD2 is critical in maintaining NADP/NADPH production as it showed specific redox cofactor activity with NAD and NADP [108,109]. Suppression of MTHFD2 disturbed NADPH pools and enhanced apoptosis due to accumulated oxidative stress [110]. Therefore, NAD depletion might also interfere with folate metabolism and cause cancer cell death.
