## (s33) Deep features
(p33.0) AlexNet [69] It is small network and 61M parameters to learn, but the classification accuracy is low. MobileNet [80] It's a light weight network and 4.2M parameters to learn, but it is having little high error rate. ResNet-50 [80,81,83] It is having advantage of residual block which is having skip connection from input for better learning ability. Over 25M parameters to learn. DenseNet [78,79,80] It is having connection from each layer to every other layer and hence leveraging information from other layers which learns much better compare to other networks.
