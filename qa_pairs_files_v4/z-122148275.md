## (s14) Summary and outlook
(p14.0) The THz frequency QCL has now established itself as a compact, high power, spectrally pure source particularly suited to the application of THz imaging across a range of disciplines including biomedicine, security controls, industrial inspection, non-destructive analysis and spectroscopic mapping of materials. These sources offer tremendous benefits for THz imaging in terms of high dynamic range, high spatial resolution, potentially fast imaging rates and frequency tunability that can be applied to spectroscopic analysis of targets. As such, these sources have motivated significant research interest over the past decade. Furthermore, despite the requirement for cryogenic cooling, the deployment of QCL sources within compact and turn-key systems has now become a realistic prospect [41][42][43]49]. Within recent years, a number of coherent imaging approaches using THz QCLs have also emerged, most notably through use of the self-mixing effect in these lasers, which show remarkable stability under optical reinjection [110]. The benefits of coherent detection, coupled with the further development of QCLs capable of extended tuning, broader spectral coverage, higher output powers and higher operating temperatures now offer great potential for the future advancement of THz imaging technologies.
