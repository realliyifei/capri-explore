## (s2) IV. FOCK QUANTIZATION IN NON-STATIONARY COSMOLOGICAL SETTINGS
(p2.0) As we have already mentioned, the Stone-von Neumann uniqueness result fails for infinite number of DoF, and no general result on the uniqueness of the quantization is available for non-stationary situations. This includes, of course, cases of interest in QC. In some of those cases, the underlying theory can be recast in the form of a linear scalar field with a timedependent mass, propagating in an auxiliary background spacetime which is both static and spatially compact. One such situation is the linearly polarized Gowdy model with the spatial topology of a three-torus, where the gravitational degrees of freedom are encoded by a scalar field on S 1 , evolving in time precisely as a linear field with a time-dependent mass of the type m(t) = 1/(4t 2 ) [31,32]. Other situations of interest include free scalar fields in cosmological scenarios, e.g. propagating in (compact) FLRW or the Sitter spacetimes. In those cases, the non-stationarity is transfered from the background to the field efective mass, by means of a simple transformation.
