## (s20) Source of Energy
(p20.0) Energy intake is responsible for the continuation of development and the function of all living cells, and gametes are no exception. Two metabolic pathways are producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), that supplies energy for the main functions of sperm, which are oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis [123]. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of sperm cells and provides energy for sperm metabolism [123]. Sugar, such as fructose and glucose, is considered the primary energy source in sperm cells [124]. However, fructose is the best sugar for maintaining functional membrane integrity, adequate sperm motility, andtonic after thawing [125].
