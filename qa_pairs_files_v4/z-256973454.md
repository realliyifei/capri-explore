## (s7) Crosstalk of SA and JA in poplar disease resistance
(p7.0) It is generally assumed that SA and JA are antagonistic in disease resistance in Arabidopsis, rice and tomato. Plants have to balance the costs and potential benefits of investing in defense to external stimulus (Pieterse et al., 2012;Thaler et al., 2012), but this antagonism is not obvious in poplar against rust disease. A study reported that both SA and JA contents were increased upon rust infection in black poplars, and transgenic poplar lines with high SA levels increased JA and flavonoid contents, and enhanced rust resistance (Ullah et al., 2019a;Ullah et al., 2022). Therefore, SA and JA pathways interact positively in poplars to decrease biotrophic pathogen growth (Figure 2). This difference may attribute to perennial woody plants can store large reserves of resources for defense, might have evolved SA-and JA-mediated co-defense systems without antagonism, while annual plants lack the defensive resources.
