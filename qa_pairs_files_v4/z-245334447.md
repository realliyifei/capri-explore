## (s36) FUTURE PREDICTION
(p36.0) Full blown heterogeneous architectures will become the norm [58,81]. We already see this transition in devices such as iPhones. The use of neural accelerators is prevalent in modern mobile SoCs. More recently, we see a push for neural accelerators in datacentres as well. It is only a matter of time before we start seeing these appear in consumer desktop platforms as well.
