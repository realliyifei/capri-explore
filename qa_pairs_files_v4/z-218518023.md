## (s27) Client-centric Proposal to Improve Online Behavioral Advertising.
(p27.0) Reference [46] describes the online advertising industry's proposal to mitigate the loss of privacy in OBA. The proposal is for the use of OBA disclosures: icons, accompanying taglines, and landing pages intended to inform users about OBA and provide opt-out options. The authors of Reference [46] conducted a 1,505-participant online study to investigate Internet users' perceptions of OBA disclosures. They found that the disclosures failed to clearly notify participants about OBA and inform them about their choices. The authors discuss the challenges in crafting disclosures and provide suggestions for improvement.
