## (s6) fMRI-Neurofeedback
(p6.0) Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (fMRI-NF), despite its lower temporal resolution relative to EEG-NF (seconds compared to milliseconds), has superior spatial resolution (millimetre rather than centimetre) and has the advantage that it can target the key cortical and subcortical brain function deficits that have been established in ADHD over the past 25 years of fMRI research [51] (Rubia, 2018). fMRI-NF enables participants to self-regulate the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response of a targeted brain region or network through real-time feedback of their brain activity and has shown some promise in improving clinical symptoms and cognition in psychiatric disorders [109] (Thibault, MacPherson et al., 2018). To date, however, there are only two published fMRI-NF studies in ADHD.

(p6.1) The first fMRI-NF study was a small underpowered randomised controlled trial in seven adults with ADHD who underwent four weekly 1-h fMRI-NF of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), combined with a mental calculation task, while six ADHD patients completed the same task in the scanner but were presented with visual cues indicating level of task difficulty instead of fMRI-NF [110] (Zilverstand et al., 2017). Both groups significantly increased dACC activation over the NF runs, including the transfer runs, and improved in an interference inhibition task. Both groups showed trend-level improvements in ADHD symptoms but did not differ from each other. However, only the neurofeedback group showed significantly stronger performance improvement in sustained attention and working memory tasks after treatment, but not the ADHD group that received no fMRI-NF, indicative of some positive effects of fMRI-NF of dACC on cognition in adults with ADHD [110] (Zilverstand et al., 2017).
