## (s5) Storms
(p5.0) Storms and extreme weather events have been predicted to increase in intensity and frequency [24]. The impact of storms is proportional to their strength, frequency, size and duration. Hurricanes and cyclones can impact mangroves by uprooting trees, breaking branches and defoliating their canopy [22]. Extreme storms can lead to complete large-scale mangrove mortality and increase stress due to peat collapse and rapid decreases in soil elevation [30]. Mangrove sediment elevation could be altered by storms through soil erosion, soil deposition, peat collapse, and soil compression [30], [20]. Mass mangrove mortality with little survival of saplings and tress could lead to permanent ecosystem conversion as recovery that might be hindered due to sediment elevation and hydrology changes [30].
