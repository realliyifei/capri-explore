## (s14) Fascia iliaca block:
(p14.0) In an effort to improve the obturator block seen with the 3-in-1 technique, Dalens et al. [60] introduced the FIB, a method whereby LA is injected immediately dorsal to the fascia iliaca while firm compression is applied distal to the puncture site. In 120 children randomized to a 3-in-1 block or a FIB, Dalens et al. [60] reported similar rates of complete sensory block for the femoral nerve (100%); unfortunately, the clinical test for motor blockade of the obturator nerve (elicitation of adduction at the end of surgery) did not allow for definitive conclusions. Subsequently, the same comparison was carried out in 100 adults by Capdevila et al. [61]. Again, the rates of femoral block were comparable (88-90%). However, motor blockade of the obturator nerve showed no difference (20-32%). Thus, obturator block remains elusive even with FIB.
