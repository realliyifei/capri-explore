## (s1) AGENTS PROMOTING ALVEOLAR BONE REGENERATION -BISPHOSPHONATES
(p1.0) Being similar in structure to pyrophosphate, the bisphosphonates have an affinity to the bone tissue. [6]To date, the bisphosphonates are classified into three generations [Figure 1] depending on side chains. [7]They act by inhibiting bone resorption by selectively adsorbing to the mineral surfaces and causing internalization of osteoclasts at the molecular level, which impacts the osteoclasts at the cellular level, thus inhibiting their osteoclastic activity. [8]hey also act on osteoblasts and osteocytes by preventing their apoptosis by binding and inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase. [9]ineni et al. conducted a study that compared the effect of 400 µg alendronate with β-Tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) against β-TCP alone. [10]The study included 60 subjects who were randomly divided into two groups and the clinical parameters were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months with bone levels being assessed at baseline and 6 months.The authors concluded that the combination proved better clinical outcomes and bone formation when compared to β-TCP alone.
