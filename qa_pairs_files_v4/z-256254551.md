## (s3) Homoplasmy and Heteroplasmy
(p3.0) mtDNA has a very high sequence-evolution rate, in part because it is exposed to ROS. mtDNA mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions. mtDNA mutations can be either homoplasmic or heteroplasmic when just one or more than two variants exist, respectively. 35,36 The heteroplasmic level of a certain mtDNA mutation is critical in clinical phenotypes. 36 Heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations are frequently associated with human pathologies because they cause more severe mitochondrial dysfunction than homoplasmic mtDNA mutations. Under normal conditions, mtDNA can "repair" mitochondrial dysfunction. When it comes to a certain heteroplasmic level, nevertheless, such compensation will be insufficient and lead to clinical expression of disease ( Figure 4). 37,38
