## (s22) Doubly Robust.
(p22.0) Doubly Robust (DR) [22,26,56,143] is another powerful and effective causal method account for the MNAR issue. To understand DR, let us consider the two common-used approaches to mitigate against MNAR: direct method (DM) [7] and IPS [114]. The former designs a model (linear regression, deep neural network, etc.) to directly learn the missing outcomes based on the observed data, which has low variance due to the advantage of supervised learning but suffers from high bias caused by unmet IID assumptions, denoted as [114]: where^( , ) is the estimated outcomes. The latter, though unbiased theoretically, often causes training losses to oscillate stemming from the inverse of propensity with high variance [134]. What DR does is to combine the direct method and IPS, which takes advantage of both and overcomes their limitations:

(p22.1) DR uses the estimated outcomes to decrease the variance of IPS. It is also doubly robust in that it is consistent with the policy reward value if either the propensity scores or the imputed outcomes are accurate for all user-item pairs [114,143].

(p22.2) By the way, advanced versions like Switch-DR [145] and DRos (Doubly Robust with Optimistic Shrinkage) [131] are proposed to further control the variance.

(p38.0) Counterfactual inference with separate structures Fig. 15. Separate-learning-counterfactual-inference, a common pattern of SCM-based causal inference for recommender systems, learns causal effect with a separate structure or multi-task framework and performs counterfactual inference during testing. Though a popular tool, instrumental variable seems to find little application in recommender systems because of the difficulty of finding variables that satisfy the conditions of instrumental variables. As already cited above, Sharma et al. [124] utilize an instantaneous shock in direct traffic as an instrumental variable to evaluate the recommendation effect. Si et al. [126] propose a model-agnostic framework named IV4Rec that effectively decomposes the embedding vectors into two parts: the causal part indicating a user's personal preference for an item, and the non-causal part merely reflects the statistical dependencies between users and items such as exposure mechanism and display position,  [162] Intervention on the treatment MF, LightGCN, etc. Data insufficiency 2021 CauSeR [42].

More specifically, it modifies the traditional IV method, using the residual of the least square regression as the causal embedding instead of discarding it. The causal graph is illustrated in Fig. 17.
