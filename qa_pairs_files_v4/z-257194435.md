## (s10) Hypolipidaemic and antioxidant activity
(p10.0) Flavonoids can inhibit different stages in which atherosclerosis, damage to endothelia, activation of leucocytes, adhesion platelets and aggregation and secretion occur. [10,34]The plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic index have decreased by 1 to 2% by supplementing tea catechins with a rat diet.Tannic acid and Morin can cause beneficial plasma lipid changes in the heart disease-related type.[37] A study evaluated the hypolipidemic activity of the Garcinia cambogia fruit, which in Indian medicine has a high therapeutical value and is even now used in medicines for different diseases. [22]A study investigated the antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant activities of the ethanolic extract of Garcinia cambogia on high fat diet-fed rats.Male Wistar rats were fed with either standard rodent diet or 30% high-fat diet and administered with GE at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight/day for 10 weeks.At the end, lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters were estimated.Results of the study showed that administration of GE decreased food intake, plasma TC, TAG, non HDL-C, MDA, increased HDL-C and blood antioxidants GSH, GPx, catalase.GE also reduced TOS, OSI and elevated TAS in plasma and liver of fat-fed rats.Renal OSI was significantly reduced upon GE treatment.Garcinia was effective in ameliorating high-fat-diet-induced hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress. [38]An in vitro antioxidant activity in fruit rin, hydroxyl radical scavenging, thiocyanate ferrous, total peroxide radical trapping and lipid peroxidation testing were reported in aqueous extract.In vitro protective effects against lipid and protein oxidation have been shown in garcinol and guttiferone K isolated from the fruit.The growth of plasma, platelet and thiobarbituric acid-reactive species induced by peroxynitrite in both cases has reduced significantly the growth of carbonyl groups.These compounds, however, did not inhibit the plasma and platelet nitrate induced by peroxynitrite [N.H.
