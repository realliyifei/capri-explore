## (s4) Impacts on Appetite
(p4.0) Appetite is a mental feeling of hunger, satiation, satiety and a desire to eat specific type of food and is one of the factors affecting calorie intake [58,59]. Hall et al. (2012) investigated the effects of consuming A. nodosum enriched bread (4% A. nodosum per 400 g loaf) as part of a meal on energy intake in otherwise healthy 12 males. As compared to control bread (0% A. nodosum), consumption of this enriched bread at breakfast led to 16.4% significant reduction in energy intake at a test meal 4 h later and reported to significantly lower 24-h total energy intake by 506.1 kcal. No significant differences were seen in glycaemic or cholesterolaemic factors following the administration of the A. nodosum enriched bread compared to the control bread, which suggested that neither delayed gastric emptying nor nutrient encapsulation occurred. Moreover, no significant differences in hunger or fullness were reported by these authors [50].
