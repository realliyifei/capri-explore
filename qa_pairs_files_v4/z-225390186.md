## (s8) RGB Imaging
(p8.0) The use of RGB imaging to acquire image data for plant species discrimination is well established. The RGB system of color cameras equipped with broadband filters is typical representatives of high spatial resolution systems with limited spectral resolution. Spatial resolution refers to the area where individual measurements can be made. Imaging systems with high spatial resolution can have pixel resolutions of the order of a few millimeters or even smaller [65]. Although only broadband reflectance images are acquired, it is sufficient to effectively distinguish plants from the background such as soil based on different spectral characteristics [66]. After segmenting the acquired image with broadband reflectance data, the features representing morphology or texture of plant canopy and plant leaf can be extracted for different plant differentiations.
