## (s26) CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
(p26.0) Cardiovascular disease associated with shift work is one of the problems that have been studied for more than two decades since it has long been assumed that shift work has a detrimental effect on the vascular system. This assumption was strengthened by several studies conducted in this same area (Karlsson, Knutsson, & Lindahl, 2001;Puttonen et al., 2009;Van Amelsvoort et al., 2004). However, more recent studies have been questioning the absolute causal relationship, since they consider that the evidence is limited, and there are still some studies that conclude that there is no relation between shift work and cardiovascular diseases (Frost et al., 2009;Hublin et al., 2010).

(p26.1) Studies have shown that the relative risk of developing cardiovascular disease in men who work in shifts is 1.5 times higher than that in men working at regular schedules (Akerstedt & Knutsson, 1997). However, risk factors of 0.64-2.25 were reported in other studies and a higher relative risk was still reported in a woman who works in shifts (BÃ¸ggild & Knutsson, 1999;Frost et al., 2009;Ha & Park, 2005;Puttonen et al., 2009).
