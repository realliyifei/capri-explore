## (s7) Anti-Atherosclerotic Effects
(p7.0) Anti-atherosclerotic and anti-thrombotic effects of V. negundo and its compounds have been studied previously. Betulinic acid has been shown to modulate vascular inflammation and protect against atherosclerosis by promoting cholesterol efflux, suppressing IκB phosphorylation, downregulating NF-κB activation, reducing atherosclerotic lesion size, suppressing nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p65 and increasing expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) via miR-33 s down-regulation. 48 ABCA1 is important in promoting cholesterol efflux from macrophages hence exerting antiatherosclerotic role. 48 Betulinic acid also exhibits anti-thrombotic effects by exerting antiplatelet activities. 50 However, further investigations need to be done to validate this effect.
