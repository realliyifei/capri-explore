## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) The ongoing wave of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread very rapidly and has affected millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with a length of about 30 kb encompassing non-structural and structural proteins. Spike glycoprotein, a structural protein present on the virus surface plays an important role in binding with ACE2. This RNA virus can make a replica of its own after binding with the host cell, thereby causing several mutations [24]. Whenever the mutation is significant, the structure of the virus changes, resulting in a new variant or lineage 2 of the virus [38]. Motivated by this observation, in this study we have performed a competitive analysis of several variants of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is happening over time, thereby resulting in new variants. Whenever a new variant emerges, it can be called as an "emerging variant" which have some potential consequences viz. increase in transmissibility, morbidity as well as mortality. It is to be noted that the different variants have some unique as well as some common mutations. In this regard, there are 12 important variants as declared by W.H.O 3 and 84 unique mutations that are reported in this work. Some of these variants have been categorised as either variants of concern, variants of interest or variants under monitoring based on their transmissibility, immunity and infection severity 4 . As of now, the variants of concern are Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)3. The two common features which mark any variant of concern are multiple mutations in Spike glycoprotein as compared to B.1 which is also known as the "wild-type" (with D614G and no other Spike glycoprotein changes) as well as at least one mutation in receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein4. Apart from the variants of concern, the variant of interest is Lambda (C. 37 Spike glycoprotein with a length of 1273 aa covers the SARS-CoV-2 surface. This protein consists of two functional subunits: S1 which is responsible for receptor binding and S2 which is responsible for membrane fusion [42]. The N-terminal domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) are the major two domains of S1 subunit while fusion peptide (FP), heptapeptide repeat sequence 1 (HR1), heptapeptide repeat sequence 2 (HR2), transmembrane (TM) domain and cytoplasm domain are covered by S2 subunit. In the S1 subunit, RDB is responsible for binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor [15]. After binding with cell receptor, TM protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) on the receptor cell activates the Spike glycoprotein. Whenever the S1 subunit binds to the ACE2 host cell receptors, then the S2 subunits perform two major conformational changes to complete the virus fusion to the cell membrane.

(p0.1) Considering the aforementioned analysis, in this work we have performed multiple sequence alignment of 77681 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 98 countries over the period from January 2020 to July 2021 using MAFFT [19] followed by phylogenetic analysis to analyse the mutations in Spike glycoprotein. 12 different important variants identified so far are Alpha, Beta, Eta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Gamma, Zeta, Theta and Omicron. These variants have 84 unique mutations and include some notable mutations like K417N, L452R, S477N, T478K, E484K/Q, N501Y, D614G, P681H/R, Y144-, H69-and V70-. Furthermore, the characteristics of the variants are elaborately discussed along with their specific mutations. Thereafter, the individual evolution of these mutation points are visualised along with their evolution in the respective variants. Moreover, the characteristics of the nonsynonymous mutation points (substitutions) are judged by evaluating their biological functions by considering the sequences and using PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 evaluates the protein structural stability. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive review of the emerging variants and the characteristics of the corresponding mutation points along with the effects of vaccine and therapeutics on the variants.

## (s7) Effects of vaccine and therapeutics on different variants
(p7.0) Vaccines are the most advanced weapon that the human race has devised to fight against this deadly virus. There are several vaccines like Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson which have been developed till now by the scientists around the world. However, some emerging variants like Omicron [26] may be somewhat resistant to the antibody response evoked by these vaccines, thereby making the modifications to these vaccines an absolute necessity. Trials have indicated that many of these vaccines have shown lower efficacy against some of the variants but are effective against the common circulating strains. Table 6 reports the efficacy of the most widely used vaccines for symptomatic as well as severely affected patients. Results have shown that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna produced vaccines have an efficacy of 82-100% and 96.3% against the original strain for symptomatic patients while against Delta the efficacy reduces to 42-79% for Pfizer-BioNTech and around 80% for Moderna. For severe patients, efficacy against Delta variant are around 85% and 90% respectively. Gamma variant has been found to partially escape vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shows an efficacy of 79% against Alpha as opposed to less than 60% against other variants for symptomatic patients. The efficacy of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Beta was put into question in February 2021 when it was reported that the vaccine is not very effective against this strain. As can be seen from Table 6, the efficacy is indeed very low at 10%. In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson reported that their vaccine was 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection in US while such efficiency is 57% in South Africa. According to latest data, Johnson & Johnson vaccine has shown 72% and 86% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 respectively for the original strain while for other variants the results vary from 40% to around 75% for both symptomatic and severe patients. Covaxin has also shown promising results for Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants for symptomatic patients. It is to be noted that Covaxin, Covishield (Indian made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Sputnik V have shown effectiveness in neutralising Alpha variant [37]. In March 2021, Novavax vaccine was reported to have a preliminary efficiency of 51% for mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 for HIV-negative patients. According to [11,7], K417N/T, E484K and N501Y are also resistant to neutralisation by vaccines. Despite this, [7] has also reported that sera from infected and Moderna-vaccinated individuals having polyclonal antibodies to the Spike glycoprotein can neutralise the Beta variant. This suggests that protective humoral immunity may be retained against Beta. Research regarding effectiveness of the existing vaccines against the latest circulating Omicron variant is ongoing.
## (s8) Conclusion
(p8.0) In this work, we have provided a comprehensive study of the different important variants of SARS-CoV-2 and their corresponding unique mutation points in Spike glycoprotein. This is especially important to understand the effect of the mutations on the vaccines. In this regard, there are 12 important variants of SARS-CoV-2 which are identified; they being Alpha, Beta, Eta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Gamma, Zeta, Theta and lately, Omicron and they have 84 unique mutations in the Spike glycoprotein. These 84 include such mutations like S371L, N440K, G446S, Q493R, N501Y etc. which are   Near furin cleavage site, may affect transmissibility of the virus [2] known to resist antibodies.

## (s29) Introduction
(p29.0) The ongoing wave of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread very rapidly and has affected millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with a length of about 30 kb encompassing non-structural and structural proteins. Spike glycoprotein, a structural protein present on the virus surface plays an important role in binding with ACE2. This RNA virus can make a replica of its own after binding with the host cell, thereby causing several mutations [24]. Whenever the mutation is significant, the structure of the virus changes, resulting in a new variant or lineage 2 of the virus [38]. Motivated by this observation, in this study we have performed a competitive analysis of several variants of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is happening over time, thereby resulting in new variants. Whenever a new variant emerges, it can be called as an "emerging variant" which have some potential consequences viz. increase in transmissibility, morbidity as well as mortality. It is to be noted that the different variants have some unique as well as some common mutations. In this regard, there are 12 important variants as declared by W.H.O 3 and 84 unique mutations that are reported in this work. Some of these variants have been categorised as either variants of concern, variants of interest or variants under monitoring based on their transmissibility, immunity and infection severity 4 . As of now, the variants of concern are Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)3. The two common features which mark any variant of concern are multiple mutations in Spike glycoprotein as compared to B.1 which is also known as the "wild-type" (with D614G and no other Spike glycoprotein changes) as well as at least one mutation in receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein4. Apart from the variants of concern, the variant of interest is Lambda (C. 37 Spike glycoprotein with a length of 1273 aa covers the SARS-CoV-2 surface. This protein consists of two functional subunits: S1 which is responsible for receptor binding and S2 which is responsible for membrane fusion [42]. The N-terminal domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) are the major two domains of S1 subunit while fusion peptide (FP), heptapeptide repeat sequence 1 (HR1), heptapeptide repeat sequence 2 (HR2), transmembrane (TM) domain and cytoplasm domain are covered by S2 subunit. In the S1 subunit, RDB is responsible for binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor [15]. After binding with cell receptor, TM protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) on the receptor cell activates the Spike glycoprotein. Whenever the S1 subunit binds to the ACE2 host cell receptors, then the S2 subunits perform two major conformational changes to complete the virus fusion to the cell membrane.

(p29.1) Considering the aforementioned analysis, in this work we have performed multiple sequence alignment of 77681 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 98 countries over the period from January 2020 to July 2021 using MAFFT [19] followed by phylogenetic analysis to analyse the mutations in Spike glycoprotein. 12 different important variants identified so far are Alpha, Beta, Eta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Gamma, Zeta, Theta and Omicron. These variants have 84 unique mutations and include some notable mutations like K417N, L452R, S477N, T478K, E484K/Q, N501Y, D614G, P681H/R, Y144-, H69-and V70-. Furthermore, the characteristics of the variants are elaborately discussed along with their specific mutations. Thereafter, the individual evolution of these mutation points are visualised along with their evolution in the respective variants. Moreover, the characteristics of the nonsynonymous mutation points (substitutions) are judged by evaluating their biological functions by considering the sequences and using PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 evaluates the protein structural stability. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive review of the emerging variants and the characteristics of the corresponding mutation points along with the effects of vaccine and therapeutics on the variants.

## (s36) Effects of vaccine and therapeutics on different variants
(p36.0) Vaccines are the most advanced weapon that the human race has devised to fight against this deadly virus. There are several vaccines like Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson which have been developed till now by the scientists around the world. However, some emerging variants like Omicron [26] may be somewhat resistant to the antibody response evoked by these vaccines, thereby making the modifications to these vaccines an absolute necessity. Trials have indicated that many of these vaccines have shown lower efficacy against some of the variants but are effective against the common circulating strains. Table 6 reports the efficacy of the most widely used vaccines for symptomatic as well as severely affected patients. Results have shown that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna produced vaccines have an efficacy of 82-100% and 96.3% against the original strain for symptomatic patients while against Delta the efficacy reduces to 42-79% for Pfizer-BioNTech and around 80% for Moderna. For severe patients, efficacy against Delta variant are around 85% and 90% respectively. Gamma variant has been found to partially escape vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shows an efficacy of 79% against Alpha as opposed to less than 60% against other variants for symptomatic patients. The efficacy of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Beta was put into question in February 2021 when it was reported that the vaccine is not very effective against this strain. As can be seen from Table 6, the efficacy is indeed very low at 10%. In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson reported that their vaccine was 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection in US while such efficiency is 57% in South Africa. According to latest data, Johnson & Johnson vaccine has shown 72% and 86% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 respectively for the original strain while for other variants the results vary from 40% to around 75% for both symptomatic and severe patients. Covaxin has also shown promising results for Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants for symptomatic patients. It is to be noted that Covaxin, Covishield (Indian made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Sputnik V have shown effectiveness in neutralising Alpha variant [37]. In March 2021, Novavax vaccine was reported to have a preliminary efficiency of 51% for mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 for HIV-negative patients. According to [11,7], K417N/T, E484K and N501Y are also resistant to neutralisation by vaccines. Despite this, [7] has also reported that sera from infected and Moderna-vaccinated individuals having polyclonal antibodies to the Spike glycoprotein can neutralise the Beta variant. This suggests that protective humoral immunity may be retained against Beta. Research regarding effectiveness of the existing vaccines against the latest circulating Omicron variant is ongoing.

## (s58) Introduction
(p58.0) The ongoing wave of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread very rapidly and has affected millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with a length of about 30 kb encompassing non-structural and structural proteins. Spike glycoprotein, a structural protein present on the virus surface plays an important role in binding with ACE2. This RNA virus can make a replica of its own after binding with the host cell, thereby causing several mutations [24]. Whenever the mutation is significant, the structure of the virus changes, resulting in a new variant or lineage 2 of the virus [38]. Motivated by this observation, in this study we have performed a competitive analysis of several variants of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is happening over time, thereby resulting in new variants. Whenever a new variant emerges, it can be called as an "emerging variant" which have some potential consequences viz. increase in transmissibility, morbidity as well as mortality. It is to be noted that the different variants have some unique as well as some common mutations. In this regard, there are 12 important variants as declared by W.H.O 3 and 84 unique mutations that are reported in this work. Some of these variants have been categorised as either variants of concern, variants of interest or variants under monitoring based on their transmissibility, immunity and infection severity 4 . As of now, the variants of concern are Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)3. The two common features which mark any variant of concern are multiple mutations in Spike glycoprotein as compared to B.1 which is also known as the "wild-type" (with D614G and no other Spike glycoprotein changes) as well as at least one mutation in receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein4. Apart from the variants of concern, the variant of interest is Lambda (C. 37 Spike glycoprotein with a length of 1273 aa covers the SARS-CoV-2 surface. This protein consists of two functional subunits: S1 which is responsible for receptor binding and S2 which is responsible for membrane fusion [42]. The N-terminal domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) are the major two domains of S1 subunit while fusion peptide (FP), heptapeptide repeat sequence 1 (HR1), heptapeptide repeat sequence 2 (HR2), transmembrane (TM) domain and cytoplasm domain are covered by S2 subunit. In the S1 subunit, RDB is responsible for binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor [15]. After binding with cell receptor, TM protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) on the receptor cell activates the Spike glycoprotein. Whenever the S1 subunit binds to the ACE2 host cell receptors, then the S2 subunits perform two major conformational changes to complete the virus fusion to the cell membrane.

(p58.1) Considering the aforementioned analysis, in this work we have performed multiple sequence alignment of 77681 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 98 countries over the period from January 2020 to July 2021 using MAFFT [19] followed by phylogenetic analysis to analyse the mutations in Spike glycoprotein. 12 different important variants identified so far are Alpha, Beta, Eta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Gamma, Zeta, Theta and Omicron. These variants have 84 unique mutations and include some notable mutations like K417N, L452R, S477N, T478K, E484K/Q, N501Y, D614G, P681H/R, Y144-, H69-and V70-. Furthermore, the characteristics of the variants are elaborately discussed along with their specific mutations. Thereafter, the individual evolution of these mutation points are visualised along with their evolution in the respective variants. Moreover, the characteristics of the nonsynonymous mutation points (substitutions) are judged by evaluating their biological functions by considering the sequences and using PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 evaluates the protein structural stability. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive review of the emerging variants and the characteristics of the corresponding mutation points along with the effects of vaccine and therapeutics on the variants.

It is to be noted that the different variants have some unique as well as some common mutations.

Some of these variants have been categorised as either variants of concern, variants of interest or variants under monitoring based on their transmissibility, immunity and infection severity 4 . As of now, the variants of concern are Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)3. The two common features which mark any variant of concern are multiple mutations in Spike glycoprotein as compared to B.1 which is also known as the "wild-type" (with D614G and no other Spike glycoprotein changes) as well as at least one mutation in receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein4. Apart from the variants of concern, the variant of interest is Lambda (C. 37 Spike glycoprotein with a length of 1273 aa covers the SARS-CoV-2 surface. This protein consists of two functional subunits: S1 which is responsible for receptor binding and S2 which is responsible for membrane fusion [42].

## (s65) Effects of vaccine and therapeutics on different variants
(p65.0) Vaccines are the most advanced weapon that the human race has devised to fight against this deadly virus. There are several vaccines like Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson which have been developed till now by the scientists around the world. However, some emerging variants like Omicron [26] may be somewhat resistant to the antibody response evoked by these vaccines, thereby making the modifications to these vaccines an absolute necessity. Trials have indicated that many of these vaccines have shown lower efficacy against some of the variants but are effective against the common circulating strains. Table 6 reports the efficacy of the most widely used vaccines for symptomatic as well as severely affected patients. Results have shown that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna produced vaccines have an efficacy of 82-100% and 96.3% against the original strain for symptomatic patients while against Delta the efficacy reduces to 42-79% for Pfizer-BioNTech and around 80% for Moderna. For severe patients, efficacy against Delta variant are around 85% and 90% respectively. Gamma variant has been found to partially escape vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shows an efficacy of 79% against Alpha as opposed to less than 60% against other variants for symptomatic patients. The efficacy of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Beta was put into question in February 2021 when it was reported that the vaccine is not very effective against this strain. As can be seen from Table 6, the efficacy is indeed very low at 10%. In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson reported that their vaccine was 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection in US while such efficiency is 57% in South Africa. According to latest data, Johnson & Johnson vaccine has shown 72% and 86% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 respectively for the original strain while for other variants the results vary from 40% to around 75% for both symptomatic and severe patients. Covaxin has also shown promising results for Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants for symptomatic patients. It is to be noted that Covaxin, Covishield (Indian made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Sputnik V have shown effectiveness in neutralising Alpha variant [37]. In March 2021, Novavax vaccine was reported to have a preliminary efficiency of 51% for mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 for HIV-negative patients. According to [11,7], K417N/T, E484K and N501Y are also resistant to neutralisation by vaccines. Despite this, [7] has also reported that sera from infected and Moderna-vaccinated individuals having polyclonal antibodies to the Spike glycoprotein can neutralise the Beta variant. This suggests that protective humoral immunity may be retained against Beta. Research regarding effectiveness of the existing vaccines against the latest circulating Omicron variant is ongoing.

Whenever the mutation is significant, the structure of the virus changes, resulting in a new variant or lineage 2 of the virus [38]. Motivated by this observation, in this study we have performed a competitive analysis of several variants of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is happening over time, thereby resulting in new variants. Whenever a new variant emerges, it can be called as an "emerging variant" which have some potential consequences viz. increase in transmissibility, morbidity as well as mortality. It is to be noted that the different variants have some unique as well as some common mutations. In this regard, there are 12 important variants as declared by W.H.O 3 and 84 unique mutations that are reported in this work. Some of these variants have been categorised as either variants of concern, variants of interest or variants under monitoring based on their transmissibility, immunity and infection severity 4 . As of now, the variants of concern are Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)3. The two common features which mark any variant of concern are multiple mutations in Spike glycoprotein as compared to B.1 which is also known as the "wild-type" (with D614G and no other Spike glycoprotein changes) as well as at least one mutation in receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein4.

(p87.4) The ongoing wave of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread very rapidly and has affected millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with a length of about 30 kb encompassing non-structural and structural proteins. Spike glycoprotein, a structural protein present on the virus surface plays an important role in binding with ACE2. This RNA virus can make a replica of its own after binding with the host cell, thereby causing several mutations [24]. Whenever the mutation is significant, the structure of the virus changes, resulting in a new variant or lineage 2 of the virus [38]. Motivated by this observation, in this study we have performed a competitive analysis of several variants of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is happening over time, thereby resulting in new variants. Whenever a new variant emerges, it can be called as an "emerging variant" which have some potential consequences viz. increase in transmissibility, morbidity as well as mortality. It is to be noted that the different variants have some unique as well as some common mutations. In this regard, there are 12 important variants as declared by W.H.O 3 and 84 unique mutations that are reported in this work. Some of these variants have been categorised as either variants of concern, variants of interest or variants under monitoring based on their transmissibility, immunity and infection severity 4 . As of now, the variants of concern are Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)3. The two common features which mark any variant of concern are multiple mutations in Spike glycoprotein as compared to B.1 which is also known as the "wild-type" (with D614G and no other Spike glycoprotein changes) as well as at least one mutation in receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein4. Apart from the variants of concern, the variant of interest is Lambda (C. 37 Spike glycoprotein with a length of 1273 aa covers the SARS-CoV-2 surface. This protein consists of two functional subunits: S1 which is responsible for receptor binding and S2 which is responsible for membrane fusion [42]. The N-terminal domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) are the major two domains of S1 subunit while fusion peptide (FP), heptapeptide repeat sequence 1 (HR1), heptapeptide repeat sequence 2 (HR2), transmembrane (TM) domain and cytoplasm domain are covered by S2 subunit. In the S1 subunit, RDB is responsible for binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor [15]. After binding with cell receptor, TM protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) on the receptor cell activates the Spike glycoprotein. Whenever the S1 subunit binds to the ACE2 host cell receptors, then the S2 subunits perform two major conformational changes to complete the virus fusion to the cell membrane.

These variants have 84 unique mutations and include some notable mutations like K417N, L452R, S477N, T478K, E484K/Q, N501Y, D614G, P681H/R, Y144-, H69-and V70-.

## (s94) Effects of vaccine and therapeutics on different variants
(p94.0) Vaccines are the most advanced weapon that the human race has devised to fight against this deadly virus. There are several vaccines like Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson which have been developed till now by the scientists around the world. However, some emerging variants like Omicron [26] may be somewhat resistant to the antibody response evoked by these vaccines, thereby making the modifications to these vaccines an absolute necessity. Trials have indicated that many of these vaccines have shown lower efficacy against some of the variants but are effective against the common circulating strains. Table 6 reports the efficacy of the most widely used vaccines for symptomatic as well as severely affected patients. Results have shown that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna produced vaccines have an efficacy of 82-100% and 96.3% against the original strain for symptomatic patients while against Delta the efficacy reduces to 42-79% for Pfizer-BioNTech and around 80% for Moderna. For severe patients, efficacy against Delta variant are around 85% and 90% respectively. Gamma variant has been found to partially escape vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shows an efficacy of 79% against Alpha as opposed to less than 60% against other variants for symptomatic patients. The efficacy of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Beta was put into question in February 2021 when it was reported that the vaccine is not very effective against this strain. As can be seen from Table 6, the efficacy is indeed very low at 10%. In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson reported that their vaccine was 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection in US while such efficiency is 57% in South Africa. According to latest data, Johnson & Johnson vaccine has shown 72% and 86% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 respectively for the original strain while for other variants the results vary from 40% to around 75% for both symptomatic and severe patients. Covaxin has also shown promising results for Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants for symptomatic patients. It is to be noted that Covaxin, Covishield (Indian made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Sputnik V have shown effectiveness in neutralising Alpha variant [37]. In March 2021, Novavax vaccine was reported to have a preliminary efficiency of 51% for mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 for HIV-negative patients. According to [11,7], K417N/T, E484K and N501Y are also resistant to neutralisation by vaccines. Despite this, [7] has also reported that sera from infected and Moderna-vaccinated individuals having polyclonal antibodies to the Spike glycoprotein can neutralise the Beta variant. This suggests that protective humoral immunity may be retained against Beta. Research regarding effectiveness of the existing vaccines against the latest circulating Omicron variant is ongoing.

Some of these variants have been categorised as either variants of concern, variants of interest or variants under monitoring based on their transmissibility, immunity and infection severity 4 . As of now, the variants of concern are Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)3. The two common features which mark any variant of concern are multiple mutations in Spike glycoprotein as compared to B.1 which is also known as the "wild-type" (with D614G and no other Spike glycoprotein changes) as well as at least one mutation in receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein4.

Furthermore, the characteristics of the variants are elaborately discussed along with their specific mutations. Thereafter, the individual evolution of these mutation points are visualised along with their evolution in the respective variants. Moreover, the characteristics of the nonsynonymous mutation points (substitutions) are judged by evaluating their biological functions by considering the sequences and using PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 evaluates the protein structural stability.

In the S1 subunit, RDB is responsible for binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor [15]. After binding with cell receptor, TM protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) on the receptor cell activates the Spike glycoprotein. Whenever the S1 subunit binds to the ACE2 host cell receptors, then the S2 subunits perform two major conformational changes to complete the virus fusion to the cell membrane.

(p116.5) Considering the aforementioned analysis, in this work we have performed multiple sequence alignment of 77681 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 98 countries over the period from January 2020 to July 2021 using MAFFT [19] followed by phylogenetic analysis to analyse the mutations in Spike glycoprotein. 12 different important variants identified so far are Alpha, Beta, Eta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Gamma, Zeta, Theta and Omicron. These variants have 84 unique mutations and include some notable mutations like K417N, L452R, S477N, T478K, E484K/Q, N501Y, D614G, P681H/R, Y144-, H69-and V70-. Furthermore, the characteristics of the variants are elaborately discussed along with their specific mutations. Thereafter, the individual evolution of these mutation points are visualised along with their evolution in the respective variants. Moreover, the characteristics of the nonsynonymous mutation points (substitutions) are judged by evaluating their biological functions by considering the sequences and using PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 evaluates the protein structural stability. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive review of the emerging variants and the characteristics of the corresponding mutation points along with the effects of vaccine and therapeutics on the variants.

(p116.6) The ongoing wave of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread very rapidly and has affected millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with a length of about 30 kb encompassing non-structural and structural proteins. Spike glycoprotein, a structural protein present on the virus surface plays an important role in binding with ACE2. This RNA virus can make a replica of its own after binding with the host cell, thereby causing several mutations [24]. Whenever the mutation is significant, the structure of the virus changes, resulting in a new variant or lineage 2 of the virus [38]. Motivated by this observation, in this study we have performed a competitive analysis of several variants of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is happening over time, thereby resulting in new variants. Whenever a new variant emerges, it can be called as an "emerging variant" which have some potential consequences viz. increase in transmissibility, morbidity as well as mortality. It is to be noted that the different variants have some unique as well as some common mutations. In this regard, there are 12 important variants as declared by W.H.O 3 and 84 unique mutations that are reported in this work. Some of these variants have been categorised as either variants of concern, variants of interest or variants under monitoring based on their transmissibility, immunity and infection severity 4 . As of now, the variants of concern are Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)3. The two common features which mark any variant of concern are multiple mutations in Spike glycoprotein as compared to B.1 which is also known as the "wild-type" (with D614G and no other Spike glycoprotein changes) as well as at least one mutation in receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein4. Apart from the variants of concern, the variant of interest is Lambda (C. 37 Spike glycoprotein with a length of 1273 aa covers the SARS-CoV-2 surface. This protein consists of two functional subunits: S1 which is responsible for receptor binding and S2 which is responsible for membrane fusion [42].

## (s123) Effects of vaccine and therapeutics on different variants
(p123.0) Vaccines are the most advanced weapon that the human race has devised to fight against this deadly virus. There are several vaccines like Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson which have been developed till now by the scientists around the world. However, some emerging variants like Omicron [26] may be somewhat resistant to the antibody response evoked by these vaccines, thereby making the modifications to these vaccines an absolute necessity. Trials have indicated that many of these vaccines have shown lower efficacy against some of the variants but are effective against the common circulating strains. Table 6 reports the efficacy of the most widely used vaccines for symptomatic as well as severely affected patients. Results have shown that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna produced vaccines have an efficacy of 82-100% and 96.3% against the original strain for symptomatic patients while against Delta the efficacy reduces to 42-79% for Pfizer-BioNTech and around 80% for Moderna. For severe patients, efficacy against Delta variant are around 85% and 90% respectively. Gamma variant has been found to partially escape vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shows an efficacy of 79% against Alpha as opposed to less than 60% against other variants for symptomatic patients. The efficacy of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Beta was put into question in February 2021 when it was reported that the vaccine is not very effective against this strain. As can be seen from Table 6, the efficacy is indeed very low at 10%. In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson reported that their vaccine was 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection in US while such efficiency is 57% in South Africa. According to latest data, Johnson & Johnson vaccine has shown 72% and 86% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 respectively for the original strain while for other variants the results vary from 40% to around 75% for both symptomatic and severe patients. Covaxin has also shown promising results for Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants for symptomatic patients. It is to be noted that Covaxin, Covishield (Indian made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Sputnik V have shown effectiveness in neutralising Alpha variant [37]. In March 2021, Novavax vaccine was reported to have a preliminary efficiency of 51% for mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 for HIV-negative patients. According to [11,7], K417N/T, E484K and N501Y are also resistant to neutralisation by vaccines. Despite this, [7] has also reported that sera from infected and Moderna-vaccinated individuals having polyclonal antibodies to the Spike glycoprotein can neutralise the Beta variant. This suggests that protective humoral immunity may be retained against Beta. Research regarding effectiveness of the existing vaccines against the latest circulating Omicron variant is ongoing.
