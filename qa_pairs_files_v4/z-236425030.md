## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Biotechnological products play an ever-increasing role for several sectors of the producing industry. In the medical sector, some of such processes are already established (e.g., insulin production), and also the pharma industry takes more and more advantage of biotechnology (e.g., CAR-T therapies). In food production, gene-modified plants promise higher yield using less pesticides. In a few years, meat grown in the laboratory may be found in grocery stores [1]. Another novel sector is that of synthetic biology, where biological products and their gene codes are fully engineered to create food, medicine or even replacements for technical parts [2].
