## (s15) B. Applications
(p15.0) Though the general goal of self-supervised learning is to perform task-independent representation learning which can benefit various downstream tasks, it has to be noted that different self-supervision can have different influences on different tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to pre-consider the choice of self-supervised methods when we are targeting a specific application in the end. In fact, so far a large number of self-supervised works in the remote sensing field are based on a specific application. In general, the various applications can be separated into three categories: image-level tasks, pixellevel tasks and patch-level tasks. A list of representative recent self-supervised works classified w.r.t applications is shown in Table II. We refer the interested reader to the numerous surveys on machine learning and deep learning in remote sensing [8,239,240,241,242,243,244] for more details about common downstream tasks and available datasets.
