## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Neural rehabilitation, to the extent this is possible, aims to restore the functionality of impaired neurological circuits or complement remaining functionality. This aims to enhance patient independence and quality of life through exploitation of neural plasticity [1,2]. Predominant focus of the neural rehabilitation field lies on restoration of sensorimotor control and functions. Neural plasticity is based on the hypothesis that central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) circuits can be retrained after a lesion in order to facilitate effective rehabilitation [3]. The main neural rehabilitation research approaches can be described as bottom-up procedures where, by acting on the affected limbs, one aims to influence the CNS; however, the exact afferent mechanisms of neuroplasticity behind this approach are still unknown [4]. Neural prosthetic grasping hands and legs, support exoskeletons, and body-weight support/robotic treadmill systems all share the bottom-up approach, where plasticity is driven by the device and by rehabilitation practice. Recently an emerging research trend is exploring top-down approaches as a new paradigm for exploiting neuroplasticity by first studying and modulating the state of the brain [4]. As such, rehabilitation is driven by said neuroplastic changes [4]. Brain-computer interfaces and virtual reality variants all fall in this category where neural plasticity is recruited to accommodate lasting rehabilitation effects. Additionally, there is a current focus on repetitive and intensive training; however, other principles of motor learning (such as transferability of learning to daily activities, active engagement, and problem solving) are not yet fully explored [5]. Due to its repetitive, intensive, and task-specific nature, robotics rehabilitation is a great candidate for integrating the abovementioned hypotheses for retraining the CNS [4,5].
## (s9) Human-Robot Control Interfaces
(p9.0) Human-robot control interfaces (invasive and noninvasive) are technologies that acquire, decode, and communicate the intention of a human user to a device via control commands ( Figure 3). Such a device can be a wearable exoskeleton or a prosthetic/bionic device [7]. The technologies mentioned in this section interface either directly (digital-neural interfaces) or indirectly (EMG interfaces) with the PNS or with the CNS (BCIs) [101,102]. Such technologies use a physical interface via electrodes that based on invasiveness can be discriminated into either implantable (applied directly at the brain/muscle/nerve) or surface (applied on the skin) devices [102]. Human-robot interfaces (HRIs) are interfacing the human (brain, muscle, and nerves) with a device by acquiring biological signals, decoding them, and translating them to control commands for various assistive, rehabilitation, or prosthetic devices.
## (s18) Technological Challenges of Neuroprosthetics
(p18.0) The purpose of controlled neuroprosthetics is to transfer control intent from the central nervous system to drive the prosthetic devices of users with immobilized body parts [168]. Such control generally requires high levels of concentration by the patient and long training periods, often resulting in high rejection rates of prosthetics [129]. To accomplish robust control, there are two main challenges: (1) development of neural interfaces that last a long period, and (2) skillful control of the prosthetic device comparable to natural movements [168]. Up-to-date hand prostheses are actuated by advanced motors, allowing the restoration of fine motor skills with direct muscular signals connection [169]. In the long run, the goal is to accomplish a quantum-leap advance in neural controllable degrees of autonomy that should permit the user to perform tasks of daily living without effort [168]. Some points to consider regarding control and feedback are the location of the interface with the CNS and the PNS, as well as the invasiveness of the interface, from noninvasive interfaces to the most invasive interfaces requiring surgical implantation [170]. Surgical procedures, such as targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) [171][172][173] and osseointegration [174], greatly improved PNS signal decoding and subsequently improved prosthetic control, as well as the donning/doffing and stability of the prosthetic fixture. In TMSR, motor and sensory nerves of a severed limb are surgically rerouted to reinnervate regions of large intact muscles (the pectoralis for the upper extremity and the hamstring for the lower extremity [171][172][173]). Osseointegration is a surgical procedure where a load-bearing implant is directly integrated with the residual bone of the amputee to improve prosthetic connection and sensory feedback [174].

(p18.1) Regarding control, the key technologies used for interfacing prosthetics with an amputee are EMG, neural and BCI interfaces (interfacing directly or indirectly with the PNS), and body-powered and impedance/admittance control (interfacing with the residual/unimpaired anatomy of the user) [7,102,168]. The three key ways to interface with the PNS/CNS are described in Section 3.1. and are very popular with UL prosthetic control [7]. Impedance control manages the relation between position and force and is mainly applicable in LL prosthetics controlled by the multi-joint mechanical impedance. To control a prosthetic, it is equally important that the user can have a proper feedforward and feedback signal. This can be achieved via body-powered control methods that focus on the use of the remaining anatomy of the human to mechanically control a prosthetic limb [7]. Body-powered control can be complemented/combined with other approaches such as cineplasty, muscle bulging, myoelectricity, and myo-acoustics to create hybrid control interfaces for UL prosthetics. Additionally, FES based neuroprostheses (in the case of FES, the impaired existing limb is considered the prosthesis) can stimulate muscles or nerves [175,176] to elicit movement in the impaired limb and enable UL function restoration [177] and LL gait training [178]. FES can act as a standalone [177,178] or in combination with robotic exoskeletons [179].
