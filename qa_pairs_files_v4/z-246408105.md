## (s11) Dynamic tube blocking test
(p11.0) Dynamic tube blocking test is one of the main testing methodologies to evaluate the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) required to prevent the formation of scale under dynamic flow condition. In principle, it involves measurements of the increasing pressure caused by scale deposition on the test tube wall. Scale inhibition efficiency is represented by the ratio of the time needs to obstruct the tube flow in the presence and the absence of the inhibitors (Macedo et al. 2019;Sanni et al. 2019).
## (s12) Pilot plant test
(p12.0) The pilot plant tests are conducted in a recirculating cooling water system or in a simulating device to test the field application performance of a scale inhibitor (Neveux et al. 2016;Chen et al. 2019). Comparing to other methods, pilot plant test can not only offer a flexible operation as the system can be directly controlled by computer, but also directly obtain the feasibility of the tested agent. However, such experiment condition of pilot plant tests is difficult to achieve in general laboratories.
