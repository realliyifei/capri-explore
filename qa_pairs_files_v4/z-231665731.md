## (s17) Ethics and Security
(p17.0) Security plays an equally important role in motivating and sustaining participation. Ethical and privacy issues are inherent to the internet, which comes with certain vulnerabilities and risks related to various stages of a cohort design, including recruitment, advertising, and data collection [7,9]. Targeted advertising (eg, through social media platforms) requires the use of data that might be considered as private (eg, demographics, education) before a person is even aware of a study's existence and long before they consent to participate [33,34]. Along similar lines, showing interest in an online advertised study (eg, by clicking on an advertisement) leaves an online trail that can be easily used by advertising companies for further profiling and targeted commercial advertising [33,34]. The tracking of our online behavior is inherent to the internet; nonetheless, this is challenging from an ethical and privacy perspective, especially in the context of sensitive health research. Further issues may arise from a certain loss of control over advertising, especially if that involves the sharing of advertisements by third parties and through various social media networks. Such uncontrolled spread might lead to losing sight of where a cohort is promoted, as well as of potential comments or questions that might have been posted across the internet [35]. Obtaining informed consent is an essential aspect of recruiting participants in a cohort. When conducted in a face-to-face manner, questions and concerns can be addressed interactively, which is lost if informed consent is obtained online and without individual contact. Filling this gap requires carefully designed online consent procedures that are transparent, understandable, and contain all elements of regular informed consent [36]. Finally, the internet makes it easier for sensitive data to be accessed without authorization, as well as hacked or replicated [33]. Although individual risk can be kept low if data are anonymized, some argue that the ease in which digital information is linked, shared, and merged renders all data potentially identifiable or traceable [37]. Therefore, adequate security features that keep risk at a minimum are inevitable [7]. Some of these features include robust password protections, high-standard information technology security, encrypted communication and data transfer, strict access controls, data deidentification, as well as the separation of personal information and unidentifiable data [7]. The emphasis on security also increases the responsibility that participants themselves have to carry, including adequate password protection, correct communication with study sites, and ensuring that devices and software are up to date.
