## (s9) Geographical variations within countries
(p9.0) Variations in stroke epidemiology have been found within many countries. Studies in China have shown that the stroke incidence is higher in the northern regions compared to the south, 9 with double the incidence along the stroke belt. 41 In India, on the contrary, the incidence is higher in rural areas. 7 In Thailand, the stroke prevalence is highest in the cities, and then, in a decreasing fashion, in the central, south, north, and northeast regions of the country. 23 Similarly, stroke prevalence was found to be higher in cities and urban areas than in rural regions, in Indonesia. 20 These differences have been attributed to the differences in the risk factors between various regions in the same country. However, there is no difference in the age-standardized stroke mortality between the metropolitan cities of Korea and the other regions in the country. 12
