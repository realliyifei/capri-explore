## (s15) Limitations
(p15.0) Several limitations should be noted when interpreting the findings of this scoping review. Because consumer health informatics has become popularized only over the last decade [31], we focused our review on the literature from 2008 onward. Although our findings suggest that most papers have been published within the last 6 years, it is possible that we might have missed papers outside of this window in our search strategy. In addition, due to our scope of work on Thought Spot [26,27,29], our search was limited to examining interventions designed exclusively for transition-aged youth. Because we excluded papers evaluating interventions for other populations (eg, adults) and disease sites (eg, cardiology), there may have been evidence and guidance on the use of analytics in other areas of health care [25]. Evaluating how analytics is applied in other domains of health care may provide more comprehensive insight into the role of analytics in consumer health informatics. It is also interesting to note that most of the papers included in this review were published in North America and Europe, and there was a lack of studies from other countries, including those in Asia and Africa. An evaluation of how adoption and engagement are measured in studies conducted in other countries is warranted.
