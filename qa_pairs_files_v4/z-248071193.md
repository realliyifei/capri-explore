## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Rates of chronic disease are increasing globally, and represent a significant societal and economic impact due to the curtailment of disease-free years of life [1]. Increased adiposity is a key mediating factor for development of chronic cardio-metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and has experienced a similar upward trajectory, with now approximately 39% of adults worldwide being overweight and 13% having obesity [2]. Further to the other well-known aspects of dietary patterns that impact on weight maintenance, such as the type and amount of foods eaten, the temporal patterns of food consumption is a factor increasingly being considered of importance in the efforts to further understand the aetiology and prevention of obesity. This is in part due to the increased propensity for weight gain observed in those with mis-timed eating patterns, i.e. eating occasions extending in to the night hours, when the body is usually primed for rest [3]. Night shift workers are a case in point, being frequently active and eating at night in the course of their employment, and experiencing higher rates of cardio-metabolic disease [4]. The human body is highly attuned to the cycling of day and night (circadian rhythm), with daily fluctuations in many physiological processes, including insulin sensitivity, occurring in anticipation of this routine environmental change [5]. Mis-timed food intake in relation to the day/night cycle can therefore cause circadian disruption, which has been hypothesised to contribute to the development of obesity and associated cardiometabolic disorders [6].
