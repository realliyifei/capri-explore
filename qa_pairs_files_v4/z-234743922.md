## (s4) Biosynthesis of Carotenoids
(p4.0) Carotenoids are tetraterpenoids composed of eight isoprenes. There are two independent terpenoids biosynthesis pathways in plants, namely, the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway in cytoplasmic and the 2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastid [8]. Both pathways can produce isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylpropenyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are precursors of carotenoids biosynthesis [17,18]. Pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) generate MEP under the catalysis of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) synthase (DXS) and DXP reductoisomerase (DXR) [19]. Additionally, DXS is the first rate-limiting enzyme, and MEP finally formed IPP and DMAPP after a series of enzymatic reactions [20].
## (s9) Anthocyanidins
(p9.0) Given the prominent specificity and high nutritional value of anthocyanidins, they are discussed separately in this section. There are a large number of studies on anthocyanidins, which have different colors compared with other flavonoids. Anthocyanidins appear in different colors that are affected by the basic structure, co-pigmentation, metal ion complexation, and vacuole pH [4]. They make fruits and flowers appear in orange, red, purple, or blue and cooperate with other natural pigments to build gorgeous colors in plants. Proanthocyanidins (Pas) and anthocyanidins come from the same branch of flavonoids biosynthesis pathway, which mainly includes catechins, epicatechins, and their polymers, which are unique reddish-brown substances found in fruits [56]. They also determine the bitterness and astringency of the fruits and their secondary products [57]. So far, more than 600 different anthocyanidins have been identified and widely distributed in at least 27 families, 73 genera, and countless species [58].
