## (s5) Integrins in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and EOC cell migration
(p5.0) Carcinoma cells destined for dissemination oftentimes coexpress epithelial and mesenchymal markers, commonly referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), allowing for a cadherin switch [36,57]. EMT allows ovarian cancer cells to loosen intercellular adhesions between cells contributing to the transition of cells from a primary tumor to shed as single cells or spheroids into the ascites [5,39]. During this EMT process, EOC cells gain enhanced invasive properties, survive in hypoxic conditions, and spread through the abdominal cavity by the peritoneal fluid flow [57,58]. The decrease in cell-cell adhesion and detachment of EOC cells from the primary tumor into the peritoneal cavity is mediated through the integrin-mediated upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and activation of EMT [36]. Clustering of collagen-binding integrins α2β1 and α3β1 on EOC cells leads to the induction of MMP9, which is capable of E-cadherin ectodomain cleavage and cell-cell adhesion loosening in an Src kinase-dependent manner [59]. E-cadherin loss leads to transcriptional upregulation of fibronectin receptor α5β1 integrin, which is essential when spheroids initiate adhesion at a secondary site [60]. Decreased E-cadherin is also accompanied by reductions in occludins, claudins, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), α6β4-integrin and cytokines, all of which act to stabilize tight cell-cell contacts via desmosomes [22]. In a reciprocal fashion, there are increases in vimentin, fibronectin, N-cadherin, β1-and β3-integrins and matrix metalloproteinases [22]. Forced downregulation of E-cadherin in EOC cells increases α5-integrin expression through FAK and ERK1 activities leading to enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin [61]. As expected, these EMT-like changes due to E-cadherin loss promote EOC cell invasive properties required for metastasis [58].
