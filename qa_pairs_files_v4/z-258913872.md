## (s4) MAPK
(p4.0) The MAPK signaling pathway is one of the crucial pathways in the eukaryotic signaling network. It is a critical signaling pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress response under normal and pathological conditions [56]. MAPK can be divided into four subfamilies: ERK, p38, JNK, and BMK1 (ERK5), representing the four classical MAPK pathways. Under normal conditions, mTOR inhibits phosphorylates Atg13 after being activated in the AKT and MAPK signaling pathway, preventing it from interacting with ULK1 and ULK2, and the autophagic response is suppressed [57]. In OS, ROS activates the ASK1 signalosome in the MAPK pathway, which activates its downstream JNK and p38-MAPK pathways, further activating p53 and FOXO, and thereby activating and inhibiting its downstream proapoptotic and antiapoptotic molecules and their regulators [58][59][60].
## (s5) FOXO Axis
(p5.0) The forkhead box transcription factors class O (FOXO) is an essential regulator of various intracellular processes. FOXO1, FOXO3a, and other family members are involved in regulating important processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle, stress resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammation [65]. ROS and other stress stimuli capable of producing ROS can regulate FOXO activation and gene expression at multiple levels [66]. On the one hand, FOXO expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, such as by acting on the upstream regulatory protein of FOXO-like p53 and affecting the regulation of its mRNA by miRNA and HuR. On the other hand, it can also affect the activity, stability, and binding of FOXO to DNA through phosphorylation and acetylation. In addition, ROS can also regulate the activation of FOXO proteins by affecting FOXO transcriptional co-activators. In some pathological conditions related to OS, FOXO overactivation and overexpression can lead to the development of various diseases, such as cancer and diabetes [67]. In the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway, AMPK enhances the expression level of SIRT1 by increasing NAD+ concentration, while SIRT1 regulates apoptosis and autophagy by increasing its transcriptional activity through catalyzing the deacetylation of FOXO1 [68]. mTOR can also be inhibited by the AMPK signaling pathway, leading to the activation of the autophagic response. It has been shown that grape seed proanthocyanidins can activate SIRT1 signaling, leading to the deacetylation of the FOXO1 gene, thus counteracting OS in human GCs and alleviating their autophagy [69,70].
