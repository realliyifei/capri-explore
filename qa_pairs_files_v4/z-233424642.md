## (s8) Difference in Gender
(p8.0) A study carried out among medical students showed a significant gender difference with twice the rate of anxiety among females compared to males (40% versus 20%). 30 Another study in Brazil assessed and compared the frequency and severity of symptoms of anxiety among firstand sixth-year medical students. They found that females were more likely to suffer from anxiety than males. 31 In Saudi Arabia, a cross-sectional study showed a significantly higher rate of psychological morbidities, including anxiety, among premedical, 1st, 2nd and 3rd year female medical students (89.7%) than males (60%); however, no significant differences were found between gender in all other years. 32
