## (s5) Potential Role of Diet-Derived Endotoxins from Animal Foods in CVD Development
(p5.0) It has been recognized in recent years that Western dietary patterns are associated with increased serum endotoxin (e.g., LPS) concentrations [116]. The consumption of animal products likely contributes to this, as animal products, including minced beef, butter, cream, pork, turkey and ice cream, contain appreciable quantities of LPS [117][118][119][120]. These findings are not unexpected, considering LPS is derived from microbes; therefore, foods which facilitate substantial microbial growth and proliferation can contain considerable endotoxin quantities. LPS appears to withstand boiling at 100 • C for up to 30 min, while after this time its TLR4-stimulating activity and subsequent NF-κB induction tends to decrease [118]. Additionally, in conditions meant to simulate the gastric environment, a low pH of 1 induced by hydrochloric acid treatment as well as protease treatment did not reduce LPS-stimulated TLR4-mediated NF-κB induction. Thus, LPS can persist in these foods, even with typical cooking methods and digestion. Further, there is evidence that LPS concentrations may increase as storage time increases, as demonstrated with raw, unpasteurized milk under cold-storage conditions [121].
## (s9) Lipotoxicity of the Endothelium
(p9.0) The enzyme eNOS, produces NO, a potent vasodilator [200]. There are numerous regulatory mechanisms which mediate eNOS activity, including phosphorylation sites, growth factors, protein-protein interactions, shear stress and ROS [200][201][202]. Under lipotoxic conditions, eNOS activity is impaired and NO bioavailability is significantly reduced [203,204]. NO bioavailability can be considered a proxy for endothelial health. Indeed, a reduction of NO drives hypertension, due to increased vasoconstriction [205], and reduced NO is an indicator of pro-atherogenic conditions [206].
