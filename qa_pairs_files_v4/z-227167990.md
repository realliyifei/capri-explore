## (s7) DISCUSSION
(p7.0) An inestimable number of systematic reviews are available; over 40 000 systematic reviews are registered in the PROSPERO alone since its inception and more than a dozen systematic reviews are published daily. [90][91][92] This situation results in overwhelming numbers of available systematic reviews. Hence, OoSR can collect and synthesise the evidence as a whole to create concrete findings. 91 93 A similar situation is also observed with TBL. The rapid development of technology has contributed towards abundant technology development for education purposes and in turn has resulted in many systematic reviews produced pertaining to this topic. However, systematic reviews have limitations where some studies are too homogeneous or focused on a single aspect of either one type of population or a specific technology or outcome. Another drawback is that a certain level of skill is required to retrieve suitable and appropriate articles. Therefore, OoSR could facilitate educators to be quickly informed and to become on par with the current available evidences on a particular topic.
