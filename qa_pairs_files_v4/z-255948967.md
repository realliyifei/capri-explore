## (s19) FCN
(p19.0) Full convolution neural network (FCN) is the basis of image semantics segmentation. At present, almost all semantics segmentation models are based on FCN. FCN first extracts and codes the features of the input image using convolution, then gradually restores the feature image to the size of the input image by deconvolution or up sampling. Based on the differences in FCN network structure, the plant diseases and pests segmentation methods can be divided into conventional FCN, U-net [76] and SegNet [77].

(p19.1) 1. Conventional FCN. Wang et al. [78] presented a new method of maize leaf disease segmentation based on full convolution neural network to solve the problem that traditional computer vision is susceptible to different illumination and complex background, and the segmentation accuracy reached 96.26. Wang et al. [79] proposed a plant diseases and pests segmentation method based on improved FCN. In this method, a convolution layer was used to extract multi-layer feature information from the input maize leaf lesion image, and the size and resolution of the input image were restored by deconvolution operation. Compared with the original FCN method, not only the integrity of the lesion was guaranteed, but also the segmentation of small lesion area was highlighted, and the accuracy rate reached 95.87%. 2. U-net. U-net is not only a classical FCN structure, but also a typical encoder-decoder structure. It is characterized by introducing a layer-hopping connection, fusing the feature map in the coding stage with that in the decoding stage, which is beneficial to the recovery of segmentation details. Lin et al. [80] used U-net based convolutional neural network to segment 50 cucumber powdery mildew leaves collected in natural environment. Compared with the original U-net, a batch normalization layer was added behind each convolution layer, making the neural network insensitive to weight initialization. The experiment shows that the convolutional neural network based on U-net can accurately segment powdery mildew on cucumber leaves at the pixel level with an average pixel accuracy of 96.08%, which is superior to the existing K-means, Random-forest and GBDT methods. The U-net method can segment the lesion area in a complex background, and still has good segmentation accuracy and segmentation speed with fewer samples. 3. SegNet. It is also a classical encoder-decoder structure. Its feature is that the up-sampling operation in the decoder takes advantage of the index of the largest pooling operation in the encoder. Kerkech et al. [81] presented an image segmentation method for unmanned aerial vehicles. Visible and infrared images (480 samples from each range) were segmented using SegNet to identify four categories: shadows, ground, healthy and symptomatic grape vines. The detection rates of the proposed method on grape vines and leaves were 92% and 87%, respectively.

(p19.2) Full convolution neural network (FCN) is the basis of image semantics segmentation. At present, almost all semantics segmentation models are based on FCN. FCN first extracts and codes the features of the input image using convolution, then gradually restores the feature image to the size of the input image by deconvolution or up sampling. Based on the differences in FCN network structure, the plant diseases and pests segmentation methods can be divided into conventional FCN, U-net [76] and SegNet [77].

## (s20) Mask R-CNN
(p20.0) Mask R-CNN is one of the most commonly used image instance segmentation methods at present. It can be considered as a multitask learning method based on detection and segmentation network. When multiple lesions of the same type have adhesion or overlap, instance segmentation can separate individual lesions and further count the number of lesions. However, semantic segmentation often treats multiple lesions of the same type as a whole. Stewart et al. [82] trained a Mask R-CNN model to segment maize northern leaf blight (NLB) lesions in an unmanned aerial vehicle image. The trained model can accurately detect and segment a single lesion. At the IOU threshold of 0.50, the IOU between the baseline true value and the predicted lesion was 0.73, and the average accuracy was 0.96. Also, some studies combine the Mask R-CNN framework with object detection networks for plant diseases and pests detection. Wang et al. [83] used two different models, Faster R-CNN and ask R-CNN, in which Faster R-CNN was used to identify the class of tomato diseases and Mask R-CNN was used to detect and segment the location and shape of the infected area. The results showed that the proposed model can quickly and accurately identify 11 class of tomato diseases, and divide the location and shape of infected areas. Mask R-CNN reached a high detection rate of 99.64% for all class of tomato diseases. Compared with the classification and detection network methods, the segmentation method has advantages in obtaining the lesion information. However, like the detection network, it requires a lot of annotation data, and its annotation information is pixel by pixel, which often takes a lot of effort and cost.

## (s32) Fine-grained identification
(p32.0) First, there is a large difference within the class, that is, the visual characteristics of plant diseases and pests belonging to the same class are quite different. The reason is that the aforementioned external factors such as uneven illumination, dense occlusion, blurred equipment dithering and other interferences, resulting in different image samples belonging to the same kind of diseases and pests differ greatly. Plant diseases and pests detection in complex scenarios is a very challenging task of finegrained recognition [101]. The existence of growth variations of diseases and pests results in distinct differences in the characterization of the same diseases and pests at different stages, forming the "intra-class difference" finegrained characteristics.

(p32.1) Secondly, there is fuzziness between classes, that is, objects of different classes have some similarity. There are many detailed classifications of biological subspecies and subclasses of different kinds of diseases and pests, and there are some similarities of biological morphology and life habits among the subclasses, which lead to the problem of fine-grained identification of "inter-class similarity". Barbedo believed that similar symptoms could be produced, which even phytopathologists could not correctly distinguish [102].
## (s34) Lighting problems
(p34.0) Previous studies have collected images of plant diseases and pests mostly in indoor light boxes [105]. Although this method can effectively eliminate the influence of external light to simplify image processing, it is quite different from the images collected under real natural light. Because natural light changes very dynamically, and the range in which the camera can accept dynamic light sources is limited, it is easy to cause image color distortion when above or below this limit. In addition, due to the difference of view angle and distance during image collection, the apparent characteristics of plant diseases and pests change greatly, which brings great difficulties to the visual recognition algorithm.

## (s35) Occlusion problem
(p35.0) At present, most researchers intentionally avoid the recognition of plant diseases and pests in complex environments. They only focus on a single background. They use the method of directly intercepting the area of interest to the collected images, but seldom consider the occlusion problem. As a result, the recognition accuracy under occlusion is low and the practicability is greatly reduced. Occlusion problems are common in real natural environments, including blade occlusion caused by changes in blade posture, branch occlusion, light occlusion caused by external lighting, and mixed occlusion caused by different types of occlusion. The difficulties of plant diseases and pests identification under occlusion are the lack of features and noise overlap caused by occlusion. Different occlusion conditions have different degrees of impact on the recognition algorithm, resulting in false detection or even missed detection. In recent years, with the maturity of deep learning algorithms under restricted conditions, some researchers have gradually challenged the identification of plant diseases and pests under occluded conditions [106,107], and significant progress has been made, which lays a good foundation for the application of plant diseases and pests identification in real-world scenarios. However, occlusion is random and complex. The training of the basic framework is difficult and the dependence on the performance of hardware devices still exists, we should strengthen the innovation and optimization of the basic framework, including the design of lightweight network architecture. The exploration of GAN and other aspects should be enhanced, while ensuring the accuracy of detection, the difficulty of model training should be reduced. GAN has prominent advantages in dealing with posture changes and chaotic background, but its design is not yet mature, and it is easy to crash in learning and cause model uncontrollable problems during training. We should strengthen the exploration of network performance to make it easier to quantify the quality of the model.
