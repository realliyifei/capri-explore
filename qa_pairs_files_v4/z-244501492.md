## (s1) Long-Chain PFAS
(p1.0) Per-and Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals that contain at least one perfluoroalkyl group (Birru et al., 2021). Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are the most common PFAS detected in the environment due to their widespread use in manufacturing and chemical stability (Huang and Jaff√©, 2019). Both PFOS and PFOA are considered long-chain PFAS because they possess an eightcarbon backbone; their functional groups are sulfonate and carboxylate, respectively (Tsuda, 2016). They possess both hydrophobic and oleophobic properties, along with other chemical characteristics making them useful in many consumer goods (Birru et al., 2021). Their carbon-fluorine bonds, make them resistant to degradation and allow them to persist in the environment and bioaccumulate within living organisms (Zeng et al., 2019;Neagu et al., 2021).
