## (s8) Feature Methods.
(p8.0) Feature methods extract features of interests, e.g., sinks, sources, saddle points, vortices, and regions of abnormal flow velocity, in vector fields. We cover specialized methods for medical fluid flows; for other vector field data, we refer the readers to a general overview of texture-based vector field visualization [43]. Extracting vor-tex regions is a vital process in a number of vector medical image visualization techniques [52,53]. Vortex cores in blood vessels are related to blood transportation mechanisms in the aorta and the left ventricle [53]. Vortex regions are extracted for analysis of potential malfunctions [52].
## (s9) 3.2.4.
(p9.0) Techniques for Improved Spatial Perception. Spatial perception of path geometry, lines or tubes, is difficult in 3D due to many factors, e.g., cluttering, inaccurate depth perception, occlusion, and inaccurate perception of orientation. Methods that improve spatial perception are available to complement aforementioned visualization techniques (Sections 3.2.1-3.2.3). Particles in the flow field can be drawn as different shaped glyphs [52] or cartoon-styled stretched ellipsoids or short pathlines (pathlets) [49]. Drawing whole extracted lines as illuminated streamlines [57] or with halos [58,59] is another strategy for visualization with enhanced spatial perception.
