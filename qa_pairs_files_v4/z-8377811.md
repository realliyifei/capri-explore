## (s4) Breast cancer
(p4.0) In primary human cancers, structural alterations of centrosomes have been first systematically studied in specimens of high grade metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. Several centrosome defects, including an increase in centrosome number and volume, with chaotic subcellular locations, accumulation of excessive PCM, supernumerary centrioles, as well as inappropriate accumulation of phosphocentrin during non-mitotic phases are frequently observed. In addition, breast tumour cells display functional centrosome abnormalities, as characterized by unusually large arrays of microtubules nucleated by an increased number of MTOCs [25]. Ultrastructural analysis of centrosomes via electron microscopy revealed that breast tumour cells contain numerous large centrioles surrounded by abundant densely-stained PCM, disrupted centriole barrel structure (open-ring and missing triplet microtubules), unincorporated microtubule complexes, centrioles of unusual length, centrioles functioning as ciliary basal bodies, and mispositioned centrioles [25,26]. Interestingly, tumours with excess PCM are highly anaplastic, lack normal cell polarity, and tend to have a higher median frequency of abnormal mitoses compared to tumours with other centrosome abnormalities [26].
## (s9) Ovarian and testicular cancers
(p9.0) In ovarian adenocarcinoma, near-tetraploid tumours, which display greater numerical CIN, possess a higher degree of intratumoural CA; whereas near-diploid tumours show fewer abnormal centrosomes and comparatively lower numerical but higher degrees of structural CIN [102,103]. This implicates upon two distinct but possibly inter-related mechanisms for the generation of chromosomal aberration in ovarian carcinoma -one via copy-number instability associated with mitotic segregation abnormalities, cytokinesis errors and CA, and the other through structural change possibly as a result of impaired DNA repair [103]. Of clinical relevance, the prognostic significance of CA in ovarian cancer is demonstrated by its association with higher stage, histological grade, and the more aggressive serous-type compared to endometroid-type tumours [102]. In testicular germ cell tumours, those with aneuploidy are frequently associated with CA. Aneuploid seminomas and non-seminomas (including carcinoma-in-situ and infantile yolk sac tumours) show increased numbers of centrosomes. In contrast, the occurrence of CA in diploid infantile teratomas is less frequent [104].
## (s18) Kaposi sarcoma
(p18.0) The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) has been linked with several human malignancies, including all subtypes of Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. Kaposi sarcoma lesions are latently infected by KSHV and express latent genes, such as KSHV cyclin (K cyclin) and latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Expression of K cyclin in human endothelial cells induces senescence and strong DNA damage response, leading to CA and S-phase arrest through a CDK6 and ATM-Chk2-dependent pathway [168]. In human and mouse primary fibroblasts, K cyclin expression results in a p53-dependent growth arrest, abortive cytokinesis and centrosome accumulation [169]. In the absence of p53, the K cyclin-induced CA is exacerbated, leading to the acquisition of an aneuploid population of cells which is not only genetically unstable but also resistant to apoptosis [169]. In line with these findings, in vivo studies demonstrated accelerated K cyclin-induced lymphomagenesis in mice without p53 [170]. Notably, KSHV infection of endothelial cells generates supernumerary centrosomes and multinucleation [168,171], suggesting that the hindrance of tumour progression due to p53-triggered growth arrest and apoptosis may be overcome by other latent viral genes. Indeed, LANA is able to bind p53 and inhibits the ability of p53 to transactivate cellular genes, resulting in abnormal centrosomes, multinuclear cells, and other genomic abnormalities [172]. In KSHV-infected cells, NPM1 is a phosphorylation substrate for CDK6/K cyclin necessary for centrosome duplication, and p53-driven apoptosis occurring downstream of NPM1 phosphorylation is a critical checkpoint mechanism that prevents accumulation of cells with supernumerary centrosomes, which may be overcome by LANA co-expression [173].
