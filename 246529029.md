Turk J Urol. 2022; 48(1): 1-10 ABSTRACT Objective: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the commonest surgical procedure for the treatment of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). Bipolar-TURP (BTURP) is being increasingly used as compared to the long-established Monopolar TURP (MTURP). In this systematic review, we compared the outcomes of BTURP vs MTURP.Material and methods: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane library using relevant search terms from inception of databases till June 2020. Using PRISMA methodology, 18 randomized control trials were reviewed comparing MTURP vs BTURP with a total of 8,393 patients.Results: A significant drop in serum sodium was seen in four studies in MTURP vs BTURP and while there was zero incidence of TUR syndrome in BTURP group, there were 1-16 episodes of TUR syndrome across studies in the MTURP group. A significant fall in hematocrit was seen in three of nine studies with MTURP and one with a significant difference in blood transfusion rates. There were no significant differences in the incidence of clot retention across the studies with 1-5 cases in BTURP group vs 2-12 cases in MTURP group. There were no significant differences related to the duration of catheterization, operative time, resection volume, length of stay, quality of life, postoperative urethral stricture, and sexual function.Conclusion: Although both BTURP and MTURP improve urinary symptoms, BTURP is associated with less risk of hyponatremia, TUR syndrome, and blood loss compared to MTURP. There seems to be no significant difference in length of stay, urethral stricture, quality of life, and operative duration.

## Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition witnessed in men with increasing age. The incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary (LUTS) to BPH affects about 3% of men between 45 and 49 years of age rising to above 30% in men over 80 years of age as found by Speakman et al 1 LUTS is often defined by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) filled out by patients, wherein a score of 0 to 7 indicates mild symptoms, 8 to 19 indicates moderate symptoms, and 20 to 35 indicates severe symptoms.

As we make advances in medicine to help improve longevity and quality of life, we anticipate encountering more men with advancing age with troublesome LUTS owing to BPH. Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) was first introduced in 1930s as an endoscopic advancement to aid in surgical management as compared to the more invasive open prostatic adenectomy that was the historical surgical option for the management of BPH. As we all now know, TURP is considered the mainstay for surgical management of BPH. Depending upon patient wishes, medical therapy is often offered to patients in the form of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors to reduce disease burden and/or alpha-1 antagonists to help with symptomatic management. With time, the benefit offered becomes limited, as physiological progression and surgical intervention are often required. Bipolar TURP (BTURP) was introduced as an alternative to Monopolar TURP (MTURP). In this systematic review, we want to compare the outcomes of BTURP compared to MTURP.


## Material and Methods


## Search Strategy

Our review database was inclusive of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane library. The search terms included: "BPH," "BPO," "LUTS," "MIST," "Monopolar vs Bipolar," "TURP," "Monopolar TURP," "Bipolar TURP," and "Prostate." The identified studies were examined to find any further potential studies for inclusion. Only papers published in English language that compared outcomes of both BTURP and MTURP have been included in this review ( Table 1). The search period was from the inception of • MTURP has a greater incidence of hyponatremia and TUR syndrome.

• MTURP has a higher incidence of fall in hematocrit and blood transfusion.

• There is no significant difference between MTURP and BTURP regarding length of stay, urethral stricture, quality of life, and operative duration.

• Findings from this review suggest that BTURP should be adopted as the standard of care.

databases till June 2020. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the papers are included in Table 2.  • Neurogenic bladder.
Inclusion
• Bladder stones.

In total, 18 papers were included 2-18 based on the selection criteria ( Figure 1).


## Data Collection

Following variables were extrapolated from the 18 included studies. Author, year of publication, country of study, study type and randomized/nonrandomized trial as level of evidence, number of patients included, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and clinical outcomes with and without significance. The above were collected on Microsoft excel and the outcomes have been summarized in a narrative fashion. Table 1 includes all the included papers. As the data were heterogeneous with various studies comparing different outcomes, the outcomes have been represented in a narrative and tabular fashion.


## Results

A total of 18 were selected based on our inclusion criteria as per the PRISMA checklist. Of the 18 studies, 14 studies demonstrate an advantage of bipolar BTURP compared to MTURP. The following results pertain to our findings from the review.


## Comparison of Fluid Re-Absorption and Serum Sodium with Associated Transurethral Resection (TUR) Syndrome

The studies discussing fluid reabsorption and postoperative serum sodium levels also looked at evidence of TUR syndrome, which was increasingly rare ( Figure 1, Table 3). The pathophysiology behind TUR syndrome is the absorption of irrigation fluid through peri-prostatic channels created intraoperatively during resection. This could be attributed to the surgeon's awareness, gland volume, and resection time.

Several studies have been performed to quantify and compare the significance of fluid reabsorption in association with serum sodium levels and the concurrent occurrence of TUR  Komura et al 12 also showed lack of any TUR syndromes in both arms despite a significant fall in serum sodium in MTURP as compared to BTURP. Méndez-Probst et al 8 showed asymptomatic hyponatremia in 19% and 4.5% patients in MTURP and BTURP arm respectively, but this was not statistically significant.


## Fall in Hematocrit and Blood Transfusions

Hemorrhage is a known complication of TURP. The hypothesis behind BTURP causing less intra-/postoperative hemorrhage is that it has a local "cut and seal" mechanism rather than the current passing through the patient's body. This in turn should be reducing the need for blood transfusion. Studies analyzed these with the outcome pointing toward BTURP having a reduced need for blood transfusion as compared to MTURP (Figure 1).

Of the 11 studies, one 7 showed a significantly higher blood transfusion with MTURP. 2,3,6-9,12-15,17 A significant fall in hematocrit was seen in three 3,5,7 of the nine studies with MTURP. 2,3,[5][6][7][8]12,14,15 Although there were no significant differences in the incidence of clot retention across the two groups, 5,12,13,17 between 1-5 cases were recorded in BTURP group and between 2-12 cases were recorded in MTURP group across studies. Table 4 shows in a tabular manner the findings from all the papers.

Alexander et al 19 from their study suggest that there is a possibility of reduced need for blood transfusion with a risk ratio of 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.59. Fagerstrom et al 7 found a statistically significant reduction in total blood loss with a P value of <.001 with mean blood loss of 855 mL and 472 mL in MTURP and BTURP, respectively. Yoon et al 2 found that 3.8% and 2% patients of MTURP and BTURP, respectively, needed re-surgery due to ongoing hemorrhage, but statistical significance was not available for this.  MTURP arm or BTURP arm was not specified. Komura et al 12 found a statistically significant reduction in indwelling catheter duration in BTURP arm as compared to MTURP with 20.6 hours (SD 8.8) vs 35.8 hours (SD 54.6) (P ¼ .042), with a significant reduction in length of stay (3.4 days vs 2.4 days, P ¼ .045). Yee et al 14 compared LOS against age, prostate volume, preoperative foley catheter, and surgical intervention, and only the surgical group had significance with an odds ratio of 3.13 with a confidence interval of 95% and P ¼ .002. These three studies 6,12,14 found a statistically significant shorter LOS for BTURP patients as compared to MTURP patients. Méndez-Probst et al 8 found that seven patients from the BTURP arm were discharged on the same date of surgery as compared to three in MTURP arm, but this was not statistically significant.

It is difficult to comment on the global cost-effectiveness of the two technologies due to differing health services in different countries as is acknowledged above.


## Urethral Strictures and Bladder Neck Stenosis

Tefekli et al 21 suggested the possibility of BTURP causing higher stricture incidence in comparison to MTURP, but this was not supported in the current review. Hueber et al 22 compared the outcomes in 43 men 6 months postoperatively and stated that they did not find any significant difference between the two groups. Mamoulakis et al 11 found that 12 of 121 patients (9.9%) from MTURP arm vs 20 of 135 (14.8%) from BTURP required re-intervention (P ¼ .32) in short-term follow-up. Of the nine papers that mention postoperative urethral stricture and bladder neck stenosis (BNS), only one 13 had a significant rise in urethral structure in BTURP group (P ¼ .002).


## IPSS score and QoL (Quality of Life) Assessment

The effect of BPH is measured via IPSS score which the patients fill out along with a QoL assessment. These help guide the clinicians toward the need for intervention and assess postoperative quality of intervention. Eight studies focused on the IPSS, Qmax, Uroflow, and PVR outcomes post TURP surgery and compared the findings between MTURP and BTURP. This differed between 3-6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months in various studies.

Of the studies included, there was only some significant difference in early IPSS scores, Qmax, Uroflow, and PVR lasting 3-6 weeks, but this was not statistically significant according to Skolarikos et al 6 Beyond this, there was not any significance in difference of improvement in symptoms for patients in both arms. Fagerstrom et al 7 showed that recovery occurred quicker in BTURP as compared to MTURP when compared at 3 and 6 weeks, (P < .05). But at 18 months, they canceled each other out and the outcomes were equivocal. Stucki et al 13 mention no significant difference in IPSS score improvement in MTURP and BTURP arms with both arms showing individual improvement in IPSS scores on a follow-up at 3 and 12 months. The longest follow-up was at 48 months in Autorino et al 4 but this showed no difference in improvement, and therefore, there does not seem to be the need for longer follow-up to assess the difference in improvement between the two available options.


## Sexual Function Improvement Postop

Sexual function is often quantified by IIEF-15 score which contains five domains (with scores ranging from 0-30). This includes Erectile Function (EF) (1-30), Orgasmic Function (OF) (0-10), Sexual Desire (SD)(2-10), Intercourse satisfaction (IS) (0-15), and Overall satisfaction (OS) (2-10). We only found three studies that compared the sexual function using IIEF scores in patients.

El-Assmy et al 18 (from Egypt) used the Ejaculatory domain of Male Sexual-Health questionnaire Ej-MSQH instead to quantify the same which includes seven questions (Ejaculatory frequency, Latency, Volume, Force, Pain, Pleasure, and Dry ejaculate). They did not find any significant difference in improvement in sexual function when compared between the two arms. Demirdag et al 17 found a significant improvement at 6 months using IIEF score, but no comments have been made about FU thereafter. Mamoulakis et al 10 also used IIEF to assess postoperative improvement in sexual function at 12 months and found no statistical difference in improvement between the two arms.


## Operative Time and Resection Volume

The operative time was found to be longer in BTURP as compared to MTURP. This can be attributed to the smaller loop caliber of the BTURP device. Four out of the 14 9,12,14,15 studies found that BTURP takes a longer operative duration as compared to MTURP. But this did not reflect in postoperative morbidity in any observable form. No significant benefit in resection volume even with the increased operative duration was found when BTURP was compared against MTURP. Twelve studies compared this and found no significant difference.


## Other Complications

Fagerstrom et al 7 demonstrated a significance in re-admission after MTURP as compared to BTURP with 14 vs 5 with a P value of <.001, but no other significant findings to support 


## Discussion

We found that BTURP has significantly less reduction in serum sodium postoperatively when compared to MTURP. Various theories have been postulated for this, one of which is that 0.9% Sodium Chloride is a physiological fluid and therefore causes less tissue toxicity and also helps with replacing any fluid losses as stated by El-Assmy et al 18 Also, the "cut and seal" mechanism offered by BTURP which leads to nonpassage of current through patient's body and rather through the loop could cause lesser interaction between irrigating fluid and the microvascular channels created intraoperatively. This could also be attributed to a wider knowledge of TUR syndrome and therefore surgeons being more aware of time restrictions for MTURP.

We also did not find a significant drop in Hematocrit post BTURP, which could also possibly be attributed to the cut and seal mechanism as it helps coagulate while resecting. The concomitant vaporization and hemostasis are also postulated to help improve intraoperative vision as stated by Ene et al 23 There have been concerns about BTURP causing more thermal injury and therefore causing a higher risk of urethral strictures.

Abdelwahab et al 24 found an incidence of 11% in their randomized prospective trial with BTURP. Méndez-Probst et al 8 compared tissue with thermal injury and classified it as degree of thermal artifact in resected tissue as: grade I: 0% injury, grade II: <25% injury, grade III: 25%-50% injury, grade IV: 50%-75% injury, and grade V: >75%. They compared BTURP with MTURP in a randomized prospective trial and found no significant difference in thermal injury in both the arms. We did not find any significant increase in urethral strictures or bladder neck injury between the two arms in our review.

Komura et al 12 used only one surgeon for all their cases to remove surgeon bias and found an increase in operative time with BTURP, but this again did not translate into any significant drop in hemoglobin, serum sodium levels, or need for peri-operative transfusions. Although our study found an increase in operative time with BTRUP as compared to MTURP, it did not reflect in any of the postoperative outcomes and so the increased time did not make a difference in the postoperative outcome.

BTURP offers certain advantages when compared to MTURP with regard to drop in serum sodium and fall in hematocrit, although it did not always translate to a difference in clinical outcomes. It seems that perhaps more needs to be done to assess the cost-effectiveness, reimbursement, and quality of life considering it is different across various parts of the world. Although the paper includes randomized control trials comparing both BTURP And MTURP, there are certain limitations of the paper. A formal risk of bias assessment was not carried out and some papers had a certain aspect of outcomes missing with a degree of heterogeneity of the included study endpoints. There is global variation regarding length of stay, reimbursements, and personal practices with regard to the duration of indwelling catheter which have not been looked at in the paper. As with any comparative study on technology assessment, there will also be an inherent publication bias which has not been appraised in the paper. The heterogeneity of the included study endpoints

In conclusion, both BTURP and MTURP improve urinary symptoms, although BTURP is associated with less risk of hyponatremia, TUR syndrome, and blood loss compared to MTURP, Figure 2 gives a summary of these findings. There does not seem to be any significant difference in length of stay, urethral stricture, quality of life, and operative duration between these two procedures.

syndrome. Most of these studies have demonstrated a minimal incidence of TUR syndrome.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] A significant drop in serum sodium was seen in four studies in MTURP arm compared to BTURP 5,6,12,15 while there was a zero incidence of TUR syndrome in the BTURP group, there were 1-16 episodes of TUR syndrome mentioned across studies in the MTURP group.6,8,9,13,14,17 Karadeniz et al 16 used mannitol in MTURP and 0.9% NaCl in BTURP, the favorable point toward normal saline is that it is a physiological fluid which may contribute to fewer cases of TUR syndrome. MTURP had statistically significant hyponatremia which was not found in BTURP. Two cases of MTURP had TUR syndrome with the lowest serum sodium of 111 and 119 mmol/L. Statistically significant serum sodium drop in MTURP did not always translate to statistically significant incidence of TUR syndrome as shown in the paper by Chee Kong et al 3 Sarma Madduri et al15 commented that BTURP reduces TUR syndrome incidence by a relative risk of 0.17.Fagerstrom et al 7 added ethanol in irrigation fluid for accuracy in measurement of re-absorption and this was assessed by routine intraoperative breath analysis. The procedures were terminated when uptake was detected in two and four patients in BTURP and MTURP, respectively. Three patients from MTURP arm developed TUR syndrome with symptoms of arterial pressure drop, abdominal pain, and headache. Chen et al 5 did not demonstrate any TUR syndrome despite a more pronounced fall in serum sodium in MTURP reflecting more fluid re-absorption. This was also noticed in Stucki et al 13 where 6 of 67 and 2 of 70 procedures of MTURP and BTURP, respectively, were terminated due to fluid uptake measured by breath analysis of ethanol. Demirdag et al 17 demonstrated a significant fall in serum sodium in MTURP, but not in BTURP, and two patients in MTURP arm went on to develop TUR syndrome, while none had it in the BTURP group.
