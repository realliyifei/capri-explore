The Effects of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions on COVID-19 Cases, Hospitalizations, and Mortality: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-analysis
5A0B5D0481F755DC0ED2BA29E257086E10.1016/j.focus.2023.100125
Introduction: This review aimed to assess the effects of various nonpharmaceutical interventions on cases, hospitalizations, and mortality during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: To empirically investigate the impacts of different nonpharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19−related health outcomes, a systematic literature review was conducted.The effects of 10 nonpharmaceutical interventions on cases, hospitalizations, and mortality across 3 periodic lags (2, 3, and ≥4 weeks after implementation) were studied.Articles measuring the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions were sourced from 3 databases by May 10, 2022, and risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.Results: Across the 44 papers, the authors found that policy stringency corresponded to decreased per capita mortality across all lags (−0.13, −0.24, and −0.24 per 100,000, respectively).Masks were associated with mitigative effects on both cases (−2.76 per 100,000) and deaths (−0.19 per 100,000), whereas restaurant closures and travel restrictions corresponded to decreased mortality.Shelter-in-place orders suggested later impacts (after 2 weeks) on cases (−2.9 per 100,000).Although limited gatherings and school and business closures corresponded to reduced per capita mortality in 2 or 3 weeks, or both, their impacts diminished after 4 weeks.The 3 nonpharmaceutical interventions studied in hospitalizations showed negative estimates.Discussion: When assessing the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions, considering the duration of effectiveness after implementation has paramount significance.Although some nonpharmaceutical interventions may reduce the COVID-19 impact, others can disrupt the mitigative progression of containing the virus after 3 weeks.Policymakers should be aware of both the scale of their effectiveness and duration of impact when adopting these measures for future COVID-19 waves.

## INTRODUCTION

To control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many governments began implementing containment measures in the hopes of limiting the spread of the virus, reducing the burdens on healthcare systems, and minimizing the death toll.Although some countries (like Sweden) turned toward a more laissez-faire herd immunity approach, others adopted containment measures, known as nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).Unlike pharmaceutical interventions, such as medication and vaccination, 1 NPIs aim at limiting mobility and reducing contact to mitigate the severity of a virus' impact; these range from measures that seek to curb transmissions (i.e., closing of public spaces, gathering bans, masking requirements) to stricter mandates that impose restrictions on personal liberties (i.e., shelter-inplace orders [SIPOs], curfews).

During the first wave (January 2020−June 2020), the unprecedented rapid spread of COVID-19 sparked varied responses from around the world-each country was reacting in a way that they believed to be most effective.Still, there is much debate as to which NPIs are most impactful in mitigating the COVID-19 burden on related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.This information can be extremely valuable to policy makers and government officials facing future waves of the pandemic and other viral outbreaks.

One literature review by Herby and colleagues 2 sought to address these issues by analyzing the effects of various NPIs on mortality during the first wave, ultimately concluding that they are not an effective way of reducing mortality rates during a pandemic.Although this may be the case, the authors looked to extend their research by including 2 additional variables that may have influenced the government responses: cases and hospitalizations.Although deaths are the most extreme of the 3 variables, infections and hospital capacities were being monitored throughout the pandemic, and their progression following the imposed measures should not be overlooked.Mendez-Brito and colleagues 3 studied the association between 15 NPIs and COVID-19 health outcomes; however, their analyses used the proportion of papers that found these measures to be mitigative, rather than the proportion of cases, hospitalizations, or deaths averted.Ge et al. 4 studied the effects of various NPIs on transmission across waves.As time went on, governments and the public became more experienced in transmission mitigation, therefore their paper may have captured some behavioral aspects that cannot be fully attributed to the NPIs themselves.In their review, Patiño-Lugo and colleagues 5 studied the roles of various NPIs containing the virus, and although they did acknowledge cases, mortality, and the hospital burden, they did not quantify how effective NPIs were in mitigating these outcomes.Estimating the effects of NPIs does present some challenges: the literature differs not only in the methodology used, but also in the way that effectiveness is reported, making it difficult to compare findings across studies.In contrast to Herby et al., 2 who converted findings from the literature into common percentage estimates, this review grouped studies by the metrics used for reporting to compare like results.This allowed the review to consider articles that were excluded from that of Herby and colleagues, 2 namely those studying growth rates and per capita effects.

In this paper, the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effects of 10 NPIs on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and mortality (Table 1) to determine which measures were most effective in mitigating the pandemic's burden on health outcomes during the first wave.This research extends the previous literature by analyzing these output variables across 3 reporting metrics (cumulative, growth rate, and per capita effects) at 3 points in time (2, 3, and ≥4 weeks after NPI implementation).In none of the reviews the authors consulted considered time lags.Relevant articles were obtained through an extensive search and selective screening process that refined the sample to just qualified papers.Once complete, the articles were assessed individually, and the estimated effects of NPIs were collected from the available material.


## METHODS

As outlined in Figure 1, a multistep procedure was used to obtain the relevant literature.Figure 1 describes the eligibility criteria and search and screening process that led to the inclusion of 44 papers in this review.


## Eligibility Criteria

A set of requirements were established to determine the articles that would be included in this literature review.In this section, those definitions are elaborated and any notable exceptions are discussed.

Assessing the effect of NPIs on cases, hospitalizations, and mortality.Most importantly, for a paper to be considered in this review, its abstract must indicate that a relationship between NPIs and at least one of the specified output variables was studied.Studies that mainly identified trends or correlations, focused on more implicit factors (like government effectiveness 6 ), or simply did not quantify the effect of NPIs on the outputs were excluded.Studies that reported effects exclusively in terms of other measures, such as the reproduction number or risk ratio, were also excluded.Although the former was used throughout the literature, it differs from reported cases in that it describes the "average number of secondary infected cases generated by a primary infected individual" 7 .There were 2 exceptions to this criterion: Tsai et al., 8 whose work was included in the review of Herby and colleagues 2 (but not in their meta-analysis), and Kwok et al., 9 who used the reproduction number as their primary output but reported some estimates in terms of cases and mortality.

Having sufficient observations and jurisdictional relevance.This review excluded studies that conducted their analyses on few observations, reflecting little jurisdictional relevance.Although some policies were imposed at the state-or even city-level, the related research would not allow the authors to draw general conclusions on effectiveness of NPI.The excluded papers, therefore, focused on specific cities (Mexico City 10 ), counties (Bexar County, Texas 11 ), or states (North Carolina 12 ).Analyses based on entire countries or geographic regions were included.One exception to this was the study by de Souza Melo and colleagues 13 who observed the state of São Paulo, Brazil; which has population greater than that of Canada.Papers performing comparative analyses-like Gallic et al. 14 who contrasted countries taking a herd immunity approach to those adopting a crushing the curve strategy-were also excluded.These studies explored relative policy effectiveness, and thus, did not provide usable estimates for this meta-analysis.

Focusing on NPIs implemented during the first wave.The study period of interest for this review were the months surrounding the first wave of the pandemic.Although the exact dates vary between sources, most of the literature agrees that the first wave spanned from January 2020 to June 2020.Throughout subsequent waves, the behaviors of both individuals and governments in response to the pandemic had changed; the general population had become accustomed to distancing (and even adopted protective measures themselves), and government decision-makers had garnered insight into what policies might be more successful in handling this virus.Thus, in the later waves, it would be difficult to isolate the effects of NPIs without capturing some behavioral factors.If multiple waves were considered, those that failed to analyze the first wave separately were removed from candidacy.On a similar note, studies that looked to forecast the effects of NPIs on outcomes in future waves were also removed; however, this consisted of only 2 studies.Similar to Herby and colleagues, 2 this review also excluded studies that focused exclusively on the timing of NPIs without assessing their effects on the outputs.

Studying mandated NPIs, rather than related policies and recommendations.Articles that did not explicitly study NPIs (as per our definitions) were removed from candidacy.These included all papers looking at emergency declarations and easing and reopening strategies.Moreover, studies that examined any form of government recommendation were excluded, because these measures rely too heavily on voluntary behavior.One study (Moore et al. 15 ) was removed from the pool because it looked at NPIs alongside vaccinations, which would contradict the timeline of this review's study period as vaccines were unavailable until December 2020-months after the first wave ended.

Synthetic control studies, simulated data, and theoretical scenarios.Although the authors would have liked to consider synthetic control studies separately, they only ended up with 3 following the screening process.Because of this small sample size, those studies were excluded from candidacy.Adjacent to this were those using simulated data and those analyzing hypothetical pandemic scenarios.The authors chose to exclude the paper based on simulated infections because it would not allow for drawing conclusions on the actual experienced effectiveness of NPIs.Studies that analyzed hypothetical responses were excluded from the pool because they took a what-if approach, which would not allow for measuring the observed impacts of governmental responses.

Other reasons for exclusion.It should be noted that 6 duplicates, 8 descriptive studies, 1 literature review, and 8 articles not written in English were also excluded during this process.Although the non-English studies did appear during this review's initial search, only their titles were translated and the articles themselves were in another language.


## Article Acquisition and Screening

The articles used in this study were all sourced from 1 of the 3 databases: Elsevier (Scopus), EBSCO (LISTA), and PubMed.These databases were searched across title and abstract using a query containing 3 strings: a disease string (covid, coronavirus, corona, or sars-cov-2), a response string (measure(s), restriction(s), intervention (s), order(s), policy, or policies), and an output string (case(s), hospitalization(s), death(s), mortality, mortalities, fatality, or fatalities).

The database search, which concluded on May 10, 2022, yielded a total of 40,815 unique articles.To ensure that the query was thorough enough, the authors crossreferenced these results with the eligible studies included in Table 1 of the review by Herby and colleagues. 2 Having used a common source (Scopus) with more inclusive search terms, the authors justifiably expected to find all 34 articles in their initial search; however, only 23 appeared.Upon further investigation, a title search revealed that the 11 missing articles (all working papers) were unavailable in the databases used for this review.Herby et al. 2 used Google Scholar, which could explain why they did not appear.These 11 papers were added to the initial sample.

One researcher was involved in screening.First, the 40,826 papers were screened manually by title, and only 1,813 studies potentially related to the research area were kept.The refined sample qualified for a screening by abstract, where the authors looked to answer the question: Does the article assess the effect of NPIs on cases, hospitalizations, mortality, or two or more of these?All papers for which the authors could answer yes were kept in the pool.After this step, only 183 articles remained, qualifying them for a deeper analysis and careful assessment of their eligibility.Here, each study was reviewed to determine whether it met the basic requirements to be used in these analyses.In short, papers that reported and quantified the effects of NPIs on the desired outputs, used real-world (nonsimulated) data, and focused on the first wave of the pandemic were sought.Following the final screening process, the authors were left with their final set of 82 candidate papers.Although the 82 papers were analyzed in detail, not all were eligible for the meta-analysis.


## Estimating the Effects of NPIs

Following the screening process, the 82 included studies were then reviewed for inclusion in the meta-analysis by 2 researchers.The articles were coded in a spreadsheet where outputs, containment measures, periods of study, methodologies, data sources, study regions, and levels of analyses were reported (Appendix Table 1, available online).Throughout the revision, 38 studies were identified that did not provide usable estimates.Although the authors might have been expected to exclude these in the previous step, their ineligibility was not apparent simply from reading the abstracts.The authors were less restrictive during the screening process to capture as many qualified articles as possible.

Estimates for the 44 papers included in the meta-analysis were obtained from various tables and figures.The authors studied the outputs across 10 NPIs that were divided into 2 groups for analysis (Table 1): collective and specific measures.Collective measures consisted of NPIs overall and government stringency.Overall NPIs comprised papers studying country-specific responses (like South Africa's Level 5 lockdown 16 ) and grouped NPIs for measuring a collective effect, whereas government stringency referred to those using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) index.The authors also looked at papers focusing on the isolated effects of ≥1 of the 8 specific NPIs: SIPOs, social distancing, mask use, limited gatherings, non-essential business closures, bar/restaurant closures, school closures, and travel restrictions/border closures.

Because each paper took a different approach in reporting NPI effectiveness, we compared studies across 3 reporting metrics: cumulative, growth rate, and per capita effects.The former 2 were presented as percentages; however, the authors sought to distinguish between those expressed in terms of total change and those expressed as changes in daily growth rates.Per capita effects-the number of new cases, hospitalizations, or deaths per 100,000 population-were the preferred metric in these analyses.Unlike percentages (which are relative), per capita effects conform to a universal standard that is consistent across studies and is independent of the population.

To compare the timely effects of NPIs, the authors reported their estimates across lag periods of 2, 3, and ≥4 weeks since implementation.In accordance with previous research, 17 the authors decided not to include a 1week lag because the effects of containment measures are most often noticeable 2 weeks after implementation.It should also be noted that, if a study did not report their results for 14, 21, or 28 days, the estimate that most closely aligned with the specified lag periods were taken.

To address risk of bias in this selection of articles, the authors employed the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, in which 1 reviewer performed risk of bias assessments and a second reviewer verified all assessments.


## RESULTS

In this section, the main findings from our meta-analysis are presented.The authors provide a descriptive assessment in section 3.1, followed by the results for cases, hospitalizations, and mortality in the following sections 3.2 to 3.4, respectively.The unweighted average estimates across all 3 quality dimensions are reported in Table 2, 13,16−57 whereas the high quality estimates alone are reported in Table 3. 20,23−25,27,29,31,33,34,39,41,42,46 −48,50,51,53,55−57 The authors have moderate confidence in the results reported in Table 2. 13,16−57 Because this presented the estimates across all quality dimensions, it captures both the fair and poor quality papers (reported separately in Appendix Tables 2 and 3, respectively, available online).For that reason, the authors' confidence is higher in the findings of Table 3, 20,23 −25,27,29,31,33,34,39,41,42,46−48,50,51,53,55−57 which are used as the primary source of findings of this review.The superscripts presented in Tables 2, 13,16−57 and 3, 20,23 −25,27,29,31,33,34,39,41,42,46−48,50,51,53,55−57 and Appendix S2 and S3 (available online) denote the papers used to obtain the corresponding estimates.


## Descriptive Analysis

Among the 44 papers, 27 looked at cases, 4 looked at hospitalizations, and 37 looked at mortality.Furthermore, 8 provided estimates for NPIs overall, 10 for stringency, 16 for SIPOs, 4 for social distancing, 7 for mask wearing, 6 for limited gatherings, 7 for business closures, 3 for bar/restaurant closures, 6 for school closures, and 7 for traveling restrictions/border closures.Regarding metrics, per capita estimates appeared most frequently (18 papers), whereas cumulative and growth rate effects were used in 13 and 15 papers, respectively.In terms of the time lags, 2-week effects were reported in 26 papers, 3-week in 22 papers, and ≥4-week in 29 papers.It should be noted that several studies gave estimates for multiple containment measure, outputs, and lag periods.

Using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale allowed the authors to grade papers on the robustness of their data and methods.More importantly, it allowed the authors to determine whether they controlled for covariates (i.e., demographic or country-specific factors), cointervention, or both.Articles that controlled for both were labeled as high quality (21 articles), those that only controlled for 1 of the 2 were labeled as fair quality (16 articles), and those that controlled for neither were labeled as poor quality papers (7 articles).The authors are confident in the results obtained from high quality papers because they controlled for confounders and the effects of other NPIs.Their confidence in fair quality papers is moderate-as they controlled for either covariates or cointervention-but low in poor quality articles.Results were reported both collectively and across quality dimensions.In addition, the 44 papers were based on N ¼ 701; 384 observations.


## Impact on Cases

Collective NPIs.Among papers looking at NPIs overall, case growth rates were associated with reductions of 2.07% and 5.77% across the 2-and 3-week lags.Only 2 studies estimated OxCGRT stringency effects on per capita cases; the authors found that a 1-point increase in stringency corresponded to 0.00033 and 0.00018 fewer cases per 100,000 after 2 and 3 weeks, respectively.Although the early effects are slight, the authors note that the ≥4-week average is heavily influenced by the estimate obtained from Ashraf, 25 who suggested that a marginal increase in stringency leads to almost 0.5 fewer weekly cases per 100,000.Policy stringency also corresponded to a 0.55% reduction in case growth rates after 4 weeks.Specific NPIs.Regarding specific NPIs, per capita estimates were only available for mask wearing and SIPOs.Mask wearing was associated with 2.32, 2.26, and 2.71 fewer cases per 100,000 across the 3 available lags.Although the authors did not obtain per capita estimates for the other 6 NPIs, they turn to the growth rates in Table 3, 20,23−25,27,29,31,33,34,39,41,42,46−48,50,51,53,55−57 to draw some conclusions: SIPOs (−3.09%), masks (−1.16%), limited gatherings (−4.78%), and school closures (−8.38%) all corresponded to decreased case growth rates after 2 weeks, whereas travel restrictions showed reductions after 2 (−8.1%) and 4 (−10.73%)weeks.


## Impact on Hospitalizations

The hospitalizations variable was the least studied of the 3, with estimates being reported in just 4 papers.Consequently, high quality results were only obtained for    ---0.012(0.009, 0.015) 45 OxCGRT stringency −0.02 (−0.05, 0.01) 17 −0.1 (−0.12, −0.07) 17 −0.08 (−0.14, −0.005) 17,46 −0.125 (−0.37, 0.12) 24,47 −0.242 (−0.6, 0.116) 24,47,48 −0.244 (−0.504, 0.017) 24,25,45,47,49,50 SIPOs −59.8 (−76.1, −32.3) 26 −54.66 28 −1.19 (−6.03, 3.66) 29,30,42 −0.44 (−2.92, 2.04) 30,31,42 −0.97 (−3.17, 1.24) 30,33,42 −0.009 (−0.14, 0.122) 27,34,35,51,52 −0.069 (−0.281, 0.142) 27,35,52,53 −0.017 (−0.295, 0.26) 27,35,43,51,52 Social distancing −27.-−0.012 (−0.073, 0.05) 27,52 −0.181 (−0.644, 0.282) 27,52,57 0.021 (−0.001, 0.043) 27,52 Bar/restaurant closures ----−0.170.05 (−0.08, 0.18) 52 Traveling restrictions --−13.98 9 −1.16 (−7.35, 5.04) 29,30 1.75 30 1.5 30 −0.04 (−0.105, 0.025) 52 −0.033 (−0.047, −0.019) 52,53 −0.3 (−0.45, −0.15) 52 Note: The 95% CIs are reported in brackets (when available).Referenced works are indicated by superscripts.NPI, nonpharmaceutical intervention; SIPO, shelter-in-place order.Boldface indicates statistical significance (p<0.05).

SIPOs and mask wearing.As shown in Table 3, 20,23 −25,27,29,31,33,34,39,41,42,46−48,50,51,53,55−57 these interventions were associated with a decrease in cumulative hospitalizations and growth rates, in which SIPOs corresponded to 3.2% and 5.5% lower hospitalization rates in the 3−4 weeks after implementation, respectively.These results align with the per capita estimates, in which Sears and colleagues 43 found hospitalizations reduced by 5.597 per 100,000 after 4 weeks.Additionally, mask wearing was associated with reductions of 2.4%, 2.5%, and 2.1% in the cumulative hospitalization rates across the 3 respective lags.


## Impact on Mortality

Collective NPIs.Although NPIs overall and policy stringency were associated with reduced cases, they did not have the same effect on mortality.Of the 7 studies reporting effects of response stringency on per capita mortality, only 1 (Chisadza et al., 45 also a fair quality paper) linked stricter policies to more deaths, but the 95% CIs included 0, suggesting insignificance.On the other hand, after 4 weeks, stricter policies were associated with 0.04% reductions in mortality rates.

Specific NPIs.Of the 6 NPIs studied in per capita mortality, bar/restaurant closures experienced the largest effects 4 weeks after implementation, corresponding to 1.08 fewer deaths per 100,000.Although we did not find any more evidence of fewer deaths per capita, limited gatherings (−6.41%), business (−5.32%)and school closures (−3.98%) were associated with decreased mortality growth rates after 2 weeks, whereas SIPOs (−1.66%), masks (−1.9%), and school closures (−8.29%) corresponded to reductions after 3 weeks.SIPOs were the only NPI studied at the ≥4-week lag for growth rates and were associated with a 1.95% drop in the mortality rates.Although the authors observed mitigative effects of travel restrictions on case growth rates, this was not the case for mortality.


## DISCUSSION

Because of the manuscript limitations, only 4 tables/figures are presented; however, other related materials of the review can be accessed upon request.These results suggest that the 10 NPIs studied generally corresponded to decreases in case, hospitalization, and mortality rates in the first wave, with some exceptions.In terms of the per capita estimates, 2 NPIs (policy stringency and mask use) were largely associated with fewer cases across the observed lags, whereas bar/restaurant closures corresponded to decreased mortality after 4 weeks.Regarding mortality rates, policy stringency, SIPOs, masks, limited gatherings, and business and school closures all corresponded to negative estimates.By contrast, all NPIs except social distancing and business and restaurant closures were associated with reduced case growth rates.Additionally, the 2 NPIs studied in hospitalizations (SIPOs and mask wearing) showed mitigative effects.

Despite observing mostly mitigative effects across the 3 outputs, it is important to highlight the few instances of increased mortality.Most notably, business closures gave negative point estimates for deaths per capita early on (i.e., before the fourth week), but not later, suggesting that these measures might only have a short-term effect and any prolonged adoption could be either counterproductive or detrimental.Limited gatherings, on the other hand, were associated with increased per capita mortality after 2 and 4 weeks following implementation, hinting that this containment measure may not be effective in lowering the death toll.Spiegel and Tookes 51 attribute this increase in mortality to the fact that such measures may have caused substitution by the public into other types of activities that increase transmission.

Based on this review's findings, the authors highlight the effectiveness of response stringency and measures that limit internal movement (e.g., SIPOs) in mitigating the pandemic's impact.Policy makers, however, should be aware of the challenges in adopting such interventions.It is certain that forcing the population to stay at home would reduce the frequency of encounters with infected individuals, but this depends on mass compliance. 58The authors believe this could be one of the reasons why limited gatherings saw such a high correspondence with cases and mortality; it is difficult for authorities to ensure that individuals are not gathering in secret.Thus, the authors also highlight the importance of public interventions such as increased mask wearing.These NPIs help limit transmission in public spaces, suggesting that countries may not need to halt economic activity (i.e., close businesses and restrict travel) simply to curb the spread of the virus.In fact, these results showed quite the opposite, because business closures and travel restrictions were both, at some point, associated with increased instances of mortality.It is worth mentioning that policy stringency and mask wearing were related to decreased cases per capita but not mortality.One possible explanation for this is that the effect of NPIs is being observed in the number of cases, rather than in mortality.


## Limitations

This research is not without limitations.One shortcoming is that the authors studied these effects across different geographic levels (i.e., countries, continents, and worldwide).Although this does allow a global interpretation of these findings, caution should be exercised with generalization.Some studies observed NPIs that were uniquely implemented in certain regions, like the Portuguese response (Ricoca Peixoto 18 ) and Nordic travel restrictions (Gordon and colleagues 23 ).This should be considered when interpreting these findings because the effects of a lockdown in one country may not yield the same outcomes in other parts of the world.For example, Portugal's approach-although successful -may not have the same impact on a larger country like the U.S.Moreover, because these findings were based on existing studies, factors such as the methodologies used and precision of reported results were outside the control of the authors.

One recommendation for future reviews would be to study the effects of NPIs across countries with a similar socioeconomic composition.This avenue was sparked by the authors' reading of Shiva and Molana, 17 who commented that the impact of workplace closure on fatalities is not universal and depends on a country's economic development level.In studying the interaction between NPIs and regional socioeconomic markers, researchers may be able to uncover deeper explanations for why certain containment measures experience greater success in developed rather than developing countries.


## CONCLUSIONS

The authors studied the effects of 10 NPIs on 3 outcome variables: cases, hospitalizations, and mortality.The meta-analysis was designed to obtain aggregate estimates for the effectiveness of each containment measure on each variable in the 2, 3, and ≥4 weeks following implementation.To minimize the manipulation of results reported in the 44 included studies, the authors provided estimates across 3 metrics commonly used in the literature: cumulative, growth rate, and per capita effects.

In short, the authors found that the NPIs studied were associated with reduced rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.With respect to the per capita metric, policy stringency and mask wearing corresponded to fewer cases, whereas bar/restaurant closures were associated with reduced mortality after 4 weeks.In terms of growth rates, 7 NPIs corresponded with reduced cases, and 5 of these (policy stringency, SIPOs, mask wearing, limited gatherings, and school closures) were also associated with reduced mortality rates.Furthermore, regarding hospitalizations, the 2 NPIs studied (SIPOs and mask wearing) were associated with reducing the healthcare burden.
