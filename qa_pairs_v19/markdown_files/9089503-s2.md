## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The Buckeye Speech Corpus has played a critical role in advancing the study of phonetic variation, particularly through its diverse dataset and applied methodologies in sociolinguistics and machine learning. Compiled from sociolinguistic interviews with speakers from the Columbus, Ohio region, the corpus comprises approximately 357,908 words and includes data from different demographic segments, such as gender and age, which is vital for examining phonetic variation in a controlled context [1] [2].

One of the significant findings from studies utilizing the Buckeye corpus is the illumination of dialectal variation among predominantly white speakers. While the corpus provides a balance between male and female speakers, it is noted that other prominent varieties of English, such as Black English or L2 English, are minimally represented or entirely absent, potentially impacting the performance and applicability of machine learning models trained on this data [3] [4]. This lack of representation raises concerns about overfitting, as models may struggle with speech variations not present in the training set, highlighting challenges in automatic speech recognition systems [4].

Additionally, the corpus facilitates investigations into how various linguistic factors relate to speech production, including word duration, part of speech (PoS) tagging, word frequency, and semantic relevance. Previous studies employing these features have established statistical correlations between these factors and their impact on phonetic characteristics [2]. These relationships further deepen our understanding of the complexities of speech and phonetic variation, allowing researchers to analyze how linguistic elements affect one another in spontaneous speech contexts.

Moreover, the Buckeye Speech Corpus has provided a consistent dataset that was previously lacking in the social and cognitive sciences. By employing both machine learning and statistical analysis, researchers have been able to derive unique insights into phonetic variation and its sociolinguistic implications. This reflects a broader trend where advancements in technology and analytic tools enhance the ability of scientists to analyze data at an unprecedented scale, thereby fostering new discoveries across diverse research domains [3].

In summary, the Buckeye Speech Corpus has significantly contributed to the study of phonetic variation through its diverse dataset and the advanced methodologies used in research. It has unveiled critical insights about dialectal variation and highlighted representation issues in phonetic datasets while supporting the exploration of correlations among various linguistic factors [1] [2] [3] [4].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: a variety of dialect regions. The second corpus was the Buckeye speech corpus, a collection of sociolinguistic interviews with 40 Caucasian speakers from the Columbus, Ohio region [Pitt et al., 2005, 2007].Speakers 27, 38, 39, and 40 were held out from Buckeye to be part of the test set. The held-out speakers ensured that there was one male speaker younger than 30, one female speaker younger than 30, one male speaker older than 40, and one female speaker older than 40. Speaker 4 from Buckeye was held out to be part of the validation set. Of the remaining training data, an additional 5% was randomly held out as additional validation data. The standard TIMIT test set was used, including the sentences designed to elicit dialectal variation.Because the Buckeye recordings were many minutes long each, they were automatically processed into shorter sections. The boundaries between each section were the non-speech noises indicated in the transcriptions, such as laughter, silence, or the
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: conversing freely with an interviewer (Pitt et al., , 2005). The speech has been orthographically transcribed and phonetically labeled. The sessions were conducted as sociolinguistics interviews, and are essentially monologues. The speech has been orthographically transcribed and phonetically labeled. The corpus includes 357908 words.The original dataset from the Buckeye provided diverse factors: speaker’s gender (female, male), age (old, young), word duration, etc. However, we can add more factors such as PoS tag for each word, word length, word frequency, the phrase rate, deletions and semantic relevance. Most of these factors have been investigate to show that they are closely related with word duration (Cowan et al., , 1997; Baker and Bradlow, , 2009; Terroir and Lavandier, , 2014; Cohen Priva, , 2015; Pierrehumbert, , 2016; Bürki, , 2018). However, these relevant research mostly employed statistical correlation and simply linear regression to explore how these factors affect

This study leverages the Buckeye Speech Corpus to illustrate how both machine learning and statistical analysis are applied in data-driven research to obtain distinct insights. This study significantly enhances our understanding of the diverse approaches employed in data-driven strategies.Keywords: data-driven approaches, features, objectives, mixture,1 IntroductionAdvancements in technology have revolutionized the ability of scientists to gather and analyze data on an unprecedented scale. This surge in data availability has led to the necessity for more sophisticated analytical techniques and computational tools, fundamentally changing the way research is conducted and facilitating new discoveries across various domains (Langley, , 1981; Han et al., , 1993; Kitchin, , 2014; Montáns et al., , 2019; Jack et al., , 2018;
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: of dialectal variation represented among predominantly white speakers, and Buckeye has conversational speech balanced between white men and white women. Yet, it is starkly apparent that many common varieties of speech—such as Black English, L2 English, and English as spoken outside of the United States—are barely present or not present at all in the data we trained on. The propensity of machine learning models to overfit on the data they were trained on means it is all but certain that our model will perform worse on these varieties of speech not included in the training data, a common problem in automatic speech recognition [Wassink et al., 2022]. This is an inherent challenge in developing any kind of omnibus forced alignment system because it is nearly impossible to anticipate all possible research scenarios in which a tool will be used. Developing a training interface for forced alignment systems, as has been part of MFA since its inception [McAuliffe et al., 2017], is an important
