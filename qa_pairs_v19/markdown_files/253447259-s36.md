Various methods improve model performance in grammatical error correction (GEC) by augmenting official datasets through several key strategies. One prominent approach involves using a data-driven methodology to create cleaner and more accurate training datasets. This was illustrated in research that demonstrated state-of-the-art results on Turkish GEC test sets by systematically cleaning the data from organic sources [1]. A significant aspect of improving model performance is recognizing that many errors attributed to large language models (LLMs) might stem from mislabeled or erroneous training data rather than genuine model deficiencies [2]. By correcting these label errors during training, researchers reported a marked improvement in the performance metrics of the models, underscoring the importance of data quality [2].

Another strategy involves leveraging different kinds of data sources, such as web-derived data, which diversify the types of grammatical errors present in the training sets. For example, datasets that include essays from both non-native and native speakers have been fundamental in addressing grammatical errors [3]. This variety helps the models learn to generalize better across a broader range of linguistic scenarios. Recent works have further suggested that augmenting datasets with synthetically generated examples, like minimal edits on existing sentences, enhances model robustness against grammatical noise [5]. These approaches help models to adapt to real-world scenarios where users may produce imperfect language.

Additionally, LLMs themselves can be employed to detect and correct grammatical errors more effectively than human annotators, showcasing their superior accuracy, consistency, and cost-efficiency in error detection tasks [4]. As the capabilities of these models evolve, their integration into the data curation process becomes increasingly vital, allowing for ongoing refinement of datasets, which in turn fuels improved model training. 

Researchers are continually encouraged to apply these methodologies to refine existing datasets. They emphasize critically evaluating dataset quality, which can lead to more reliable results in GEC tasks [4]. The combination of augmenting datasets with enriched and cleaned data, utilizing diverse data sources, and employing advanced models for error detection forms a comprehensive approach that strengthens model performance in grammatical error correction systems. Overall, by enhancing the training datasets in these ways, researchers can significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of NLP models when faced with typical errors encountered in natural language use.

We achieve state-of-the-art results on two Turkish Grammatical Error Correction test sets out of the three publicly available ones. We also show the effectiveness of our method on the training losses of training language models.1 IntroductionHumans naturally tend to make typos for various factors. Those typos and grammatical errors propagate to the data used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and any data-related tasks, which could lead to unexpected behavior. For instance, a sentiment analysis text classifier that has been trained with a frequently occurring misspelled word may produce unexpected results when processing correctly spelled words in the input. Another example that we looked into closely is Large Language Models (LLMs) which are trained on massive amounts of data mostly

This suggests that many of the LLMs so-called mistakes are due to label errors rather than genuine model failures. Additionally, we discuss the implications of mislabeled data and propose methods to mitigate them in training to improve model performance.1 IntroductionNatural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks have long served as a cornerstone for advancing the field, providing standardized datasets for training and evaluating methods and models (Wang et al., 2019; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Srivastava et al., 2023; Calderon et al., 2024).These datasets have been developed over the years for various tasks and scales, annotated using different schemes. Initially, human domain expert annotation was preferred, as these experts possess the skills necessary to determine correct labels accurately. However, as models have increased in size (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020), the

In Section 5, we show the evaluation results for both correction and detection. In Section 6, we briefly touch on the language models and the effect of our method on the training losses of language models. Finally, we sum up the work with a conclusion in Section 7.2 Related WorkSeveral datasets and models have been developed to address the grammatical error correction task. We review some of those in this section:2.1 DatasetsDatasets that have been utilized for Grammatical Error Correction mostly consist of English academic essays authored by either English learners and native speakers (Yannakoudakis and Briscoe, 2012; Dahlmeier et al., 2013; Napoles et al., 2017; Bryant et al., 2019). Other datasets included web data such as in (Flachs et al., 2020) which contains random paragraphs sampled from the Common-Crawl
[4]: Passage ID 4: that LLMs, particularly when highly confident, can effectively detect these errors, outperforming crowd workers in accuracy, consistency, and cost-efficiency. As LLM capabilities advance, their role in refining data quality will become central to improving NLP benchmarks. Future work could explore applying LLM-based error detection to a broader range of datasets and tasks, as well as refining methods for optimizing label correction strategies. We encourage researchers to adopt our methods and critically evaluate existing datasets to drive more robust, reliable results in the field.AcknowledgementsThis research is a collaboration between the Technion and Google Research, supported by the Google Cloud Research Credits program with the award GCP19980904.Ethics StatementWe address several ethical considerations related to human annotators and the research community.First, we recognize the significant human effort and cost involved in creating the datasets used in this study.
[5]: Passage ID 5: facilitating various downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b). However, they usually assume training and test corpora are clean and it is unclear how the models behave when confronted with noisy input. Grammatical error is an important type of noise since it naturally and frequently occurs in natural language, especially in spoken and written materials from non-native speakers. Dealing with such a noise reflects model robustness in representing language and grammatical knowledge. It would also have a positive social impact if language encoders can model texts from non-native speakers appropriately.Recent work on evaluating model’s behaviors against grammatical errors employs various methods, including (1) manually constructing minimal edited pairs on specific linguistic phenomena (Marvin and Linzen, 2018; Goldberg, 2019; Warstadt et al., 2019a, b); (2) labeling or creating acceptability judgment resources
