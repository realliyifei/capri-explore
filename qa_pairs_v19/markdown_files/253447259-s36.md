## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Various methods enhance model performance in grammatical error correction (GEC) by augmenting official datasets through a combination of techniques aimed at improving data quality and model robustness. These methods largely focus on addressing the prevalence of grammatical errors in natural language, which are particularly common in inputs from non-native speakers and in informal writing contexts [1][4]. 

One common approach involves the construction of datasets that include noisy inputs to simulate real-world scenarios where users frequently make grammatical errors. By including such examples in training and testing phases, models become more adept at handling diverse linguistic phenomena. For instance, researchers have employed strategies such as creating minimal edited pairs to underscore specific grammatical issues or utilizing labeling with acceptability judgments to generate more nuanced training data [4]. These methods are effective because they allow models to learn directly from examples that mirror the types of errors encountered in everyday language use.

Furthermore, leveraging large language models (LLMs) has shown promising results in improving GEC tasks. Recent advancements indicate that LLMs, particularly when they exhibit high confidence, can significantly outperform traditional crowd workers in tasks related to error detection due to their enhanced capacity for consistency and cost-efficiency. This shift suggests that as LLMs evolve, their capacity to refine data quality will play a crucial role in advancing NLP benchmarks and, by extension, the performance of GEC systems [3]. 

Another effective tactic is the application of data-driven methodologies for cleaning and curating datasets used in GEC systems. For instance, by implementing clean insertions to rectify errors in existing readings, researchers can create parallel datasets that better reflect the target language's grammar and syntax [1]. This process not only leads to better-trained models but also addresses the inherent noise present in organic data gathering processes.

Moreover, collaborative approaches that combine labeled datasets from multiple sources can yield more comprehensive training sets. By integrating datasets from various domains and languages, models develop a more robust generalization capability, allowing them to address a wider array of grammatical errors efficiently.

In conclusion, the improvement of model performance in grammatical error correction through dataset augmentation hinges on several strategies: constructing noise-infused datasets, leveraging the advanced capabilities of LLMs, implementing data-cleaning processes, and utilizing collaborative or multi-source dataset approaches. Together, these methods contribute to more reliable and effective GEC systems that can handle the imperfections found in real-world data, significantly enhancing the overall efficacy of natural language processing applications [1][2][3][4].

We achieve state-of-the-art results on two Turkish Grammatical Error Correction test sets out of the three publicly available ones. We also show the effectiveness of our method on the training losses of training language models.1 IntroductionHumans naturally tend to make typos for various factors. Those typos and grammatical errors propagate to the data used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and any data-related tasks, which could lead to unexpected behavior. For instance, a sentiment analysis text classifier that has been trained with a frequently occurring misspelled word may produce unexpected results when processing correctly spelled words in the input. Another example that we looked into closely is Large Language Models (LLMs) which are trained on massive amounts of data mostly

In Section 5, we show the evaluation results for both correction and detection. In Section 6, we briefly touch on the language models and the effect of our method on the training losses of language models. Finally, we sum up the work with a conclusion in Section 7.2 Related WorkSeveral datasets and models have been developed to address the grammatical error correction task. We review some of those in this section:2.1 DatasetsDatasets that have been utilized for Grammatical Error Correction mostly consist of English academic essays authored by either English learners and native speakers (Yannakoudakis and Briscoe, 2012; Dahlmeier et al., 2013; Napoles et al., 2017; Bryant et al., 2019). Other datasets included web data such as in (Flachs et al., 2020) which contains random paragraphs sampled from the Common-Crawl

As LLM capabilities advance, their role in refining data quality will become central to improving NLP benchmarks. Future work could explore applying LLM-based error detection to a broader range of datasets and tasks, as well as refining methods for optimizing label correction strategies. We encourage researchers to adopt our methods and critically evaluate existing datasets to drive more robust, reliable results in the field.AcknowledgementsThis research is a collaboration between the Technion and Google Research, supported by the Google Cloud Research Credits program with the award GCP19980904.Ethics StatementWe address several ethical considerations related to human annotators and the research community.First, we recognize the significant human effort and cost involved in creating the datasets used in this study.
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: facilitating various downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b). However, they usually assume training and test corpora are clean and it is unclear how the models behave when confronted with noisy input. Grammatical error is an important type of noise since it naturally and frequently occurs in natural language, especially in spoken and written materials from non-native speakers. Dealing with such a noise reflects model robustness in representing language and grammatical knowledge. It would also have a positive social impact if language encoders can model texts from non-native speakers appropriately.Recent work on evaluating model’s behaviors against grammatical errors employs various methods, including (1) manually constructing minimal edited pairs on specific linguistic phenomena (Marvin and Linzen, 2018; Goldberg, 2019; Warstadt et al., 2019a, b); (2) labeling or creating acceptability judgment resources
