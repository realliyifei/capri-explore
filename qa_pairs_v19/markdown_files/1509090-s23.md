## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain information about how rule-based methods specifically address the challenges of variability, discontiguity, and ambiguity in processing multiword expressions (MWEs). The passages primarily focus on the challenges posed by MWEs and the performance of neural models in detecting them, but there is no mention of rule-based approaches or their strategies related to the specified challenges. As a result, the information is insufficient to answer your question adequately.

Each Subtask includes different settings regarding the amount of training data. Besides the task description, this paper introduces the datasets in English, Portuguese, and Galician and their annotation procedure, the evaluation metrics, and a summary of the participant systems and their results. The task had close to 100 registered participants organised into twenty five teams making over 650 and 150 submissions in the practice and evaluation phases respectively.1 IntroductionMultiword Expressions (MWEs) are a challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as their linguistic behaviour (e.g., syntactic, semantic) differs from that of generic word combinations Baldwin and Kim (2010); Ramisch and Villavicencio (2018). Moreover, MWEs are pervasive in all domains Biber

The task of processing MWEs is crucial in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, including machine translation and terminology extraction. Therefore, detecting MWEs is a popular research theme. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art neural transformers in the task of detecting MWEs.

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: consisting of the novel MWE dataset and the two associated tasks in Section 3. We discuss our experiments and results for these two tasks in Section 4, before presenting a discussion of the more interesting elements of our findings in Section 5. We present our conclusions and possible avenues of future work in Section 6.2 Related workThe problems posed by MWEs to NLP models have been known for some time Sag et al. (2002); Constant et al. (2017); Shwartz and Dagan (2019). For instance, Sag et al. (2002) refer to the idiomaticity problem and place the need for effective processing of MWEs on par with that for word sense disambiguation to be able to effectively process text. While their analysis focused on symbolicmethods, this problem still persists:Shwartz and Dagan (2019) showed, using six tasks, that contextual pre-trained language models, capable of handling polysemy, continued to be unable to effectively handle idiomatic MWEs, although they tend to do better than their
