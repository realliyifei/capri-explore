## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not include specific details about rule-based methods or how they handle the challenges of variability, discontiguity, and ambiguity in processing multiword expressions (MWEs). While the context discusses the nature of MWEs, their complexities, and the performance of certain systems in identifying them, it does not elaborate on the strategies employed by rule-based methods in tackling these issues. As such, it is insufficient to provide a comprehensive answer to the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: and grammar [Green et al., 2011, Constant et al., 2017].?) have reported a notable amount of parsing failures caused by missing MWEs. Simply listing all the potential non-compositional MWEs is not enough due to their complex characteristics including discontinuity, heterogeneity, syntactic variability and most importantly their ambiguity [Constant et al., 2017].MWEs pose greater challenges when processing running texts which has recently attracted more attention [Qu et al., 2015, Schneider et al., 2016].The Parseme shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) edition 1.1 [Ramisch et al., 2018] aims at studying automatic labelling of VMWEs in their contexts. We propose a system that can model the VMWE-annotated training data and predict MWEhood labels for blind test data.Previous edition of VMWE shared task [Savary et al., 2017] features successful systems such as the transition-based [Al Saied et al., 2017] and the CRF-based systems [Maldonado
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: system participated in the open track of the Parseme shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs due to the use of pre-trained wikipedia word embeddings. It outperformed all participating systems in both open and closed tracks with the overall macro-average MWE-based F1 score of 58.09 averaged among all languages.A particular strength of the system is its superior performance on unseen data entries.1 IntroductionMultiword Expressions (MWEs) are linguisticunits consisting of more than one word that arestructurally and semantically idiosyncratic. Asthey cross word boundaries [Sag et al., 2002] and demonstrate multifaceted properties [Tsvetkov andWintner, 2014], MWEs don’t fit well in thetraditional grammar descriptions where there is a distinct line between lexicon and grammar [Green et al., 2011, Constant et al., 2017].?) have reported a notable amount of parsing failures caused by missing MWEs. Simply listing all the potential non-compositional MWEs is not

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: system is on cases with bigger gaps and this can explain the low results for English. In general, the system seems to perform inefficiently for discontinuous expressions. For instance, the following LVCs have not been identified using the system.•EN: gave him a vicious stare•FR: la conduite des travaux est menée7 ConclusionsIn this paper we proposed a neural model for MWE identification consisting of ConvNet and LSTM layers and an optional CRF layer. We compared the results of the models with strong baselines and the state-of-the-art. Overall, We conclude that a simple addition of a CRF layer toa well-performing ConvNet+LSTM network does not necessarily improve the results. The ConvNet+LSTM model benefiting from pre-trained embeddings achieved the best performance across multilingual datasets of the Parseme shared task on identification of verbal MWEs. The system performs best in recognising un-seen MWEs which is noteworthy.References[Al Saied et al., 2017]
