## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not contain information regarding specific strategies for managing noise in distantly supervised NLP tasks. The passages discuss various aspects of NLP, such as dataset creation, model training, and evaluation strategies, but they do not address the particular issue of noise management in the context of distantly supervised tasks. Without specific references to approaches or methodologies dealing with noise, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: have received. To train a model to perform a certain task well, the last step a practitioner must go through is to use available downloadable task-specific corpora, or build one’s own task-specific corpus. This last training step is usually supervised. It is also recommended that if several tasks are to be performed, multi-task training be used wherever possible.V ConclusionsEarly applications of natural language processing included a well-acclaimed but simpleminded algebra word problem solver program called STUDENT [272], as well as interesting but severely constrained conversational systems such as Eliza, which acted as a “psycho-therapist” [273]), and another that conversed about manipulating blocks in a microworld [274]. Nowadays, highly advanced applications of NLP are ubiquitous. These include Google’s and Microsoft’s machine translators, which translate more or less competently from a language to scores of other languages, as well as a number of devices which process
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: QA task; NER 180. [180]:  Named Entity Recognition.IX ConclusionDeep learning offers a way to harness large amount of computation and data with little engineering by hand [90]. With distributed representation, various deep models have become the new state-of-the-art methods for NLP problems. Supervised learning is the most popular practice in recent deep learning research for NLP. In many real-world scenarios, however, we have unlabeled data which require advanced unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches. In cases where there is lack of labeled data for some particular classes or the appearance of a new class while testing the model, strategies like zero-shot learning should be employed. These learning schemes are still in their developing phase but we expect deep learning based NLP research to be driven in the direction of making better use of unlabeled data. We expect such trend to continue with more and better model designs. We expect to see more NLP applications that employ

Our review answers the following review questions:1.Which model-agnostic AL strategies have been applied to ER?2.How did the researchers evaluate their strategies?(a)Which datasets did they use?(b)Which metrics did they use to compare AL strategies?(c)How much time do the AL strategies need for initialization, proposing new data points to annotators, and model retraining (in case of exploitation) depending on the hardware?We chose the ER task due to its complexity in the annotation process [17] and AL [72]. The complexity results from the ER model, which makes decisions for every token (e.g., word). Many AL strategies (>> 80) compute the relevance of a data point based on these individual decisions.For our review, we selected the format of a scoping review [25, 61] because we give an overview of the domain by
