## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided contains information primarily focused on the definitions and scopes of natural language processing (NLP), including its branches, specific applications like question answering (QA), and some procedural aspects of model training, but it does not address the primary strategies for managing noise in distantly supervised NLP tasks. There is no mention of noise management or specific strategies to tackle it in the given passages, making the context insufficient to answer the question accurately.

Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the

To train a model to perform a certain task well, the last step a practitioner must go through is to use available downloadable task-specific corpora, or build one’s own task-specific corpus. This last training step is usually supervised. It is also recommended that if several tasks are to be performed, multi-task training be used wherever possible.V ConclusionsEarly applications of natural language processing included a well-acclaimed but simpleminded algebra word problem solver program called STUDENT [272], as well as interesting but severely constrained conversational systems such as Eliza, which acted as a “psycho-therapist” [273]), and another that conversed about manipulating blocks in a microworld [274]. Nowadays, highly advanced applications of NLP are ubiquitous. These include Google’s and Microsoft’s machine translators, which translate more or less competently from a language to scores of other languages, as well as a number of devices which process
