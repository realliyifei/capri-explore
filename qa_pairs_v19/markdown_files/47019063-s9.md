## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

Diachronic word embeddings tackle temporal analogies by transforming and aligning word representations from different time periods, enabling the study of how meanings and relations between words change over time. This process is instrumental in extending traditional word analogy tasks into the temporal domain, framing what is referred to as the temporal word analogy problem [1].

The core methodology involves training embedding models on distinct time periods and aligning these models using linear transformations. By doing so, researchers can establish a comparable framework across different eras. For instance, one can express temporal analogies in the form ‚Äòword w1 at time period tŒ± is like word w2 at time period tŒ≤‚Äô [1]. This alignment allows for the identification of which word vector in the later time period (tŒ≤) is closest to the vector of w1 from the earlier time period (tŒ±). As a result, the system can solve temporal analogies by finding these proximity relations between vectors through distance measures in the embedding space.

Moreover, scholars have examined the relatedness of words over time, facilitating queries such as determining ‚Äòin which time period were the words Obama and president maximally related‚Äô [1]. This aspect of diachronic embeddings highlights their versatility in answering specific queries about semantic changes and relationships. The study of temporal relationships significantly benefits from this approach, as it can reveal shifts in significance or meaning of terms across timeframes.

The field of diachronic embeddings is diverse, involving various research communities like natural language processing, information retrieval, and political science. This heterogeneity contributes to a rich body of terminology but also reflects the challenges practitioners face due to the lack of standardized definitions [2]. Scholars involved in these studies aim to trace semantic shifts and account for the implications of their findings, focusing on how societal changes influence language [3].

Historically, diachronic word embeddings have utilized methodologies like word2vec with skip-gram models, employing alignment techniques such as orthogonal Procrustes for effective transformation of vectors across time spans. These methodologies underscore the processes of semantic shift, illuminating how the representation of concepts evolves, and calling attention to ethical considerations in interpreting these results [5]. By analyzing changes over long periods, studies can reveal insights into societal transformations and the evolution of lexical meanings, thus enriching our understanding of language dynamics [3][5]. 

In summary, diachronic word embeddings address temporal analogies through systematic word vector alignments and transformations, enabling researchers to explore and quantify semantic shifts and relationships throughout history.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: retrieval from document collections with significant time spans. ?) frames this as the temporal word analogy problem, extending the word analogies concept into the temporal dimension. This work shows that diachronic word embeddings can successfully model relations like ‚Äòword w1subscriptùë§1w_{1} at time period tŒ±subscriptùë°ùõºt_{\alpha} is like word w2subscriptùë§2w_{2} at time period tŒ≤subscriptùë°ùõΩt_{\beta}‚Äô. To this end, embedding models trained on different time periods are aligned using linear transformations. Then, the temporal analogies are solved by simply finding out which word vector in the time period tŒ≤subscriptùë°ùõΩt_{\beta} is the closest to the vector of w1subscriptùë§1w_{1} in the time period tŒ±subscriptùë°ùõºt_{\alpha}.A variation of this task was studied in ?), where the authors learn the relatedness of words over time,answering queries like ‚Äòin which time period were the words Obama and president maximally related‚Äô. This technique can be used for a more efficient user query

There are at least three different research communities interested in it: natural language processing (and computational linguistics), information retrieval (and computer science in general), and political science. This is reflected in the terminology, which is far from being standardized. One can find mentions of ‚Äòtemporal embeddings,‚Äô ‚Äòdiachronic embeddings,‚Äô ‚Äòdynamic embeddings,‚Äô etc., depending on the background of a particular research group.The present survey paper attempts to describe this diversity, introduce some axes of comparison and outline main challenges which the practitioners face. Figure¬†1 shows the timeline of events that influenced the research in this area: in the following sections we cover them in detail.This survey is restricted in scope to research which traces semantic shifts using distributional word embedding models (that is, representing lexical meaning with dense vectors produced

This approach can complement the more common semasiological approaches, and give a better image of society from our current knowledge. For example, we found that in the 1800s, cart had the most similar embedding to the modern embedding of truck.The article structure is as follows: In the ‚ÄúDefinitions and Previous Work‚Äù section, we explain key terms and touch on previous research.

The most common way to study semantic shift is through a semasiological perspective (Tahmasebi et¬†al., 2019): what is studied is how the meaning of a word changes through time. In this paper, we will take a less common route, known as onomasiological perspective: we will study how the same concept is represented by different words across time.In this study, we will use diachronic word embeddings trained with English from 1800 to 2000 to find interesting shifts in the representation of the same concept through time.
