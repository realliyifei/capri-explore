Re-ranking enhances grammatical error correction (GEC) by integrating additional features and candidate selection methods that improve the accuracy and fluency of the suggested corrections. This approach can be elucidated through several studies and advancements in the field.

Firstly, the combination of neural machine translation (NMT) and grammatical error correction demonstrates significant improvements in error detection and correction. For instance, Yannakoudakis et al. (2017) described a neural sequence-labeling model that calculates the probabilities of each token in a sentence being correct or incorrect, allowing the model to use these error-detecting results as features for re-ranking the top N candidate hypotheses generated during the correction process [5]. By evaluating candidates based on their grammaticality using probabilistic predictions, the final output can be more precisely tailored to correct specific errors.

Moreover, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been shown to significantly outpace traditional recurrent neural networks like long short-term memory (LSTM) networks when it comes to capturing local context through attention mechanisms [1] [2] [3]. This capacity enhances the coverage of grammatical errors, allowing the model to produce higher-quality corrections. By ensembling multiple models and incorporating N-gram language models and edit features through rescoring, a novel GEC method has been developed that surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in both grammaticality and fluency [1] [2].

The integration of N-best lists also plays a crucial role in enhancing error correction systems. Research has explored how leveraging N-best hypotheses may provide richer contextual information compared to single-best hypotheses. For example, Guo et al. (n.d.) used an 8-best list for rescoring candidates with an LSTM language model, while other studies have employed methods like concatenating N-best hypotheses into a bidirectional encoder [4]. By utilizing these extended inputs, GEC models have access to a broader set of candidate corrections, which allows for better selection based on additional grammatical features and contextual coherence.

In conclusion, re-ranking mechanisms in grammatical error correction systems leverage additional features—like error probabilities from NMT models, local context capture from CNNs, and a wider array of candidate selections from N-best lists—to culminate in more nuanced and accurate error corrections. This multifaceted approach results in GEC systems that not only improve in terms of accuracy but also enhance the fluency and overall quality of the generated text corrections.

[4]: Passage ID 4: research has also explored various methods to improve ASR error correction by leveraging N-best lists, which offer richer information compared to single 1-best hypotheses. For instance, Guo et al. [18] generates an 8-best list with the ASR model and rescored candidates with an LSTM language model [30]. Zhu et al.  [31] concatenated N-best hypotheses for input to a bidirectional encoder, and Leng et al.[32] investigated non-autoregressive models with similar approaches. More recent work by Ma et al.[25] and Chen et al.[27] has integrated N-best lists with generative LLMs to enhance error correction performance.Building on these advances, our paper introduces a novel approach that uses LLMs to improve ASR error correction. We compare fine-tuning versus zero-shot error correction methods and investigate how ASR N-best lists can be effectively utilized. A major contribution of our work is the innovative use of ASR N-best lists as extended inputs, which provides richer context and more
