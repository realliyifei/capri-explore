## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

I don’t know. The context provided does not contain specific information regarding the limitations of current NLP systems in handling African-American English (AAE) or any proposed strategies by the authors to overcome these limitations. The references primarily discuss broad challenges associated with low-resource languages in Africa, evaluation of NLP tasks, and the importance of specialized datasets but do not mention AAE or strategies specifically tailored to that dialect. Hence, the context lacks sufficient details to address the question comprehensively.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: believe that our corrections enhance the linguistic accuracy and reliability of the data and, thereby, contributing to more effective evaluation of NLP tasks involving the four African languages.1 IntroductionLow-resource languages, especially from Africa, are greatly under-represented in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) landscape, and this is primarily due to the absence of sufficient resources for both training and evaluation Adelani et al. (2022); Kreutzer et al. (2022). Various efforts are been made to create such resources and these include initiatives by organizations such as Lacuna111https://lacunafund.org/ that fund new and qualitative open datasets, community-driven approaches such as Masakhane222https://www.masakhane.io/, HausaNLP333https://hausanlp.github.io/ and the University of Pretoria’s Data Science for Social Impact (DSFSI) Research Group444https://dsfsi.github.io/, and other individual initiatives Abdulmumin et al.

[2]:  Passage ID 2: Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with text understanding and text generation. The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: general NLP models in domain-specific tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction, and others [56, 76]. This demonstrated the importance of specialized data and triggered a trend in fine-tuning models on annotated, domain-specific datasets.A more recent study [77] showed that training BERT [16] on the British National Corpus [12] (i.e., a carefully curated yet much smaller text collection than that used to train the original model) achieved even better performance than the original BERT model.Thus, even in the age of powerful neural models, the quality and specificity of data remain critical factors in achieving high-performance NLP systems. Moreover, without datasets for training and validation, the field of Kyrgyz NLP simply cannot advance.2.2 Processing Methods for Less-Resourced LanguagesAddressing the challenges faced by LRLs requires innovative approaches that compensate for the lack of resources. Several common methods have been employed to process LRLs
