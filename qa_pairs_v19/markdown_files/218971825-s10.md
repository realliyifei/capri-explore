## Answer

I don't know. The context provided does not mention any specific strategies proposed by the authors to overcome the limitations of current NLP systems in handling African-American English (AAE). The passages primarily discuss general aspects of natural language processing (NLP), such as its focus on question answering (QA), challenges in computational understanding of text, issues of fairness in NLP systems, and the lack of resources for minority languages [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. However, no concrete strategies or recommendations related explicitly to AAE are mentioned in any of the provided excerpts.

[1]: Passage ID 1: Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with text understanding and text generation. The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their

[3]: Passage ID 3: processing approaches such as large language models, AI-based chatbots or healthcare applications is an important issue, that is still unresolved.In this paper, we have conducted and analyzed 14 semi-structured expert interviews with mostly NLP experts in the industry and two algorithmic fairness experts in academia. Our interviewees helped us identify six main criteria and 18 criteria on the second hierarchy level of an open coding scheme for certifying the fairness of an NLP approach.Those criteria are an important building block towards operationalizing and testing NLP processes to certify fairness, from the perspective of the auditor as well as from the perspective of the audited organization.Our interviewees have raised plenty of open questions for future research. For instance: How should a certification process handle the use case dependence of fairness or its non-binary nature and subjectiveness while in a dynamic environment? To what extent would it make sense to make
[4]: Passage ID 4: explain the state-of-the-art. Our research is a valuable guide and reference for artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners interested in natural language processing applications such as recommender systems, chatbots, and sentiment analysis.Index Terms: Artificial neural networks, genealogy, natural language processing, survey, taxonomy, text representation\titlepgskip=-15ptI IntroductionComputational understanding of natural language is referred to as a particularly hard problem of science [1] and sometimes it is even described as being “simply too hard” [2]. Nonetheless, the research field of natural language processing (NLP) takes on this challenge to enable machines to fully understand human text and speech [3]. The principal obstacle for a machine in NLP is the symbolic nature of text. Although a machine can process it, the meaning of language goes beyond what is represented [4]. To access the underlying information, traditional approaches compile texts
[5]: Passage ID 5: as work to date has primarily focused on English or other high-resource languages Mondal et al. (2022) but devoted less efforts towards minority languages. Additionally, the lack of human evaluation of NLP-based health systems has made it challenging to measure their effectiveness in the real world. Current automatic evaluation metrics do not necessarily speak to patient outcomes. Hence, human-centric studies must be conducted in evaluating the efficacy of NLP-powered tools in healthcare.Research Directions.1.Healthcare benchmark construction. Although the documentation of recent LLMs reports very high performance for various medical question answering benchmarks, or medical licensing texts, there are many other tasks in healthcare that lack the data required to achieve similarly good performance. Access to medical datasets is often limited because of privacy issues, and therefore other approaches may be required to compile such benchmarks. Synthetic datasets are one such
