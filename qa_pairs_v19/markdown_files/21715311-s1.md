## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The expansion approach is often preferred for constructing WordNets because it allows for the localization or translation of existing synsets from a foundational resource, specifically the English Princeton WordNet (PWN). This model supports the creation of synsets in other languages by using pre-existing synsets as templates, ensuring a level of semantic consistency across languages. For instance, the Polish WordNet was successfully constructed using this model [2] [5]. 

The core reason for the preference of this approach lies in its ability to facilitate the integration of existing lexical resources into new languages while addressing issues related to translation gaps and specificity. It allows for the adaptation of a well-established framework (like PWN) to accommodate nuances in different languages, thus enhancing the quality of the resulting language resource. The use of the expand model also helps in identifying untranslatable concepts, as exemplified by the expansion of the Arabic WordNet, which incorporated 236 lexical gaps and 701 phrasets to effectively address language diversity and untranslatability issues [1].

Moreover, while constructing synsets automatically, the expansion approach relies on a combination of expert validation and pre-existing models, leading to a more accurate eventual mapping of concepts [1] [5]. The Arabic WordNet (AWN V3), for example, not only included a substantial number of synsets (9,576 synsets) but also incorporated feedback from language experts to ensure the quality and validity of the translations and expansions made [1]. This blending of automated processes with human expertise helps mitigate common issues found in other construction methods, such as the potential pitfalls of relying solely on automated or semi-automated techniques that often lead to quality degradation [5].

Through these mechanisms, the expansion model simplifies the synset construction process by leveraging proven, authoritative resources and linguistic expertise. This method is crucial in addressing both completeness and correctness in semantic networks, as it limits the dependency on primary data that may not incorporate linguistic intricacies effectively. By utilizing a validated base such as PWN and adapting it for specific languages through expert collaboration, the expansion approach significantly enhances the efficiency and reliability of constructing WordNets. Thus, combining expert insights with pre-existing frameworks leads to richer and more useful lexical resources across different languages. 

In summary, the expansion approach is favored due to its capacity to align with established semantic networks, incorporate expert validation, and address language-specific challenges effectively, leading to high-quality synset construction.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: For example, in Freihat et al. (2024), we adopted a language expert-based methodology involving two translators and an Arabic language expert to improve the quality of the Arabic wordnet. This approach addressed multiple aspects of lexico-semantic resource quality (Khalilia et al., 2021) by adding missing information and correcting errors, with a focus on handling language diversity and untranslatability. Specifically, we expanded the structure of the wordnet to include phrasets, which provide approximate phrase-level translations, and lexical gaps, representing untranslatable concepts.Our methodology was validated on the Arabic wordnet, resulting in AWN V3, which includes 9,576 synsets, 236 gaps, and 701 phrasets.Similarly, Bella et al. (2020) applied the expert-sourced expansion methodology in the development of the Scottish Gaelic wordnet. A total of 10,583 English synsets from the Princeton WordNet were translated and validated by Gaelic language experts, and then merged with
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: such as machine translation Poibeau (2017), information retrieval Nie (2022), or word sense disambiguation Navigli (2009).The English Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Miller, 1995), as the first wordnet, has been adapted and employed as a foundation for constructing wordnets in other languages.In general, WordNets are constructed using either the merge or the expand model Vossen (1998). In the merge model, synsets are initially created from pre-existing resources (e.g., dictionaries) in a language. Then, for translability into other languages, the synsets have to be aligned with equivalent English synsets in PWN. For example, the IndoWordNet (Bhattacharyya, 2010) was built following this model. In the expand model, PWN synsets are ‘localized’ or ‘translated’ into target languages. For example, the Polish WordNet (Piasecki et al., 2009) was constructed using this model. In either case, when mapping across languages, the PWN synsets (and thus the English language) are usually used as a
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: et al. (2006) proposed a taxonomy induction method to expand WordNet 2.1 concepts by automatic noun hyponym acquisition, achieving 10,000 novel synsets with 84% precision. Compared to previous methods that relied on individual classifiers to uncover new relationships based on pre-designed or automatically extracted textual patterns, the proposed approach considers input from multiple classifiers to enhance the overall structure of the taxonomy and prioritizes the optimization of the entire taxonomy structure with a probabilistic architecture. Snow et al. (2006) also proposed an (m,n)-cousin classification-based model to learn coordinate terms, which allows it to integrate heterogeneous evidence from different classifiers and choose the correct word sense to which to attach a new hypernym. The evaluation of the inferred taxonomies produced by the algorithm was conducted by directly comparing them with the WordNet 2.1 taxonomy. This was achieved by testing each taxonomy using a set of

[4]:  Passage ID 4: 2017).Their ablation study also shows the importance of additional attention to the title.5.7.2 Structured Concept ExtractionCompared with keyphrase extraction-liked concept extraction, structured concept extraction aimed to develop an ontology where concepts are connected with each other by certain relationships. Here, we introduce three knowledge bases resulting from concept extraction: WordNet, ConceptNet, and SenticNet. Out of them, WordNet focuses more on a word-level ontology, ConceptNet focuses more on a concept-level ontology (e.g., also including phrases for concepts), and SenticNet is a concept-level ontology focusing on contributing to sentiment analysis tasks.WordNet is a manually developed knowledge base, where words and concepts are hierarchically organized. Snow et al. (2006) proposed a taxonomy induction method to expand WordNet 2.1 concepts by automatic noun hyponym acquisition, achieving 10,000 novel synsets with 84% precision. Compared to previous methods
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: the Polish WordNet (Piasecki et al., 2009) was constructed using this model. In either case, when mapping across languages, the PWN synsets (and thus the English language) are usually used as a pivot when translating words across languages.Wordnets often suffer from quality issues, in a large part due to the use of automated and semi-automated methods for building them Khalilia et al. (2021a, b). In addition, mistakes can be hard to detect as most wordnets do not contain glosses or example sentences. The above are true of the existing Arabic wordnets. The first Arabic wordnet (AWN V1) was built following the expand model (Elkateb et al., 2006) and includes 9,618 synsets translated from PWN to modern standard Arabic. Its second version (AWN V2) (Regragui et al., 2016) extended AWN V1 to 11,269 synsets and was developed using a semi-automatic method and the expand model. As we show in our paper, both wordnets suffer from correctness and completeness issues, and lack glosses and
