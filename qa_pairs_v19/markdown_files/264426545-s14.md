## I don't know?: False

Data augmentation strategies that are employed to address challenges in automatic pronunciation assessment include a variety of techniques aimed at enhancing the training data without requiring the collection of new spoken samples. These approaches are summarized as follows:

1. **Altering Canonical Text**: One effective method involves modifying the canonical text by introducing mismatched phoneme pairs. This strategy preserves the original word-level speech while allowing for the assessment of pronunciation errors. The intent is to simulate potential pronunciation variations learners might produce, thus enriching the training dataset without collecting new audio samples [2] [3] [4] [5].

2. **Mixup Technique in Feature Space**: Another strategy utilized is the mixup technique, which operates within the feature space. This involves leveraging phone-level Gaussian Mixture Model Posterior probabilities (GOP) to construct new word-level training data. This approach effectively blends existing samples to create new instances, thus expanding the diversity of the phonetic representations in the training set [2] [3] [4] [5].

3. **Using SSL Model Embeddings**: The error distance of clustered Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model embeddings is employed to substitute phoneme sounds with similar sounding phonemes. This method capitalizes on the existing information from previously clustered phonemes to generate variations that can help improve the robustness of the pronunciation assessment models [2] [3] [4] [5].

4. **Voice Transformations**: Voice transformation techniques can also be applied. These techniques modify the pitch, vocal-tract, and vocal-source characteristics to create new speech samples that still retain phonetic accuracy. Such transformations can significantly increase the variety of speech inputs available for training models, addressing the challenge of limited data, especially in low-resource scenarios [2] [3] [4] [5].

5. **Synthesis of Phoneme Sequences**: Furthermore, models like L2-GEN can be utilized to synthesize realistic second language (L2) phoneme sequences. This involves building a Seq2Seq phoneme paraphrasing model that can generate novel phoneme strings effectively, thus adding further variation and richness to the training data used for pronunciation assessment tasks [2] [3] [4] [5].

Collectively, these data augmentation strategies not only enhance the volume and variability of the training data available for pronunciation assessment but also lead to significant improvements in the robustness and accuracy of automated speech recognition systems, particularly when working with low-resource languages or dialects. By leveraging existing data creatively, practitioners in the field can optimize model performance without the often prohibitive costs associated with collecting new annotated speech samples.

[1]: Passage ID 1: In this paper, we consider data augmentation techniques for improving speech recognition for low-resource languages, focusing on Maltese as a test case. We consider three different types of data augmentation: unsupervised training, multilingual training and the use of synthesized speech as training data. The goal is to determine which of these techniques, or combination of them, is the most effective to improve speech recognition for languages where the starting point is a small corpus of approximately 7 hours of transcribed speech. Our results show that combining the data augmentation techniques studied here lead us to an absolute WER improvement of 151515% without the use of a language model.Index Terms: Data augmentation, speech recognition, multilingual training, noisy transcription.I IntroductionIn recent years, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen heavy interest in large-scale reusable multilingual models [1], relying on large quantities of pre-training data.

Such methods employed strategies like altering the canonical text by introducing mismatched phoneme pairs while preserving the original word-level speech Fu et al. (2021). Additionally, a mixup technique is utilized in the feature space, leveraging phone-level GOP pooling to construct word-level training data Fu et al. (2022). Furthermore, the error distance of the clustered SSL model embeddings are employed to substitute the phoneme sound with a similar sound Zhang et al. (2022b). These latter approaches depend on the reuse of existing information rather than generating novel instances of mispronunciations. In Fernandez et al.
