## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information on how external entity embeddings are integrated into BERT models specifically for entity linking. It primarily discusses the performance of BERT in tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and the benefits of pre-trained models for NLP tasks, but it does not address the integration processes or implications of using external embeddings for entity linking, nor does it provide insights into the strengths and drawbacks of this specific approach.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: from original texts. Thanks to the advent of pre-trained language models such as BERT (Kenton \BBA Toutanova, \APACyear2019) and ELMo (Peters \BOthers., \APACyear2018), the performance of NER is significantly enhanced by the feature extraction capability of pre-trained language models. Kenton \BBA Toutanova (\APACyear2019) solved NER task using BERT for token classification model. Gao \BOthers. (\APACyear2021) proposed a BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model and validated its feature extraction capability on the downstream NER task.2.2 Language ModelsThe acquisition of word embeddings is a crucial step in NLP tasks. Word embeddings mean learning the latent semantic information of words (tokens) from a large amount of unlabeled data, and map the words (tokens) into dense low-dimensional vectors, which is also called the distributed representation of words (Liu \BOthers., \APACyear2020). In the past decade, several word-embedding techniques have been proposed such as Word2Vec (Mikolov,

MacAveney’s system called CEDR (Contextualized Embeddings for Document Ranking) improved performance of all three prior models, and produced state-of-the-art results using BERT’s token representations.IV-B Information ExtractionInformation extraction extracts explicit or implicit information from text. The outputs of systems vary, but often the extracted data and the relationships within it are saved in relational databases [172].Commonly extracted information includes named entities and relations, events and their participants, temporal information, and tuples of facts.IV-B1 Named Entity RecognitionNamed entity recognition (NER) refers to the identification of proper nouns as well as information such as dates, times, prices, and product IDs.The multi-task approach of Collobert et al. [9] included the task, although no results were reported. In their approach, a simple feedforward network was used, having a

In-text data, the context problem is a big challenge to understand the sentence’s meaning through the ML algorithm correctly. This problem solves through pre-trained word embedding and the VADER approach even we have a smaller training dataset. However, the pre-trained word embedding corpus was trained on the google news dataset (100 billion words) and IMDB movie dataset. It shows a good result when the data are related to the pre-trained corpus domain; otherwise, it will not predict the result as expected.The BERT model is the start of the art model in NLP. It uses the bidirectional training of the input, which provides a more profound sense of the language context. However, it is very compute-intensive and takes time to predict the result.

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: designed to facilitate transfer learning, where the model is first trained on a large corpus of data to grasp linguistic patterns and then fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets. This approach has led to significant performance improvements in NLP tasks. BERT’s contextual representations also mark a departure from traditional word embedding methods, offering dynamic word representations based on context.Despite its strengths, there are challenges associated with BERT. The model, particularly its larger variants, is resource-intensive, necessitating substantial computational power for both training and inference. This can be challenging for real-time applications or in scenarios with limited computational resources. Additionally, like many deep learning models, BERT operates as a "black box," where the internal processes leading to an output can be opaque. This lack of interpretability can be a concern in domains where understanding the rationale behind predictions is
