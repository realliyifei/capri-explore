## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Prosodic errors in pronunciation assessment are typically categorized based on several key features that encompass the overall sound production of an entire word or sentence. These features include elements such as stress, rhythm, and intonation. Each of these factors contributes significantly to how intelligibly a speaker can communicate [4]. 

In terms of classification for pronunciation modeling, prosodic approaches focus on detecting variations in lexical stress and tones. This involves utilizing various acoustic features, which may include energy levels, pitch variations, duration, and spectral characteristics. Classifier models, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), are often employed to analyze these features, helping to pinpoint specific prosodic errors related to pronunciation [2]. 

The identification and categorization of prosodic errors may be influenced by factors such as: 

1. **Feature Granularity**: One potential challenge in prosodic assessment is the ideal level of feature granularity used for evaluation. When studies predominantly focus on segmental (phonetic) features—like the goodness of pronunciation (GOP)—there may be discrepancies when assessing suprasegmental features, such as rhythm and stress [3]. This balance is crucial in achieving accurate pronunciation assessment.

2. **Linguistic Background**: The native language of the speaker (L1) can greatly influence prosodic errors. For instance, speakers from different linguistic backgrounds may produce prosodic elements differently or struggle with specific prosodic features that are not present in their native language [5]. This can lead to errors in stress patterns or intonation that might affect overall intelligibility.

3. **Data Availability**: The lack of large-scale labeled speech data for non-native speakers presents another challenge in categorizing prosodic errors. Effective automatic pronunciation assessments rely heavily on the availability of such data to train models appropriately [3]. Without sufficient data, the classification of prosodic errors can be limited and less effective.

4. **Specific Error Types**: Prosodic errors can consist of mispronounced stresses or incorrect intonation patterns that affect how words and sentences are perceived. These errors might not only impact intelligibility but also affect other evaluation components such as comprehensibility or accentedness [1].

In conclusion, prosodic errors in pronunciation assessment are categorized through models that analyze key acoustic features, such as stress and intonation, while being influenced by factors like feature granularity, the speaker's native language, data availability, and specific error types. Understanding these elements can enhance the evaluation process and the effectiveness of pronunciation assessment methodologies.

Given that error in pronunciation is difficult to quantify, it can be split into (a) Objective evaluations – (i): phonetic or segmental; (ii): prosodic or supra-segmental; and (iii) place or articulation, manner of speech or sub-segmental; (b) Subjective evaluations; in many cases measured through listening tasks followed by human judgment, and can be split into three main classes:(i) intelligibility; (ii) comprehensibility and (iii) accentedness (or linguistic native-likeness). See Figure 1 for common pronunciation assessment factors.Figure 1: Types of Pronunciation Errors for AssessmentSeveral studies have summarized advances in pronunciation error detection Eskenazi (1999, 2009); Witt (2012); Li et al. (2016a); Chen and Li (2016); Zhang et al. (2020); Caro Anzola and Mendoza Moreno (2023). Eskenazi (1999) investigated the potentials and limitations of ASR for L2 pronunciation assessment,

[2]:  Passage ID 2: delve into diverse approaches, old, revised, and current methodologies used for pronunciation modeling of both segmental and supra-segmental features, as illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3.4.1 Classification based on Acoustic PhoneticsClassifier-based approaches explored both segmental and prosodic aspects of pronunciation. Segmental approaches involve the use of classifiers targeting specific phoneme pair errors, utilizing different acoustic features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) along with its first and second derivative, energy, zero-cross, and spectral features Van Doremalen et al. (2009); Huang et al. (2020), with different techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Truong et al. (2004); Strik et al. (2009), decision trees Strik et al. (2009). Prosodic approaches focus on detecting lexical stress and tones, utilizing features such as energy, pitch, duration, and spectral characteristics, with classifiers like Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)

On one hand, most of the studies focus exclusively on leveraging segmental (phonetic)-level features such as goodness of pronunciation (GOP); this, however, may cause a discrepancy of feature granularity when performing suprasegmental (prosodic)-level pronunciation assessment. On the other hand, automatic pronunciation assessments still suffer from the lack of large-scale labeled speech data of non-native speakers, which inevitably limits the performance of pronunciation assessment. In this paper, we tackle these problems by integrating multiple prosodic and phonological features to provide a multi-view, multi-granularity, and multi-aspect (3M) pronunciation modeling. Specifically, we augment GOP with prosodic and self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and meanwhile develop a vowel/consonant positional embedding for a more phonology-aware automatic

Additionally, we also explore potential directions for future work.2 Nuances of PronunciationPronunciation can be defined as “the way in which a word or letter is said, or said correctly, or the way in which a language is spoken” .111https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pronunciation, Accessed: 2023-06-21Compared to other language skills, learning pronunciation is difficult. Yet, for learners, mastering L2 pronunciation is most crucial for better communication.Historically, pronunciation errors (mispronunciations) are characterized by phonetic (segmental) errors and prosodic (supra-segmental) errors Witt (2012); Chen and Li (2016), as represented in Figure 1. This characterization provides some clear distinctions for pronunciation assessment.CorpusLanguages (L2)Native Language (L1)Dur/Utt#SpeakersReported SOTA Results /

This can be attributed to several factors, including negative language transfer, incorrect letter-to-sound conversion, and misreading of text prompts Meng et al. (2007b); Qian et al. (2010); Kartushina and Frauenfelder (2014); Li et al. (2016a).For example, Arabic L1 speakers may find it difficult to differentiate between /p/ and /b/ as the phoneme /p/ is non-existent in Arabic, so verbs like /park/ and /bark/ might sound similar to Arabic L1 speakers. Similarly, in Spanish, there are no short vowels, so words like /eat/ and /it/ might sound similar to Spanish L1 speakers.Prosodic ErrorsProsodic features encompass elements that influence the pronunciation of an entire word or sentence, including stress, rhythm, and intonation. Errors related to prosodic features involve the production of larger sound units. For intelligibility, prosodic features particularly play a
