## Answer

## I don't know?: False

Prosodic errors in pronunciation assessment are primarily linked to the larger elements of speech that impact the delivery of words or sentences, such as stress, rhythm, and intonation. These errors can significantly affect intelligibility, as factors influencing prosodic features include the production of larger sound units rather than individual phonemes [1] [4]. 

The categorization of prosodic errors relates to the broader framework of pronunciation error analysis, which divides errors into phonetic (segmental) and prosodic (supra-segmental) categories. In this context, prosodic errors are evaluated based on their effect on the overall understanding of speech, recognizing that clear communication often hinges on these supra-segmental elements [1] [3]. Errors in prosody can include improper stress placement, irregular rhythm, and misplaced intonational patterns, all of which can hinder the listener's ability to comprehend the spoken message accurately.

Factors influencing the categorization of prosodic errors include the complexity of linguistic structures, the speaker's native language, and the acoustic features utilized in assessment. For instance, features like energy, pitch, duration, and spectral characteristics are critical in detecting prosodic errors and can be analyzed using classifiers such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) [2] [4]. Furthermore, the challenges involved in evaluating prosody stem from its reliance on contextual understanding, which complicates the task for many automatic pronunciation assessment models [5]. 

Overall, understanding and assessing prosodic errors requires a multifaceted approach that considers both the linguistic and acoustic dimensions of speech, emphasizing the importance of prosody in achieving effective communication, especially for second language learners. These considerations highlight the need for more advanced systems capable of nuanced evaluation of prosodic features, which is an ongoing challenge in the field of pronunciation assessment [5].

Given that error in pronunciation is difficult to quantify, it can be split into (a) Objective evaluations – (i): phonetic or segmental; (ii): prosodic or supra-segmental; and (iii) place or articulation, manner of speech or sub-segmental; (b) Subjective evaluations; in many cases measured through listening tasks followed by human judgment, and can be split into three main classes:(i) intelligibility; (ii) comprehensibility and (iii) accentedness (or linguistic native-likeness).

Segmental approaches involve the use of classifiers targeting specific phoneme pair errors, utilizing different acoustic features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) along with its first and second derivative, energy, zero-cross, and spectral features Van Doremalen et al. (2009); Huang et al. (2020), with different techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Truong et al. (2004); Strik et al. (2009), decision trees Strik et al. (2009). Prosodic approaches focus on detecting lexical stress and tones, utilizing features such as energy, pitch, duration, and spectral characteristics, with classifiers like Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)

Additionally, we also explore potential directions for future work.2 Nuances of PronunciationPronunciation can be defined as “the way in which a word or letter is said, or said correctly, or the way in which a language is spoken” .111https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pronunciation, Accessed: 2023-06-21Compared to other language skills, learning pronunciation is difficult. Yet, for learners, mastering L2 pronunciation is most crucial for better communication.Historically, pronunciation errors (mispronunciations) are characterized by phonetic (segmental) errors and prosodic (supra-segmental) errors Witt (2012); Chen and Li (2016), as represented in Figure 1.

This can be attributed to several factors, including negative language transfer, incorrect letter-to-sound conversion, and misreading of text prompts Meng et al. (2007b); Qian et al. (2010); Kartushina and Frauenfelder (2014); Li et al. (2016a).For example, Arabic L1 speakers may find it difficult to differentiate between /p/ and /b/ as the phoneme /p/ is non-existent in Arabic, so verbs like /park/ and /bark/ might sound similar to Arabic L1 speakers. Similarly, in Spanish, there are no short vowels, so words like /eat/ and /it/ might sound similar to Spanish L1 speakers.Prosodic ErrorsProsodic features encompass elements that influence the pronunciation of an entire word or sentence, including stress, rhythm, and intonation. Errors related to prosodic features involve the production of larger sound units. For intelligibility, prosodic features particularly play a

Evaluating prosody has always been a challenging task since precise prosody can only be comprehended by grasping the context, which was beyond the capability of previous models [29].
