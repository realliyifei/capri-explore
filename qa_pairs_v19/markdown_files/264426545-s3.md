## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Prosodic errors in pronunciation assessment are primarily categorized based on three interpersonal traits that influence overall intelligibility: stress, rhythm, and intonation. These features are critical because they affect the pronunciation of larger sound units, such as entire words or sentences, rather than just individual phonemes [4]. 

The categorization of prosodic errors can further be influenced by several factors. Firstly, the absence of specific prosodic features in a speaker's native language can lead to difficulties in acquiring those features in a second language (L2). For instance, speakers whose first language lacks certain prosodic elements may struggle with stress and intonation in the target language [5]. Additionally, the methodology used to assess pronunciation, whether segmental (phonetic) or suprasegmental (prosodic), plays a significant role. Many studies have historically focused more on segmental features, which might lead to a misalignment in evaluating prosodic features adequately [3]. This issue stems from a discrepancy in feature granularity, which complicates the assessment of suprasegmental aspects when predominantly segmental features are considered [3].

Another influencing factor is the availability and quality of large-scale labeled speech data specifically from non-native speakers. A lack of such data can hinder the performance of automatic pronunciation assessment systems, making it difficult to accurately capture and evaluate prosodic errors [3]. Furthermore, advancements in technology, such as the integration of multiple prosodic and phonological features in pronunciation assessments, aim to address the limitations of past methodologies. By employing a multi-view and multi-granularity approach in pronunciation modeling, researchers can better understand and categorize prosodic errors [3].

Overall, prosodic errors are categorized through an understanding of the fundamental aspects that influence a learner's pronunciation, incorporating the challenges posed by both the learner's native language and the limitations present in the current methodology for pronunciation assessments. As pronunciation remains a complex aspect of language learning, especially for L2 learners, recognizing these details is crucial for effective evaluation and feedback.

Given that error in pronunciation is difficult to quantify, it can be split into (a) Objective evaluations – (i): phonetic or segmental; (ii): prosodic or supra-segmental; and (iii) place or articulation, manner of speech or sub-segmental; (b) Subjective evaluations; in many cases measured through listening tasks followed by human judgment, and can be split into three main classes:(i) intelligibility; (ii) comprehensibility and (iii) accentedness (or linguistic native-likeness). See Figure 1 for common pronunciation assessment factors.Figure 1: Types of Pronunciation Errors for AssessmentSeveral studies have summarized advances in pronunciation error detection Eskenazi (1999, 2009); Witt (2012); Li et al. (2016a); Chen and Li (2016); Zhang et al. (2020); Caro Anzola and Mendoza Moreno (2023). Eskenazi (1999) investigated the potentials and limitations of ASR for L2 pronunciation assessment,

[2]:  Passage ID 2: delve into diverse approaches, old, revised, and current methodologies used for pronunciation modeling of both segmental and supra-segmental features, as illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3.4.1 Classification based on Acoustic PhoneticsClassifier-based approaches explored both segmental and prosodic aspects of pronunciation. Segmental approaches involve the use of classifiers targeting specific phoneme pair errors, utilizing different acoustic features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) along with its first and second derivative, energy, zero-cross, and spectral features Van Doremalen et al. (2009); Huang et al. (2020), with different techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Truong et al. (2004); Strik et al. (2009), decision trees Strik et al. (2009). Prosodic approaches focus on detecting lexical stress and tones, utilizing features such as energy, pitch, duration, and spectral characteristics, with classifiers like Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)

On one hand, most of the studies focus exclusively on leveraging segmental (phonetic)-level features such as goodness of pronunciation (GOP); this, however, may cause a discrepancy of feature granularity when performing suprasegmental (prosodic)-level pronunciation assessment. On the other hand, automatic pronunciation assessments still suffer from the lack of large-scale labeled speech data of non-native speakers, which inevitably limits the performance of pronunciation assessment. In this paper, we tackle these problems by integrating multiple prosodic and phonological features to provide a multi-view, multi-granularity, and multi-aspect (3M) pronunciation modeling. Specifically, we augment GOP with prosodic and self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and meanwhile develop a vowel/consonant positional embedding for a more phonology-aware automatic

Additionally, we also explore potential directions for future work.2 Nuances of PronunciationPronunciation can be defined as “the way in which a word or letter is said, or said correctly, or the way in which a language is spoken” .111https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pronunciation, Accessed: 2023-06-21Compared to other language skills, learning pronunciation is difficult. Yet, for learners, mastering L2 pronunciation is most crucial for better communication.Historically, pronunciation errors (mispronunciations) are characterized by phonetic (segmental) errors and prosodic (supra-segmental) errors Witt (2012); Chen and Li (2016), as represented in Figure 1. This characterization provides some clear distinctions for pronunciation assessment.CorpusLanguages (L2)Native Language (L1)Dur/Utt#SpeakersReported SOTA Results /

This can be attributed to several factors, including negative language transfer, incorrect letter-to-sound conversion, and misreading of text prompts Meng et al. (2007b); Qian et al. (2010); Kartushina and Frauenfelder (2014); Li et al. (2016a).For example, Arabic L1 speakers may find it difficult to differentiate between /p/ and /b/ as the phoneme /p/ is non-existent in Arabic, so verbs like /park/ and /bark/ might sound similar to Arabic L1 speakers. Similarly, in Spanish, there are no short vowels, so words like /eat/ and /it/ might sound similar to Spanish L1 speakers.Prosodic ErrorsProsodic features encompass elements that influence the pronunciation of an entire word or sentence, including stress, rhythm, and intonation. Errors related to prosodic features involve the production of larger sound units. For intelligibility, prosodic features particularly play a
