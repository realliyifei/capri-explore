## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information about data pre-processing strategies commonly used in the NL2Code domain for ensuring high-quality training corpora for large language models (LLMs). The passages primarily focus on general aspects of NLP, the importance of domain-specific datasets, and pre-training methodologies, but they do not detail particular pre-processing techniques related to the NL2Code domain or any specific strategies used to ensure the quality of training data in that area. Without such specific information, a precise answer cannot be formulated.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: general NLP models in domain-specific tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction, and others [56, 76]. This demonstrated the importance of specialized data and triggered a trend in fine-tuning models on annotated, domain-specific datasets.A more recent study [77] showed that training BERT [16] on the British National Corpus [12] (i.e., a carefully curated yet much smaller text collection than that used to train the original model) achieved even better performance than the original BERT model.Thus, even in the age of powerful neural models, the quality and specificity of data remain critical factors in achieving high-performance NLP systems. Moreover, without datasets for training and validation, the field of Kyrgyz NLP simply cannot advance.2.2 Processing Methods for Less-Resourced LanguagesAddressing the challenges faced by LRLs requires innovative approaches that compensate for the lack of resources. Several common methods have been employed to process LRLs
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: can we create specialized models, and can they really be as good as large general-purpose models in their domain? To answer these questions, we will take a look at different methods of training LLMs, domain-specific datasets and compare the benchmark results of specialized models to general-purpose models in benchmarks related to their domain. This paper will focus on the medical domain for all examples and comparisons.II PretrainingPretraining is the most fundamental step in creating intelligent and capable LLMs. During this training step, the model learns the structure of natural language and tries to memorize as much of the training data as possible. For causal language models, for example, this happens by inputting token sequences into the model and letting it predict the next token in the sequence. The closer the prediction is to the true next token in the sequence, the smaller the loss. The loss is used to adjust the weights of the model, in order to minimize the loss.
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: data.Treviso et al. (2023) surveys efficient NLP methods using a broader definition of efficiency in terms of resources, including data, time, storage, and energy.Hedderich et al. (2021) focus on low-resource, supervised NLP, including distant supervision and pre-training encoder models. In contrast, our work employs a more practical perspective, giving a structured overview of the data-efficient adaptation of pre-trained models in a computationally affordable manner, also considering task-specific aspects.3 Pre-trainingPre-training serves as the initial, foundational training phase for LLMs, enabling them to develop robust general and domain-specific language understanding in a self-supervised manner.This is one of the key success factors for LLMs to cope with a wide range of downstream tasks even with limited labeled data (Radford et al., 2018).The first step is to choose a suitable model architecture (see § 6), which directly entails some options for pre-training

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: A2 Corpus and digital resourcesMost of the current state of the art methods in NLP are data-driven approaches that require vast amounts of corpora in order to achieve good performance. Widely popular machine learning methods and vector space representations, e.g., neural networks and word embeddings, often rely in big monolingual corpora.Annotated and unannotated corpora are required for several NLP tasks. For instance, parallel corpora are essential for building statistical machine translation (MT) systems, while morphological annotated data is essential for POS (Part-of-Speech) taggers and morphological analyzers, just to name a few.In the case of MT, the most common sources for gathering large amounts of parallel data include specific domain texts such as parliamentary proceedings, religious texts, and software manuals that are translated into several languages. Additionally, the World Wide Web represents a good and typical source for finding large-size and balanced
