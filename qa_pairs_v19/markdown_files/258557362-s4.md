## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

In the NL2Code domain, ensuring high-quality training corpora for large language models (LLMs) involves several crucial data pre-processing strategies. The success of these models in code generation significantly relies on the quality and diversity of the datasets used during the pre-training and fine-tuning phases [3]. Here are some common strategies for data pre-processing:

1. **Data Curation and Cleaning**: Prior to any substantial model training, the raw data must be meticulously curated and cleaned. This process ensures that the data is free from errors, duplications, and irrelevant information, which can adversely affect training outcomes. The extensive parameters of LLMs necessitate substantial data to optimize their performance, making rigorous data processing essential [2].

2. **Diverse Data Sourcing**: To maximize the effectiveness of LLMs, it is imperative to curate large-scale corpora from diverse sources. These include webpages, conversational data, technical documents, and various forms of code [2]. This diversity helps the models generalize better across different programming tasks and coding styles.

3. **Structured Data Organization**: Code data is categorized into three distinct classes: pre-training datasets, instruction-tuning datasets, and benchmarks for performance evaluation [5]. This categorization facilitates targeted training strategies, addressing the unique needs at each stage of model development.

4. **Advanced Filtering Algorithms**: The use of sophisticated filtering techniques can enhance dataset quality further. These algorithms help eliminate unqualified or low-quality samples before they are fed into the training process [3].

5. **Automated Mining and Synthesis**: Employing techniques for automated mining of code repositories and synthesizing code data can lead to richer datasets. This may involve querying existing code in repositories to build a more comprehensive dataset that encapsulates various programming constructs and paradigms [3].

6. **Pre-training on Labeled Data**: The practice of leveraging bidirectional and unidirectional pre-trained language models, such as BERT and GPT, involves training on large-scale unlabeled datasets. This foundation allows LLMs to internalize fundamental coding principles and understand code structure dependencies [5].

7. **Collaborations for Data Access**: Collaborating with industry partners, such as GitHub, facilitates access to proprietary codebases. Such partnerships can enhance the model's training material, ensuring it reflects current industry standards and practices [3].

8. **Aggressive Pre-processing Techniques**: When acquiring new data, aggressive pre-processing techniques are employed, which include normalizing code snippets and handling code formatting to make it uniform. These steps ensure that the data fed into the LLM is consistent, improving the efficacy of the training process [2].

In summary, a combination of rigorous data cleaning, diverse sourcing, structured organization, advanced filtering, automated mining, collaborative data access, and aggressive pre-processing techniques serves to establish high-quality training corpora for LLMs in the NL2Code domain. Collectively, these strategies are essential for enabling LLMs to effectively learn and generate high-quality code.

Rule-based methods often involve techniques such as replacing variable names, renaming method names, and inserting dead code to transform code snippets. Some code transformations also consider deeper structural information, such as control-flow graphs (CGFs) and use-define chains (UDGs) Quiring et al. (2019). Model-based Techniques commonly utilize pre-trained models to replace non-keywords in the original data Song et al. (2022). Another approach employed is similar to Back-Translation, where code translation tasks are augmented by translating between two programming languages using natural language as

Data Curation & ProcessingThe exceptional performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be attributed to their training on large-scale and diverse datasets (Zan et al., 2023).Meanwhile, the extensive parameters of these models necessitate substantial data to unlock their full potential, in alignment with established scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022).For a general-purpose LLM, amassing a large-scale corpus of natural language from a variety of sources is imperative. Such sources include webpages, conversation data, books and news, scientific data, and code (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a, b; Yoo et al., 2024), while these data are often crawled from the web and must undergo meticulous and aggressive pre-processing (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: of LLMs largely depends on the quality and diversity of code datasets used during pre-training and fine-tuning phases (Zhou et al., 2024; Köpf et al., 2024; Wettig et al., 2024). Currently, there is a scarcity of large, high-quality datasets that encompass a wide range of programming tasks, styles, and languages. This limitation constrains the ability of LLMs to generalize across unseen programming tasks, different coding environments, and real-world software development scenarios.The development of more sophisticated data acquisition techniques, such as automated code repositories mining (Linstead et al., 2007), advanced filtering algorithms, and code data synthesis (Liu et al., 2024a) (see Section 4.2), can lead to the creation of richer datasets. Collaborations with industry partners (e.g., GitHub) could also facilitate access to proprietary codebases, thereby enhancing the practical relevance of the training material. Furthermore, the adoption of open-source models for dataset

A diagram depicting the standard data preprocessing workflow utilized in the pre-training phase of large language models (LLMs) for code generation.4.1.1. Pre-trainingThe remarkable success of bidirectional pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and unidirectional PLMs like GPT (Radford et al., 2018) has firmly established the practice of pre-training on large-scale unlabeled datasets to endow models with a broad spectrum of general knowledge.Extending this principle to the realm of code generation enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to assimilate fundamental coding principles, including the understanding of code structure dependencies, the semantics of code
