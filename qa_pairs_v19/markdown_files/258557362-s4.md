## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information regarding data pre-processing strategies used to ensure high-quality training corpora for large language models (LLMs) in the NL2Code domain. It discusses general considerations for pre-training and domain-specific model performance but does not specifically mention strategies or techniques for pre-processing data in this particular area of NLP. The context speaks about general efficiency in NLP methods and multi-task training but lacks specific details related to the NL2Code domain or direct pre-processing strategies essential for that application.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: general NLP models in domain-specific tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction, and others [56, 76]. This demonstrated the importance of specialized data and triggered a trend in fine-tuning models on annotated, domain-specific datasets.A more recent study [77] showed that training BERT [16] on the British National Corpus [12] (i.e., a carefully curated yet much smaller text collection than that used to train the original model) achieved even better performance than the original BERT model.Thus, even in the age of powerful neural models, the quality and specificity of data remain critical factors in achieving high-performance NLP systems. Moreover, without datasets for training and validation, the field of Kyrgyz NLP simply cannot advance.2.2 Processing Methods for Less-Resourced LanguagesAddressing the challenges faced by LRLs requires innovative approaches that compensate for the lack of resources. Several common methods have been employed to process LRLs
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: can we create specialized models, and can they really be as good as large general-purpose models in their domain? To answer these questions, we will take a look at different methods of training LLMs, domain-specific datasets and compare the benchmark results of specialized models to general-purpose models in benchmarks related to their domain. This paper will focus on the medical domain for all examples and comparisons.II PretrainingPretraining is the most fundamental step in creating intelligent and capable LLMs. During this training step, the model learns the structure of natural language and tries to memorize as much of the training data as possible. For causal language models, for example, this happens by inputting token sequences into the model and letting it predict the next token in the sequence. The closer the prediction is to the true next token in the sequence, the smaller the loss. The loss is used to adjust the weights of the model, in order to minimize the loss.
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: data.Treviso et al. (2023) surveys efficient NLP methods using a broader definition of efficiency in terms of resources, including data, time, storage, and energy.Hedderich et al. (2021) focus on low-resource, supervised NLP, including distant supervision and pre-training encoder models. In contrast, our work employs a more practical perspective, giving a structured overview of the data-efficient adaptation of pre-trained models in a computationally affordable manner, also considering task-specific aspects.3 Pre-trainingPre-training serves as the initial, foundational training phase for LLMs, enabling them to develop robust general and domain-specific language understanding in a self-supervised manner.This is one of the key success factors for LLMs to cope with a wide range of downstream tasks even with limited labeled data (Radford et al., 2018).The first step is to choose a suitable model architecture (see § 6), which directly entails some options for pre-training

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: have received. To train a model to perform a certain task well, the last step a practitioner must go through is to use available downloadable task-specific corpora, or build one’s own task-specific corpus. This last training step is usually supervised. It is also recommended that if several tasks are to be performed, multi-task training be used wherever possible.V ConclusionsEarly applications of natural language processing included a well-acclaimed but simpleminded algebra word problem solver program called STUDENT [272], as well as interesting but severely constrained conversational systems such as Eliza, which acted as a “psycho-therapist” [273]), and another that conversed about manipulating blocks in a microworld [274]. Nowadays, highly advanced applications of NLP are ubiquitous. These include Google’s and Microsoft’s machine translators, which translate more or less competently from a language to scores of other languages, as well as a number of devices which process
