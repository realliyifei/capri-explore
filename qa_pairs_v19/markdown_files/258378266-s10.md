## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

The challenges of using QA pairs as positive samples in neural ranking models, particularly in the context of technical Q&A forums, arise from several factors related to the inherent complexities of the domain and the nature of the data. 

First, one prominent challenge is the "answer hungry" phenomenon, where a substantial number of questions remain unanswered or unresolved. This implies that only a small proportion of questions can be paired with an "ideal" answer, which is necessary for establishing accurate positive samples. For technical questions, locating qualified annotators who possess the requisite expertise to evaluate the quality of responses is difficult, thereby complicating the creation of a comprehensive dataset of QA pairs labeled as positive [2] [4].

Moreover, due to the specialized nature of technical queries, it is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process to manually label QA pairs. Experts with appropriate knowledge are often scarce, making it hard to assemble a reliable training set. This concern necessitates alternatives for generating training samples, as manual labeling can become impractical [2] [5]. Consequently, the efficacy of the labeling scheme is crucial to ensure that the positive samples genuinely reflect high-quality responses to the questions.

Additionally, even when QA pairs are labeled, challenges persist in distinguishing between similar answers. While positive samples are those correlated with marked "best" answers, distinguishing between neutral and negative samples can be ambiguous. This ambiguity might mislead the model during training, leading to less effective learning outcomes. The introduction of nuanced categories like neutral+ and neutral- aims to address this issue, but can also introduce complexity in the labeling process and subsequent model training [3] [4].

Finally, despite the development of advanced neural networks designed to handle these complexities, the models still face limitations in capturing the contextual nuances of questions and answers fully. The effectiveness of the model may suffer if the training samples do not adequately represent the intricate relationships between varied technical questions and their respective answers, particularly if the lexical gap is not sufficiently addressed [1] [3].

In summary, the challenges in utilizing QA pairs as positive samples in neural ranking models primarily stem from the limited availability of high-quality, expert-validated data, the labor-intensive nature of labeling, the difficulty in distinguishing nuanced answer types, and the potential limitations of the models in capturing the depth of technical dialogue. Addressing these challenges requires innovative labeling schemes and effective model architectures that can adapt and learn from the complexities present in the data.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: We argue that a clarifying question between the question and answers is an important aspect of judging the relevance and usefulness of the QA pair.Therefore, we train a sequence-to-sequence model to generate useful clarifying questions for a given post, which can fill the lexical gap between the questions and answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of generating clarifying questions for technical Q&A sites.‚Ä¢We present a novel method to constructing positive, neutral+, neutral-, negative training samples via four heuristic rules, which can greatly save the time consuming and labor intensive labeling process.‚Ä¢We develop a weakly supervised neural network model for the answer recommendation task. For any question answer pairs, we fit the QA pair into our model to calculate the matching score between them; the higher matching score is estimated by our model, the better chance the answer will be selected as the best answer. In particular,
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: from Section 2, the answer hungry phenomenon widely exists in technical Q&A forums, i.e. only a small proportion of questions have an ‚Äúresolved‚Äùanswer, while many others remain unanswered and/or unresolved. Due to the reason of professionality of technical questions, only the experts with specific knowledge are qualified to evaluate the matching degree between a question and an answer. Therefore it is very hard to find such annotators and/or the creation of training sets requires a substantial manual effort. To address such a problem, We propose a novel scheme to automatically labeling each QA pair as positive, neutral+, neutral-, and negative samples. Fig¬†3 shows an example of our labeling process. We propose four heuristic rules to label the QA pairs:‚Ä¢Positive samples: for a given question QisubscriptùëÑùëñQ_{i}, we pair it with its marked ‚Äùbest‚Äù answer (if it has one) Ai‚Äã1subscriptùê¥ùëñ1A_{i1}, and label this qa pair as Positive.‚Ä¢Neutral+ samples: for a given question
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: our approach constructs four kinds of labeled data (positive, neutral+, neutral-, negative) automatically via incorporating the label establishing process. By introducing the neutral+ and neutral- training samples, our approach can learn how to separate the best answer from the similar ones, which may explain the obvious advantage of our model in P‚Äã@‚Äã1ùëÉ@1P@1.(3)Our approach also outperforms the AnswerBot by a large margin. We attribute this to the following reasons. Firstly, by adding a clarifying question into our model, we can properly fuse the information between the isolated question sentences and answers, which can reduce the lexical gap between them and better pair the answer with associated questions. Secondly, we use two parallel convolutional neural network block to learn optimal vector representation of QA pairs that preserving important syntactic and semantic features. To compute the matching score, we relate the rich representation features via a weakly supervised way
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: construct positive, neutral+, neutral-, and negative training samples. Guided by our four heuristic rules, this label establishment process can collect large amounts of labeled QA pairs, which greatly saves the time-consuming and labor-intensive labeling process.7.1.3. Deep Neural Network for Answer RecommendationWe present a weakly supervised neural network for the answer recommendation task in technical Q&A sites. Our model architecture is able to incorporate the aforementioned four types of training samples for ranking QA pairs. Our work first uses the deep neural network to solve the problem of best answer selection in technical Q&A sites, which is able to alleviate the answer hungry phenomenon that widely exists in technical Q&A forums.7.2. Threats to ValidityWe have identified the following threats to validity among our study:Internal ValidityThreats to internal validity are concernedwith potential errors in our code implementation and study settings. For
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: questions.The neural language model is able to handle the uncertainty in the correspondence between the questions and clarifying questions. Our approach automatically learns common patterns automatically from the ‚ü®q,c‚Äãq‚ü©ùëûùëêùëû\langle q,cq\rangle pairs.The encoder itself is a neural language model which is able to remember the likelihood of different kinds of questions. Following that, the decoder learns the context of the questions fills the gap between the questions and clarifying questions.7.1.2. Label Establishment for Data AugmentationDue to the reason of the professional questions in technical Q&A sites, it is thus very hard, if not possible, to find experts and annotators for manual labeling the QA pairs. In this paper, we present a novel labeling scheme to automatically construct positive, neutral+, neutral-, and negative training samples. Guided by our four heuristic rules, this label establishment process can collect large amounts of labeled QA pairs, which greatly
