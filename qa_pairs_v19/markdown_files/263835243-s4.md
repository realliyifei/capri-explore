## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

Regularization-based methods and replay methods are two distinct yet effective strategies used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, each with its underlying principles and mechanisms.

Regularization-based methods prevent the model from significantly altering important parameters that correspond to previously learned tasks. A common approach is Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), which introduces a penalty to limit changes in parameters deemed critical for maintaining performance on prior tasks [1][3]. This method effectively enhances the capacity of neural networks to remember older tasks by identifying crucial parameters and safeguarding them during training with new data. Other regularization techniques, such as Learning Without Forgetting (LwF) and Synaptic Intelligence (SI), also work by constraining adjustments to parameters that are essential for older tasks [1][4]. By incorporating these penalties into the loss function, regularization-based methods help ensure that the knowledge gained from previous tasks is retained even as new tasks are learned [2][5].

On the other hand, replay methods focus on the concept of revisiting past experiences to reinforce learning. These methods maintain a "replay buffer" filled with samples from completed tasks. During training on new tasks, models are fine-tuned using this buffer, allowing them to review and reinforce what they learned previously [2][3]. For instance, Experience Replay (ER) and Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning (iCaRL) exemplify this approach, where historical data plays a crucial role in reviewing past tasks and preventing forgetting [3]. Recent advances in replay methods have also included generative approaches that synthesize data from past tasks, further enhancing the effectiveness of replay mechanisms. For example, capabilities of ensuring both short-term and long-term memory can be explored through dual-memory systems [4].

Both strategies are not mutually exclusive; they can be integrated to form more robust systems for continual learning. For instance, one could apply regularization techniques alongside a replay strategy to balance the retention of crucial knowledge through parameter safeguarding while also revisiting past data to reinforce learning [1][4]. The combination of these methodologies can significantly improve the model‚Äôs performance as new tasks are introduced, addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting more effectively than relying on either approach in isolation. Thus, both regularization-based methods and replay methods provide complementary mechanisms that collectively enable models to adapt to new tasks while preserving existing knowledge [2][5].

(2020)). In this work, we specifically focus on quadratic regularization techniques.Replay Based Methods: Another successful approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting is based on the idea of experience replay in biological systems. Such methods maintain a memory buffer of samples from previous tasks and fine-tune the model on this buffer while learning new tasks (Chaudhry et¬†al. (2019b); Riemer et¬†al. (2019); Aljundi et¬†al. (2019)). Shin et¬†al. (2017) train a generative model to learn previous tasks‚Äô data distributions and generate synthetic samples for experience replay while learning new tasks. Recent works have also used a gradient episodic memory

LVT¬†[38] designs a vision transformer for continual learning with replay. SCoMMER¬†[31] enforces activation sparsity along with a complementary semantic dropout mechanism to encourage consistency. Different from these methods that distill past experiences from a limited memory buffer only, we also explore future experiences mimicked on the current training data, which improves the model generalization on previous tasks.2.2 Regularization-based MethodsRegularization-based methods usually incorporate an additional penalty term into the loss function to prevent model changes in parameter or prediction spaces¬†[17]. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)¬†[19, 32], Synaptic Intelligence (SI)¬†[44], and Riemmanian Walk (RW)¬†[10] prevent the parameter changes between the new model and the old one.

Understanding the reasons due to which existing methods for preventing catastrophic forgetting work or fail can open the possibility of developing better methods.With this motivation, in this work, we analyze quadratic regularization, a popular technique for preventing catastrophic forgetting in DNNs. Specifically, quadratic regularization based methods penalize changes in model parameters that are important for maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. For example, if Œ∏nsubscriptùúÉùëõ\theta_{n} denotes model parameters corresponding to the nthsuperscriptùëõthn^{\text{th}} task, TnsubscriptùëáùëõT_{n}, then the total training loss under quadratic regularization
