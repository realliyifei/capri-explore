## Answer

## I don't know?: False

Regularization-based methods and replay methods are two distinct approaches used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, each addressing the challenge in unique ways.

**Regularization-Based Methods**: These methods typically involve adding penalties to the loss function to limit significant changes to important model parameters. For instance, quadratic regularization strategies penalize changes in parameters that are crucial for maintaining performance on previously learned tasks [5]. Techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Learning Without Forgetting (LwF) specifically aim to protect the parameters that are known to be significant for the tasks learned prior. EWC, for example, balances the need for model adaptation to new tasks while safeguarding the knowledge incorporated during earlier training phases by determining parameter significance [3]. By preventing significant updates to these critical parameters, regularization methods help retain knowledge and mitigate the decline in performance on older tasks.

**Replay-Based Methods**: In contrast, replay methods combat catastrophic forgetting by utilizing a memory buffer that contains samples from previous tasks. When learning new tasks, these models can fine-tune themselves on the old task data stored in this buffer to reinforce past knowledge [1] [2]. Experience Replay (ER) and Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning (iCaRL) are notable examples within this category that leverage historical data to facilitate ongoing learning without the degradation of prior knowledge [3]. The core principle of replay methods is to regularly review old data, helping to integrate previous learning alongside new acquisitions effectively.

While both approaches aim to address the same problem, their mechanisms differ significantly. Regularization approaches limit changes to critical model parameters to maintain knowledge, whereas replay methods emphasize learning through revisiting and reinforcing old data. The effectiveness of replay-based methods relies heavily on the strategic allocation of the replay buffer and the selection of representative samples from past tasks. This management is crucial for ensuring the replay of data is beneficial and not overwhelming to the continual learning process [3]. 

In summary, both regularization-based and replay methods are essential strategies in combating catastrophic forgetting. Regularization methods restrict harmful parameter updates, while replay methods refresh past knowledge through replay buffers, together contributing to more robust continual learning systems.

(2020)). In this work, we specifically focus on quadratic regularization techniques.Replay Based Methods: Another successful approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting is based on the idea of experience replay in biological systems. Such methods maintain a memory buffer of samples from previous tasks and fine-tune the model on this buffer while learning new tasks (Chaudhry et¬†al. (2019b); Riemer et¬†al. (2019); Aljundi et¬†al. (2019)). Shin et¬†al. (2017) train a generative model to learn previous tasks‚Äô data distributions and generate synthetic samples for experience replay while learning new tasks.

LVT¬†[38] designs a vision transformer for continual learning with replay. SCoMMER¬†[31] enforces activation sparsity along with a complementary semantic dropout mechanism to encourage consistency. Different from these methods that distill past experiences from a limited memory buffer only, we also explore future experiences mimicked on the current training data, which improves the model generalization on previous tasks.2.2 Regularization-based MethodsRegularization-based methods usually incorporate an additional penalty term into the loss function to prevent model changes in parameter or prediction spaces¬†[17].

Understanding the reasons due to which existing methods for preventing catastrophic forgetting work or fail can open the possibility of developing better methods.With this motivation, in this work, we analyze quadratic regularization, a popular technique for preventing catastrophic forgetting in DNNs. Specifically, quadratic regularization based methods penalize changes in model parameters that are important for maintaining performance on previously learned tasks.
