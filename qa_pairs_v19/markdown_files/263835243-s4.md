## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

Regularization-based methods and replay methods are two prominent strategies used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, each addressing this challenge through different mechanisms.

**Regularization-Based Methods**: These approaches typically incorporate an additional penalty term into the loss function to prevent significant changes to the model parameters that are crucial for retaining knowledge from previously learned tasks. Notable techniques include Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Learning Without Forgetting (LwF) [3] [4]. These methods identify which parameters are important for maintaining performance on past tasks and apply penalties to limit the updates of these parameters when learning new tasks [5]. For example, EWC selectively limits changes based on how important a parameter was for prior tasks, balancing the adaptation to new tasks while trying to preserve the accuracy on old tasks [3].

The effectiveness of regularization methods depends greatly on accurately determining the significance of each parameter with respect to previous knowledge [3]. If applied correctly, they allow the model to adapt to new information while minimizing the degradation of performance on earlier tasks.

**Replay-Based Methods**: In contrast, replay methods utilize a memory buffer that contains historical samples from previous tasks. During training on new tasks, the model intermittently revisits this stored data to reinforce learning from earlier tasks [2] [4]. The central idea behind these methods is to simulate the experience of reviewing old tasks by replaying their data, which helps to refresh the model‚Äôs memories and integrate them with new information. Techniques such as Experience Replay and Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning (iCaRL) leverage this buffer effectively to retain old knowledge and avoid catastrophic forgetting [3]. However, these methods encounter challenges in managing the size of the buffer and selecting the most representative samples from the past tasks [3].

Additionally, there are hybrid approaches, such as CLS-ER, which combine elements of replay with memory mechanisms to enhance long-term retention of information by organizing memories in both short-term and long-term layers [4].

Both regularization and replay methods ultimately aim to alleviate the issue of catastrophic forgetting‚Äîwhere the model forgets previously learned information upon acquiring new knowledge‚Äîby either restricting necessary parameter updates through penalties or by revisiting past experiences to reinforce previous knowledge [2] [5]. By doing so, they create a balanced learning environment conducive to continual adaptation.

In summary, regularization methods prevent detrimental updates to key parameters, while replay methods ensure that old knowledge is continually reviewed and integrated into the learning process. Both strategies are crucial for advancing the capabilities of neural networks in continual learning scenarios.

(2020)). In this work, we specifically focus on quadratic regularization techniques.Replay Based Methods: Another successful approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting is based on the idea of experience replay in biological systems. Such methods maintain a memory buffer of samples from previous tasks and fine-tune the model on this buffer while learning new tasks (Chaudhry et¬†al. (2019b); Riemer et¬†al. (2019); Aljundi et¬†al. (2019)). Shin et¬†al. (2017) train a generative model to learn previous tasks‚Äô data distributions and generate synthetic samples for experience replay while learning new tasks.

LVT¬†[38] designs a vision transformer for continual learning with replay. SCoMMER¬†[31] enforces activation sparsity along with a complementary semantic dropout mechanism to encourage consistency. Different from these methods that distill past experiences from a limited memory buffer only, we also explore future experiences mimicked on the current training data, which improves the model generalization on previous tasks.2.2 Regularization-based MethodsRegularization-based methods usually incorporate an additional penalty term into the loss function to prevent model changes in parameter or prediction spaces¬†[17].

Understanding the reasons due to which existing methods for preventing catastrophic forgetting work or fail can open the possibility of developing better methods.With this motivation, in this work, we analyze quadratic regularization, a popular technique for preventing catastrophic forgetting in DNNs. Specifically, quadratic regularization based methods penalize changes in model parameters that are important for maintaining performance on previously learned tasks.
