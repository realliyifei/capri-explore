## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The provided context does not contain relevant information regarding the specific innovations that allowed phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) to outperform early word-based SMT models. The passages primarily discuss the transition from rule-based methods to SMT and then to Neural Machine Translation (NMT), without detailing the innovations or mechanisms that differentiated phrase-based SMT from word-based SMT.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: rules crafted by experts and extensive lexicons, but they were often labor-intensive and brittle when applied to complex languages. SMT, introduced in the 1990s, offered a data-driven approach, where models learned translation probabilities from bilingual text corpora. However, SMT required large volumes of parallel data, which was a significant limitation for low-resource languages, and its reliance on phrase-based techniques often failed to capture complex linguistic phenomena like morphology and syntax in underrepresented languages.With the advent of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), particularly sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with attention mechanisms, the field of Machine Translation entered a new era. NMT demonstrated superior performance over SMT in many language pairs by leveraging deep learning to create richer representations of source and target sentences. However, NMT’s effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of large datasets, making it less applicable
