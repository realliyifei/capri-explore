## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

The context provided hints at several methodologies and supplementary losses that have been employed to enhance the effectiveness of contrastive loss in sentence representation learning. 

One such method mentioned is the introduction of supplementary samples. These samples are designed to counteract biases that may arise from the uniformity of surface structures, thereby bolstering the sentence representation capability of models [3]. While the integration of supplementary samples can significantly enhance performance, it does introduce challenges, particularly with respect to augmented polarity within sentence representations. This means that models utilizing supplementary samples might exhibit an increased tendency to assign extreme scores (either higher or lower) to sentence pairs based on semantic similarity, which could affect the reliability of the model's outputs [5].

Moreover, various advanced strategies have been developed which focus on refining specific aspects of the contrastive learning framework. For example, DCLR emphasizes the refinement of negative sample selection, a crucial element in contrastive learning that directly impacts the quality and effectiveness of the contrasting process [3]. By focusing on how negative samples are chosen, the model can improve the discrepancy it learns between positive and negative representations, thereby refining its overall performance in sentence representation tasks.

Another methodology referenced is PromptBERT, which enhances the quality of sentence embeddings generated by BERT framework in SimCSE. This method adopts a prompt-based approach to further enrich the representations and potentially mitigate the aspects where standard applications of contrastive loss might falter [3]. Ultimately, these enhancements contribute to adjusting the effectiveness of contrastive loss in generating robust sentence embeddings.

As a whole, these supplementary losses and methodologies illustrate a trend towards combining various techniques focuses on reducing bias and improving the representational quality of sentence embeddings, demonstrating a nuanced approach to contrastive learning in NLP. Each method may yield different effects on the model performance, necessitating careful consideration based on the specific downstream tasks [4]. 

In summary, the incorporation of supplementary samples, improvements in negative sample selection through approaches like DCLR, and advancements such as PromptBERT contribute various supplementary losses and methods that augment the traditional contrastive loss, enhancing its effectiveness in sentence representation learning.

[1]:  Passage ID 1: representation tasks.2.2 Contrastive Learning for NLPContrastive learning (He et¬†al., 2020; Chen et¬†al., 2020) has garnered significant success in natural language processing by minimizing the distance between positive samples and maximizing the separation between negative samples (Gao et¬†al., 2021; Wu et¬†al., 2021; Yan et¬†al., 2021; Kim et¬†al., 2021). Recently, the concepts of alignment and uniformity (Wang and Isola, 2020) have been introduced as metrics for assessing the quality of representations derived from contrastive learning. Alignment evaluates the proximity of positive sample pairs, whereas uniformity assesses the impact of anisotropy on the spatial distribution of embeddings.Based on the aforementioned research, SimCSE (Gao et¬†al., 2021) is introduced by researchers as a seminal contribution to the field. It leverages the inherent randomness of the dropout noise to enrich the latent space of semantically aligned sentences, thereby generating diverse sentence

The Contrastive Training procedure utilizes the generated texts to improve video-language context understanding. The Importance Estimation Module uses both the sentence and word representations (denoted as <SENT> and <WORD> respectively) to assign a weight to the losses associated with each of the negative samples.Multi-modal video-language joint learning tasks such as moment retrieval and video retrieval aim to establish meaningful alignment between the embedding spaces of textual and visual modalities [43, 41].Recent advancements in the field have leveraged pre-trained encoders, e.g., CLIP [34], as the feature extractor. They also use contrastive loss to align global or fine-grained representations of the text and video embeddings. Models utilizing global representations [30, 13] typically focus on [CLS] token for text and

While the impact is considerable, this strategy may escalate computational demands and introduce polarity within sentence representations. On the other hand, PromptBERT (Jiang et¬†al., 2022) enhances the quality of sentence embeddings produced by BERT (Devlin et¬†al., 2018) in SimcSE framework, employing a prompt-based method (Zhou et¬†al., 2022). DCLR (Zhou et¬†al., 2022) concentrates on refining the capacity for negative sample selection. ArcCSE (Zhang et¬†al., 2022b) directly targets the optimization of the objective function. Nonetheless, these methodologies are predominantly contingent upon the inherent quality of the training data, exhibit challenges in portability, and demonstrate only modest enhancements in the capability of sentence representation.2.3

Previous studies have directly employed pre-trained language models (PLM), such as BERT (Devlin et¬†al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et¬†al., 2019), to derive high-quality sentence representations which still perform poorly in specific downstream tasks (e.g. semantic similarity task (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019)) without fine-tuning. Consequently, contrastive learning facilitate the emergence of more advanced methods (Gao et¬†al., 2021; Yan et¬†al., 2021) which
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: et¬†al., 2024; Zhuo et¬†al., 2023) have identified several drawbacks associated with the generation of positive samples based on the same original sentence and dropout. These insights have spurred the development of numerous advanced works that address these issues, resulting in significant performance improvements. Although these works target different problems, they share a discrete augmentation method: the introduction of supplementary samples tailored to the specific challenges they aim to overcome. Although the approach of incorporating supplementary samples has yielded impressive and intuitive performance in downstream tasks, it concurrently introduces novel challenges:‚Ä¢The incorporation of supplementary samples is anticipated to augment the polarity of the sentence representation model. In essence, from the perspective of semantic similarity, models augmented with supplementary samples are more likely to assign higher or lower scores to sentences based on their similarity. To
