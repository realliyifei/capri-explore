## Answer

## I don't know?: False

General-purpose metrics are insufficient for evaluating pronoun-aware translation quality in zero pronoun translation (ZPT) primarily because they fail to accurately capture the nuances and specific challenges associated with pronoun translation. Standard metrics like BLEU do not account for the critical role that pronouns play in conveying meaning within sentences, leading to potential misrepresentation of translation quality.

1. **Inability to Measure Pronoun Accuracy**: In ZPT, the omission or incorrect placement of pronouns can have significant effects on the overall meaning of a translated sentence. However, general-purpose metrics do not adequately address these nuances. For instance, the missed or incorrect pronouns may not impact BLEU scores but can severely affect true translation performance, indicating a gap in how these metrics assess the quality of translation [2]. This oversight is critical, as the essence of pronoun resolution is often lost in translations, particularly from pro-drop languages where pronouns are frequently omitted.

2. **Complexity of Contextual Reference**: Pronouns typically rely on contextual cues to be correctly understood. Human translators can infer the missing pronouns based on context, while MT systems may struggle with this subtleness [1]. The failure to recognize and correctly translate these pronouns leads to translations lacking completeness and correctness, elements that cannot be effectively judged by standard metrics. Thus, without evaluation methods specifically designed to target pronoun usage, the full extent of ZPT challenges remains unmeasured.

3. **Need for Targeted Metrics**: Several studies have highlighted this limitation, showing that the general-purpose evaluation methods were unable to intricately evaluate ZPT's performance [2][5]. To accurately assess the translation involving zero pronouns, more targeted evaluation metrics are required that focus on pronoun resolution and usage, rather than just overall grammatical correctness and fluency. This indicates a necessity for metrics that can discern between successful and unsuccessful pronoun translations, which impacts the referential integrity of translated text.

In conclusion, the reliance on general-purpose metrics like BLEU fails to comprehensively evaluate pronoun-aware translation quality in ZPT due to their inability to address the specific challenges and complexities associated with pronoun usage. This necessitates the development of specialized methodologies that can effectively evaluate the true performance and quality of translations that involve zero pronouns [5].

(2021), and machine translation Wang (2019).When translating texts from pro-drop to non-pro-drop languages (e.g. Chinese⇒⇒\RightarrowEnglish), this phenomenon leads to serious problems for translation models in terms of: 1) completeness, since translation of such invisible pronouns cannot be normally reproduced; 2) correctness, because understanding the semantics of a source sentence needs to identifying and resolving the pronominal reference.Figure 1 shows ZP examples in three typological patterns determined by language family (detailed in Appendix §A.1). Taking a full-drop language for instance, the first-person subject and third-person object pronouns are omitted in Hindi input while these pronouns are all compulsory in English translation. This is not a problem for human beings since we can easily recall these missing pronoun from the context. However, even a real-life MT system still fails to accurately translate ZPs.Figure 1:

METEOR Banerjee and Lavie (2005) incorporates semantic information by calculating either exact match, stem match, or synonymy match. Furthermore, COMET Rei et al. (2020) is a neural framework for training multilingual MT evaluation models which obtains new SOTA levels of correlation with human judgements.•Pronoun-Aware Translation Quality: Previous works usually evaluate ZPT using the BLEU metric Wang et al. (2016a, 2018a); Yu et al. (2020); Ri et al. (2021), however, general-purpose metrics cannot characterize the performance of ZP translation. As shown in Table 5.2, the missed or incorrect pronouns may not affect BLEU scores but severely harm true performances. To fix this gap, some works proposed pronoun-targeted evaluation metrics Werlen and Popescu-Belis (2017); Läubli et al.

[5]: Passage ID 5: works that have been undertaken in zero pronoun translation (ZPT) after the neural revolution, so that researchers can recognise the current state and future directions of this field. We provide an organisation of the literature based on evolution, dataset, method and evaluation. In addition, we compare and analyze competing models and evaluation metrics on different benchmarks. We uncover a number of insightful findings such as: 1) ZPT is in line with the development trend of large language model; 2) data limitation cause learning bias in languages and domains; 3) performance improvements are often reported on single benchmarks, but advanced methods are still far from real-world use; 4) general-purpose metrics are not reliable on nuances and complexities of ZPT, emphasizing the necessity of targeted metrics; 5) apart from commonly-cited errors, ZPs will cause risks of gender bias.1 IntroductionPronouns play an important role in natural language, as they enable speakers to refer
