## Answer (I don't know?: âœ“)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information about typological information, its role in enhancing performance, or any specific methodologies related to multilingual dependency parsing. Therefore, it is insufficient to answer the question accurately.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: adjective, adverb and so on (Part of Speech Tagging). At the semantic level, each word is analyzed to get the meaningful representation of the sentence. Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Information Extraction (IE) refers to the use of computational methods to identify relevant pieces of information in document generated for human use and convert this information into a representation suitable for computer based storage, processing, and retrieval (Wimalasuriya and Dua, 2010). The input to IE system is a collection of documents (email, web pages, news groups, news articles, business reports, research papers, blogs, resumes,

Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence.
