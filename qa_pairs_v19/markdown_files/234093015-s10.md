## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Data augmentation techniques have been adapted for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks to enhance model performance by artificially increasing the amount and diversity of training data. This is particularly significant in specialized fields like science and biology, where annotated data can be scarce or challenging to generate [1] [2].

One effective approach to data augmentation is to apply transformations to existing data, which helps generate new data samples. These transformations include various methods such as synonym replacement, random deletion, random insertion, and back-translation, among others [3] [4]. By diversifying the vocabulary and sentence structures associated with entities, these techniques create new instances while preserving the essential context and relationships within the data [1]. For example, a sentence might be altered from "I have a cat named Serena" to "You have a dog named Beethoven," thereby enriching the training dataset without losing core information related to entity recognition [2].

In addition to traditional methods, more sophisticated generative techniques have been developed. These can create entirely new data samples, further aiding in overcoming the limitations imposed by small datasets [4]. Importantly, these techniques are geared toward maintaining the core structure and relationships of the original sentences, which is crucial for the effective performance of NER models that focus on word-level predictions rather than sentence-level predictions [3].

Recent research, including work by Fabregat et al. (2023), has explored specific architectures such as Bi-LSTM and CRF models aimed at detecting biomedical named entities, highlighting the tailored approaches that have been developed for NER tasks within specialized domains [5]. The application of data augmentation in such contexts not only bolsters the quantity of training data available but also enriches the contextual detail that models can learn from, thereby enhancing their predictive performance.

Ultimately, the adaptation of data augmentation techniques for NER is a vital strategy to address data scarcity challenges, increase the robustness of model training, and improve overall performance. This multifaceted approach results in a more diverse and representative training set that leads to greater accuracy and reliability in NER outcomes [1] [2] [5].

Our study introduces a novel guidance data augmentation technique utilizing abstracted context and sentence structures to produce varied sentences while maintaining context-entity relationships, addressing data scarcity challenges. By fostering a closer relationship between context, sentence structure, and role of entities, our method enhances data augmentation’s effectiveness. Consequently, by showcasing diversification in both entity-related vocabulary and overall sentence structure, and simultaneously improving the training performance of named entity recognition task.1 IntroductionThe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed remarkable success across various domains in recent years, primarily attributed to the availability of rich and high-quality data. However, specialized fields such as science and biology face significant challenges due to the scarcity of such quality data. Particularly, tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) face
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: and testing of NER models [10, 11], there is a growing interest in methodologies for building NER models in scenarios where annotated data are scarce or difficult to generate, as is the case with these low-resource domains [12].One such methodology is the application of data augmentation, which is a technique that improves the construction of effective NER models when annotated training data is limited or costly to obtain. This approach automatically generates new data samples by applying transformations to existing data [13, 14, 15]. Originally popularized in the field of computer vision, data augmentation is gaining traction in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including NER [4, 7, 5, 16, 17]. For example, a sentence like I have a cat named Serena could be transformed into You have a dog named Beethoven or I own a cat called Serena, thereby enriching the training set. These augmented sentences maintain the core structure of the original, while introducing variations that
