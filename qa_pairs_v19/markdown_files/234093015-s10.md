## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Data augmentation techniques have been specifically adapted for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks to enhance model performance through several innovative approaches. These methods are particularly crucial in specialized fields like science and biology, where there is often a scarcity of high-quality annotated data necessary for training effective NER models [1][5].

One of the primary adaptations involves the technique of generating new training samples by applying transformations to existing data. For instance, sentence variations that maintain the original structure are crafted to enrich the training dataset. A sentence like "I have a cat named Serena" could be transformed into different versions such as "You have a dog named Beethoven" or "I own a cat called Serena." This versatility in sentence generation not only diversifies the vocabulary associated with entities but also sustains the relationships between context and entities, which is critical in NER tasks [2][1].

Moreover, recent methodologies have introduced novel data augmentation techniques that utilize large language models (LLMs) to generate sentences. These models leverage few-shot learning or external modules to add valuable context, helping to address the unique challenges of domain-specific vocabulary. Such techniques ensure that the NER models can better recognize entities within their specific contexts, thereby improving overall training performance [5].

Traditional data augmentation methods, which have risen from their origins in computer vision, have also been adapted for NLP tasks including NER. These methods encompass several strategies like synonym replacement, random deletion, random insertion, and back-translation, which artificially increase the dataset size. However, it is worth noting that NER primarily focuses on predicting individual words rather than entire sentences. Therefore, it necessitates tailored approaches that consider the specific role of words in context [3][2]. 

Transfer learning has emerged as another significant adaptation for enhancing NER performance. This involves pretraining a model on a large corpus of general text data and then fine-tuning it with the smaller, specific NER dataset. By doing so, the model leverages the broader knowledge acquired during pretraining to improve its performance in recognizing named entities more effectively [4].

In summary, data augmentation for NER tasks has evolved to include structured transformations of existing sentences, the use of LLMs for generating contextually relevant data, and the incorporation of transfer learning techniques. These strategies collectively aim to tackle the challenges posed by data scarcity and domain specificity, ultimately leading to enhancements in model accuracy and robustness in recognizing named entities [1][5][4].

Our study introduces a novel guidance data augmentation technique utilizing abstracted context and sentence structures to produce varied sentences while maintaining context-entity relationships, addressing data scarcity challenges. By fostering a closer relationship between context, sentence structure, and role of entities, our method enhances data augmentation’s effectiveness. Consequently, by showcasing diversification in both entity-related vocabulary and overall sentence structure, and simultaneously improving the training performance of named entity recognition task.1 IntroductionThe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed remarkable success across various domains in recent years, primarily attributed to the availability of rich and high-quality data. However, specialized fields such as science and biology face significant challenges due to the scarcity of such quality data. Particularly, tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) face
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: and testing of NER models [10, 11], there is a growing interest in methodologies for building NER models in scenarios where annotated data are scarce or difficult to generate, as is the case with these low-resource domains [12].One such methodology is the application of data augmentation, which is a technique that improves the construction of effective NER models when annotated training data is limited or costly to obtain. This approach automatically generates new data samples by applying transformations to existing data [13, 14, 15]. Originally popularized in the field of computer vision, data augmentation is gaining traction in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including NER [4, 7, 5, 16, 17]. For example, a sentence like I have a cat named Serena could be transformed into You have a dog named Beethoven or I own a cat called Serena, thereby enriching the training set. These augmented sentences maintain the core structure of the original, while introducing variations that

(2023) proposed several architectures based on a Bi-LSTM and a CRF in order to detect biomedical named entities.5.2 Data augmentationData augmentation artificially increases the amount of training data by creating modified copies of a dataset using existing data. This includes making small changes to data (Dai and Adel, 2020; Sawai et al., 2021; Duong and Nguyen-Thi, 2021) (synonym replacement, random deletion, random insertion, random swap, back-translation, lexical substitution, etc.) or using generative methods to create new data (Sharma et al., ; Keraghel et al., 2020).The application of data augmentation techniques to NLP has been done in areas including, for example, text classification (Dai and Adel, 2020; Karimi et al., 2021), machine translation (Sawai et al., 2021), and sentiment analysis (Duong and Nguyen-Thi, 2021).However, unlike other NLP tasks, NER makes predictions about words, and not about sentences. Therefore,

This approach leverages the knowledge learned from the general data to improve performance on the specific task. A number of studies have been carried out on transfer learning. Lee et al. (2017) looked at transfer learning using RNN in the anonymization of health data. Authors like (Francis et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021b) explored the use of transformers for NER, and showed that transfer learning significantly improves performance. Recently, Fabregat et al.

Particularly, tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) face significant difficulties due to domain-specific characteristics where vocabulary roles diverge from general usage, necessitating specialized knowledge for effective data collection.To overcome the data shortage issue, various automated data augmentation (DA) techniques have been developed, including a recent approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for sentence generation to perform DA Whitehouse et al. (2023b).Utilizing LLMs for DA involves employing few-shot learning or external modules Zhuang et al. (2023) to provide additional information. In NER tasks, DA is applied with a focus on entities, maintaining the sentence’s core structure with minimal alterations. This approach faces limitations in effectively augmenting cases like specific domain data, where vocabulary
