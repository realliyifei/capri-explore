Data augmentation techniques have been notably adapted for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance model performance, particularly in scenarios where annotated data is limited. This adaptation addresses the critical challenge of data scarcity that specialized fields, such as science and biology, face [1] [2].

One primary method of data augmentation in NER involves the generation of new data samples from existing annotated data by applying various transformations. These transformations include techniques such as synonym replacement, random deletion, random insertion, random swap, back-translation, and lexical substitution. Such methods adjust the original sentences while preserving the essential context and the relationships between entities [3] [4]. For instance, a sentence like "I have a cat named Serena" can be transformed into "You have a dog named Beethoven" or "I own a cat called Serena," which helps in enriching the training set while maintaining the core structure related to the entities involved [2].

The unique aspect of NER lies in its focus on word-level predictions rather than sentence-level interpretations. This distinguishes NER from other NLP tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis, where the entire sentence and its sentiment might be the focus. Consequently, while text augmentation techniques can be applied broadly, NER demands careful consideration to ensure that modifications do not distort the identity or context of the named entities [3] [4]. 

Moreover, recent innovations in the field have involved more sophisticated modeling techniques such as the use of Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks combined with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) specifically tailored for detecting biomedical named entities. These architectures benefit from data augmentation by fostering a more robust understanding of context, thus improving overall performance on NER tasks [3][4].

In essence, the adaptation of data augmentation for NER tasks not only facilitates the production of larger, more diverse training datasets but also refines model training by enhancing the contextual awareness around entities. This ultimately leads to improved performance in recognizing and categorizing entities successfully. The efficacy of these techniques has been recognized as increasingly important in addressing the limitations imposed by low-resource annotated datasets, affirming their role in advancing the capabilities of NER methodologies in specialized domains [2][4].

Our study introduces a novel guidance data augmentation technique utilizing abstracted context and sentence structures to produce varied sentences while maintaining context-entity relationships, addressing data scarcity challenges. By fostering a closer relationship between context, sentence structure, and role of entities, our method enhances data augmentation’s effectiveness. Consequently, by showcasing diversification in both entity-related vocabulary and overall sentence structure, and simultaneously improving the training performance of named entity recognition task.1 IntroductionThe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed remarkable success across various domains in recent years, primarily attributed to the availability of rich and high-quality data. However, specialized fields such as science and biology face significant challenges due to the scarcity of such quality data. Particularly, tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) face

[2]:  Passage ID 2: and testing of NER models [10, 11], there is a growing interest in methodologies for building NER models in scenarios where annotated data are scarce or difficult to generate, as is the case with these low-resource domains [12].One such methodology is the application of data augmentation, which is a technique that improves the construction of effective NER models when annotated training data is limited or costly to obtain. This approach automatically generates new data samples by applying transformations to existing data [13, 14, 15]. Originally popularized in the field of computer vision, data augmentation is gaining traction in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including NER [4, 7, 5, 16, 17]. For example, a sentence like I have a cat named Serena could be transformed into You have a dog named Beethoven or I own a cat called Serena, thereby enriching the training set. These augmented sentences maintain the core structure of the original, while introducing variations that
