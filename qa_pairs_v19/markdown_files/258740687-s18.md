Researchers are focusing on improving zero pronoun translation (ZPT) performance through auxiliary methods that do not require changes to the core machine translation (MT) architecture. One crucial approach involved developing an augmentation method that enhances training signals, allowing the translation model to better learn the correlations between local context and zero pronouns. This method has reportedly led to significant improvements in accuracy during machine translation experiments, particularly in conversational domains [2].

Moreover, the utilization of large language models (LLMs) offers another promising avenue for enhancing translation performance. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, researchers aim to address complex translation tasks, specifically focusing on improving zero pronoun handling without altering the underlying neural machine translation (NMT) architecture [1]. The research trajectory includes evaluating performance through comprehensive benchmarks, such as the GuoFeng Benchmark, which are designed to assess various discourse-level translation tasks [1] [3].

Additionally, researchers are contemplating the role of adaptive machine translation (MT) techniques, which adjust translation outputs based on continuous feedback and human interaction. These methods can be crucial in instances where specialized project data is scarce, enabling translation models to absorb new information without the need for re-architecting the models themselves [4]. In situations where there is insufficient in-domain data, the integration of domain-specific text generation using LLMs is explored, allowing for fine-tuning of existing MT models with enhanced synthetic bilingual data [4].

In summary, the current strategies for improving ZPT performance concentrate on enhancing training methodologies and utilizing auxiliary tools like LLMs, along with adaptive techniques that allow for context-sensitive translations. These approaches align well within the frameworks of existing machine translation systems without necessitating any architectural changes. The collective insights drawn from various research findings provide a promising path forward in the effective handling of zero pronouns in translation tasks [2] [4] [5].

Our plan is to leverage large language models, which have shown great potential in dealing with complex tasks, to tackle this particular challenge Lu et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023b); Lyu et al. (2023). Moreover, we plan to evaluate our approach on more discourse-aware tasks. Specifically, we aim to utilize the GuoFeng Benchmark Wang et al. (2022, 2023a), which presents a comprehensive testing ground for evaluating the performance of models on a variety of discourse-level translation tasks. By doing so, we hope to gain more insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our approach, and continually refine it to achieve

However, when translating them into English, the omitted words must be explicitly translated in most cases. For example, in the following sentence, the subject omitted in Japanese is the first person, and I has to be output in

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: I examined how to leverage language modelling techniques in general and LLMs in particular to improve translation features that involve human interaction and continuous feedback, such as adaptive MT, terminology-constrained MT, domain-aware automatic post-editing, auto-suggestion and auto-completion. In the second research question, I addressed a common scenario in the translation industry, namely receiving highly specialised projects, where there is hardly any parallel in-domain data. In such scenarios where there is insufficient in-domain data to fine-tune MT models, producing translations that are consistent with the relevant context is challenging. One way to address this question is through domain-specific text generation with LLMs and then fine-tuning an MT model using the generated bilingual in-domain synthetic data. Furthermore, this question overlaps with the first question, since real-time adaptive MT with LLMs can serve as an alternative approach to address in-domain data

Furthermore, we explored key factors contributing to the model’s performance improvement, including but not limited to the design of the network architecture, optimization of training strategies, and adjustment of hyperparameters. These analyses not only deepen our understanding of the model’s internal working mechanisms but also provide valuable insights and guidance for future research, especially in terms of further enhancing the performance and application scope of machine translation systems.2 PreliminaryMachine translation, as an important branch of the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to achieve automatic conversion from one language to another. Early machine translation methods were primarily based on rules and dictionaries. Since the mid-20th century, machine translation has undergone a transition from rule-based translation to statistical methods Brown et al. (1993); Lopez (2008), and to the current Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
