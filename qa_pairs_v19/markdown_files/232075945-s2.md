## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Stance detection is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) focused on identifying the author's attitude or stance towards a specific target, which can be an entity, concept, or event. This task is typically categorized into positions such as support, opposition, or neutrality, depending on the stance that the author expresses [1]. The technique is essential for analyzing opinions expressed in user-generated content, particularly on social media platforms where public sentiments are frequently shared [1] [4].

The primary goal of stance detection is to predict the general public's outlook on specific target keywords, allowing researchers and analysts to gain insights into societal sentiments and trends. For instance, in the example of the tweet “Everyone should get the COVID-19 vaccine,” the stance detected is positive towards the COVID-19 vaccine as the target [2]. This functionality can be pivotal in various applications, including evaluating public acceptance of legislation [2], gauging support for health measures [3], and examining consumer opinions on products [2]. 

Stance detection differs from other related NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, by its focus on the relationship between the author’s viewpoint and a specific target, rather than an overall sentiment. While sentiment analysis often assesses whether the overall tone of a text is positive, negative, or neutral, stance detection emphasizes the author’s perspective regarding a targeted subject [2] [4]. For example, sentiment analysis might categorize a review of a movie as positive, while stance detection would determine whether the opinion is supportive or critical of the film itself as a specific target [1] [4].

Additionally, stance detection has evolved from traditional methods to advanced models leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs). Early approaches primarily employed rule-based systems or traditional machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines (SVMs). These methods have transitioned to deep learning models, which can analyze vast amounts of data and detect complex patterns in text more effectively [5]. The introduction of LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 has further revolutionized stance detection capabilities by improving accuracy through instruction fine-tuning and in-context learning [1].

Moreover, the perspective-aware models in stance detection consider multiple annotations from diverse human annotators, which enhances the classification performance of stance detection tasks. This approach accounts for varying perspectives and reduces biases that may arise from a singular viewpoint [3]. By integrating diverse human judgments, stance detection can deliver more reliable results, differentiating it from other NLP tasks that might not incorporate such nuanced human insights [3].

In summary, stance detection is a crucial NLP task aimed at identifying explicit attitudes toward specific targets, distinguishing itself from broader sentiment analysis by its targeted focus, application spectrum, and the advanced methodologies employed to harness data and human insights for comprehensive analysis.

The increasing availability of massive amounts of textual data has created a need to automatically analyze the opinions, emotions, and stances expressed. This is because understanding the stance tendencies of the public offers significant benefits for political analysis, public opinion polling, and rumor detection. Hence, stance detection has been an active topic in NLP. Stance detection aims to identify the author’s attitude or stance towards a specific target (such as an entity, concept, or event)Mohammad, typically classified into categories such as support, opposition, or neutrality.Figure 1: The overall architecture of CoS.Recently, the advents of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT111https://chat.openai.com/, GPT-4Achiam et al.

2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: data. In natural language processing (NLP), the task of predicting the general public’s outlook for specific target keyword(s) is called stance detection. The target represents the subject or topic of interest, while the stance reflects the prevailing attitude or position. As an example from the tweet “Everyone should get the COVID-19 vaccine”, a positive stance is posited toward COVID-19 vaccine as the target. Stance detection has had diverse applications in tasks such as investigating users’ opinions on a new product [1], understanding public acceptance of a newly proposed legislation [2], and determining support for public health measures [3].Stance detection models have been proposed under two constructs, namely, the single-target and cross-target scenarios. The single-target scenario determines users’ opinions toward a single, fixed target [4], while cross-target methods extend the model’s versatility to address multiple targets [5]. In single-target cases, the training set

Traditional methods often aggregate multiple annotations into a single ground truth, disregarding the diversity in perspectives that arises from annotator disagreement. In this preliminary study, we examine the effect of including multiple annotations on model accuracy in classification. Our methodology investigates the performance of perspective- aware classification models in stance detection task and further inspects if annotator disagreement affects the model confidence. The results show that multi-perspective approach yields better classification performance outperforming the baseline which
