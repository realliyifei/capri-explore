## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not include any information about stance detection or its relationship to other NLP tasks. Therefore, I cannot accurately answer the question based on the given passages. The text addresses natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), question answering (QA), and related deep learning models but does not mention stance detection or its comparative analysis with other tasks in NLP.

[1]: Passage ID 1: Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with text understanding and text generation. The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their

[4]: Passage ID 4: have produced state-of-the-art results in many domains. Recently, a variety of model designs and methods have blossomed in the context of natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we review significant deep learning related models and methods that have been employed for numerous NLP tasks and provide a walk-through of their evolution. We also summarize, compare and contrast the various models and put forward a detailed understanding of the past, present and future of deep learning in NLP.Index Terms: Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Word2Vec, Attention, Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTM, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering, Dialogue Systems, Parsing, Named-Entity Recognition, POS Tagging, Semantic Role LabelingI IntroductionNatural language processing(NLP) is a theory-motivatedrange of computational techniquesfor the automatic analysis andrepresentation of human language.NLP research has evolved from the eraof punch

The primary objective of NLG is to communicate information in a way that is comprehensible to human beings and appropriate as per the given situation. Instances include question answering [22], machine translation [3] and text summarization [23, 24].3.1 Applications of NLPSome of the renowned applications of NLP have been elucidated as follows:3.1.1 Sentiment AnalysisSentiment analysis is an application of NLP concerned with the extraction and evaluation of expressions, feelings, and orientations of people regarding a certain physical or abstract subject [1]. It has evolved over a period of time with primarily three tiers of analysis- document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. While Document-Based methods provide the overall sentiment for the entire document, they fail to capture the sentiments expressed in individual sentiments [25, 58].
