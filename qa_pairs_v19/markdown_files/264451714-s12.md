## Answer

## I don't know?: False

When assessing the effectiveness of optimized prompts in probing tasks, several key factors should be taken into consideration:

1. **Task-Specific Versus Task-Agnostic Optimization**: It's essential to differentiate between task-specific prompts (Task Prompts) and task-agnostic prompts (System Prompts). While Task Prompts are optimized for specific tasks, they may lack generalizability across different contexts. In contrast, System Prompts aim to optimize in a broader sense, and recent studies have demonstrated that optimized System Prompts can provide performance improvements comparable to Task Prompts across diverse tasks [1] [2]. Thus, evaluating the adaptability and performance consistency of these prompts across various tasks will be crucial.

2. **Performance Metrics**: The evaluation of prompt effectiveness should incorporate a range of performance metrics. Since there is no single "best" prompt, using multiple evaluation criteria allows for a comprehensive assessment of prompt performance in line with different objectives and outcomes [1] [5]. This includes quantifying improvements in accuracy, efficiency, reliability, and overall model performance.

3. **Complementarity of Prompt Types**: The interaction between System Prompt optimization and Task Prompt optimization can yield complementary benefits. Combining these methods may lead to enhanced performance across varied domains, thus allowing one to explore how the integration of both prompts can optimize outcomes further [2]. Therefore, it can be beneficial to investigate the implications of using a hybrid approach.

4. **Generalizability Across Models and Languages**: Performance benefits gained from prompt optimization should be assessed for their generalizability across different model families, sizes, and languages. Research indicates that optimized prompts retain their effectiveness across these dimensions, which is a key factor in their usability in real-world applications [2]. Testing for this aspect is vital when determining the robustness and applicability of optimized prompts.

5. **Computational Cost and Scalability**: The computational cost associated with optimizing System Prompts is typically higher than that for Task Prompts, which may pose scalability challenges in practical implementations [2]. Thus, part of assessing effectiveness should involve an analysis of the resource requirements relative to the benefits achieved, enabling users to weigh the trade-offs involved in prompt optimization.

6. **Understanding User Requirements and Challenges**: Engaging with model practitioners to understand their needs and challenges in prompt design can lead to more effective prompt engineering practices. Insights into users' experiences and requirements can guide the development of optimization techniques that better meet the practical demands of various NLP tasks [3] [4].

7. **Probing Capabilities and Multimodal Integration**: Optimized prompts should also be assessed based on their ability to facilitate probing capabilities and their effectiveness in eliciting desired knowledge, particularly in multimodal contexts. Understanding how prompts can guide models to integrate information from different modalities will reflect their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios [3] [4].

In conclusion, assessing optimized prompts requires a multifaceted approach that evaluates adaptability, metrics, computational implications, and user experience, alongside their ability to foster effective performance across diverse tasks and models.

(2023) use LLMs directly as prompt optimizers to iteratively suggest and select the best prompts. According to recent studies Wan et al. (2024), the state-of-the-art prompt optimizer is ProTeGi Pryzant et al. (2023), which leverages LLM agents to summarize errors from each iteration’s responses and refines them accordingly.Previous prompt optimization methods largely focus on optimizing the instructions for specific tasks (which we refer to as Task Prompt) which inherently have limited generalizability. However, past research has demonstrated the potential of optimizing task-agnostic prompts (which we define as System Prompt), such as the well-known Chain-of-Thought prompt Wei et al. (2022). Additionally, studies have shown that factors like personas Kim et al. (2024), generation styles Lu et al. (2023), emotions Li
