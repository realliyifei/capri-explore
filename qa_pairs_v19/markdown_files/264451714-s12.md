## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

When assessing the effectiveness of optimized prompts in probing tasks, several key factors should be considered:

1. **Types of Optimized Prompts**: It is crucial to differentiate between task-specific prompts (Task Prompts) and task-agnostic prompts (System Prompts). Optimized System Prompts have been shown to provide consistent improvements comparable to optimized Task Prompts across diverse tasks, suggesting their utility in enhancing model performance [2]. The potential for generalizability across model families, sizes, and languages when using optimized System Prompts also underscores their significance [2].

2. **Complementary Benefits**: Combining System and Task Prompt optimizations may yield complementary benefits that enhance overall model performance. This combination allows for a more robust approach, leveraging strengths from both prompt types for varied domains [2]. Therefore, the interaction between different types of prompts should be carefully evaluated.

3. **Computational Considerations**: The computational cost associated with optimizing System Prompts tends to be higher than that of task-specific methods, which raises scalability concerns for real-world applications [2]. An understanding of the trade-offs between computational efficiency and optimization effectiveness is vital in evaluating prompt strategies.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing prompt performance requires a nuanced approach to evaluation metrics, as there is no universally “best” prompt. Various metrics need to be considered, including qualitative aspects of the responses generated by the prompts, and the ability of the prompts to consistently elicit the desired output across trials [5]. This complexity necessitates a systematic examination of performance based on multiple criteria.

5. **Practical Application**: The design process for manual prompt creation should integrate principles grounded in model behavior and apply optimization algorithms to discover optimal prompts [5]. Thus, understanding how prompts can be effectively crafted and refined for specific tasks is essential for practitioners looking to enhance model performance in particular applications.

6. **User Interaction with Prompts**: Developing a deeper understanding of user requirements for prompt design can improve the effectiveness of the prompts employed. Close collaboration between NLP experts and end-users may facilitate prompt refinement that aligns with practical needs [4].

7. **Limitations and Challenges**: Finally, recognizing the limitations of existing techniques is necessary. Challenges in summarizing knowledge utilized by models for reasoning, as well as the intricate interplay of information across modalities, illustrate the complexities involved in effective prompt design [4]. 

Overall, assessing optimized prompts in probing tasks involves a multifaceted approach that incorporates considerations of prompt types, evaluation metrics, computational cost, practical applicability, and user experience, all of which are crucial for enhancing the utility and effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: making it challenging to scale up to more complex scenarios. Recently, as LLM agents get popular, powerful methods like APE Zhou et al. (2023c) and OPRO Yang et al. (2023) use LLMs directly as prompt optimizers to iteratively suggest and select the best prompts. According to recent studies Wan et al. (2024), the state-of-the-art prompt optimizer is ProTeGi Pryzant et al. (2023), which leverages LLM agents to summarize errors from each iteration’s responses and refines them accordingly.Previous prompt optimization methods largely focus on optimizing the instructions for specific tasks (which we refer to as Task Prompt) which inherently have limited generalizability. However, past research has demonstrated the potential of optimizing task-agnostic prompts (which we define as System Prompt), such as the well-known Chain-of-Thought prompt Wei et al. (2022). Additionally, studies have shown that factors like personas Kim et al. (2024), generation styles Lu et al. (2023), emotions Li

First, the computational cost of optimizing system prompts is higher compared to task-specific optimization methods even though certain pruning was applied, which could limit its scalability to real-world applications. Therefore, exploring more effective pruning or exploring
