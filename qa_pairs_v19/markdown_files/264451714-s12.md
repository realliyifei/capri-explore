## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

When assessing the effectiveness of optimized prompts in probing tasks, several key factors should be taken into consideration:

1. **Task Specificity vs. Task Agnosticism**: It is crucial to differentiate between task-specific prompts and task-agnostic prompts. Optimized task prompts are typically tailored for specific tasks, which can limit their generalizability and require new prompts for every new task [1] [4]. In contrast, system prompts, which include general instructions that can be applied across various tasks, demonstrate the potential to enhance model performance broadly and might provide a more scalable solution in the long run [3][4].

2. **Consistency and Robustness**: The stability of model performance across different prompts should be evaluated. Previous studies have revealed that the selection of prompts significantly impacts the quality of output despite the inherent search space complexity. Therefore, one must consider how semantic variations in prompts influence the model’s responses and whether certain optimized prompts maintain performance consistency [4] [5].

3. **Optimization Techniques**: The method utilized for prompt optimization can significantly affect outcomes. Recent research highlights the approach of combining both system and task prompt optimizations, which has been shown to lead to complementary benefits and improvements across various domains and tasks [2][3]. It is important to assess the effectiveness of different optimization strategies—like the state-of-the-art ProTeGi that refines prompts based on previous iterations of model performance [1]—in achieving better results.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: Another essential consideration is the computational cost associated with optimizing prompts. While system prompt optimization holds promise, it is typically more computationally expensive than traditional task-specific optimizations. This raises questions about practicality and scalability in real-world applications, necessitating evaluations of whether the benefits outweigh these costs [3] [4].

5. **Generalizability Across Models and Languages**: Effective prompt optimization should enhance performance universally across various model families, sizes, and languages. The findings indicating that optimized prompts generalize well across these variables should be a fundamental criterion in the assessment process [3]. This exploration is particularly relevant in contexts involving diverse datasets and multilingual applications.

6. **Expert Feedback and Usability**: Finally, the perceptions and usability outlined in expert interviews can provide qualitative insights into the optimized prompt systems [2]. Engaging with practitioners in the field can surface concerns and suggestions that quantitative metrics alone may miss, thus informing the assessment of prompt effectiveness from a practical standpoint.

In conclusion, a comprehensive assessment of optimized prompts in probing tasks should encompass their generalizability, consistency, optimization techniques, computational cost, and practical feedback from experts. By integrating these factors, one can arrive at a more nuanced understanding of optimized prompt effectiveness in NLP applications.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: making it challenging to scale up to more complex scenarios. Recently, as LLM agents get popular, powerful methods like APE Zhou et al. (2023c) and OPRO Yang et al. (2023) use LLMs directly as prompt optimizers to iteratively suggest and select the best prompts. According to recent studies Wan et al. (2024), the state-of-the-art prompt optimizer is ProTeGi Pryzant et al. (2023), which leverages LLM agents to summarize errors from each iteration’s responses and refines them accordingly.Previous prompt optimization methods largely focus on optimizing the instructions for specific tasks (which we refer to as Task Prompt) which inherently have limited generalizability. However, past research has demonstrated the potential of optimizing task-agnostic prompts (which we define as System Prompt), such as the well-known Chain-of-Thought prompt Wei et al. (2022). Additionally, studies have shown that factors like personas Kim et al. (2024), generation styles Lu et al. (2023), emotions Li

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: evaluating across a diverse range of tasks, we demonstrate that optimized system prompts provide consistent improvements on par with optimized task prompts. Moreover, combining system and task prompt optimizations offers complementary benefits, leading to further improvements in model performance across varied domains. Further, we find that these performance benefits for an optimized prompt generalize across (i) model families, (ii) model sizes, and (iii) different languages. Our findings highlight the potential of system prompt optimization to complement and enhance LLM performance for new languages and models.8 LimitationsDespite the promising results of Sprig, several limitations remain in our study. First, the computational cost of optimizing system prompts is higher compared to task-specific optimization methods even though certain pruning was applied, which could limit its scalability to real-world applications. Therefore, exploring more effective pruning or exploring
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: et al. (2024). Previous studies have shown that the selection of prompts can have a substantial impact on the quality of the output Reynolds and McDonell (2021).However, due to the massive search space, previous approaches have primarily focused on directly optimizing prompts to maximize performance on specific tasks or benchmarks Prasad et al. (2023); Zhou et al. (2023c); Yang et al. (2023).While effective, they are typically task-specific, requiring new prompts to be crafted for every new task. Here, we consider an alternative approach focused on optimizing the system prompt, i.e., the set of general instructions that precede any task-specific details (Figure 1), with the goal of identifying task-agnostic generalizable prompting strategies.Figure 1: LLM prompts features both system-level instructions which may include CoT instructions, personas, and other rules (orange), task-specific instructions which may include details and examples (blue), and the instance itself (green).
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: prompt engineering, the process to find the optimal prompt that yields the best performance.Prompt Consistency.Previous studies 5, 15, 16, 17 have explored the robustness of LLMs to intentional perturbations such as word deletion and sentence shuffling. Our work deviates from these perturbation-based studies, as we are interested in model performance across semantically equivalent and syntactically fluent prompts. While it is anticipated that a flawed prompt would lead to performance decline, we do not expect such performance variations in our setting.Recent research 6, 8, 7 has also examined the variability in model performance with semantically equivalent prompts. However, these studies solely focused on task-level instructions and overlooked the variations within case-level inputs. Moreover, the models used in these studies are trained and evaluated on traditional NLP datasets, while today’s LLMs are predominantly instruction-tuned on and serve diverse user prompts. This
