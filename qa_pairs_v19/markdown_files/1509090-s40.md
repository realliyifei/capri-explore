## I don't know?: False

The identification and filtering of multi-word expression (MWE) candidates in multilingual discovery using parallel corpora typically involves several steps that leverage the structure and data within the corpora. Passage 5 provides insights into this process, noting that a sizeable collection of bilingual MWE pairs can be extracted from root parallel corpora, specifically mentioning collections of 3,159,226 bilingual MWE pairs for German-English and 143,042 for Chinese-English after filtering [5]. This extraction process is crucial as it underpins the ability to analyze MWEs across different language pairs.

To accurately identify MWE candidates, researchers often employ techniques such as MWE detection and decomposition. MWE detection assesses text for sequences of words that function as single units, regardless of the number of words involved. This step is essential because MWEs, like idioms or compound expressions, often do not adhere to standard grammatical rules and can exist across multiple languages [1] [4]. 

The filtering stage involves evaluating and refining the extracted MWE candidates to ensure they meet certain linguistic and contextual criteria. This can include removing candidates that do not have clear translations or those that fail to demonstrate consistent usage across the corpora [5]. The passage indicates that the results of this filtering process are then assessed through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, which include examining the translation performance when applying MWEs in machine translation (MT) contexts [5]. 

In practical terms, once MWEs are detected and filtered, the quality of these MWEs can be validated through MT experiments. The experiments demonstrate improved translation performances on MWE terms, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing MT systems [5]. This validation process is critical, as it provides empirical support for the relevance and utility of the identified MWEs in real-world applications. 

Ultimately, parallel corpora serve as a rich resource for discovering MWEs because they provide contextualized examples of how these expressions function across languages. The methods used in the identification and filtering process are central to ensuring that the MWEs extracted are both accurate and applicable in multilingual settings [1] [2] [3]. 

In summary, the process of identifying and filtering MWE candidates in the context of multilingual discovery involves the extraction of potential MWEs from parallel corpora, followed by rigorous detection, decomposition, and quality assessment through experimental validation. These methods ensure that researchers can effectively utilize MWEs in various NLP applications, particularly in machine translation tasks.

Our collections are 3,159,226 and 143,042 bilingual MWE pairs for German-English and Chinese-English respectively after filtering. We examine the quality of these extracted bilingual MWEs in MT experiments. Our initial experiments applying MWEs in MT show improved translation performances on MWE terms in qualitative analysis and better general evaluation scores in quantitative analysis, on both German-English and Chinese-English language pairs. We follow a standard experimental pipeline to create our MultiMWE corpora which are available online. Researchers can use this free corpus for their own models or use them in a knowledge base as model features.
