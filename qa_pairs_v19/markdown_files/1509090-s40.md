## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The process of identifying and filtering multi-word expression (MWE) candidates in multilingual discovery using parallel corpora involves several key steps, as outlined in the context provided.

First, parallel corpora serve as a foundation for extracting bilingual MWEs. The authors mention that they have collected a substantial number of bilingual MWE pairs from root parallel corpora, specifically 3,159,226 pairs for German-English and 143,042 pairs for Chinese-English after filtering [5]. This implies that the initial corpus consists of sentences or phrases available in two languages, which can reveal potential MWEs across languages based on their co-occurrence.

Identifying MWE candidates typically involves techniques for MWE detection, which is a significant area of research in natural language processing (NLP) [1][2][3][4]. These techniques may analyze frequency patterns, collocations, and syntactic structures within the parallel corpora to determine which combinations of words are often used together and might represent a single semantic unit.

Filtering these candidates is crucial to enhancing the quality of the extracted MWEs. The authors indicate that they conduct examinations on the quality of the extracted bilingual MWEs through machine translation (MT) experiments. This suggests that they evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of the MWEs by applying them in practical MT scenarios and assessing their performance [5]. The experimental pipeline involves a series of standardized steps that help in validating the relevance and applicability of the MWEs in translation tasks.

In addition, the results from initial experiments indicate improvements in translation performances, particularly on MWE terms, showing that a robust method for filtering and validating these expressions can lead to enhanced MT outcomes [5]. The ability to show better general evaluation scores in quantitative analysis further supports the claim that systematic approaches to identify and filter MWEs are effective in multilingual environments.

To summarize, methods utilizing parallel corpora to identify and filter MWEs involve extracting bilingual MWE candidates through MWE detection techniques focused on frequency and linguistic features, followed by rigorous quality assessment in MT experiments that validate the practical utility of these expressions in translation scenarios. This two-step approach ensures that the MWEs that are selected for further use are both contextually relevant and linguistically accurate, benefiting ongoing research and practical applications in the field of NLP.

Our collections are 3,159,226 and 143,042 bilingual MWE pairs for German-English and Chinese-English respectively after filtering. We examine the quality of these extracted bilingual MWEs in MT experiments. Our initial experiments applying MWEs in MT show improved translation performances on MWE terms in qualitative analysis and better general evaluation scores in quantitative analysis, on both German-English and Chinese-English language pairs. We follow a standard experimental pipeline to create our MultiMWE corpora which are available online. Researchers can use this free corpus for their own models or use them in a knowledge base as model features.
