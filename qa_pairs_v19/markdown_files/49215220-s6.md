## Answer

## I don't know?: False

Evaluating Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) systems presents several significant challenges that complicate the comparison of different systems. These challenges stem primarily from the nature of OpenIE itself and the diversity of data sources from which information is extracted.

1. **Annotation Specification Difficulties**: One of the core challenges in evaluating OpenIE systems is that determining annotation specifications is inherently difficult. Unlike closed Information Extraction (IE) systems that operate within predefined ontological frameworks, OpenIE systems have far fewer restrictions on the types of facts that can be extracted. This flexibility leads to variability in expectations among different annotators, which in turn affects the consistency and reliability of evaluations [1].

2. **Variability in Language Phenomena**: OpenIE deals with free-form extractions from unstructured data, which means that language phenomena can vary significantly across different domains and contexts. This variability complicates the annotation process, as different language patterns may lead to different extraction outputs for the same semantic relationships. As a result, annotators might expect different extractions, creating discrepancies that hinder effective evaluation [1].

3. **Lack of Standardized Benchmarks**: There is currently a lack of benchmarks covering diverse domains for OpenIE systems. Most existing benchmarks focus on more structured domains like news or encyclopedic content, leaving a gap in understanding how OpenIE systems perform on informal user-generated content such as social media (e.g., tweets) or specialized domains like medical or scientific texts. The performance of OpenIE systems across these varied contexts is largely unknown, making it challenging to compare systems reliably [3].

4. **Complexity of Extractions**: The extractions generated by OpenIE can be complex due to the possibility of multiple predicates corresponding to the same semantic relationship, as well as arguments that refer to the same entity. This complexity necessitates careful evaluation criteria, as different systems may produce varied extraction outputs for the same input sentence. Such subtleties can obscure straightforward comparisons between systems [3].

5. **Emerging Data Sources**: OpenIE is increasingly applied to rich data sources like social media, which introduce additional variability due to their noise, informality, and brevity. Evaluating systems on this type of data requires new methodologies and frameworks that take into account the intrinsic challenges of these data formats [2].

6. **High Stakes for Performance Assessment**: As OpenIE systems are critical for many high-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, inaccuracies in extraction can severely impact the downstream applications such as question answering, machine translation, and knowledge representation. Failing to establish reliable evaluation standards can lead to poor performance assessments, which may falsely represent the capabilities of various systems [5].

In conclusion, the main challenges in evaluating OpenIE systems revolve around difficulties in annotation, variability in data and language, lack of benchmarks, complexity of extractions, and the unique characteristics of emerging data sources. These challenges collectively undermine the ability to make reliable comparisons among different OpenIE systems, highlighting the need for more standardized evaluation methodologies and diverse benchmarks.

[1]: Passage ID 1: To the best of our knowledge, there is no study systematically comparing neural and rule-based OpenIE systems. Note that, accuracy of current neural OpenIE systems may be limited by the low quality training data bootstrapped from rule-based systems.4 Challenges and Future DirectionsOpenIE is a challenging problem due to the free form of extractions.Neural OpenIE systems learn high-level features automatically from training data. This new paradigm imposes new challenges and also opens up new research opportunities.In this section, we discuss the open issues in OpenIE and set up the directions for future research.4.1 ChallengesEvaluation.Determining annotation specifications is difficult for OpenIE.Compared to closed IE which relies on predefined ontology schema in predictable domains, OpenIE imposes very few restrictions on their extractions. Thus different annotators may expect different facts to be extracted.Due to various language phenomena in open domain, it is
[2]: Passage ID 2: etc.•Social Analysis: Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and blogs are acting as new style of sharing and exchanging information. Extracting information from social media poses various challenges as text is noisy, quite informal, and short in context. To make use of this vast information, we need better IE tools which meet the listed challenges. Social media analysis has gained lot of attention in IE research community as it provides up-to-date information compared to conventional sources such as news.7 Current challenges and future research7.1 Open Information Extraction (OpenIE)OpenIE have been drawing more and more attention from research community to enhance and scale IE systems by utilizing large, complex and heterogenous data; and extracting all meaningful relations and events without any restrictions. Current challenges includes extending the capability of OpenIE to handle n-ary relations and even nested extractions, dealing with
[3]: Passage ID 3: of traditional OpenIE systems on science, medical and general audience corpus. They find that systems perform much worse on science or medical corpus. Performance of neural OpenIE systems in domains other than news or encyclopedia is unknown, due to the lack of such benchmarks. It is also unknown how OpenIE systems perform on informal user-generated contents like tweets. Hence benchmarks covering more domains are necessary. It is also questionable whether an ominous OpenIE system that performs well on corpus in any domain is achievable. Word and grammatical patterns may vary largely in different domains.Application.Compared to closed IE, the extractions from OpenIE are more difficult to use. There is possibility of multiple predicates referring to the same semantic relation, or arguments referring to the same entity. For example, we consider two extractions (Einstein; was born in; Ulm), (Ulm; is the birthplace of; Einstein). These tuples are extracted from two sentences which
[4]: Passage ID 4: Insight Mining with LLMsOur work is difficult to subsume under a single research area.In this section, we discuss how our real-world task relates to other canonical tasksand how OpenAI’s LLMs have performed in some of these tasks.Information extraction (IE) is the task of identifying structured information – such as entities, events, and their relationships – from unstructured data (Mausam, 2016).Researchers have developed many systems for open information extraction (Open-IE) over the years (e.g., (Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013; Mausam et al., 2012; Banko et al., 2007)).OpenAI’s ChatGPT performs remarkably well in open-IE tasks, despite certain shortcomings including its tendency to be overconfident (Li et al., 2023a).The high performance of ChatGPT is not surprising given that ChatGPT has demonstrated good performance in many zero-shot natural language tasks (Qin et al., 2023).Compared to our approach, the IE task differs in that the output of our approach is unstructured

Various sub-tasks of IE such as Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, Relation Extraction, Knowledge Base reasoning forms the building blocks of various high end Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Machine Translation, Question-Answering System, Natural Language Understanding, Text Summarization and Digital Assistants like Siri, Cortana and Google Now. This paper introduces Information Extraction technology, its various sub-tasks, highlights state-of-the-art research in various IE subtasks, current challenges and future research directions.1 Introduction to Information ExtractionData is now a kind of capital, on par with financial and human capital in creating new digital products and services.
