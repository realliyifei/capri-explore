## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Evaluating Open Information Extraction (Open IE) systems presents several significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of the task and the nature of the systems involved. 

One of the key challenges in evaluating Open IE is the difficulty in determining annotation specifications. In contrast to closed information extraction, which relies on predefined ontological schemas in predictable domains, Open IE allows for varied and free-form extractions. This flexibility results in different annotators possibly expecting different sets of facts to be extracted, leading to inconsistencies in evaluation criteria [1]. Moreover, due to the open nature of the domain, there are various language phenomena and linguistic variabilities that complicate the extraction process, making it challenging to establish uniform benchmarks for comparison [1][2].

Furthermore, the quality of training data significantly affects the evaluation of these systems. As noted, the accuracy of current neural Open IE systems is potentially limited by low-quality training datasets that are largely derived from rule-based systems. This dependency raises concerns about the reliability of system evaluations since the foundational datasets may not adequately represent the complexities of real-world text [1]. Consequently, the performance of Open IE systems can vary drastically across different types of text, such as scientific or medical literature compared to general news or encyclopedic text. Existing evaluations indicate that systems typically perform worse in specialized domains, which indicates a lack of comprehensive benchmarks across various domains [2].

Another noteworthy issue is the application of extracted tuples. In Open IE, multiple predicates can refer to the same semantic relation, complicating the interpretation and utility of the extracted data. This complexity makes it difficult to establish meaningful comparisons between systems, as discrepancies may arise not just from the systems’ algorithms but also from the inherent ambiguity in the data they process [2]. 

In summary, the challenges in evaluating Open IE systems primarily stem from the variability in annotation standards, quality and type of training data, and the open-ended nature of the extraction tasks that these systems perform. These challenges significantly hinder the ability to conduct fair and straightforward comparisons among different Open IE systems, as they introduce a level of subjectivity and complexity that is difficult to standardize across diverse use cases and training environments [1][2].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: To the best of our knowledge, there is no study systematically comparing neural and rule-based OpenIE systems. Note that, accuracy of current neural OpenIE systems may be limited by the low quality training data bootstrapped from rule-based systems.4 Challenges and Future DirectionsOpenIE is a challenging problem due to the free form of extractions.Neural OpenIE systems learn high-level features automatically from training data. This new paradigm imposes new challenges and also opens up new research opportunities.In this section, we discuss the open issues in OpenIE and set up the directions for future research.4.1 ChallengesEvaluation.Determining annotation specifications is difficult for OpenIE.Compared to closed IE which relies on predefined ontology schema in predictable domains, OpenIE imposes very few restrictions on their extractions. Thus different annotators may expect different facts to be extracted.Due to various language phenomena in open domain, it is
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: of traditional OpenIE systems on science, medical and general audience corpus. They find that systems perform much worse on science or medical corpus. Performance of neural OpenIE systems in domains other than news or encyclopedia is unknown, due to the lack of such benchmarks. It is also unknown how OpenIE systems perform on informal user-generated contents like tweets. Hence benchmarks covering more domains are necessary. It is also questionable whether an ominous OpenIE system that performs well on corpus in any domain is achievable. Word and grammatical patterns may vary largely in different domains.Application.Compared to closed IE, the extractions from OpenIE are more difficult to use. There is possibility of multiple predicates referring to the same semantic relation, or arguments referring to the same entity. For example, we consider two extractions (Einstein; was born in; Ulm), (Ulm; is the birthplace of; Einstein). These tuples are extracted from two sentences which

This underlines its capability in resource-constrained environments. Our research stands as a testament to the possibility of accomplishing efficient information extraction with reduced data and minimal training time, thereby presenting new pathways for future research within the OpenIE landscape.LimitationsFollowing an examination of the CARB test set and the output generated by existing OpenIE systems, we found that these systems struggle to effectively manage cases that involve extensive sentences with multiple triples.While OK-IE has the ability to enhance computational efficiency and the optimization of data resources, it does not sufficiently address the aforementioned issues. The generation-based strategy is capable of creating long, meticulously refined triple sequences, but there is still the possibility
