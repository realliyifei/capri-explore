## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Evaluating Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) systems presents significant challenges that stem from their inherent characteristics and the nature of the data they process. One of the primary challenges is the difficulty in determining annotation specifications. Unlike closed Information Extraction (IE), which relies on predefined ontology schemas in predictable domains, OpenIE has minimal restrictions on the types of facts that can be extracted. This flexibility allows different annotators to have varying expectations regarding the extractions, leading to inconsistencies in evaluations [1] [2].

Additionally, the diversity of language phenomena present in open-domain text complicates the evaluation process. Since OpenIE systems are designed to extract information from a wide range of unstructured data sources—including informal and often noisy content from social media—the varying syntax, grammar, and semantics can further skew results and impair uniform comparisons across different systems [1] [3]. For instance, the performance of OpenIE systems can vary greatly depending on the domain, such as science or medical contexts, which have been found to present additional difficulties compared to more standardized content like news articles [3]. There is also a concern regarding the ability of OpenIE systems to handle complex relationships, such as n-ary relations and nested extractions, that are less common in traditional data [2].

Moreover, the current frameworks and benchmarks for assessing the performance of OpenIE systems are limited. For example, while neural OpenIE systems might be performing well on certain datasets, their performance on informal, user-generated content (like tweets) is largely unknown due to the absence of comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate this domain [3]. This lack of benchmarks limits the ability to draw meaningful comparisons between systems, as performance metrics may not be aligned or standardized across systems that operate under different contexts or requirements.

The situation is further complicated by the diverse outputs that OpenIE systems can produce. Extracting information can yield multiple predicates for the same semantic relation or different arguments that refer to the same entity, making it challenging to maintain clarity in comparative evaluations [3]. For example, the extraction of information regarding the same fact might result in several tuple formations, leading to ambiguity in assessing which system provides the most accurate or useful information.

In summary, the main challenges in evaluating OpenIE systems include the lack of standardization in annotation and specification, the variability in language phenomena across different contexts, the limitations of existing benchmarks, and the complexity of the outputs generated by these systems. These challenges collectively hinder the ability to conduct fair and effective comparisons between different OpenIE systems, impeding advancements in the field [1] [2] [3].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: To the best of our knowledge, there is no study systematically comparing neural and rule-based OpenIE systems. Note that, accuracy of current neural OpenIE systems may be limited by the low quality training data bootstrapped from rule-based systems.4 Challenges and Future DirectionsOpenIE is a challenging problem due to the free form of extractions.Neural OpenIE systems learn high-level features automatically from training data. This new paradigm imposes new challenges and also opens up new research opportunities.In this section, we discuss the open issues in OpenIE and set up the directions for future research.4.1 ChallengesEvaluation.Determining annotation specifications is difficult for OpenIE.Compared to closed IE which relies on predefined ontology schema in predictable domains, OpenIE imposes very few restrictions on their extractions. Thus different annotators may expect different facts to be extracted.Due to various language phenomena in open domain, it is
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: etc.•Social Analysis: Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and blogs are acting as new style of sharing and exchanging information. Extracting information from social media poses various challenges as text is noisy, quite informal, and short in context. To make use of this vast information, we need better IE tools which meet the listed challenges. Social media analysis has gained lot of attention in IE research community as it provides up-to-date information compared to conventional sources such as news.7 Current challenges and future research7.1 Open Information Extraction (OpenIE)OpenIE have been drawing more and more attention from research community to enhance and scale IE systems by utilizing large, complex and heterogenous data; and extracting all meaningful relations and events without any restrictions. Current challenges includes extending the capability of OpenIE to handle n-ary relations and even nested extractions, dealing with
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: of traditional OpenIE systems on science, medical and general audience corpus. They find that systems perform much worse on science or medical corpus. Performance of neural OpenIE systems in domains other than news or encyclopedia is unknown, due to the lack of such benchmarks. It is also unknown how OpenIE systems perform on informal user-generated contents like tweets. Hence benchmarks covering more domains are necessary. It is also questionable whether an ominous OpenIE system that performs well on corpus in any domain is achievable. Word and grammatical patterns may vary largely in different domains.Application.Compared to closed IE, the extractions from OpenIE are more difficult to use. There is possibility of multiple predicates referring to the same semantic relation, or arguments referring to the same entity. For example, we consider two extractions (Einstein; was born in; Ulm), (Ulm; is the birthplace of; Einstein). These tuples are extracted from two sentences which
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Insight Mining with LLMsOur work is difficult to subsume under a single research area.In this section, we discuss how our real-world task relates to other canonical tasksand how OpenAI’s LLMs have performed in some of these tasks.Information extraction (IE) is the task of identifying structured information – such as entities, events, and their relationships – from unstructured data (Mausam, 2016).Researchers have developed many systems for open information extraction (Open-IE) over the years (e.g., (Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013; Mausam et al., 2012; Banko et al., 2007)).OpenAI’s ChatGPT performs remarkably well in open-IE tasks, despite certain shortcomings including its tendency to be overconfident (Li et al., 2023a).The high performance of ChatGPT is not surprising given that ChatGPT has demonstrated good performance in many zero-shot natural language tasks (Qin et al., 2023).Compared to our approach, the IE task differs in that the output of our approach is unstructured

Various sub-tasks of IE such as Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, Relation Extraction, Knowledge Base reasoning forms the building blocks of various high end Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Machine Translation, Question-Answering System, Natural Language Understanding, Text Summarization and Digital Assistants like Siri, Cortana and Google Now. This paper introduces Information Extraction technology, its various sub-tasks, highlights state-of-the-art research in various IE subtasks, current challenges and future research directions.1 Introduction to Information ExtractionData is now a kind of capital, on par with financial and human capital in creating new digital products and services.
