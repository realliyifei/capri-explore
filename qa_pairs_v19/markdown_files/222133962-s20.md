## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Models can leverage the similarities between different languages to enhance unsupervised multilingual dependency parsing in several ways, primarily by exploiting shared syntactic behaviors and utilizing cross-linguistic knowledge. 

First, simultaneous learning across multiple languages allows models to identify and exploit shared syntactic behaviors, particularly among languages within the same family. For instance, research has indicated that jointly learning dependency parsers for related languages can significantly improve model performance by capturing these commonalities [2]. This approach enables the models to generalize findings from one language to another, thereby increasing overall parsing accuracy.

Second, techniques have been developed that guide the learning process of an unsupervised dependency parser by leveraging information from another language. For example, some models apply regularization methods to align different aspects of the parsers, such as model parameters, dependency edge scores, and parse trees, encouraging similarity across languages. Such cross-model regularization promotes a transfer of syntactic knowledge, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with languages that have limited labeled data [2].

Moreover, models trained on related languages can boost evaluation scores of systems designed for syntactic prediction tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing [3]. By using training data from multiple languages, models can enhance their understanding of linguistic structures, taking advantage of the vast, often underutilized, pool of unlabeled text available for training. This is important because many traditional unsupervised parsing methods have struggled with the lack of sufficient training data, especially for languages that are distantly related [3][5].

Additionally, multilingual frameworks can reduce training costs by providing a unified model that accommodates various languages, which circumvents the inefficiencies of creating separate models for each language. This consolidation becomes particularly relevant given modern advancements in language model pretraining, which demonstrates the ability to leverage larger supplies of unsupervised text to improve parsing accuracy across languages [3].

In summary, enhancing unsupervised multilingual dependency parsing hinges on the capacity to recognize and utilize the structural similarities between languages, apply cross-linguistic knowledge through model regularization, and capitalize on vast unlabeled corpora. As suggested in current research, there remains significant potential for developing robust unsupervised parsers that can not only perform effectively on individual languages but also generalize across different linguistic contexts [4].

Pretrained language models leverage a large-scale corpus for pretraining and then small data sets of specific tasks for finetuning, reducing the difficulty of downstream tasks and boosting their performance. Current state-of-the-art approaches on supervised dependency parsing, such as ?), adopt the new paradigm and benefit from pretrained language modeling.However, pretrained language models have not been widely used in unsupervised dependency parsing.One major concern is that pretrained language models are too informative and may make unsupervised models more prone to overfitting. Besides, massive syntactic and semantic information is

Ideally, these models can learn from each other by identifying shared syntactic behaviors of different languages, especially those in the same language family. For example, ?) propose to utilize the similarity of different languages defined by a phylogenetic tree and learn several dependency parsers jointly. ?) propose to learn a unified multilingual parser with language embeddings as input. ?) propose to guide the learning process of unsupervised dependency parser from the knowledge of another language by using three types of regularization to encourage similarity between model parameters, dependency edge scores, and parse trees respectively.Methods≤10absent10\leq 10AllGenerative Approaches (cont’d)Generative

(2017); Smith et al. (2018).However, scaling to a higher number of languages can often be problematic.Without an ample supply of training data for the considered languages, it can be difficult to form appropriate generalizations and especially difficult if those languages are distant from each other.But recent techniques in language model pretraining can profit from a drastically larger supply of unsupervised text, demonstrating the capability of transferring contextual sentence-level knowledge to boost the parsing accuracy of existing NLP models Howard and Ruder (2018); Peters et al.

We first motivate the importance of the unsupervised dependency parsing task and discuss several related research areas. We split existing approaches into two main categories, and explain each category in detail. Besides, we discuss several recent trends in this research area.While there is a growing body of work that improves unsupervised dependency parsing, its performance is still below that of supervised dependency parsing by a large margin. This suggests that more investigation and research are needed to make unsupervised parsers useful for real applications. We hope that our survey can promote further development in this research
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: parsing does not require syntactically annotated training corpora and can theoretically use almost unlimited raw texts for training, most of the previous work conducts experiments on the WSJ10 corpus (the Wall Street Journal corpus with sentences no longer than 10 words) containing no more than 6,000 training sentences. There are a few papers that try to go beyond such a small training corpus. ?) use two large corpora containing more than 700k sentences. ?) utilize a very large corpus based on Wikipedia in learning an unlexicalized dependency grammar. ?) use a subset of the BLLIP corpus that contains around 180k sentences. With the advancement of computing power and deep neural models, we expect to see more future work on training with big data.4.5 Unsupervised Multilingual ParsingTo tackle the lack of supervision in unsupervised dependency parsing, some previous work considers learning models of multiple languages simultaneously [Berg-Kirkpatrick andKlein, 2010, Liu et al.,
