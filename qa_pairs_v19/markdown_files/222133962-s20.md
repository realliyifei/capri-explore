## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Models can enhance unsupervised multilingual dependency parsing by leveraging the similarities between different languages through a variety of approaches. One effective strategy is to learn models of multiple languages simultaneously. This allows models to identify shared syntactic behaviors among languages, particularly those within the same language family [2]. By recognizing these similarities, a model can improve its understanding and prediction of dependency structures, as some syntactic traits may be consistent across languages.

For example, certain methods propose utilizing the similarity of different languages as defined by a phylogenetic tree. This enables the joint learning of multiple dependency parsers, which can share latent knowledge during training [2]. Additionally, unified multilingual parsers can be developed that take language embeddings as input, allowing for a more holistic approach to parsing that incorporates information from multiple languages in a cohesive manner [2].

Furthermore, regularization techniques can be used to guide the learning process of an unsupervised dependency parser by leveraging knowledge from another language. This can be accomplished through regularization that encourages similarity between model parameters, dependency edge scores, and parse trees across different languages [2]. Such techniques help ensure that the model does not operate in isolation but rather benefits from the learned representations and syntactic patterns of related languages.

In addition, utilizing syntactic information from the training data of similar languages can significantly boost the performance of models predicting syntactic elements such as part-of-speech tags and dependency trees [4]. Multilinguality not only enhances evaluation performance but also reduces the complexity and cost associated with training multiple models for different languages [4]. 

Moreover, recent advancements in language model pretraining using larger supplies of unsupervised text have demonstrated the ability to transfer contextual knowledge. This transfer can improve parsing accuracy and overall NLP model performance, even when languages exhibit distance from each other [4]. Such strategies underscore the importance of cross-linguistic information sharing in developing effective unsupervised multilingual models.

In conclusion, unsupervised multilingual dependency parsing can be significantly enhanced through the simultaneous learning of languages, the use of regularization methods, and capitalizing on shared syntactic characteristics within related languages. By incorporating these methods, NLP models can leverage multilingual data effectively to improve their parsing capabilities across various languages.

Pretrained language models leverage a large-scale corpus for pretraining and then small data sets of specific tasks for finetuning, reducing the difficulty of downstream tasks and boosting their performance. Current state-of-the-art approaches on supervised dependency parsing, such as ?), adopt the new paradigm and benefit from pretrained language modeling.However, pretrained language models have not been widely used in unsupervised dependency parsing.One major concern is that pretrained language models are too informative and may make unsupervised models more prone to overfitting. Besides, massive syntactic and semantic information is

[2]:  Passage ID 2: tackle the lack of supervision in unsupervised dependency parsing, some previous work considers learning models of multiple languages simultaneously [Berg-Kirkpatrick andKlein, 2010, Liu et al., 2013, Jiang et al., 2019, Han et al., 2019b]. Ideally, these models can learn from each other by identifying shared syntactic behaviors of different languages, especially those in the same language family. For example, ?) propose to utilize the similarity of different languages defined by a phylogenetic tree and learn several dependency parsers jointly. ?) propose to learn a unified multilingual parser with language embeddings as input. ?) propose to guide the learning process of unsupervised dependency parser from the knowledge of another language by using three types of regularization to encourage similarity between model parameters, dependency edge scores, and parse trees respectively.Methods≤10absent10\leq 10AllGenerative Approaches (cont’d)Generative

Using prediction, such programs are able to generate more relevant, human-sounding sentences. III-A1 Neural Language ModelingA problem with statistical language models was the inability to deal well with synonyms or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) wordsthat were not present in the training corpus.Progress was made in solving the problems with the introduction of the neural language model [49]. While much of NLP took another decade to begin to use ANNs heavily, the LM community immediately took advantage of them, and continued to develop sophisticated models, many of which were summarized by DeMulder et al. [50].III-A2 Evaluation of Language ModelsWhile neural networks have made breakthroughs in the LM field, it is hard to quantify improvements.It is desirable to evaluate language models independently of

[4]:  Passage ID 4: the training data of similar languages can boost evaluation scores of models predicting syntactic information like part-of-speech and dependency trees.Multilinguality not only can improve a model’s evaluation performance, but can also reduce the cost of training multiple models for a collection of languages Johnson et al. (2017); Smith et al. (2018).However, scaling to a higher number of languages can often be problematic.Without an ample supply of training data for the considered languages, it can be difficult to form appropriate generalizations and especially difficult if those languages are distant from each other.But recent techniques in language model pretraining can profit from a drastically larger supply of unsupervised text, demonstrating the capability of transferring contextual sentence-level knowledge to boost the parsing accuracy of existing NLP models Howard and Ruder (2018); Peters et al.

[5]:  Passage ID 5: admittedly extremely broad area and covers most work in the field of distributional semantics including topic models (Blei et al., 2003), word, sentence, and paragraph vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013; Kiros et al., 2015; Le & Mikolov, 2014), and language models (Bengio et al., 2003). It also includes much of the broader field of NLP that deals with predicting or modeling sequences of natural language in some way. Work in NLP intentionally leveraging natural language supervision in the form of explanations, feedback, instructions, and advice for tasks such as classification (as opposed to the commonly used representation of supervision as a set of arbitrarily encoded discrete category labels) has been explored in many creative and advanced ways. Dialog based learning (Weston, 2016; Li et al., 2016; Hancock et al., 2019) develops techniques to learn from interactive natural language feedback in dialog. Several papers have leveraged semantic parsing to convert natural language explanations
