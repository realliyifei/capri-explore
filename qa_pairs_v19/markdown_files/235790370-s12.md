## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information specifically about procedurally generated environments or their role in simulations and generalization capabilities. The discussed topics focus on natural language processing (NLP), educational applications of NLP, the use of large language models (LLMs), and their effectiveness compared to traditional models, but there is no mention of simulation environments, whether procedurally generated or statically initialized, which is necessary to answer your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: exploration. Importantly, a long-standing goal in education is to personalize materials and assessments to the needs of individual students, and NLP has the potential to contribute towards that goal.Research Directions. 1.Controllable text generation. Dialog systems and more generally text generation have been previously used in education applications. Within this space, controllable text generation can be used for a more personalized experience, for instance to introduce students to new terms using automatically generated stories related to their interests or to modify stories to be accessible to grade school students with different reading levels. Similarly, while we have seen extensive work in reading comprehension, we can now start to imagine applications where the comprehension of a text will be tested based on a student’s prior experience, as well as previous tests that they have been exposed to, for a more adaptable learning experience.2.Educational explanation
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the laws of thermodynamics?” Following a quality inspection of the synthetically produced questions, we assembled a training dataset of 1601 examples, consisting of 120 questions for each of the 12 topics and 161 general questions. We also derived a test dataset containing 364 examples with a balanced class distribution similar to the training dataset.In our experiments, we evaluated three classification approaches: vector similarity search, prompting a LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), and few-shot fine-tuning of a transformer model with the SetFit framework Tunstall et al. (2022). Concerning the vector search approach with the SPECTER2 model, we measured the cosine similarity to compare vectors of embedded user queries with paper embeddings in our vector database to retrieve the 100 most similar
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: syntax, grammar, decision making, and reasoning from insufficient amounts of task-specific dataset. The recently introduced pre-trained language models have the potential to address the issue of data scarcity and bring considerable advantages by generating contextualized word embeddings. These models are considered counterpart of ImageNet in NLP and have demonstrated to capture different facets of language such as hierarchical relations, long-term dependency, and sentiment. In this short survey paper, we discuss the recent progress made in the field of pre-trained language models. We also deliberate that how the strengths of these language models can be leveraged in designing more engaging and more eloquent conversational agents. This paper, therefore, intends to establish whether these pre-trained models can overcome the challenges pertinent to dialogue systems, and how their architecture could be exploited in order to overcome these challenges. Open challenges in the field of
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: instances [1, 3]. LLMs leverage in-context learning (ICL), a new learning paradigm which doesn’t require task-specific fine-tuning and a large number of labelled instances [4]. LLMs treat any NLP task as a conditional text generation problem and generate the desired text output just by conditioning on the input prompt, which includes task description, test input and optionally, a few examples. Figure 1 shows the evolution of artificial intelligence from machine learning to large language models.In the beginning, NLP systems are predominantly rule-based. These rule-based models are built on top of domain expert-framed rules. As manual rule framing is a laborious, expensive process and also requires frequent changes, rules-based models are gradually replaced by machine models, which learn the rules automatically from the training data and completely avoid manual rule framing [1]. However, machine learning models require human intervention in the form of domain experts for feature
