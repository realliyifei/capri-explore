## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The use of transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has significantly enhanced stance detection performance across various languages by leveraging the extensive capabilities of large pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT, and their capacity for fine-tuning on specific tasks.

Initially, early works on stance detection relied on rule-based and traditional machine learning approaches, but since 2014, deep learning models became mainstream in this area. With the advent of BERT, a new paradigm emerged, emphasizing the pre-train and fine-tune process which allows models to learn general features and knowledge from vast amounts of training data [1]. This methodology results in exceptional performance across many NLP tasks, including stance detection, by effectively capturing the nuances and complexities of language [2].

Research has shown that pre-trained Neural Language Models (NLMs) can capture syntax and semantic phenomena, which are crucial for understanding stance [2]. The transfer learning framework allows models to first acquire broad linguistic knowledge during the pre-training phase, followed by a fine-tuning phase on specific targets, which can dramatically enhance their performance in stance detection [2]. For example, models can be adapted to recognize and classify stances using domain-specific datasets, refining their capabilities based on labeled data relevant to the topics at hand, which is particularly effective even when minimal data is available [4].

Further advancements include specific applications such as BertEmb, which utilizes BERT embeddings combined with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for stance detection and evidence retrieval. This approach effectively captures contextual information from complex, unstructured texts, such as news articles, thus enhancing the model's performance in nuanced scenarios [4] [5]. The reliance on extensive pre-existing knowledge embedded in these models allows them to generalize more effectively across various but related stance detection tasks, which is crucial in diverse linguistic contexts [4].

Moreover, additional linguistic information introduced during the pre-training phase has also been shown to further enhance the performance of these models [2]. This supports the notion that a well-rounded pre-training routine, along with targeted fine-tuning, is vital for achieving high accuracy in stance detection across multiple languages.

In summary, the integration of transfer learning and pre-trained Transformers has enabled more effective and nuanced stance detection performances by making use of massive datasets to learn general language features, followed by specialization through fine-tuning. This strategic approach allows for improvements in multilingual applications of stance detection, enhancing both the accuracy and applicability of models in varied linguistic scenarios [1] [2] [4].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: early works on stance detection focused on rule-based approaches, and later made a transition into traditional machine learning based algorithms. Since 2014, deep learning models quickly become the mainstream techniques for stance detection. Later on, with the great success of Google’s bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model, a new NLP research paradigm emerges which is utilizing large pre-trained language models (PLM) together with a fine tuning process. This pre-train and fine-tune paradigm provides exceptional performance for most NLP downstream tasks including stance detection, because the abundance of training data enables PLMs to learn enough general purpose features and knowledge for modeling different languages. Following BERT, more and more PLMs are proposed with different specialties and characteristics, including the ELMo series, the GPT series, the Turing series, varieties of BERT and many more.ChatGPT is the most recent PLM optimized for
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: (Belinkov and Glass, 2019) has been the focus of many studies in the recent NLP research. It has been extensively shown that pre-trained Neural Language Models (NLMs) are able to capture syntax- and semantic-sensitive phenomena (Hewitt and Manning, 2019; Pimentel et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022) and that there is a correlation between the degree of linguistic knowledge and its ability to solve correctly a downstream task (Miaschi et al., 2020; Sarti et al., 2021), although it is still highly debated (Ravichander et al., 2021). However, it has also been demonstrated that introducing additional linguistic information (Wang et al., 2019b; Zhou et al., 2020; Glavaš and Vulić, 2021) during the pre-training phase can enhance models’ performances. In addition, several works showed that transfer learning methods, such as fine-tuning on intermediate supporting tasks, are highly beneficial to improve pre-trained models’ performance in the resolution of multiple final target tasks (Phang et al.,
