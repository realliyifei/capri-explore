## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The use of transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has significantly enhanced stance detection performance across various languages by enabling models to leverage extensive pre-existing knowledge and to generalize effectively in multilingual contexts. Transfer learning allows stance detection models to be fine-tuned on specific domain-related datasets, which helps the models recognize and classify nuanced viewpoints even with minimal labeled data [2].

Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT and its multilingual variant mBERT are pivotal in this enhancement. These models can be adapted to perform stance detection by using embeddings to capture contextual information from complex texts, thus providing an effective means to analyze sentiment and viewpoints in social media posts and other documents [2] [3]. For instance, the mBERT model, pre-trained on 104 languages, performs well for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, allowing the stance detection model to operate effectively across different languages without needing extensive retraining in each one [5].

Moreover, the utilization of multilingual datasets augmented with translated training data enables models to recognize common patterns and sentiment expressions that are often consistent across languages [5]. By exposing models to diverse linguistic structures, grammatical differences, and cultural nuances, transfer learning promotes a better understanding of semantically equivalent expressions in varying languages, thus enhancing stance detection capabilities globally [5].

In addition, methods such as translation-augmented data and adversarial learning further improve the performance and robustness of stance detection models [3], showcasing the synergy between advanced model architecture and innovative training strategies. The effectiveness of these approaches is evident in extensive evaluations using large annotated datasets, which measure important metrics such as precision and recall and indicate substantial improvements in stance classification accuracy [2].

Overall, the combination of transfer learning and pre-trained Transformers has fostered significant advancements in stance detection, allowing for more nuanced, accurate, and contextually aware analyses of viewpoints expressed in multilingual settings [4]. This progressive direction in NLP research continues to unlock new possibilities for understanding public sentiment and facilitating policy analysis, particularly as the landscape of social media and online discourse evolves [1].

This approach leverages the extensive pre-existing knowledge in these models, refining them to recognize and classify stances by using labeled data related to the target topics. It is particularly effective in scenarios where the model must generalize across different but related targets by fine-tuning with minimal data.BertEmb uses BERT embeddings with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for stance detection (SD) and evidence retrieval (ER), effectively capturing contextual information from complex, unstructured texts like news articles. It highlights the power of transfer learning and pre-trained models for nuanced stance detection, especially in news reports, addressing gaps left by previous research focused mainly on user-generated content. The model is tested on the STANDER dataset, containing 3,291 expert-annotated news articles about US healthcare mergers. It is evaluated with macro-averaged precision, recall,

Techniques such as explainable AI (XAI) and transparent reasoning frameworks could be integrated to offer more detailed explanations of model predictions. This would not only improve user trust and understanding but also facilitate more effective model debugging and refinement. Combining these advances with improved knowledge integration strategies could significantly enhance the performance and applicability of stance detection models across diverse and evolving scenarios.Where large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in natural language processing (Zubiaga, 2024), their use for stance detection is still in its infancy (Lan et al., 2024).
