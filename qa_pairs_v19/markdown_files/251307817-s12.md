1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: as work to date has primarily focused on English or other high-resource languages Mondal et al. (2022) but devoted less efforts towards minority languages. Additionally, the lack of human evaluation of NLP-based health systems has made it challenging to measure their effectiveness in the real world. Current automatic evaluation metrics do not necessarily speak to patient outcomes. Hence, human-centric studies must be conducted in evaluating the efficacy of NLP-powered tools in healthcare.Research Directions.1.Healthcare benchmark construction. Although the documentation of recent LLMs reports very high performance for various medical question answering benchmarks, or medical licensing texts, there are many other tasks in healthcare that lack the data required to achieve similarly good performance. Access to medical datasets is often limited because of privacy issues, and therefore other approaches may be required to compile such benchmarks. Synthetic datasets are one such
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: Spoiler alert: there are many such research areas!About This Document.This document reflects the ideas about “the future of NLP research” from the members of an academic NLP research lab in the United States. The Language and Information Technologies (LIT) lab at the University of Michigan includes students at various stages in their degree, starting with students who are about to embark on a PhD, all the way to students who recently completed a PhD degree. The LIT students come from a wide variety of backgrounds, including China, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, South Korea, United States, and Uruguay, reflecting a very diverse set of beliefs, values, and lived experiences. Our research interests cover a wide range of NLP areas, including computational social science, causal reasoning, misinformation detection, healthcare conversation analysis, knowledge-aware generation, commonsense reasoning, cross-cultural models, multimodal question answering, non-verbal
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: exploration. Importantly, a long-standing goal in education is to personalize materials and assessments to the needs of individual students, and NLP has the potential to contribute towards that goal.Research Directions. 1.Controllable text generation. Dialog systems and more generally text generation have been previously used in education applications. Within this space, controllable text generation can be used for a more personalized experience, for instance to introduce students to new terms using automatically generated stories related to their interests or to modify stories to be accessible to grade school students with different reading levels. Similarly, while we have seen extensive work in reading comprehension, we can now start to imagine applications where the comprehension of a text will be tested based on a student’s prior experience, as well as previous tests that they have been exposed to, for a more adaptable learning experience.2.Educational explanation
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: the field, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, challenges remain in attaining human-like reasoning and generalization abilities, driving continued research for more sophisticated and robust NLP models.Gaps.Although LLMs have shown impressive performance on many reasoning benchmarks Brown et al. (2020b); Ouyang et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2022); Touvron et al. (2023a); OpenAI (2023), there are still several directions that remain challenging.They struggle to robustly manage formal reasoning Jin et al. (2022b); Stolfo et al. (2023); Jin et al. (2023a), as we often see LLMs prone to errors that a formal or symbolic system would not make.Additionally, since most of their training interacts with a world of text, NLP models still lack grounding in real-world experiences when reasoning Ignat et al. (2021).Lastly, more fundamental questions remain to be answered, such as distinguishing empirical knowledge and rational reasoning, and unveiling how LLMs
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: a lack of trust from the users. A promising solution is to provide reliable sources for the facts output by a model, by attaching references and showing any additional reasoning steps. For example, citations can be included along with its bibliography, or pointers to documents in the training data (or a document database) can be attached to the output. Such a system should evaluate the extent to which these sources back up the claims made by the model.12 Efficient NLPBackground.Efficient NLP is a research direction aiming to optimize the use of resources for NLP models. This objective arises from theneed to address the challenges posed by the increasing scale of language models and their growing resource consumption present new challenges for NLP advances (Touvron et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2023).Indeed, it is widely acknowledged that scaling up is an essential approach for achieving state-of-the-art performance on NLP tasks, especially those skills emerged with the
