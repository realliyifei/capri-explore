## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information regarding the strategies employed to mitigate noise issues in distant supervision for relation extraction within the field of natural language processing (NLP). The passages focus on the generation of synthetic datasets for question-answering systems and an overview of NLP's relevance in AI, but they do not address specific methodologies related to relation extraction or distant supervision. As a result, the context is insufficient to answer your question fully.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
