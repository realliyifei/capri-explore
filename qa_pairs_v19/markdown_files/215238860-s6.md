## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information regarding strategies that are currently employed to mitigate the noise issue in distant supervision for relation extraction. The passages focus primarily on topics related to natural language processing (NLP), dialogue systems, and question answering (QA) systems but do not explicitly address noise mitigation strategies in distant supervision or relation extraction. Therefore, the available information is insufficient to respond accurately to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: and controllable responses. However, a large candidate set could be computationally costly. We propose methods that support a fast and accurate response retrieval system. To boost accuracy, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach where a very strong yet computationally expensive joint encoding model is used to facilitate training our encoders. We then boost the retrieval speed by adopting a learning-based candidate screening method to further reduce inference time. We demonstrate that our model performs strongly in terms of retrieval accuracy and speed trade-off.In summary, this thesis systematically demonstrates our effort on innovating dialogue systems. We believe that the research questions that we focus on are important aspects for ultimately improving automated dialogue agents to human-level. With our effort of innovating dialogue systems spanning the last 4 years, and state-of-the-art NLP models fast evolving year by year, we note that the models used in some of our works
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: retrieval corpora has achieved explosive growth [148] and models have been equipped with the ability to query the web for answering questions [149, 150].In the future, there may be different forms of retrieval to leverage different kinds of information such as common sense knowledge, factual relations, linguistic information, etc. Retrieval augmentation could also be combined with more structured forms of knowledge retrieval, such as methods from knowledge base population and open information extraction.More Generalized Methods for NLPNatural language is most different from image or sound in that its representation is discrete. At the same time, NLP includes specific tasks such as structured prediction that are not available in other modalities. Therefore, unlike general methods such as clipping for image augmentation or speed perturbation for audio augmentation, there is currently no DA method that can be effective for all NLP tasks. This means that there is still a gap for DA

The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence.
