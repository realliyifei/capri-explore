## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Word2Vec significantly improved upon traditional word representation methods like one-hot encoding by utilizing distributed word representations, which address several of the shortcomings experienced with earlier techniques.

One of the key limitations of one-hot encoding is the curse of dimensionality, especially with large vocabularies that can reach millions of words [1]. This method produces high-dimensional vectors where the representation fails to capture meaningful semantic relationships between words, as each word is represented by a unique index, resulting in equal distances between all words in the vector space [1]. In contrast, Word2Vec employs continuous word representations by assigning lower-dimensional vectors to words, typically a few hundred dimensions, which can capture semantic and syntactic properties more effectively [1][3]. This method enables the model to learn a rich representation of words based on context, enhancing the overall understanding of language.

Moreover, while traditional categorical representations, such as one-hot encoding, struggle with polysemy (the phenomenon where a single word can have multiple meanings), Word2Vec represents words in a way that allows for proximity in vector space to reflect semantic similarity [3]. By using algorithms like Skip-gram and Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW), Word2Vec can produce vectors based on contextual information, which helps it to better distinguish between different meanings of the same word based on surrounding words [3]. This feature allows Word2Vec to maintain the nuances of word meanings, unlike one-hot encoding, which treats all words as entirely distinct with no relational context.

Additionally, Word2Vec improves the handling of unseen words. While traditional methods can assign a random vector to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, this approach does not generalize effectively. In contrast, Word2Vec’s vector space allows for better interpolation of meanings, as the model leverages known word vectors to estimate the position of previously unseen words based on their contextual use [3]. This adaptability further enhances its utility in various NLP applications.

Overall, the transformation brought by Word2Vec in natural language processing encompasses significant advancements in representation learning. Its ability to generate dense word embeddings that account for context and relationships among words fundamentally shifts the landscape of NLP, enabling much more sophisticated analysis and processing of textual data [4]. The advancements that Word2Vec offers over previous methods have laid the groundwork for subsequent developments in language modeling and word embeddings, solidifying its status as a foundational tool in NLP [2][4].

One traditional approach is one-hot encoding, where a vector has a “1" at the index corresponding to the word and “0"s elsewhere. However, this approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality when dealing with large vocabulary sizes that can reach millions [2]. Additionally, one-hot encoding fails to capture syntactic or semantic properties because all word distances in the vector space are equal.Distributed word representations have been developed to overcome the limitations of one-hot encoding [8]. In this approach, words are represented by lower-dimensional vectors, typically a few hundred dimensions, where each element can take on various values [18]. These distributed word

In this survey, we explore different word representation models and its power of expression, from the classical to modern-day state-of-the-art word representation language models (LMS). We describe a variety of text representation methods, and model designs have blossomed in the context of NLP, including SOTA LMs. These models can transform large volumes of text into effective vector representations capturing the same semantic information. Further, such representations can be utilized by various machine learning (ML) algorithms for a variety of NLP related tasks. In the end, this survey briefly discusses the commonly used ML and DL based classifiers, evaluation metrics and the applications of these word embeddings in different NLP tasks.Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Word representation, Language
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: areas such as image detection, speech recognition, NLP etc. (LeCunet al., 2015). Continuous word representation models like Word2Vec , GloVe and FastText (Mikolov et al., 2013; Manning et al., 2014; Joulinet al., 2016; Bojanowski et al., 2016b) etc. have drastically improved the classification results and overcome shortcomings of categorical representations. It is found that having these continuous word representation of words is more affected as compared to traditional linguistic features because of their ability to capture more semantic and syntactic information of the textual data without losing much information. Despite their success, there are still some limitations which they are not capable of addressing such as they are unable to handle polysemy issues because they assign the same vector to word and ignores its context. Also, models like Word2Vec and GloVe assigns a random vector to a word which they did not encounter during training which means they are unable to handle out
