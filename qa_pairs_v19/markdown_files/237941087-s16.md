## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Coreference resolution models in the biomedical domain are evaluated through a systematic approach that includes the analysis of datasets, methodologies, and comparison of performance metrics. The evaluation process is delineated in various sections of the paper reviewed in the context provided.

First, the paper offers an overview of the main datasets used for studying biomedical coreference, enabling researchers to assess the models against standard benchmarks [2][3]. Coreference resolution is a fundamental NLP task, and the biomedical field faces unique challenges that necessitate tailored evaluation methodologies. The authors emphasize the importance of these datasets as they inform the baseline performance of different coreference models and facilitate comparisons among various approaches, including both traditional rule-based and newer deep learning-based models [1][3].

In terms of methodology, the paper outlines a specific section dedicated to comparing biomedical language representation models for coreference. This involves experiments to evaluate how effectively different models can process and resolve coreferences in biomedical texts. The experiments assess models based on their ability to accurately identify and link mentions of the same entities across texts [3][4]. This can include analyzing performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which are standard in evaluating NLP tasks, but tailored to the specific requirements and complexities of biomedical texts [4].

Furthermore, the paper explores how integrating biomedical domain knowledge, such as pre-training on biomedical texts or utilizing biomedical knowledge bases, has been shown to enhance the performance of these coreference models. The results from the conducted experiments suggest that models which leverage domain-specific knowledge can achieve improved performance, underscoring the necessity of integrating such knowledge into the evaluation framework [4][5]. This implies that methodologies for evaluation are not static but evolve with the ongoing advancements in model architecture and training approaches.

Lastly, the performance of previous models is also compared to the authors’ experiments, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of progress in the field [3]. The results are synthesized into a conclusion that expresses both the advancements made and the ongoing challenges faced within the domain of biomedical coreference resolution, reiterating the need for continued research and development in this area [4].

In summary, the evaluation of coreference resolution models in the biomedical domain comprises the use of benchmark datasets, methodological comparisons of performance, and the inclusion of domain-specific enhancements to model capabilities. The structured approach to evaluation is essential to derive meaningful insights that contribute to the advancement of NLP techniques in biomedical applications.

These models usually integrate biomedical specific information,typically specific rules, pre-trained embeddings and features.This paper reviews and analyses coreference datasets and models for the biomedical domain, as well as recent biomedical language representation models which can enhance coreference models with domain-specific knowledge.

BERT and SpanBERT were proposed to replace the LSTM encoder and achieved better performance on

Biomedical coreference is an essential but challenging task. Some efforts have been made in this field, but there is still a much room for improvement. The experiments which we conducted indicate biomedical domain knowledge from either pre-training on biomedical texts or integrating biomedical knowledge bases can enhance coreference models for the biomedical domain.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported in part by the China Scholarship Council, and the DALI project,ERC Grant 695662.ReferencesAlsentzer et al.

These models rely on syntactic parsers to extract hand-crafted features and rules.Nguyen et al. (2012) implemented a protein coreference system that makes use of syntactic information from the parser output, and protein-indicated information. The results showed that domain-specific semantic information is important for coreference resolution. Miwa et al. (2012) developed a rule-based coreference system, as a part of the EventMine event extraction system. A set of rules was developed based on syntactic trees and predicate-argument
