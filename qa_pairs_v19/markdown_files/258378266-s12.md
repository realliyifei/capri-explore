## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

The primary limitations of employing the top-k approximation in neural ranking models are related to the complexities associated with relevance estimation and the limitations of existing methodologies. 

First, one key challenge is that the outcomes of top-k approximations often lead to inefficiencies when it comes to obtaining a weaker initial retrieved list. Current approaches may entangle effectiveness with efficiency, where the focus on obtaining a fast retrieval (top-k) can compromise the quality of the ranking produced. As noted, using a task-specific approach can significantly reduce the computational burden typically associated with language models, which can enhance overall performance [3]. 

Moreover, while neural ranking models have shown great potential in terms of learning from raw text inputs and overcoming limitations associated with hand-crafted features, there remains a substantial gap in performance compared to breakthroughs seen in other domains like speech recognition and computer vision [4][5]. These limitations point to a need for further advancements in understanding how well these neural models can perform over the complex intricacies of ranking tasks, particularly under the constraints of top-k retrieval.

Additionally, there is an inherent challenge in defining and estimating relevance itself, which is often vague and influenced by the complexities of human cognitive processes [4]. This introduces further uncertainty in implementing top-k approximations effectively, as the relevance judgments relied upon may lead to unsatisfactory ranking outputs when not adequately captured by the model's learning processes.

Finally, despite the advancements in neural ranking methods, the community lacks comprehensive guidelines and design principles; this is essential for optimizing performance in various retrieval tasks, including the determination of the top-k results [5]. The understanding of the specific capabilities of neural ranking models relative to traditional information retrieval models is also insufficient, hindering the optimization of these systems for producing accurate top-k rankings [5].

In summary, the limitations of top-k approximations in neural ranking models are compounded by issues of effectiveness versus efficiency, the difficulty in estimating relevance, and the lack of established principles for guiding design and improvement within the field. Addressing these concerns is crucial for enhancing the utility of top-k approximations in practical applications of neural ranking models in information retrieval.

The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our solutions.2. Related WorkIn this section, we will review the background of this work. Firstly, we would like to introduce the fast neural ranking problem, which is generalized from the traditional Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. And then, possible solutions and limitations will be discussed which motivate the proposed method.2.1. Fast Neural RankingFast ranking or searching is the core problem of Information Retrieval, such as top-KùêæK recommender systems for e-commerce and link prediction for social networks. The queries (e.g., users in recommender systems) often have some context, say locations and time, which are unknown beforehand. So the search process is required to be conducted as an online manner. For online services, the search efficiency is as important as search effectiveness. We

Recently, with the advance of deep learning technology, we have witnessed a growing body of work in applying shallow or deep neural networks to the ranking problem in IR, referred to as neural ranking models in this paper. The power of neural ranking models lies in the ability to learn from the raw text inputs for the ranking problem to avoid many limitations of hand-crafted features. Neural networks have sufficient capacity to model complicated tasks, which is needed to handle the complexity of relevance estimation in ranking. Since there have been a large variety of neural ranking models proposed, we believe it is the right time to summarize the current status, learn from existing methodologies, and gain some insights for future development. In contrast to existing reviews, in this survey, we will take a deep look into the neural ranking models from different dimensions to analyze

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: There is still, however, much room for improvement in the effectiveness of these techniques for more complex retrieval tasks.In recent years, deep neural networks have led to exciting breakthroughs in speech recognition [5], computer vision [6, 7], and natural language processing (NLP) [8, 9]. These models have been shown to be effective at learning abstract representations from the raw input, and have sufficient model capacity to tackle difficult learning problems. Both of these are desirable properties for ranking models in IR. On one hand, most existing LTR models rely on hand-crafted features, which are usually time-consuming to design and often over-specific in definition. It would be of great value if ranking models could learn the useful ranking features automatically. On the other hand, relevance, as a key notion in IR, is often vague in definition and difficult to estimate since relevance judgments are based on a complicated human cognitive process. Neural models with
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: range of practical usage in the enterprise [40]. Neural ranking models already generate the most important features for modern search engines. However, beyond these exciting results, there is still a long way to go for neural ranking models: 1) Neural ranking models have not had the level of breakthroughs achieved by neural methods in speech recognition or computer vision; 2) There is little understanding and few guidelines on the design principles of neural ranking models; 3) We have not identified the special capabilities of neural ranking models that go beyond traditional IR models. Therefore, it is the right moment to take a look back, summarize the current status, and gain some insights for future development.There have been some related surveys on neural approaches to IR (neural IR for short). For example, Onal et al.[20] reviewed the current landscape of neural IR research, paying attention to the application of neural methods to different IR tasks. Mitra and Craswell [41]
