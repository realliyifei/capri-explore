## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

The primary limitations of employing the top-k approximation in neural ranking models are primarily highlighted in Passage 2. First, the sliding window approach used for identifying the k most relevant items in a ranked list cannot be parallelized effectively in its current form. This results in a lack of efficiency when processing large datasets since parallel processing can significantly reduce computation time and resource usage [2].

Secondly, the sliding window method leads to redundant computational steps, as it repeatedly re-scores the best set of documents while moving up the initial ranking list. This redundancy in computation is inefficient, as the same documents are evaluated multiple times, consuming unnecessary computational resources [2]. 

Lastly, this approach prioritizes scoring the lowest-ranked documents instead of focusing on the highest-ranked documents, which is contrary to optimal ranking strategies. A bottom-up approach may not yield the best efficiency in retrieving the most relevant results, as it does not leverage the already scored higher-ranking documents effectively [2]. 

Additionally, it is worth noting that neural ranking models still face challenges in further improving their effectiveness for complex retrieval tasks. While deep neural networks have shown great potential in learning from raw inputs, there is still much room for enhancement in addressing specific complexities associated with relevance estimation [5]. These factors suggest an inherent limitation in the top-k approximation's ability to utilize the full power of neural models while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness in information retrieval tasks.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: identify the proper size of the probable candidate set.‚Ä¢We extensively study our method on public datasets. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our solutions.2. Related WorkIn this section, we will review the background of this work. Firstly, we would like to introduce the fast neural ranking problem, which is generalized from the traditional Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. And then, possible solutions and limitations will be discussed which motivate the proposed method.2.1. Fast Neural RankingFast ranking or searching is the core problem of Information Retrieval, such as top-KùêæK recommender systems for e-commerce and link prediction for social networks. The queries (e.g., users in recommender systems) often have some context, say locations and time, which are unknown beforehand. So the search process is required to be conducted as an online manner. For online services, the search efficiency is as important as search effectiveness. We
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: UK‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉSean MacAvaney‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉDebasis Ganguly(2024)AbstractLarge Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many facets of natural language processing and information retrieval. Unlike previous encoder-based approaches, the enlarged context window of these generative models allows for ranking multiple documents at once, commonly called list-wise ranking. However, there are still limits to the number of documents that can be ranked in a single inference of the model, leading to the broad adoption of a sliding window approach to identify the kùëòk most relevant items in a ranked list. We argue that the sliding window approach is not well-suited for list-wise re-ranking because it (1) cannot be parallelized in its current form, (2) leads to redundant computational steps repeatedly re-scoring the best set of documents as it works its way up the initial ranking, and (3) prioritizes the lowest-ranked documents for scoring rather than the highest-ranked documents by taking a bottom-up
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: models, from traditional heuristic methods, probabilistic methods, to modern machine learning methods. Recently, with the advance of deep learning technology, we have witnessed a growing body of work in applying shallow or deep neural networks to the ranking problem in IR, referred to as neural ranking models in this paper. The power of neural ranking models lies in the ability to learn from the raw text inputs for the ranking problem to avoid many limitations of hand-crafted features. Neural networks have sufficient capacity to model complicated tasks, which is needed to handle the complexity of relevance estimation in ranking. Since there have been a large variety of neural ranking models proposed, we believe it is the right time to summarize the current status, learn from existing methodologies, and gain some insights for future development. In contrast to existing reviews, in this survey, we will take a deep look into the neural ranking models from different dimensions to analyze

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: There is still, however, much room for improvement in the effectiveness of these techniques for more complex retrieval tasks.In recent years, deep neural networks have led to exciting breakthroughs in speech recognition [5], computer vision [6, 7], and natural language processing (NLP) [8, 9]. These models have been shown to be effective at learning abstract representations from the raw input, and have sufficient model capacity to tackle difficult learning problems. Both of these are desirable properties for ranking models in IR. On one hand, most existing LTR models rely on hand-crafted features, which are usually time-consuming to design and often over-specific in definition. It would be of great value if ranking models could learn the useful ranking features automatically. On the other hand, relevance, as a key notion in IR, is often vague in definition and difficult to estimate since relevance judgments are based on a complicated human cognitive process.
