## Answer

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information regarding specific techniques used to handle context-dependency in text-to-SQL tasks. While it discusses the evolution of text-to-SQL systems, challenges such as cross-domain generalization, and general trends in methodologies employed in the field, it lacks detailed insights into particular strategies or techniques that are specifically aimed at addressing context-dependency issues within those tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given passages.

[1]: Passage ID 1: (NLP) research communities have invested considerable effort in addressing these challenges. Early Text-to-SQL approaches were predominantly based on predefined rules or templates (Baik et al., 2020; Quamar et al., 2022; Sen et al., 2020). These methods conceptualized the conversion task as a straightforward mapping exercise from natural language to SQL. Other techniques approached the problem from a sequence-to-sequence learning perspective, applying encoder-decoder models to capture the translation process (Cai et al., 2017; Popescu et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2022). However, recent advancements have seen the emergence of hybrid methods that synergize the strengths of both database and NLP technologies. These include approaches that consider schema relations (Hui et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a; Qi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2019, 2022b; Zheng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023d) and others that incorporate syntax parsing techniques (Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023b; Scholak et al., 2021;

[3]: Passage ID 3: queries through LLMs. The findings indicate a promising direction for future research, i.e. enhancing instructions with task-specific and contextualized rules, for boosting LLMs’ performance in NLP tasks.1 IntroductionText-to-SQL is a task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to automatically generate structured query language (SQL) queries from natural language text. This task enables users to access databases without requiring SQL knowledge or familiarity with the database schema, thus facilitating the work of data analysts and software developers who need to write complex SQL queries. Text-to-SQL has attracted significant interest from both industry and academia in recent years Wang et al. (2020); Choi et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2022).With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research areas of NLP are being revolutionized Zhao et al. (2023). LLMs can now serve as a general-purpose language task solver (to some extent), and they have shown
