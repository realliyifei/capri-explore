## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

In the context of handling context-dependency in text-to-SQL tasks, several techniques and considerations are important according to the provided passages.

1. **Hybrid Methods**: Recent advancements have led to hybrid methods that combine capabilities from both database technologies and natural language processing. These approaches take into account the schema relations and how they interact with the natural language input. This integration helps to better capture the dependencies between the context of the database and the natural language queries being processed [1].

2. **Schema Understanding**: A critical aspect of context-dependency handling in text-to-SQL tasks involves the comprehensive understanding of the database schema. This includes recognizing table names, column names, and the relationships between various tables within the schema. The complexity of the database schema often poses challenges for accurately generating SQL queries, and thus, effective schema representation plays a vital role in resolving context-dependencies [5].

3. **Incorporating Syntax Parsing**: Techniques that incorporate syntax parsing are also employed in text-to-SQL systems. Syntax parsing enables the dissection of natural language queries into comprehensible structures that can reveal contextual meanings, thereby aiding in more accurate SQL generation [1].

4. **Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)**: The integration of LLMs into text-to-SQL systems represents a transformative step in addressing context-dependency. LLMs have the ability to generate contextually relevant outputs based on the given input text, allowing for improved handling of semantic and syntactic nuances present in user queries [2]. These models, due to their extensive training on diverse data, can better understand and infer context from varied phrasing and structures of natural language.

5. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: One of the significant challenges noted in text-to-SQL systems is the struggle for models to generalize across different domain-specific contexts. This is mainly because models trained on a specific domain may have difficulty with questions posed in other domains due to differences in vocabulary and schema structure. Developing capabilities that allow for effective generalization with minimal domain-specific training is critical for managing context-dependency [3].

6. **Handling Ambiguity**: Natural language can be inherently ambiguous. Techniques that aim to resolve ambiguities—including the discernment of the user’s intent and the correct mapping of queries to SQL commands—are crucial. This often requires a deeper understanding of context and the ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge to ensure accurate interpretations [5].

In summary, techniques such as hybrid method designs, schema understanding, syntax parsing, the utilization of LLMs, cross-domain generalization, and ambiguity resolution collectively contribute to addressing the challenges of context-dependency in text-to-SQL tasks. These methods enhance the system’s ability to understand and accurately convert natural language queries into structured SQL commands, ultimately improving their effectiveness and user accessibility in database interactions.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: (NLP) research communities have invested considerable effort in addressing these challenges. Early Text-to-SQL approaches were predominantly based on predefined rules or templates (Baik et al., 2020; Quamar et al., 2022; Sen et al., 2020). These methods conceptualized the conversion task as a straightforward mapping exercise from natural language to SQL. Other techniques approached the problem from a sequence-to-sequence learning perspective, applying encoder-decoder models to capture the translation process (Cai et al., 2017; Popescu et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2022). However, recent advancements have seen the emergence of hybrid methods that synergize the strengths of both database and NLP technologies. These include approaches that consider schema relations (Hui et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a; Qi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2019, 2022b; Zheng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023d) and others that incorporate syntax parsing techniques (Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023b; Scholak et al., 2021;
2.

This task enables users to access databases without requiring SQL knowledge or familiarity with the database schema, thus facilitating the work of data analysts and software developers who need to write complex SQL queries. Text-to-SQL has attracted significant interest from both industry and academia in recent years Wang et al. (2020); Choi et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2022).With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research areas of NLP are being revolutionized Zhao et al. (2023). LLMs can now serve as a general-purpose language task solver (to some extent), and they have shown

[3]:  Passage ID 3: is an essential consideration.II-A4 Cross-Domain GeneralizationText-to-SQL systems often struggle to generalize across various database scenarios and domains.Models trained on a specific domain may not perform well on the proposed questions from other domains due to the variety in vocabulary, database schema structure, and question patterns.Developing systems that can effectively generalized to new domains with minimal domain-specific training data or fine-tuning adaptation is a significant challenge [77].II-B Evolutionary ProcessThe research field of text-to-SQL has witnessed significant advancements over the years in the NLP community, having evolved from rule-based methods to deep learning-based approaches and, more recently, to integrating pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), a sketch of the evolutionary process is shown in Fig. 2.II-B1 Rule-based MethodsEarly text-to-SQL systems relied heavily on rule-based methods [11, 12,
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: as businesses increasingly turn to data-driven decision-making, the ability to extract useful insights from databases without the need for SQL expertise becomes crucial for maintaining a competitive edge.However, as we mentioned in the previous section, despite the advancements in NLP and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text-to-SQL systems, many challenges remain unresolved, these include handling ambiguous queries, adapting to cross-domain scenarios, and generating accurate queries for complex database structures.
