## Answer (I don't know?: âœ“)

I don't know. The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the primary techniques for optimizing model parameters using human feedback or the categorization of these techniques. The passages predominantly discuss natural language processing (NLP) in general, focusing on its branches (natural language understanding and generation) and the significance of question answering systems, but they do not detail methods related to model optimization using human feedback. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your question based on the available information.

The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence.

Some of the common tasks in NLP are machine translation, text classification and text generation. Deep learning has been widely applied to solve real-world NLP problems. This section presents the recent advancements in deep learning models that have been designed for NLP over the past few years.4.3.1 Text ClassificationText classification known as text categorization, is a task that involves assigning predefined categories or labels to a piece of text based on its content. The task is commonly used in various applications such as document classification, sentiment analysis
