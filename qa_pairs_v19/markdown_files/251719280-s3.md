## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Single-domain text-to-SQL datasets continue to hold value despite their inherent limitations due to several key reasons related to their structure and the challenges they address in the development of text-to-SQL systems.

Firstly, these datasets provide a focused environment that allows for the detailed study and enhancement of models designed for specific domains. Since they focus on one domain, they typically have less variability in vocabulary, question patterns, and database schema structures, which simplifies the mapping of natural language questions to SQL queries [1]. This concentrated approach creates opportunities for more precise model training, allowing researchers to explore the nuances within a specific context. 

Moreover, single-domain datasets typically possess clear and well-defined schemas, which contribute to a more manageable learning curve for models. Understanding and effectively representing these schemas is crucial for generating accurate SQL queries, as it involves recognizing the relationships among tables and data relationships [5]. Therefore, having a dataset that emphasizes a single domain can enable developers to design and optimize their systems around these well-defined constraints.

Additionally, single-domain datasets allow for controlled experiments where researchers can isolate variables and impact factors that influence model performance. This capability is essential for incrementally improving algorithms without the complexities introduced by cross-domain variations [2]. By systematically studying single-domain datasets, researchers can develop robust methodologies that can later be adapted or extended to other domains.

Another significant point is that while single-domain datasets present limitations in generalizing to other areas, they can still serve as a foundation for building transfer learning techniques or hybrid models that later aim to tackle multiple domains. Furthermore, these datasets often provide insights into the specific challenges and linguistic features relevant to their respective domains. For instance, they highlight the importance of handling linguistic complexity and ambiguity, which are prevalent in natural language processing [5]. Understanding these domain-specific challenges can inform the development of more versatile models that can eventually generalize better when exposed to multi-domain data.

In summation, single-domain text-to-SQL datasets retain their value because they facilitate focused research and optimizations tailored to specific contexts, provide clear schemas for accurate SQL generation, allow for controlled experimental design, and offer insights into domain-specific linguistic features. These attributes make them essential for advancing the text-to-SQL field, even as the ultimate goal of achieving effective multi-domain generalization remains an important and active area of research [1][2][5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: is an essential consideration.II-A4 Cross-Domain GeneralizationText-to-SQL systems often struggle to generalize across various database scenarios and domains.Models trained on a specific domain may not perform well on the proposed questions from other domains due to the variety in vocabulary, database schema structure, and question patterns.Developing systems that can effectively generalized to new domains with minimal domain-specific training data or fine-tuning adaptation is a significant challenge [77].II-B Evolutionary ProcessThe research field of text-to-SQL has witnessed significant advancements over the years in the NLP community, having evolved from rule-based methods to deep learning-based approaches and, more recently, to integrating pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), a sketch of the evolutionary process is shown in Fig. 2.II-B1 Rule-based MethodsEarly text-to-SQL systems relied heavily on rule-based methods [11, 12,
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: question is a question restricted to the domain in which the database data is located and whose answer comes from its database. In essence, the question describes a SQL query. Executing the SQL query yields the answer to the question from its database[30]. Table I provides an overview of commonly used Text-to-SQL datasets, summarizing key features such as dataset size, interaction type, and domain coverage, which are essential for evaluating the generalization capability of Text-to-SQL models.Datasets in this domain typically have the following characteristics.Single/Cross Domain: database data source scenarios, according to the number of scenarios involved, can be divided into single fields and multiple fields[31], such as catering data and tourist attractions for two fields.Number of dialogue rounds: according to the number of dialogue rounds required for complete SQL generation, the dataset is divided into single and multiple rounds.SQL Complexity: Based on the SQL
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: (NLP) research communities have invested considerable effort in addressing these challenges. Early Text-to-SQL approaches were predominantly based on predefined rules or templates (Baik et al., 2020; Quamar et al., 2022; Sen et al., 2020). These methods conceptualized the conversion task as a straightforward mapping exercise from natural language to SQL. Other techniques approached the problem from a sequence-to-sequence learning perspective, applying encoder-decoder models to capture the translation process (Cai et al., 2017; Popescu et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2022). However, recent advancements have seen the emergence of hybrid methods that synergize the strengths of both database and NLP technologies. These include approaches that consider schema relations (Hui et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a; Qi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2019, 2022b; Zheng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023d) and others that incorporate syntax parsing techniques (Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023b; Scholak et al., 2021;
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Text-to-SQL included. These models’ expansive parameters and rich training data have culminated in a nuanced grasp of natural language, yielding more accurate SQL translations by parsing user intents effectively. Despite these advancements, current LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks are not fully optimized; they do not exhaust the possibilities offered by open-source LLMs, nor do they effectively incorporate external tools and knowledge that could refine Text-to-SQL performance. Our analysis, detailed in Table 1, indicates that current systems are limited in their approach. For instance, they often overlook complex one-to-many relationships crucial for constructing aggregate queries, such as totals, averages, and counts. Furthermore, they generally do not capitalize on execution error feedback, which can provide valuable insights for correcting SQL inaccuracies. Additionally, they lack a critic module designed to evaluate and rank SQL outputs from LLMs, which could significantly improve
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: technical challenges for text-to-SQL implementations can be summarized as follows:II-A1 Linguistic Complexity and AmbiguityNatural language questions often contain complex linguistic representations, such as nested clauses, coreferences, and ellipses, which make it challenging to map them accurately to the corresponding part of SQL queries [41].Additionally, natural language is inherently ambiguous, with multiple possible representations for a given user question [75, 76].Resolving these ambiguities and understanding the intent behind the user question requires deep natural language understanding and the capability to incorporate context and domain knowledge [33].II-A2 Schema Understanding and RepresentationTo generate accurate SQL queries, text-to-SQL systems need to have a comprehensive understanding of the database schema, including table names, column names, and relationships between various tables.However, the database schema can be complex and vary significantly
