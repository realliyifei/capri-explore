## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information regarding reranking techniques or their application in enhancing the accuracy of identifying multiword expressions in parsed text. The passages primarily discuss the creation of datasets, classification approaches for query processing in NLP, advancements in large language models, and the manual annotation process for entity recognition, but they do not address reranking or its relevance to identifying multiword expressions specifically. Therefore, the context is insufficient to answer the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the laws of thermodynamics?” Following a quality inspection of the synthetically produced questions, we assembled a training dataset of 1601 examples, consisting of 120 questions for each of the 12 topics and 161 general questions. We also derived a test dataset containing 364 examples with a balanced class distribution similar to the training dataset.In our experiments, we evaluated three classification approaches: vector similarity search, prompting a LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), and few-shot fine-tuning of a transformer model with the SetFit framework Tunstall et al. (2022). Concerning the vector search approach with the SPECTER2 model, we measured the cosine similarity to compare vectors of embedded user queries with paper embeddings in our vector database to retrieve the 100 most similar
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: years showed significant advancements [98, 7, 19] in natural language processing (NLP): Large language models (LLMs) emerged [8], facilitating new methodologies by describing tasks in natural language without a strong formalism. Because resource-intensive LLMs are not always superior [112], smaller, supervised learning-based models are still highly relevant for specialized domains or use cases that require rapid inference or are constrained by hardware limitations (such as mobile devices or offline scenarios) [34].One of these domains is entity recognition [73]. Entity recognition  (ER) describes the task of assigning a label to a sequence of words (e.g. to extract a person, a date or any other predefined label). To apply supervised learning to ER, data must be annotated. The manual annotation process, in which humans annotate data points with these predefined labels, is time-intensive and expensive [106]. Its output is an annotated dataset, which is also called corpus (pl. corpora)
