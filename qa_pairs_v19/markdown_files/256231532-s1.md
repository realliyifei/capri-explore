## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Social influence dialogue systems differ significantly from both task-oriented and open-domain systems in their roles and goals. The primary distinction lies in their ability to affect users’ cognitive and emotional responses, aiming to change thoughts, opinions, and behaviors through conversations.

1. **Role and Objective**: Social influence dialogue systems are explicitly designed to influence users, leveraging natural language interactions to evoke changes in feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, unlike task-oriented dialogue systems which focus on achieving specific tasks or goals (e.g., booking a ticket or finding information) [1]. On the other hand, open-domain systems, while they may engage users in conversations, do so without a specific intent to change the user's mindset or opinions but to provide an interactive social experience [1][5].

2. **Understanding User Needs**: These systems must have a comprehensive understanding of the semantics involved in the dialogue. They not only need to grasp the content but also must identify the emotional and social needs of users during interactions, which is less of a focus in traditional task-oriented systems [5]. The influence capability requires a deeper emotional intelligence that is not typically paramount in task-oriented dialogues.

3. **Personality and Trust**: Social influence systems must demonstrate a consistent personality, fostering trust and encouraging long-term relationships with users. This contrasts with task-oriented systems that prioritize efficiency over personality consistency [3]. Open-domain systems also require some level of consistent personality to satisfy human social needs, but the primary focus is different – more on entertainment or social engagement rather than influence [3][5].

4. **Interactivity Goals**: The social goals pursued by influence dialogue systems include entertainment and conforming to social norms, which might not be the case for task-oriented systems that aim solely for task completion. Open-domain systems can engage in interactive conversation but often lack the directed emotional engagement found in social influence dialogue systems [5]. Thus, the interactive nature of social influence dialogue systems is tied directly to their goals of emotional and cognitive persuasion.

5. **Emerging Research Needs**: Despite advancements in task-oriented and open-domain dialogue systems, research specifically focusing on social influence capabilities is still developing. The context provides that there is a lack of formal definitions and structured categorizations for these systems, which highlights the novelty of the social influence aspect in dialogue systems [1][2]. This opens avenues for further dedicated research efforts to refine and enhance these systems' capabilities.

In summary, while task-oriented systems aim for efficiency and open-domain systems prioritize social interaction, social influence dialogue systems are dedicated to manipulating user thoughts and emotions through conversational engagement, necessitating a sophisticated understanding of social dynamics and emotional intelligence.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: primarily focuses on either task-oriented or open-domain scenarios, a categorization that has been inadequate for capturing influence skills systematically. There exists no formal definition or category for dialogue systems with these skills and data-driven efforts in this direction are highly limited. In this work, we formally define and introduce the category of social influence dialogue systems that influence users’ cognitive and emotional responses, leading to changes in thoughts, opinions, and behaviors through natural conversations. We present a survey of various tasks, datasets, and methods, compiling the progress across seven diverse domains. We discuss the commonalities and differences between the examined systems, identify limitations, and recommend future directions. This study serves as a comprehensive reference for social influence dialogue systems to inspire more dedicated research and discussion in this emerging area.1 IntroductionConsider a human user who signs up

We organize them based on the system strategy, language generation, partner model, architecture, learning process, and the use of pretrained language models (Section 4). Finally, we identify key challenges and provide recommendations for future work (Section 5).Over the years, research in task-oriented and open-domain dialogues has benefited from a myriad of survey efforts Huang et al. (2020); Zhang et al. (2020c); Ni et al. (2021). We instead focus on dialogue systems with social influence capabilities and present a thorough review across various domains. We hope that our work serves as a timely entry point for interested researchers to take this area further, inspiring dedicated effort and discussion on social influence in the dialogue community.2 Social Influence Dialogue Systems“Social influence is a fact of everyday life” Gass (2015). It is the change in thoughts, feelings, attitudes, or behaviors resulting from interaction
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: work in persuasion tasks has focused on strategy/policy planning Georgila and Traum (2011); Sakai et al. (2020); Hiraoka et al. (2014, 2013); Tran et al. (2022); Black et al. (2014), while others have focused on classification Chen et al. (2021); Tian et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2019). Other work discussed challenges in building dialogue systems that are social in nature, stating that unlike task-oriented dialogue systems, open-domain social dialogue systems should form a consistent personality to develop users’ trust, satisfy the human need for affection and social belonging, and generate interpersonal responses Huang et al. (2020); Zhou et al. (2020); Walker et al. (2004) suitable for any input Higashinaka et al. (2014). Consistent with this need for affection and acknowledgement, Zhang andDanescu-Niculescu-Mizil (2020) find that in crisis counseling, it is necessary to balance the goals of both “empathetically addressing the crisis situation” and “advancing the conversation towards

Retraining the entire system is costly to maintain after the initial development. Recent work has proposed to augment the dialogue system with internet-search ability to generate more factual and updated responses in open-domain dialogues Komeili et al. (2021). Future efforts in this direction will benefit social influence dialogue systems as well.6 ConclusionsWe introduced the category of social influence dialogue systems that aim to influence their partners through dialogue. We presented a survey of the recent prior work in this space, compiling datasets and methods across diverse application domains. We pointed out key limitations in existing methodologies and proposed promising directions for designing more sophisticated systems in the future. Our survey reveals that although substantial progress has been

Interactiveness refers to the system’s ability to generate interpersonal responses to achieve particular social goals such as entertainment and conforming.The studies we select to present in this survey is based on our unique views and are by no means complete. Nevertheless, we hope that the discussion will inspire new research in
