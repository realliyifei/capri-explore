## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Social influence dialogue systems differ significantly from both task-oriented and open-domain systems in their roles and goals, primarily focusing on guiding users' cognitive and emotional responses through conversation. 

1. **Role and Objectives**: While task-oriented dialogue systems are designed to help users achieve specific tasks—such as booking a flight or making a reservation—social influence dialogue systems aim to influence users' thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and behaviors. These systems engage in conversations that can change users' beliefs or emotions, which is not the primary function of task-oriented bots [1]. Conversely, open-domain dialogue systems, unlike their task-oriented counterparts, strive to create long-term relationships with users by meeting their needs for communication and social belonging [5]. However, they do not necessarily focus on influencing the cognitive or emotional outcomes of these interactions.

2. **Nature of Interaction**: Social influence dialogue systems are characterized by their focus on establishing a connection with users beyond task completion. They are built to handle complex interpersonal dynamics, requiring an understanding of semantics to gauge the users’ emotional and social needs during conversations. This contrasts with task-oriented systems that emphasize functional user interaction and do not prioritize the emotional engagement or relationship aspect of the dialogue [5][3]. Open-domain systems might engage socially, but they may lack the systematic approach to influence users significantly [4].

3. **Character Building**: For social influence dialogue systems, maintaining a consistent personality is crucial for establishing trust and long-term relationships with users [3]. This focus on personality is less emphasized in task-oriented systems, which are primarily concerned with efficient task execution, and only to a limited extent in open-domain systems, which may still prioritize informative or entertaining responses without the goal of influence [5]. A system's ability to show empathy, for instance, is vital for social influence systems in crisis counseling to balance crisis management with conversational progression [3].

4. **Applications and Research Gaps**: The domain of social influence dialogue systems is relatively nascent compared to the more established research on task-oriented and open-domain systems. While substantial progress has been made in the latter two areas through various survey efforts, the specific study of social influence in dialogue systems has been limited [2]. This indicates not only a difference in the research focus but also an evolving landscape of challenges and opportunities unique to social influence dialogue systems, including the need for more detailed methodologies and classifications [1][4].

In summary, social influence dialogue systems diverge from task-oriented and open-domain systems by prioritizing emotional and cognitive influence during interactions, requiring a consistent personality, and focusing on long-term relationship building rather than merely functional task completion. Their unique challenges and objectives call for dedicated research, as they occupy a distinct niche in the dialogue systems landscape [1][2][4][5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: primarily focuses on either task-oriented or open-domain scenarios, a categorization that has been inadequate for capturing influence skills systematically. There exists no formal definition or category for dialogue systems with these skills and data-driven efforts in this direction are highly limited. In this work, we formally define and introduce the category of social influence dialogue systems that influence users’ cognitive and emotional responses, leading to changes in thoughts, opinions, and behaviors through natural conversations. We present a survey of various tasks, datasets, and methods, compiling the progress across seven diverse domains. We discuss the commonalities and differences between the examined systems, identify limitations, and recommend future directions. This study serves as a comprehensive reference for social influence dialogue systems to inspire more dedicated research and discussion in this emerging area.1 IntroductionConsider a human user who signs up

We organize them based on the system strategy, language generation, partner model, architecture, learning process, and the use of pretrained language models (Section 4). Finally, we identify key challenges and provide recommendations for future work (Section 5).Over the years, research in task-oriented and open-domain dialogues has benefited from a myriad of survey efforts Huang et al. (2020); Zhang et al. (2020c); Ni et al. (2021). We instead focus on dialogue systems with social influence capabilities and present a thorough review across various domains. We hope that our work serves as a timely entry point for interested researchers to take this area further, inspiring dedicated effort and discussion on social influence in the dialogue community.2 Social Influence Dialogue Systems“Social influence is a fact of everyday life” Gass (2015). It is the change in thoughts, feelings, attitudes, or behaviors resulting from interaction
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: work in persuasion tasks has focused on strategy/policy planning Georgila and Traum (2011); Sakai et al. (2020); Hiraoka et al. (2014, 2013); Tran et al. (2022); Black et al. (2014), while others have focused on classification Chen et al. (2021); Tian et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2019). Other work discussed challenges in building dialogue systems that are social in nature, stating that unlike task-oriented dialogue systems, open-domain social dialogue systems should form a consistent personality to develop users’ trust, satisfy the human need for affection and social belonging, and generate interpersonal responses Huang et al. (2020); Zhou et al. (2020); Walker et al. (2004) suitable for any input Higashinaka et al. (2014). Consistent with this need for affection and acknowledgement, Zhang andDanescu-Niculescu-Mizil (2020) find that in crisis counseling, it is necessary to balance the goals of both “empathetically addressing the crisis situation” and “advancing the conversation towards

Retraining the entire system is costly to maintain after the initial development. Recent work has proposed to augment the dialogue system with internet-search ability to generate more factual and updated responses in open-domain dialogues Komeili et al. (2021). Future efforts in this direction will benefit social influence dialogue systems as well.6 ConclusionsWe introduced the category of social influence dialogue systems that aim to influence their partners through dialogue. We presented a survey of the recent prior work in this space, compiling datasets and methods across diverse application domains. We pointed out key limitations in existing methodologies and proposed promising directions for designing more sophisticated systems in the future. Our survey reveals that although substantial progress has been

Interactiveness refers to the system’s ability to generate interpersonal responses to achieve particular social goals such as entertainment and conforming.The studies we select to present in this survey is based on our unique views and are by no means complete. Nevertheless, we hope that the discussion will inspire new research in
