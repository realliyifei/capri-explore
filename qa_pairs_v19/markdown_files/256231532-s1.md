## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information about the differences among social influence dialogue systems, task-oriented systems, and open-domain systems, or their specific roles and goals. While the passages discuss aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as ideologies influencing system development [1], advancements in question-answering systems [2][3], and the need to consider social hierarchies in language [4], they do not explicitly cover the distinctions or functionalities of the specified types of dialogue systems. Without specific details on social influence dialogue systems and how they compare to task-oriented and open-domain systems, an accurate response cannot be formulated.

In recent years, deep neural network-based approaches to realizing different forms of data-driven representation learning have gained widespread interest due to their competitiveness and flexibility. Question Answering (QA) is widely considered one of the most important tasks of NLP, as it enables humans to interact with machines in a more natural way by either extracting information related to questions from different knowledge sources or by generating the answer without the need for using structural query languages. In other words, QA tries to retrieve or generate answers in the form of a natural language based on a given input, instead of, providing a ranked list of documents as provided by search engines or classic information retrieval systems which require additional steps for checking each document to find useful content 12.Since the 1960s many question-answering systems have been

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: affected by NLP systems. Interrogate and reimagine the power relations between technologists and such communities.4.1 Language and social hierarchiesTurning first to (R1), we argue that work analyzing“bias” in NLP systems will paint a much fuller pictureif it engages with the relevant literature outside ofNLP that explores the relationships between language and socialhierarchies. Many disciplines, including sociolinguistics, linguisticanthropology, sociology, and social psychology, study how language takes on social meaning and the role that language plays in maintaining social hierarchies. For example, language is the means through which social groups are labeled and one way that beliefs about social groups are transmitted (e.g., Maass, 1999; Beukeboom and Burgers, 2019). Group labels can serve as the basis of stereotypes and thus reinforce social inequalities: “[T]he label content functions to identify a given category of people, and thereby conveys category boundaries
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: Bard and more specifically, tools such as ChatGPT have become a benchmark for other LLMs when solving most of the tasks involved in NLG research. This scenario poses new questions about the next steps for NLG and how the field can adapt and evolve to deal with new challenges in the era of LLMs.To address this, the present paper conducts a review of a representative sample of surveys recently published in NLG. By doing so, we aim to provide the scientific community with a research roadmap to identify which NLG aspects are still not suitably addressed by LLMs, as well as suggest future lines of research that should be addressed going forward.1 IntroductionNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a key component of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the sense that it enables humans and machines to interact more naturally. Despite NLP’s recent popularity, research in this area spans more than 60 years. The complexity involved in the understanding —Natural Language Understanding (NLU)— and
