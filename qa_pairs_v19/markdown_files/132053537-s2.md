## Answer

The main WordNet sense-annotated corpora include SemCor, which is the largest and most prominent example, comprising 352 documents from the Brown Corpus and containing 226,040 sense annotations [5]. SemCor has been extensively used in the literature to train supervised systems for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), making it a crucial resource in this field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) [5]. 

SemCor is significant because it provides a manually annotated dataset that serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of various WSD algorithms. With its wide usage, it ensures consistency and comparability among different studies and approaches, facilitating advancements in the methodologies employed for WSD [5]. The effectiveness of WSD hinges on the availability of reliable training data, and datasets like SemCor play a foundational role in this regard.

Additionally, WordNet itself, as a sense inventory, offers a structured set of lexical items (synsets) that represent various senses of a word [3] [5]. This standardization allows for consistent understanding and disambiguation of word meanings across different contexts, which is paramount for improving NLP systems’ performance [4]. By utilizing WordNet’s semantic hierarchy, researchers can leverage its well-defined relationships and generalizations, allowing systems to perform better in real-world applications where the meaning of words may vary significantly based on context [2] [3]. 

Moreover, the practice of compiling sense-annotated corpora has expanded beyond SemCor to include resources derived from platforms like Wikipedia and BabelNet, which also utilize WordNet as a base [3]. This diversification contributes to the robustness of WSD techniques by broadening the datasets available for training and testing [3].

In summary, the significance of word sense-annotated corpora such as SemCor lies in their provision of high-quality, annotated data that supports the development and evaluation of WSD technologies. Their importance is underscored by their widespread application in the training of supervised systems and their role in advancing the understanding of semantic ambiguities in language.

It consists in assigning the appropriate meaning from a pre-defined sense inventory to a word in context[Navigli (2009]. While knowledge-based approaches to this task have been proposed [Agirre et al. (2014, Moro et al. (2014, Butnaru et al. (2017, Chaplot andSalakhutdinov (2018], supervised approaches [Zhong and Ng (2010, Melamud et al. (2016,

Second, in order to make the task more challenging, we chose 191919 documents with highest average ambiguity for construction of SBU-WSD-Corpus. As prepsocessing step, we first manually tokenized, lemmatized, and PoS-tagged the documents to make them ready for the sense annotation phase.3.2 Sense InventoryWordNet (Miller et al., 1990) is one of the most widely used lexical resources in many areas of NLP including WSD. It was originally designed for English at Princeton University. The basic components of WordNet are synsets, each expressing a unique concept by a set of words with the same meaning and PoS, a gloss (i.e, a brief definition of the synset words), and possibly

Finally, we provide a general overview and statistics of these sense-annotated resources, providing relevant details across resources and languages.2.   Sense-Annotated CorporaFigure 1: Overview of sense inventories with their corresponding sense-annotated corpora.In this Section we describe the main efforts compiling sense-annotated corpora. We present currently available corpora for three resources: WordNet (Section 2.1), Wikipedia (Section 2.2) and BabelNet (Section 2.3). Figure 1 provides an overview of these resources and their underlying corpora.2.1.   WordNetWordNet [Fellbaum (1998] has been one of the most widely used knowledge resource in lexical semantics. In fact, it is the de-facto standard sense inventory for Word Sense Disambiguation since many years. The core unit in WordNet is the synset. A synset represents a concept or a meaning which is represented by its various

(2018) and BERT Devlin et al. (2019), have been used with a high degree of success on WSD. They have been used differently depending on the nature of the disambiguation task: as feature providers for other neural architectures Vial et al. (2019), simple classifiers after fine-tuning Wang et al. (2019), or as generators of contextual embeddings to be matched through nearest neighbours (Melamud et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2018; Loureiro and Jorge, 2019; Reif et al., 2019, 1NN). Our experiments in this paper will focus on improving the latter type of approach. In particular, we will investigate the state-of-the-art LMMS model Loureiro and Jorge (2019). This model learns sense embeddings based on BERT states. These embeddings are then propagated through WordNet’s
[5]: Passage ID 5: de-facto standard sense inventory for Word Sense Disambiguation since many years. The core unit in WordNet is the synset. A synset represents a concept or a meaning which is represented by its various lexicalizations (i.e. senses). For example, the synset defined as motor vehicle with four wheels can be expressed by its synonym senses auto, automobile, machine and motorcar. In what follows we list the main WordNet sense-annotated corpora, using WordNet 3.0 as reference sense inventory.SemCor.The first and most prominent example of sense-annotated corpora is SemCor [Miller et al. (1993b]. SemCor was manually annotated and consists of 352 documents from the Brown Corpus [Kucera and Francis (1979] and 226,040 sense annotations. SemCor is the largest manually-annotated corpus and the most used in the literature to train WSD supervised systems [Agirre et al. (2009, Zhong and Ng (2010, Raganato et al. (2017b, Luo et al.
