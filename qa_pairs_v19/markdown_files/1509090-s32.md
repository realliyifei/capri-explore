## Answer

## I don't know?: False

In natural language processing (NLP), the pre-identification of multiword expressions (MWEs) presents several challenges and limitations that affect subsequent parsing and overall system performance.

Firstly, MWEs possess unique linguistic characteristics that differentiate them from generic word combinations, both syntactically and semantically [3] [4]. This complexity complicates the development of algorithms capable of accurately identifying MWEs, as standard parsing techniques may not adequately handle their specific structures. For instance, idiomatic expressions often defy standard semantic interpretation, making their identification a significant bottleneck within various NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT) [2].

Additionally, the pervasive nature of MWEs across all domains highlights their ubiquitous presence in languages, increasing the computational demands on NLP systems [3] [4]. When MWEs are not adequately recognized, automatic translations may suffer, leading to incorrect or misleading outputs that can jeopardize applications such as text summarization and web search [1]. The reliance on precise detection mechanisms means that any failure to effectively identify MWEs can produce compounding errors in tasks relying on accurate NLP outputs.

Training machine learning models for MWE identification adds another layer of complexity. While approaches have been devised to treat MWE detection as a supervised task, these methods require large and well-annotated datasets for effective training [5]. The availability and quality of such datasets can be limited, particularly in less-studied languages or niche domains. Even with robust datasets, the variability in MWEs (e.g., regional idioms or domain-specific expressions) creates difficulties in ensuring comprehensive coverage and accuracy across different use cases [5].

Moreover, the integration of advanced models, such as neural networks incorporating Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, has achieved improved performance in identifying MWEs, but these models rely heavily on the availability of substantial amounts of training data that may not always be present [5]. This dependency can lead to overfitting if the models are tuned too closely to the training data, reducing their effectiveness on unseen data and real-world applications.

Finally, the overall pipeline of NLP applications must accommodate the preprocessing of MWEs before further parsing occurs. This separation can create challenges in the workflow, necessitating additional resources and time to ensure that these expressions are detected and handled appropriately before any further language analysis takes place [5]. Such additional stages can also introduce latency in real-time applications.

In conclusion, the challenges associated with pre-identifying MWEs in NLP systems include their unique linguistic properties, the need for high-quality annotated data for training, the computational complexity involved in their detection, and the potential latency introduced in processing pipelines. Each of these challenges underscores the critical importance of effective MWE identification in enhancing the performance and reliability of NLP applications.

[1]:  Passage ID 1: be done before one can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWEs successfully [12].The study of multiword expressions in NLP has been gaining prominence, and in recent years the number of researchers and projects focusing on them has increased dramatically. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for NLP, including MT and Translation Technology. The inability to detect MWEs automatically may result in incorrect (and even unfortunate) automatic translations and may jeopardise the performance of applications such as text summarisation and web search.Multiword expressions do not only play a crucial role in the computational treatment of natural languages. Often terms are multiword expressions (and not single words), making them highly relevant to terminology. The requirement for correct rendering of MWEs in translation and interpretation highlights their importance in these fields. Given the pervasive nature of MWEs, they play a crucial

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: (MT) [17, 16], which depends on a clear distinction between word tokens and phrases, has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs [8, 29]. The usual approach in these applications is to identify MWEs first, and then treat them accordingly. Therefore, detecting MWEs is a key research area in NLP.In recent years, the identification of MWEs has been modelled as a supervised machine learning task where the machine learning models are trained on an annotated dataset. As we explain in Section 2, several datasets have been released to train these machine learning models. Furthermore shared tasks such as SemEval-2016 Task 10 [28] and PARSEME [27] have contributed to develop datasets. In recent years, neural network-based models, and in particular architectures incorporating RecurrentNeural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in MWE identification tasks [27]. Usually, these models utilise
