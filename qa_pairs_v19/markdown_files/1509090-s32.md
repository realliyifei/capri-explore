## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Identifying multiword expressions (MWEs) prior to parsing in natural language processing (NLP) systems presents several challenges and limitations. These challenges stem from the unique linguistic properties of MWEs, the complexity of their detection, and their impact on the overall performance of NLP applications.

Firstly, MWEs exhibit distinct syntactic and semantic behavior that differs significantly from that of generic word combinations. This non-standard behavior complicates their identification, as MWEs are not always predictable based on the individual meanings of the words that compose them. For instance, phrases such as "kick the bucket" carry idiomatic meanings that cannot be derived from the meanings of "kick" or "bucket" when considered in isolation [3] [4]. This idiosyncratic nature of MWEs presents a fundamental challenge in developing algorithms capable of recognizing them with high accuracy.

Additionally, MWEs are categorized into various types (e.g., idioms, fixed phrases, and collocations), which can further complicate their identification. Since MWEs are pervasive across different linguistic domains, processing systems must be robust enough to handle diverse expression forms, along with variations in syntax and semantics that may arise in different contexts [1] [3]. Therefore, accurate detection requires substantial training data, making the development of effective machine learning models more complex [5]. 

Moreover, the lack of a universally agreed-upon definition and classification for MWEs adds another layer of difficulty. Different applications may prioritize different types of MWEs based on their specific needs, leading to variations in detection strategies. Since current automatic evaluation metrics often fail to adequately capture the nuances of MWEs, this could result in a misrepresentation of system capabilities, subsequently affecting the overall quality of machine translation (MT) outputs [2].

Another limitation is the dependency on annotated datasets for training supervised machine learning models that aim to identify MWEs. Creating such datasets is resource-intensive and time-consuming, as it requires manual annotation of large corpuses, considering the appropriate identification and categorization of various MWEs [5]. The reliance on these datasets means that the performance of any MWE detection model may vary significantly based on the quality and comprehensiveness of the training data, leading to issues with generalization in real-world applications.

Lastly, if MWEs are not identified correctly before parsing, it can lead to erroneous interpretations or translations. The incorrect handling of MWEs threatens the accuracy and effectiveness of subsequent NLP tasks such as text summarization or information retrieval, as the meaning conveyed by multiword expressions can be crucial for understanding context [1] [2]. Overall, the integration and pre-identification of MWEs in NLP systems remain an open and pressing challenge that demands ongoing research and innovation.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: be done before one can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWEs successfully [12].The study of multiword expressions in NLP has been gaining prominence, and in recent years the number of researchers and projects focusing on them has increased dramatically. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for NLP, including MT and Translation Technology. The inability to detect MWEs automatically may result in incorrect (and even unfortunate) automatic translations and may jeopardise the performance of applications such as text summarisation and web search.Multiword expressions do not only play a crucial role in the computational treatment of natural languages. Often terms are multiword expressions (and not single words), making them highly relevant to terminology. The requirement for correct rendering of MWEs in translation and interpretation highlights their importance in these fields. Given the pervasive nature of MWEs, they play a crucial

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: (MT) [17, 16], which depends on a clear distinction between word tokens and phrases, has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs [8, 29]. The usual approach in these applications is to identify MWEs first, and then treat them accordingly. Therefore, detecting MWEs is a key research area in NLP.In recent years, the identification of MWEs has been modelled as a supervised machine learning task where the machine learning models are trained on an annotated dataset. As we explain in Section 2, several datasets have been released to train these machine learning models. Furthermore shared tasks such as SemEval-2016 Task 10 [28] and PARSEME [27] have contributed to develop datasets. In recent years, neural network-based models, and in particular architectures incorporating RecurrentNeural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in MWE identification tasks [27]. Usually, these models utilise
