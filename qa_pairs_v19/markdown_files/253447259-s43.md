## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided discusses limitations of reference-based metrics in evaluating grammatical error correction systems but does not specify how these metrics improve upon traditional methods. In fact, the context suggests that reference-based evaluations suffer from biases and limitations, advocating for a paradigm shift in evaluation methodology instead of highlighting improvements. Without additional details on the specific improvements offered by reference-based metrics compared to traditional methods, I cannot provide a complete answer.

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: fully capture the full range of system capabilities and objectives. Reference-based evaluations suffer from limitations in capturing the wide variety of possible correction and the biases introduced during reference creation and is prone to favor fixing local errors over overall text improvement. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further highlighted the shortcomings of these evaluation strategies, emphasizing the need for a paradigm shift in evaluation methodology. In the current study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of various GEC systems using a recently published dataset of Swedish learner texts. The evaluation is performed using established evaluation metrics as well as human judges. We find that GPT-3 in a few-shot setting by far outperforms previous grammatical error correction systems for Swedish, a language comprising only 0.11% of its training data. We also found that current evaluation methods contain undesirable biases that a human evaluation is able
