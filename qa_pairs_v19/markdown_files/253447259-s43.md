## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information to directly answer the question about how reference-based metrics improve upon traditional methods for evaluating grammatical error correction. While the passages reference various works concerning grammatical error correction (GEC) metrics and evaluations, they primarily focus on the development, limitations, and types of metrics, such as Grammaticality-Based Metrics (GBMs) and reference-less metrics, without explicitly detailing how reference-based metrics enhance traditional evaluation methods. Thus, I cannot construct a complete response based on the provided context.

Specifically, the authors proposed three Grammaticality-Based Metrics (GBMs) that either use a benchmark GEC system to count the errors in the output produced by other GEC systems or else predict a grammaticality score using a pretrained ridge regression model (Heilman et al., 2014). The main limitation of these metrics is that they i) require an existing GEC system to evaluate other GEC systems and ii) are insensitive to changes in meaning. The authors thus proposed interpolating reference-less metrics with other reference-based metrics.GFMAsano, Mizumoto, and Inui (2017) extended the work on GBMs by introducing three reference-less metrics for Grammaticality, Fluency and Meaning preservation (GFM). Specifically, the Grammaticality metric combines Napoles, Sakaguchi, and Tetreault’s 2016 GBMs into a single model, the Fluency metric computes a score using a language model, and the Meaning preservation
