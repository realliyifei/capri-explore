## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Similarity scores and feature-based metrics can play a crucial role in active learning (AL) for natural language processing (NLP) tasks by enhancing the process of instance selection, thus ensuring effective utilization of annotation resources. The integration of these metrics into active learning strategies can lead to more efficient data labeling and improved model performance.

One way similarity scores are applied in active learning is through the use of similarity-based oversampling algorithms. This approach allows the model to assess the confidence of its label assignments. In scenarios where the algorithm lacks confidence in certain instances, these instances can be flagged for review by domain experts. This selective labeling strategy not only ensures high-quality labels but also reduces the effort required from human annotators, addressing the challenges posed by the typically laborious and expensive labeling processes in NLP tasks [1]. By using similarity metrics, the model can prioritize data points that are not only uncertain but also strategically important for learning, thus optimizing the overall annotation process.

Additionally, feature-based metrics such as cosine similarity can be employed in the context of vector similarity search. For instance, in the evaluation of queries against a dataset—in this case, comparing user queries with document embeddings in a vector database—the cosine similarity measure assesses how closely related different texts are. This technique enhances the retrieval of relevant instances, as it allows the model to identify and select cases that are most similar to the current query demands [2]. Furthermore, when classifying data, similarity scores provide a solid foundation for determining which instances should be included in the training set based on their relevance to the task at hand, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.

Moreover, the tailoring of similarity metrics specifically for multi-label text data allows for a nuanced understanding of textual characteristics, which can lead to better alignment of the selected instances with task-specific requirements [1]. By analyzing diverse datasets across various domains, researchers can establish recommendations on optimal parameter configurations, enhancing the versatility and adaptability of active learning algorithms in NLP contexts [1].

In summary, applying similarity scores and feature-based metrics within active learning frameworks specifically for NLP tasks facilitates the identification of uncertain instances, optimizes the labeling process, and ensures that the most relevant and representative data points are selected for training models. This ultimately helps to alleviate the burdens associated with data annotation while improving the performance and efficiency of NLP systems. The ongoing research into these methods indicates a promising direction for advancing practices in the field.

Second, it would be valuable to test this method on diverse datasets across multiple domains to better understand the relationship between dataset characteristics and parameter settings. Such research could lead to recommendations on optimal parameter configurations for different types of datasets, thereby enhancing the algorithm’s versatility and adaptability.Integrating active learning with the similarity-based oversampling algorithm represents another promising direction. In cases where the algorithm has low confidence in assigning labels to certain instances, these instances could be flagged for review by domain experts. This selective labeling strategy would streamline the labeling process, ensuring high-quality labels while reducing the overall effort required by human

To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the laws of thermodynamics?” Following a quality inspection of the synthetically produced questions, we assembled a training dataset of 1601 examples, consisting of 120 questions for each of the 12 topics and 161 general questions. We also derived a test dataset containing 364 examples with a balanced class distribution similar to the training dataset.In our experiments, we evaluated three classification approaches: vector similarity search, prompting a LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), and few-shot fine-tuning of a transformer model with the SetFit framework Tunstall et al. (2022). Concerning the vector search approach with the SPECTER2 model, we measured the cosine similarity to compare vectors of embedded user queries with paper embeddings in our vector database to retrieve the 100 most similar
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: related topics and future directions.1 IntroductionThe majority of modern natural language processing (NLP) systems are based on data-driven machine learning models. The success of these models depends on the quality and quantity of the available target training data. While these models can obtain impressive performance if given enough supervision, it is usually expensive to collect large amounts of annotations, especially considering that the labeling process can be laborious and challenging for NLP tasks (§3.2). Active learning (AL), an approach that aims to achieve high accuracy with fewer training labels by allowing a model to choose the data to be annotated and used for learning, is a widely-studied approach to tackle this labeling bottleneck (Settles, 2009).Active learning has been studied for more than twenty years (Lewis and Gale, 1994; Lewis and Catlett, 1994; Cohn et al., 1994, 1996) and there have been several literature surveys on this topic (Settles, 2009; Olsson,
