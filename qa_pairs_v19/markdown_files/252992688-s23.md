## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Active learning (AL) and data augmentation (DA) can be effectively combined to enhance instance querying in natural language processing (NLP) by creating a more efficient learning process that maximizes the utility of limited annotated data. Here’s how this synergy works:

1. **Role of Active Learning**: Active learning is designed to improve model performance while reducing the amount of labeled data required. The central idea is that the model actively selects the most informative data points for labeling, which allows it to build a robust understanding of the dataset with fewer instances [1][5]. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource settings where labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data are plentiful [3].

2. **Data Augmentation Techniques**: Data augmentation can improve the diversity and quantity of training datasets, which is crucial for enhancing model robustness. Techniques such as paraphrasing, synonym replacement, and back-translation are traditional forms of data augmentation, but leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generating realistic and varied text can significantly enrich these datasets [1][2]. Such LLM-based augmentations, as demonstrated by methods like GPT3Mix, introduce a range of linguistic variations and contextual scenarios that can improve model generalization [1].

3. **Integrating Active Learning with Data Augmentation**: One effective approach is to use data augmentation methods to generate additional training examples that enhance the model’s understanding of the target domain. Active learning can then be employed to select which of these augmented examples are most relevant for further processing, thereby reducing the human annotation effort required while maintaining high accuracy [3][4]. In practice, this might involve generating a pool of augmented instances and having an active learner choose the ones that it predicts will contribute most to its learning progress.

4. **Feedback Loop with Domain Experts**: Incorporating domain experts as early as possible in the active learning process can also boost performance. Domain experts can review and select specific augmentation outcomes that address real-world challenges, ensuring that the model is trained on data that reflects actual user queries and needs [3]. This human-in-the-loop strategy helps bridge the gap between data generation and practical application, making the learning process more aligned with the intended outcomes.

5. **Outcome and Efficiency**: By combining these approaches, the overall performance of the NLP system can be enhanced, especially in settings characterized by linguistic diversities and low labeled data availability. The synergy between active learning and data augmentation leads to a more efficient querying process, where the model not only learns from the original instances but also adapts and improves from augmented counterparts selected through active querying strategies [3][5].

In summary, the combined use of active learning and data augmentation creates a mutually beneficial dynamic that can significantly enhance instance querying in NLP tasks. By leveraging informed selections of augmented data points, models can achieve greater accuracy while mitigating the challenges associated with limited training datasets.

Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: related topics and future directions.1 IntroductionThe majority of modern natural language processing (NLP) systems are based on data-driven machine learning models. The success of these models depends on the quality and quantity of the available target training data. While these models can obtain impressive performance if given enough supervision, it is usually expensive to collect large amounts of annotations, especially considering that the labeling process can be laborious and challenging for NLP tasks (§3.2). Active learning (AL), an approach that aims to achieve high accuracy with fewer training labels by allowing a model to choose the data to be annotated and used for learning, is a widely-studied approach to tackle this labeling bottleneck (Settles, 2009).Active learning has been studied for more than twenty years (Lewis and Gale, 1994; Lewis and Catlett, 1994; Cohn et al., 1994, 1996) and there have been several literature surveys on this topic (Settles, 2009; Olsson,
