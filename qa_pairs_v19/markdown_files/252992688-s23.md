## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Active Learning (AL) and data augmentation can be effectively combined to enhance instance querying by leveraging both approaches to optimize learning efficiency and maximize the use of limited labeled data. The integration of these methods can be particularly beneficial in low-resource settings, where annotated samples are scarce, but a large number of unlabeled documents may be available for use.

Firstly, the combination of AL and data augmentation allows for improved selection of informative data instances. Active Learning selectively queries the most uncertain instances that the learning model is least confident about, which often helps to optimize the training process by focusing on the most relevant data points [3]. This approach can reduce labor-intensive annotation efforts, thus enhancing performance metrics with less training data [3]. 

In a low-resource context, data augmentation can significantly alleviate the cold start problem typically faced when only a few annotated instances are available. Generating synthetic data points allows for the exploration of potential key similarities and differences among existing labels [2]. This method can provide additional training examples that may closely resemble real instances, thereby improving model robustness and reliability as shown in experiments within text classification tasks [2].

Specifically, an adaptive framework like LADA integrates AL with data augmentation by predicting the acquisition scores for both unlabeled data instances and the synthetic data instances generated through data augmentation techniques. This forward-looking approach ensures that the most informative instances are chosen for training [4]. By continuously updating the selection criteria based on learned policies, LADA enhances the effectiveness of both querying and synthetic data generation, ultimately leading to improved performance across various datasets [4].

Additionally, incorporating human expertise into the AL process at early stages can further refine the querying strategy. Engaging domain experts to provide targeted annotations helps to shape the learning process more effectively, allowing the model to focus on areas where human insights significantly enhance learning [1]. The findings indicate that this integration can lead to better performance in domain-specific settings, providing low-labeling-effort solutions in specialized domains [1][5].

In conclusion, the effective combination of Active Learning and data augmentation fosters a synergistic enhancement of instance querying by selectively choosing informative data points while generating additional useful examples. This not only improves the performance in low-resource contexts but also leverages both human and machine strengths to develop robust, efficient models in Natural Language Processing.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: on.In this work we propose a novel approach that combines data augmentation via question-answer generation with Active Learning to improve performance in low resource settings, where the target domains are diverse in terms of difficulty and similarity to the source domain.We also investigate Active Learning for question answering in different stages, overall reducing the annotation effort of humans.For this purpose, we consider target domains in realistic settings, with an extremely low amount of annotated samples but with many unlabeled documents, which we assume can be obtained with little effort.Additionally, we assume sufficient amount of labeled data from the source domain is available.We perform extensive experiments to find the best setup for incorporating domain experts.Our findings show that our novel approach, where humans are incorporated as early as possible in the process, boosts performance in the low-resource, domain-specific setting, allowing for
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: a pivotal concern in enhancing data efficiency. Our approach is inspired by Variation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the essential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what changes. Instead of just querying with existing datapoints, our approach synthesizes artificial datapoints that highlight potential key similarities and differences among labels using a neuro-symbolic pipeline combining large language models (LLMs) and rule-based models. Through an experiment in the example domain of text classification, we show that our approach achieves significantly higher performance when there are fewer annotated data. As the annotated training data gets larger the impact of the generated data starts to diminish showing its capability to address the cold start problem in AL. This research sheds light on integrating theories of human learning into the optimization of AL.1 IntroductionActive learning (AL) allows users to provide focused
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: model accuracy.1 IntroductionActive learning allows machine learning algorithms to choose their learning data selectively. This methodology optimizes learning efficiency while reducing the need for labor-intensive labeled instances, often leading to enhancing the performance metrics with less training (Settles et al., 2008).While Active Learning has been explored in research for over two decades, it has seen a resurgence of interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly around 2009-2010. This resurgence has been aligned with adopting neural models in NLP research (Zhang et al., 2022b). Recent trends suggest the advantageous pairing of Active Learning techniques with deep learning methodologies (Zhang et al., 2022b).A prevalent strategy within Active Learning is uncertainty sampling. This technique involves the algorithm selecting instances in which the model might be least certain about their labels. For instance, in binary classification tasks, it might select

[4]:  Passage ID 4: world where gathering a large-scale labeled dataset is difficult because of the constrained human or computational resources, learning the deep neural network requires an effective utilization of the limited resources. This limitation motivated the integration of data augmentation and active learning.This paper proposes a generalized framework for such integration, named as LADA, which adaptively selects the informative data instances by looking ahead the acquisition score of both 1) the unlabeled data instances and 2) the virtual data instances to be generated by data augmentation, in advance of the acquisition process. To enhance the effect of the data augmentation, LADA learns the augmentation policy to maximize the acquisition score.With repeated experiments on the various datasets and the comparison models, LADA shows a considerable performance by selecting and augmenting informative data instances. The qualitative analysis shows the different behavior of LADA that finds the

MRQA models generally need plenty of annotations, therefore several methods have been devised for augmenting data by generating new annotated samples, with the ultimate goal of improving quality of predictions.Some of these approaches show a real benefit in the downstream MRQA task; however, there is no work focusing on employing Language Models (LM) fine-tuned
