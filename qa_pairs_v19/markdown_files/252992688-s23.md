## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Active learning (AL) and data augmentation are two powerful techniques that, when effectively combined, can enhance instance querying in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in scenarios with limited training data. Active learning allows a model to selectively query the most informative data points for annotation, thus optimizing the learning process with fewer labeled examples. Data augmentation, on the other hand, refers to increasing the diversity of the training dataset through techniques such as paraphrasing, synonym replacement, and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate new text data [1] [2].

Combining these two approaches can lead to significant improvements in low-resource settings. Active learning can be employed to identify the most challenging instances in the dataset, which are then augmented using various techniques. For instance, LLMs can generate realistic and diverse examples based on the selected instances, thereby enriching the training data with varying linguistic structures and contexts [1] [2]. This allows the model to learn not just from the original instances but also from a broader range of variations, enhancing its ability to generalize and perform well in different scenarios.

Moreover, the novel approach proposed in the context combines data augmentation via question-answer generation with active learning to improve performance specifically in low-resource domains [3]. In this setup, AL is utilized to decide which questions or topics are most critical, while the question-answer generation process can create diverse and informative examples that can boost both model performance and coverage. This is particularly beneficial in settings where annotated data is scarce, as it reduces the overall annotation burden on human experts while still improving model accuracy.

In addition, leveraging domain experts early in the process can refine the data augmentation strategy further. By incorporating human insights into the types of variations that are most useful for each target domain, the combined AL and augmentation approach can be tailored to specific challenges of the domain [3]. This collaborative model can significantly reduce the amount of effort required in generating annotated data while ensuring high accuracy and performance.

In conclusion, the effective combination of active learning and data augmentation can lead to enhanced instance querying by enabling models to focus on the most informative data points while simultaneously enriching their training data with a variety of linguistic and contextual variations. This modular approach not only addresses the challenges of working in low-resource environments but also streamlines the learning process, allowing for better performance across diverse domains in NLP.

Traditional methods include paraphrasing, synonym replacement, and back-translation. In the future, however, data augmentation in NER could be significantly facilitated and enhanced by leveraging LLMs. LLMs can generate realistic and diverse text data, which can be used to augment existing datasets for NER training. This approach, as exemplified by techniques like GPT3Mix (Yoo et al., 2021), makes it possible to create more robust and more accurate NER models by enriching training data with a wide range of linguistic variations and contextual scenarios.5.3 Active learningActive learning is a form of semi-supervised learning.

[3]:  Passage ID 3: on.In this work we propose a novel approach that combines data augmentation via question-answer generation with Active Learning to improve performance in low resource settings, where the target domains are diverse in terms of difficulty and similarity to the source domain.We also investigate Active Learning for question answering in different stages, overall reducing the annotation effort of humans.For this purpose, we consider target domains in realistic settings, with an extremely low amount of annotated samples but with many unlabeled documents, which we assume can be obtained with little effort.Additionally, we assume sufficient amount of labeled data from the source domain is available.We perform extensive experiments to find the best setup for incorporating domain experts.Our findings show that our novel approach, where humans are incorporated as early as possible in the process, boosts performance in the low-resource, domain-specific setting, allowing for
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: related topics and future directions.1 IntroductionThe majority of modern natural language processing (NLP) systems are based on data-driven machine learning models. The success of these models depends on the quality and quantity of the available target training data. While these models can obtain impressive performance if given enough supervision, it is usually expensive to collect large amounts of annotations, especially considering that the labeling process can be laborious and challenging for NLP tasks (§3.2). Active learning (AL), an approach that aims to achieve high accuracy with fewer training labels by allowing a model to choose the data to be annotated and used for learning, is a widely-studied approach to tackle this labeling bottleneck (Settles, 2009).Active learning has been studied for more than twenty years (Lewis and Gale, 1994; Lewis and Catlett, 1994; Cohn et al., 1994, 1996) and there have been several literature surveys on this topic (Settles, 2009; Olsson,
