## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

The context provided does not offer specific details about how Krippendorff's α (alpha) addresses different types of disagreements in computational linguistics. While it mentions that Krippendorff’s α is defined in terms of discrepancies and suggests that it is a measure of agreement rather than disagreement, the passages do not elaborate on the mechanisms or methodologies employed by Krippendorff's α in handling various forms of disagreement specific to computational linguistics.

Furthermore, while it is indicated that Krippendorff's α provides a sensible measure of agreement when appropriately contextualized, the passages lack explicit examples or applications of how this measurement applies to different types of disagreements encountered in NLP tasks. Additionally, the references to the methodology and comparison of Krippendorff’s α to alternative approaches do not detail the specific types of disagreements considered or measured within NLP frameworks.

Thus, the overall context is insufficient to answer the question regarding how Krippendorff's α specifically handles different types of disagreements in computational linguistics. Therefore, I must state: I don't know.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: describe our package’s bootstrap inference for α𝛼\alpha and compare the performance of our procedure to that of two alternative approaches. In Section 4 we briefly discuss robustness and influence. In Section 5 we provide a thorough demonstration of krippendorffsalpha’s usage before concluding in Section 6.2. Situating Krippendorff’s Alpha among statistical proceduresSince Krippendorff’s α𝛼\alpha is defined in terms of discrepancies (Krippendorff,, 2013), at first glance one might conclude, erroneously, that α𝛼\alpha is a measure of dis-agreement and so answers the wrong question. In Sections 2.1–2.3 we will show, by examining Krippendorff’s α𝛼\alpha’s place among statistical procedures, that α𝛼\alpha is, in fact, a sensible measure of agreement. Also, establishing a context for α𝛼\alpha may help practitioners make educated decisions regarding α𝛼\alpha’s use.The UML class diagram (Fowler et al.,, 2004) shown below in Figure 1 provides a conceptual roadmap for our development.
