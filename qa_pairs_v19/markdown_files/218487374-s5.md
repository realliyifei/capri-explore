## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

In natural language processing (NLP), text representation is crucial for transforming unstructured text into structured formats that machine learning (ML) models can work with effectively. Several common methods for text representation include classical techniques and modern state-of-the-art models.

1. **Classical Methods**: Early text representation methods primarily relied on statistical modeling and rule-based systems. Techniques such as bag-of-words (BoW) and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) were prevalent. These methods typically began with feature extraction through hand-crafted techniques, which were often domain-dependent and required deep domain knowledge to implement effectively [3][4]. For instance, traditional classifiers like Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees utilized these methods to represent textual data statically, focusing on the frequency and presence of words without considering word order or semantic relationships [3].

2. **Word Embeddings**: To overcome the limitations of classical methods, word embeddings emerged as a major advancement. Models such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText provide dense vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships based on context. These embeddings allow similar words to have similar representations in the vector space, thus facilitating a better understanding of text [1][2]. Word embeddings are computed from large corpora, leveraging the context in which words appear, and thus provide a more nuanced representation compared to traditional models.

3. **Contextualized Representations**: Further advancements led to the development of contextualized word embeddings, notably through transformer-based models like BERT and GPT. These models represent words in the context of adjacent words, which significantly enhances their ability to capture word meaning that varies with context [1]. For example, they can discern the meaning of "bank" based on whether it is associated with money or a river.

4. **Deep Learning Models**: Modern NLP heavily leverages deep learning architectures for text representation. These models can automatically derive features from text data while being trained on large datasets, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features [5]. This enhances the ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within the textual data, making them suitable for various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, text summarization, and question answering [4][5].

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Different text representation methods are evaluated based on their performance in specific tasks and how well they encode the semantic information of the text. Common evaluation metrics for these models include accuracy, F1 score, and others that depend on the specific application of NLP being considered [1].

In conclusion, the shift from classical statistical models to more sophisticated word embeddings and deep learning techniques has transformed how textual information is processed in NLP. While classical methods provide a baseline, modern representation models offer substantial improvements in expressing the semantic richness inherent in natural language, catering effectively to the diverse applications of NLP [3][5].

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: questions [2], summarization [3], digital assistants [4]. Besides these tasks, text classification, which assigns a document to a specific category, is one of the main areas in which NLP is employed. Categorizing customer requests, sorting emails or papers, understanding user ideas in social media, exploring trends, and topic labelling for documents are some of the application areas of text classification [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In all these tasks, NLP builds a bridge between linguistic structure and computer-based analysis to cover the underlying conceptual content of large amounts of text data.NLP, or text processing, is a rapidly evolving area of computer science. The traditional text analysis methods depend on rule-based statistical modeling [10], such as Naïve Bayes, K-nearest, Decision Trees. They use hand-crafted feature engineering techniques to solve problems. Furthermore, classical algorithms are largely domain-dependent; it is important to have domain knowledge of the document
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: adjective, adverb and so on (Part of Speech Tagging). At the semantic level, each word is analyzed to get the meaningful representation of the sentence. Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Information Extraction (IE) refers to the use of computational methods to identify relevant pieces of information in document generated for human use and convert this information into a representation suitable for computer based storage, processing, and retrieval (Wimalasuriya and Dua, 2010). The input to IE system is a collection of documents (email, web pages, news groups, news articles, business reports, research papers, blogs, resumes,

The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their
