## I don't know?: False

In NLP, various methods for text representation have evolved, each with distinct characteristics in how they process textual information. These methods range from classical approaches to modern state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

1. **Classical Methods**: Traditional text representation techniques often employ statistical modeling methods like Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and rule-based methods. These approaches create a sparse matrix representation of the text data where each unique word or token becomes a feature in the model. While these methods are straightforward and interpretable, they often ignore the semantic relationships between words and can lead to a loss of contextual meaning and linguistic structure. For example, BoW treats words as isolated entities without consideration for their order or relationships, possibly limiting the accuracy of tasks such as sentiment analysis or context-based understanding [1] [4].

2. **Word Embeddings**: With the advent of machine learning techniques, more sophisticated methods such as word embeddings have emerged. These methods, including Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, map words to dense vector representations. Each word is represented in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are placed closer together. This allows for capturing semantic relationships effectively, enhancing tasks like word analogy or similarity comparison. Word embeddings rely on contexts derived from large corpuses of text to inform the structure of these vectors, making them more informative than classical bag-of-words representations [1] [2].

3. **SOTA Language Models**: The latest developments in NLP include transformer-based models such as BERT, GPT, and their derivatives. These models greatly improve upon earlier embeddings by employing attention mechanisms that provide context-sensitive representations of entire sequences rather than individual words. By doing so, they can capture nuanced meanings based on the surrounding words in a sentence, making them exceptionally powerful for a range of tasks, from text classification to question answering and summarization. These models can process large volumes of text and maintain contextual integrity while transforming it into vector representations that can be used effectively in downstream tasks [1] [3] [4].

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The choice of text representation method often affects how well an NLP model performs on various evaluation metrics, which assess factors like accuracy, precision, and recall. As newer methods (like deep learning models) become more prevalent, they require more complex evaluation criteria depending on the task at hand [5].

In conclusion, while classical methods provide a foundation for text representation, modern embeddings and transformer-based language models represent significant advancements. Each method varies in its ability to preserve semantic meaning and contextual understanding, which are crucial for effective NLP applications. Understanding these differences helps inform the selection of appropriate models for different NLP tasks, enhancing the overall efficacy of text processing in various applications.

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: questions [2], summarization [3], digital assistants [4]. Besides these tasks, text classification, which assigns a document to a specific category, is one of the main areas in which NLP is employed. Categorizing customer requests, sorting emails or papers, understanding user ideas in social media, exploring trends, and topic labelling for documents are some of the application areas of text classification [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In all these tasks, NLP builds a bridge between linguistic structure and computer-based analysis to cover the underlying conceptual content of large amounts of text data.NLP, or text processing, is a rapidly evolving area of computer science. The traditional text analysis methods depend on rule-based statistical modeling [10], such as Naïve Bayes, K-nearest, Decision Trees. They use hand-crafted feature engineering techniques to solve problems. Furthermore, classical algorithms are largely domain-dependent; it is important to have domain knowledge of the document

Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Information Extraction (IE) refers to the use of computational methods to identify relevant pieces of information in document generated for human use and convert this information into a representation suitable for computer based storage, processing, and retrieval (Wimalasuriya and Dua, 2010). The input to IE system is a collection of documents (email, web pages, news groups, news articles, business reports, research papers, blogs, resumes,
