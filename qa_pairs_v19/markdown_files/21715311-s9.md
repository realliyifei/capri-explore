## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The manual evaluation of synsets in automatically constructed WordNets faces several challenges and employs specific methods to ensure quality. 

One of the primary challenges is the inherent complexity and variability in synset construction. The traditional qualitative assessment relies heavily on human judgment, which can vary widely depending on the annotator's understanding of semantic relationships. For instance, a synset may contain words that are partially or not related at all. In a manual evaluation, a synset containing words like {‘hard’, ‘difficult’, ‘challenging’, ‘large’, ‘blue’} might receive a low score due to the inclusion of irrelevant words, exemplifying the difficulty in consistently scoring the relevance among synonyms and non-synonyms [3]. Synsets that consist of more than 10 senses are often labeled as low-quality (score of 0), reflecting the notion that quality diminishes significantly with increased complexity, as observed in the scoring system [3].

Another significant challenge is the high cost of the manual evaluation process itself. Given that creating and updating a WordNet is resource-intensive, many existing WordNet projects are not continually updated, leading to the possibility of outdated or incomplete sense inventories. For instance, FilWordNet documents only 15,929 word senses due to the challenges of resource allocation for ongoing maintenance and updates [4]. This limited scope hinders the effectiveness of the manually evaluated synsets, as the richness and dynamic nature of language evolve over time.

To tackle these challenges, specific methodologies are utilized during the evaluation phase. A common method involves scoring synsets based on the percentage of correct senses they encompass. This scoring allows a systematic approach to assess the quality of synsets based on quantifiable metrics. For example, if a synset is designated {‘big’, ‘large’}, it receives a maximum score of 1.0, indicating that all included terms are synonyms. Conversely, a more complex synset may receive a lower score due to irrelevant terms [3]. This structured scoring methodology helps streamline the evaluation process and maintain consistency across different evaluators.

Moreover, advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are being leveraged to enhance the efficiency of synset generation and evaluation. The study discussed proposes methods like automatic generation of sense and synset inventories using unlabeled corpora and sentence embeddings, which require no human supervision during the initial generation [4]. By employing these automated techniques, the reliance on manual evaluation can potentially be reduced, thereby alleviating some of the resource burdens while still enabling high-quality synset induction.

In summary, challenges in manual synset evaluation mainly revolve around variability in human judgment, high resource costs, and maintenance issues. Employed methodologies aim to standardize scores and incorporate advancements in NLP to automate and enhance the synset evaluation process, facilitating more efficient construction and updating of WordNets.

There is a trade-off between quality and cost with merge approach producing higher quality wordnets at a high cost and with expansion approach producing relatively lower quality but at a significantly lower cost Bhattacharyya (2010). Sense inventory and synsets are one of the core components of a wordnet and the focus of this paper. Different approaches to induce these components will be discussed in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.2.1.1 Synset InductionAccording to the recent survey paper on automatically constructed wordnets by Neale (2018), most works follow the expansion approach which uses a reference wordnet (usually PWN) and a lexical
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: (see Figure 5). The top two most frequent type of correct synset is "entirely new synsets" (19.7%) and "has new correct word/s" (9.6%), followed by "has missing correct word/s" (5.0%), "perfect match" (2.8%), and "has incorrect word/s" (2.6%). The top two most frequent type relates to inducing new synsets which indicates the potential of our approach in the discovery of synsets in an unsupervised manner.Figure 5: Types of correct synsets. The top two most frequent types shows the potential of our approach in synset discovery.Overall, the synset evaluation demonstrates the potential of our approach to synset induction which could greatly remedy the inefficiencies in the pure manual process of constructing a wordnet.6 Conclusions and Future WorkIn this work, we proposed (1) N-STEP clustering of sentence embeddings for word sense induction and (2) clustering of sense embeddings or centroids for synset induction. Both can be used towards automatic construction of a wordnet.
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: from FilWordNet synsets.5.2.2 Manual Synset EvaluationTo give a better assessment of synset quality that is independent from FilWordNet synsets, a human evaluation is needed. This was done by scoring the synsets with the percentage of correct senses in the synset. For example, given A = {’big’, ’large’}, it would be labeled with a score of 1.0. On the other hand, given B = {’hard’, ’difficult’, ’challenging’, ’large’, ’blue’}, it would be labeled with a score of 0.60 as three out of the five words (’hard’, ’difficult’, ’challenging’) are synonyms while the other words are irrelevant. To simplify the annotation, synsets with more than 10 senses were labelled as 0 since most FilWordNet synsets only contains 1 to 4 words inside the set. In addition, synsets that contain only 2 senses can only be labeled as 1 or 0.Figure 4: Frequency distribution of human scores from manual synset evaluation.Figure 4 shows the distribution of scores made by humans. The extreme values of 1.0

One probable reason for FilWordNet not being updated is the expensive cost of manually creating and updating a wordnet in terms of time and resources.Advancements in NLP can be leveraged to make wordnet construction more efficient. In this study, we propose a method for automatic generation of sense inventory and synset inventory, remedying the inefficiencies in the pure manual process. Our approach only requires an unlabeled corpus and a sentence embeddings-based language model. Human supervision is not required during the generation process. Our technique is language-agnostic, but for this work, we use Filipino as a case study to produce sense inventories and synset inventories, which are among the core components of a wordnet.2 Related Work2.1 Automatic Wordnet ConstructionAccording to Vossen (1998), wordnets are typically built using two approaches: (1) the merge approach, where lexicographers

As these corpora are not easily available, two strategies have been used:–Machine translation of sense-tagged corpora–By automatic sense-tagging of the English part of available English-target language parallel corpora.The WN-Toolkit has been successfully use to enlarge other wordnets, as for example the Croatian wordnet [26].The future development of this toolkit is oriented to the creation of reliable alignments between wordnets and Wikipedia, Wiktionary and Omegawiki. These alignments will allow the creation of new wordnets and the expansion of existing ones.4.5 UKB: Graph Based Word Sense Disambiguation and SimilarityOne of the most well-known Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tool is UKB [2], which is is a collection of programs for performing graph-based WDS. Using pre-existing knowledge bases (KB) like wordnets in MCR, UKB applies random walks, e.g.
