## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The manual evaluation of synsets in automatically-constructed WordNets faces several challenges and involves specific methods. 

### Challenges:

1. **Quality vs. Cost Trade-off**: One of the primary challenges encountered in the construction of WordNets is the trade-off between quality and cost. The merge approach, which involves manual construction by lexicographers, tends to yield higher quality WordNets, but this comes at a higher cost. In contrast, the expansion approach, which utilizes an existing reference WordNet as a guide, produces lower quality resources at a significantly reduced cost [3]. This necessitates a careful balancing act for researchers aiming to produce viable language resources.

2. **Language Diversity and Untranslatability**: Evaluating synsets also requires addressing complexities arising from language diversity and the concept of untranslatability, where certain ideas or terms do not have equivalent representations in other languages. For instance, expanding the structure of WordNets to incorporate lexical gaps, which denote untranslatable concepts, presents a unique challenge that requires expertise in both the source and target languages [1].

3. **Expertise Requirement**: The manual evaluation often relies on experts, which can be a limiting factor, particularly for low-resourced languages. Engaging skilled annotators or experts, especially for languages with fewer available resources, can be difficult. Furthermore, ensuring that these expert evaluations are both valid and comprehensive adds another layer of complexity [4] [5].

4. **Error Correction**: Another challenge lies in the need for error correction in synsets. Systems like SloWCrowd have been put in place to tackle this by utilizing crowdsourcing, but ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the corrections provided by non-experts can be problematic [4]. 

### Methods:

1. **Expert-Based Methodologies**: A common method employed in the manual evaluation of synsets is the use of expert-based methodologies. For example, Freihat et al. (2024) utilized two translators and an Arabic language expert to enhance the quality of the Arabic WordNet, resulting in a version that included corrections and newly identified synsets [1]. This process emphasizes the importance of incorporating expert input to achieve more reliable wordnet structures.

2. **Crowdsourcing**: Crowdsourcing is another prevalent method for improving synsets in WordNets. Platforms like SloWCrowd allow various participants, including native speakers, to contribute by adding missing words or validating synsets. This method harnesses the collective knowledge of a larger community while addressing the challenges of low-resourced languages [4] [5]. Additionally, employing models that utilize platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk allows for broader participation in tasks like word sense acquisition, aiding the manual evaluation process [5].

3. **Comparative Dataset Analysis**: Some innovative evaluation approaches involve comparing datasets from different languages within the same semantic domain. This method does not depend on English references and allows for a more nuanced evaluation of synsets by analyzing them in a relevant cross-linguistic context [4].

In conclusion, while the manual evaluation of synsets in automatically constructed WordNets involves various challenges such as balancing quality and cost, addressing language diversity, and ensuring expert involvement, methods like expert-based strategies, crowdsourcing, and comparative dataset analysis provide viable avenues for enhancing the quality and comprehensiveness of these linguistic resources.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: For example, in Freihat et al. (2024), we adopted a language expert-based methodology involving two translators and an Arabic language expert to improve the quality of the Arabic wordnet. This approach addressed multiple aspects of lexico-semantic resource quality (Khalilia et al., 2021) by adding missing information and correcting errors, with a focus on handling language diversity and untranslatability. Specifically, we expanded the structure of the wordnet to include phrasets, which provide approximate phrase-level translations, and lexical gaps, representing untranslatable concepts.Our methodology was validated on the Arabic wordnet, resulting in AWN V3, which includes 9,576 synsets, 236 gaps, and 701 phrasets.Similarly, Bella et al. (2020) applied the expert-sourced expansion methodology in the development of the Scottish Gaelic wordnet. A total of 10,583 English synsets from the Princeton WordNet were translated and validated by Gaelic language experts, and then merged with

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: of a wordnet.2 Related Work2.1 Automatic Wordnet ConstructionAccording to Vossen (1998), wordnets are typically built using two approaches: (1) the merge approach, where lexicographers manually construct the wordnet, and (2) the expansion approach, which utilizes an existing reference wordnet as a guide in constructing the new wordnet. There is a trade-off between quality and cost with merge approach producing higher quality wordnets at a high cost and with expansion approach producing relatively lower quality but at a significantly lower cost Bhattacharyya (2010). Sense inventory and synsets are one of the core components of a wordnet and the focus of this paper. Different approaches to induce these components will be discussed in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.2.1.1 Synset InductionAccording to the recent survey paper on automatically constructed wordnets by Neale (2018), most works follow the expansion approach which uses a reference wordnet (usually PWN) and a lexical

SloWCrowd, a crowdsourcing platform introduced by Fišer et al. (2014), addresses error correction in the Slovene wordnet (Gantar and Krek, 2011) using PWN synsets as a reference. Čibej and Arhar Holdt (2019) conducted crowdsourcing tasks to clean the Thesaurus of Modern Slovene, recruiting six workers on PyBossa777https://pybossa.com/ to judge the usefulness of synonym pairs. Nair (2022) presented a crowdsourcing method to enhance Malayalam wordnet using Google Forms integrated into a mobile application, referencing PWN.Our approach differs from the previous efforts in a number of ways:•We select skilled annotators via inter-rater agreement.•We do not depend on English references; instead, we compare datasets from any two languages in the same semantic domain.•We validate

Biemann and Nygaard (2010) showcased a method for generating a sense inventory from scratch, employing annotators via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)666https://www.mturk.com/ to perform word sense acquisition tasks for English. El-Haj et al. (2015) recruited annotators on AMT to construct the Essex Arabic Summaries Corpus (EASC), resulting in 2,360 sentences and 41,493 words in Jordanian and Gulf Arabic.Manerkar et al. (2022) created the “Konkani Shabdarth” crowdsourcing website to enhance the Konkani wordnet’s content quality. The platform, hosted on the Goa University website, offers two roles: players, including Konkani speakers like students and faculty members, who add missing words to synsets, and experts, such as aspiring authors and writers, who validate synsets.
