## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Dialogue acts play a crucial role in enhancing abstractive meeting summarization, particularly in contexts involving decisions. They facilitate better comprehension of the structure and intent behind utterances in discussions, which is essential for accurately capturing the essence of dialogues and ensuring that summaries are coherent and informative.

In the realm of meeting summarization, dialogue acts refer to the distinct functions that each part of the dialogue serves, such as questioning, proposing, asserting, and providing feedback. These acts help delineate the various roles participants play within a conversation, which can significantly influence the outcome of discussions and decisions made during meetings. Recognizing whether a speaker is taking the initiative, responding, or providing feedback contributes a nuanced understanding of the dynamics at play in a dialogue, enabling a summary to accurately reflect the decision-making process [1][4].

Moreover, incorporating dialogue acts into summarization models allows algorithms to move beyond simply extracting literal information from transcripts. Traditional methods that rely solely on text can overlook the relational and interactional dynamics that are often communicated through dialogue acts. By integrating information about these acts, researchers can better model conversations, thus enhancing the quality of the summaries produced. The substantial variability inherent in meeting discussions, characterized by different participants and contextual shifts, can be better navigated through the lens of dialogue acts [1][2][3].

For instance, the application of dialogue act recognition in summarization efforts can help identify key moments where decisions are made or pivotal opinions are expressed, leading to a summary that highlights these critical aspects rather than providing a flat, disengaged recounting of the dialogue. As mentioned, some summarization methods have begun to incorporate auxiliary information, such as dialogue acts and discourse structures, to improve modeling. This approach has been recognized as beneficial for conveying the subtleties of discussions more effectively [1][2].

Furthermore, the challenges faced in meeting summarization, including managing extensive transcripts and understanding inter-speaker relations, can be mitigated by utilizing information about dialogue acts. Newer methodologies in NLP are increasingly leveraging advanced techniques, such as transfer learning and hierarchical modeling, to address these challenges. Such strategies can utilize data gathered from dialogue act patterns, thereby leading to improvements in how summaries are generated, particularly when it comes to comprehending and reporting on decisions made during meetings [1][5].

In summary, the integration of dialogue acts into abstractive meeting summarization enhances the understanding of interactional elements within conversations. By guiding how summarization models process and present information, dialogue acts contribute significantly to capturing the nuances of decision-making processes within meetings, ultimately leading to more effective and informative summaries [1][2][4][5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: years witness a growing trend of abstractive meeting summarization methods Shang et al. (2018).With the development of neural networks, many works have explored the application of deep learning in meeting the summarization task and have achieved remarkable success Zhu et al. (2020).Although deep learning-based methods have strong modeling abilities, taking only literal information into consideration is not sufficient.This is because there are diverse interactive signals among meeting utterances and the long meeting transcripts further pose challenges to traditional sequence-to-sequence models.To this end, some works devote efforts to incorporate auxiliary information for better modeling meetings, such as dialogue discourse Feng et al. (2021b), dialogue acts Goo and Chen (2018) and domain terminologies Koay et al. (2020).Besides, several strategies are carefully devised to handle long meeting transcripts, including hierarchical modeling strategy Zhu et al. (2020), sliding window
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: we discuss the possible implications of the recently explored large language models and conclude that despite a potential shift in relevance and difficulty, our described challenge taxonomy remains relevant.1 IntroductionFigure 1: Overview of the big six challenges in dialogue summarization, a short description of the challenges, and the estimation of their progress derived from related sub-challenges. Green means mostly mitigated, orange means good progress, and red stands for marked challenges still exist.Abstractive dialogue summarization, a task within Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text summarization, entails condensing key information from conversations into succinct and coherent summaries (?).This sub-field of text summarization is gaining prominenceand is relevant for various real-world scenarios, including customer service (e.g., social media (?) and e-commerce (?)), healthcare (?), daily life (?), meetings (?), and open-domain conversations (e.g.,
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: of the most important and challenging problems in NLP. Among the different forms the text to be summarized could take, dialogues have been serving as a critical part of human-human and human-machine interaction. There has been significant progress made in dialogue summarization these days Goo and Chen (2018); Liu et al. (2019b); Chen and Yang (2020).However, they generally follow the prevalent paradigm of fine-tuning generative pretrained language models to perform downstream tasks, which inevitably makes them heavily rely on massive human-written golden dialogue summaries. In real-world scenarios, the availability of massive supervised data is not always guaranteed, as the data scarcity problem often occurs due to the high annotation cost that is normally required for acquiring large-scale high-quality dialogue summaries Bražinskas et al. (2020).In existing works, one common way to tackle the data scarcity problem is to perform transfer learning by leveraging off-the-shelf
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: In the last study, these results were further improved to 80.34% and 82.88% by applying an instance-based learning approach, namely k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), to the reduced semantic spaces computed by LSA. However, in both cases, the improvements were achieved using features concerning the dialog game, that is, the generic intention of the whole dialog, and whether the speaker is taking initiative or replying or providing feedback to the other speaker. Although in general the dialog game is known, there are also cases in which a dialog system is not aware of it. Furthermore, identifying whether a speaker is taking initiative, replying, or providing feedback can be seen as a simplification of the dialog act recognition task. Thus, it is not fair to use that information if it is not obtained automatically as well. Finally, the corpus was also explored in domain adaptation experiments for dialog act classification using a reduced set of classes (Margolis et al.,

[5]:  Passage ID 5: is highly-costing or even intractable Chen and Yang (2021a).To mitigate these challenges, researchers draw on successful experiences from the study of dialogue systems and natural language generation techniques and put their efforts on solving this challenging task, which result in nearly 100 papers covering various domains being published over the past 5 years.To review the current progress and help new researchers get into the field quickly, we present this first survey for dialogue summarization.As the preliminary, we quickly overview the recent progress in general summarization and capture several key time points and key techniques, this serves as a strong background before we dive into the dialogue summarization (see §2).As the core content, we summarize existing works according to the domain of dialogue, mainly covering the meeting, chat, email thread, customer service and medical dialogue.For each type of dialogue, we thoroughly go through related research works, organize
