## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not contain any information specifically about back-translation, its adaptation, or its evaluation in the context of grammatical error correction tasks. The passages focus on quality assurance systems, evaluation methods in natural language processing, and some application areas like question answering, but do not mention anything related to back-translation or grammatical error correction. Thus, the context is insufficient to provide an answer to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: or search engine. In the last decades, many QA systems have been proposed to address the requirements of different question-answering tasks. Furthermore, many error scores have been introduced, e.g., based on n-gram matching, word embeddings, or contextual embeddings to measure the performance of a QA system. This survey attempts to provide a systematic overview of the general framework of QA, QA paradigms, benchmark datasets, and assessment techniques for a quantitative evaluation of QA systems. The latter is particularly important because not only is the construction of a QA system complex but also its evaluation. We hypothesize that a reason, therefore, is that the quantitative formalization of human judgment is an open problem.keywords: Natural Language Processing, Question Answering, Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence

In descending order of frequency, specific tasks include summarization (42), dialogue generation(36), question answering (34), machine translation (26), story generation (20), image captioning (9), etc. These guidelines are collected from high-quality NLP conferences ACL, EMNLP and NAACL over the past three years (2020-2022). Apart from machine translation that cover a range of language pairs like English-French, English-Japanese, Chinese -English, English-German, English-Spanish, and English-Russian, most of the tasks primarily focus on the English language. Additionally, we have gathered information on the reported inter-annotator agreement, revealing a general inverse relationship between the number of identified vulnerabilities and the

Such evaluations are essential to ensure these models meet quality standards, align with human expectations, and maintain safety and reliability in various applications (Chang et al., 2024).Conventional automated metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) have long been employed to evaluate the performance of model generated text. However, these metrics primarily focus on surface-form similarity and often fail to account for semantically equivalent lexical and compositional diversity (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020). Moreover, automated metrics struggle in evaluating open-ended generation or free-form text, where a wide range of acceptable outputs exists. This limitation becomes particularly evident when assessing instruction-tuned chat models, which tend
