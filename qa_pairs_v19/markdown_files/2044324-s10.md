## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets exhibit several key characteristics and contents that define the task of VQA, a field that intersects computer vision and natural language processing. 

Firstly, VQA datasets consist of pairs of images and text-based questions. The questions typically require not only recognition of visual elements in the images but also the incorporation of external knowledge and reasoning to arrive at an answer. For instance, some questions pertain to logical reasoning that goes beyond what is visually present in the image, illustrating the necessity for external knowledge resources [1]. This characteristic is part of what makes VQA a challenging problem, as it requires the algorithm to understand context and apply knowledge beyond mere image recognition.

Second, VQA encompasses a diverse array of sub-problems which can be categorized into object recognition (identifying objects in an image), object detection (locating objects), attribute classification (determining properties like color), scene classification (understanding the type of environment), and even reasoning about spatial relationships among objects [5]. This range indicates that the datasets need to be designed to facilitate the training of models that can handle a broad set of inquiries. For example, questions might ask for counting specifics or interrogate the reasons behind actions depicted in the image, requiring advanced reasoning capabilities [5].

Thirdly, the evolution of VQA datasets has expanded from traditional natural images to include synthetic images, videos, and 3D environments, showcasing a broadening scope over time [4]. Such diversity enhances the dataset's ability to train models under varied conditions and settings, potentially leading to improvements in model performance in real-world applications.

Moreover, the existing VQA datasets often consist of annotations that help to elucidate the relationship between images and the questions asked. Crowd-sourcing techniques have been instrumental in generating large-scale datasets, as human participants contribute by annotating images with questions and corresponding answers, thereby ensuring a rich and representative dataset [3].

Additionally, while traditional VQA systems relied on feature extraction methods, the introduction of large pre-trained networks and vision-language pre-training (VLP) techniques marks a significant progression in the development of VQA models. This shift indicates an ongoing evolution in the methodologies employed to approach the challenges inherent in VQA datasets [4].

Lastly, various challenges remain in effectively utilizing VQA datasets, particularly regarding the need for comprehensive surveys that can catalogue existing limitations and future opportunities for the development of new algorithms and evaluation metrics [2]. This makes the field quite dynamic, as researchers continue to explore the intricacies and potential open problems within VQA datasets.

In summary, VQA datasets are characterized by their complex questions requiring reasoning and integration of external knowledge, a wide-ranging set of sub-problems, an evolving nature incorporating diverse forms of media, annotations generated through crowd-sourcing, and ongoing challenges that target improvements in evaluation and methodology.

In this example, the visual content of the image is not sufficient to answer the question. A set of facts about teddy bears makes the connection between teddy bear and the American president, which enables answering the question.The field of Visual Question Answering (VQA) has made amazing strides in recent years, achieving record numbers on standard VQA datasets [24, 4, 12, 21]. As originally conceived, VQA is not only a fertile ground for vision and language research, but is also a proxy to evaluate AI models for the task of open-ended scene understanding. In its ideal form, VQA would require not only visual recognition, but also logical reasoning and incorporating knowledge about the world. However, current VQA datasets (e.g., [3, 54]) are focused mainly on recognition, and most

In VQA, an algorithm needs to answer text-based questions about images. Since the release of the first VQA dataset in 2014, additional datasets have been released and many algorithms have been proposed. In this review, we critically examine the current state of VQA in terms of problem formulation, existing datasets, evaluation metrics, and algorithms. In particular, we discuss the limitations of current datasets with regard to their ability to properly train and assess VQA
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: sites, especially image-sharing websites, has led to abundant image data. Many efficient methods have been developed to extract and collect this data, making large-scale image datasets possible. Crowd-sourcing has also made it possible to quickly utilize human workers to perform captioning, annotation, etc. The same is true for natural language processing, another field to which VQA belongs. Significant work has been done in tasks such as language modeling, word and sentence representation, POS(Parts of speech) tagging, sentiment analysis, textual question answering, etc.The problem of VQA is that given any image and any natural language question about that image, a correct natural language answer has to be produced.(a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1: Examples of VQA from the VQA-v2 dataset. Figure from [42]Despite this simple description, VQA encompasses a lot of sub-problems such as:•Object recognition: What is behind the chair?•Object detection:
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: answers to questions on any visual input. Over time, the scope of VQA has expanded from datasets focusing on an extensive collection of natural images to datasets featuring synthetic images, video, 3D environments, and various other visual inputs. The emergence of large pre-trained networks has shifted the early VQA approaches relying on feature extraction and fusion schemes to vision language pre-training (VLP) techniques. However, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that encompass both traditional VQA architectures and contemporary VLP-based methods. Furthermore, the VLP challenges in the lens of VQA haven't been thoroughly explored, leaving room for potential open problems to emerge. Our work presents a survey in the domain of VQA that delves into the intricacies of VQA datasets and methods over the field's history, introduces a detailed taxonomy to categorize the facets of VQA, and highlights the recent trends, challenges, and scopes for improvement. We further generalize VQA
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a computer vision task where a system is given a text-based question about an image, and it must infer the answer. Questions can be arbitrary and they encompass many sub-problems in computer vision, e.g.,•Object recognition - What is in the image?•Object detection - Are there any cats in the image?•Attribute classification - What color is the cat?•Scene classification - Is it sunny?•Counting - How many cats are in the image?Beyond these, there are many more complex questions that can be asked, such as questions about the spatial relationships among objects (What is between the cat and the sofa?) and common sense reasoning questions (Why is the the girl crying?). A robust VQA system must be capable of solving a wide range of classical computer vision tasks as well as needing the ability to reason about images.There are many potential applications for VQA. The most immediate is as an aid to blind and visually impaired
