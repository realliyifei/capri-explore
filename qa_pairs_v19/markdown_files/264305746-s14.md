## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

In the context of finance, sentiment is defined as the extraction of sentiments or opinions expressed in textual data, which may include a range of emotional tones from positive to negative [4]. More specifically, sentiment analysis involves classifying text, particularly financial communication, into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral [2].

One common assumption made in studies of sentiment analysis in finance is that the sentiment reflected in textual data accurately represents the true opinions held by the authors, and by extension, the broader market sentiment [3]. This assumption is critical because it underlies many trading decisions made on the basis of sentiment data. However, relying on this assumption can be problematic—if the sentiment expressed in texts does not genuinely reflect underlying market feelings, it can lead to misguided investment strategies.

Another important consideration is the presence of biases in the sentiment expressed, especially when using self-labeled data. For example, some research suggests that day traders exhibit biases in their sentiment labeling, particularly when self-disclosed "Hold" labels are often interpreted as positive, when they may actually represent a neutral stance [3]. This raises concerns about the reliability of sentiment indicators sourced from platforms like StockTwits.

Overall, while sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in identifying market trends and informing investment decisions, both the nature of the financial text and the biases inherent in its interpretation must be understood and factored into analyses to ensure their accuracy and relevance [1] [5].

[1]:  Passage ID 1: and stock performance.Index Terms: large language model, sentiment analysis, bias, financial text miningI IntroductionWith the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technology, financial and economic text mining—such as analyzing financial statements, analyst reports, social media texts and newspaper articles—has become an essential tool for investment decisions, understanding economic trends, and improving operational efficiency in financial institutions[1, 2].In particular, sentiment analysis of financial and economic text data has played a crucial role in understanding investor decision-making and market trends.The use of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis has raised expectations for higher quality sentiment evaluation [3, 4].However, since financial and investment decisions typically have significant risk, both accuracy and reliability are required in predictions [5, 6].Therefore, ensuring that LLM outputs are accurate and trustworthy
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: the last decade (Guo et al., 2016).The principal research interest for this thesis is the polarity analysis, which is classifying text as positive, negative or neutral, in a specific domain. It requires to address two challenges: 1) The most sophisticated classification methods that make use of neural nets require vast amounts of labeled data and labeling financial text snippets requires costly expertise. 2) The sentiment analysis models trained on general corpora are not suited to the task, because financial texts have a specialized language with unique vocabulary and have a tendency to use vague expressions instead of easily-identified negative/positive words.Using carefully crafted financial sentiment lexicons such as Loughran and McDonald (2011) (Loughran andMcdonald, 2011) may seem a solution because they incorporate existing financial knowledge into textual analysis. However, they are based on ”word counting” methods, which come short in analyzing deeper semantic meaning
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: need to reduce the scope of information is made by [9], where the common misclassification of sentiment in financial texts was the motivation for constructing a sentiment dictionary specifically tuned to language used in financial literature.A major assumption made in all related work that we are familiar with, is that the sentiment expressed in text reflects the true opinions held by the authors, and by extension the true market sentiment. The implications of such an assumption could result in trading decisions being based on information not representative of the true underlying market sentiment. Some works choose to use self-labelled data such as messages posted on StockTwits, a financial communication platform where users can label their posts as ‘bullish’ or ‘bearish’. However there is evidence of strong biases present in the recommendations made by day traders, in particular with self-disclosed Hold labels actually conveying a positive sentiment rather than neutral [18]. This

Related LiteratureThis section describes previous research conducted on sentiment analysis in finance (2.1) and text classification using pre-trained language models (2.2).2.1. Sentiment analysis in financeSentiment analysis is the task of extracting sentiments or opinions of people from written language (Liu, 2012). We can divide the recent efforts into two groups: 1) Machine learning methods with features extracted from text with ”word counting” (Agarwal andMittal, 2016; Whitelawet al., 2005; Martineau andFinin, 2009; Tripathyet al., 2016), 2) Deep learning methods, where text is represented by a sequence of embeddings (Severyn andMoschitti, 2015; Araque et al., 2017; Zhanget al., 2018). The former suffers from inability to represent the semantic information that results from a particular sequence of words, while the latter is often deemed as too ”data-hungry” as it learns a much higher
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: about firms on the sentiment measurement of texts by LLMs.Firstly, we compare the sentiment scores of financial texts by LLMs when the company name is explicitly included in the prompt versus when it is not. We define and quantify company-specific bias as the difference between these scores.Next, we construct an economic model to theoretically evaluate the impact of sentiment bias on investor behavior. This model helps us understand how biased LLM investments, when widespread, can distort stock prices.This implies the potential impact on stock prices if investments driven by biased LLMs become dominant in the future.Finally, we conduct an empirical analysis using Japanese financial text data to examine the relationship between firm-specific sentiment bias, corporate characteristics, and stock performance.Index Terms: large language model, sentiment analysis, bias, financial text miningI IntroductionWith the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technology,
