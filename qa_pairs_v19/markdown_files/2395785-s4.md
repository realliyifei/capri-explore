Dependency trees and phrase structure trees (PSTs) represent syntagmatic relations differently through their structural frameworks and the type of information they emphasize about word relationships.

Dependency trees focus on the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, where each word (except the root) is linked to another word by a directed edge that indicates a dependency. This structure captures the hierarchical relationships and syntactic dependencies between words, displaying them as relation triplets mapped onto a directed graph where words are nodes and grammatical relations are edge labels. This representation is particularly useful in tasks like semantic analysis and grammar checking, as it provides a clear view of how words depend on one another to form coherent meanings [1][3].

In contrast, phrase structure trees (PSTs), sometimes referred to as constituency trees, represent the hierarchical organization of phrases within sentences. In PSTs, sentences are broken down into their constituent parts (like noun phrases and verb phrases), which are further divided into smaller constituents. This tree structure emphasizes the grouping of words into phrases, reflecting how these phrases function syntactically within the sentence. The hierarchical structure of PSTs showcases the nested relationships between phrases, whereas dependency trees highlight direct relationships between individual words [1][4].

Both structures allow linguistic analysis but serve different purposes. While dependency trees excel at illustrating direct syntactic relationships, PSTs provide insights into the phrase-level organization of language. This distinction is crucial for various NLP tasks; for example, recent studies on neural language models like BERT show that these models leverage syntactic structures inferred from both dependency and constituency representations, although they may not always align with traditionally linguistically annotated resources [4][5].

Furthermore, dependency parsing is beneficial because it assigns explicit grammatical roles and relationships to words, which can help in semantic understanding and the construction of embeddings for words based on their syntactical context [3]. On the other hand, the analysis of phrase structure can contribute to understanding the functional roles of different phrases within sentences [1]. 

In conclusion, while both dependency trees and phrase structure trees provide valuable insights into linguistic structures, they represent syntagmatic relations differently: dependency trees emphasize word-to-word relationships and syntactic dependencies, while phrase structure trees prioritize the hierarchical organization and functional groupings of phrases within sentences.

[1]: Passage ID 1: to identifying semantic paraphrases is the use of parsing trees, which compare texts by their underlying tree structures that represent them. Syntactic parsing trees, such as those built using the Penn Treebank dataset [48], are constructed using POS tagging, syntactic bracketing, and disfluency annotation schemes. The Penn Treebank has significantly influenced NLP research, and has been used to train syntactic classifiers for paraphrase identification. For example, in [49], the authors showed that the Penn Treebank can be used to build improved English dependency parsing models, leading to an increase in the quality of paraphrase detection. In [50], the authors combined nùëõn-gram features with syntactic features from the dependency tree to improve paraphrase detection.Another type of parsing tree is based on semantic features, known as semantic parsers. These parsers are designed to construct the meaning behind a given sentence. Most previous research in this area [51, 52, 53] has

(2011). Vanroy et al. (2021) combined dependency relations with word reordering to calculate word cross nodes, called SACr. They also proposed aligned syntactic tree edit distance (ASTrED) which aligns source and target dependency tree and calculate the edit distance between dependency parsed trees. Named entity knowledge is drawn from the literature on named-entity recognition, which seeks to recognize and categorize atomic elements in a text into distinct entity categories, to capture the semantic equivalence of sentences or text fragments (Marsh et al., 1998; Guo et al., 2009). Neural networks is used on translation quality assessment for pair-wise modeling to compare potential translations with a reference and select the best hypothetical translation by combining syntactic and semantic information into Neural
[3]: Passage ID 3: Since dependency parsing trees are good for capturing the words relationship in a sentence, we have also incorporated dependency information to calculate the position-based embedding.4 Dependency Parsing RelationOne of the most widely used techniques to assign syntactic structures to sentences are Parse trees.This is formally known as Syntactic parsing or Dependency parsing. These are formed using some parsing algorithms.This involves extracting a dependency parse of a sentence in such a way that the sentence‚Äôs grammatical structure is captured.This structure describes the grammatical relationship between words of the sentence in form of relation triplets.This relation between pairs of words, these dependencies are mapped onto a directed graph where words become nodes and grammatical relations become edge labels of the graph.Dependency parsing proves beneficial for tasks like Semantic Analysis and Grammar Checking.

Interestingly their results also show that although BERT learns some syntactic information it is not very similar to linguistically annotated resources, and that the impact of performance on downstream NLP tasks achieved by using the syntactic structural information encoded by BERT is comparable, and even superior, to the human-designed syntactic structural information.These studies on BERT have been extended to other BERT-like neural language models. Arps et¬†al. (2022) investigated the extent to which neural language models (namely BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT) implicitly learn syntactic structure. They found that constituency parse trees of sentences can be extracted from distributed representations generated by these language models. Their results show that if the syntactic structure of data is correct then tree structures are extractable even if the data is semantically ill-formed. This suggests that
