## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

Dependency trees and phrase structure trees (PSTs) represent syntagmatic relations and connections in distinct ways, largely based on their structural characteristics and the specifics of the information they convey.

Dependency trees focus on the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, mapping these relationships onto a directed graph where words function as nodes and grammatical relations serve as edge labels. This structure highlights how words depend on one another to contribute to overall sentence meaning, making it particularly beneficial for tasks such as semantic analysis and grammar checking. The relationships are depicted as relation triplets that capture dependencies, emphasizing the role of individual words as they relate to one another in the sentence [3].

On the other hand, phrase structure trees, also known as constituency trees, organize words into hierarchical structures based on syntactic categories and phrases. In this model, sentences are broken down into larger constituents, with syntactic rules governing how words combine to form phrases and sentences. The Penn Treebank dataset is a significant resource in creating these trees, as it employs syntactic parsing employing part-of-speech (POS) tagging and syntactic bracketing [1]. Thus, while dependency trees focus on word-level relationships, phrase structure trees highlight the grammatical structure of phrases and the relationships among these phrases.

Research demonstrates that the choice between these two representations can impact the quality of natural language processing tasks such as paraphrase identification. For example, studies utilizing the Penn Treebank have shown improved accuracy in dependency parsing models through its structured syntax, which is crucial for accurately identifying semantic paraphrases [1]. Additionally, when combined with other features like n-grams, both parsing techniques can enhance paraphrase detection capabilities [1].

While both trees aim to represent syntactic structures, their differing methodologies lead to different aspects of language being highlighted. Dependency trees excel in showing how each word interacts with others, effectively capturing local dependencies, while phrase structure trees provide a broader overview of sentence structure through the organization of phrases, encapsulating how groups of words work together cohesively [3].

In summary, dependency trees represent the grammatical relationships at the word level, emphasizing individual dependencies, whereas phrase structure trees illustrate how words group together into larger syntactic units and constituents, thus representing relations at a more macro level. Both models have their applications and strengths in natural language processing, influencing how tasks such as semantic analysis and paraphrase detection are approached and executed [2] [4].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: to identifying semantic paraphrases is the use of parsing trees, which compare texts by their underlying tree structures that represent them. Syntactic parsing trees, such as those built using the Penn Treebank dataset [48], are constructed using POS tagging, syntactic bracketing, and disfluency annotation schemes. The Penn Treebank has significantly influenced NLP research, and has been used to train syntactic classifiers for paraphrase identification. For example, in [49], the authors showed that the Penn Treebank can be used to build improved English dependency parsing models, leading to an increase in the quality of paraphrase detection. In [50], the authors combined nùëõn-gram features with syntactic features from the dependency tree to improve paraphrase detection.Another type of parsing tree is based on semantic features, known as semantic parsers. These parsers are designed to construct the meaning behind a given sentence. Most previous research in this area [51, 52, 53] has

(2011). Vanroy et al. (2021) combined dependency relations with word reordering to calculate word cross nodes, called SACr. They also proposed aligned syntactic tree edit distance (ASTrED) which aligns source and target dependency tree and calculate the edit distance between dependency parsed trees. Named entity knowledge is drawn from the literature on named-entity recognition, which seeks to recognize and categorize atomic elements in a text into distinct entity categories, to capture the semantic equivalence of sentences or text fragments (Marsh et al., 1998; Guo et al., 2009). Neural networks is used on translation quality assessment for pair-wise modeling to compare potential translations with a reference and select the best hypothetical translation by combining syntactic and semantic information into Neural

[3]:  Passage ID 3: Since dependency parsing trees are good for capturing the words relationship in a sentence, we have also incorporated dependency information to calculate the position-based embedding.4 Dependency Parsing RelationOne of the most widely used techniques to assign syntactic structures to sentences are Parse trees.This is formally known as Syntactic parsing or Dependency parsing. These are formed using some parsing algorithms.This involves extracting a dependency parse of a sentence in such a way that the sentence‚Äôs grammatical structure is captured.This structure describes the grammatical relationship between words of the sentence in form of relation triplets.This relation between pairs of words, these dependencies are mapped onto a directed graph where words become nodes and grammatical relations become edge labels of the graph.Dependency parsing proves beneficial for tasks like Semantic Analysis and Grammar Checking.

Interestingly their results also show that although BERT learns some syntactic information it is not very similar to linguistically annotated resources, and that the impact of performance on downstream NLP tasks achieved by using the syntactic structural information encoded by BERT is comparable, and even superior, to the human-designed syntactic structural information.These studies on BERT have been extended to other BERT-like neural language models. Arps et¬†al. (2022) investigated the extent to which neural language models (namely BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT) implicitly learn syntactic structure. They found that constituency parse trees of sentences can be extracted from distributed representations generated by these language models. Their results show that if the syntactic structure of data is correct then tree structures are extractable even if the data is semantically ill-formed. This suggests that
