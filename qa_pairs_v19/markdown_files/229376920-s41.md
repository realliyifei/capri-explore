## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Prototype editing methods in text style transfer (TST) face several challenges and limitations, primarily centered around content preservation and the complexities of attribute marker retrieval.

One significant challenge is that many prototype editing approaches may inadvertently alter the text content alongside the style. This change in content is identified as a major problem in style transfer, especially when the methods employed modify the text style but do not sufficiently preserve the non-stylistic semantic content. Previous methods using encoder-decoder frameworks have been associated with poor content preservation, which detracts from the overall quality and reliability of the output [1] [4]. 

Further complicating the application of prototype editing techniques is the dependence on effective attribute marker retrieval. If the datasets exhibit a confusion between style and content, this may lead to inaccuracies in extracting the necessary attribute markers. This scenario is especially pertinent when the initial step of attribute marker retrieval fails due to confounding elements, as extracting content words or features that do not pertain to style can result in incorrect outcomes [2] [5]. Additionally, the prototype editing process may struggle when there is minimal lexical overlap between a sentence and its stylistic counterpart. For example, transforming modern English into Shakespearean English presents significant vocabulary differences that can hinder effective retrieval, thereby impacting the success of style transfer [5].

Another concern arises from the methods used in prototype editing. While these techniques could enhance performance on tasks like sentiment modification, where attribute markers are clearly identifiable and the input-output pairs share a common template, they are not universally applicable. Techniques that rely on direct attribute marker manipulation may falter when the characteristics distinguishing different styles are not explicit in the data [2] [5]. 

Moreover, even though recent advancements attempt to improve the situation by employing innovative strategies such as dual reinforcement learning and content extraction mechanisms, these still reveal inadequacies in both performance and robustness across diverse TST tasks. The improvement achieved has not been uniform, indicating ongoing limitations within current methodologies [4].

In conclusion, prototype editing methods in text style transfer encounter significant hurdles related to content preservation, inaccuracies in attribute marker retrieval, and challenges posed by the lexical characteristics of the data involved. These issues highlight the necessity for ongoing research and innovative approaches to enhance the effectiveness of style transfer techniques while maintaining the integrity of the underlying content.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: of the task with minimal changes but matching a different target label. To alleviate expensive human labor, Xing et al. (2020) develop an automatic text editing approach to generate contrast set for aspect-based sentiment analysis. The difference between contrastive text generation and text style transfer is that the former does not require content preservation but mainly aims to construct a slightly textually different input that can result in a change of the ground-truth output, to test the model robustness. So the two tasks are not completely the same, although they have some intersections that might inspire future work, such as aspect-based style transfer suggested in Section 6.1.6.2.3.0.7 Prototype-Based Text Editing.Prototype editing is not unique in TST, but also widely used in other NLP tasks. Knowing the new advances in prototype editing for other tasks can potentially inspire new method innovations in TST. Guu et al. (2018) first proposes the protype editing approach
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: stream of work treats text style transfer as an analogy of unsupervised machine translation Zhang et al. (2018); Lample et al. (2019); Zhao et al. (2019); He et al. (2020) to rephrase a sentence while reducing its stylistic properties Prabhumoye et al. (2018). Beyond the end-to-end training methods, the prototype-based text editing approach also attracts lot of attention Li et al. (2018); Sudhakar et al. (2019); Madaan et al. (2020), in which attribute markers of input sentences are deleted and then replaced by target attribute markers. These techniques have been well studied in the text style transfer community, but have never been evaluated for both privacy and utility preservation in downstream tasks.Shetty et al. (2018) and Xu et al. (2019) make use of adversarial training and evaluate on authorship obfuscation. However, they did not include most recent style transfer methods and predictors based on pretrained language models.3 Multilingual Back-TranslationProblem
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: in other NLP tasks. Knowing the new advances in prototype editing for other tasks can potentially inspire new method innovations in TST. Guu et al. (2018) first proposes the protype editing approach to improve LM by first sampling a lexically similar sentence prototype and then editing it using variational encoder and decoders. This prototype-and-then-edit approach can also be seen in summarization Wang, Quan, and Wang (2019), machine translation Cao and Xiong (2018); Wu, Wang, and Wang (2019); Gu et al. (2018); Zhang et al. (2018a); Bulté and Tezcan (2019), conversation generation Weston, Dinan, and Miller (2018); Cai et al. (2019), code generation Hashimoto et al. (2018), and question answering Lewis et al. (2020). As an extension to the retrieve and edit steps, Hossain, Ghazvininejad, and Zettlemoyer (2020) use an ensemble approach to retrieve a set of relevant prototypes, edit, and finally rerank to pick the best output for machine translation. Such extension can also be
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Although these approaches successfully change the text style, they also change the text content, which is a major problem. Many previous methods [7, 26, 4, 20] formulate the style transfer using the encoder-decoder framework. The encoder maps the text into a style-independent latent representation, and the decoder generates the target text using the latent representation and a style marker. Again, a major issue of these models is poor preservation of non-stylistic semantic content.Content PreservationTo further deal with the above problem, Li et al. [12] first extract content words by deleting phrases, then retrieve new phrases associated with the target attribute, and finally use a neural model to combine these into a final output. Luo et al. [14] employ a dual reinforcement learning framework with two sequence-to-sequence models in two directions, using style classifier and back-transfer reconstruction probability as rewards. Though these works show some improvement, they are
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: to perform well on tasks such as sentiment modification, for which it is easy to identify “attribute markers,” and the input and output sentences share an attribute-independent template.However, prototype editing cannot be applied to all types of style transfer tasks. The first step, attribute marker retrieval, might not work if the datasets have confounded style and contents, because they may lead to wrong extraction of attribute markers, such as some content words or artifacts which can also be used to distinguish the style-specific data.The second step, target attribute retrieval by templates, will fail if there is too little word overlap between a sentence and its counterpart carrying another style.An example is the TST task to “Shakespearize” modern English. There is little lexical overlap between a Shakespearean sentence written in early modern English and its corresponding modern English expression. In such cases, the retrieval step is likely to fail, because there is a
