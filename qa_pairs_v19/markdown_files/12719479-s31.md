## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Annotation schemes like DAMSL (Dialog Act Markup in Several Layers) address the challenges of multi-tag issues in dialogue act tagging primarily through their foundational design that supports multiple labels for single utterances. This multi-label capability is essential for capturing the pragmatic overloading often present in conversations, especially in multi-party, multi-threaded contexts where utterances may serve several functions simultaneously [1][2].

The DAMSL framework made the support of multiple labels a primary objective, which directly mitigates the difficulties associated with annotating utterances that can embody more than one communicative intent. By allowing annotators to assign additional labels when appropriate, DAMSL effectively removes ambiguities that may arise when trying to categorize such utterances into single, often reductive, dialogue acts [5]. This flexibility in annotation reflects the inherent complexity and richness of human conversation, where a single utterance can fulfill varied roles depending on context and speaker intention.

Additionally, the proposed Dependency Dialogue Act (DDA) annotation scheme builds upon the principles established by DAMSL, enhancing the capacity to handle multi-functionality through multi-label annotations and the incorporation of multi-dependency structures [1][2]. The DDA not only maintains this multi-label approach but also aims to resolve the response structure in dialogues, thereby further elucidating the intricate discourse relationships between varied conversational turns. This aspect is pivotal because it not only aids annotators in understanding how different dialogue acts relate to one another but also anchors these acts within their contextual frameworks [1].

Furthermore, many annotation schemes, including DDA, employ a hierarchical taxonomy that presents relationships between dialogue acts, allowing for a more organized understanding of their various functions. This hierarchical arrangement can be useful in classifying and resolving ambiguities present in overlapping dialogue acts, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of dialogue act tagging processes [4]. By mapping different dialogue functions to a more extensive set of categories, they make it easier for computational models to interpret these relations, which is crucial for developing robust natural language processing systems.

Overall, schemes like DAMSL and its adaptations tackle multi-tag issues by emphasizing multi-functionality, contextual dependencies, and hierarchical structures, making them more adaptable and effective for modeling the complexities inherent in human dialogue [2][4][5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: ; li-etal-2021-self .Our proposed Dependency Dialogue Act (DDA) annotation scheme builds upon previous work on discourse annotation by merging different features from existing schemes into a single system that captures a large amount of conversational context while minimizing annotator effort. One of the primary goals is the ability to preserve both rhetorical and response relations between different turns in the utterance.Additionally, we want to embrace the inherent overloading nature of conversations by enabling annotators to select multiple labels per utterance where appropriate. Finally, the DDA scheme anchors the speaker’s intention with context.The goal of this paper is to define the Dependency Dialogue Act (DDA) annotation scheme for discourse analysis and investigate its effectiveness in the context of multi-threaded multi-party conversations. In Section 3, we define the response structure of DDA and present the tagset composed of two class types: Dialog Acts and

Nevertheless, we made two augmentations: first, DDA handles multi-functionality phenomenon with multi-label and multi-dependency; second, DDA resolves the response structure, which not only unveils a deeper discourse structure in conversations but also anchors the dialogue act and discourse relations into context, which is

(1991); Core and Allen (1997); Stolcke et al. (2000a). The corresponding classification task, dialog act tagging, is a crucial component in creating dialog systems, as it allows for a simple way of modeling the user’s communicative intent through text classification. In this paper, we do not make contributions to dialog act tagging, but we use existing work.3.   ApproachIn this section we outline the data, modeling techniques, and evaluation measures used throughout the paper.3.1.   Face Act DataAs discussed in Section 2, we use the face data set developed by Dutt et al. (2020) for our experiments. Wang et al.

Furthermore, the scheme contains a generic dimension and communicative functions, which is suitable for mapping virtually any kind of conversation, both task-based and non task-based. Moreover, its multidimensional aspect and hierarchical taxonomy make it extensible and potentially adaptable to specific conversational sets.2.2 Dialogue Act TaggingThe automatic recognition of Dialogue Acts has been addressed by the literature using various machine learning techniques. In particular DA classification has been modeled both as a sequence labeling problem, using techniques such as HMM [Stolcke et al., 2000], neural networks [Ji et al., 2016, Kumar et al., 2017] or CRF [Quarteroni et al., 2011], and as a multi-class classification problem, using for example SVM [Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010]. Mentioning and comparing all DA classification approaches is
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997), now the most commonly adapted methodology for dialog act annotations, made supporting multiple labels a primary objective in its design. Future annotations of face acts should do the same and the frequency that multiple act utterances were found in our error analysis supports this recommendation.Face acts are an important part of language use, and while Dutt et al. (2020) have made a major contribution, there has been little work with this corpus, and future work will require thinking hard about the data. We hope this paper will allow other researchers to use the corpus in constructive ways while being aware of the nature of the data in more detail. Despite their similarities from a computational perspective, it does not seem to be as simple as lifting the approaches used for dialog acts when modeling face acts.In the future, we plan to develop an annotation which incorporates additional aspects of politeness theory and to label a corpus with in-house
