## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Annotation schemes like DAMSL (Dialogue Act Markup in Several Layers) address the challenges of multi-tag issues in dialogue act tagging by inherently supporting multiple labels within their design. This capability allows for the effective modeling of the pragmatic overloading often present in conversational exchanges, especially in the context of multi-party and multi-threaded dialogues [1] [5].

DAMSL was developed to enhance the flexibility of dialogue act annotations by making the ability to assign multiple labels to utterances a primary objective of its framework. This means that annotators can note various functions that a single utterance may serve, thereby reflecting the complexities of human communication where one statement can fulfill multiple roles [5]. The recognition of multi-functionality, or pragmatic overloading, has been acknowledged as a critical challenge in dialogue annotation, making it hard to define a single, clear purpose for each utterance in complex conversational settings [2].

Moreover, the DDA (Dependency Dialogue Act) annotation scheme, which builds on the principles of DAMSL, further refines this approach by integrating both multi-functionality and a structured response mechanism. DDA not only allows for multiple labels to be assigned to an utterance but also emphasizes the relationships between these dialogue acts and underlying discourse structures, anchoring them within the context of the dialogue [1] [2]. This enhanced resolution of response structures helps unravel deeper discourse patterns while simultaneously incorporating the speaker's intentions into the analysis—thus facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of conversational dynamics.

In contrast to traditional methods that might strictly categorize utterances into single labels, annotation schemes like DAMSL and DDA accommodate the nuanced nature of dialogue by allowing multiple dimensions of meaning to be represented. Such a multidimensional approach ensures that the various communicative intents can be captured and related effectively, ultimately enriching the dialogue act tagging process and providing a more reliable framework for understanding conversational data [2] [4].

In summary, annotation schemes like DAMSL tackle multi-tag issues in dialogue act tagging by supporting multi-labeling inherently in their design, acknowledging the pragmatic overloading of utterances, and providing a structured way to analyze complex conversational contexts. This flexibility is critical for developing more accurate and representative dialogue systems, as highlighted in the literature [3] [4].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: ; li-etal-2021-self .Our proposed Dependency Dialogue Act (DDA) annotation scheme builds upon previous work on discourse annotation by merging different features from existing schemes into a single system that captures a large amount of conversational context while minimizing annotator effort. One of the primary goals is the ability to preserve both rhetorical and response relations between different turns in the utterance.Additionally, we want to embrace the inherent overloading nature of conversations by enabling annotators to select multiple labels per utterance where appropriate. Finally, the DDA scheme anchors the speaker’s intention with context.The goal of this paper is to define the Dependency Dialogue Act (DDA) annotation scheme for discourse analysis and investigate its effectiveness in the context of multi-threaded multi-party conversations. In Section 3, we define the response structure of DDA and present the tagset composed of two class types: Dialog Acts and

Nevertheless, we made two augmentations: first, DDA handles multi-functionality phenomenon with multi-label and multi-dependency; second, DDA resolves the response structure, which not only unveils a deeper discourse structure in conversations but also anchors the dialogue act and discourse relations into context, which is

(1991); Core and Allen (1997); Stolcke et al. (2000a). The corresponding classification task, dialog act tagging, is a crucial component in creating dialog systems, as it allows for a simple way of modeling the user’s communicative intent through text classification. In this paper, we do not make contributions to dialog act tagging, but we use existing work.3.   ApproachIn this section we outline the data, modeling techniques, and evaluation measures used throughout the paper.3.1.   Face Act DataAs discussed in Section 2, we use the face data set developed by Dutt et al. (2020) for our experiments. Wang et al.

Furthermore, the scheme contains a generic dimension and communicative functions, which is suitable for mapping virtually any kind of conversation, both task-based and non task-based. Moreover, its multidimensional aspect and hierarchical taxonomy make it extensible and potentially adaptable to specific conversational sets.2.2 Dialogue Act TaggingThe automatic recognition of Dialogue Acts has been addressed by the literature using various machine learning techniques. In particular DA classification has been modeled both as a sequence labeling problem, using techniques such as HMM [Stolcke et al., 2000], neural networks [Ji et al., 2016, Kumar et al., 2017] or CRF [Quarteroni et al., 2011], and as a multi-class classification problem, using for example SVM [Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010]. Mentioning and comparing all DA classification approaches is
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997), now the most commonly adapted methodology for dialog act annotations, made supporting multiple labels a primary objective in its design. Future annotations of face acts should do the same and the frequency that multiple act utterances were found in our error analysis supports this recommendation.Face acts are an important part of language use, and while Dutt et al. (2020) have made a major contribution, there has been little work with this corpus, and future work will require thinking hard about the data. We hope this paper will allow other researchers to use the corpus in constructive ways while being aware of the nature of the data in more detail. Despite their similarities from a computational perspective, it does not seem to be as simple as lifting the approaches used for dialog acts when modeling face acts.In the future, we plan to develop an annotation which incorporates additional aspects of politeness theory and to label a corpus with in-house
