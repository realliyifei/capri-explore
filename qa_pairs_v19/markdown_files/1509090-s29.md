## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

Multiword expressions (MWEs) present significant challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to their non-compositional nature and the variability in their surface forms, particularly for verbal MWEs. MWE-aware parsing addresses these challenges through a combination of techniques designed to accurately identify and interpret MWEs within text.

Firstly, the non-compositionality of MWEs means that their meanings cannot be derived from the meanings of their individual components. For instance, expressions like "kick the bucket" convey a meaning (to die) that is not apparent from the individual words. This has required the development of models that can recognize and understand MWEs contextually. MWE-aware systems often utilize a lexicon of MWEs, which serves as a critical resource in identifying such expressions, allowing models to match phrases to their specific meanings rather than relying solely on individual word meanings [2] [5]. By leveraging gloss information‚Äîdefinitions that elucidate the meaning of an MWE in context‚Äîthese models can better filter MWE candidates and ensure that identified MWEs appropriately fit the surrounding context [4].

Secondly, discontiguity, particularly in verbal MWEs where components may be conjugated or separated, poses an additional challenge. For example, a verb and its particle may appear far apart but still constitute a complete MWE. MWE-aware parsers utilize rules and patterns from their lexicons to recognize these MWEs even when they are not contiguous. This capability is crucial, as disjointed MWEs can significantly alter the intended meaning within text [5]. Recent advancements have also seen the introduction of machine learning approaches, such as CRF-based and token tagging systems, which can adaptively learn from data to better identify MWEs, even in the presence of variations in their structure [5] [1].

Furthermore, integrating both rule-based systems and machine learning models allows for a hybrid approach that compensates for the weaknesses of each method. Rule-based systems, while strong in precision, may struggle with variability, whereas machine learning models can generalize better but may lack precision without sufficient training data. MWE-aware parsing systems represent a confluence of these methods, thereby improving identification rates while maintaining high accuracy [5] [2]. 

In conclusion, MWE-aware parsing effectively tackles the challenges posed by non-compositionality and discontiguity through leveraging MWE lexicons for contextually relevant identification, implementing rule-based and machine learning approaches to capture MWE variations, and harnessing gloss information to ensure that identified expressions are accurately interpreted within their textual environment. This multifaceted methodology is vital in advancing the accuracy of natural language understanding in NLP applications.

(2015), but they can be broadly defined as groupings of words whose meaning is not entirely composed of the meanings of included words (Sag et¬†al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2010). This includes idioms such as a taste of one‚Äôs own medicine, verb-particle constructions such as break up or run down, compound nouns such as bus stop, and any other grouping of words with non-compositional semantics. In fact, a significant portion of noun MWEs are named entities (Savary et¬†al., 2019).The task of MWE identification is locating these MWEs in a given body of text. Common approaches to solving MWE identification include rule-based systems (Foufi et¬†al., 2017; Pasquer et¬†al.,

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: understand the meaning of words or MWEs in context.In this paper, we propose a system that tackles these tasks together, using a MWE lexicon and rule-based pipeline to identify MWE candidates and a trainable model to both perform WSD and filter MWE candidates. Our model is a modified Poly-encoder (Humeau et¬†al., 2020), a natural extension of previous work using Bi-encoders for WSD Blevins and Zettlemoyer (2020); Kohli (2021). Utilizing gloss information111For example, in ‚ÄúThe couple broke up amicably‚Äù, the gloss, or definition, of the sense of break up is ‚Äúdiscontinue an association or relation; go different ways.‚Äù Miller (1995) allows our model to consider the meaning of MWEs and filter out candidates where the constituents of a MWE are present but the MWE meaning does not fit the context, such as the aforementioned literal usage of kick the bucket. Our method improves precision and achieves state-of-the-art F1 for MWE identification on the DiMSUM dataset (Schneider et¬†al., 2016)
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: 2019).The task of MWE identification is locating these MWEs in a given body of text. Common approaches to solving MWE identification include rule-based systems (Foufi et¬†al., 2017; Pasquer et¬†al., 2020), CRF-based systems Liu et¬†al. (2021), and token tagging systems (Rohanian et¬†al., 2019). Rule-based systems remain competitive with neural models in this task, and many systems including ours use MWE lexicons in order to identify MWEs, which Savary et¬†al. (2019) argue are critical to making progress in MWE identification. Kurfalƒ± and √ñstling (2020) and Kanclerz and Piasecki (2022) are similar to our work in that they frame the task of MWE identification as a classification problem, although neither use gloss information.Among all the types of MWEs, verbal MWEs are particularly difficult to identify due to their surface variability ‚Äî constituents can be conjugated or separated so that they become discontinuous (Pasquer et¬†al., 2020).
