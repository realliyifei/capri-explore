## Answer

I don't know because the context provided does not contain specific information about how statement scoring strategies are categorized or the key characteristics of each approach. The passages focus on general concepts related to natural language processing (NLP), question answering (QA) systems, and the need for evaluation metrics, but they do not delve into detailed scoring strategies or classifications related to performance measurement of these systems. Thus, the information necessary to comprehensively answer the question is absent.

The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence.

Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the

Besides these tasks, text classification, which assigns a document to a specific category, is one of the main areas in which NLP is employed. Categorizing customer requests, sorting emails or papers, understanding user ideas in social media, exploring trends, and topic labelling for documents are some of the application areas of text classification [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In all these tasks, NLP builds a bridge between linguistic structure and computer-based analysis to cover the underlying conceptual content of large amounts of text data.NLP, or text processing, is a rapidly evolving area of computer science. The traditional text analysis methods depend on rule-based statistical modeling [10], such as Naïve Bayes, K-nearest, Decision Trees. They use hand-crafted feature engineering techniques to solve problems. Furthermore, classical algorithms are largely domain-dependent; it is important to have domain knowledge of the document

Furthermore, many error scores have been introduced, e.g., based on n-gram matching, word embeddings, or contextual embeddings to measure the performance of a QA system. This survey attempts to provide a systematic overview of the general framework of QA, QA paradigms, benchmark datasets, and assessment techniques for a quantitative evaluation of QA systems. The latter is particularly important because not only is the construction of a QA system complex but also its evaluation. We hypothesize that a reason, therefore, is that the quantitative formalization of human judgment is an open problem.keywords: Natural Language Processing, Question Answering, Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence
