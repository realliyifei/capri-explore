## Answer

## I don't know?: False

The assessment of the quality of multiword expression (MWE) translation in machine translation (MT) systems is fraught with several challenges and limitations. These can be categorized broadly into obstacles related to the recognition and translation of MWEs, as well as issues inherent in current evaluation methods.

Firstly, MWEs present a significant challenge for MT systems themselves. The complex nature of MWEs, which often comprise phrases or combinations of words that carry meanings distinct from their individual components, limits the ability of MT systems to accurately recognize and translate them. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for effective natural language processing (NLP); their absence or incorrect translation can lead to poor performance in various applications, including MT, text summarization, and web search [3]. This intricacy highlights a foundational problem: the difficulty of teaching machines to learn and generate human languages in a natural form, compounded by the significant reliance on MWEs in natural language [4] [5].

Moreover, traditional MT evaluation metrics have proven inadequate in capturing the nuances of MWE translation quality. Many popular automatic evaluation metrics fail to correctly assess how well different MT systems handle MWEs, leading to an inaccurate appraisal of translation quality. This inadequacy in evaluation methods is compounded by the requirement that a robust evaluation must account for both fluency—how natural the translated output appears—and adequacy—how accurately it reflects the intended meaning [1] [2]. As a result, the challenge lies not only in the machine's ability to translate MWEs accurately but also in developing metrics capable of recognizing such translations.

Additionally, the significance of MWEs in the domain-specific terminology is crucial, and overlooking this aspect can lead to dire consequences for MT systems’ performance. For instance, translating technical terms that constitute MWEs inaccurately can distort the intended message and diminish the utility of the translation [3]. This situation further complicates the evaluation of MT systems, emphasizing the need for nuanced evaluation frameworks that can distinguish between variations in MWE handling.

Finally, while human-in-the-loop evaluation approaches can improve the assessment by incorporating human judgment in identifying and evaluating MWEs, this method can be resource-intensive and may not scale well across numerous languages and contexts. This dependence on human intervention raises concerns regarding the consistency, scalability, and generalizability of the evaluations [1].

In summary, the primary challenges in assessing MWE translation quality in MT systems stem from the inherent complexity of MWEs, the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics, and the criticality of domain-specific terminology. Addressing these challenges is vital for advancing the reliability and performance of MT systems in the context of fluency and meaning equivalence in translations.

[3]:  Passage ID 3: be done before one can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWEs successfully [12].The study of multiword expressions in NLP has been gaining prominence, and in recent years the number of researchers and projects focusing on them has increased dramatically. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for NLP, including MT and Translation Technology. The inability to detect MWEs automatically may result in incorrect (and even unfortunate) automatic translations and may jeopardise the performance of applications such as text summarisation and web search.Multiword expressions do not only play a crucial role in the computational treatment of natural languages. Often terms are multiword expressions (and not single words), making them highly relevant to terminology. The requirement for correct rendering of MWEs in translation and interpretation highlights their importance in these fields. Given the pervasive nature of MWEs, they play a crucial
