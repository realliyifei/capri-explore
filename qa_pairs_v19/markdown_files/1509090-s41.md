## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Assessing the quality of multiword expression (MWE) translation in machine translation (MT) systems presents a range of challenges and limitations. Key issues include the inherent complexity of MWEs, the shortcomings of current evaluation metrics, and the necessity for a nuanced understanding of context and domain-specific terminology.

1. **Complexity of MWEs**: MWEs are combinations of words that function as a single unit in natural language, such as idioms, collocations, and fixed phrases. Their complexity poses a significant challenge in MT because a straightforward word-for-word translation often fails to convey the intended meaning. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential, as their incorrect detection or translation can lead to inaccuracies that undermine the overall quality of MT outputs [1][3]. This complexity creates a bottleneck, leading to difficulties in assessing how effectively different MT systems can recognize and translate MWEs accurately and meaningfully [1][2].

2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The limitations of popular automatic evaluation metrics are a critical challenge. These metrics often fall short in accurately reflecting the true quality of MWEs in translations. For example, they may inadequately assess fluency and adequacy, particularly when dealing with MWEs that may have different meanings or uses in different contexts [1]. Human evaluation methods that incorporate a “Human-in-the-Loop” approach are suggested as potential solutions to bridge this gap [2]. However, even these methods face challenges in consistency and subjectivity.

3. **Context Awareness**: MWEs frequently derive their meanings from context, making it difficult for MT systems to achieve accurate translations without a deep understanding of linguistic and cultural nuances. An MWE may have a particular meaning in one context that differs significantly in another, and this contextual sensitivity is critical for accurate translation [3]. The inability of MT systems to adequately process contextual information compounds the risk of generating translations that are linguistically correct but semantically inappropriate.

4. **Domain-Specific Terminology**: In many cases, MWEs contain domain-specific terminology that requires a specialized understanding for accurate translation. The failure to recognize and properly translate these terms can significantly impact the applicability of MT systems across different domains, leading to poor quality outputs in technical or specialized contexts [3]. Assessing how well MT systems handle these specific challenges is crucial for evaluating their overall performance.

5. **Human vs. Machine Evaluation**: The current gap between human and machine evaluations creates a limitation in assessing translation quality. While humans can recognize subtle differences in meaning and contextual usage, current machine evaluations are often less discerning, which can overlook critical factors of translation quality related to MWEs [2][3].

In summary, the assessment of MWE translation quality in MT systems is limited by the complexity of MWEs, the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics, a lack of contextual awareness, challenges surrounding domain-specific terminology, and the disparities between human and machine evaluations. These interrelated challenges necessitate more advanced approaches in both the development of MT systems and the methodologies used for their evaluation.

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: be done before one can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWEs successfully [12].The study of multiword expressions in NLP has been gaining prominence, and in recent years the number of researchers and projects focusing on them has increased dramatically. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for NLP, including MT and Translation Technology. The inability to detect MWEs automatically may result in incorrect (and even unfortunate) automatic translations and may jeopardise the performance of applications such as text summarisation and web search.Multiword expressions do not only play a crucial role in the computational treatment of natural languages. Often terms are multiword expressions (and not single words), making them highly relevant to terminology. The requirement for correct rendering of MWEs in translation and interpretation highlights their importance in these fields. Given the pervasive nature of MWEs, they play a crucial

MT belongs to a branch of computational linguistics (CL) and artificial intelligence (AI), in which researchers try to use computational modeling to address linguistic text translation problems. It is a very challenging task for MT to achieve both accuracy of translated information and fluency at the level of a human expert’s performance or what linguists expect as output. There are many reasons for this, one of which is that the use of MWEs presents a significant obstacle for a machine to learn and generate human languages in a natural form. We use three examples to illustrate the importance of correct use of MWEs in MT.We use ZH/Zh to represent Chinese, and EN/En as English. We use pinyin (pīnyīn) to annotate the Báihuà Chinese for its pronunciation and tones (phoneticism). The MT outputs in the examples were from Google Translator engine [Vaswani
