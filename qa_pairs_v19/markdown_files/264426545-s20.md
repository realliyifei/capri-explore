## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The provided context does not contain any information regarding a SELL-CORPUS designed for L2 English learners in China or any specific features and components related to such a corpus. The passages mainly discuss general NLP concepts, the utilization of large language models, the development of datasets, and methodologies in question formulation, but there is no mention of a corpus specifically tailored for L2 learners in China.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: akin to Inpars [1], which utilizes the GPT-3 API to generate potential questions for assorted documents. However, given the stringent privacy and security protocols that typically regulate enterprise knowledge bases, we utilize instruction-tuning to train the deployable, private LLMs. In this scenario, dealing with non-English corpus, we specifically integrate an open-source LLM, i.e., Baichuan-13B as the backbone.For training, we utilize a minimal amount of document-query pairs annotated by experts. And to address the two types of questions previously introduced, i.e., fact-oriented and solution-oriented, we develop two distinct instructions as follows.Instruction for generating fact-oriented questionsPlease carefully review the provided document and formulate specific questions that directly relate to its content. It is important that the answers to these questions can be located within the document itself. Instruction for generating solution-oriented
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: have received. To train a model to perform a certain task well, the last step a practitioner must go through is to use available downloadable task-specific corpora, or build one’s own task-specific corpus. This last training step is usually supervised. It is also recommended that if several tasks are to be performed, multi-task training be used wherever possible.V ConclusionsEarly applications of natural language processing included a well-acclaimed but simpleminded algebra word problem solver program called STUDENT [272], as well as interesting but severely constrained conversational systems such as Eliza, which acted as a “psycho-therapist” [273]), and another that conversed about manipulating blocks in a microworld [274]. Nowadays, highly advanced applications of NLP are ubiquitous. These include Google’s and Microsoft’s machine translators, which translate more or less competently from a language to scores of other languages, as well as a number of devices which process
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: years showed significant advancements [98, 7, 19] in natural language processing (NLP): Large language models (LLMs) emerged [8], facilitating new methodologies by describing tasks in natural language without a strong formalism. Because resource-intensive LLMs are not always superior [112], smaller, supervised learning-based models are still highly relevant for specialized domains or use cases that require rapid inference or are constrained by hardware limitations (such as mobile devices or offline scenarios) [34].One of these domains is entity recognition [73]. Entity recognition  (ER) describes the task of assigning a label to a sequence of words (e.g. to extract a person, a date or any other predefined label). To apply supervised learning to ER, data must be annotated. The manual annotation process, in which humans annotate data points with these predefined labels, is time-intensive and expensive [106]. Its output is an annotated dataset, which is also called corpus (pl. corpora)
