## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

The SELL-CORPUS is designed specifically for second language (L2) English learners in China and includes several notable features and components that facilitate research and learning. 

Firstly, the corpus consists of audio recordings from 389 volunteer speakers, which includes a gender distribution of 186 males and 203 females, illustrating a balanced representation [1]. The speakers hail from seven major regional dialects of China, namely Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, Min, Hakka, and Southwestern Mandarin, which allows for a diverse range of accents within the corpus [1].

In terms of the duration and volume of speech data, the SELL-CORPUS contains a substantial amount‚Äî31.6 hours of recorded speech, which provides ample material for analysis and training purposes [1]. Each recording features word-level orthographic transcriptions, which are essential for understanding the pronunciation and the phonetic characteristics of the spoken language [1].

Additionally, the corpus incorporates various ratings and assessments. Each utterance is accompanied by human ratings that evaluate pronunciation accuracy on a scale of 0 to 10. This scoring system allows researchers to quantify speaker performance and includes binary assessments on seven specific factors that affect pronunciation quality: intelligibility, phoneme quality, phoneme mispronunciation, syllable stress quality, intonation quality, correctness of pauses, and mother tongue influence [1]. These factors provide a multifaceted view of pronunciation challenges faced by learners, enhancing the corpus's utility for both pedagogical and research-oriented applications.

Moreover, the highlight of the SELL-CORPUS is its focus on a variety of phonetic and prosodic aspects that are crucial for L2 learners, making it a valuable resource for understanding the intricate dynamics of English language acquisition among Chinese speakers [1].

In summary, the SELL-CORPUS includes a diverse range of speakers, significant audio time, phonetic transcriptions, human ratings of pronunciation across multiple dimensions, alongside assessments that provide insight into the pronunciation quality impacted by various factors, collectively making it an important resource for studying L2 English learning in China.
