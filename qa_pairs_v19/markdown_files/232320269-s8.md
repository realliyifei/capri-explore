## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information regarding the NELA toolkit or how linguistic features are categorized and applied within it for analyzing news media. The passages discuss various aspects of NLP, including text classification and its applications, but they do not mention the NELA toolkit or its methodologies. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your question based on the given context.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: questions [2], summarization [3], digital assistants [4]. Besides these tasks, text classification, which assigns a document to a specific category, is one of the main areas in which NLP is employed. Categorizing customer requests, sorting emails or papers, understanding user ideas in social media, exploring trends, and topic labelling for documents are some of the application areas of text classification [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In all these tasks, NLP builds a bridge between linguistic structure and computer-based analysis to cover the underlying conceptual content of large amounts of text data.NLP, or text processing, is a rapidly evolving area of computer science. The traditional text analysis methods depend on rule-based statistical modeling [10], such as Naïve Bayes, K-nearest, Decision Trees. They use hand-crafted feature engineering techniques to solve problems. Furthermore, classical algorithms are largely domain-dependent; it is important to have domain knowledge of the document
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: we introduce in Section 1.2 NLP methods that are applicable to political science, including text classification, topic modeling, event extraction, and score prediction. Next, we cover a variety of cases where NLP can be applied to policymaking in Section 1.3. Specifically, we cover four stages: analyzing data for evidence-based policymaking, improving policy communication with the public, investigating policy effects, and interpreting political phenomena to the public. Finally, we will discuss limitations and ethical considerations when using NLP for policymaking in Section 1.4.1.2 NLP for Text AnalysisNLP brings powerful computational tools to analyze textual data (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000).According to the type of information that we want to extract from the text, we introduce four different NLP tools to analyze text data: text classification (by which the extracted information is the category of the text), topic modeling (by which the extracted information is the key topics
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: coding of documents into a predetermined set of categories, then train an NLP model to learn the text classification task (Sun et al., 2019), and verify the performance of the NLP model on a held-out subset of the data, as introduced in Grimmer and Stewart (2013). An example of adapting the state-of-the-art NLP models on a customized dataset is demonstrated in this guide.222https://skimai.com/fine-tuning-bert-for-sentiment-analysis/Using the text classification method, we can automate many types of analyses in political science. As listed in the examples in Figure 1.2, researchers can detect political perspective of news articles (Huguet Cabot et al., 2020), the stance in media on a certain topic (Luo et al., 2020), whether campaigns use positive or negative sentiment (Ansolabehere and Iyengar, 1995), which issue area is the legislation about (Adler and Wilkerson, 2011),topics in parliament speech (Albaugh et al., 2013; Osnabrügge et al., 2021), congressional bills (Hillard et al.,
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with text understanding and text generation. The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their
