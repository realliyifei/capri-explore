## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context lacks specific details about the NELA toolkit and how it categorizes and applies linguistic features for analyzing news media. None of the passages reference the toolkit itself or provide examples of its methodology for applying NLP in the context of news media analysis. Without that information, I cannot provide a precise answer.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: questions [2], summarization [3], digital assistants [4]. Besides these tasks, text classification, which assigns a document to a specific category, is one of the main areas in which NLP is employed. Categorizing customer requests, sorting emails or papers, understanding user ideas in social media, exploring trends, and topic labelling for documents are some of the application areas of text classification [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In all these tasks, NLP builds a bridge between linguistic structure and computer-based analysis to cover the underlying conceptual content of large amounts of text data.NLP, or text processing, is a rapidly evolving area of computer science. The traditional text analysis methods depend on rule-based statistical modeling [10], such as Naïve Bayes, K-nearest, Decision Trees. They use hand-crafted feature engineering techniques to solve problems. Furthermore, classical algorithms are largely domain-dependent; it is important to have domain knowledge of the document
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: we introduce in Section 1.2 NLP methods that are applicable to political science, including text classification, topic modeling, event extraction, and score prediction. Next, we cover a variety of cases where NLP can be applied to policymaking in Section 1.3. Specifically, we cover four stages: analyzing data for evidence-based policymaking, improving policy communication with the public, investigating policy effects, and interpreting political phenomena to the public. Finally, we will discuss limitations and ethical considerations when using NLP for policymaking in Section 1.4.1.2 NLP for Text AnalysisNLP brings powerful computational tools to analyze textual data (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000).According to the type of information that we want to extract from the text, we introduce four different NLP tools to analyze text data: text classification (by which the extracted information is the category of the text), topic modeling (by which the extracted information is the key topics
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: coding of documents into a predetermined set of categories, then train an NLP model to learn the text classification task (Sun et al., 2019), and verify the performance of the NLP model on a held-out subset of the data, as introduced in Grimmer and Stewart (2013). An example of adapting the state-of-the-art NLP models on a customized dataset is demonstrated in this guide.222https://skimai.com/fine-tuning-bert-for-sentiment-analysis/Using the text classification method, we can automate many types of analyses in political science. As listed in the examples in Figure 1.2, researchers can detect political perspective of news articles (Huguet Cabot et al., 2020), the stance in media on a certain topic (Luo et al., 2020), whether campaigns use positive or negative sentiment (Ansolabehere and Iyengar, 1995), which issue area is the legislation about (Adler and Wilkerson, 2011),topics in parliament speech (Albaugh et al., 2013; Osnabrügge et al., 2021), congressional bills (Hillard et al.,
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: On the other hand, NLG enables computers to produce natural language from structured data or other unstructured text inputs. The primary objective of NLG is to communicate information in a way that is comprehensible to human beings and appropriate as per the given situation. Instances include question answering [22], machine translation [3] and text summarization [23, 24].3.1 Applications of NLPSome of the renowned applications of NLP have been elucidated as follows:3.1.1 Sentiment AnalysisSentiment analysis is an application of NLP concerned with the extraction and evaluation of expressions, feelings, and orientations of people regarding a certain physical or abstract subject [1]. It has evolved over a period of time with primarily three tiers of analysis- document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. While Document-Based methods provide the overall sentiment for the entire document, they fail to capture the sentiments expressed in individual sentiments [25, 58].
