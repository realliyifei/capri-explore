## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not provide specific information regarding the utilization of advanced machine learning models for coreference resolution tasks prior to the advent of deep learning. The focus of the passages mainly discusses the impact of deep learning and neural networks in natural language processing (NLP) and related fields, without detailing prior models, techniques, or approaches specifically related to coreference resolution. Therefore, there is insufficient information available to adequately answer the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: in NLP have leveraged the power of modern ANNs with many propitious results, beginning in large part with the pioneering work of Collobert et al. [9]. In the very recent past, the use of deep learning has upsurged considerably [10, 11]. This has led to significant advances both in core areas of NLP and in areas in which it is directly applied to achieve practical and useful objectives. This survey provides a brief introduction to both natural language processing and deep neural networks, and then presents an extensive discussion on how deep learning is being used to solve current problems in NLP. While several other papers and books on the topic have been published [12, 10], none have extensively covered the state-of-the-art in as many areas within it. Furthermore, no other survey has examined not only the applications of deep learning to computational linguistics, but also the underlying theory and traditional NLP tasks. In addition to the discussion of recent revolutionary

In recent years, deep neural network-based approaches to realizing different forms of data-driven representation learning have gained widespread interest due to their competitiveness and flexibility. Question Answering (QA) is widely considered one of the most important tasks of NLP, as it enables humans to interact with machines in a more natural way by either extracting information related to questions from different knowledge sources or by generating the answer without the need for using structural query languages. In other words, QA tries to retrieve or generate answers in the form of a natural language based on a given input, instead of, providing a ranked list of documents as provided by search engines or classic information retrieval systems which require additional steps for checking each document to find useful content 12.Since the 1960s many question-answering systems have been

However, looking further forward, it can be anticipated that deep learning models will become the norm in computational linguistics, with pre-training and transfer learning playing highly impactful roles. Collobert et al. [9] sparked the deep learning revolution in NLP, although one of the key contributions of their work—that of a single unified model—was not realized widely. Instead, neural networks were introduced into traditional NLP tasks, and are only now reconnecting. In the field of parsing, for example, most models continue to implement non-neural structures, simply using ANNs on the side to make the decisions that were previously done using rules and probability models. While more versatile and general architectures are obviously becoming more and more of a reality, understanding the abstract concepts handled by such networks is important to understanding how to build and train better networks. Furthermore, as abstraction is a hallmark of human intelligence,
