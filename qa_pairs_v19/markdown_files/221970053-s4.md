## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not discuss the specific techniques or models used for coreference resolution tasks before the rise of deep learning. While it mentions the progression from simple rule-based systems to advanced machine learning techniques [2], it does not elaborate on the types of advanced machine learning models that were used nor their application in coreference resolution specifically. Additionally, details regarding the methodologies, performance characteristics, or specific implementations prior to deep learning are absent, limiting the ability to provide an informed answer on this topic.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: in NLP have leveraged the power of modern ANNs with many propitious results, beginning in large part with the pioneering work of Collobert et al. [9]. In the very recent past, the use of deep learning has upsurged considerably [10, 11]. This has led to significant advances both in core areas of NLP and in areas in which it is directly applied to achieve practical and useful objectives. This survey provides a brief introduction to both natural language processing and deep neural networks, and then presents an extensive discussion on how deep learning is being used to solve current problems in NLP. While several other papers and books on the topic have been published [12, 10], none have extensively covered the state-of-the-art in as many areas within it. Furthermore, no other survey has examined not only the applications of deep learning to computational linguistics, but also the underlying theory and traditional NLP tasks. In addition to the discussion of recent revolutionary

In recent years, deep neural network-based approaches to realizing different forms of data-driven representation learning have gained widespread interest due to their competitiveness and flexibility. Question Answering (QA) is widely considered one of the most important tasks of NLP, as it enables humans to interact with machines in a more natural way by either extracting information related to questions from different knowledge sources or by generating the answer without the need for using structural query languages. In other words, QA tries to retrieve or generate answers in the form of a natural language based on a given input, instead of, providing a ranked list of documents as provided by search engines or classic information retrieval systems which require additional steps for checking each document to find useful content 12.Since the 1960s many question-answering systems have been

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: learning into NLP marked a significant shift, enabling models to learn from data rather than relying solely on predefined rules. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used for text classification tasks, leveraging the ability to find optimal decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces. Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classifier, was popular for tasks like spam detection, utilizing the Bayes theorem to make predictions based on word frequencies.The rise of deep learning brought transformative changes to NLP, with neural networks enabling more sophisticated language models. Techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe represented words as dense vectors in continuous space, capturing semantic relationships and improving the performance of downstream tasks. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and their variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excelled at processing sequential data, making them suitable for tasks such as language modeling and machine translation. The introduction of
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: years showed significant advancements [98, 7, 19] in natural language processing (NLP): Large language models (LLMs) emerged [8], facilitating new methodologies by describing tasks in natural language without a strong formalism. Because resource-intensive LLMs are not always superior [112], smaller, supervised learning-based models are still highly relevant for specialized domains or use cases that require rapid inference or are constrained by hardware limitations (such as mobile devices or offline scenarios) [34].One of these domains is entity recognition [73]. Entity recognition Â (ER) describes the task of assigning a label to a sequence of words (e.g. to extract a person, a date or any other predefined label). To apply supervised learning to ER, data must be annotated. The manual annotation process, in which humans annotate data points with these predefined labels, is time-intensive and expensive [106]. Its output is an annotated dataset, which is also called corpus (pl. corpora)
