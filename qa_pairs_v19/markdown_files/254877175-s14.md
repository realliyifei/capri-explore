We show how using commas can enforce right-to-left (R2L) tokenization for the same addition problem. R2L tokenization leads to improved model performance on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (March 2023 models), which we show is due to tokenization alignment between addends and answer through various controls and error analyses.

## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information regarding recent studies on the effectiveness of subword tokenization techniques, especially in relation to handling numeracy within language models. The passages discuss various aspects of natural language processing (NLP), word representation models, and the general functionality of language models, but they do not specifically address subword tokenization or its assessments in relation to numeracy tasks. Therefore, the context is insufficient to provide a precise answer to your question.

NLP has been used broadly to summarize text documents, deduce author sentiment, solve symbolic math problems, and even generate programming code 22, 23, 24, 25. The effectiveness of NLP is predicated on the view that (human) languages consist of a structured symbolic syntax with a defined set of assembly rules of basic units of a language known as ”tokens” (e.g., characters, words, or punctuation) that can be pieced together to form higher/̄order constructs such as sentences or paragraphs. The structured output of such a system reflect the grammar, conventions, and styles of the associated languages. Tokens, which are represented computationally in NLP models as mathematical vectors, are manipulated and processed to encode ’meanings’, such that tokens of similar ”meaning” are mathematically closer together in vector space. By analyzing a large collection of data, NLP methods are used to infer emergent

In this survey, we explore different word representation models and its power of expression, from the classical to modern-day state-of-the-art word representation language models (LMS). We describe a variety of text representation methods, and model designs have blossomed in the context of NLP, including SOTA LMs. These models can transform large volumes of text into effective vector representations capturing the same semantic information. Further, such representations can be utilized by various machine learning (ML) algorithms for a variety of NLP related tasks. In the end, this survey briefly discusses the commonly used ML and DL based classifiers, evaluation metrics and the applications of these word embeddings in different NLP tasks.Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Word representation, Language
