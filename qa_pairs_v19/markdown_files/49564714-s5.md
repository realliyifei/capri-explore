## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Cross-lingual training approaches address the issue of cross-lingual variation in multilingual natural language processing (NLP) by leveraging various strategies that enhance performance across different languages, particularly when dealing with high-resource and low-resource language pairs.

One significant approach involves the use of multilingual models that capitalize on the linguistic knowledge encoded from a wide range of languages. These models can facilitate cross-lingual transfer, which is especially beneficial for transferring knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource ones. Research has indicated that when multilingual models, like multilingual BERT, are fine-tuned on extensive datasets, they can effectively learn cross-lingual information that bolsters performance on tasks such as lemmatization and morphological tagging [4]. This suggests that training on diverse linguistic data allows models to better understand and adapt to cross-lingual variations.

Moreover, the continuous cross-lingual representation space is another innovative approach that encodes linguistic features from multiple languages into a cohesive space. This enables models to better handle the nuances and variations present across languages, contributing to improved performance in tasks where traditional multilingual models may falter due to insufficient data [4].

The research highlights an important consideration: many previous works have primarily focused on single-transfer scenarios, predominantly involving English as the source language. However, there is a growing recognition of the need to incorporate multiple source languages into training datasets. This shift is anticipated to enhance model generalization for downstream tasks and improve outcomes in instances of zero-shot transfer, where the model is tested on languages it has not explicitly been trained on [1]. 

Furthermore, in scenarios where there is a lack of specialized datasets and terminology, adaptive machine translation (MT) techniques, particularly those utilizing large-scale language models (LLMs), have shown promise. These models can improve translation consistency and contextual relevance by generating bilingual synthetic data tailored to specific domains [2][3]. By fostering continuous feedback mechanisms, LLMs can adaptively enhance MT systems, addressing the challenges posed by cross-lingual variation in specialized contexts where in-domain data is scarce [3].

Lastly, an acknowledgment of the lexicographic aspects of cross-lingual models highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of language context beyond mere translation [5]. This includes dynamics such as word-to-word equivalence retrieval and the importance of context in translation, which is pivotal for achieving high-quality outcomes in multilingual settings.

In conclusion, cross-lingual training approaches effectively tackle cross-lingual variation by employing multilingual models, continuous representation spaces, adaptive MT techniques, and an emphasis on contextual understanding, ultimately leading to improved performance across diverse languages in NLP tasks.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: previous work is only limited to the setting of single-transfer between two languages, in which only one source language (predominately English) is utilized.Current advances in translation model and data gathering process have enabled the creation of datasets in many languages, thus multiple source languages should be considered.Intuitively, additional training data from more languages can help improve model’s generalization on downstream tasks, and learning from text in multiple languages may have a positive effect on zero-shot transfer.We believe that multi-transfer setting is the next important step for cross-lingual transfer, both to improve model performance across languages and to provide a more complete picture of multi-linguality in machine learning.In this paper, we focus on what has been missing in previous works by aiming to answer the following three major research questions:Q1: How do the relations in the linguistic landscape affect an IE model’s cross-lingual
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: I examined how to leverage language modelling techniques in general and LLMs in particular to improve translation features that involve human interaction and continuous feedback, such as adaptive MT, terminology-constrained MT, domain-aware automatic post-editing, auto-suggestion and auto-completion. In the second research question, I addressed a common scenario in the translation industry, namely receiving highly specialised projects, where there is hardly any parallel in-domain data. In such scenarios where there is insufficient in-domain data to fine-tune MT models, producing translations that are consistent with the relevant context is challenging. One way to address this question is through domain-specific text generation with LLMs and then fine-tuning an MT model using the generated bilingual in-domain synthetic data. Furthermore, this question overlaps with the first question, since real-time adaptive MT with LLMs can serve as an alternative approach to address in-domain data
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: common in translation settings, due to the lack of specialised datasets and terminology, or inconsistency and inaccuracy of available in-domain translations (Axelrod et al.,, 2011; Haddow and Koehn,, 2012).Recent advances in language modelling techniques in general and large-scale language models (LLMs) in particular have shown significant potential in improving a wide range of NLP tasks. Inspired by this idea, this research aims to answer two major Research Questions (RQ):RQ1In scenarios involving human interaction and continuous feedback, can we employ language models to improve the quality of adaptive MT at inference time? In the subsequent sections, I will be referring to this question as “Adaptive and Interactive MT”.RQ2In the absence of sufficient in-domain data, can we use pre-trained LLMs to improve the process of NMT domain adaptation? In the following sections, I will be referring to this question as “Domain-specific Text Generation for MT”.Figure 1.1:
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: for the deep neural network models [5]. Multilingual models have shown promising results for cross lingual transfer from high resource languages to low-resource languages [139] [80] [105] [106]. In [71], authors suggest that if the multilingual BERT model is fine tuned on all available treebanks, then it can learn good cross lingual information which boost the accuracy of the lemmatization and morphological tagging tasks. Still, for few shot and zero shot learning, we require techniques that work with less amount of data and can address the limitations of multilingual models. One such method is to use multilingual models that are trained on large number of languages and are capable of using linguistic knowledge on the low resource language. Currently, one such approach is the use of continuous cross lingual representation space that encode the linguistic knowledge of multiple languages into a single space.

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: enables the identification of those methods that consider natural language engineering aspects and implement them, and it offers valuable material for research in the NLP field.Overall, a great number of studies have been done on this topic, utilising various approaches and solving problems from different points of view. Despite this, the cross-lingual models still need to be properly researched from the lexicographic point of view to gain better results in the NLP field. Many authors aim at plain translation equivalent retrieval in the word-to-word format, and their primary focus is often on method improvement, viewing the issue from an NLP side while neglecting the language context.Nevertheless, the cross-lingual embedding models aspire to be a valuable contribution to the NLP field due to their availability for all languages and language pairs and the possibility of using text-balanced corpora simulating real-language scenarios. Given these reasons, they could also serve as
