## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Cross-lingual training approaches in multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) tackle the issue of cross-lingual variation through various methodologies primarily aimed at improving model performance when transferring knowledge between languages. The two significant approaches highlighted in the context are multilingual pre-training and the translate-test method.

1. **Multilingual Pre-training**: This approach involves constructing a multilingual encoder that is fine-tuned using data primarily from high-resource languages (HRLs), predominantly English. This encoder integrates words from various languages into a comprehensive vocabulary, thereby facilitating the creation of aligned hidden representations that assist in transferring knowledge across languages. By doing this, the model learns to generalize linguistic features and can better handle variations inherent to different languages, which helps in dealing with cross-lingual tasks effectively [3]. The intention is to prepare the model with a foundational understanding of multiple languages, which can subsequently improve performance in low-resource languages (LRLs) despite their variation from HRLs [5].

2. **Translate-Test Approach**: Another technique is the translate-test method, where test sets in other languages are translated into an intermediate language, typically English. This strategy allows for the use of English for both training and testing phases, hence directly addressing cross-lingual tasks. Although this method offers better interpretability because it operates in a single language for testing, it does have limitations, such as potential loss of contextual and cultural nuances present in the original languages [3]. The reliance on English as an intermediary can also hinder performance when dealing with languages that have significant structural differences from English.

Moreover, research emphasizes the importance of linguistic features like vocabulary overlap, which can significantly impact how well zero-shot learning—where a model applies knowledge from HRLs to LRLs—performs when small variations are introduced in the input [2]. This sensitivity indicates that successful cross-lingual transfer is not merely a matter of having a well-trained model; it also requires a rich understanding of the linguistic similarities and differences that exist among the languages involved.

Ultimately, the goal of these approaches is to create robust and adaptable multilingual models capable of addressing tasks across various languages, particularly in settings where annotated corpora may be scarce [4]. In tackling cross-lingual variation, the emphasis is placed on leveraging high-quality data from HRLs to inform and enhance the capabilities of models dealing with LRLs—an essential direction in advancing NLP capabilities for diverse linguistic landscapes [1][5]. 

These methods show a clear progression towards more effective cross-lingual training, highlighting the necessity of continuous exploration into adapting techniques that account for underlying linguistic variations as well as domains to ensure models can perform well across the board.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: previous work is only limited to the setting of single-transfer between two languages, in which only one source language (predominately English) is utilized.Current advances in translation model and data gathering process have enabled the creation of datasets in many languages, thus multiple source languages should be considered.Intuitively, additional training data from more languages can help improve model’s generalization on downstream tasks, and learning from text in multiple languages may have a positive effect on zero-shot transfer.We believe that multi-transfer setting is the next important step for cross-lingual transfer, both to improve model performance across languages and to provide a more complete picture of multi-linguality in machine learning.In this paper, we focus on what has been missing in previous works by aiming to answer the following three major research questions:Q1: How do the relations in the linguistic landscape affect an IE model’s cross-lingual
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: this is the case on specific tasks remains challenging due to linguistic variations and domain-specific differences.Recent research highlights sensitivity of NLP tasks to minor input changes, in contrast to evaluating against fixed gold standard Gardner et al. (2020).In this paper, we evaluate specifically the extent to which MLLM performance on a high-resource language (HRL) can be expected to transfer to a LRL that shares vocabulary similarity due to areal or genetic proximity, or linguistic borrowing, and the extent to which this assistance in performance is robust to input changes that are driven either by particulars of the task, or by semantic similarity.Hence, we explore the following questions in this paper:•How does the accuracy of zero-shot learning change when introducing minor variations to the original test input?•What impact do language features, such as vocabulary overlapping, have on zero-shot learning?Our novel contributions are as
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: transfer aims to tackle NLP tasks in multiple languages using training data from only one or a few languages, such as English. There are two primary approaches to addressing cross-lingual transfer: first, multilingual pre-training involves constructing a multilingual encoder, fine-tuning it in English, and directly testing it in other languages. The multilingual encoder combines words from all target languages to create a large vocabulary, and the hidden representations in the intermediate layers are implicitly aligned to facilitate the cross-lingual transfer. Second, the translate-test approach translates the test set of other languages into an intermediate language, typically English. This allows the model to use English as input for both training and testing, explicitly solving cross-lingual tasks.Compared to multilingual pre-training, translate-test offers better interpretability by utilizing an intermediate language. However, it has two drawbacks: Translate-test yields worse
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: making our novel training strategy feasible. This strategy contributes to the adaptability and effectiveness of the model in cross-lingual language transfer scenarios, where it can categorize text in languages not encountered during training. Thus, the paper delves into the intricacies of cross-lingual text classification, with a particular focus on its application for low-resource languages, exploring methodologies and implications for the development of a robust and adaptable universal cross-lingual model.Index Terms: Low Resource Natural Language Processing, Text Classification, Cross-Lingual, Sentence-BERT, Indic-NLP, Sentence Transformers, Multilingual, Low Resource LanguagesI IntroductionIn the realm of Natural Language Processing, the creation of robust labeled datasets is crucial for effective text classification [8, 11].

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: where datasets are collected from multiple languages, each of which contains language-specific characteristics and structures.The rapid development around English-based datasets has pushed machine performance to be on par with human ability in English tasks, prompting recent works to explore NLP research in other languages Liang et al. (2020); Ruder et al. (2021).However, despite advanced large-scale architectures and high English results, current models notably under-perform in new languages, especially those that are considered low-resource and lack high-quality datasets for fine-tuning.Cross-lingual Transfer, as a result, becomes one of the most important directions in the field.Given a particular task, the goal of Cross-lingual Transfer is to train multilingual models over high-resource source languages that can solve textual tasks in new target languages despite the shifts in linguistic origin.Currently, the most popular and practical approach for IE involves Zero-Shot
