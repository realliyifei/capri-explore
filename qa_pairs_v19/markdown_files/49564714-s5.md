Cross-lingual training approaches in multilingual natural language processing (NLP) address the issue of cross-lingual variation through several strategies that leverage linguistic characteristics, lexical knowledge, and the relationships among multiple languages.

One significant method is the incorporation of lexical knowledge, which is fundamental for enhancing cross-lingual transfer. Studies have shown that employing bilingual dictionaries can help establish word alignments between languages, which allows for training cross-lingual models based on explicit lexical associations. For instance, researchers such as Zhang et al. (2021a) and Wang et al. (2022) utilize bilingual dictionaries to create these alignments, enabling models to leverage known relationships between words in different languages to improve transfer performance [1][2]. Other approaches include code-switching techniques, where certain words in a sentence are replaced with their equivalents from another language, which enriches the training data and promotes better understanding of cross-lingual relationships [1].

Moreover, the transition from single-language to multi-language settings is crucial in dealing with cross-lingual variation. Previous work predominantly focused on single-transfer models using primarily English as the source language [3]. However, current advancements in data gathering and translation models have opened up the possibility of using multiple source languages. This multi-transfer setting is posited to enhance model generalization across languages and improve zero-shot transfer capabilities, where models trained on various languages can still perform well on unseen languages [3]. By exposing models to a variety of linguistic landscapes, cross-lingual training can adapt to regional variations and specific language characteristics.

Furthermore, representation sharing across languages has shown promise in addressing cross-lingual variation. Research indicates that the ability to share parameters allows models to adapt their learning from one language to another effectively. A notable example is seen in advanced multilingual models like mBERT and XLM-R, which enable robust parameter sharing across languages, thus equipping models with generalized representations that function well in diverse languages [4]. These capabilities are critical, especially for low-resource languages where data may be scarce. Cross-lingual transfer methods have demonstrated effectiveness in these contexts as they can utilize knowledge derived from high-resource languages to inform tasks in lower-resource settings.

Lastly, approaches focused on domain-specific challenges further address cross-lingual variation by utilizing language modeling techniques to generate contextually relevant bilingual synthetic data. This method can be particularly useful in specialized areas where there is limited in-domain training data, thus enhancing the translation model’s performance by providing a contextually coherent basis for adaptive translation tasks [5]. 

In summary, cross-lingual training approaches tackle cross-lingual variation through lexical alignment, multi-transfer settings, and the sharing of representations across languages, while also addressing domain-specific language needs, ultimately enhancing their adaptability and performance in multilingual NLP applications.

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: previous work is only limited to the setting of single-transfer between two languages, in which only one source language (predominately English) is utilized.Current advances in translation model and data gathering process have enabled the creation of datasets in many languages, thus multiple source languages should be considered.Intuitively, additional training data from more languages can help improve model’s generalization on downstream tasks, and learning from text in multiple languages may have a positive effect on zero-shot transfer.We believe that multi-transfer setting is the next important step for cross-lingual transfer, both to improve model performance across languages and to provide a more complete picture of multi-linguality in machine learning.In this paper, we focus on what has been missing in previous works by aiming to answer the following three major research questions:Q1: How do the relations in the linguistic landscape affect an IE model’s cross-lingual
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: and cultural context of the language. Projects like Narzary et al. (2022) have brought attention to how crucial it is to provide high-quality datasets that accurately represent language use in everyday situations.In multilingual natural language processing, cross-lingual transfer methods have demonstrated potential, especially when applied to low-resource language tasks. According to research like that of Melvin Johnson (2017), the concept of sharing parameters across languages allows models to acquire representations that function well in a variety of languages. This idea is important because it enables language models to use their English language skills to complete tasks in Marathi through the use of translation-based prompting, which is a type of cross-lingual transfer. Cross-lingual skills are supported by recent advances in multilingual models, such as mBERT Jacob Devlin (2019) and XLM-R Alexis Conneau (2018), which lay a strong platform for further gains in low-resource
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: I examined how to leverage language modelling techniques in general and LLMs in particular to improve translation features that involve human interaction and continuous feedback, such as adaptive MT, terminology-constrained MT, domain-aware automatic post-editing, auto-suggestion and auto-completion. In the second research question, I addressed a common scenario in the translation industry, namely receiving highly specialised projects, where there is hardly any parallel in-domain data. In such scenarios where there is insufficient in-domain data to fine-tune MT models, producing translations that are consistent with the relevant context is challenging. One way to address this question is through domain-specific text generation with LLMs and then fine-tuning an MT model using the generated bilingual in-domain synthetic data. Furthermore, this question overlaps with the first question, since real-time adaptive MT with LLMs can serve as an alternative approach to address in-domain data
