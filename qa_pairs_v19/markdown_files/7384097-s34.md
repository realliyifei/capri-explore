## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know the answer. The context provided does not include any information regarding the specific differences between English and Japanese at the clause and phrase levels, nor does it address how these differences specifically challenge Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT). The passages primarily discuss the general aspects of statistical and neural machine translation, their methodologies, and some common challenges associated with translation tasks, but they do not focus on specific language pairs or the structural nuances that differentiate English from Japanese. Therefore, the context is insufficient to answer the question comprehensively.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: create a statistical translation model by statistically analyzing large amount of parallel corpora for training a model, and then to utilize this model for translation (Lopez, 2008). The phrase-based machine translation has replaced the earlier word-based translation, and has incorporates syntactic data to increase translation accuracy (Och et al., 2000).However, several studies show that there are translation problems for SMT system. Nießen (2000) suggested that translation problems lies in idiomatic expressions, compound words that have to be translated by more than one word, long dependencies, and ambiguous words with different meanings depending on contexts. Compared to neural translations, phrase-based SMT has more translation errors in fluency and accuracy than NMT for English-Dutch parallel corpora according to Van Brussel et al. (2018). Besides, statistical engines provide clearer evidence of syntactic simplification produced by phrase-based SMT (Bizzoni et al., 2020).(3)

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: highly automation and efficiency are its two main problems. (2) A corpus-based system with statistical machine translation (SMT) or phrase-based machine translation (PB- SMT) as the primary method uses machine learning algorithms by using a large amount of parallel corpus as input, overcoming the problem of using labor work to boost efficiency automatically (Lopez, 2008); however, it has issues such as with translation for idiomatic expressions, compound words that have to be translated by more than one word, long dependencies, and ambiguous words with different meanings depending on contexts (Nießen, 2000). (3) The currently predominant neural machine translation (NMT) system has gained the most extensive popularity in machine translation domain. In contrast to more established system SMT, NMT makes use of its architecture and capacity to capture complex sentence dependencies, which suggests that it has a great deal of potential to become a new trend in machine translation.

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: (Lopez, 2008). Initially, rule-based approaches and statistical approaches were prevalent in this field and later neural machine translation (NMT) turned out to be a key milestone in the current era. Compared to other NLG tasks, machine translation requires less information from external sources as it is enforced to preserve the content during the conversion from the source language to the target language. However, enhancing the input to NMT with linguistic features such as morphological analysis, part-of-speech tags, and dependency labels is shown to improve the quality of the task (Sennrich and Haddow, 2016; Chen et al., 2018).Bastings et al. (2017) extended this idea by applying a graph convolution network on the dependency trees to obtain a dense vector representation for the sentence structure. Apart from utilizing the linguistic features,Chen et al. (2018) aided the translation using search engines by extracting similar source sentences and their corresponding translation.
