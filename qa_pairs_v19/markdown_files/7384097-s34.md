## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The provided context does not include specific details about the differences between English and Japanese at the clause and phrase levels. Additionally, it does not address how these differences specifically pose challenges for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBMT). The focus of the passages is primarily on general comparisons between Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and PBMT, along with some insights into issues with translation quality, but it lacks the necessary information to directly answer the question about the specific linguistic features of English and Japanese.

[1]: Passage ID 1: of morphology and syntacticdifferences.To understand in what respects NMT provides better translation quality than PBMT,we perform a detailed analysis of neural vs. phrase-based SMT outputs, leveraginghigh quality post-edits performed by professional translators on theIWSLT data.For the first time, our analysis provides useful insights on whatlinguistic phenomena are best modeled by neural models – such as the reordering of verbs –while pointing out other aspects that remain to be improved.1 IntroductionThe wave of neural models has eventually reached the field of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). After a period in which Neural MT (NMT) was too computationally costly and resource demanding to compete with state-of-the-art Phrase-Based MT (PBMT)111We use the generic term phrase-based MT to cover standard phrase-based, hierarchical and syntax-based SMT approaches.,the situation changed in 2015.For the first time, in the latest edition of IWSLT222International
[2]: Passage ID 2: create a statistical translation model by statistically analyzing large amount of parallel corpora for training a model, and then to utilize this model for translation (Lopez, 2008). The phrase-based machine translation has replaced the earlier word-based translation, and has incorporates syntactic data to increase translation accuracy (Och et al., 2000).However, several studies show that there are translation problems for SMT system. Nießen (2000) suggested that translation problems lies in idiomatic expressions, compound words that have to be translated by more than one word, long dependencies, and ambiguous words with different meanings depending on contexts. Compared to neural translations, phrase-based SMT has more translation errors in fluency and accuracy than NMT for English-Dutch parallel corpora according to Van Brussel et al. (2018). Besides, statistical engines provide clearer evidence of syntactic simplification produced by phrase-based SMT (Bizzoni et al., 2020).(3)

[4]: Passage ID 4: highly automation and efficiency are its two main problems. (2) A corpus-based system with statistical machine translation (SMT) or phrase-based machine translation (PB- SMT) as the primary method uses machine learning algorithms by using a large amount of parallel corpus as input, overcoming the problem of using labor work to boost efficiency automatically (Lopez, 2008); however, it has issues such as with translation for idiomatic expressions, compound words that have to be translated by more than one word, long dependencies, and ambiguous words with different meanings depending on contexts (Nießen, 2000). (3) The currently predominant neural machine translation (NMT) system has gained the most extensive popularity in machine translation domain. In contrast to more established system SMT, NMT makes use of its architecture and capacity to capture complex sentence dependencies, which suggests that it has a great deal of potential to become a new trend in machine translation.
