## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The differences between English and Japanese are significant at both the clause and phrase levels, primarily due to their distinct syntactic structures. At the clause level, Japanese is characterized as a prototypical head-final language, meaning that the head of a phrase typically appears at the end of the clause. This contrasts sharply with English, which follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) order where the head generally appears before its complements and modifiers. The clause-level features in English and Japanese are largely discordant, creating challenges for translation tasks, particularly for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PSMT) [2][4].

At the phrase level, Japanese differs from English in several important ways: it utilizes postpositions instead of prepositions, and its genitive construction is strictly head-final [2][4]. These structural differences complicate the relationships between sentence components, necessitating significant reordering during translation. English and Japanese also exhibit a high frequency of long-range word movements, especially when translating complex sentences [2]. Such movements are difficult to capture using PSMT, which traditionally relies on local reordering techniques [2][4].

Moreover, the hierarchical nature of Japanese sentence structure leads to complex reordering phenomena that PSMT struggles to manage effectively. The challenge arises from the need to reorder elements that may not only be adjacent but also separated by other phrases or clauses [4][5]. Consequently, many of the features at the clause level differ in ways that require a more sophisticated approach than PSMT can provide. In contrast, systems that employ tree-based or syntax-based methods, utilizing pre-ordering or post-ordering strategies, tend to perform better in these situations [1][4]. 

The difficulty with English-Japanese translation often stems from the mismatch in language structure and the constraints imposed by PSMT's reliance on local distortions, which can fail when faced with extensive clause-level differences. For instance, translations involving multiple clause-level adjustments are particularly problematic, as they necessitate a grasp of the overall syntactic hierarchy, which PSMT inherently lacks [4][5]. 

In summary, the discrepancies between English and Japanese at both clause and phrase levels – including differences in head placement, the use of postpositions, and the hierarchical structure of clauses – pose substantial challenges for PSMT. This results in a less effective translation process, prompting a need for more advanced syntactic approaches to adequately handle these complexities [2][4][5].

2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: and Japanese[ Main order: different;  CDiff: 6;  PDiff: 1.5 ] Japanese is the prototypical example of head-final language.In this pair all clause-level features are discordant, while at the phrase level, Japanese differs from English for the use of postpositions and the strictly head-final genitive construction.This pair, like the previous one, is extremely challenging for PSMT due to the hierarchical nature of its reordering phenomena and the high frequency of long-range word movements.Indeed, translation between English and Japanese has spurred a remarkable amount of work on pre-ordering, post-ordering and decoding-time reordering.In 2013 the PatentMT evaluation campaign of the NTCIR conference [\citenameGoto et al.2013a] saw rule-based and hybrid systems largely outperform the purely statistical ones in Japanese-to-English.The highest-ranked SMT submission was actually a combination of three SMT systems including:a baseline PSMT method,a rule-based pre-ordering
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: excluding online systems).At the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation 2014 [\citenameCettolo et al.2014],the best submission was a combination of PSMT with POS- and syntax-based preordering [\citenameSlawik et al.2014], string-to-tree syntax-based SMT and factored PSMT [\citenameBirch et al.2014].English and French[ Main order: same;  CDiff: 0.5;  PDiff: 1.5 ] Most clause-level features have the same values in French as in English,except for the negation which is typically expressed by two words in French: one preceding and one following the verb.171717Pre-verbal negation can be omitted in colloquial French.At the phrase level, differences are found in the location of genitives and adjectives.Thus, English and French have very similar clause-level orders, but reordering is abundant at the local level.This is a case where reordering is mostly well handled by string-based PSMT.As a reference, the three top English-to-French WMT14 systems (official results
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: differences, like French-English,as these mostly imply short or medium-range reordering patterns that can be captured by local distortion.On the other hand, language pairs with many clause-level order differences (e. g. Japanese-English, Turkish-English, Chinese-English)are best handled by tree-based SMT or syntax-based pre-/post-ordering approaches that can handle complex, hierarchical reordering patterns.While this may seem obvious, we notice that, in the literature, the choice of an optimal SMT framework for a new translation task is often driven by costly empirical trials rather than by linguistic knowledge.Finally, the pairs with mostly constituent-level differences and only one or few clause-level differences (e. g. German-English and Arabic-English) do not fit well into either category.In sentences without global reordering, HSMT can underperform PSMT, likely due to the much larger search space explored.At the same time, applying PSMT to such pairs with heuristic
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: a language pair with only phrase-level discordant featuresis likely to be suitable for a PSMT approach, where reordering is managed through local distortion or inside translation units.On the contrary, the presence of many clause-level differences typically calls for a tree-based solution, either at preprocessing or at decoding time.As we will see, some pairs lay on the borderline, with only one or few clause-level differences.Finally, it should be noted that, even among features of the same group, some have more impact on SMT than others due to their frequency or to the average length of their constituents. For instance, the order of noun and genitive is more important than that of adjective and degree word.English and German[ Main order: different;  CDiff=1.5;  PDiff=0.5 ] The main word order of German is SVO or SOV according to the syntactic context (cf. Section 4.2).German also differs from English with respect to the position of oblique phrases and that of the
