## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information specifically addressing the challenges of identifying null complement anaphora in Mandarin compared to English. The passages focus on translation evaluation, speech corpus characteristics, and annotation processes but do not discuss linguistic phenomena such as null complement anaphora or the comparative difficulties in language processing between Mandarin and English. Thus, the context is insufficient to answer the question.

2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: created by professional annotators, they have a tendency to be noisy or incomplete. To mitigate this, we asked two bilingual annotators to reannotate a random selection of 200 English-Chinese and 200 English-Korean sentences respectively.121212We were unable to recruit a bilingual English-Japanese annotator for the English-Japanese data. Specifically, the English-Chinese sentences were annotated by a native Chinese speaker with English as a second language, and the English-Korean sentences were annotated by a native English speaker with Korean as a second language. In accordance with other professionally annotated datasets, the annotators were instructed to make minimal edits to the text (Bryant et al., 2023), and also flag sentences that they were unable to correct or were sentence fragments; these fragments were later excluded from the human-annotated dataset (8 in EN-ZH and 16 in EN-KO). Additionally, annotators were asked to only correct the English tokens; if the non-English
