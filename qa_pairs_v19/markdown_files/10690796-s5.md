## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information regarding the identification of null complement anaphora in Mandarin compared to English. The passages focus on various aspects of natural language processing, including syntax, part-of-speech tagging, ellipsis, and user-generated content, but they do not specifically discuss the syntactic or semantic challenges associated with null complement anaphora in Mandarin or how those challenges compare to English. Therefore, without specific references to these phenomena, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer.

We propose to consider them as multi-functional discourse structuring devices and annotate them as discourse markers, attached to the root, a practice already followed for example in GUM for both spoken data and reported speech within UGC.5 DiscussionIn this final section, we discuss some open questions in which the nature of the phenomena described makes their encoding difficult by means of the current UD scheme.5.1 Elliptical structures and missing elementsIn constituency-based treebanks that contain canonical texts,such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), the annotation of empty elements results from the need to keep traces of movement and long-distance dependencies, usually marked with trace tokens and co-indexing at thelexical level in addition to the actual nodes dominating
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: caused by part-of-speech ambiguity and verb ellipsis. A natural ellipsis recovery of the example shown in Figure 17 would read as ‘Every time there are 3VS1, and suddenly I have -2 P4’. The token "3VS1" stands for “3 versus 1”, namely an uneven combat setting, and ‘P4” refers to a Minecraft character’s protection armor. The token "-2" allows for more than one analysis. The first analysis is the simple reading as number, complementing the noun "P4", in blue in the graph below. A second analysis, in red, treats "-2" as a transcription of moins de (less of), which would be the preferred analysis given the P4 as an armor level interpretation. This example shows the interplay between frequent ellipses, ergographic phenomena and the need for domain knowledge in user-generated data. It also highlights the importance of annotators’ choices when facing elided content as it would have been perfectly acceptable to use the orphan relation to mark the absence of, in this a case, a verbal predicate
