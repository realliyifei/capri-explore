## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The process for selecting papers in the study of mental health conversational agents (CAs) involved a systematic review that adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework [5]. The researchers aimed to comprehensively analyze the academic literature across different domains—specifically computer science (CS) and medicine—to identify trends, disparities, and evaluations related to mental health conversational agents. 

To achieve this, they sourced papers from several prominent databases relevant to their fields of study. These included the ACL Anthology for Natural Language Processing (NLP), AAAI, IEEE, ACM, and PubMed, which were considered integral knowledge areas in the exploration of mental health CAs [2]. The intent was to gather a wide range of papers to facilitate a comparative analysis of methodologies, goals, and findings between the disciplines [2].

During their review, the researchers specifically looked for papers that discussed key characteristics of mental health CAs. In total, they reviewed 534 papers, filtering them down to 136 key papers that met their inclusion criteria [3]. The criteria focused on examining the technology used, ethical considerations, and the application of CAs in mental health contexts [4].

Their findings pointed out a significant disparity in research focus, noting that the majority of CS papers emphasized technical development and evaluation techniques, whereas medical papers centered around healthcare outcomes and clinical applications [3]. This indicates that part of their selection criteria was to ensure the inclusion of diverse perspectives and approaches toward the development and application of conversational agents in mental health care.

In summary, the paper selection process was systematic and structured, involving rigorous criteria to mine relevant literature from key databases, ultimately pinpointing papers that illustrate both the theoretical and practical dimensions of mental health conversational agents across disciplines. The overarching goal was to enable cross-disciplinary learning and improve the practical deployment of these technologies in mental health contexts [5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: approval or consequent considerations in the paper. Out of these 24 papers that lack a statement on ethical concerns, 21 papers are published in the field of CS.5 Discussion5.1 Disparity in Research FocusMental health Conversational Agents require expert knowledge from different domains. However, the papers we reviewed, treat this task quite differently, evidenced by the base rates of the number of papers matching our inclusion criteria. For instance, there are over 28,000 articles published in the ACL Anthology with the keywords “chatbot” or “conversational agent”, which reveals the popularity of this topic in the NLP domain. However, there are only 9 papers related to both mental health and CA, which shows that the focus of NLP researchers is primarily concentrated on the technical development of CA models, less on its applications, including mental health. AAAI shares a similar trend as ACL. However, there are a lot of related papers to mental health CAs in IEEE and ACM,
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: provide an in-depth understanding of advancements and challenges in the CS and medical domains. However, there is a lack of studies that can provide a joint appraisal of developments to enable cross-learning across these domains. With this goal, we consider research papers from medicine (PubMed), NLP (the ACL Anthology), and the rest of CS (ACM, AAAI, IEEE) to examine the disparities in goals, methods, and evaluations of research related to mental health conversational agents.3 Methods3.1 Paper DatabasesWe source papers from eminent databases in the fields of NLP, the rest of CS, and medicine, as these are integral knowledge areas in the study of mental health CA. These databases include the ACL Anthology (referred to as ACL throughout this paper)222https://aclanthology.org/, AAAI333https://aaai.org/aaai-publications/, IEEE444https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/, ACM555https://dl.acm.org/, and PubMed666https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. ACL is recognized as a leading repository that
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: computer science or medicine, leading to a divide in understanding and hindering the sharing of beneficial knowledge between both domains. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive literature review using the PRISMA framework, reviewing 534 papers published in both computer science and medicine. Our systematic review reveals 136 key papers on building mental health-related conversational agents with diverse characteristics of modeling and experimental design techniques. We find that computer science papers focus on LLM techniques and evaluating response quality using automated metrics with little attention to the application while medical papers use rule-based conversational agents and outcome metrics to measure the health outcomes of participants. Based on our findings on transparency, ethics, and cultural heterogeneity in this review, we provide a few recommendations to help bridge the disciplinary divide and enable the cross-disciplinary development of mental health

The rest of this section contextualizes the concepts of NLP and mental health care, providing a foundational understanding of the two fields. The rest of this section provides a quick introduction to the backgrounds of NLP and LLMs, as well as insights into LLM utilities in mental health care.1.1 NLP and LLMNatural Language Processing (NLP) emerged in the 1950s with machine translation systems .[22] Initially, the focus was on rule-based systems that required explicit coding of language rules,[23, 24] which

Employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework Moher et al. (2010), we systematically reviewed 136 pertinent papers to discern the trends and research directions in the domain of mental health conversational agents over the past five years. We find that there is a disparity in research focus and technology across communities, which is also shown in the differences in evaluation. Furthermore, we point out the issues that apply across domains, including transparency and language/cultural heterogeneity.The primary objective of our study is to conduct a systematic and transparent
