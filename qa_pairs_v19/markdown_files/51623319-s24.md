## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information regarding specific methodologies or strategies employed by researchers for annotating non-nominal anaphora or precisely identifying antecedents beyond discussing pronominal anaphora and certain data-cleaning procedures. While it mentions that the focus of the discussed studies was on pronouns and nominal anaphora, there is no detailed information about how non-nominal anaphora is specifically addressed or annotated [1][2][3][4][5].

Finally, the dataset was restricted to pronominal anaphoric expressions, which accounted for approximately 88% of the data. This decision was based on the prevalence of pronominal anaphors in Arabic and the focus of many studies in the field [9, 34, 19, 7, 8]. Applying these data-cleaning procedures ensured a high-quality dataset suitable for training and evaluating the proposed model.4.1.3 Identifying Candidate AntecedentsIn this study, we focus on the pronoun and nominal anaphora resolution; thus, the candidate list is restricted to nouns and noun phrases. The AnATAr corpus used in this study is already segmented into word items, which may be standalone words or phrases, and we have followed this original segmentation. To determine whether a segment is a candidate antecedent, we have used CAMeL [35] along with CoreNLP Stanford [36] taggers as a double-check to identify the

[5]: Passage ID 5: tagging, appear more as instrumental procedures to support those downstream, self-contained applications. To help assess research progress in neural natural language processing, sets of processing tasks, of both kinds, have been bundled together, e.g. in the GLUE benchmark.616161[90].As one such instrumental natural language processing task, possibly contributing or being embedded into downstream applications, anaphora resolution, including coreference resolution, is a procedure by means of which anaphors are paired with their antecedents. It has been addressed with neural approaches626262[61, 92].and has been integrated into natural language processing benchmarks.While related to anaphora resolution, and eventually instrumental to it, determining the set of grammatically admissible antecedents for a given anaphor is a procedure that, as such, has not been addressed yet with neural approaches, to the best of our knowledge.Like many other instrumental tasks, this is a challenge
