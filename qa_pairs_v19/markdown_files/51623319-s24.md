## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Researchers tackle the challenges of annotating non-nominal anaphora primarily through careful data preparation, structured methodologies for identifying candidate antecedents, and the application of advanced computational tools.

First, in the context of studies focusing on non-nominal anaphora, one crucial aspect is to define the boundaries of what is being annotated. For instance, a study had its focus limited to pronominal anaphoric expressions, which made up about 88% of the dataset. This approach was guided by the prevalence of pronominal anaphors in the Arabic language and the specific focus of related studies [2][3][4]. By narrowing down the types of anaphora being considered, researchers can streamline their annotation efforts and improve the quality of their data.

Second, the identification of candidate antecedents is performed with a structured approach. In one research, the candidate list for potential antecedents was restricted to nouns and noun phrases, which allows for focused and manageable annotation tasks. Researchers utilized pre-segmented corpora, such as the AnATAr corpus, which is segmented into word items including standalone words and phrases, facilitating the identification process [2][3][4]. The segmentation previously established in the corpus helps to avoid ambiguity and ensures a clearer framework for annotating non-nominal expressions.

In addition, to enhance accuracy in identifying candidate antecedents, researchers employed powerful linguistic tools. For instance, the use of CAMeL and CoreNLP Stanford taggers allowed for a double-check mechanism that ensures reliability in identifying correct antecedents [2][3]. These computational tools bring advanced natural language processing capabilities, allowing the system to consider various linguistic features that might influence anaphora resolution, such as syntactic and semantic contexts.

Moreover, some researchers are venturing into employing neural networks that leverage sophisticated embeddings for resolving anaphora. For example, a study introduced a neural network architecture comprising components like a shallow parser and a feature vector generator to create word embeddings specifically for enhancing performance in identifying antecedents, achieving a high F1-score in resolution tasks [5]. This model illustrates the cutting-edge methodologies being explored to address the subtleties of non-nominal anaphora.

In summary, the challenges associated with annotating non-nominal anaphora are addressed through a combination of focused definitions of what constitutes anaphora, structured methods of identifying and verifying candidate antecedents, and the integration of advanced computational tools and neural network methodologies. This multi-faceted approach helps researchers navigate the complexities inherent in anaphora resolution, ultimately leading to more precise and reliable outcomes in natural language processing studies.

Finally, the dataset was restricted to pronominal anaphoric expressions, which accounted for approximately 88% of the data. This decision was based on the prevalence of pronominal anaphors in Arabic and the focus of many studies in the field [9, 34, 19, 7, 8].

The architecture chiefly consists of three components, a shallow parser for extracting features, a feature vector generator which produces the word embeddings, and a neural network model which will predict the antecedent mention of an anaphora. The system has been trained and tested on Telugu conversation corpus we generated. Given the advantage of the semantic information in word embeddings and appending actor, gender, number, person and part of plural features the model has reached an F1-score of 86.1 IntroductionThroughout the information era, we have seen a shift in human-computer interactions, from clicks to chats. Conversational agents and dialogue systems are becoming prominent with the daily advances in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Technology will be effective if it can reach for the vaster
