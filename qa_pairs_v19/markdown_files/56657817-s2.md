## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The most common method for linking neural network components to linguistic properties is through a two-step process that involves predicting linguistic properties from the activations of the neural network. The implementation of this method typically begins with the training of a neural network model on a particular task, such as machine translation (MT), during which the model's weights are frozen after training. This trained model is then utilized to generate feature representations by processing a corpus that includes linguistic annotations, and the extracted representations, usually the hidden state activations, are recorded for further analysis [1][4].

In the second step of this approach, another classifier is employed to predict the property of interest, such as part-of-speech (POS) tags. The effectiveness of this classifier serves as a metric for evaluating the quality of the generated representations, and by extension, the performance of the original model. Specifically, the classifier's performance indicates how well the neural network has captured relevant linguistic properties, providing insights into its capabilities [1].

This method has garnered considerable attention within the NLP community, as it allows researchers to systematically investigate and analyze the linguistic information encoded within neural networks. By categorizing analysis work according to various criteria—such as the methods used, the linguistic information targeted, and the specific components of the neural network investigated—scholars can gain a deeper understanding of how different architectures and components relate to linguistic features [4][5]. 

Moreover, there are emerging trends in NLP analysis that compare different network architectures and components to assess their performance in capturing linguistic properties. This reflects an ongoing evolution in the field, as researchers develop new methods and refine existing approaches to enhance interpretability and understanding of neural networks in language processing [2][3].

In summary, the predominant method for linking neural network components to linguistic properties involves a dual process of feature extraction through a trained model followed by classification of linguistic attributes. The evaluation of this approach hinges on the classifier's performance, which serves to gauge the effectiveness of the neural network in capturing and representing linguistic information [1][4].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: next sub-sections, we discuss trends in analysis work along these lines, followed by a discussion of limitations of current approaches.2.1 MethodsThe most common approach for associating neural network components with linguistic properties is to predict such properties from activations of the neural network.Typically, in this approach a neural network model is trained on some task (say, MT) and its weights are frozen. Then, the trained model is used for generating feature representations for another task by running it on a corpus with linguistic annotations and recording the representations (say, hidden state activations). Another classifier is then used for predicting the property of interest (say, part-of-speech (POS) tags). The performance of this classifier is used for evaluating the quality of the generated representations, and by proxy that of the original model.This kind of approach has been used in numerous papers in recent years; see Table LABEL:tab:ling-infofor
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: were common as features in NLP systems are captured in neural networks.As the analysis of neural networks for language is becoming more and more prevalent, neural networks in various NLP tasks are being analyzed; different network architectures and components are being compared; and a variety of new analysis methods are being developed.This survey aims to review and summarize this body of work, highlight current trends, and point to existing lacunae. It organizes the literature into several themes. Section 2 reviews work that targets a fundamental question: what kind of linguistic information is captured in neural networks? We also point to limitations in current methods for answering this question.Section 3 discusses visualization methods, and emphasizes the difficulty in evaluating visualization work.In Section 4 we discuss the compilation of challenge sets, or test suites, for fine-grained evaluation, a methodology that has old roots in NLP.Section 5 deals with the generation
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: field.Why should we analyze our neural NLP models?To some extent, this question falls into the larger question of interpretability in machine learning, which has been the subject of much debate in recent years.222See, for example, the NIPS 2017 debate: www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hW05ZfsUUo. (Accessed on December 11, 2018.)Arguments in favor of interpretability in machine learning usually mention goalslike accountability, trust, fairness, safety, and reliability Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017); Lipton (2016).Arguments against typically stress performance as the most important desideratum. All these arguments naturally apply to machine learning applications in NLP.In the context of NLP,this questionneeds to be understood in light of earlier NLP work, often referred to as feature-rich or feature-engineered systems. In some of these systems, features are more easily understood by humans – they can be morphological properties, lexical classes, syntactic categories, semantic relations,
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: identifying linguistic information (Section 2) contain many examples for these kinds of analysis.2 What linguistic information is captured in neural networksNeural network models in NLP are typically trained in an end-to-end manner on input-output pairs, without explicitly encoding linguistic features. Thus a primary questions is the following: what linguistic information is captured in neural networks?When examining answers to this question, it is convenient to consider three dimensions:which methods are used for conducting the analysis,what kind of linguistic information is sought, and which objects in the neural network are being investigated.Table LABEL:tab:ling-info(in the supplementary materials) categorizes relevant analysis work according to these criteria.In the next sub-sections, we discuss trends in analysis work along these lines, followed by a discussion of limitations of current approaches.2.1 MethodsThe most common approach for associating neural
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: formal languages Das et al. (1992); Casey (1996); Gers and Schmidhuber (2001); Bodén and Wiles (2002); Chalup and Blair (2003). This trend continues today, with research into modern architectures and what formal languages they can learn Weiss et al. (2018); Bernardy (2018); Suzgun et al. (2019), or the formal properties they possess Chen et al. (2018b).8 ConclusionAnalyzing neural networks has become a hot topic in NLP research. This survey attempted to review and summarize as much of the current research as possible, while organizing it along several prominent themes. We have emphasized aspects in analysis that are specific to language – namely, what linguistic information is captured in neural networks, which phenomena they are successful at capturing, and where they fail. Many of the analysis methods are general techniques from the larger machine learning community, such as visualization via saliency measures, or evaluation by adversarial examples. But even those sometimes
