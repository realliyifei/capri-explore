## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not include any information regarding the W&I+LOCNESS corpus, its usage, or its application in the annotation and evaluation of grammatical errors in essays. The passages focus primarily on various studies, systems, and corpora related to grammatical error correction but do not mention the W&I+LOCNESS corpus specifically. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to your question based on the given context.

The essays, which are approximately C1 level, are written on a diverse range of topics including technology, healthcare, and finance, and were each corrected by a single annotator who identified and classified each edit according to a framework of 28 error types. NUCLE was used as the official training corpus of the CoNLL-2013 and CoNLL-2014 shared tasks (Ng et al., 2013, 2014) as well as one of the official training datasets of the BEA-2019 shared task (Bryant et al., 2019). The CoNLL-2013 and CoNLL-2014 test sets were annotated under similar conditions to NUCLE and respectively consist of 50 essays each (∼similar-to\sim30k words) on the topics of i) surveillance technology and population aging, and ii) genetic testing and social media.
