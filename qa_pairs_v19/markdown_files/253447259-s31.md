## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Data augmentation has had a notable impact on the development and performance of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems, particularly in addressing challenges associated with low-resource languages like Indonesian and improving model training through enhanced data quality.

One way data augmentation is applied in GEC is through the generation of synthetic data. Studies have shown that models trained only on synthetic data can still exhibit positive outcomes in GEC tasks, suggesting that such data can complement or even substitute human-annotated datasets under certain conditions [5]. For instance, the BackTranscription (BTS)-based GEC model utilizes synthetic data generation methods, which have been influential in enhancing the capabilities of GEC systems by providing additional training resources [5].

Moreover, advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), including improvements from data augmentation techniques, allow for the integration of information from multiple hypotheses to correct errors more effectively. This has contributed to the development of Generative Error Correction methods, which utilize large pools of hypothesis-transcription pairs for training, thereby generalizing well across various datasets [3]. Improved performance in GEC can thus be linked to these methodologies, as they foster robustness in the model by enabling it to learn from an enriched data landscape.

Data quality control measures like noise injection and balanced data also play a role in enhancing the performance of GEC models [5]. These methods ensure that the training data is not only abundant but also of high quality. By introducing variability and simulating different types of errors, such techniques can prepare models to handle real-world scenarios better, increasing transcription and correction accuracy.

Furthermore, the emphasis on focusing GEC research on low-resource languages like Indonesian highlights a gap in the literature that data augmentation can help to fill. Despite the abundance of speakers, the limited linguistic resources available for Indonesian language processing present challenges for model training and performance [2]. Employing data augmentation techniques can mitigate some of these challenges by generating the necessary language resources to improve the training of GEC models in such low-resource environments.

In summary, data augmentation has positively influenced the development and performance of GEC systems by generating synthetic data, enhancing model training through increased data quality, and enabling models to better generalize across various language contexts. By addressing the shortcomings of existing datasets, particularly in low-resource languages, data augmentation techniques facilitate the overall advancement of GEC technology [1] [2] [5].

Furthermore, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing existing large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to streamline corpus annotation efforts in GEC tasks. The results demonstrate significant potential for enhancing the performance of LLMs in low-resource language settings.

2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: (Baviskar and Bahekar, 2019). Grammatical errors diminish the readability of texts and adversely impact the reader’s experience. So grammatical error correction (GEC) has become a significant research orientation within the field of natural language processing (NLP).Numerous NLP researchers have primarily concentrated on GEC in universal languages like English and Chinese. Nevertheless, there is little research especially focused on Indonesian, which is categorized as a low-resource language belonging to the Malay-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. Despite having a population of over 270 million speakers, Indonesian still has severely limited linguistic resources, which poses challenges for NLP research. And the limitation of resources adversely impacts the progress of Indonesian NLP technology and GEC research in Indonesian.Currently, limited attention has been concentrated on GEC tasks for Indonesian language processing.

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: rise of large language models (LLMs) with advanced reasoning capabilities has opened possibilities beyond simple rescoring. This has led to the development of Generative Error Correction (GEC) Chen et al. (2024), where models are trained to correct errors in the best hypothesis by leveraging information from other hypotheses, ultimately improving transcription accuracy.Conventional Generative Error Correction (GEC) models are typically trained by pooling hypothesis-transcription pairs from various ASR systems and datasets, with the expectation that they will generalize well across diverse data at test time Chen et al. (2024); Hu et al. (2024a); Ghosh et al. (2024b). However, we identify key limitations in this approach. Previous work has primarily focused on foundational or semi-open-source models (e.g., Whisper Radford et al. (2023)). To explore these limitations, we conducted several single-domain, single-dataset experiments (see Table 1), training GEC models on the same datasets

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: data quality control using fully synthetic data. This paper analyzes whether a model trained only on synthetic data rather than human-annotated data can still demonstrate a positive impact in a data-centric approach.To do this, we employ the grammatical error correction (GEC) task as it is one of the closely related tasks to the real-world. We conduct experiments on the GEC task using two models: (1) a BackTranscription (BTS) (Park et al., 2021b)-based GEC model, which is a synthetic data generation method proposed in recent speech recognition post-processing, and (2) a GEC model for learning from real-world data (Park et al., 2020). To analyze the impact of data quality control on performance, we apply methods such as noise injection (Ivanovs et al., 2021) and balanced data (Park et al., 2022a; Chen et al., 2021) to both models and compare their results.Moreover, there have been studies on the effectiveness of synthetic data based on self-supervised learning (Ng et al., 2020;
