## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Stance detection plays a crucial role in the context of rumor detection and debunking within the realms of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and social media analysis. This technique is essential for understanding public sentiment and the dissemination of information, particularly when addressing contentious issues that can lead to the spread of rumors. 

Rumor detection relies on the ability to assess the stance of individuals towards specific claims or news items as they are shared on social media platforms. By analyzing users' posts, stance detection helps identify whether individuals support, oppose, or remain neutral about the information in question. Understanding these stance tendencies provides significant advantages in political analysis, public opinion polling, and rumor identification [1] [2]. A clear categorization of stances is critical for distinguishing supportive or oppositional responses to rumors, thus informing strategies for debunking false information and enhancing public discourse [2].

Formally, stance detection can be defined as the task of determining an author's attitude towards a given target—this can include any entity, concept, or event being discussed. The attitudes are typically classified into distinct categories, such as "Favor," "Against," and "Neither." Additionally, some frameworks may include "Neutral" as a fourth category, where the target may not be explicitly mentioned in the text [5]. Stance detection thus operates as a classification problem wherein the text is analyzed to assign it to one of these categorical labels [5].

There are two main levels at which stance detection can be applied: 

1. **Statement Level Stance Detection**: This involves predicting the stance expressed in a singular piece of text, such as a tweet or forum post. At this level, features are extracted from the text to inform the classification [4].

2. **User Level Stance Detection**: This broader approach predicts a user's overall stance on a topic by analyzing multiple posts from that user. It can also take into account various user attributes, thereby providing a more holistic understanding of their opinions [4].

Over the years, techniques for stance detection have evolved significantly. Initially rooted in rule-based approaches, the field has moved toward more robust machine learning and deep learning models, which have shown improved efficacy in processing complex datasets and identifying patterns in stance classification [3] [5]. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) further enhances this capability, enabling nuanced analysis of user-generated content, which reflects the evolving landscape of online discourse [2].

In summary, stance detection is essential for tackling rumor detection and debunking by enabling the classification of public attitudes towards claims or misinformation. Through its structured definitions and categories, it facilitates the extraction of valuable insights from social media, helping to mitigate the spread of false narratives and enabling informed public discourse [1] [3].

This process, relying on nuanced textual analysis across platforms like X (formerly Twitter), presents both opportunities and challenges for accurate interpretation hasan-ng-2013-stance; 10.1145/3369026; DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2006-03644, key to gaining insights into public sentiment and societal trends.

The increasing availability of massive amounts of textual data has created a need to automatically analyze the opinions, emotions, and stances expressed. This is because understanding the stance tendencies of the public offers significant benefits for political analysis, public opinion polling, and rumor detection. Hence, stance detection has been an active topic in NLP. Stance detection aims to identify the author’s attitude or stance towards a specific target (such as an entity, concept, or event)Mohammad, typically classified into categories such as support, opposition, or neutrality.Figure 1: The overall architecture of CoS.Recently, the advents of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT111https://chat.openai.com/, GPT-4Achiam et al.

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: into the various forms of stance detection, it is essential to distinguish between the different levels at which stance detection is applied. In the literature, stance classification is applied at two levels:•Statement level stance detection: Here, the goal is to predict the stance expressed in a piece of text. This approach is common in NLP research, where features are extracted from text such as forum posts (Murakami and Raymond, 2010) or tweets (Mohammad et al., 2016b).•User level stance detection: Here, the objective is to predict a user’s overall stance on a given topic, which can then be achieved by looking at multiple posts from a user, rather than a single post. This method can also incorporate various user attributes alongside the text in their posts (Aldayel and Magdy, 2019b).Stance detection is crucial in analytical studies aimed at gauging public opinion on social media, especially on political and social issues. These issues are often contentious,
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: detection is a classification problem where the stance of the author of the text is sought in the form of a category label from this set: {Favor, Against, Neither}.Occasionally, the category label of Neutral is also added to the set of stance categories and the target may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the text.Researchers approach this task by converting it into a text classification task.Stance detection studies originally focused on parliamentary debates and gradually shifted to social media contents including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, online blogs and etc. The techniques to approach these problems also evolve with time.Early research works on stance detection from the 1950s mainly adopted rule-based techniques Anand et al. (2011); Walker et al. (2012).Since the 1990s, machine learning based models gradually replaced small scale rule-based methods.Traditional machine learning models build text classifiers for stance detection based on selected features.The
