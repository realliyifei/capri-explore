## I don't know?: False

Stance detection plays an integral role in rumor detection and debunking within the context of natural language processing (NLP). By analyzing the opinions and attitudes expressed in user-generated content, stance detection can help identify and classify the perspectives surrounding a rumor. This understanding is crucial for assessing public sentiment and facilitating effective communication strategies aimed at debunking false information.

Formally, stance detection is defined as the process of identifying an author's attitude or stance towards a particular target, which can be an entity, concept, or event. The stances are typically categorized into three primary labels: Favor, Against, and Neither. Sometimes an additional label, Neutral, is used to provide more granularity in stance classifications [1][2][5]. For instance, in the context of a rumor, a message might express support for the rumor, oppose it, or may be neutral regarding its veracity.

The application of stance detection in rumor detection involves analyzing social media interactions where rumors are likely to spread. Understanding the attitudes surrounding a rumor allows researchers and analysts to gauge the public's response, which can help to either validate or discredit the rumor in question. This capability is particularly useful for political analysis and public opinion polling, wherein stance detection can reveal whether the public is trending towards support, opposition, or neutrality on a controversial subject matter, such as misinformation [2].

Furthermore, stance detection is conducted at different levels: statement-level and user-level. Statement-level stance detection involves predicting the stance expressed in individual pieces of text, while user-level stance detection aims to assess a user’s overall attitude concerning a topic by analyzing multiple posts from that individual. This nuanced analysis can contribute significantly to rumor detection by aggregating a user's sentiments over time, which can shed light on the evolution of public opinion regarding a specific rumor [4].

Historically, the approaches to stance detection have progressed from rule-based methods and traditional machine learning techniques to modern deep learning models. Early studies predominantly utilized rule-based techniques, but with the advent of machine learning from the 1990s onwards, researchers began to employ more sophisticated models that analyze larger datasets and identify complex patterns in stance expression [3][5]. The recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have further enhanced the capabilities of stance detection. These models demonstrate outstanding performance in various NLP tasks, including stance identification, which can be pivotal in addressing the dynamics of rumor dissemination on social media [2].

In summary, stance detection provides essential insights into public sentiment on rumors by categorizing user opinions and facilitating both rumor detection and debunking efforts through well-defined classifications. Understanding these stances enables stakeholders to respond more effectively to misinformation as it proliferates across digital platforms.

This is because understanding the stance tendencies of the public offers significant benefits for political analysis, public opinion polling, and rumor detection. Hence, stance detection has been an active topic in NLP. Stance detection aims to identify the author’s attitude or stance towards a specific target (such as an entity, concept, or event)Mohammad, typically classified into categories such as support, opposition, or neutrality.Figure 1: The overall architecture of CoS.Recently, the advents of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT111https://chat.openai.com/, GPT-4Achiam et al.

[4]: Passage ID 4: into the various forms of stance detection, it is essential to distinguish between the different levels at which stance detection is applied. In the literature, stance classification is applied at two levels:•Statement level stance detection: Here, the goal is to predict the stance expressed in a piece of text. This approach is common in NLP research, where features are extracted from text such as forum posts (Murakami and Raymond, 2010) or tweets (Mohammad et al., 2016b).•User level stance detection: Here, the objective is to predict a user’s overall stance on a given topic, which can then be achieved by looking at multiple posts from a user, rather than a single post. This method can also incorporate various user attributes alongside the text in their posts (Aldayel and Magdy, 2019b).Stance detection is crucial in analytical studies aimed at gauging public opinion on social media, especially on political and social issues. These issues are often contentious,
[5]: Passage ID 5: detection is a classification problem where the stance of the author of the text is sought in the form of a category label from this set: {Favor, Against, Neither}.Occasionally, the category label of Neutral is also added to the set of stance categories and the target may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the text.Researchers approach this task by converting it into a text classification task.Stance detection studies originally focused on parliamentary debates and gradually shifted to social media contents including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, online blogs and etc. The techniques to approach these problems also evolve with time.Early research works on stance detection from the 1950s mainly adopted rule-based techniques Anand et al. (2011); Walker et al. (2012).Since the 1990s, machine learning based models gradually replaced small scale rule-based methods.Traditional machine learning models build text classifiers for stance detection based on selected features.The
