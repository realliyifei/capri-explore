## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

Centering Theory (CT), introduced by Grosz et al. in the 1990s, is primarily concerned with the organization of discourse, specifically how topics are managed across utterances in a text. The key assumptions of Centering Theory include the concepts of the backward-looking center and forward-looking center, along with the idea of coherence being determined by the flow of attention among entities within discourse.

1. **Key Assumptions**:
   - **Reference Types**: While CT emphasizes inter-sentential references (references between sentences), it is less effective for intra-sentential references (references within a sentence) [3].
   - **Centers of Attention**: Two types of centers are defined: the backward-looking center, which represents the current topic, and the forward-looking center, indicating what the next topic could be [4]. The dynamics of these centers can shift based on how discourse unfolds.
   - **Continuity and Shifts**: CT identifies three phases of center identification‚Äîcenter continuation, center retaining, and center-shifting. The theory posits that coherence is achieved when there are more "continue" transitions (where the same topic continues to be the center) than "shift" transitions (where the topic changes) [5].

2. **Coherence Modelling**: 
   Centering Theory approaches coherence through the idea that successful communication involves the audience's ability to track these centers of attention. The rules governing centering include:
   - **Rule 1** posits that the center of attention is the entity most likely to be referenced with a pronoun, which indicates its salience in the discourse.
   - **Rule 2** states that there's a preference to maintain the same entity as the center across sentences, enhancing coherence [4].

3. **Discourse Salience**: 
   Discourse salience refers to how entities are likely to be referenced based on their prominence within the ongoing conversation. An important aspect of CT is that an entity‚Äôs salience makes it more probable that it will be referred to as a pronoun [5]. Giv√≥n elaborates on this concept, stating that salience influences language processing and comprehension [5].

4. **Evaluation and Application**: 
   Evaluation of Centering Theory has been conducted on datasets to assess its effectiveness in understanding discourse coherence. Despite its strengths, one concern is that CT is designed for high precision, leading to possible limitations in recall, particularly when applied to certain corpora [3]. The computational models that draw upon these theories have relevant applications in areas like text generation, summarization, and dialog systems, showing the practical implications of understanding coherence through the lens of centering [2].

In summary, Centering Theory's prominent assumptions revolve around the management of discourse topics through centers of attention, continuity of discourse, and the implications of salience on anaphora resolution. Its framework illustrates how coherence is articulated in human language, which is critical for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

Computational models that can assess coherence have applications in text generation and ranking, such as summarization, machine translation, essay scoring and dialog systems.Researchers have proposed a number of formal theories of discourse coherence, which have inspired the development of many coherence models ‚Äì both traditional and neural ones. Inspired by the Centering Theory Grosz et¬†al. (1995), the entity based local models Barzilay and Lapata (2008); Elsner and Charniak (2011b) formulate coherence in terms of syntactic roles (e.g.,¬†subject, object) of entities in nearby sentences. Another branch of models Pitler and Nenkova (2008); Lin et¬†al. (2011); Feng et¬†al.

As a result of this, the defined rules performed well on the narratives dataset but CogNIAC failed to meet a high precision when evaluated on the MUC-6 corpus.The centering theory¬†(Grosz et¬†al, 1995; Walker et¬†al, 1998) was a discourse-based algorithm that took a psycholinguistic approach to AR. Centering theory was an attractive algorithm for researchers mainly because the discourse information it requires could be obtained from structural properties of utterances alone. Thus, eliminating the need for any extra-linguistic semantic information. One possible disadvantage of CT was its preference for inter-sentential references as compared to intra-sentential references. In some ways we can even consider that Lappin and Leass algorithm incorporated centering theory‚Äôs discourse constraint and modified it by
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: The backward looking center was defined as the current topic and the preferred center was the potential new topic. The three major phases in center identification were: center continuation, where same center was continued for the next sentence in discourse, center retaining, wherein there was a possible indication for shift of the center and center-shifting wherein there was a complete shift in the center involved. As summarized by¬†(Kibble, 2001) there were two key rules governing centering theory. The Rule 1 stated that the center of attention was the entity that was most likely to be pronominalized and Rule 2 stated that there was a preference given to keep the same entity as the center of attention. Apart from these rules various discourse filters were also applied to filter out good and bad anchors and the remaining good ones were ranked according to their transition type. The centering algorithm was evaluated on Hobb‚Äôs datasets and some other Human-Keyword task oriented databases.
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: the most salient entity changes (i.e., Cfsubscriptùê∂ùëìC_{f}), the forward-looking center stays the same, whereas the transition from utterance¬†16 to¬†16 is a SHIFT transition because of the change of backward-looking transition. Intuitively, a discourse with more CONTINUE transitions is more coherent than the one with more SHIFT transitions.Though Centering Theory is not a theory of Anaphora Resolution, Anaphora Resolution can directly benefit from modeling transitions, which provides certain information about the preference for the referents of pronouns (e.g., in a coherent segment, centers co-refer; see¬†Joshi et¬†al. (2006) for more discussion about the relation between Centering Theory and Anaphora Resolution).3.1.3 Discourse SalienceA prominent strand of work in psycholinguistics investigates how human beings use anaphora. A referent is more likely to be realized as a pronoun if it is salient in a given discourse¬†(Giv√≥n, 1983) (aka. discourse salience). Discourse salience is
