(2023a) developed a bipartite typology for L2 feedback which includes abstract tags (e.g., idiom, language transfer, praise, etc.) and grammatical pattern tags (e.g., conditional, possessive, relative clause, etc.).A recent study explored the application of LLMs for grammatical error explanation Song et al. (2024). The study employed a two-step pipeline that first used fine-tuned and prompted LLMs to extract structured atomic token edits. Subsequently, GPT-4 OpenAI (2024) was prompted to explain each edit. Despite its novelty and appeal, this approach has several limitations, i.e., it a) can only be applied to sentences but not longer compositions; b) only consists of four operation edit-level types, namely insert, delete, replace, and relocate; and c) needs manual annotators to check that the error explanations are correct, which is generally a costly operation. It is also worth mentioning the recent work by Stahl et al. (2024) on joint essay scoring and feedback generation,
