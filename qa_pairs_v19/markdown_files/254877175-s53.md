R2L tokenization leads to improved model performance on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (March 2023 models), which we show is due to tokenization alignment between addends and answer through various controls and error analyses.

## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information about recent studies or findings specifically related to the assessment of subword tokenization techniques in handling numeracy within language models. The passages discuss topics such as natural language processing capabilities, research questions in the field, and the evaluation of large language models generally, but they do not address subword tokenization techniques or their implications for numeracy. Therefore, there is insufficient information to formulate a precise answer to your question.

NLP has been used broadly to summarize text documents, deduce author sentiment, solve symbolic math problems, and even generate programming code 22, 23, 24, 25. The effectiveness of NLP is predicated on the view that (human) languages consist of a structured symbolic syntax with a defined set of assembly rules of basic units of a language known as ”tokens” (e.g., characters, words, or punctuation) that can be pieced together to form higher/̄order constructs such as sentences or paragraphs. The structured output of such a system reflect the grammar, conventions, and styles of the associated languages. Tokens, which are represented computationally in NLP models as mathematical vectors, are manipulated and processed to encode ’meanings’, such that tokens of similar ”meaning” are mathematically closer together in vector space. By analyzing a large collection of data, NLP methods are used to infer emergent

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: human-like text, answer complex questions, and perform a wide array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Models such as GPT (Achiam et al., 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), Baichuan (Yang et al., 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), GLM (Du et al., 2022), and DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024) have set new standards, demonstrating exceptional performance across various benchmarks. These models have been widely adopted in both academic and industrial settings, highlighting their versatility and potential. However, the evaluation of LLMs is a multifaceted challenge that extends beyond mere accuracy in answering questions. It involves assessing their ability to understand context, generate coherent and relevant responses, and apply specialized knowledge effectively.Evaluation BenchmarksThe evaluation of LLMs has traditionally relied on established NLP benchmark datasets, such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), which focus
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: as work to date has primarily focused on English or other high-resource languages Mondal et al. (2022) but devoted less efforts towards minority languages. Additionally, the lack of human evaluation of NLP-based health systems has made it challenging to measure their effectiveness in the real world. Current automatic evaluation metrics do not necessarily speak to patient outcomes. Hence, human-centric studies must be conducted in evaluating the efficacy of NLP-powered tools in healthcare.Research Directions.1.Healthcare benchmark construction. Although the documentation of recent LLMs reports very high performance for various medical question answering benchmarks, or medical licensing texts, there are many other tasks in healthcare that lack the data required to achieve similarly good performance. Access to medical datasets is often limited because of privacy issues, and therefore other approaches may be required to compile such benchmarks. Synthetic datasets are one such
