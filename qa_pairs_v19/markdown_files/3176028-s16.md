## Answer

I don't know. The provided context focuses on various aspects of discourse analysis, natural language processing methodologies, and references to distinct research works within the field. However, it does not specifically elaborate on how the discourse-cohesion approach employs cohesive ties in the context of coreference resolution. There are no details or explanations regarding the mechanisms or strategies employed in cohesive ties for this specific purpose, making it impossible to construct a precise and supported answer.
