## Answer

I don't know. The context provided does not include specific information about the advantages and difficulties associated with using conditional generation methods for sentence-level data augmentation in NLP. While it discusses general improvements in NLP through text augmentation and raises questions about performance, filtering, and sequencing, it does not explicitly address the pros and cons of conditional generation methods. The context lacks details on how such methods perform in comparison to other approaches or any challenges unique to them. Therefore, the information is insufficient to answer the question effectively.

[3]: Passage ID 3: processing (NLP) tasks. This challenge is especially prominent in the few-shot learning scenario, where the data in the target domain is generally much scarcer and of lowered quality. A natural and widely-used strategy to mitigate such challenges is to perform data augmentation to better capture the data invariance and increase the sample size. However, current text data augmentation methods either can’t ensure the correct labeling of the generated data (lacking faithfulness) or can’t ensure sufficient diversity in the generated data (lacking compactness), or both. Inspired by the recent success of large language models, especially the development of ChatGPT, which demonstrated improved language comprehension abilities, in this work, we propose a text data augmentation approach based on ChatGPT (named AugGPT). AugGPT rephrases each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar but semantically different samples. The augmented samples can then be used in downstream
