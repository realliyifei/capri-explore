## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Graph-based methods enhance the representation and encoding of database schema structures in text-to-SQL tasks by utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) and specialized encoders to capture and leverage the relationships among various database elements. One key advancement is the introduction of schema dependency graphs, which facilitate the understanding of how database elements interact with each other, a crucial component for generating accurate SQL queries from natural language input [2] [4].

These graph-based methods integrate the relationships inherent in database schemas into the encoding process, thus allowing for a more nuanced representation of elements and their interactions. For instance, the utilization of a database schema interaction graph encoder enables the model to incorporate historical interaction information among schema items. This approach significantly improves the model's ability to discern the relevance and dependencies among schemas during the decoding phase by introducing mechanisms that weigh the importance of different vocabulary items based on their relational context [3] [4]. The result is a more context-aware generation of SQL tokens that can tackle complex, context-dependent queries effectively.

Notably, studies have demonstrated that these advancements lead to notable improvements in performance. For example, models employing these graph-based strategies achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets like SParC and CoSQL, indicating their effectiveness in addressing the challenges inherent in the text-to-SQL conversion task [3]. Additionally, graph-based approaches such as Graphix-T5 have shown improvements by combining transformer models with relational GNNs to integrate semantic information that captures the schema relationships, resulting in high accuracy rates in SQL query generation [4].

Overall, the integration of graph-based techniques allows for a more sophisticated understanding of the semantics of the database schema, facilitating improved generalization to diverse and complex questions that typical rule-based or simpler models would struggle to answer effectively [1] [5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: (NLP) research communities have invested considerable effort in addressing these challenges. Early Text-to-SQL approaches were predominantly based on predefined rules or templates (Baik et al., 2020; Quamar et al., 2022; Sen et al., 2020). These methods conceptualized the conversion task as a straightforward mapping exercise from natural language to SQL. Other techniques approached the problem from a sequence-to-sequence learning perspective, applying encoder-decoder models to capture the translation process (Cai et al., 2017; Popescu et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2022). However, recent advancements have seen the emergence of hybrid methods that synergize the strengths of both database and NLP technologies. These include approaches that consider schema relations (Hui et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a; Qi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2019, 2022b; Zheng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023d) and others that incorporate syntax parsing techniques (Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023b; Scholak et al., 2021;

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: propose a database schema interaction graph encoder to utilize historicalal information of database schema items. In decoding phase, we introduce a gate mechanism to weigh the importance of different vocabularies and then make the prediction of SQL tokens. We evaluate our model on the benchmark SParC and CoSQL datasets, which are two large complex context-dependent cross-domain text-to-SQL datasets. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the two datasets. The comparison and ablation results demonstrate the efficacy of our model and the usefulness of the database schema interaction graph encoder.1 IntroductionThe Text-to-SQL task aims to translate natural language texts into SQL queries. Users who do not understand SQL grammars can benefit from this task and acquire information from databases by just inputting natural language texts. Previous works Li and Jagadish (2014); Xu et al. (2017); Yu et al.
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: since the Completion of The ProjectAfter our model was completed in August 2022, some research groups developed new architectures based on T5, and these models further improved the accuracy of the text-to-SQL parser, taking advantage of database schema linkages. For example, Graphix-T5 [5] combined the standard T5 encoding layer with semi-pretrained relational graph neural network (GNN) to integrate semantic information and develop scheme linkage relationship, which achieved 74% accuracy rate in exact match text-to-SQL evaluation. While most of the groups focus on how the NLP questions can generate the corresponding SQL, Zhao et al [40] improved the model from SQL to text direction (SQL-to-text), they identified the existing limitation of current synthesis methods and proposed the synthesis framework which used intermediate representation (IR) to preserve the important information from the query to construct the correspondence text of the natural language query (NLQ) as the parallel

[5]:  Passage ID 5: (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), a sketch of the evolutionary process is shown in Fig. 2.II-B1 Rule-based MethodsEarly text-to-SQL systems relied heavily on rule-based methods [11, 12, 26], where manually crafted rules and heuristics were used to map natural language questions to SQL queries.These approaches often involved extensive feature engineering and domain-specific knowledge.While rule-based methods achieved success in specific simple domains, they lacked the flexibility and generalization capabilities needed to handle diverse and complex questions.II-B2 Deep Learning-based ApproachesWith the rise of deep neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models and encoder-decoder structures, such as LSTMs [78] and transformers [17], were adapted to generate SQL queries from natural language input [79, 19].Typically, RYANSQL [19] introduced techniques like intermediate representations and sketch-based slot filling to handle complex questions and improve cross-domain
