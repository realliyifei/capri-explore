## Answer

Graph-based methods play a significant role in improving the representation and encoding of database schema structures in text-to-SQL tasks by leveraging the inherent relationships among database elements. These methods are particularly advantageous as they move beyond traditional linear representations of schemas, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the complex interdependencies found within a database.

Firstly, by representing the database schema as a graph structure, graph neural networks (GNNs) can capture schema dependencies more effectively. This approach helps in understanding how different components of the schema, such as tables, columns, and their relationships, interact with one another. For instance, utilizing schema dependency graphs allows GNNs to model these relationships, offering a structured way to interpret the input natural language queries and their corresponding SQL outputs [1] [4].

Moreover, graph-based methods enhance schema linking and encoding, which are critical for accurately connecting components of a natural language question to the appropriate schema elements. They achieve this by encoding token types such as tables, columns, or specific values in a way that reflects their roles and relationships within the schema context [4] [5]. This results in an enriched understanding of the schema, which is vital for generating accurate SQL queries from diverse and complex input text.

Additionally, the introduction of mechanisms like a gate mechanism in the decoding phase allows these models to weigh the importance of different vocabulary items, effectively enhancing prediction accuracy for SQL tokens. This is particularly useful in complex scenarios where determining the relevance of certain schema elements in relation to the input question is crucial [2]. Such mechanisms enable a more selective and context-aware generation of SQL queries, leveraging historical interactions and dependencies found within the schema.

The evaluation of these graph-based approaches has shown significant performance improvements over previous models. For example, models implementing a database schema interaction graph encoder have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on complex context-dependent text-to-SQL datasets, such as SParC and CoSQL, indicating the efficacy of graph-based methods in addressing the intricacies associated with various schemas [2]. 

In summary, graph-based methods improve the representation and encoding of database schema structures in text-to-SQL tasks by capturing the complex interrelationships among schema elements, facilitating effective schema linking, and enhancing the contextual awareness of model predictions through mechanisms that prioritize relevant vocabulary in SQL generation [1][2][5].

[2]: Passage ID 2: propose a database schema interaction graph encoder to utilize historicalal information of database schema items. In decoding phase, we introduce a gate mechanism to weigh the importance of different vocabularies and then make the prediction of SQL tokens. We evaluate our model on the benchmark SParC and CoSQL datasets, which are two large complex context-dependent cross-domain text-to-SQL datasets. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the two datasets. The comparison and ablation results demonstrate the efficacy of our model and the usefulness of the database schema interaction graph encoder.1 IntroductionThe Text-to-SQL task aims to translate natural language texts into SQL queries. Users who do not understand SQL grammars can benefit from this task and acquire information from databases by just inputting natural language texts. Previous works Li and Jagadish (2014); Xu et al. (2017); Yu et al.
[3]: Passage ID 3: (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), a sketch of the evolutionary process is shown in Fig. 2.II-B1 Rule-based MethodsEarly text-to-SQL systems relied heavily on rule-based methods [11, 12, 26], where manually crafted rules and heuristics were used to map natural language questions to SQL queries.These approaches often involved extensive feature engineering and domain-specific knowledge.While rule-based methods achieved success in specific simple domains, they lacked the flexibility and generalization capabilities needed to handle diverse and complex questions.II-B2 Deep Learning-based ApproachesWith the rise of deep neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models and encoder-decoder structures, such as LSTMs [78] and transformers [17], were adapted to generate SQL queries from natural language input [79, 19].Typically, RYANSQL [19] introduced techniques like intermediate representations and sketch-based slot filling to handle complex questions and improve cross-domain
[4]: Passage ID 4: in [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] utilized GNNs in their models to represent schema as a graph structure.Neural language modelling typically use word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe [20] as first layers [14, 13, 21, 22, 23]. This layer provides association and similarity of words prior to training [2]. These methods improve the performance of downstream NLP tasks but lack the ability to represent the contextual meaning of the words[24].Typical models that tackle text-to-SQL tasks come under an encoder-decoder scheme. Some researchers have shown that input and output adjustment can improve the accuracy of the model[2]. Several researchers have utilized different methods during encoding to improve schema linking and schema encoding. Encoding token types [12, 25] such as table, column, or value can be used to represent the linkage between the question and the schema. Graph-based methods are also widely used to represent the rich structural information of database schemas [9]. S2SQL [17]
[5]: Passage ID 5: mainly rely on bi-structured models. These approaches typically use LSTM-based and Transformer-based models to generate SQL queries by learning a contextual representation between natural language questions and database tables. In this context, this paper also discusses a variety of existing frameworks and techniques, including models based on techniques such as graph neural networks, table semantic understanding, and schema linking. These techniques and frameworks further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Text-to-SQL by improving schema linking, reducing error propagation, and optimizing the use of pre-trained models.In addition to the traditional LSTM and Transformer models, thePre-trained Models such as BERT, GPT, and T5 have dramatically changed the direction of the Text-to-SQL field. Trained on large-scale text data, these models are able to capture rich semantic representations between natural language and SQL, not only by fine-tuning them to specific tasks but also by
