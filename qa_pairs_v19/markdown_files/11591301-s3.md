## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Negation is typically handled in a bag-of-words model for sentiment analysis by applying certain heuristics to modify the polarity of words affected by negation cues. In the context of lexicon-based sentiment analysis, initial attempts included reversing the polarity of a word or modifying it based on heuristics that determined the scope of negation. This is generally achieved by identifying common negation cues (e.g., "not," "no") and assuming that all words between the negation cue and the next punctuation mark (or until a certain distance) are subject to this negation effect [1] [3].

For instance, Hu and Liu (2004) initiated the approach of reversing polarity while later adaptations also modified the polarity of negated words based on established word lists or sentiment lexicons [1]. The method assumes that the final sentiment of a given text can be understood as a function of the polarities of adjectives, verbs, and nouns present. Therefore, if a positive word is negated, the model would adjust its polarity to negative, thus influencing the overall sentiment score it assigns to the text [1].

In the context of new methodologies being explored, such as the TF-IDF with next word negation model (TF-IDF-NWN), enhancements have been made to traditional bag-of-words frameworks by incorporating mechanisms that better capture the effects of negation. Studies have shown that this approach yields significant improvements in accuracy over standard models by taking into account the way negation affects the polarity of adjacent words [2] [5]. The TF-IDF-NWN model exemplifies a move towards more sophisticated sentiment classification techniques that can effectively represent the nuances introduced by negation.

Overall, in traditional bag-of-words models, the handling of negation involves a focus on modifying the polarity of words based on negation cues and their scopes, aiming to provide a more accurate sentiment assessment by reflecting the true intended sentiment conveyed by the text.

Within the framework of lexicon-based sentiment analysis, researchers first attempted to model negation with simple heuristics, such as reversing \@internalciteHuandLiu2004,Polanyi2006,Kennedy2005 or modifying \@internalciteTaboada2011 the polarity signal of a negated word. This approach to tackle contextual valence shifting generally assumes that the final polarity of a text is some function of the prior polarities of adjectives, verbs, and nouns found in the text. The scope of negation is determined heuristically, by finding common negation cues and assuming all words between the cue and the next punctuation are in scope \@internalciteHuandLiu2004 or based on the distance from the

Our proposed model is then applied on three different text mining algorithms and we found the Linear Support vector machine (LSVM) is the most appropriate to work with our proposed model. The achieved results show significant increase in accuracy compared to earlier methods.

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: state-of-the-art sentiment methods for English. To do so, we train and test three state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers (BERT, ELMo, and a BiLSTM) as well as a bag-of-words classifier on six sentence-level sentiment datasets available for English. We then collect the subset of sentences that all models misclassify and annotate them for 18 linguistic and paralinguistic phenomena, such as negation, sarcasm, modality or world knowledge. We present this new data as a challenging dataset for future research in sentiment analysis, which enables probing the problems that sentiment classifiers still face in more depth.Specifically, the contributions of this work are:•the creation of a challenging sentiment dataset from previously available data,•the annotation of errors in this dataset for 18 linguistic and paralinguistic phenomena,•a thorough analysis of the dataset,•and finally presenting a practical use-case demonstrating how the dataset can beused to
