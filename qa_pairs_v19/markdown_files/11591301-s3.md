## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

In a bag-of-words model for sentiment analysis, negation is typically addressed through heuristics that modify the polarity of words affected by negation cues. The bag-of-words model decomposes text into individual words (tokens) and generally does not consider word order, focusing instead on the occurrence and frequency of words to derive sentiment. This feature presents challenges for accurately capturing the effect of negation, which can radically alter the sentiment of a phrase.

Researchers have developed various strategies to manage negation within this framework. One common approach involves reversing the polarity of the object affected by a negation signal. For instance, if a sentence contains a negative word like "not," the sentiment associated with the word following it can be inverted. This reflects the understanding that negation impacts the entire scope of words influenced by it, generally defined by the distance to the next punctuation mark or other heuristics designed to interact with detected negation cues [2][3][4].

Moreover, studies indicate that while earlier methods utilized simpler heuristics to model negation—like simply reversing the sentiment of negated words—more sophisticated strategies have emerged to better account for contextual valence shifts. This means that the final sentiment derived from a sentence may be considered a function of the prior polarities of all adjectives, verbs, and nouns found within that context. A limitation of simple bag-of-words implementations is that they may fail to account for the context in which words occur, particularly how negations can shift overall sentiment [3][4].

Advanced models, such as those in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), coupled with machine learning techniques, often utilize word embeddings (like Word2Vec and GloVe) or transformer models (like BERT and XLNet) to gain a richer representation of contextual meanings, including the handling of negation. Despite improvements, some studies emphasize that even state-of-the-art models like BERT still struggle with the nuances of negation, reinforcing the need for research that employs holistic methodologies specifically targeting this challenge in sentiment analysis [1][5].

In summary, while traditional bag-of-words models often rely on heuristic rules for negation, NLP advancements are pushing for more comprehensive methods that consider the broader context of negation within text, marking an evolution in how sentiment analysis tasks are approached.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: 2019). The applicability of NLP comes in a variety of forms. In our everyday discourse, such as social media conversations, negation signals are employed. In practice, some NLP techniques used in this space are Word2Vec and GloVe (Yu et al., 2017). BERT and XLNet deliver state-of-the-art outcomes as well (Devlin et al., 2018). However, each model has its own set of constraints. Most algorithms underperform when confronted with negation, which is why it is critical to identify novel approaches to overcome this issue in the NLP domain.2.5. Word Negation and Sequence LabelingThe accuracy of NLP models such as sentiment or perception analysis depends on word negation and sequence labeling. Some NLP models typically work by analyzing each word, or sequence of words, independently. These algorithms deconstruct text into its minimum units called tokens (Webster and Kit, 1992). Once these tokens have been cleaned up, the algorithms read each word or tokenized entity independently and

The most frequent lexicon-based technique for negation is to reverse the polarity of the object that is affected by the negator in a sentence (Jurek et al., 2015). This study presents an alternative approach by developing a disambiguation function that can be used to average out the polarity scores of the negated word antonyms using five dictionaries. Beyond sentiment detection, we propose using antonyms to construct a human-readable semantic construction of the entire sentence, taking a context-based approach into consideration. First, detecting negation in a sentence requires the use of an automated decontraction system, as some negations may be in contraction mode e.g.,

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: The trick here is also that tokens are read at the same time and not in order (either left-to-right or right-to-left). This allows BERT to take the context of each word into account. Similar in its construction, XLNet (Topal et al., 2021) improved its masking mechanism with peculiar assumptions during its pre-training stage, and improved over the work done by BERT. Despite these advances, studies (Ettinger, 2020) have shown that even these approaches have still struggled with negation. Which is why this study aims to examine the problem in a holistic manner.3.
