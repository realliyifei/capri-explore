## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information regarding clustering evaluation metrics, how they account for chance, or the significance of their value ranges. The passages mainly discuss natural language processing, classification approaches, evaluation of language models, and some specific research questions related to NLP but do not cover clustering or its evaluation metrics. Therefore, I cannot answer the question based on the given context.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the laws of thermodynamics?” Following a quality inspection of the synthetically produced questions, we assembled a training dataset of 1601 examples, consisting of 120 questions for each of the 12 topics and 161 general questions. We also derived a test dataset containing 364 examples with a balanced class distribution similar to the training dataset.In our experiments, we evaluated three classification approaches: vector similarity search, prompting a LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), and few-shot fine-tuning of a transformer model with the SetFit framework Tunstall et al. (2022). Concerning the vector search approach with the SPECTER2 model, we measured the cosine similarity to compare vectors of embedded user queries with paper embeddings in our vector database to retrieve the 100 most similar

The answer should be exactly "yes," "maybe," or "no."QNLI: Please identify whether the sentence answers the question. The answer should be exactly "yes" or "no."Evaluation. In processing the responses of LLMs, we first filter the results based on keyword matching. That is, answers that do not contain specified terms (e.g., yes or no) are considered invalid. We only evaluate LLMs’ performance on valid samples. To assess the performance of LLMs, we adopt two metrics: accuracy (i.e., Acc) and attack success rate (ASR). In terms of accuracy, we use benign accuracy (i.e., Acc(ben)) to evaluate LLMs’ performance on original data and adversarial accuracy (i.e., Acc(adv)) to evaluate their accuracy on perturbed data. The formula for ASR can be expressed as ASR=AmBcASRsubscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐵𝑐\text{ASR}=\frac{A_{m}}{B_{c}}, where

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: versus an ability to predict the label via some method of generalisation. In the context of using Language Models for question-answering, discussion continues to occur as to the extent to which questions are answered through memorisation. We consider this issue for questions that would ideally be answered through reasoning over an associated context. We propose a method of identifying evaluation samples for which it is very unlikely our model would have memorised the answers. Our method is based on semantic similarity of input tokens and label tokens between training and evaluation samples. We show that our method offers advantages upon some prior approaches in that it is able to surface evaluation-train pairs that have overlap in either contiguous or discontiguous sequences of tokens. We use this method to identify unmemorisable subsets of our evaluation datasets. We train two Language Models in a multitask fashion whereby the second model differs from the first only in that it has
