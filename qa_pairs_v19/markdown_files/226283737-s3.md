## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not include information about clustering evaluation metrics, their accounting for chance, or their value ranges. The passages focus on aspects related to evaluating Language Models, performance metrics, and methodologies but do not address clustering specifically or how its evaluation is handled in relation to chance. Thus, the context is insufficient to answer the question.

The answer should be exactly "yes," "maybe," or "no."QNLI: Please identify whether the sentence answers the question. The answer should be exactly "yes" or "no."Evaluation. In processing the responses of LLMs, we first filter the results based on keyword matching. That is, answers that do not contain specified terms (e.g., yes or no) are considered invalid. We only evaluate LLMs’ performance on valid samples. To assess the performance of LLMs, we adopt two metrics: accuracy (i.e., Acc) and attack success rate (ASR). In terms of accuracy, we use benign accuracy (i.e., Acc(ben)) to evaluate LLMs’ performance on original data and adversarial accuracy (i.e., Acc(adv)) to evaluate their accuracy on perturbed data. The formula for ASR can be expressed as ASR=AmBcASRsubscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐵𝑐\text{ASR}=\frac{A_{m}}{B_{c}}, where
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: versus an ability to predict the label via some method of generalisation. In the context of using Language Models for question-answering, discussion continues to occur as to the extent to which questions are answered through memorisation. We consider this issue for questions that would ideally be answered through reasoning over an associated context. We propose a method of identifying evaluation samples for which it is very unlikely our model would have memorised the answers. Our method is based on semantic similarity of input tokens and label tokens between training and evaluation samples. We show that our method offers advantages upon some prior approaches in that it is able to surface evaluation-train pairs that have overlap in either contiguous or discontiguous sequences of tokens. We use this method to identify unmemorisable subsets of our evaluation datasets. We train two Language Models in a multitask fashion whereby the second model differs from the first only in that it has

Models such as GPT (Achiam et al., 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), Baichuan (Yang et al., 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), GLM (Du et al., 2022), and DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024) have set new standards, demonstrating exceptional performance across various benchmarks. These models have been widely adopted in both academic and industrial settings, highlighting their versatility and potential. However, the evaluation of LLMs is a multifaceted challenge that extends beyond mere accuracy in answering questions. It involves assessing their ability to understand context, generate coherent and relevant responses, and apply specialized knowledge effectively.Evaluation BenchmarksThe evaluation of LLMs has traditionally relied on established NLP benchmark datasets, such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), which focus
