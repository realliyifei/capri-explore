## Answer

I don't know. The provided context does not contain sufficient information specifically about bilingual lexicons and their application to improve neural machine translation (NMT) models. While the context discusses various aspects of machine translation, such as the evolution from rule-based to statistical methods and the advantages of NMT, it does not detail how bilingual lexicons are utilized in NMT or any techniques involving them. The only mention of lexical information loss within the translation process is in a specific study, but it does not elaborate on the role of bilingual lexicons in enhancing NMT models. Therefore, the context is insufficient to answer the question completely and precisely.

Furthermore, we explored key factors contributing to the model’s performance improvement, including but not limited to the design of the network architecture, optimization of training strategies, and adjustment of hyperparameters. These analyses not only deepen our understanding of the model’s internal working mechanisms but also provide valuable insights and guidance for future research, especially in terms of further enhancing the performance and application scope of machine translation systems.2 PreliminaryMachine translation, as an important branch of the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to achieve automatic conversion from one language to another. Early machine translation methods were primarily based on rules and dictionaries. Since the mid-20th century, machine translation has undergone a transition from rule-based translation to statistical methods Brown et al. (1993); Lopez (2008), and to the current Neural Machine Translation (NMT)

[5]: Passage ID 5: on all languages involved. However, the sentence translation process can lead to the loss of essential lexical information such as inflection and formality, which often served as an indicator of subjectivity (Banea et al., 2008).Chaturvedi et al. (2016b) mitigated this information loss during translation by using a neural network to transfer resources from English to Spanish. They first translated the MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon into Spanish using an SMT system (Lopez, 2008). A MaxEnt-based PoS tagger (Toutanvoa and Manning, 2000) and a multi-lingual WSD system (Moro et al., 2014a) were incorporated in the preprocessing stage to minimize the loss of lexical information during translation. Their proposed model, named Lyapunov Deep Neural Network (LDNN), extracted spatial features from the input Spanish sentence and its translated English form using CNN, which were then combined with an RNN to capture the bilingual temporal features. To mitigate the vanishing gradient problem with RNN,
