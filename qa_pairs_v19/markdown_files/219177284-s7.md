## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

A typical Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) model consists of several key components that work together to process conversation history, retrieve relevant information, and generate appropriate answers to user queries. 

1. **Input Structure**: The CMC model operates on a specific input structure that includes a passage \( P \), a history of question-answer pairs \(\{Q_1, A_1, Q_2, A_2, \ldots, Q_{i-1}, A_{i-1}\}\), and the current question \( Q_i \) [3]. This input is essential for the model to understand the context of the conversation and to predict the answer \( A_i \).

2. **Encoding Module**: One of the major components of a CMC model is the encoding module. This module is responsible for encoding not only the current passage and the answer but also the entire conversational history. This requirement distinguishes CMC from simpler single-turn reading comprehension (MRC) models, which are unable to consider the conversational context [3]. The ability to encode the conversation history is critical for understanding the flow of information and the user's intent.

3. **Document Search Module**: The CMC model is integrated into a larger system often referred to as a Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) system. Within this structure, the document search module retrieves query-relevant documents based on the user’s query. The CMC module, often called the reader, then generates a direct answer based on this retrieved content [1].

4. **Result Generation Module**: After processing the input through the CMC, the model is part of the result generation module, which produces concise and direct answers to queries. This is particularly useful in mobile environments where users prefer quick responses rather than long lists of document links [1].

5. **Multi-Turn Capability**: A significant feature of CMC is its capability to handle multi-turn interactions, allowing users to engage in a dialogue with follow-up questions. The model’s design must accommodate additional complexity to track changes in context and user intent across multiple turns of dialogue, which reflects natural human conversational dynamics [2][4]. This helps bridge the gap between machines and human-like dialogue behavior.

6. **Advancements Leveraged**: Recent advancements in natural language understanding through frameworks like BERT and the introduction of large-scale conversational datasets such as CoQA and QuAC have propelled the research and effectiveness of CMC systems. These developments enable models to achieve near-human performance in understanding and engaging in conversations [2][4].

In conclusion, a typical CMC model is designed to process and understand conversations by incorporating components such as an encoding module that takes into account context and history, a document search module for retrieving relevant information, and methodologies for multi-turn dialogue. The interplay of these components allows for sophisticated interactions that are essential for effective conversational AI [5].

It is a component of the result generation module of a CIR system, as shown in Figure 1.4Equipped with CMC, a CIR system can be used as a conversational open-domain question answering (QA) system.Compared to a (conversational) document search system, a QA system is much easier to use in mobile devices in that they provide concise, direct answers to user queries, as opposed to be a list of document links. To simplify the terminology, a QA

A lot of research in MRC revolves around single-turn QA, but multi-turn CMC also holds major relevance because humans seek information conversationally by asking follow-up questions for additional information based on what they have already learned. Still, the inherent complexity involved in dealing with text comprehension and reasoning over dialogs and context had kept CMC as a far-fetched goal. However, the recent success in achieving at-par-with-human performance on single-turn MRC models [Rajpurkar et al., 2018] due to the advancement in natural language understanding and modeling [Devlin et al., 2019, Lan et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019a], and the introduction of large-scale conversational datasets CoQA [Reddy et al., 2019] and QuAC [Choi et al., 2018] have made information-seeking dialogs possible.As a consequence, CMC has seen a significant surge in research in recent years.
