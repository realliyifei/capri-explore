## Answer

## I don't know?: False

A typical Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) model consists of several key components and serves specific functions to facilitate understanding and engaging in multi-turn dialogues. The primary goal of CMC is to enable systems to comprehend open-domain natural language text while effectively engaging in ongoing conversations with users [4].

1. **Components of a CMC Model**:
   - **Reader Module**: Often referred to simply as the reader, this component generates direct answers to user queries based on relevant documents retrieved by the document search module. It plays a crucial role in the response generation process of a CMC system [1]. 
   
   - **Document Search Module**: Prior to the reader's function, the document search module identifies and retrieves query-relevant documents. This selection process is essential because the quality of the input documents significantly influences the accuracy of the responses generated by the reader [1].
   
   - **Encoding Module**: This module is critical for encoding the input data, which includes the passage of text (P), conversational history expressed in question-answer pairs, and the current question being posed. Encoding the conversational history is vital as it helps maintain context over multi-turn interactions, which is a significant challenge compared to single-turn question answering (QA) [3]. 

2. **Functions of a CMC Model**:
   - **Answer Prediction**: Given a specified passage, conversational history, and an incoming question, the CMC model's primary function is to predict the answer. The answer can take various forms, including a text span from the provided passage or a free-form text response that incorporates evidence from the retrieved materials [3]. 

   - **Multi-Turn Interaction**: CMC systems are designed to manage not just single inquiries but also multi-turn dialogues. This allows users to ask follow-up questions and engage in a more natural conversational flow, resembling human interaction. The model must utilize previous exchanges to provide coherent and context-aware responses [2] [4].

   - **Handling Complexity**: CMC models are tasked with the inherent complexities of understanding text comprehension and reasoning over dialogue and context. This requires sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities, which have improved significantly with advancements in neural models like BERT and the availability of large-scale conversational datasets such as CoQA and QuAC [2]. 

3. **Relevance to Natural Language Processing**: CMC is situated at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine Learning (ML), thus attracting significant research interest. Developing CMC systems is considered one of the ambitious goals of AI, aiming to create intelligent dialog systems that interact with humans naturally and competently across various topics [5].

In summary, a typical CMC model features a reader and document search module, an encoding module for context management, and a focus on both single-turn and multi-turn interactions to effectively answer user questions and engage in conversational exchanges. This complexity highlights the advancements and ongoing research needed to improve such systems in the context of conversational AI.

It is a component of the result generation module of a CIR system, as shown in Figure 1.4Equipped with CMC, a CIR system can be used as a conversational open-domain question answering (QA) system.Compared to a (conversational) document search system, a QA system is much easier to use in mobile devices in that they provide concise, direct answers to user queries, as opposed to be a list of document links. To simplify the terminology, a QA
[2]: Passage ID 2: of the former, the challenge is termed as Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC). A lot of research in MRC revolves around single-turn QA, but multi-turn CMC also holds major relevance because humans seek information conversationally by asking follow-up questions for additional information based on what they have already learned. Still, the inherent complexity involved in dealing with text comprehension and reasoning over dialogs and context had kept CMC as a far-fetched goal. However, the recent success in achieving at-par-with-human performance on single-turn MRC models [Rajpurkar et al., 2018] due to the advancement in natural language understanding and modeling [Devlin et al., 2019, Lan et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019a], and the introduction of large-scale conversational datasets CoQA [Reddy et al., 2019] and QuAC [Choi et al., 2018] have made information-seeking dialogs possible.As a consequence, CMC has seen a significant surge in research in recent years.
