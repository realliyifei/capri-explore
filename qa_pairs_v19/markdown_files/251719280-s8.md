## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Different decoding methods enhance SQL generation in text-to-SQL tasks by leveraging advanced techniques that improve the accuracy and efficiency of translating natural language into SQL queries. These enhancements can be categorized into several key approaches: schema-aware mechanisms, intermediate representations, and task decomposition methods.

1. **Schema-aware Mechanisms**: Recent text-to-SQL models utilize schema information to create more contextually accurate SQL queries. For instance, models like IRNet and RAT-SQL employ relationship-aware attention mechanisms that integrate database schema information into the SQL generation process, allowing the model to leverage the relationships between tables effectively [4]. This integration helps the model understand complex queries that may involve multiple tables and intricate filtering conditions [5].

2. **Intermediate Representations**: Some methods, such as RYANSQL, have introduced intermediate representations in the decoding phase. These representations act as bridges between natural language inputs and SQL syntax. By using sketch-based slot filling, these models can better handle complex queries that require a more nuanced understanding of the user's intent and the database structure [2]. This two-stage approach, which typically involves learning high-quality query representations first, followed by SQL generation, enhances the overall performance of the text-to-SQL task.

3. **Task Decomposition and Reasoning Strategies**: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has brought forth new strategies for SQL generation, particularly through task decomposition techniques. Approaches like QDecomp and C3 break down the SQL generation process into smaller, manageable tasks, allowing the model to reason through the problem gradually. These methods often incorporate Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve the model's generation capabilities by providing it with mechanisms to evaluate multiple candidate SQL statements and select the most appropriate one [4]. This not only enhances the accuracy of the generated SQL queries but also encourages a more systematic approach to handling complex queries.

4. **Graph-Based Techniques**: The introduction of graph-based encoders, as exemplified by the database schema interaction graph, further enhances the decoding process. These encoders utilize historical information about database schema items to make informed predictions about SQL tokens. Such models, as shown in evaluations on benchmark datasets like SParC and CoSQL, demonstrate significant improvements in SQL generation quality by effectively leveraging schema interaction relationships during the prediction process [3].

In conclusion, different decoding methods for text-to-SQL tasks enhance SQL generation through the integration of schema information, use of intermediate representations, application of task decomposition strategies, and implementation of graph-based techniques. These methodologies collectively enable models to produce more accurate and relevant SQL queries that address the complexities of natural language inputs and database structures effectively.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: (NLP) research communities have invested considerable effort in addressing these challenges. Early Text-to-SQL approaches were predominantly based on predefined rules or templates (Baik et al., 2020; Quamar et al., 2022; Sen et al., 2020). These methods conceptualized the conversion task as a straightforward mapping exercise from natural language to SQL. Other techniques approached the problem from a sequence-to-sequence learning perspective, applying encoder-decoder models to capture the translation process (Cai et al., 2017; Popescu et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2022). However, recent advancements have seen the emergence of hybrid methods that synergize the strengths of both database and NLP technologies. These include approaches that consider schema relations (Hui et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a; Qi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2019, 2022b; Zheng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023d) and others that incorporate syntax parsing techniques (Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023b; Scholak et al., 2021;
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), a sketch of the evolutionary process is shown in Fig. 2.II-B1 Rule-based MethodsEarly text-to-SQL systems relied heavily on rule-based methods [11, 12, 26], where manually crafted rules and heuristics were used to map natural language questions to SQL queries.These approaches often involved extensive feature engineering and domain-specific knowledge.While rule-based methods achieved success in specific simple domains, they lacked the flexibility and generalization capabilities needed to handle diverse and complex questions.II-B2 Deep Learning-based ApproachesWith the rise of deep neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models and encoder-decoder structures, such as LSTMs [78] and transformers [17], were adapted to generate SQL queries from natural language input [79, 19].Typically, RYANSQL [19] introduced techniques like intermediate representations and sketch-based slot filling to handle complex questions and improve cross-domain
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: propose a database schema interaction graph encoder to utilize historicalal information of database schema items. In decoding phase, we introduce a gate mechanism to weigh the importance of different vocabularies and then make the prediction of SQL tokens. We evaluate our model on the benchmark SParC and CoSQL datasets, which are two large complex context-dependent cross-domain text-to-SQL datasets. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the two datasets. The comparison and ablation results demonstrate the efficacy of our model and the usefulness of the database schema interaction graph encoder.1 IntroductionThe Text-to-SQL task aims to translate natural language texts into SQL queries. Users who do not understand SQL grammars can benefit from this task and acquire information from databases by just inputting natural language texts. Previous works Li and Jagadish (2014); Xu et al. (2017); Yu et al.
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: the widespread application of Transformer models, especially models based on sequence-to-sequence architecture [14, 15], text-to-SQL research makes significant progress. For example, IRNet [16] and RAT-SQL [1] adopt a relationship-aware attention mechanism to tightly integrate database schema information with the SQL generation process. After LLM is widely proven to be powerful in NLP tasks, more and more research explores its potential in Text-to-SQL tasks. Methods such as QDecomp [17], C3 [18], QDMR [19], and DIN-SQL [8] introduce task decomposition and reasoning strategies, such as Chain of Thought (CoT) [20], to gradually improve SQL generation performance. In the SQL generation process, the method of using LLM to generate multiple candidate SQL statements and select the best candidate has been proven to be effective [21, 22, 23]. For example, multiple candidate SQLs can be generated through different prompts, and then the optimal solution can be selected [24]. This strategy can
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: even simple user queries may involve complex combinations of multiple tables and filtering requirements, necessitating sophisticated context understanding techniques to fulfill query needs. Secondly, there remains a significant gap between existing Text-to-SQL methods and real-world applications in efficiently and effectively generating high-quality SQLs, especially when dealing with large-scale databases.Deep learning technologies have greatly advanced Text-to-SQLs methods through developing both non-seq2seq methods and seq2seq methods classified in terms of model architectures [2, 1]. For non-seq2seq methods [5, 6, 7], they typically involve two stages: 1) it employ encoder models with attention mechanisms like BERT [8] to learn high-quality representations of user queries; 2) it constructs sketch-based or grammar-based systems to generate SQL statements. On the other hand, seq2seq methods [9, 10, 11] treat Text-to-SQLs as a machine translation task, directly translating user
