## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Different decoding methods enhance SQL generation in text-to-SQL tasks by leveraging advanced strategies from both sequence-to-sequence learning and transformer models, as well as hybrid techniques that integrate various computational approaches. 

Initially, traditional methods relied on predefined rules or templates for converting natural language to SQL, conceptualizing the translation as a simple mapping task [1]. However, contemporary approaches have shifted towards more sophisticated models such as the use of encoder-decoder architectures that facilitate a more nuanced translation process [1][2]. For instance, models like IRNet and RAT-SQL incorporate a relationship-aware attention mechanism, which effectively integrates database schema information into the SQL generation process. This integration improves the model's ability to understand contextual relationships within the data, thereby enhancing accuracy [3].

One key method is task decomposition, where complex SQL generation tasks are divided into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Techniques such as those employed in QDecomp, C3, and DIN-SQL utilize reasoning strategies like Chain of Thought (CoT), progressively building a SQL statement through logical steps. This method not only facilitates clearer understanding but also outputs multiple candidate SQLs from which the best can be selected, optimizing the final query generated [3][4].

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized text-to-SQL tasks due to their powerful comprehension and generative capabilities. Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical technique, involving the provision of specific prompts that detail the database structure, user queries, and examples. This comprehensive input significantly influences the quality of the SQL generated; for instance, detailed descriptions of database features—such as annotations and relational mappings—result in better performance [5]. The iterative nature of generating multiple candidates and selecting the optimal one allows exploration of various output possibilities, improving the robustness of the generated SQL statements [3].

Furthermore, advancements in deep learning have led to both non-seq2seq and seq2seq methods being employed in text-to-SQL models. Non-seq2seq methods often use encoder architectures, such as BERT, to create high-quality representations of input queries, while seq2seq methods treat the task similarly to machine translation, directly converting user queries into SQL statements [4]. This variety in decoding strategies provides nuanced approaches that can better handle the complexity of real-world database queries.

Additionally, the integration of schema relations in decoding strategies aids the model in understanding how different data points relate to one another, which is crucial when user queries involve multiple tables and complex filtering conditions [1][4]. As such, the combination of advanced encoding techniques, decomposition strategies, and the capabilities of LLMs significantly enhances the SQL generation process in text-to-SQL tasks. Overall, these decoding methods collectively offer a more robust, efficient, and scalable framework for generating high-quality SQL queries tailored to diverse database environments.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: (NLP) research communities have invested considerable effort in addressing these challenges. Early Text-to-SQL approaches were predominantly based on predefined rules or templates (Baik et al., 2020; Quamar et al., 2022; Sen et al., 2020). These methods conceptualized the conversion task as a straightforward mapping exercise from natural language to SQL. Other techniques approached the problem from a sequence-to-sequence learning perspective, applying encoder-decoder models to capture the translation process (Cai et al., 2017; Popescu et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2022). However, recent advancements have seen the emergence of hybrid methods that synergize the strengths of both database and NLP technologies. These include approaches that consider schema relations (Hui et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a; Qi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2019, 2022b; Zheng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023d) and others that incorporate syntax parsing techniques (Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023b; Scholak et al., 2021;
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: SQL unless a human expert provides the necessary knowledge to the LLMs Li et al. (2023b). Given this challenge, it is valuable to develop a non-human architecture that can automatically generate the required data expert knowledge for SQL generation. This would significantly enhance the performance and robustness of text-to-SQL models.Figure 1: A sketch map illustrating the significance of incorporating expert knowledge in Text-to-SQL task.Existing models primarily focus on fully exploring the comprehensibility of Language Model. As the forerunner, T5-based methods Scholak et al. (2021); Li et al. (2023a); Rai et al. (2023) made an initial attempt to train a language model from scratch to generate SQL based on user queries and database schemas. Following the popularity of Language Models, particularly ChatGPT and GPT4 OpenAI (2023), DIN-SQL Pourreza and Rafiei (2023) utilizes GPT to decompose the process of SQL generation into several sub-tasks. It uses GPT to first accomplish
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: the widespread application of Transformer models, especially models based on sequence-to-sequence architecture [14, 15], text-to-SQL research makes significant progress. For example, IRNet [16] and RAT-SQL [1] adopt a relationship-aware attention mechanism to tightly integrate database schema information with the SQL generation process. After LLM is widely proven to be powerful in NLP tasks, more and more research explores its potential in Text-to-SQL tasks. Methods such as QDecomp [17], C3 [18], QDMR [19], and DIN-SQL [8] introduce task decomposition and reasoning strategies, such as Chain of Thought (CoT) [20], to gradually improve SQL generation performance. In the SQL generation process, the method of using LLM to generate multiple candidate SQL statements and select the best candidate has been proven to be effective [21, 22, 23]. For example, multiple candidate SQLs can be generated through different prompts, and then the optimal solution can be selected [24]. This strategy can
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: even simple user queries may involve complex combinations of multiple tables and filtering requirements, necessitating sophisticated context understanding techniques to fulfill query needs. Secondly, there remains a significant gap between existing Text-to-SQL methods and real-world applications in efficiently and effectively generating high-quality SQLs, especially when dealing with large-scale databases.Deep learning technologies have greatly advanced Text-to-SQLs methods through developing both non-seq2seq methods and seq2seq methods classified in terms of model architectures [2, 1]. For non-seq2seq methods [5, 6, 7], they typically involve two stages: 1) it employ encoder models with attention mechanisms like BERT [8] to learn high-quality representations of user queries; 2) it constructs sketch-based or grammar-based systems to generate SQL statements. On the other hand, seq2seq methods [9, 10, 11] treat Text-to-SQLs as a machine translation task, directly translating user
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: powerful comprehension and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) [4, 5, 6] for Text-to-SQL tasks has become a primary approach for boosting performance, and prompt engineering has emerged as the mainstream technical strategy. A typical prompt provided to the LLM for Text-to-SQL usually includes a description of the database, user queries, and few-shot demonstrations [7, 8], which allows the system to be applicable to various databases. Intuitively, assuming the LLM possesses sufficiently strong capabilities, the more precise and detailed the database description, the better the quality of the generated SQL queries. Features such as the database’s structure, annotations, sample data, and relational mappings have been shown to improve Text-to-SQL performance in specific scenarios [9, 10].Fine-grained descriptions of databases present challenges. It is common for databases, especially large-scale industrial databases, to have hundreds or thousands of fields.
