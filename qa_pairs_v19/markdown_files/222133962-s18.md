## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information related to the incorporation of lexical information into unsupervised dependency parsing, nor does it address challenges or potential solutions specific to that area. The passages discuss general aspects of natural language processing, question answering systems, evaluation benchmarks, and techniques like information extraction, but they do not cover unsupervised dependency parsing or the lexical information related to it. Therefore, the context is insufficient to accurately answer your question.

The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their

These initial evaluations primarily concentrate on aspects such as grammar and vocabulary, encompassing tasks like syntactic parsing, word sense disambiguation, and so on.In the early 1990s, the advent of the MUC evaluation (Grishman & Sundheim, 1996) has marked a significant milestone in the NLP community.The MUC evaluation primarily centers on information extraction tasks, challenging participants to extract specific information from text. This evaluation framework plays a pivotal role in propelling the field of information extraction forward. Subsequently, with the emergence of deep learning in the 2010s, the NLP community embraces more expansive benchmarks like SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). These benchmarks not only evaluate system performance but also provide

Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Information Extraction (IE) refers to the use of computational methods to identify relevant pieces of information in document generated for human use and convert this information into a representation suitable for computer based storage, processing, and retrieval (Wimalasuriya and Dua, 2010). The input to IE system is a collection of documents (email, web pages, news groups, news articles, business reports, research papers, blogs, resumes,
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: data lacks a predefined format, posing significant challenges for traditional data processing methodologies. Consequently, organizations must employ advanced text understanding and information extraction techniques to analyze and extract meaningful insights from this data effectively.Text understanding and information extraction are key tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automatically processing data from unstructured text documents.The rise of Transformer architectures and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) opens new perspectives for extracting and structuring information from vast amounts of natural language texts [5].One main aspect deals with Knowledge graphs (KGs) construction. KGs structure representations of knowledge by capturing relationships between entities and hold considerable advantages in analyzing text data collections and inferring knowledge from structured heterogeneous data. For instance, KGs can merge diverse data from multiple sources,
