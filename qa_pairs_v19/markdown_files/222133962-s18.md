## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not contain specific information about the challenges associated with incorporating lexical information into unsupervised dependency parsing or the potential solutions to these challenges. The passages focus primarily on general advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), the emergence of new tasks within Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG), and the developments surrounding large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, without delving into details on dependency parsing or lexical information integration.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: LLMs (as machine translation, text classification, and text generation). The progress has been so great that some of these tasks can now be considered solved. The question arises as to how this will impact NLP and NLG going forward and how will their role shift in the face of recent advances in LLMs. Languages are, however, more complex and ultimately LLMs are only specific models based mainly on contextual relationships between words. Indeed, new tasks or new NLU and NLG research lines are emerging, and others remain unsolved. Papers as [2] indicate some of the unsolved topics, such as syntactic parsing with Universal Dependencies, semantic compositionality or causality relationships.The overall goal of this survey is to provide an analysis of several NLG survey papers published recently, exploring the emerging and unsolved research topics in NLG. Our work is presented as a NLG roadmap, detecting the areas requiring improvement and looking beyond the recent successes of

The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: Bard and more specifically, tools such as ChatGPT have become a benchmark for other LLMs when solving most of the tasks involved in NLG research. This scenario poses new questions about the next steps for NLG and how the field can adapt and evolve to deal with new challenges in the era of LLMs.To address this, the present paper conducts a review of a representative sample of surveys recently published in NLG. By doing so, we aim to provide the scientific community with a research roadmap to identify which NLG aspects are still not suitably addressed by LLMs, as well as suggest future lines of research that should be addressed going forward.1 IntroductionNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a key component of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the sense that it enables humans and machines to interact more naturally. Despite NLP’s recent popularity, research in this area spans more than 60 years. The complexity involved in the understanding —Natural Language Understanding (NLU)— and
