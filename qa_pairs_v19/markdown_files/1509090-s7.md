## Answer

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information on MWE (Multi-Word Expressions) discovery or identification methods. There are no relevant passages that define MWE discovery or discuss related techniques, making it impossible to provide a precise answer to your question.

[1]: Passage ID 1: more recent attempts with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. However, in spite of the progress, our recent survey shows that there is still a lack of systematic understanding and organization of commonly used NLP techniques in RE.We believe one hurdle facing the industry is lack of shared knowledge of NLP techniques and their usage in RE tasks. In this paper, we present our effort to synthesize and organize 57 most frequently used NLP techniques in RE. We classify these NLP techniques in two ways: first, by their NLP tasks in typical pipelines and second, by their linguist analysis levels. We believe these two ways of classification are complementary, contributing to a better understanding of the NLP techniques in RE and such understanding is crucial to the development of better NLP tools for RE.Index Terms: Requirements Engineering (RE), Natural Language Processing (NLP), NLP Tasks, NLP TechniquesI IntroductionResearch in developing natural language
[2]: Passage ID 2: language processing (NLP). Understanding such complex text data is imperative, given that it is rich in information and can be used widely across various applications. In this survey, we explore different word representation models and its power of expression, from the classical to modern-day state-of-the-art word representation language models (LMS). We describe a variety of text representation methods, and model designs have blossomed in the context of NLP, including SOTA LMs. These models can transform large volumes of text into effective vector representations capturing the same semantic information. Further, such representations can be utilized by various machine learning (ML) algorithms for a variety of NLP related tasks. In the end, this survey briefly discusses the commonly used ML and DL based classifiers, evaluation metrics and the applications of these word embeddings in different NLP tasks.Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Word representation, Language

[4]: Passage ID 4: of the ML-based approaches over the traditional, rule-based NLP approaches are effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert manpower, and straightforward portability to different domains [34].In RE, the earliest adoption of ML to NLP can be traced to a study by Cleland-Huang et al. [35], published in 2007, in which the authors presented an approach for automatically detecting and classifying non-functional requirements (NFRs) from requirements documents. The approach uses a set of weighted indicator terms to classify requirements; a probability value of each indicator term is computed by a probability function similar to Naïve Bayes [36], to estimate the likelihood of an input requirement being classified into a certain NFR category. The development of this approach thus marked the beginning of the work on ML-based approaches for RE and, as a seminal work in this area, this approach has been frequently used as the baseline to assess the performance of new techniques [37,
[5]: Passage ID 5: adjective, adverb and so on (Part of Speech Tagging). At the semantic level, each word is analyzed to get the meaningful representation of the sentence. Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Information Extraction (IE) refers to the use of computational methods to identify relevant pieces of information in document generated for human use and convert this information into a representation suitable for computer based storage, processing, and retrieval (Wimalasuriya and Dua, 2010). The input to IE system is a collection of documents (email, web pages, news groups, news articles, business reports, research papers, blogs, resumes,
