## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any specific information regarding statistical pattern recognition in automatic speech recognition (ASR) or its essential components. The passages mainly discuss natural language processing (NLP), focusing on tasks such as question answering, and provide an overview of natural language understanding and generation. There are no details or references to speech recognition methodologies, statistical pattern recognition techniques, or their components within the context given.

The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence.

Our research is a valuable guide and reference for artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners interested in natural language processing applications such as recommender systems, chatbots, and sentiment analysis.Index Terms: Artificial neural networks, genealogy, natural language processing, survey, taxonomy, text representation\titlepgskip=-15ptI IntroductionComputational understanding of natural language is referred to as a particularly hard problem of science [1] and sometimes it is even described as being “simply too hard” [2]. Nonetheless, the research field of natural language processing (NLP) takes on this challenge to enable machines to fully understand human text and speech [3]. The principal obstacle for a machine in NLP is the symbolic nature of text. Although a machine can process it, the meaning of language goes beyond what is represented [4]. To access the underlying information, traditional approaches compile texts

In recent years, deep neural network-based approaches to realizing different forms of data-driven representation learning have gained widespread interest due to their competitiveness and flexibility. Question Answering (QA) is widely considered one of the most important tasks of NLP, as it enables humans to interact with machines in a more natural way by either extracting information related to questions from different knowledge sources or by generating the answer without the need for using structural query languages. In other words, QA tries to retrieve or generate answers in the form of a natural language based on a given input, instead of, providing a ranked list of documents as provided by search engines or classic information retrieval systems which require additional steps for checking each document to find useful content 12.Since the 1960s many question-answering systems have been
