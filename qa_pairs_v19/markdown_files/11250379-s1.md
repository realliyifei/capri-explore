## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information regarding the utilization of statistical pattern recognition in automatic speech recognition or its essential components. The passages primarily focus on natural language processing in general, including question answering, natural language understanding, and natural language generation, but there are no details on statistical methods, automatic speech recognition techniques, or their components that are relevant to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with text understanding and text generation. The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: explain the state-of-the-art. Our research is a valuable guide and reference for artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners interested in natural language processing applications such as recommender systems, chatbots, and sentiment analysis.Index Terms: Artificial neural networks, genealogy, natural language processing, survey, taxonomy, text representation\titlepgskip=-15ptI IntroductionComputational understanding of natural language is referred to as a particularly hard problem of science [1] and sometimes it is even described as being “simply too hard” [2]. Nonetheless, the research field of natural language processing (NLP) takes on this challenge to enable machines to fully understand human text and speech [3]. The principal obstacle for a machine in NLP is the symbolic nature of text. Although a machine can process it, the meaning of language goes beyond what is represented [4]. To access the underlying information, traditional approaches compile texts
