## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

Methods inspired by word sense disambiguation (WSD) address the identification and classification of multiword expressions (MWEs) by integrating WSD techniques with MWE detection processes. This integrated approach acknowledges that MWEs can carry multiple possible meanings, which complicates their identification and classification.

A foundational aspect of this process is the understanding that MWEs, such as "break up," can possess different interpretations depending on the context. For instance, "break up" might refer to the physical separation of objects or the ending of romantic relationships, showcasing that even when MWEs are correctly identified, their meanings require additional contextual understanding through WSD [1][5]. Thus, the simultaneous handling of MWE identification and WSD is crucial to improving clarity and accuracy in applications like machine translation and information extraction [5].

Identification of MWEs primarily involves locating these phrases within text, which can be challenging due to their non-compositional nature ‚Äî their meanings are not strictly derived from the individual meanings of their components [3]. This difficulty is further amplified for verbal MWEs, where components may be variably conjugated or separated across clauses [4]. To tackle this issue, systems have been developed that utilize MWE lexicons and rule-based methods, thereby enabling robust detection of MWEs [4]. These methodologies help create a structured environment where both the identification of MWEs and their corresponding senses can be executed more effectively.

The integration of WSD into the MWE identification process serves as a means of disambiguating meanings based on context, thus enabling a more nuanced treatment of language. For example, employing a model that scores similarities based on word embeddings can help predict the most likely senses for detected MWEs [2], ensuring that the application not only identifies the MWEs present but also understands their intended meanings within varying contexts.

Moreover, research has been conducted that specifically combines the tasks of WSD and MWE identification to facilitate better preprocessing for downstream NLP applications [5]. The interrelated nature of these tasks underscores the importance of developing cohesive strategies that enhance both MWE detection and meaning resolution.

In summary, WSD methodologies bolster MWE transcription by providing mechanisms to resolve ambiguities associated with their meanings. The combination of identifying MWEs in text and clarifying their semantic senses thus enhances natural language processing applications, which relies on accurately understanding and processing language nuances [5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: be done before one can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWEs successfully [12].The study of multiword expressions in NLP has been gaining prominence, and in recent years the number of researchers and projects focusing on them has increased dramatically. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for NLP, including MT and Translation Technology. The inability to detect MWEs automatically may result in incorrect (and even unfortunate) automatic translations and may jeopardise the performance of applications such as text summarisation and web search.Multiword expressions do not only play a crucial role in the computational treatment of natural languages. Often terms are multiword expressions (and not single words), making them highly relevant to terminology. The requirement for correct rendering of MWEs in translation and interpretation highlights their importance in these fields. Given the pervasive nature of MWEs, they play a crucial

[2]:  Passage ID 2: multiword expression (MWE) identification and classification in the multilingual PARSEME shared tasks (Savary et¬†al., 2017; Ramisch et¬†al., 2018, 2020).By analogy with named entity recognition, we can use the term lexical semantic recognition (LSR) for such chunking-and-labeling tasks that apply to lexical meaning generally, not just entities.This disambiguation can serve as a foundational layer of analysis for downstream applications in natural language processing, and provides an initial level of organization for compiling lexical resources, such as semantic nets and thesauri.In this paper, we tackle a more inclusive LSR task of lexical semantic segmentation and disambiguation.The STREUSLE corpus (see Section¬†2) contains comprehensive annotations of MWEs (along with their holistic syntactic status) and noun, verb, and preposition/possessive supersenses.We train a neural CRF tagger Lafferty et¬†al. (2001) using BERT embeddings Devlin et¬†al. (2019) and find that it obtains strong

(2015), but they can be broadly defined as groupings of words whose meaning is not entirely composed of the meanings of included words (Sag et¬†al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2010). This includes idioms such as a taste of one‚Äôs own medicine, verb-particle constructions such as break up or run down, compound nouns such as bus stop, and any other grouping of words with non-compositional semantics. In fact, a significant portion of noun MWEs are named entities (Savary et¬†al., 2019).The task of MWE identification is locating these MWEs in a given body of text. Common approaches to solving MWE identification include rule-based systems (Foufi et¬†al., 2017; Pasquer et¬†al.,
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: 2019).The task of MWE identification is locating these MWEs in a given body of text. Common approaches to solving MWE identification include rule-based systems (Foufi et¬†al., 2017; Pasquer et¬†al., 2020), CRF-based systems Liu et¬†al. (2021), and token tagging systems (Rohanian et¬†al., 2019). Rule-based systems remain competitive with neural models in this task, and many systems including ours use MWE lexicons in order to identify MWEs, which Savary et¬†al. (2019) argue are critical to making progress in MWE identification. Kurfalƒ± and √ñstling (2020) and Kanclerz and Piasecki (2022) are similar to our work in that they frame the task of MWE identification as a classification problem, although neither use gloss information.Among all the types of MWEs, verbal MWEs are particularly difficult to identify due to their surface variability ‚Äî constituents can be conjugated or separated so that they become discontinuous (Pasquer et¬†al., 2020). Much work on verbal MWE identification,
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: mark all combinations of words in known MWEs as MWEs. MWEs can also have multiple possible senses in the same way words can: break up can refer both to objects physically breaking apart and romantic relationships ending, so even in cases where it is correctly identified as a MWE its meaning is ambiguous without WSD. Identifying the meanings of all words in a sentence requires solving these tasks together.WSD and MWE identification can be used in preprocessing to improve performance of downstream tasks such as machine translation or information extraction Zaninello and Birch (2020); Song et¬†al. (2021); Barba et¬†al. (2021a). They also have more direct applications in helping language learners ‚Äì for whom MWEs are particularly challenging Christiansen and Arnon (2017); Pulido (2022) ‚Äì understand the meaning of words or MWEs in context.In this paper, we propose a system that tackles these tasks together, using a MWE lexicon and rule-based pipeline to identify MWE candidates and a
