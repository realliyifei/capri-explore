## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information regarding the relationship between methods inspired by word sense disambiguation and the identification and classification of multiword expressions (MWEs). Although the passages mention the significance of MWEs in natural language processing and discuss approaches to identifying them, they do not address the specific mechanisms or methodologies related to word sense disambiguation in this context. Thus, the context is insufficient to provide a complete answer to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: (MT) [17, 16], which depends on a clear distinction between word tokens and phrases, has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs [8, 29]. The usual approach in these applications is to identify MWEs first, and then treat them accordingly. Therefore, detecting MWEs is a key research area in NLP.In recent years, the identification of MWEs has been modelled as a supervised machine learning task where the machine learning models are trained on an annotated dataset. As we explain in Section 2, several datasets have been released to train these machine learning models. Furthermore shared tasks such as SemEval-2016 Task 10 [28] and PARSEME [27] have contributed to develop datasets. In recent years, neural network-based models, and in particular architectures incorporating RecurrentNeural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in MWE identification tasks [27]. Usually, these models utilise

Each Subtask includes different settings regarding the amount of training data. Besides the task description, this paper introduces the datasets in English, Portuguese, and Galician and their annotation procedure, the evaluation metrics, and a summary of the participant systems and their results. The task had close to 100 registered participants organised into twenty five teams making over 650 and 150 submissions in the practice and evaluation phases respectively.1 IntroductionMultiword Expressions (MWEs) are a challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as their linguistic behaviour (e.g., syntactic, semantic) differs from that of generic word combinations Baldwin and Kim (2010); Ramisch and Villavicencio (2018).

The task of processing MWEs is crucial in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, including machine translation and terminology extraction. Therefore, detecting MWEs is a popular research theme. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art neural transformers in the task of detecting MWEs. We empirically evaluate several transformer models in the dataset for SemEval-2016 Task 10: Detecting Minimal Semantic Units and their Meanings (DiMSUM). We show that transformer models outperform the previous neural models
