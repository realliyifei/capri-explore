## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know, as the provided context does not specifically discuss the topic of synonym replacement in token-level augmentation or how language models address challenges related to this particular process. While passages reference general advancements in language models, their applications, and the challenges of data scarcity, none detail the mechanisms or techniques involved in synonym replacement or augmentative methods. This lack of specific information hinders the ability to provide a comprehensive answer.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: syntax, grammar, decision making, and reasoning from insufficient amounts of task-specific dataset. The recently introduced pre-trained language models have the potential to address the issue of data scarcity and bring considerable advantages by generating contextualized word embeddings. These models are considered counterpart of ImageNet in NLP and have demonstrated to capture different facets of language such as hierarchical relations, long-term dependency, and sentiment. In this short survey paper, we discuss the recent progress made in the field of pre-trained language models. We also deliberate that how the strengths of these language models can be leveraged in designing more engaging and more eloquent conversational agents. This paper, therefore, intends to establish whether these pre-trained models can overcome the challenges pertinent to dialogue systems, and how their architecture could be exploited in order to overcome these challenges. Open challenges in the field of
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: Language Models. To our surprise, we find that prompting-based approaches outperform controllable text generation methods on most datasets and tasks, highlighting a need for research on controllable text generation with Instruction-tuned Language Models in specific. Prompt-based approaches match human performance on most stylistic tasks while lagging on structural tasks, foregrounding a need to study more varied constraints and more challenging stylistic tasks. To facilitate such research, we provide an algorithm that uses only a task dataset and a Large Language Model with in-context capabilities to automatically generate a constraint dataset. This method eliminates the fields dependence on pre-curated constraint datasets, hence vastly expanding the range of constraints that can be studied in the future.1 IntroductionRecent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Jones, 1994; Chowdhary & Chowdhary, 2020) have highlighted emergent capabilities of Large Language Models
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: seem a solution because they incorporate existing financial knowledge into textual analysis. However, they are based on ”word counting” methods, which come short in analyzing deeper semantic meaning of a given text.NLP transfer learning methods look like a promising solution to both of the challenges mentioned above, and are the focus of this thesis. The core idea behind these models is that by training language models on very large corpora and then initializing down-stream models with the weights learned from the language modeling task, a much better performance can be achieved. The initialized layers can range from the single word embedding layer (Peters et al., 2018) to the whole model (Howard and Ruder, 2018). This approach should, in theory, be an answer to the scarcity of labeled data problem. Language models don’t require any labels, since the task is predicting the next word. They can learn how to represent the semantic information. That leaves the fine-tuning on labeled
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: limitations such as rare word handling, overfitting, and capturing complex linguistic patterns. Notable examples, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 [2], leverage the self-attention mechanism within Transformer architectures to efficiently manage sequential data and understand long-range dependencies. Key advancements include in-context learning for generating coherent text from prompts and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [3] for refining models using human responses. Techniques like prompt engineering, question-answering, and conversational interactions have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) [4].1.2 Historical Development and Key MilestonesLanguage models are fundamental to natural language processing (NLP), leveraging mathematical techniques to generalise linguistic rules and knowledge for tasks involving prediction and generation. Over several decades, language modelling has evolved from early statistical language models (SLMs) to
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: need to be addressed.2. Pre-trained Language ModelingMost datasets available for NLP tasks are rather small. This data scarcity problem makes it difficult to train the deep neural networks, as they would result in an over-fitted model and not generalize well on these small datasets. The concept of pre-training a model on ImageNet corpus has been employed for quite a few years in the field of computer vision (Palatucci et al., 2009; Larochelleet al., 2008). The idea is to make the model learn the general features of an image and this learning can then be utilized in any vision task such as image captioning etc. to achieve the state-of-the-art results.Pre-trained language modeling can be considered an equivalent of ImageNet in NLP and has achieved state-of-the-art results on various downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, data classification, and question answering, etc. The timeline of pre-trained language models can be divided into two
