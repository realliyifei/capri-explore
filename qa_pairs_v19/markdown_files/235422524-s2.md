## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Language models address the challenges of synonym replacement in token-level augmentation primarily through their ability to generate contextually appropriate substitutions. Traditional synonym replacement techniques often lead to decreased model performance, as they may substitute words with synonyms that do not fit the context adequately, ultimately resulting in label distortion [4]. In contrast, advanced language models can filter out contextually unfitting synonyms by utilizing output probabilities to ensure that the replacements align better with the intended meaning of the original text [5].

Additionally, language models such as BERT and other transformer-based architectures can employ more sophisticated techniques, such as Mask Filling, where words are randomly replaced with a masked token, and the model predicts the appropriate replacement based on contextual understanding [3]. This not only diversifies the set of augmented data but also enhances the quality of the generated text by adhering to the larger semantic structure of the sentences, thus making the augmentation process more effective.

Moreover, language models can be trained in a label-conditioned manner, which involves training specifically designed models that consider the labels of the data during the augmentation process. This approach reduces the risk of label distortion that can occur when using general synonym replacement techniques, as it ensures that replacements maintain the integrity of the label associated with the data [5]. Although training these models from scratch can be resource-intensive, leveraging existing models in combination with reinforcement learning techniques or other selective filters has been proposed as a more viable strategy for managing low-resource regimes where labeled data is scarce [5].

In summary, language models overcome the challenges associated with synonym replacement through (1) context-based filtering of synonym candidates to ensure semantic coherence [5], (2) the use of advanced techniques like Mask Filling that capitalize on the model’s understanding of the context [3], and (3) the development of label-conditioned models to prevent label distortion while augmenting the data [5]. These methods collectively enhance the effectiveness and reliability of text augmentation in NLP tasks.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: sites, and academic papers. NLP uses this data for tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, question answering, and chatbots. As industries like finance, healthcare, and marketing begin to use NLP more and more, it’s important that we overcome the challenges of dealing with text data.One of the most significant challenges is sparsity, which occurs when words or phrases appear only once or twice in the corpus. Another significant challenge is the lack of labeled data. This can limit the performance of supervised learning algorithms, which are essential for data analysis. Deep learning models are becoming more and more successful as the amount of data increases. However, the performance of the models can be limited by the cost of obtaining labeled data.This research addresses these challenges by pioneering a method of text augmentation that prioritizes the strategic sequencing and integration of augmented sentences within the training process, with the goal of
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: while pre-training [16]. Therefore, using data augmentation to add rarely occurring words and synonyms does not tend to improve model performance [16]. Longpre et al. [17] demonstrate that some data augmentation methods cannot achieve gains when using large pre-trained language models as they are already invariant to various transformations, such as synonym replacement. The authors also state that large language models map data to a latent space with representations nearly invariant to some transformations. As some of the traditional data augmentation methods do not work for neural models, it makes sense to investigate data augmentation for neural NLP specifically.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II explains the challenges of label preservation in data augmentation. Section III provides an overview of data augmentation methods with a focus on strategies suitable for deep learning models. Section IV addresses the practical challenges of applying data
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: synonym replacement technique, word embedding-based augmentation provides a more diverse set of augmented data. Moreover, for models like BERT, the use of Mask Filling language models allows for the random replacement of words with a Mask, which is then filled with model predictions. Overall, the use of word embedding techniques in text augmentation is an effective strategy to enhance the quality and quantity of training data.Recent advances in NLP have led to the development of powerful models, such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) Radford et al. (2019), that can generate coherent, semantically meaningful text. The ability of these transformer-based models to generate entirely new sentences and paragraphs from an existing dataset has opened up new possibilities for text augmentation. Researchers can generate a much larger and more diverse set of synthetic data to train their models by feeding the original text data into the transformer models. In this context,
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: hand, token-level transformations were less consistent. Synonym replacement usually lowered the performance of the model. Random word deletion and random word swap were only used on a part-of-speech tagging task, but showed positive gain on model results.Structure-based transformations, such as cropping and rotation, were most inconsistent in improving models’ results.Another approach to tackle low-resource regimes is to use semi-supervised and unsupervised methods discussed in Section III-A.IV-G Lack of benchmarksAutomated learning of data augmentation policy for NLP is in its early stages [12]. While there is progress in automatic data augmentation without hand-picking initial transformations in computer vision [72], most of the automated methods in NLP rely on practitioners to choose augmentation methods based on their prior knowledge of the task. When choosing augmentation methods, practitioners face a challenge as it is difficult to compare different research papers
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: language and again when translating back to the source language. This is especially problematic for low-resource languages with poorly performing translation models [4].Language models can be used in different scenarios. One option is to use them to filter contextually unfitting synonym words based on language model output probabilities. Another possibility is to use them as the main augmentation method, where they not only substitute words with similar meaning but with words that fit the context. However, using language models for generating replacement words increases the risk for label distortion [7]. The risk can be mitigated by using label conditional language models [22].Some authors train label-conditioned language models from scratch, but that can be expensive and not realistic for low-data regimes. Others have proposed to reuse existing language models and combine them with reinforcement learning agent or discriminator to either condition the language model or filter out
