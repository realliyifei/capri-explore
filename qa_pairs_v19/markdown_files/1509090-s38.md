## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Machine translation (MT) systems face several primary challenges when translating multi-word expressions (MWEs). These challenges stem from the unique characteristics of MWEs and their critical role in accurate translation.

1. **Recognition and Detection of MWEs**: One of the main challenges is the accurate recognition and detection of MWEs within the source text. MWEs do not behave like single words; they often consist of fixed phrases that carry meanings that are not immediately apparent from the individual words. The ability to automatically detect MWEs is essential for producing accurate translations. Failure to do so can lead to incorrect translations, potentially distorting the intended meaning of the text [1] [2].

2. **Translation Accuracy and Meaning Equivalence**: Even when MWEs are detected, translating them accurately poses a significant problem. MT systems must ensure that the translations are meaning-equivalent, which can be particularly challenging given that MWEs may have different meanings or connotations in various languages. This requires not just word-for-word translation but a deeper understanding of contextual usage and cultural nuances. The ability to translate MWEs accurately is a key differentiating factor among various MT systems [2] [3].

3. **Limited Resources for MWEs**: Another challenge is the limited availability of bilingual or multilingual MWE corpora, which are essential for training and evaluating MT systems on their handling of MWEs. The scarcity of resources can hinder research and development efforts aimed at improving the processing of MWEs in translation tasks [4] [5]. Without substantial parallel corpora that include MWEs, MT systems may struggle to learn the appropriate contexts and usages of these expressions.

4. **Impact on Overall Translation Quality**: The inability to process MWEs effectively can jeopardize the overall performance of MT applications, impacting tasks such as text summarization and web search, where understanding nuanced expressions is crucial. MT systems that do not handle MWEs well may result in translations that are not only incorrect but could also be seen as unfortunate or awkward [1] [2].

In summary, the main challenges faced by MT systems when handling MWEs include accurate detection, achieving meaning equivalence in translation, the scarcity of training resources, and the detrimental impact on overall translation quality. Addressing these challenges is essential for advancing the effectiveness of machine translation in the context of natural language processing.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: be done before one can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWEs successfully [12].The study of multiword expressions in NLP has been gaining prominence, and in recent years the number of researchers and projects focusing on them has increased dramatically. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for NLP, including MT and Translation Technology. The inability to detect MWEs automatically may result in incorrect (and even unfortunate) automatic translations and may jeopardise the performance of applications such as text summarisation and web search.Multiword expressions do not only play a crucial role in the computational treatment of natural languages. Often terms are multiword expressions (and not single words), making them highly relevant to terminology. The requirement for correct rendering of MWEs in translation and interpretation highlights their importance in these fields. Given the pervasive nature of MWEs, they play a crucial
