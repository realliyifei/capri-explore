## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Machine translation (MT) systems face several challenges concerning the translation of multiword expressions (MWEs). These challenges can significantly impact the quality and accuracy of the translations produced by such systems.

1. **Recognition and Identification**: One of the primary challenges is the accurate detection of MWEs. Due to their complex nature, MWEs can sometimes be misidentified or overlooked entirely by MT systems. The ability to correctly pinpoint MWEs within a text is crucial since failing to do so may result in incorrect translations, effectively bottlenecking the MT process [2] [3]. 

2. **Translation Accuracy and Meaning Equivalence**: Once MWEs are identified, translating them in a manner that retains their meaning poses a substantial challenge. Different MT systems may exhibit varying capabilities in accurately recognizing and translating these expressions. Consequently, the lack of uniformity in how MWEs are handled can lead to significant discrepancies in translation quality among systems [2] [3]. 

3. **Integration with Other NLP Applications**: The complexity of integrating MWEs into broader NLP applications, including MT, presents additional obstacles. Many applications rely on correct MWE rendering to function effectively; hence, incorrect treatment of MWEs can jeopardize the performance of tasks like text summarization or web search [1]. Additionally, the integration of MWEs into the learning algorithms of MT systems needs to be improved to account for their peculiarities, further complicating their treatment in automatic translation processes [4] [5].

4. **Limited Resources for Multilingual MWEs**: The availability of bilingual or multilingual MWE corpora is limited, which hampers research and development in this area. A lack of sufficient linguistic resources means that many systems do not have access to a wide range of MWEs needed for training, which affects their performance on lesser-studied language pairs or specific domains [4] [5]. This scarcity of comprehensive resources also poses challenges in benchmarking MT systems for their handling of MWEs.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Existing automatic evaluation metrics for MT often fail to account adequately for the complexity and significance of MWEs. The metrics traditionally employed may not accurately reflect a system's performance regarding MWE handling, which is an essential aspect of translation quality [2] [3]. This gap in evaluation may lead to a misleading assessment of MT systems and their capabilities concerning MWEs.

In conclusion, the challenges faced by MT systems in translating MWEs revolve around correct identification, accurate translation while maintaining meaning, integration with NLP applications, limited linguistic resources, and ineffective evaluation metrics. Addressing these challenges is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of MT systems in handling the intricacies of natural language.

[1]:  Passage ID 1: be done before one can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWEs successfully [12].The study of multiword expressions in NLP has been gaining prominence, and in recent years the number of researchers and projects focusing on them has increased dramatically. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for NLP, including MT and Translation Technology. The inability to detect MWEs automatically may result in incorrect (and even unfortunate) automatic translations and may jeopardise the performance of applications such as text summarisation and web search.Multiword expressions do not only play a crucial role in the computational treatment of natural languages. Often terms are multiword expressions (and not single words), making them highly relevant to terminology. The requirement for correct rendering of MWEs in translation and interpretation highlights their importance in these fields. Given the pervasive nature of MWEs, they play a crucial
