## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information about the LENA System or its methods for analyzing audio recordings to determine language exposure and interaction metrics. Without specific details about the LENA System in the passages, I cannot provide an accurate answer.

[1]: Passage ID 1: as work to date has primarily focused on English or other high-resource languages Mondal et al. (2022) but devoted less efforts towards minority languages. Additionally, the lack of human evaluation of NLP-based health systems has made it challenging to measure their effectiveness in the real world. Current automatic evaluation metrics do not necessarily speak to patient outcomes. Hence, human-centric studies must be conducted in evaluating the efficacy of NLP-powered tools in healthcare.Research Directions.1.Healthcare benchmark construction. Although the documentation of recent LLMs reports very high performance for various medical question answering benchmarks, or medical licensing texts, there are many other tasks in healthcare that lack the data required to achieve similarly good performance. Access to medical datasets is often limited because of privacy issues, and therefore other approaches may be required to compile such benchmarks. Synthetic datasets are one such
[2]: Passage ID 2: sample-efficient lamnguage learning. Having a lower-bound goal (e.g. X hours of interaction achieving Y score) can enable the NLP community to have a more accurate understanding of progress in terms of data efficiency. While such estimates might already exist, getting more precision and depth will further advance our knowledge of language learning.2.Benchmark development in child language acquisition. With the advancement of large language and multimodal systems, there are opportunities to ease and scale child language benchmark construction. For example, controlled experiments on carefully constructed supervised benchmarks can be augmented by large video datasets of children learning language over a long period of time.Additionally, such datasets could be used to train models that are specifically tailored to the way that children learn language, which could enable new ways to understand child language use, as well as the development of models that are able to learn from fewer

Importantly, a long-standing goal in education is to personalize materials and assessments to the needs of individual students, and NLP has the potential to contribute towards that goal.Research Directions. 1.Controllable text generation. Dialog systems and more generally text generation have been previously used in education applications. Within this space, controllable text generation can be used for a more personalized experience, for instance to introduce students to new terms using automatically generated stories related to their interests or to modify stories to be accessible to grade school students with different reading levels. Similarly, while we have seen extensive work in reading comprehension, we can now start to imagine applications where the comprehension of a text will be tested based on a student’s prior experience, as well as previous tests that they have been exposed to, for a more adaptable learning experience.2.Educational explanation

The exceptional capabilities of these models in NLP have garnered widespread attention, leading to diverse applications that impact every aspect of our lives. LLMs are employed in a variety of language-related tasks, including automated article writing [3], the creation of blog and social media posts, and translation [4]. Additionally, they have improved search functionalities, as seen in platforms like Bing Chat [5, 6, 7], and other applications [8]. The efficacy of LLMs is distinctly evident in various other areas of human endeavor. For example, models such as Code Llama [9] offer considerable assistance to software engineers [10]. In

NLP methods can be developed to generate targeted practice questions and explain students’ mistakes in a wide range of fields, all the way from English or History to Physics or Computer Science. These systems will likely improve as NLP evolves to mimic human reasoning more reliably; currently, it is necessary to be careful when deploying NLP in education without a human-in-the-loop, as even when given simple math problems, NLP models (including the most recent LLMs OpenAI (2023)) can often confidently give incorrect answers and explanations.It is worth mentioning that the reception of LLMs in the education community has largely been one of fear due to the possibility of increased academic dishonesty.This has led to courses and universities adopting policies regulating how AI can be used in their courses,
