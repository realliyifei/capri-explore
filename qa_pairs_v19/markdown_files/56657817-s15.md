## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The generation of adversarial examples in natural language processing (NLP) without access to model parameters can be achieved through a variety of methods, primarily focusing on manipulating the input text to induce errors in the model's predictions. Below are some notable approaches:

1. **Character-based Manipulations**: One method involves introducing character errors, such as typos or replacing characters with visually similar characters. This manipulation can be relatively simple and can trick the model while often remaining imperceptible to human reviewers. Studies have demonstrated that this technique successfully increases the error rates of models without needing direct access to their parameters [1].

2. **Word Replacement**: Another approach is the replacement of words with synonyms or contextually similar words that do not substantially alter the original meaning of the input. This method leverages the semantic understanding of language models, creating adversarial examples by altering meaning subtly enough to evade detection by human evaluators. For instance, attacks can aim to replace certain tokens in text, effectively generating adversarial examples that the model misclassifies [2].

3. **Textual Perturbation Techniques**: Adversarial examples can also be crafted via perturbation of the text. This involves slightly altering phrases or sentences so that although the original example is processed correctly by the model, the adversarial example results in a predetermined failure. These perturbations may involve sentence restructuring or adding irrelevant but syntactically correct components, which cause models to misinterpret the input [3].

4. **Using Adversarial Training Techniques**: Some researchers have developed adversarial training methods, wherein training datasets include types of adversarial examples that mimic real-world noise or errors. By systematically incorporating slight modifications that are likely to mislead models, researchers improve the robustness of NLP systems against such manipulations [5].

5. **Simulations and Heuristic Approaches**: Finally, heuristic-based approaches that don't require model parameter access can simulate likely perturbations based on linguistic rules or patterns observed within a dataset. These might include common phrases, idiomatic expressions, or typical human errors in writing. This approach thus leverages natural language properties to generate effective adversarial examples [4].

The challenge remains in the efficiency and effectiveness of these techniques, as generating adversarial examples must balance creating malicious inputs while being natural and convincing. Ongoing research continues to explore these methods, highlighting the importance of addressing the efficacy and security concerns surrounding deep learning models in NLP [5]. Overall, generating effective adversarial examples without model access remains a significant research area in NLP, necessitating ongoing innovation and attention to emerging methodologies.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: state-of-the-art results in several NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019) using models such as Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers, and Pretrained Language Models (PrLMs). However, several works (Iyyer et al., 2018) also reveal that deep NLP models can be fooled by the creation of adversarial examples (Jin et al., 2020). Adversarial examples are synthetically perturbed inputs that are optimized to increase the errors between the predictions of the model and the true labels while being imperceptible to human evaluators (Jin et al., 2020; Iyyer et al., 2018). These developments have sparked concerns about the security and robustness of deep neural networks deployed in NLP applications.To generate adversarial examples, adversarial attack methods manipulate different aspects of the input sentence, from introducing character errors such as typos or visually similar characters (Gao et al., 2018a; Eger et al., 2019) and replacing words without significantly changing the original semantic in

While the majority of adversarial machine learning research has focused on image processing, there has been rapidly increasing interest in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, motivated by the unique challenges and opportunities presented by textual data. In this work, we survey the recent advancements in adversarial attacks within the NLP domain.An adversarial example is a carefully crafted instance created by introducing a perturbation to an original example. This perturbation is designed in such a way that the attacked victim model processes the original example as expected but fails on the adversarial example in a manner predetermined by the attacker. To illustrate this concept, [2] have aimed to perturb a document reading “Save me it’s over 100F” to introduce a specific token “22C” into the output of an English-to-German translation model (see Figure 1).

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: generated for text data is determined by two factors, namely, the naturalness of the adversarial examples and the efficiency to generate these examples (Liet al., 2023). Some researchers have succeeded in detecting perturbations in text using simpler techniques like spell check and adversarial training (Pruthiet al., 2019), while others who used word-level attacks failed to efficiently generate adversarial examples due to the high-dimensional search space (Zanget al., 2019). Thus, efficiently generating adversarial attacks in NLP poses unique challenges. Despite the difficulty, stronger and imperceptible adversarial attacks have been proposed, which pose a significant threat to the security of deep neural networks (Boucher et al., 2022; Ballet et al., 2019). Consequently, several defense mechanisms have been proposed in recent years to counter adversarial attacks in NLP, and the considerable amount of work in adversarial defenses has provided good competition to the novel
