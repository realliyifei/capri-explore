## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The Rule-based Machine Translation (RBMT) approach in machine translation is characterized by its reliance on linguistic rules that are manually specified by humans. This method uses these pre-defined rules, which are derived from monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual dictionaries as well as grammar norms that encompass semantic, syntactic, and morphological regulations, to convert source languages into target languages [2]. RBMT is often recognized as the knowledge-based or linguistics-oriented approach and is notable for its structured framework in translation.

**Benefits of the Rule-based Approach:**

1. **Consistency and Stability**: One of the primary advantages of RBMT is its ability to produce translations that exhibit a high level of consistency and stability. This is due to its strict adherence to the established linguistic rules, which ensures that the translation does not veer away from predefined grammatical and syntactic structures [2].

2. **Quality Handling of Specific Grammatical Features**: RBMT tends to outperform other methods, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), particularly in managing complex language features such as verb tense, aspect, mood, and ambiguity. This can be particularly beneficial for languages that have intricate grammatical systems where rule-based approaches can leverage their predefined guidelines effectively [2].

**Limitations of the Rule-based Approach:**

1. **Labor-Intensive Rule Creation**: Developing and updating the extensive set of linguistic rules required for RBMT can be an intensive and time-consuming process. This reliance on human expertise means that any evolution in language or its usage may necessitate further labor to maintain system accuracy and relevancy [2].

2. **Inflexibility and Domain Limitations**: RBMT struggles to adapt to new domains or contexts for which it may not have been specifically programmed. This inflexibility can lead to poorer performance in applications requiring adaptability or when unfamiliar language pairs are involved. The limitations in handling languages with significantly different grammatical structures compared to the source language also hinder its effectiveness in a broader scope [3].

3. **Resource Intensive**: Given its reliance on extensive dictionaries and predefined regulations, RBMT can often be resource-intensive, both in terms of the computational resources necessary for rule processing and the human resources needed for rule creation and maintenance [2].

Overall, while the Rule-based Approach provides certain advantages in translation consistency and quality regarding specific grammatical features, its limitations in flexibility, resource intensity, and reliance on human labor highlight the challenges it faces, particularly when compared to more modern methods like NMT. As the field of machine translation evolves, these factors contribute to the decreasing popularity of RBMT in contemporary applications [3][4].

We hope that our survey can help researchers to better understand this field and inspire them to design better algorithms, and help industry practitioners to choose appropriate algorithms for their applications.1 IntroductionMachine translation (MT) automatically translates from one language to another without human labor, which brings convenience and significantly reduces the labor cost in international exchange and cooperation. Powered by deep learning, neural machine translation (NMT) Bahdanau et al. (2015); Vaswani et al. (2017) has become the dominant approach for machine translation. Compared to conventional rule-based approaches and statistical machine translation (SMT), NMT enjoys two main advantages. First, it does not require professional human knowledge and design on translation perspective (e.g., grammatical rules). Second, neural network can better capture the
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: machine translation (NMT). Different type has its own features in translationese. There are some work related to translationese in these three different machine translation systems. (1) Rule-based machine translationThe traditional machine translation features rule-based machine translation (RBMT), also named the knowledge-based or linguistics-oriented approach (Hutchins, 1995), which converts the source languages to target languages based on the linguistics-based rules specified by humans. These rules are largely extracted from monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual dictionaries and grammars containing semantic, syntactic, and morphological regulations.For the translation quality, RBMT generally produces the target language featuring consistency and stability without relying on a large bilingual corpus as the translation process strictly abides by the stipulated regulations. RBMT outperforms both NMT and SMT for verb tense, aspect, and mood, as well as ambiguity, according
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: in Section V before making conclusions in Section VI.II Literature ReviewThe current popular approach in machine translation involves utilizing modern neural networks, which are trained on extensive datasets containing millions to billions of parameters. This approach has proven to achieve substantial quality improvements. At the same time, traditional methods are now less commonly used due to their limitations in dealing with new domains and expensive cost and language pairs with significantly different word orders [2].Many works on neural machine translation rely on an encoder-decoder architecture [3]. Cho et al. [4] introduced the RNN Encoder-Decoder with two RNN networks to improve phrase representation using conditional probabilities. This model captures semantically and syntactically meaningful representations of linguistic phrases. Sutskever et al. [5] created a sequence-to-sequence network using multilayered LSTMs to encode input sequences into fixed-dimensional
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: NMT enjoys two main advantages. First, it does not require professional human knowledge and design on translation perspective (e.g., grammatical rules). Second, neural network can better capture the contextual information in the entire sentence, and thus conduct high quality and fluent translations.One limitation of NMT is that it needs large scale of parallel data for model training. While there are thousands of languages in the world111https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language, major popular commercial translators (e.g., Google translator, Microsoft translator, Amazon translator) only support tens or a hundred languages because of the lack of large-scale parallel training data for most languages. To handle those languages with limited parallel data, many algorithms have been designed for low-resource NMT in recent years. Therefore, a review on low-resource NMT is very helpful for fresh researchers entering this area and industry practitioners. Although there already exists surveys on
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: highly automation and efficiency are its two main problems. (2) A corpus-based system with statistical machine translation (SMT) or phrase-based machine translation (PB- SMT) as the primary method uses machine learning algorithms by using a large amount of parallel corpus as input, overcoming the problem of using labor work to boost efficiency automatically (Lopez, 2008); however, it has issues such as with translation for idiomatic expressions, compound words that have to be translated by more than one word, long dependencies, and ambiguous words with different meanings depending on contexts (Nießen, 2000). (3) The currently predominant neural machine translation (NMT) system has gained the most extensive popularity in machine translation domain. In contrast to more established system SMT, NMT makes use of its architecture and capacity to capture complex sentence dependencies, which suggests that it has a great deal of potential to become a new trend in machine translation.
