## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The Rule-based Approach in machine translation, also known as Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT), relies on human-crafted linguistic rules to convert source languages into target languages. This method utilizes comprehensive dictionaries and grammatical structures to guide the translation process, which is predominantly linguistics-oriented [2]. RBMT systems function based on specified linguistic regulations that ensure a structurally consistent translation, primarily focusing on semantic, syntactic, and morphological aspects of language [2].

**Benefits of RBMT:**

1. **Consistency and Stability:** One of the main advantages of RBMT is that the translations produced are generally consistent and stable. Because RBMT operates strictly according to established rules, it does not depend on large bilingual corpora. This leads to a higher level of predictability in translation output, which is particularly important for technical and formal texts where precision is crucial [2].

2. **Quality in Specific Areas:** RBMT has shown superior performance in handling particular grammatical elements, such as verb tenses, aspects, and moods, as well as in resolving ambiguities in language. This is due to its structured rule-based nature, which allows it to apply the correct grammatical constructs reliably [2].

**Limitations of RBMT:**

1. **Resource Intensity:** Crafting the linguistic rules and dictionary entries for RBMT can be labor-intensive and requires significant expertise in both source and target languages. This limits the scalability of RBMT, as creating comprehensive coverage for many languages or dialects is a complex task that is not always feasible [2].

2. **Inflexibility to New Domains:** RBMT typically struggles with new domains or contemporary language use, as it may be insufficiently equipped to handle newer expressions or slangs that fall outside the pre-determined rules. This inflexibility can result in poorer translation quality when the input text deviates from the norm of what has been encoded in the system [3].

3. **Lack of Adaptivity:** Unlike modern approaches such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), which can learn from vast datasets and adaptively improve over time, RBMT systems do not possess this capability. They are inherently static and can only provide translations based on the existing rules, making them less effective in dynamic language environments [3].

In summary, while the Rule-based Approach offers reliable and consistent translations guided by explicit human-designed rules, it is limited by its need for significant resources, rigidity to change, and challenges in adapting to evolving linguistic trends and new contexts. This has resulted in a gradual decline in its use compared to more flexible and data-driven methods like NMT in the field of machine translation [3] [4].

We hope that our survey can help researchers to better understand this field and inspire them to design better algorithms, and help industry practitioners to choose appropriate algorithms for their applications.1 IntroductionMachine translation (MT) automatically translates from one language to another without human labor, which brings convenience and significantly reduces the labor cost in international exchange and cooperation. Powered by deep learning, neural machine translation (NMT) Bahdanau et al. (2015); Vaswani et al. (2017) has become the dominant approach for machine translation. Compared to conventional rule-based approaches and statistical machine translation (SMT), NMT enjoys two main advantages. First, it does not require professional human knowledge and design on translation perspective (e.g., grammatical rules). Second, neural network can better capture the
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: machine translation (NMT). Different type has its own features in translationese. There are some work related to translationese in these three different machine translation systems. (1) Rule-based machine translationThe traditional machine translation features rule-based machine translation (RBMT), also named the knowledge-based or linguistics-oriented approach (Hutchins, 1995), which converts the source languages to target languages based on the linguistics-based rules specified by humans. These rules are largely extracted from monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual dictionaries and grammars containing semantic, syntactic, and morphological regulations.For the translation quality, RBMT generally produces the target language featuring consistency and stability without relying on a large bilingual corpus as the translation process strictly abides by the stipulated regulations. RBMT outperforms both NMT and SMT for verb tense, aspect, and mood, as well as ambiguity, according
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: in Section V before making conclusions in Section VI.II Literature ReviewThe current popular approach in machine translation involves utilizing modern neural networks, which are trained on extensive datasets containing millions to billions of parameters. This approach has proven to achieve substantial quality improvements. At the same time, traditional methods are now less commonly used due to their limitations in dealing with new domains and expensive cost and language pairs with significantly different word orders [2].Many works on neural machine translation rely on an encoder-decoder architecture [3]. Cho et al. [4] introduced the RNN Encoder-Decoder with two RNN networks to improve phrase representation using conditional probabilities. This model captures semantically and syntactically meaningful representations of linguistic phrases. Sutskever et al. [5] created a sequence-to-sequence network using multilayered LSTMs to encode input sequences into fixed-dimensional
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: NMT enjoys two main advantages. First, it does not require professional human knowledge and design on translation perspective (e.g., grammatical rules). Second, neural network can better capture the contextual information in the entire sentence, and thus conduct high quality and fluent translations.One limitation of NMT is that it needs large scale of parallel data for model training. While there are thousands of languages in the world111https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language, major popular commercial translators (e.g., Google translator, Microsoft translator, Amazon translator) only support tens or a hundred languages because of the lack of large-scale parallel training data for most languages. To handle those languages with limited parallel data, many algorithms have been designed for low-resource NMT in recent years. Therefore, a review on low-resource NMT is very helpful for fresh researchers entering this area and industry practitioners. Although there already exists surveys on
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: highly automation and efficiency are its two main problems. (2) A corpus-based system with statistical machine translation (SMT) or phrase-based machine translation (PB- SMT) as the primary method uses machine learning algorithms by using a large amount of parallel corpus as input, overcoming the problem of using labor work to boost efficiency automatically (Lopez, 2008); however, it has issues such as with translation for idiomatic expressions, compound words that have to be translated by more than one word, long dependencies, and ambiguous words with different meanings depending on contexts (Nießen, 2000). (3) The currently predominant neural machine translation (NMT) system has gained the most extensive popularity in machine translation domain. In contrast to more established system SMT, NMT makes use of its architecture and capacity to capture complex sentence dependencies, which suggests that it has a great deal of potential to become a new trend in machine translation.
