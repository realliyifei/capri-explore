## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not adequately address the specifics of annotating non-nominal antecedents or detail three particular approaches to doing so. While it discusses various methods related to natural language processing (NLP) and provides insights into machine learning approaches and knowledge encoding, it does not explicitly mention non-nominal antecedents or delineate clear approaches alongside their challenges. Therefore, it lacks the necessary information to answer the question completely and precisely.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: antecedent resolution. This algorithm started with parsing each sentence in the text, POS tagging and lemmatizing it. These linguistic features were stored in an internal data structure. This global data structure was appended with some other features like base nouns, number agreement, person name identification, gender, animacy, etc. This model also constructed a finite state machine with the aim of identifying the NPs. The parsed sentence was then sequentially checked for anaphoric references and pleonastic it occurrences. The remaining mentions were considered as possible candidates for antecedents and were heuristically evaluated using a scoring function. The toolkit was extensively evaluated on reportage, editorials, reviews, religion, fiction, etc.As the research in CR started to shift towards machine learning algorithms which used classification and ranking it slowly became clear that to beat the machine learning systems, rules had to be ordered according to their importance.
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: knowledge is encoded by an expert in the form of rules that translate text from source to target language. While this approach grants extensive control over the output of the system, the cost of formalising the needed linguistic knowledge is much higher than training a corpus-based system, where a machine learning approach is used to automatically learn to translate from examples. In this paper, we describe different approaches to leverage the information contained in rule-based machine translation systems to improve a corpus-based one, namely, a neural machine translation model, with a focus on a low-resource scenario. Three different kinds of information were used: morphological information, named entities and terminology. In addition to evaluating the general performance of the system, we systematically analysed the performance of the proposed approaches when dealing with the targeted phenomena. Our results suggest that the proposed models have limited ability to learn from external

These techniques could significantly speed up the progress in the field: transfer learning (beyond multiway translation), cross-lingual models in general, data augmentation and synthesis (beyond the automatic translation, which is already used), etc.We list some of the tasks that can aid in corpora annotation and provide the comments how exactly they can be of some use for the purpose.Named entity recognition (NER):automatically labeling entities like names, locations, dates, and organizations

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: antecedents for a given anaphor is a procedure that, as such, has not been addressed yet with neural approaches, to the best of our knowledge.Like many other instrumental tasks, this is a challenge that can contribute to make empirically evident and to appreciate the strength of different neural approaches in handling natural language processing. Grammatical anaphoric binding is thus an intriguing research question open to be addressed with neural approaches, and also with a good potential to provide a research challenge that may pave the way for neuro-symbolic solutions to emerge.Probing for Linguistic Plausibility While providing outstanding performance scores in many natural processing tasks, neural models have been challenged, like in other applications areas, due to its opacity and lack of interpretability, specially when compared to symbolic methods.As a way to respond to this type of challenge, neural models have been submitted to ingenious probing proceduresaimed at
