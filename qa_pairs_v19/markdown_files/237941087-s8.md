## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information regarding the enhancement of performance in biomedical coreference resolution tasks through hybrid approaches. The passages discuss hybrid approaches in a general sense within the realm of NLP and outline various NLP tasks, but they do not explicitly mention biomedical coreference resolution or detail how hybrid methods have impacted that specific area. Therefore, the context is insufficient to address the question fully.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: to adapt dynamic data and generalize the knowledge. Bridging these two paradigms through hybrid approaches enables the alleviation of weaknesses in both while preserving their strengths. Recent studies extol the virtues of this union, showcasing promising results in a wide range of NLP tasks. In this paper, we present an overview of hybrid approaches used for NLP. Specifically, we delve into the state-of-the-art hybrid approaches used for a broad spectrum of NLP tasks requiring natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning. Furthermore, we discuss the existing resources available for hybrid approaches for NLP along with the challenges, offering a roadmap for future directions.keywords: Hybrid NLP , Machine Learning , Symbolic Methods , Hybrid Approaches , Natural Language Processingurl]www.zubiaga.org\affiliation[1]organization=School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London,addressline=327 Mile End Rd, Bethnal
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: the use of hybrid approaches.Figure 2 shows the trend on the number of publications retrieved using the keywords Knowledge-augmented NLP, Knowledge-enriched NLP, Knowledge-aware NLP, Neuro-symbolic NLP111https://www.dimensions.ai/. This shows the surge of interest in the topic of Hybrid NLP, which in turn motivates our survey detailing the current research trend in this topic and the potential future directions.Figure 2: Number of Papers Published related to Hybrid NLPThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background knowledge required to understand the rest of the paper. State-of-the-art hybrid approaches proposed in the literature are presented in Section 3, Section 4, and Section 5 focusing on three fundamental objectives of Natural language processing, NLU, NLG, and NLR respectively. Section 6 discusses open challenges in the development of hybrid approaches. We discuss related survey articles as well as how the differ from ours in
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: tasks in a wider outlook. Specifically, we discuss state-of-the-art hybridization techniques combining machine learning and symbolic methods for a wide range of NLP tasks requiring, NLU, NLG, and NLR. For each NLP task, we analyzed the research articles retrieved using the keywords Symbolic methods, Neuro-symbolic, Knowledge-augmented, Knowledge-enriched, Knowledge-aware, and Knowledge base along with the task name in Google Scholar, as well as other articles related to or citing those. After an in-depth analysis of research articles published during the past 6 years (2018 - 2023), we chose the state-of-the-art hybrid approaches used for each NLP task, and present them in this survey paper. Articles were selected for inclusion in the survey based on relevance to the use of hybrid approaches.Figure 2 shows the trend on the number of publications retrieved using the keywords Knowledge-augmented NLP, Knowledge-enriched NLP, Knowledge-aware NLP, Neuro-symbolic
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: be used to synthesize new knowledge (e.g., the latest research papers on a medical finding), and make that available to the medical practitioners. Further, bringing together general medical knowledge and personal patient information requires new strategies for knowledge integration. Since clinical diagnoses and treatments are high-stake decisions, it is crucial that the NLP systems be reliable and interpretable, to provide clear reasoning behind their predictions. Such processes also require the interdisciplinary collaboration with medical experts to make sure that the system aligns with their domain knowledge and clinical practice.3.Drug discovery. Drug discovery is a critical research area that has often been considered in relation to biomedical and chemical research, but more recently has gained the attention of NLP researchers. NLP methods can enable the efficient extraction and analysis of information from large amounts of scientific literature, patents, sovical media,
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: this survey.Figure 1: Taxonomy of Natural Language Processing ApplicationsThe closest study of our survey paper was presented by Zhu et al. (2023) during a recent tutorial. The authors briefly introduced the knowledge augmentation methods used for NLP. Apart from this study, many survey articles have focused on a particular aspect of machine learning (e.g. large language models (Safavi and Koutra, 2021; Hu et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2023)) or symbolic methods (e.g. knowledge graphs (Schneider et al., 2022)) or a particular NLP task (e.g. text generation (Yu et al., 2022b)) employing hybrid solutions. Further details on the related surveys are discussed in Section 7. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies present the hybrid approaches used for NLP tasks in a wider outlook. Specifically, we discuss state-of-the-art hybridization techniques combining machine learning and symbolic methods for a wide range of NLP tasks requiring, NLU, NLG, and NLR.
