## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Hybrid approaches have significantly enhanced the performance of biomedical coreference resolution tasks by effectively combining the strengths of both machine learning-based methods and rule-based systems. These approaches leverage the advantages of each methodology, thereby improving the accuracy of coreference resolution in the complex biomedical domain.

For example, D’Souza and Ng (2012) introduced a hybrid model that utilized a classifier incorporating syntactic path-based features. This model was able to outperform previous models, whether purely rule-based or learning-based, on the BioNLP 2011 protein coreference task, demonstrating the effectiveness of this combined approach [1]. Similarly, Li et al. (2014) adopted a hybrid approach for resolving various types of anaphora, which involved using a blend of rule-based methods alongside machine learning techniques. Such combinations allowed these systems to adaptively deploy rules depending on the specifics of the data, leading to improved outcomes [1].

Additionally, the integration of external biomedical knowledge bases in design, such as demonstrated by the KB-attention model (Li et al., 2021), has set new benchmarks in performance, achieving an F1 score of 69.5% on the BioNLP test set [2]. This reliance on both learned information from the data and structured external knowledge reflects the nuanced understanding required to address the particular challenges posed by biomedical texts, such as varied terminologies and complex entity relationships.

The evidence from multiple studies indicates that hybrid models not only achieve superior performance compared to their single-method counterparts but also offer a flexible framework that can adapt to the specific needs of biomedical coreference tasks [3]. Miwa et al. (2012) developed a rule-based system that utilized syntactic trees, reaching an F1 score of 55.9%, whereas more advanced models combining both rule-based adaptations and learning algorithms have shown to produce results in the range of 62.0% to higher, indicating the clear advantage of incorporating multiple methodologies [4].

In summary, hybrid approaches enhance the performance of biomedical coreference resolution tasks by merging the strengths of machine learning and rule-based methods, thereby leading to improved accuracy and adaptability in resolving coreference links in varied and challenging biomedical texts. The advancements and performances achieved by these models highlight the necessity of integrating diverse methodologies to tackle the intricacies inherent in the biomedical domain [5].

It trained two separate classifiers for detecting anaphora andantecedent mentions.In addition to using machine learning-based methods only, several models adopted hydrid approach, i.e., combining both machine learning-based and rule-based methods. D’Souza and Ng (2012) proposed a hybrid approach that used a classifier with syntactic path-based features. It investigated five different learning-based methods, and a rule-based approach for anaphora resolution. This model achieved a superior performance than previous either rule-based or learning-based models on BioNLP 2011 protein coreference task.Li et al. (2014) later also used a hybrid approach, adopting the rule-based method or the machine learning method for three types of anaphora. As the method of D’Souza and Ng (2012), they also used different rules for

These models are evaluated using the scorer provided by the BioNLP shared task organisers. As shown in Table 3, KB-attention (Li et al., 2021) achieved the best performance of 69.5% F1 score on the test set of BioNLP. This indicates that integrating external biomedical knowledge base can further enhance the coreference models for the biomedical domain. In addition, compared with deep learning-based models, some rule-based (Kilicoglu and Demner-Fushman 2016, Li et al. 2018) or hybrid models (D’Souza and Ng 2012, Li et al. 2014) still achieved favorable performance.Table 4 shows the F1 scores of different biomedical coreference models on CRAFT-CR test set. We can see that the best performance is also achieved by KB-attention (Li et al., 2021), showing the advantage of fine-grained knowledge base

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Miwa et al. (2012) developed a rule-based coreference system, as a part of the EventMine event extraction system. A set of rules was developed based on syntactic trees and predicate-argument structures. The system achieved 55.9% F1 score on BioNLP 2011 protein coreference task. Kilicoglu and Demner-Fushman (2016) developed a new corpus of structured drug labels and proposed a general framework based on a smorgasbord architecture for fine-grained biomedical coreference resolution. The framework adopted different strategies for each coreference type and mention type, and combined them to reach desired performance, like selecting dishes from a smorgasbord. Li et al. (2018) presented two methods for bio-entity coreference resolution: a rule-based method and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. The rule-based model created a set of syntactic rules or semantic constraints forcoreference and achieved a state-of-the-art performance with 62.0% F1 score on BioNLP 2011 protein coreference
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: ConclusionIn this paper, we review and analyse the progress of biomedical coreference datasets, biomedical language representation models and coreference models for the biomedical domain. Biomedical coreference is an essential but challenging task. Some efforts have been made in this field, but there is still a much room for improvement. The experiments which we conducted indicate biomedical domain knowledge from either pre-training on biomedical texts or integrating biomedical knowledge bases can enhance coreference models for the biomedical domain.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported in part by the China Scholarship Council, and the DALI project,ERC Grant 695662.ReferencesAlsentzer et al.
