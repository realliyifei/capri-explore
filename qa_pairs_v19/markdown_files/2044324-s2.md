## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not include specific criteria for assessing language quality in vision and language datasets. The passages focus primarily on question-answering systems, evaluation scoring, challenges in healthcare NLP applications, and fairness in NLP processes, but they do not provide detailed information regarding assessments related to language quality in vision and language datasets specifically. Hence, the context is insufficient to answer the question completely and precisely.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: or search engine. In the last decades, many QA systems have been proposed to address the requirements of different question-answering tasks. Furthermore, many error scores have been introduced, e.g., based on n-gram matching, word embeddings, or contextual embeddings to measure the performance of a QA system. This survey attempts to provide a systematic overview of the general framework of QA, QA paradigms, benchmark datasets, and assessment techniques for a quantitative evaluation of QA systems. The latter is particularly important because not only is the construction of a QA system complex but also its evaluation. We hypothesize that a reason, therefore, is that the quantitative formalization of human judgment is an open problem.keywords: Natural Language Processing, Question Answering, Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: as work to date has primarily focused on English or other high-resource languages Mondal et al. (2022) but devoted less efforts towards minority languages. Additionally, the lack of human evaluation of NLP-based health systems has made it challenging to measure their effectiveness in the real world. Current automatic evaluation metrics do not necessarily speak to patient outcomes. Hence, human-centric studies must be conducted in evaluating the efficacy of NLP-powered tools in healthcare.Research Directions.1.Healthcare benchmark construction. Although the documentation of recent LLMs reports very high performance for various medical question answering benchmarks, or medical licensing texts, there are many other tasks in healthcare that lack the data required to achieve similarly good performance. Access to medical datasets is often limited because of privacy issues, and therefore other approaches may be required to compile such benchmarks. Synthetic datasets are one such
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: processing approaches such as large language models, AI-based chatbots or healthcare applications is an important issue, that is still unresolved.In this paper, we have conducted and analyzed 14 semi-structured expert interviews with mostly NLP experts in the industry and two algorithmic fairness experts in academia. Our interviewees helped us identify six main criteria and 18 criteria on the second hierarchy level of an open coding scheme for certifying the fairness of an NLP approach.Those criteria are an important building block towards operationalizing and testing NLP processes to certify fairness, from the perspective of the auditor as well as from the perspective of the audited organization.Our interviewees have raised plenty of open questions for future research. For instance: How should a certification process handle the use case dependence of fairness or its non-binary nature and subjectiveness while in a dynamic environment? To what extent would it make sense to make
