## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information to answer the question regarding recent methods modifying token distribution to control sentiment in text generation. The passages discuss sentiment analysis, challenges in analyzing financial texts, and the role of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment evaluation, but they do not specifically address techniques or methods related to modifying token distribution for sentiment control in text generation. Therefore, I cannot provide a complete and precise answer based on the given material.

[1]: Passage ID 1: of the text analysis task, and then the model executes the task based on the description. However, the ambiguous nature of sentiment outlined above raises an important question: How do large language models understand the task of “sentiment analysis” when prompted to do it? If the model’s understanding of sentiment is not consistent with the researcher’s, they may not be measuring what they think they are. Further, if sentiment is a confounded measurement, would text analysis improve if we disambiguate the term and measure more precise concepts? In the following sections I present answers to these questions.2 Data and MethodsI approach these questions by using LLMs to classify documents three different times: once for sentiment, once for emotional valence, and a final time for stance (opinion). I then evaluate which of the classification approaches is best able to recover manual labels from two data sets, and examine how well sentiment classifications correlate with both opinion
[2]: Passage ID 2: the last decade (Guo et al., 2016).The principal research interest for this thesis is the polarity analysis, which is classifying text as positive, negative or neutral, in a specific domain. It requires to address two challenges: 1) The most sophisticated classification methods that make use of neural nets require vast amounts of labeled data and labeling financial text snippets requires costly expertise. 2) The sentiment analysis models trained on general corpora are not suited to the task, because financial texts have a specialized language with unique vocabulary and have a tendency to use vague expressions instead of easily-identified negative/positive words.Using carefully crafted financial sentiment lexicons such as Loughran and McDonald (2011) (Loughran andMcdonald, 2011) may seem a solution because they incorporate existing financial knowledge into textual analysis. However, they are based on ”word counting” methods, which come short in analyzing deeper semantic meaning
[3]: Passage ID 3: language processing (NLP). Understanding such complex text data is imperative, given that it is rich in information and can be used widely across various applications. In this survey, we explore different word representation models and its power of expression, from the classical to modern-day state-of-the-art word representation language models (LMS). We describe a variety of text representation methods, and model designs have blossomed in the context of NLP, including SOTA LMs. These models can transform large volumes of text into effective vector representations capturing the same semantic information. Further, such representations can be utilized by various machine learning (ML) algorithms for a variety of NLP related tasks. In the end, this survey briefly discusses the commonly used ML and DL based classifiers, evaluation metrics and the applications of these word embeddings in different NLP tasks.Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Word representation, Language
[4]: Passage ID 4: Turney and Littman, 2003; Wiebe et al, 2000) worked on sentiments analysis and opinions mining. Nasukawa et al. (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003) showed the high precision result on customer reviews and news articles available over web pages. They classified the specific subjects from a document in positive or negative polarity. This paper’s result rise in interest to other researchers in this domain. The influential 2008 review of Pang and Lee (Pang and Lee, 2008) covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems on benchmark datasets in recent research. Here, we discuss sentiment analysis in NLP, including its different methods, such as supervised and unsupervised.2.1.1 Supervised ApproachIt is based on the annotated dataset (labeled data) to build a prediction model. This approach builds a feature vector of the text, either aspect or word frequency, then the model learns (training) on the dataset and gives prediction for unseen
[5]: Passage ID 5: and stock performance.Index Terms: large language model, sentiment analysis, bias, financial text miningI IntroductionWith the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technology, financial and economic text mining—such as analyzing financial statements, analyst reports, social media texts and newspaper articles—has become an essential tool for investment decisions, understanding economic trends, and improving operational efficiency in financial institutions[1, 2].In particular, sentiment analysis of financial and economic text data has played a crucial role in understanding investor decision-making and market trends.The use of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis has raised expectations for higher quality sentiment evaluation [3, 4].However, since financial and investment decisions typically have significant risk, both accuracy and reliability are required in predictions [5, 6].Therefore, ensuring that LLM outputs are accurate and trustworthy
