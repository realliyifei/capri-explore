## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The WinoGender dataset is utilized to evaluate gender bias in pre-trained language models (PLMs) by specifically testing occupational pronoun resolution within the context of vision-language processing tasks. This dataset incorporates a templated structure to analyze how these models handle gender bias, particularly in their predictions regarding gender attributes associated with various occupations.

Firstly, the WinoGender dataset is built upon the foundational ideas presented in existing frameworks such as WinoBias, with a focus on "gender bias in occupational pronoun resolution" in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) [2]. It aims to stress-test the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) by examining how well they can accurately resolve gender pronouns relating to images of individuals in professional contexts, thereby exposing potential biases wherein certain genders may be more frequently associated with particular occupations.

The WinoGender dataset works in tandem with visual content to create contexts where gender assumptions can be measured. By presenting sentences like “The doctor and her/his stethoscope,” it assesses the model's capacity to resolve gender correctly [2]. This methodology reflects an innovative merge between the visual and linguistic modalities, exploiting the image data alongside structured language input to evaluate how biases manifest across these platforms.

Furthermore, the dataset employs evaluation methodologies that allow researchers to observe model responses to gendered pronouns when presented with various occupational roles. For example, occupational statistics from the US Department of Labor are factored into the dataset to determine what constitutes stereotypical gender roles, thereby enabling a systematic examination of the model's bias towards male and female characters in professional descriptions [4].

In addition to the core evaluation focused on pronoun resolution, the WinoGender dataset allows for a deeper analysis of the reasoning capabilities of VLMs in relation to coreference resolution (the task of linking pronouns to the correct entities). By examining the accuracy of gender resolution in conjunction with occupational stereotypes, researchers can systematically identify and analyze biases that may not only affect language understanding but also have profound implications for the interpretation of visual data [2] [4].

Lastly, this dataset is part of broader efforts in NLP and machine learning research aiming to characterize and address biases inherent in language models, with ties to larger frameworks and benchmarks, including WinoBias, which investigates gender biases in coreference systems more generally [5]. Overall, the WinoGender dataset serves as a crucial tool in the ongoing endeavor to identify, quantify, and ultimately mitigate gender bias within pre-trained models.

Secondly, we adopt the templated structure to test gender bias in occupational pronoun resolution from NLP research, but apply it to the vision-language domain—specifically the WinoGender [19] and WinoBias [20] frameworks, in turn inspired by Winograd Schema [21]. To our knowledge, VisoGender is the first dataset to combine both of these contributions by stress-testing gender bias in visual-linguistic reasoning and coreference resolution capabilities.Figure 1: Resolution of gender pronouns and retrieval with a neutral query. We resolve gender by (i) using zero-shot classification with Cross Models Encoders, such as CLIP, and (ii) next-token prediction with captioning models, such as BLIP. We have an additional simpler task to resolve the gender of a single person, e.g., with a template “The doctor and her / his stethoscope”.VisoGender contains images of a person

[4]:  Passage ID 4: approach completely eliminates bias when evaluating on WinoBias , without significantly affecting overall coreference accuracy.2 WinoBiasTo better identify gender bias in coreference resolution systems, we build a new dataset centered on people entities referred by their occupations from a vocabulary of 40 occupations gathered from the US Department of Labor, shown in Table 1.333Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, 2017. https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htmWe use the associated occupation statistics to determine what constitutes gender stereotypical roles (e.g. 90% of nurses are women in this survey).Entities referred by different occupations are paired and used to construct test case scenarios.Sentences are duplicated using male and female pronouns, and contain equal numbers of correct co-reference decisions for all occupations.In total, the dataset contains 3,160 sentences, split equally for development and test, created by researchers familiar with

For gender bias, men are more likely to be described by professional and excellent words than women. One of our evaluations of gender bias is different from the ones listed above. Inspired by Bechdel test (Bechdel., 1986; Agarwal et al., 2015), we use the topics of dialogue to demonstrate that LLMs treat different genders differently.Gender Bias in Language ModelsExisting works investigating gender bias for Pretrained LMs are mainly focused on single language (Zhou and Sanfilippo, 2023) such as English  Mehrabi et al. (2021); Belém et al. (2024) and German  (Wambsganss et al., 2023). Some studies focus on bilingual aspects (Takeshita et al., 2020). Gender Bias benchmarks such as WinoBias  (Zhao et al., 2018a) and Winogender  (Rudinger et al., 2018) are often used to investigate gender bias in LMs. Both Natural Language Understanding (Gupta et al., 2022; Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Dixon et al.,
