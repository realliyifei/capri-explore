## Answer

The evaluation of text representations in relation to downstream natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks is a critical aspect of assessing model performance in natural language processing (NLP). Evaluation methodologies typically leverage established NLP benchmark datasets, such as SQuAD and GLUE, which serve as standards to measure models' ability to understand and respond to text accurately [1]. These benchmarks not only focus on statistical accuracy in terms of correct answers but also assess several dimensions of a model's performance, including the ability to comprehend context and generate coherent, relevant responses [1].

Text representation models, especially state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, can transform large volumes of text into vector representations, capturing the semantic information inherent in the text [2]. The evaluation of these representations often involves comparing how effectively they can be utilized by various machine learning (ML) algorithms for diverse NLP tasks. The effectiveness of a text representation can significantly influence the performance of downstream tasks, such as classification, summarization, and question-answering [2].

In practical evaluations, researchers may utilize techniques like vector similarity search and encoded representations in relation to users' queries [4]. For instance, by computing cosine similarity between embeddings of user queries and those of documents or answers, researchers can retrieve relevant information based on the effectiveness of the underlying text representations. This process exemplifies how text representations are intimately tied to the performer’s ability to engage with NLU benchmarks.

Furthermore, the evaluation process could also assess representations in regard to the extent to which they support various levels of language analysis [3]. By highlighting the relationship between specific techniques and their applications to NLU tasks, researchers can ascertain which techniques yield superior performance for particular cases, resulting in a more nuanced understanding of how text representations function within the scope of NLP benchmarks [3].

To summarize, the evaluation of text representations is fundamentally intertwined with downstream NLU benchmarks through the use of standardized datasets, vector similarity comparisons, and analysis of linguistic techniques. Each of these elements contributes to a comprehensive understanding of model effectiveness and semantic understanding, crucial for advancing NLP technologies.

Models such as GPT (Achiam et al., 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), Baichuan (Yang et al., 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), GLM (Du et al., 2022), and DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024) have set new standards, demonstrating exceptional performance across various benchmarks. These models have been widely adopted in both academic and industrial settings, highlighting their versatility and potential. However, the evaluation of LLMs is a multifaceted challenge that extends beyond mere accuracy in answering questions. It involves assessing their ability to understand context, generate coherent and relevant responses, and apply specialized knowledge effectively.Evaluation BenchmarksThe evaluation of LLMs has traditionally relied on established NLP benchmark datasets, such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), which focus

In this survey, we explore different word representation models and its power of expression, from the classical to modern-day state-of-the-art word representation language models (LMS). We describe a variety of text representation methods, and model designs have blossomed in the context of NLP, including SOTA LMs. These models can transform large volumes of text into effective vector representations capturing the same semantic information. Further, such representations can be utilized by various machine learning (ML) algorithms for a variety of NLP related tasks. In the end, this survey briefly discusses the commonly used ML and DL based classifiers, evaluation metrics and the applications of these word embeddings in different NLP tasks.Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Word representation, Language

From Table IV, the user can ask: What level of language analysis does this technique provide? What are the techniques for performing other levels of analysis? The answers to these questions can help the user to decide if a specific technique is relevant to the task at hand.Our future work will improve this knowledge base as follows:•To show the relationship between a given technique and other techniques. For example, for text normalization, what techniques can I use together? in what order? For text representation, which technique is better for my case?•To provide information on the available NLP tools that support each technique.References[1]K. Ryan, “The role of natural language in requirements engineering,” in[1993] Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on RequirementsEngineering.   IEEE, 1993,
[4]: Passage ID 4: ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the laws of thermodynamics?” Following a quality inspection of the synthetically produced questions, we assembled a training dataset of 1601 examples, consisting of 120 questions for each of the 12 topics and 161 general questions. We also derived a test dataset containing 364 examples with a balanced class distribution similar to the training dataset.In our experiments, we evaluated three classification approaches: vector similarity search, prompting a LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), and few-shot fine-tuning of a transformer model with the SetFit framework Tunstall et al. (2022). Concerning the vector search approach with the SPECTER2 model, we measured the cosine similarity to compare vectors of embedded user queries with paper embeddings in our vector database to retrieve the 100 most similar
[5]: Passage ID 5: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
