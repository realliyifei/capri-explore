## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Chain-of-thought prompting improves the reasoning capabilities and interpretability of large language models (LLMs) in several significant ways.

1. **Enhanced Reasoning Performance**: Chain-of-thought prompting enables LLMs to perform better on reasoning tasks by prompting them to articulate intermediate reasoning steps leading up to an answer. Empirical evaluations have shown that this method outperforms standard prompting techniques on various benchmarks. For instance, it demonstrated substantial improvements in performance on the GSM8K benchmark for math word problems, achieving state-of-the-art results with the PaLM 540B model [2]. This ability to articulate thought processes allows larger models to tackle complex arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks that smaller models struggle with [1][2].

2. **Emergence of Logical Reasoning**: The efficacy of chain-of-thought prompting emerges particularly in larger models, with substantial reasoning capabilities being observed at scales above 10 billion parameters. This scaling phenomenon is intriguing, as smaller models typically do not benefit from chain-of-thought prompting and may even experience a decline in performance [4]. This suggests that larger architectures possess the capacity to engage in more sophisticated reasoning when prompted appropriately, thereby enhancing their overall ability to solve a wider range of tasks [3][4].

3. **Interpretability of Reasoning**: By making the reasoning process explicit through intermediate steps, chain-of-thought prompting fosters greater interpretability. It allows researchers and users to understand how an LLM arrives at a conclusion, which is crucial for evaluating the reliability and correctness of model outputs. The transparency gained from following the chain of thought encourages trust in the model's reasoning process and can shed light on its decision-making patterns [2][5]. Analyses of chains of thought can reveal both correct and incorrect paths taken by the model, showcasing the model's reasoning logic and its potential weaknesses [3].

4. **Cost-Effectiveness of Annotation**: This approach reduces the need for extensive labeled training data typically required in fine-tuning processes, as it can expose reasoning abilities in off-the-shelf large models simply via prompting [5]. This can be particularly advantageous in a few-shot context where high-quality annotations may be scarce or expensive. The minimal cost of augmenting exemplars with chains of thought makes it a practical option for enhancing reasoning tasks without significant resource investment [3].

5. **Opportunities for Improvement**: While chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning capabilities, it also presents avenues for future enhancements, particularly in ensuring the correctness of reasoning paths. As noted, despite the overall effectiveness, there is no guarantee of accurate reasoning at each step, leading to the possibility of incorrect answers. This ongoing challenge underscores the need for continuous research to improve factual consistency and reasoning accuracy in LLMs [3].

In summary, chain-of-thought prompting significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enables greater interpretability, and presents a more efficient means of leveraging existing models' capabilities without extensive retraining. The emergent properties realized at larger scales further underscore the potential of this approach in the field of natural language processing.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: general approaches have improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts (Lester et al., 2021) or giving models instructions describing a task (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022).Whereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g., instructions that are prepended to inputs), our work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the outputs of language models with a chain of thought.8 ConclusionsWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple and broadly applicable method for enhancing reasoning in language models.Through experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning, we find that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows sufficiently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves.Broadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire further work on
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations. Specifically, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning tasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: ⟨⟨\langleinput, chain of thought, output⟩⟩\rangle.A chain of thought is a series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final output, and we refer to this approach as chain-of-thought prompting. An example prompt is shown in Figure 1.We present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks, showing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking degree.Figure 2 illustrates one such result—on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.A prompting only approach is important because it does not require a large training
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: with a further increase in model scale?What other prompting methods might expand the range of tasks that language models can solve?As for limitations, we first qualify that although chain of thought emulates the thought processes of human reasoners, this does not answer whether the neural network is actually “reasoning,” which we leave as an open question.Second, although the cost of manually augmenting exemplars with chains of thought is minimal in the few-shot setting, such annotation costs could be prohibitive for finetuning (though this could potentially be surmounted with synthetic data generation, or zero-shot generalization).Third, there is no guarantee of correct reasoning paths, which can lead to both correct and incorrect answers; improving factual generations of language models is an open direction for future work (Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and Durrett, 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022, inter alia).Finally, the emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning only at large model
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: spent on participant compensation?[N/A] Appendix A Frequently Asked QuestionsA.1 Why does increasing model scale improve chain-of-thought prompting?The finding that successful chain-of-thought reasoning predictably emerges only at certain model scales is intriguing.Scaling up language models has been shown to confer benefits such as improved performance and sample efficiency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent in the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale models, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.The question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and we made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis.This small analysis involved manually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding (20 errors), one step missing (18

[5]:  Passage ID 5: 2018; Rajani et al., 2019, inter alia) or generates synthetic datasets (Talmor et al., 2020; Zelikman et al., 2022).Compared with these training or finetuning methods, our work shows that various natural language reasoning abilities can be elicited in off-the-shelf language models of sufficient scale simply via prompting.This prompting setup is important because it allows for intermediate step reasoning without a large number of labeled annotations, and because a single model can perform a range of reasoning tasks without any gradient updates.Appendix D Appendix: Additional AnalysisD.1 Correct Chain of Thought AnalysisAs mentioned in the main text, we analyze 50 chains of thought from LaMDA 137B that led to correct answers in the GSM8K dataset.Of these 50, only one arrived at the correct answer through incorrect reasoning (shown in Table 9: “correct by chance”).The other 49 had correct logic and math, with examples shown in Table 8.Five had minor imperfections while
