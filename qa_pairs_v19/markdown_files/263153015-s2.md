## Answer

Chain-of-thought prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities and interpretability of large language models in several key ways.

1. **Emergence of Reasoning Abilities**: Chain-of-thought prompting allows large language models to exhibit reasoning abilities that may not be evident with standard prompting techniques. This approach involves presenting the model with a structured input that includes a chain of intermediate reasoning steps leading to the final output. As shown in empirical evaluations, chain-of-thought prompting significantly outperforms standard prompting on various reasoning tasks, including arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks [2]. This method effectively leverages the model’s scale, as chain-of-thought reasoning appears to be an emergent property at larger model sizes, particularly benefitting models with over 10 billion parameters [4].

2. **Improved Performance on Complex Tasks**: Large language models, such as PaLM 540B, demonstrate marked improvements in performance on benchmarks like GSM8K when using chain-of-thought prompting compared to standard prompting [2]. This indicates that intermediate reasoning steps help the model to arrive at correct answers by providing a structured way to think through the problem, consequently enhancing its ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks.

3. **Support for Few-Shot Learning**: One of the advantages of chain-of-thought prompting is its capacity to work effectively in a few-shot learning context. This means that the model does not require extensive labeled datasets to learn how to perform reasoning tasks [5]. Instead, it can use a minimal amount of examples that illustrate the reasoning process, making it efficient and applicable to a wide range of reasoning challenges without significant extra effort in annotation [5].

4. **Interpretability through Structured Reasoning**: The process of summarizing reasoning as a chain of thought allows for greater interpretability of the model’s decision-making process. By presenting the intermediate steps, users can gain insight into how the model arrives at final conclusions. This is crucial for verifying the correctness of the reasoning and understanding potential errors; for instance, an analysis of reasoning paths indicated that most chains of thought led to correct answers, contributing to overall confidence in the model’s outputs [5].

5. **Limitations and Ongoing Challenges**: Despite its benefits, chain-of-thought prompting does not guarantee correct reasoning paths, which can sometimes lead to incorrect answers, showcasing that not all reasoning steps are validated. The ongoing challenge lies in ensuring the factual accuracy of these reasoning paths and improving the model’s ability to generate correct reasoning consistently, as this remains an area for further research [3].

In conclusion, chain-of-thought prompting significantly enhances large language models' reasoning capabilities by leveraging their scale, improving performance on complex tasks, facilitating few-shot learning, and increasing interpretability through structured reasoning. However, addressing the limitations of this approach is critical for future advancements in the field.

[1]: Passage ID 1: general approaches have improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts (Lester et al., 2021) or giving models instructions describing a task (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022).Whereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g., instructions that are prepended to inputs), our work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the outputs of language models with a chain of thought.8 ConclusionsWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple and broadly applicable method for enhancing reasoning in language models.Through experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning, we find that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows sufficiently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves.Broadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire further work on
[2]: Passage ID 2: of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations. Specifically, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning tasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: ⟨⟨\langleinput, chain of thought, output⟩⟩\rangle.A chain of thought is a series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final output, and we refer to this approach as chain-of-thought prompting. An example prompt is shown in Figure 1.We present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks, showing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking degree.Figure 2 illustrates one such result—on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.A prompting only approach is important because it does not require a large training
[3]: Passage ID 3: with a further increase in model scale?What other prompting methods might expand the range of tasks that language models can solve?As for limitations, we first qualify that although chain of thought emulates the thought processes of human reasoners, this does not answer whether the neural network is actually “reasoning,” which we leave as an open question.Second, although the cost of manually augmenting exemplars with chains of thought is minimal in the few-shot setting, such annotation costs could be prohibitive for finetuning (though this could potentially be surmounted with synthetic data generation, or zero-shot generalization).Third, there is no guarantee of correct reasoning paths, which can lead to both correct and incorrect answers; improving factual generations of language models is an open direction for future work (Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and Durrett, 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022, inter alia).Finally, the emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning only at large model
[4]: Passage ID 4: spent on participant compensation?[N/A] Appendix A Frequently Asked QuestionsA.1 Why does increasing model scale improve chain-of-thought prompting?The finding that successful chain-of-thought reasoning predictably emerges only at certain model scales is intriguing.Scaling up language models has been shown to confer benefits such as improved performance and sample efficiency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent in the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale models, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.The question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and we made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis.This small analysis involved manually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding (20 errors), one step missing (18
[5]: Passage ID 5: 2018; Rajani et al., 2019, inter alia) or generates synthetic datasets (Talmor et al., 2020; Zelikman et al., 2022).Compared with these training or finetuning methods, our work shows that various natural language reasoning abilities can be elicited in off-the-shelf language models of sufficient scale simply via prompting.This prompting setup is important because it allows for intermediate step reasoning without a large number of labeled annotations, and because a single model can perform a range of reasoning tasks without any gradient updates.Appendix D Appendix: Additional AnalysisD.1 Correct Chain of Thought AnalysisAs mentioned in the main text, we analyze 50 chains of thought from LaMDA 137B that led to correct answers in the GSM8K dataset.Of these 50, only one arrived at the correct answer through incorrect reasoning (shown in Table 9: “correct by chance”).The other 49 had correct logic and math, with examples shown in Table 8.Five had minor imperfections while
