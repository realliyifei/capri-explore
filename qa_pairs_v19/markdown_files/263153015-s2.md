## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Chain-of-thought prompting serves as an effective mechanism for enhancing the reasoning capabilities and interpretability of large language models (LLMs) in several key ways.

First, chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning capabilities by requiring models to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to a final output. This method is described as consisting of triples: ⟨⟨⟨input, chain of thought, output⟩⟩⟩, where the chain of thought acts as a scaffold for the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms standard prompting methods across various reasoning benchmarks, including arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning, sometimes leading to state-of-the-art performance [1][2]. The ability of models such as PaLM 540B to excel in complex reasoning tasks like math word problems on the GSM8K benchmark highlights this improvement [2].

Second, the emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning as a property of model scale indicates that larger models possess enhanced capabilities for reasoning tasks that smaller models struggle with. Specifically, it has been noted that chain-of-thought reasoning only becomes effective in models with a scale of around 10 billion parameters, as smaller models often experience degraded performance when attempting this approach [3][4]. This suggests that the architecture and size of LLMs significantly influence their ability to engage in complex reasoning.

Furthermore, by making the reasoning process transparent, chain-of-thought prompting enhances the interpretability of LLM outputs. When a model articulates its reasoning steps, it becomes easier for users to understand how conclusions are drawn, which is crucial for evaluating and trusting model outputs. This interpretability can aid in debugging and improving model performance, as the articulations reveal potential areas where reasoning may falter or where the model misunderstands inputs [3][5].

On the methodological side, chain-of-thought prompting can be executed without the need for extensive fine-tuning or labeled data, making it a cost-effective strategy. Traditional training and fine-tuning methods often require large annotated datasets, while chain-of-thought prompts can elicit reasoning abilities using off-the-shelf models [1][5]. This aspect contributes to the accessibility and versatility of LLMs, allowing them to tackle a broader range of reasoning tasks without significant additional computational costs.

Despite its benefits, limitations exist, such as the model's occasional reliance on incorrect reasoning paths, which can lead to erroneous conclusions [3]. This remains an area for future improvement, with ongoing research focusing on enhancing the factual accuracy of model outputs.

In summary, chain-of-thought prompting enhances reasoning capabilities by structuring the thought processes of LLMs, thereby leading to improved performance in complex tasks and providing greater interpretability in how models arrive at specific conclusions.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: general approaches have improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts (Lester et al., 2021) or giving models instructions describing a task (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022).Whereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g., instructions that are prepended to inputs), our work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the outputs of language models with a chain of thought.8 ConclusionsWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple and broadly applicable method for enhancing reasoning in language models.Through experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning, we find that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows sufficiently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves.Broadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire further work on
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations. Specifically, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning tasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: ⟨⟨\langleinput, chain of thought, output⟩⟩\rangle.A chain of thought is a series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final output, and we refer to this approach as chain-of-thought prompting. An example prompt is shown in Figure 1.We present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks, showing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking degree.Figure 2 illustrates one such result—on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.A prompting only approach is important because it does not require a large training
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: with a further increase in model scale?What other prompting methods might expand the range of tasks that language models can solve?As for limitations, we first qualify that although chain of thought emulates the thought processes of human reasoners, this does not answer whether the neural network is actually “reasoning,” which we leave as an open question.Second, although the cost of manually augmenting exemplars with chains of thought is minimal in the few-shot setting, such annotation costs could be prohibitive for finetuning (though this could potentially be surmounted with synthetic data generation, or zero-shot generalization).Third, there is no guarantee of correct reasoning paths, which can lead to both correct and incorrect answers; improving factual generations of language models is an open direction for future work (Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and Durrett, 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022, inter alia).Finally, the emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning only at large model
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: spent on participant compensation?[N/A] Appendix A Frequently Asked QuestionsA.1 Why does increasing model scale improve chain-of-thought prompting?The finding that successful chain-of-thought reasoning predictably emerges only at certain model scales is intriguing.Scaling up language models has been shown to confer benefits such as improved performance and sample efficiency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent in the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale models, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.The question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and we made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis.This small analysis involved manually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding (20 errors), one step missing (18

[5]:  Passage ID 5: 2018; Rajani et al., 2019, inter alia) or generates synthetic datasets (Talmor et al., 2020; Zelikman et al., 2022).Compared with these training or finetuning methods, our work shows that various natural language reasoning abilities can be elicited in off-the-shelf language models of sufficient scale simply via prompting.This prompting setup is important because it allows for intermediate step reasoning without a large number of labeled annotations, and because a single model can perform a range of reasoning tasks without any gradient updates.Appendix D Appendix: Additional AnalysisD.1 Correct Chain of Thought AnalysisAs mentioned in the main text, we analyze 50 chains of thought from LaMDA 137B that led to correct answers in the GSM8K dataset.Of these 50, only one arrived at the correct answer through incorrect reasoning (shown in Table 9: “correct by chance”).The other 49 had correct logic and math, with examples shown in Table 8.Five had minor imperfections while
