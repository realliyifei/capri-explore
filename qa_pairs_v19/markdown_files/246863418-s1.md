## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not contain any information regarding skipping and early stopping techniques, or their impact on the efficiency of dynamic neural networks in natural language processing (NLP). The passages primarily focus on aspects such as question answering systems, the generation of a synthetic dataset for NLP, and the role of deep learning in NLP, but do not discuss specific techniques related to dynamic neural networks. Therefore, the information required to answer the question is insufficient within the given context.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with text understanding and text generation. The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their

Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: in NLP have leveraged the power of modern ANNs with many propitious results, beginning in large part with the pioneering work of Collobert et al. [9]. In the very recent past, the use of deep learning has upsurged considerably [10, 11]. This has led to significant advances both in core areas of NLP and in areas in which it is directly applied to achieve practical and useful objectives. This survey provides a brief introduction to both natural language processing and deep neural networks, and then presents an extensive discussion on how deep learning is being used to solve current problems in NLP. While several other papers and books on the topic have been published [12, 10], none have extensively covered the state-of-the-art in as many areas within it. Furthermore, no other survey has examined not only the applications of deep learning to computational linguistics, but also the underlying theory and traditional NLP tasks. In addition to the discussion of recent revolutionary
