## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided lacks specific information regarding the differences between recent one-stage supervised models and traditional two-stage approaches in keyphrase extraction. While there is mention of both supervised and unsupervised techniques in the context of keyphrase extraction, no details or comparisons about the models or their effectiveness in different scenarios are given. The passages focus on summarizing experiments and exploring the landscape of keyphrase generation and extraction without delving into the specific enhancements brought by one-stage models over two-stage models. Thus, the context is insufficient to answer your question completely and precisely.

However, when it exists a serious domain discrepancy between the training set and test set, the unsupervised extraction models may achieve comparable performance with the supervised ones.2) Among three commonly-used

Section 2 presents prior work on keyphrase extraction and recent developments in deep contextualized language models.Section 3 details the BiLSTM-CRF architecture. Section 4 describes our experiments. Sections 5 and 6 present experimental results and an attention analysis.2 Background and Related Work2.1 Keyphrase extractionThe task of automated keyphrase extraction has attracted attention from researchers for nearly 20 years (?). Over this time, researchers have developed a wide array of both supervised and unsupervised techniques. In the supervised setting, keyphrase extraction is treated as a binary classification problem, with annotated keyphrases serving as positive examples and all other phrases as negative examples. Supervised techniques employ a machine learning model to determine if a given candidate phrase is a keyphrase based on textual features such as term frequencies
