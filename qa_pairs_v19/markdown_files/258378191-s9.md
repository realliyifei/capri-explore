## Answer (I don't know?: âœ“)

I don't know. The context provided does not supply specific information about recent one-stage supervised models or how they compare to traditional two-stage approaches in keyphrase extraction. Although the passages discuss various techniques for keyphrase extraction, such as supervised and unsupervised methods, they do not detail how newer models enhance or differ from previous methodologies. The lack of information regarding the specifics of one-stage versus two-stage models means I am unable to provide a comprehensive answer.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: a comprehensive exploration jointly both keyphrase extraction and generation using pre-trained language models spotlights a critical gap in the literature, compelling our survey paper to bridge this deficiency and offer a unified and in-depth analysis to address limitations in previous surveys. This paper extensively examines the topic of pre-trained language models for keyphrase prediction (PLM-KP), which are trained on large text corpora via different learning (supervisor, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised) techniques, to provide respective insights into these two types of tasks in NLP, precisely, Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) and Keyphrase Generation (KPG). We introduce appropriate taxonomies for PLM-KPE and KPG to highlight these two main tasks of NLP. Moreover, we point out some promising future directions for predicting keyphrases.keywords: Keyphrases , Keyphrase extraction , Keyphrase generation , pre-trained language models , Natural language processing ,

Section 2 presents prior work on keyphrase extraction and recent developments in deep contextualized language models.Section 3 details the BiLSTM-CRF architecture. Section 4 describes our experiments. Sections 5 and 6 present experimental results and an attention analysis.2 Background and Related Work2.1 Keyphrase extractionThe task of automated keyphrase extraction has attracted attention from researchers for nearly 20 years (?). Over this time, researchers have developed a wide array of both supervised and unsupervised techniques. In the supervised setting, keyphrase extraction is treated as a binary classification problem, with annotated keyphrases serving as positive examples and all other phrases as negative examples. Supervised techniques employ a machine learning model to determine if a given candidate phrase is a keyphrase based on textual features such as term frequencies
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: In the second stage, this candidate set is pruned by selecting the most salient candidate keyphrases, using either supervised or unsupervised techniques. In the supervised setting, pruning is formulated as a binary classification problem: determine if a given candidate is a keyphrase. In the unsupervised setting, pruning is treated as a ranking problem, where the candidates are ranked based on some measure of importance and those below a particular threshold are discarded.Challenges - Researchers typically employ a combination of different techniques for generating candidate keyphrases such as extracting named entities, finding noun phrases that adhere to pre-defined lexical patterns (?), or extracting n-grams that appear in an external knowledge base like Wikipedia (?). The candidates are further cleaned up using stop word lists or gazetteers. Errors in any of these techniques reduces the quality of candidate keyphrases. For example, if a named entity is not identified as such, it
