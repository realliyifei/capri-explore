## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

The provided context does not explicitly address the methods used to identify flexible multiword expressions (MWEs) through linguistic patterns based on parsing. However, several relevant concepts related to MWE identification can be inferred from the passages.

One major method for identifying MWEs involves MWE (type) discovery and MWE (token) identification, as described by Constant et al. (2017). This framework suggests that the MWE (type) discovery task focuses on identifying new MWEs within the text, while the MWE (token) identification task automatically annotates occurrences of known MWEs in running text by associating them with recognized types, which could involve parsing techniques to understand syntactic structures [4].

Additionally, passage 3 mentions the benefit of MWE identification in multiple NLP applications but notes that research specifically targeting the lexical complexity of MWEs is still developing. This indicates a potential link between parsing methods—since parsing contributes to understanding the structure and relationships within sentences—and MWE identification, particularly in how it might reveal complexities within idiomatic expressions or fixed collocations [3].

While the passages discuss the general methodology around MWE identification and explore the purposes and advantages of identifying MWEs, specific parsing techniques for flexible MWEs, such as the exact linguistic patterns or algorithms employed, do not appear to be detailed in the provided context.

Given these observations, it can be concluded that the context does not furnish sufficient details on the specific methods for identifying flexible MWEs through parsing. While there are references to MWE identification methods and tasks, the lack of explicit discussion on parsing methodologies means that I cannot provide a comprehensive answer regarding the specific methods used in this aspect. Therefore, the answer is:

I don't know. The context does not provide sufficient information on the methods specifically used to identify flexible multiword expressions through parsing techniques.

IntroductionThe use of multi-word expressions (MWEs) has become a hot topic in research in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Topics of interests in MWEs include issues such as MWE detection [Maldonado et al., 2017], MWE decomposition, and the integration of MWEs into other NLP applications such as Machine Translation (MT). However, to support research into the multilingual use of MWEs, the availability of bilingual or multi-lingual MWE corpora is very limited. The only freely available bilingual MWE corpora that we are aware of, at the submission

Therefore, we identified that a critical and widely adopted resource for Brazilian Portuguese NLP although mostly proficient in these tests, also presents issues concerning MWE vocabulary and morphosyntactic agreement. These models are the de-facto core component in current NLP systems, and our findings demonstrate the need of additional improvements in these models and the importance of widely evaluating computational representations of language.Keywords: Grammatical Structures Multiword Expression Intrinsic Evaluation Brazilian Portuguese Contextualised Word Embeddings Language Models1 IntroductionLearning computational representations that accurately model language is a critical goal of Natural Language Processing (NLP) research.

Multiple NLP applications have been shown to benefit from MWE identification, however the research on lexical complexity of MWEs is still an under-explored area. In this work, we re-annotate the Complex Word Identification Shared Task 2018 dataset of ?), which provides complexity scores for a range of lexemes, with the types of MWEs. We release the MWE-annotated dataset with this paper, and we believe this dataset represents a valuable resource for the text simplification community. In addition, we investigate which types of expressions are most problematic for native and non-native readers. Finally, we show that a lexical complexity

(2017) did a detailed survey on multiword expression (MWE) processing by dividing it into two subtasks: MWE (type) discovery and MWE (token) identification. The MWE (type) discovery subtask is focused on identifying new MWEs from text and the MWE (token) identification subtask involves automatically annotating multiword expressions in running text by associating them with known multiword expression types. Our general idiom token identification task has aspects of both of these tasks in it. On the one hand, we are interested in identifying whether a particular piece of text contains a non-compositional usage from a given category of MWEs. So from this perspective, our task is similar to MWE (token) identification in that we are annotating text, although in our case the annotation is a binary label applied to the entire sentence rather than an annotation at the token level. However, because the models we train are in principle able to identify new
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: non-scalable to be practical Rajani et al. (2014); Liu and Hwa (2017), required the position of the PIEs in the sentence (e.g., Liu and Hwa (2019)), and focused only on specific PIE patterns, such as verb-noun compounds Taslimipoor et al. (2018). Overall, available works for this task only disambiguate a given phrase. In contrast, we do not assume any knowledge of the PIE being detected; given a sentence, we detect whether there is a PIE and disambiguate its use.PIEs being special types of MWEs, our task is related to MWE extraction and MWE identification Baldwin and Kim (2010). As with idioms, MWE extraction takes a text corpus as input and produces a list of new MWEs (e.g., Fazly et al. (2009); Evert and Krenn (2001); Pearce (2001); Schone and Jurafsky (2001)).MWE identification takes a text corpus as input and locates all occurrences of MWEs in the text at the token level, differentiating between their figurative and literal use Baldwin (2005); Katz and Giesbrecht (2006);
