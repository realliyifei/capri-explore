## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided discusses various aspects of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in the realm of natural language processing (NLP), including their identification and challenges, but it does not specifically mention the methods used to identify flexible MWEs through linguistic patterns based on parsing. The focus is primarily on supervised machine learning approaches and the use of neural network architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for MWE identification [1][2]. Additionally, the documents reference the significance of shared tasks and datasets to aid this identification process, but they lack details about parsing-based methods or linguistic patterns specifically employed for identifying flexible MWEs. Thus, the context is insufficient to provide a complete answer to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: (MT) [17, 16], which depends on a clear distinction between word tokens and phrases, has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs [8, 29]. The usual approach in these applications is to identify MWEs first, and then treat them accordingly. Therefore, detecting MWEs is a key research area in NLP.In recent years, the identification of MWEs has been modelled as a supervised machine learning task where the machine learning models are trained on an annotated dataset. As we explain in Section 2, several datasets have been released to train these machine learning models. Furthermore shared tasks such as SemEval-2016 Task 10 [28] and PARSEME [27] have contributed to develop datasets. In recent years, neural network-based models, and in particular architectures incorporating RecurrentNeural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in MWE identification tasks [27]. Usually, these models utilise
