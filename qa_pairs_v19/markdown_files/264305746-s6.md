## Answer

The definitions of opinion, emotion, and subjectivity differ markedly from the concept of sentiment, highlighting their distinct roles and uses in text analysis and sentiment analysis (SA). 

Opinion refers to a subjective statement, view, attitude, or appraisal about an entity or its aspects, indicating a personal or evaluative perspective from the opinion holder [2]. In contrast, emotion encompasses feelings or affective states experienced by individuals, which are described in both everyday language and scientific constructs [1][2]. The nuances in these definitions underscore that opinions are often evaluative judgments, while emotions are inherently affective and physiological responses.

Subjectivity, meanwhile, addresses "private states" that include sentiment, opinions, emotions, evaluations, beliefs, and speculations. It operates on a broader scope to detect these private states within text, suggesting that subjectivity analysis goes beyond just understanding sentiments to include various personal and cognitive states [2][4]. Unlike sentiment—which is commonly framed around emotional and attitudinal expressions—subjectivity captures a wider range of internal experiences and interpretations.

Sentiment, on the other hand, commonly intersects both emotion and opinion yet is not synonymous with either. It is often used in a more general sense to encapsulate any evaluative or affective response found within text, intertwining both opinions and emotions without necessarily distinguishing between them [1][5]. Despite the overlap, distinctions are crucial; for example, tools like Vader and SentiWordNet treat sentiment as a blend of emotional analysis and opinion mining [5]. Additionally, in sociolinguistic contexts, sentiment is influenced by contextual nuances derived from its definitions, which can vary across disciplines such as sociology, psychology, and linguistics [4].

Therefore, while sentiment can encompass attributes from opinion and emotion, it cannot be equated to either. They serve different analytical purposes within sentiment analysis, and conflating them can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation of data [3][4]. Achieving a nuanced understanding of these terms is paramount for researchers aiming to leverage language models effectively for sentiment classification tasks [4][5].

In conclusion, the distinctions among opinion, emotion, and subjectivity—despite their interconnectedness—are essential for precise analysis in text processing and natural language understanding. Researchers must independently operationalize and contextualize these constructs within their frameworks to accurately capture the intended meanings and implications in their analyses.

I first provide a brief overview of sentiment analysis and how it is understood across different domains, tools, and contexts. I then test how generative LLMs understand the concept relative to the more well specified concepts of stance (i.e. opinion) and emotional valence. Finally, I provide recommendations on how researchers should or should not leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis.Textbooks and literature reviews on sentiment analysis often define sentiment in terms of “opinions, sentiments, and emotions in text” (Liu et al., 2010), or “the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text” (Pang et al., 2008). Indeed, the literature is awash with references to sentiment as both opinion, emotion, and other dimensions of text (e.g. Wankhade et al., 2022; Mehboob et al., 2020; Hutto and Gilbert, 2014; Baccianella et al., 2010).

However, the ambiguous nature of sentiment outlined above raises an important question: How do large language models understand the task of “sentiment analysis” when prompted to do it? If the model’s understanding of sentiment is not consistent with the researcher’s, they may not be measuring what they think they are. Further, if sentiment is a confounded measurement, would text analysis improve if we disambiguate the term and measure more precise concepts? In the following sections I present answers to these questions.2 Data and MethodsI approach these questions by using LLMs to classify documents three different times: once for sentiment, once for emotional valence, and a final time for stance (opinion). I then evaluate which of the classification approaches is best able to recover manual labels from two data sets, and examine how well sentiment classifications correlate with both opinion

Here private states could refer to intellectual factors, such as believing, wondering, knowing; or emotive factors, such as hating, being afraid; and perceptual ones, such as seeing or hearing something Wiebe (1994).Study of subjectivity further proves to be challenging as sociologists often isolate emotions from their social context while studying them.Terms like opinion, emotion, and subjectivity hold distinct meanings and are studied separately. Therefore, they are not synonymous with sentiment. Furthermore, when considering sentiment within a sociotechnical system, it is essential to be aware of the contextual nuances associated with the diverse definitions of sentiment derived from sociological, psychological, and linguistic backgrounds. Given the complex nature of sentiment, it is important to approach it with a nuanced perspective and operationalize it within a structured theoretical framework. Prior research suggests that achieving such nuanced

The commonly used sentiment dictionary Vader, for example, explicitly aligns itself with emotional analysis as a “valence aware dictionary”, then describes itself as an “opinion mining” tool (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014). SentiWordNet similarly positions itself as a tool for “sentiment classification and opinion mining” (Baccianella et al., 2010). Other dictionaries, like the popular Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, avoid any mention of opinion classification and focus entirely on emotional dimensions (Pennebaker et al., 2001). Others still define sentiment in domain specific terms such as “consumer sentiment” or what direction the economy is expected to move (Yang
