## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

In the context of sentiment analysis (SA) within natural language processing (NLP), the terms "opinion," "emotion," and "subjectivity" have distinct definitions and implications that set them apart from the general term "sentiment." Understanding these differences is crucial for accurate analysis and interpretation of text data.

1. **Opinion** is defined as a subjective statement, view, attitude, emotion, or appraisal regarding an entity or an aspect of an entity. It represents what an opinion holder believes or perceives about something (Liu, 2012) [3]. Opinions often reflect personal assessments or evaluations and are therefore influenced by individual perspectives.

2. **Emotion** refers to feelings or states of affect that can be described descriptively (everyday meanings) or prescriptively (scientific definitions). The descriptive definition pertains to everyday usage, while the prescriptive definition relates to specific scientific theories of emotion, which identify and categorize different emotional experiences (Izard, 2010) [3]. Thus, emotions are more intricate than simple sentiments, as they encompass various identifiable states that do not always directly correlate with an opinion.

3. **Subjectivity** is concerned with the detection of private states, which can include sentiment, opinions, emotions, evaluations, beliefs, and speculations. Subjectivity analysis aims to determine whether a statement expresses subjective versus objective content, making it broader than sentiment analysis itself [3]. This focus on "private states" underscores the nuanced aspects of what individuals may articulate beyond mere sentiments.

In contrast, **sentiment** often refers to the overall polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of a text or statement and is frequently used to measure emotional reactions or opinions in a simplified manner. While sentiment can include opinions and emotional content, it does not encompass the full complexity of either term individually. Sentiment analysis can neglect nuances; for example, a neutral sentiment may not convey the emotion or opinion effectively, potentially leading to misinterpretation if used synonymously with opinion or emotion [5].

The reason these terms are not synonymous lies in their fundamental purposes and applications in analysis. Sentiment is often employed as a catch-all term for measuring personal attitudes conveyed in text but lacks the specificity of opinion and emotion. Meanwhile, emotion emphasizes feelings that can be more readily classified than mere attitudes, while subjectivity addresses the broader spectrum of internal states and assertions that may not translate into simple positive or negative sentiments [1] [2].

Researchers should be cautious about equating sentiment with opinion or emotion, as conflating these concepts may lead to misunderstandings in data interpretation, particularly in sentiment analysis frameworks where precision is essential for effective application [4][5]. Therefore, distinguishing between these terms facilitates more sophisticated frameworks and methodologies in sentiment analysis, ultimately improving the accuracy and reliability of findings in NLP applications [2].

I first provide a brief overview of sentiment analysis and how it is understood across different domains, tools, and contexts. I then test how generative LLMs understand the concept relative to the more well specified concepts of stance (i.e. opinion) and emotional valence. Finally, I provide recommendations on how researchers should or should not leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis.Textbooks and literature reviews on sentiment analysis often define sentiment in terms of “opinions, sentiments, and emotions in text” (Liu et al., 2010), or “the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text” (Pang et al., 2008). Indeed, the literature is awash with references to sentiment as both opinion, emotion, and other dimensions of text (e.g. Wankhade et al., 2022; Mehboob et al., 2020; Hutto and Gilbert, 2014; Baccianella et al., 2010). Those familiar with survey research might characterize these

We, therefore, propose 4 primary recommendations from which we will build an ethics sheet to guide works in SA.[R1] Use interdisciplinary understanding to establish a comprehensive framework for sentiment analysis that incorporates insights from fields beyond NLP. Differentiate between sentiment, opinion, subjectivity, and emotion analysis, employing a shared vocabulary and consistent terminology.[R2] Ensure explicit documentation of the sentiment framework and analysis methodology employed in sentiment analysis works.Provide guidelines that outline the expected measurements and quantifications for the model to enhance interpretability and applicability.[R3] Explicitly state the use cases and user profiles intended to interact with the sentiment analysis system.

However, the ambiguous nature of sentiment outlined above raises an important question: How do large language models understand the task of “sentiment analysis” when prompted to do it? If the model’s understanding of sentiment is not consistent with the researcher’s, they may not be measuring what they think they are. Further, if sentiment is a confounded measurement, would text analysis improve if we disambiguate the term and measure more precise concepts? In the following sections I present answers to these questions.2 Data and MethodsI approach these questions by using LLMs to classify documents three different times: once for sentiment, once for emotional valence, and a final time for stance (opinion). I then evaluate which of the classification approaches is best able to recover manual labels from two data sets, and examine how well sentiment classifications correlate with both opinion

Lexicon-based methods eliminate the probability of uninformative expressions and data unreliability by focusing on the polarity and subjectivity of words. A vast amount of work is concentrated on sentiment analysis dealing with positive and negative polarities. However, neutral polarity has an important role, for instance, neutral polarity can help to eliminate irrelevant product reviews from consideration or to shape an opinion of personality. This work concentrates on the application of lexicon-based sentiments with an evaluation of machine learning algorithms with the following contributions.1.Performing exploratory data analysis to elicit insights about the polarity and subjectivity.2.Transformation, inclusion, and study on the impact of lexicon neutrality in sentiments.3.Evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms to provide a guideline for model
