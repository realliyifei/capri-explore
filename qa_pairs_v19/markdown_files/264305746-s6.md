## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

In the field of sentiment analysis, the terms "opinion," "emotion," and "subjectivity" each hold distinct meanings that differentiate them from the broader concept of "sentiment." Understanding these differences is crucial, particularly as researchers and practitioners navigate the complexities inherent in text analysis.

1. **Sentiment vs. Opinion**: Sentiment is a general term that encompasses a range of attitudes and feelings expressed in text, which includes opinions, emotions, and other subjective assessments. An opinion refers specifically to an individual's personal belief or judgment about a subject. For example, saying "I think this product is good" is an opinion, while sentiment would also capture the person's feelings or attitudes in a broader sense, such as their overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction [1] [3]. The distinction is further highlighted by frameworks that categorize sentiment analysis into subdomains—while sentiment may reflect general attitudes, opinion analysis focuses specifically on individual viewpoints or stances [2] [5].

2. **Sentiment vs. Emotion**: Emotion, within the context of sentiment analysis, pertains to the immediate feelings an individual expresses, such as happiness, anger, or sadness. Sentiment can encompass emotions but includes opinions and other subjective assessments beyond mere feelings. For instance, an emotional response like "I am thrilled with this service" reflects sentiment, yet it is fundamentally about emotion [1] [4]. The differentiation is critical, as tools designed for measuring sentiment might not effectively capture specific emotional nuances unless explicitly programmed to do so.

3. **Sentiment vs. Subjectivity**: Subjectivity concerns the quality of being based on personal feelings, tastes, or opinions rather than external facts. While sentiment analysis deals with assessing predominant feelings or attitudes within text, subjectivity focuses on discerning what is subjective versus objective language. In essence, subjectivity determines whether a piece of text conveys a personal view (subjective) or conveys factual information (objective) [1] [2]. For instance, "The sky is blue" is objective, while "I believe the sky is beautiful" is subjective.

These distinctions are significant because conflating sentiment with opinion, emotion, and subjectivity can lead to misunderstandings in analysis outcomes. If large language models (LLMs) interpret sentiment narrowly as a synonym for opinion or emotion, researchers might mistakenly assume they are measuring sentiment when they are only gauging one facet of it [3]. This ambiguity can result in data misinterpretations and affect the reliability of findings, as practitioners may not accurately assess the intended sentiment if their definitions lack specificity [2] [3].

In summary, while sentiment serves as an overarching term that captures opinions, emotions, and subjective assessments, each of these elements offers unique perspectives that highlight the complexity of human expression in text. A clear understanding of these distinctions is essential for effective implementation and analysis in NLP.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: this question and spells out the implications for researchers. I first provide a brief overview of sentiment analysis and how it is understood across different domains, tools, and contexts. I then test how generative LLMs understand the concept relative to the more well specified concepts of stance (i.e. opinion) and emotional valence. Finally, I provide recommendations on how researchers should or should not leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis.Textbooks and literature reviews on sentiment analysis often define sentiment in terms of “opinions, sentiments, and emotions in text” (Liu et al., 2010), or “the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text” (Pang et al., 2008). Indeed, the literature is awash with references to sentiment as both opinion, emotion, and other dimensions of text (e.g. Wankhade et al., 2022; Mehboob et al., 2020; Hutto and Gilbert, 2014; Baccianella et al., 2010). Those familiar with survey research might characterize these
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: questions. Building on these works, we now discuss how practitioners conducting work analyzing ‘sentiment’ in NLP can avoid the challenges discussed in our previous sections. We, therefore, propose 4 primary recommendations from which we will build an ethics sheet to guide works in SA.[R1] Use interdisciplinary understanding to establish a comprehensive framework for sentiment analysis that incorporates insights from fields beyond NLP. Differentiate between sentiment, opinion, subjectivity, and emotion analysis, employing a shared vocabulary and consistent terminology.[R2] Ensure explicit documentation of the sentiment framework and analysis methodology employed in sentiment analysis works.Provide guidelines that outline the expected measurements and quantifications for the model to enhance interpretability and applicability.[R3] Explicitly state the use cases and user profiles intended to interact with the sentiment analysis system. By considering the specific applications
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: of the text analysis task, and then the model executes the task based on the description. However, the ambiguous nature of sentiment outlined above raises an important question: How do large language models understand the task of “sentiment analysis” when prompted to do it? If the model’s understanding of sentiment is not consistent with the researcher’s, they may not be measuring what they think they are. Further, if sentiment is a confounded measurement, would text analysis improve if we disambiguate the term and measure more precise concepts? In the following sections I present answers to these questions.2 Data and MethodsI approach these questions by using LLMs to classify documents three different times: once for sentiment, once for emotional valence, and a final time for stance (opinion). I then evaluate which of the classification approaches is best able to recover manual labels from two data sets, and examine how well sentiment classifications correlate with both opinion
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: of the content and recognition of the opinion holder is crucial to avoid fake or unreliable data. Lexicon-based methods eliminate the probability of uninformative expressions and data unreliability by focusing on the polarity and subjectivity of words. A vast amount of work is concentrated on sentiment analysis dealing with positive and negative polarities. However, neutral polarity has an important role, for instance, neutral polarity can help to eliminate irrelevant product reviews from consideration or to shape an opinion of personality. This work concentrates on the application of lexicon-based sentiments with an evaluation of machine learning algorithms with the following contributions.1.Performing exploratory data analysis to elicit insights about the polarity and subjectivity.2.Transformation, inclusion, and study on the impact of lexicon neutrality in sentiments.3.Evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms to provide a guideline for model
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: regarded Semeval series of annual workshops has similarly taken care to distinguish between emotion (which they call sentiment) and opinion (which they call stance) (Mohammad et al., 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2017).More broadly, however, such care is not always attended to when using sentiment as a measurement instrument. The commonly used sentiment dictionary Vader, for example, explicitly aligns itself with emotional analysis as a “valence aware dictionary”, then describes itself as an “opinion mining” tool (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014). SentiWordNet similarly positions itself as a tool for “sentiment classification and opinion mining” (Baccianella et al., 2010). Other dictionaries, like the popular Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, avoid any mention of opinion classification and focus entirely on emotional dimensions (Pennebaker et al., 2001). Others still define sentiment in domain specific terms such as “consumer sentiment” or what direction the economy is expected to move (Yang
