## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Resolution algorithms face several challenges when dealing with non-nominal antecedent anaphora. One major issue is the complexity of correctly identifying and linking these forms of anaphors to their antecedents. In some cases, the anaphor may involve abstract relationships that are less straightforward than nominal references, making the resolution process more complicated. The research highlights the challenge posed by this complexity, particularly when it comes to abstract anaphors, where algorithms need to go beyond mere identification and engage with deeper semantic relationships [3].

Additionally, the mixture of nominal and pronominal anaphors presents a greater challenge for resolution algorithms. The presence of various confounding factors in natural language, such as differing syntactic structures and varying contexts, can obscure the resolution of anaphoras. The ARRAU corpus, which contains a diverse set of anaphor types, exemplifies these challenges by presenting a blend of nominal and pronominal anaphors, thereby complicating the resolution task further as algorithms must discern the relationships amidst these variations [3]. 

Moreover, the development of effective resolution strategies requires the careful selection of linguistic features. Algorithms must incorporate several features such as gender, animacy, number agreement, and others to enhance their ability to evaluate potential antecedents [2]. The reliance on handcrafted features has historically been a significant limitation, which deep learning approaches have sought to address by allowing for vector representations of words that encapsulate semantic dependencies [4]. Nevertheless, even with advanced machine learning models, distinguishing truly co-referent from non-coreferent mentions remains a complex issue, particularly for non-nominal antecedents [4].

Evaluating the effectiveness of resolution algorithms also entails addressing the availability and quality of training data, especially given the limited datasets for unnatural or abstract anaphoric relationships. Generating artificial anaphoric sentence–antecedent pairs helps mitigate data shortages but does not completely resolve the issue, as the performance is still suboptimal for specific types of anaphors, like pronominals, due to their relatively different structures and usages [3].

In summary, the challenges that resolution algorithms face with non-nominal anaphora involve the inherent complexity of relationships, the necessity for comprehensive feature integration, and the limited training data available. As research progresses, there's an ongoing need to refine these algorithms to handle the intricacies of natural language as it relates to anaphora resolution, particularly in the varied semantic contexts encountered [1] [5].

These fields have seen a consistent and steady development, starting with the earlier rule-based systems (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994) to the recent deep learning based methodologies (Wiseman et al, 2016; Clark and Manning, 2016b, a; Lee et al, 2017b; Young et al, 2018b). Though there have been some thorough and intuitive surveys, the most significant ones are by (Mitkov, 1999) for AR and (Ng, 2010) for CR.The detailed survey on AR by (Mitkov, 1999) provides an exhaustive overview of the syntactic constraints and important AR algorithms. It also analyzes the applications
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: antecedent resolution. This algorithm started with parsing each sentence in the text, POS tagging and lemmatizing it. These linguistic features were stored in an internal data structure. This global data structure was appended with some other features like base nouns, number agreement, person name identification, gender, animacy, etc. This model also constructed a finite state machine with the aim of identifying the NPs. The parsed sentence was then sequentially checked for anaphoric references and pleonastic it occurrences. The remaining mentions were considered as possible candidates for antecedents and were heuristically evaluated using a scoring function. The toolkit was extensively evaluated on reportage, editorials, reviews, religion, fiction, etc.As the research in CR started to shift towards machine learning algorithms which used classification and ranking it slowly became clear that to beat the machine learning systems, rules had to be ordered according to their importance.

Our model outperforms state-of-the-art results on shell noun resolution. We also report first benchmark results on an abstract anaphora subset of the ARRAU corpus.This corpus presents a greater challenge due to a mixture of nominal and pronominal anaphors anda greater range of confounders. We found model variants that outperform the baselines for nominal anaphors, without training on individual anaphor data, but still lag behind for pronominal anaphors.Our model selects syntactically plausible candidates and – if disregarding syntax – discriminates candidates using deeper features.1 IntroductionCurrent research in anaphora (or coreference) resolution is focused on
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: to reduce the dependency on hand-crafted features. With the introduction of deep learning in NLP, words could be represented as vectors conveying semantic dependencies (Mikolov et al, 2013; Pennington et al, 2014). This gave an impetus to approaches which deployed deep learning for entity resolution (Wiseman et al, 2015, 2016; Clark and Manning, 2016a, b; Lee et al, 2017b).The first non-linear mention ranking model (Wiseman et al, 2015) for CR aimed at learning different feature representations for anaphoricity detection and antecedent ranking by pre-training on these two individual subtasks. This approach addressed two major issues in entity resolution: the first being the identification of non-anaphoric references which are abound in text and the second was the complicated feature conjunction in linear models which was necessary because of the inability of simpler features to make a clear distinction between truly co-referent and non-coreferent mentions. This model handled the

This field possesses immense potential to improve the performance of other NLP fields like machine translation, sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, summarization, etc. The area of entity resolution in NLP has seen proliferation of research in two separate sub-areas namely: anaphora resolution and coreference resolution. Through this review article, we aim at clarifying the scope of these two tasks in entity resolution. We also carry out a detailed analysis of the datasets, evaluation metrics and research methods that have been adopted to tackle this NLP problem.
