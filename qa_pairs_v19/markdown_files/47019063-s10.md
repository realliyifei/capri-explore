## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The applications of diachronic word embeddings can be broadly categorized into two main groups: linguistic studies and event detection approaches.

1. **Linguistic Studies**: This category focuses on investigating the mechanisms behind semantic shifts and understanding how and why language evolves over time. It generally utilizes corpora that span longer periods, as linguistic changes occur at a relatively slow pace. Examples within this domain include tracking the semantic drift of specific words, examining changes in word sentiment, identifying breakpoints between different epochs, and analyzing the laws governing semantic change on a larger scale. This approach is beneficial for understanding historical linguistic trends and the evolution of language over time [1][4] [5].

2. **Event Detection Approaches**: This area involves the analysis of textual data to identify cultural semantic shifts that correlate with real-world events. Research typically concentrates on shorter time spans to capture these shifts effectively. Applications include temporal information retrieval, predicting civil turmoil, and tracing the popularity of entities through changes in word vector norms. Such methodologies can be employed not only to enhance user experience in various production systems but also for policy-making purposes in governmental or institutional contexts [2][4] [5].

Both categories represent significant and distinct uses of diachronic word embeddings, allowing researchers to explore both the semantic evolution of language and its relationship with real-world phenomena.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: the task of detecting lasting or emerging armed conflicts and the violent groups involved in these conflicts.6 ApplicationsApplications of diachronic word embeddings approaches can generally be grouped into two broad categories: linguistic studies which investigate the how and why of semantic shifts, and event detection approaches which mine text data for actionable purposes.The first category generally involves corpora with longer time spans, since linguistic changes happen at a relatively slow pace. Some examples falling into this category include tracking semantic drift of particular words [Kulkarni et al., 2015] or of word sentiment [Hamilton et al., 2016a], identifying the breakpoints between epochs [Sagi et al., 2011, Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012], studying the laws of semantic change at scale [Hamilton et al., 2016b] and finding different words with similar meanings at different points in time [Szymanski, 2017]. This has been held up as a good use case of deep learning
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: from scratch, in NLP it is common practice to use existing pre-trained embeddings which have been made available to the community. These embeddings have typically been trained on very large web resources, for example Twitter, Common Crawl, Gigaword, and Wikipedia [5, 6].Over the past few years NLP research has witnessed a surge in the number of studies on diachronic word embeddings [20, 26].One notable example of this emerging line of research is [13], where the authors proposed a method for detecting semantic change using word embeddings trained on the Google Ngram corpus [22] covering 8.5 hundred billion words from English, French, German, and Chinese historical texts. The authors have released the trained word embeddings on the project page [14].The embeddings released in [13] have been successfully used in subsequent studies [9, 12] and over time further datasets of diachronic embeddings have been made available to the scientific community. The authors of [18] released

There are at least three different research communities interested in it: natural language processing (and computational linguistics), information retrieval (and computer science in general), and political science. This is reflected in the terminology, which is far from being standardized. One can find mentions of ‘temporal embeddings,’ ‘diachronic embeddings,’ ‘dynamic embeddings,’ etc., depending on the background of a particular research group.The present survey paper attempts to describe this diversity, introduce some axes of comparison and outline main challenges which the practitioners face. Figure 1 shows the timeline of events that influenced the research in this area: in the following sections we cover them in detail.This survey is restricted in scope to research which traces semantic shifts using distributional word embedding models (that is, representing lexical meaning with dense vectors produced

This has been held up as a good use case of deep learning for research in computational linguistics [Manning, 2015], and there are opportunities for future work applying diachronic word embeddings not only in the field of historical linguistics, but also in related areas like sociolinguistics and digital humanities.The second category involves mining texts for cultural semantic shifts (usually on shorter time spans) indicating real-world events. Examples of this category are temporal information retrieval [Rosin et al., 2017], predicting civil turmoils [Kutuzov et al., 2017b, Mueller and Rauh, 2017], or tracing the popularity of entities using norms of word vectors [Yao et al., 2018]. They can potentially be employed to improve user experience in production systems or for policy-making in governmental structures.We believe that the near future

We covered the linguistic nature of semantic shifts, the typical sources of diachronic data and the distributional approaches used to model it, from frequentist methods to contemporary prediction-based models. To sum up, Figure 1 shows the timeline of events that have been influential in the development of research in this area: introducing concepts, usage of corpora and important findings.This emerging field is still relatively new, and although recent years has seen a string of significant discoveries and academic interchange, much of the research still appears slightly fragmented, not least due to the lack of dedicated venues like workshops, special issues, or shared tasks. We hope that this survey will be useful to those who want to understand how this field has developed, and gain an overview of what defines the current state-of-the-art and what challenges lie ahead.AcknowledgementsWe thank William Hamilton, Haim Dubossarsky and Chris Biemann
