## Answer

The two main categories of applications for diachronic word embeddings are linguistic studies and event detection approaches. 

1. **Linguistic Studies**: This category focuses on investigating the "how and why" of semantic shifts over time. It generally involves analyzing extensive corpora that span longer time periods since linguistic changes occur gradually. Examples of research in this area include tracking the semantic drift of specific words [1], exploring changes in word sentiment [1] [2], identifying breakpoints between different epochs [1], [2], and studying laws of semantic change at scale [1]. These studies often utilize methodologies from deep learning to better understand the dynamics of language evolution [1].

2. **Event Detection Approaches**: This category emphasizes the extraction of actionable information from text data related to tangible events, particularly in contexts like detecting emerging or ongoing armed conflicts and the violent groups involved in them [2]. These applications leverage diachronic word embeddings to enhance the ability to identify relevant events in texts over time, thereby informing situational awareness and analysis.

In summary, while linguistic studies delve into the intrinsic changes in language and meaning over time, event detection approaches aim to harness these embeddings for practical applications, such as monitoring and analyzing conflicts. Both categories highlight the utility of diachronic word embeddings in understanding and leveraging temporal aspects of language in various research domains.

[1]: Passage ID 1: the task of detecting lasting or emerging armed conflicts and the violent groups involved in these conflicts.6 ApplicationsApplications of diachronic word embeddings approaches can generally be grouped into two broad categories: linguistic studies which investigate the how and why of semantic shifts, and event detection approaches which mine text data for actionable purposes.The first category generally involves corpora with longer time spans, since linguistic changes happen at a relatively slow pace. Some examples falling into this category include tracking semantic drift of particular words [Kulkarni et al., 2015] or of word sentiment [Hamilton et al., 2016a], identifying the breakpoints between epochs [Sagi et al., 2011, Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012], studying the laws of semantic change at scale [Hamilton et al., 2016b] and finding different words with similar meanings at different points in time [Szymanski, 2017]. This has been held up as a good use case of deep learning

[3]: Passage ID 3: from scratch, in NLP it is common practice to use existing pre-trained embeddings which have been made available to the community. These embeddings have typically been trained on very large web resources, for example Twitter, Common Crawl, Gigaword, and Wikipedia [5, 6].Over the past few years NLP research has witnessed a surge in the number of studies on diachronic word embeddings [20, 26].One notable example of this emerging line of research is [13], where the authors proposed a method for detecting semantic change using word embeddings trained on the Google Ngram corpus [22] covering 8.5 hundred billion words from English, French, German, and Chinese historical texts. The authors have released the trained word embeddings on the project page [14].The embeddings released in [13] have been successfully used in subsequent studies [9, 12] and over time further datasets of diachronic embeddings have been made available to the scientific community. The authors of [18] released

There are at least three different research communities interested in it: natural language processing (and computational linguistics), information retrieval (and computer science in general), and political science. This is reflected in the terminology, which is far from being standardized. One can find mentions of ‘temporal embeddings,’ ‘diachronic embeddings,’ ‘dynamic embeddings,’ etc., depending on the background of a particular research group.The present survey paper attempts to describe this diversity, introduce some axes of comparison and outline main challenges which the practitioners face. Figure 1 shows the timeline of events that influenced the research in this area: in the following sections we cover them in detail.This survey is restricted in scope to research which traces semantic shifts using distributional word embedding models (that is, representing lexical meaning with dense vectors produced
