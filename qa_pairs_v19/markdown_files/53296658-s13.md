## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

When using entire articles as inputs for fake news detection, additional preprocessing steps are essential beyond the standard text cleaning processes. One crucial step is the identification of central claims from the raw texts. This can be accomplished by ranking the sentences in the article using techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) combined with the DrQA system [1]. The goal of this step is to distill the most pertinent information, which can then be used for effective feature extraction and model training.

Moreover, the preprocessing phase involves various standard actions such as tokenization, stemming, and possibly stop word removal to prepare the text for modeling. Tokenization involves splitting the text into individual words or tokens, which serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis [3]. After tokenization, other techniques like weighting words using TF-IDF are applied to convert the tokenized texts into features suitable for machine learning models. The use of pre-learned word embedding vectors, such as word2vec and GloVe, can also play a vital role in representing the text in a way that captures the semantic meaning, facilitating better model performance [1].

Furthermore, addressing data imbalance between fake and authentic news articles is vital during preprocessing, as balanced datasets contribute to the development of robust machine-learning models for fake news detection [3]. This aids in ensuring that the models are trained effectively, capturing the nuances of both categories of news without inherent biases due to an overrepresentation of one type.

In summary, when utilizing entire articles as inputs for fake news detection, it is imperative to perform additional preprocessing steps like identifying central claims, applying tokenization, and addressing any data imbalance between categories, along with incorporating advanced techniques for feature extraction such as TF-IDF and word embeddings [1] [3].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: introduce the methods for fake news detection.As usual, we first preprocess input texts into suitable forms (5.1.).If the dataset has an entire article length, the rhetorical approach can be used as one of the hand-crafted features extraction (5.3.).If the dataset has evidence like Emergent or FEVER, we can use methods in 5.4. to gather evidence for outputs.5.1. PreprocessingPreprocessing usually includes tokenization, stemming, and generalization or weighting words.To convert tokenized texts into features, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) are frequently used. For word sequences, pre-learned word embedding vectors such as word2vec [Mikolov et al. (2013] and GloVe [Pennington et al. (2014] are commonly used.When using entire articles as inputs, an additional preprocessing step is to identify the central claims from raw texts. ?) rank the sentences using TF-IDF and DrQA system [Chen et al. (2017].These
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: the use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to polarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g., elections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can distort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor of traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake news. Models that use the context of textual data are essential for resolving the fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features within the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately label news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on different architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled classification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using

Addressing potential data imbalance between fake and authentic news articles is crucial during preprocessing and training. This comprehensive and well-curated dataset is pivotal in developing robust and accurate machine-learning models for fake news detection.IV MethodologyOur proposed methodology encompasses data processing, model development, and evaluation processes designed to build and validate effective fake news detection models.IV-A Data Preprocessing1. Data Collection and Integration: The dataset comprises two files: Fake.csv, with 23,502 fake news articles, and True.csv, with 21,417 accurate news articles. Each article includes four features: Title, Text, Subject, and Date.2. Text Cleaning: To prepare the text data for modelling, we applied several preprocessing steps:•Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.•Stop Words
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: neural networks for complex feature extraction and classification tasks. Key Considerations: Shu et al. [7] highlighted that the quality and comprehensiveness of training data are paramount for robust machine learning models in fake news detection. Datasets with a balanced representation of real and fake news are essential for practical model training. Multi-modal approaches that combine NLP techniques with deep learning architectures have shown promise in improving detection accuracy [8]. Bursztein et al. [8] proposed a framework that integrates sentiment analysis with a deep learning model for fake news classification, achieving superior performance compared to individual methods. Constant adaptation is crucial as fake news creators develop new tactics. Constant monitoring of evolving trends and adapting detection algorithms are necessary to maintain effectiveness, as emphasized by Vosoughi et al. [9].Previous research in fake news detection has employed various approaches,
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: violent events that threaten public safety (e.g., the PizzaGate [Kang and Goldman (2016]).Detecting fake news is an important application in the world that NLP can help with, as it also creates broader impacts on how technologies can facilitate the verification of the veracity of claims while educating the general public.The conventional solution to this task is to ask professionals such as journalists to check claims against evidence based on previously spoken or written facts.However, it is time-consuming and expensive. For example, PolitiFact111https://www.politifact.com/ takes three editors to judge whether a piece of news is real or not.As the Internet community and the speed of the spread of information are growing rapidly, automated fake news detection on internet content has gained interest in the Artificial Intelligence research community.The goal of automatic fake news detection is to reduce the human time and effort to detect fake news and help us stop spreading
