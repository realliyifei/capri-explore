## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

When using entire articles as inputs for fake news detection, additional preprocessing steps are necessary to enhance the model's ability to identify central claims effectively. One key step involves identifying and ranking the central claims within the raw text. This is typically accomplished using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, which assesses the importance of words in the document relative to a corpus of documents. Additionally, the DrQA (Document Reader Question Answering) system can be employed to further process and extract relevant information from the texts [1].

Moreover, preprocessing generally encompasses several standard procedures, including tokenization, stemming, and generalizing or weighting words to convert the text into a suitable feature representation [1]. Text cleaning is also critical in preparing the dataset before modeling; this may include removing stop words and normalizing word forms to ensure the data quality remains high during the training and testing phases of machine learning models [2].

Furthermore, the quality and balance of the dataset itself are important aspects to consider during preprocessing. With datasets containing a significant number of instances of both fake and authentic news articles, maintaining a balanced representation ensures that the model receives adequate exposure to both classes during training. This balance is pivotal for robust model performance and generalization capabilities [3].

In summary, when processing entire articles for fake news detection, it is essential to incorporate claim identification and ranking through methods like TF-IDF and DrQA, alongside standard text cleaning processes such as tokenization and stop word removal, while also ensuring the dataset remains balanced and well-curated for effective model training [1] [2] [3].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: introduce the methods for fake news detection.As usual, we first preprocess input texts into suitable forms (5.1.).If the dataset has an entire article length, the rhetorical approach can be used as one of the hand-crafted features extraction (5.3.).If the dataset has evidence like Emergent or FEVER, we can use methods in 5.4. to gather evidence for outputs.5.1. PreprocessingPreprocessing usually includes tokenization, stemming, and generalization or weighting words.To convert tokenized texts into features, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) are frequently used. For word sequences, pre-learned word embedding vectors such as word2vec [Mikolov et al. (2013] and GloVe [Pennington et al. (2014] are commonly used.When using entire articles as inputs, an additional preprocessing step is to identify the central claims from raw texts. ?) rank the sentences using TF-IDF and DrQA system [Chen et al. (2017].These

Addressing potential data imbalance between fake and authentic news articles is crucial during preprocessing and training. This comprehensive and well-curated dataset is pivotal in developing robust and accurate machine-learning models for fake news detection.IV MethodologyOur proposed methodology encompasses data processing, model development, and evaluation processes designed to build and validate effective fake news detection models.IV-A Data Preprocessing1. Data Collection and Integration: The dataset comprises two files: Fake.csv, with 23,502 fake news articles, and True.csv, with 21,417 accurate news articles. Each article includes four features: Title, Text, Subject, and Date.2. Text Cleaning: To prepare the text data for modelling, we applied several preprocessing steps:•Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.•Stop Words
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: neural networks for complex feature extraction and classification tasks. Key Considerations: Shu et al. [7] highlighted that the quality and comprehensiveness of training data are paramount for robust machine learning models in fake news detection. Datasets with a balanced representation of real and fake news are essential for practical model training. Multi-modal approaches that combine NLP techniques with deep learning architectures have shown promise in improving detection accuracy [8]. Bursztein et al. [8] proposed a framework that integrates sentiment analysis with a deep learning model for fake news classification, achieving superior performance compared to individual methods. Constant adaptation is crucial as fake news creators develop new tactics. Constant monitoring of evolving trends and adapting detection algorithms are necessary to maintain effectiveness, as emphasized by Vosoughi et al. [9].Previous research in fake news detection has employed various approaches,

[4]:  Passage ID 4: violent events that threaten public safety (e.g., the PizzaGate [Kang and Goldman (2016]).Detecting fake news is an important application in the world that NLP can help with, as it also creates broader impacts on how technologies can facilitate the verification of the veracity of claims while educating the general public.The conventional solution to this task is to ask professionals such as journalists to check claims against evidence based on previously spoken or written facts.However, it is time-consuming and expensive. For example, PolitiFact111https://www.politifact.com/ takes three editors to judge whether a piece of news is real or not.As the Internet community and the speed of the spread of information are growing rapidly, automated fake news detection on internet content has gained interest in the Artificial Intelligence research community.The goal of automatic fake news detection is to reduce the human time and effort to detect fake news and help us stop spreading
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: news articles. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of news articles, including 23,502 fake news articles and 21,417 accurate news articles, we implemented and evaluated three machine-learning models. Our dataset, curated from diverse sources, provides rich textual content categorized into title, text, subject, and Date features. These features are essential for training robust classification models to distinguish between fake and authentic news articles. The initial model employed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, achieving an accuracy of 94%. The second model improved upon this by incorporating additional regularisation techniques and fine-tuning hyperparameters, resulting in a 97% accuracy. The final model combined the strengths of previous architectures with advanced optimization strategies, achieving a peak accuracy of 98%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying fake news with high precision. Implementing these models showcases significant
