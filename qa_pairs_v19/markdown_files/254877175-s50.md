## Answer

The context provided contains several key insights regarding strategies explored to enhance the selection of in-context examples specifically for mathematical reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs). 

One prevalent strategy is the utilization of **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**. This method allows for improved performance in mathematical reasoning without the need to modify the underlying LLM. CoT prompting facilitates the LLM's reasoning process by encouraging it to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps, thus effectively addressing the inherent challenges associated with mathematical reasoning tasks [2] [4]. It has been shown that while pretrained LLMs can handle simple math problems well, they tend to struggle with more complicated reasoning challenges. The introduction of CoT prompting has proven to be effective in helping LLMs tackle such issues by providing structured reasoning paths [2] [3].

Another strategy involves the employment of **tool-augmented LLMs**, which integrate a range of supporting tools to enhance their capabilities in reasoning. This approach encompasses using specialized models, various heuristic methods, and programming assistance to improve the ability of LLMs to orchestrate multi-step problem-solving processes. By engaging tools that are designed to manipulate data and support natural language processing, these models can effectively improve their reasoning capabilities when faced with structured and unstructured datasets [4] [5].

Additionally, there is ongoing research into **prompt engineering techniques** aimed at maximizing the potential of LLMs for mathematical reasoning tasks. Through careful design of prompts, researchers seek to optimize the input that LLMs use as context for their reasoning processes, thereby enhancing their ability to select in-context examples that are relevant and beneficial for the tasks at hand. This aligns with the broader effort to improve the reasoning skills of LLMs by ensuring that they have access to the most appropriate and contextually relevant examples during their operations [4].

Furthermore, the concept of performing search at a more abstract level of **task states**, as opposed to individual tokens, is gaining traction. This method allows LLMs to consider "thoughts" or meaningful chunks of natural language as intermediate computation steps, which can enhance their multi-step reasoning capabilities. Techniques like scratchpads and tree-of-thoughts are examples of this approach, which emphasize using structured thought processes to assist in solving complex problems [5]. 

In summary, the strategies explored for enhancing the selection of in-context examples for mathematical reasoning tasks in LLMs include CoT prompting, tool augmentation, prompt engineering, and abstract task state searching. These methodologies collectively aim to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs in dealing with mathematical challenges, providing a framework for more effective problem-solving in this domain [2] [4] [5].

Thus, developing models with this skill has been also an essential goal of AI and natural language processing (NLP) (Bommasani et al., 2021).Recently, large language models have exhibited an ability to perform reasoning-related tasks in few-shot settings without requiring any modifications to their parameters through a method called in-context learning.Our goal is to evaluate this reasoning skill in-depth for numerical induction tasks.This section provides background information on in-context learning and introduces our method for measuring the performance gap of the models on numerical reasoning tasks based on differences in

[4]: Passage ID 4: developments have popularized Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 24, 3] as potent tools for tackling complex mathematical reasoning problems [18].Different strategies encompass an extensive range of techniques, including specialized models like [21, 31], Chain-of-Thought or Program-of-Thought [25, 4], or, tool-based compositional frameworks like [8, 14, 16, 27].Progress in the study of mathematical reasoning with structured and unstructured data has been measured thanks to various datasets and benchmarks, such as [5, 30, 17].Tool-augmented LLMs are particularly prevalent in those benchmarks as they combine program assistance, data manipulation, natural language reasoning, and many other tools.These frameworks leverage the increasing planning capabilities of LLMs [26, 2] to orchestrate tools, enabling multi-step problem solving.Figure 1: Example from FinQA [5] with questions over tabular and textual data.Recent studies focus on prompt engineering methods to get the best from
[5]: Passage ID 5: multi-step reasoning, such as arithmetic (Dziri et al., 2023). Our approach is in large part motivated by the poor planning and reasoning performance exhibited by LLMs in these settings.Some recent approaches have employed various forms of heuristic search to improve performance in LLMs (Lu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023), but these approaches have generally involved search at the level of individual tokens. This is in contrast to our approach, in which search is performed at the more abstract level of task states (described in natural language). This is similar to other recently proposed black-box approaches in which ‘thoughts’ – meaningful chunks of natural language – are utilized as intermediate computations to solve more complex problems. These approaches include scratchpads (Nye et al., 2021), chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022b), tree-of-thoughts (Yao et al., 2023), reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), Society of Mind (Du et al., 2023), and Describe-Explain-Plan-Select (Wang
