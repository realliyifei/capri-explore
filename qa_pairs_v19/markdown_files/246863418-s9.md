## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úì)

I don't know. The context provided does not include any specific information on the voting mechanism or how it improves the performance of ensemble-based early exit in dynamic neural networks. While there are references to early-exit networks and ensemble learning, the details concerning the voting mechanism and its specific impact on performance are absent from the passages. Consequently, I can't provide an answer to your question based on the given context.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: For example, categorizing ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù as a positive sentencedoes not require a model containing dozens of Transformer layers. To resolve the aforementioned problems, dynamic neural networks havebeen a significant thrust of recent research in NLP. Dynamic networks can adjust their computational path based on the input for better efficiency, making it possible to train models with trillions of parameters and accelerate models in a low-resource setting.In this survey, we review the latest state of research on three types of dynamic neural networks that have been adopted in NLP: skimming, mixtures of experts (MoE), and early exit, as illustrated in Figure¬†1. These three types of techniques share a common idea of dynamically adjusting computation with respect to input, to save computation through bypassing unnecessary modules in a large neural network. However, they implement the goal via different approaches. Skimming was well-researched in the era of recurrent neural networks (RNN).

However,theresultingincrease in computational complexity and memory consumption becomes a bottleneck forscaling, making these models hard to train and use. On the other hand, itis not necessaryto allocate the same amount of computation to all instances. For example, categorizing ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù as a positive sentencedoes not require a model containing dozens of Transformer layers. To resolve the aforementioned problems, dynamic neural networks
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: 1. E-QUARTIC¬†OverviewSeveral methods for energy-optimized model designhave been proposed¬†(islam2020zygarde, ; park2023energy, ; jeon2023harvnet, ). Lightweight neural networks¬†(islam2020zygarde, ) facilitate edge AI, but often result in low accuracy. Selecting CNN instances from a model pool¬†(park2023energy, ) and early-exit neural networks¬†(jeon2023harvnet, ) can instead achieve high accuracy, but introduce memory and computational overhead that may prevent their deployment in tinyML systems. Moreover, their architectural design makes them inflexible for on-device training. These issues highlight the need to balance the adaptability of small neural networks with the capability of large models. Ensemble learning is a well-known approach for improving accuracy and robustness which combines the outputs of various ‚Äùweak learners‚Äù. However, ensemble learning presents challenges in resource-constrained embedded systems, e.g., increased memory demands, and higher energy consumption. To
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: a prediction whose quality is a function of computation time. Early-exit neural networks have garnered attention in the context of anytime computation due to their capability to provide intermediate predictions at various stages throughout the network. However, we demonstrate that current early-exit networks are not directly applicable to anytime settings, as the quality of predictions for individual data points is not guaranteed to improve with longer computation. To address this shortcoming, we propose an elegant post-hoc modification, based on the Product-of-Experts, that encourages an early-exit network to become gradually confident. This gives our deep models the property of conditional monotonicity in the prediction quality‚Äîan essential stepping stone towards truly anytime predictive modeling using early-exit architectures. Our empirical results on standard image-classification tasks demonstrate that such behaviors can be achieved while preserving competitive accuracy on
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: the era of pretrained language models (PLM), since increasing the size of PLMs can often lead to better performance, although a smaller model can already predict most examples (i.e., ‚Äúeasy examples‚Äù) correctly.The main idea of early exit is to exit inference at an earlier layer, rather than the last layer. Early exit often involves a series of internal classifiers inserted into a large network, providing signals for early exiting. The core of early exit methods is the exit criterion. Based on their exit strategies, we categorize the early exit methods into three classes: confidence-based, ensemble-based and learning-based, as listed in Table¬†3.Despite better performance, speed and adversarial robustness¬†(Zhou et¬†al., 2020a), an additional benefit is that the speed-accuracy trade-off can be adjusted as needed by tuning the exit threshold (Œ∏ùúÉ\theta in Table¬†3), without the need of retraining the model.A main drawback is that early exit is often applied on a per-instance basis,
