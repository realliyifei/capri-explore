## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úì)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information regarding how the voting mechanism improves the performance of ensemble-based early exit in dynamic neural networks. While it mentions ensemble-based methods related to early exits and outlines some general advantages and trade-offs of early-exit strategies, it does not delve into the specifics or mechanisms of voting within these frameworks. Therefore, there is insufficient detail to address your question precisely.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: 1. E-QUARTIC¬†OverviewSeveral methods for energy-optimized model designhave been proposed¬†(islam2020zygarde, ; park2023energy, ; jeon2023harvnet, ). Lightweight neural networks¬†(islam2020zygarde, ) facilitate edge AI, but often result in low accuracy. Selecting CNN instances from a model pool¬†(park2023energy, ) and early-exit neural networks¬†(jeon2023harvnet, ) can instead achieve high accuracy, but introduce memory and computational overhead that may prevent their deployment in tinyML systems. Moreover, their architectural design makes them inflexible for on-device training. These issues highlight the need to balance the adaptability of small neural networks with the capability of large models. Ensemble learning is a well-known approach for improving accuracy and robustness which combines the outputs of various ‚Äùweak learners‚Äù. However, ensemble learning presents challenges in resource-constrained embedded systems, e.g., increased memory demands, and higher energy consumption. To

There have been certain previous surveys touching on the topic of early-exiting, either only briefly discussing it from the standpoint of dynamic inference networks (Han et¬†al., 2021) or combining it with offloading (Matsubaraet¬†al., 2021). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that primarily focuses on early-exit networks and their design trade-offs across tasks, modalities and target hardware.5. Discussion & Future DirectionsHaving presented how early-exiting operates and what has been accomplished by prior work, here we discuss the main challenges and most prominent directions for future research in the field.5.1. Open Challenges.Modalities. A lot of research efforts in early exits have focused on the task of image classification through CNNs, and only most recently NLP through Transformer networks. However, a large variety of models (e.g.¬†RNN, GAN, seq2seq, VAE) are deployed in the wild,

Early exit often involves a series of internal classifiers inserted into a large network, providing signals for early exiting. The core of early exit methods is the exit criterion. Based on their exit strategies, we categorize the early exit methods into three classes: confidence-based, ensemble-based and learning-based, as listed in Table¬†3.Despite better performance, speed and adversarial robustness¬†(Zhou et¬†al., 2020a), an additional benefit is that the speed-accuracy trade-off can be adjusted as needed by tuning the exit threshold (Œ∏ùúÉ\theta in Table¬†3), without the need of retraining the model.A main drawback is that early exit is often applied on a per-instance basis,

However, a large variety of models (e.g.¬†RNN, GAN, seq2seq, VAE) are deployed in the wild, addressing different tasks including object detection, semantic segmentation, regression, image captioning and many more. Such models come with their own set of challenges and require special handling on one or more of the core components of early-exit networks, which remain largely unexplored to date.Early-exit Overhead. Attaching early exits to a backbone network introduces a workload overhead for the samples where the exit at hand cannot yield a confident enough prediction. This overhead heavily depends on the architecture of the exit, its position in the network, the effectiveness of the exit policy and the task itself. Hence, instantiating the optimal configuration of early exits on a backbone network, which balances this overhead against the performance gains from exiting early,
