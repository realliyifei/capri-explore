## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not contain information about a voting mechanism or its role in improving the performance of ensemble-based early exit in dynamic neural networks. The existing passages primarily discuss the general concept and methodologies related to dynamic neural networks, including early exit, but they do not delve into specific mechanisms like voting or ensemble strategies and their impact on performance. Thus, the context is insufficient to provide a complete answer to the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: For example, categorizing “I love you” as a positive sentencedoes not require a model containing dozens of Transformer layers. To resolve the aforementioned problems, dynamic neural networks havebeen a significant thrust of recent research in NLP. Dynamic networks can adjust their computational path based on the input for better efficiency, making it possible to train models with trillions of parameters and accelerate models in a low-resource setting.In this survey, we review the latest state of research on three types of dynamic neural networks that have been adopted in NLP: skimming, mixtures of experts (MoE), and early exit, as illustrated in Figure 1. These three types of techniques share a common idea of dynamically adjusting computation with respect to input, to save computation through bypassing unnecessary modules in a large neural network. However, they implement the goal via different approaches. Skimming was well-researched in the era of recurrent neural networks (RNN).

[3]:  Passage ID 3: and memory demands associated with scaling present a major challenge in the advancement of LLMs.To address these issues while still harnessing the benefits of scaling, dynamic neural networks (DyNNs) engage only a subset of the network for processing each input, making the entire model more flexible and efficient in meeting computational demands under resource-constrained environments.In the field of NLP and the domain of LLMs, current research on DyNNs primarily encompassess the following three methodologies: early exit, cascade inference and mixture of experts (MoE).Early exit is designed to dynamically terminate the inference process at the early layers of deep neural networks (DNNs), thereby reducing computational costs and improving response time [273].The intuition is that the predictions for less complex words can often be accurately accomplished in earlier layers of the network [274].These methods typically integrate a series of internal classifiers within the network,
