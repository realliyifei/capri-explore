## Answer

## I don't know?: False

The two basic classes of coherence relations in discourse are typically characterized as causal relations and sequential relations, with additional nuances found in frameworks that categorize coherence relations into more specific types.

1. **Causal Relations**: These relations indicate a cause-and-effect relationship between clauses in discourse. For instance, an example may include a statement that explains an event followed by a clause that describes the outcome of that event. Such relational structures allow the reader to infer that one event led to the occurrence of another. This kind of relationship shapes the understanding of how different parts of the text relate logically and temporally.

2. **Sequential Relations**: These relations involve a temporal ordering of events or actions within the discourse. Examples include clauses that indicate what happens first, followed by what happens next. Temporal sequential relations help establish a narrative flow and clarify the progression of events over time, making it easier for the reader to grasp the sequence of actions or situations being discussed.

These basic classes of coherence relations are part of a more extensive framework established by various researchers, such as the coherence relations framework developed by Wolf and Gibson (2005). They provided foundational examples like cause-and-effect and temporal sequence within their discourse annotations [2]. Moreover, the classification can sometimes feature additional relation types, such as contrasting statements, which highlight how components of the discourse may oppose each other [2].

Overall, effective discourse is marked by the appropriate use of these coherence relations, ensuring that the text is not only logically structured but also clear and comprehensible to the reader. The distinctions made between different types of clauses and coherence relations are vital for creating robust computational models that can evaluate text coherence, aiding in various NLP applications such as text generation and summarization [1], [4].

Examples of relations between clauses in this framework include cause and effect, temporal sequence and contrast.

Computational models that can assess coherence have applications in text generation and ranking, such as summarization, machine translation, essay scoring and dialog systems.Researchers have proposed a number of formal theories of discourse coherence, which have inspired the development of many coherence models – both traditional and neural ones. Inspired by the Centering Theory Grosz et al. (1995), the entity based local models Barzilay and Lapata (2008); Elsner and Charniak (2011b) formulate coherence in terms of syntactic roles (e.g., subject, object) of entities in nearby sentences.
