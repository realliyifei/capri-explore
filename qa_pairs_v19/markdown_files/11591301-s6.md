## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context is insufficient to answer the question because it does not provide specific details on how polarity modification features account for language constructions resembling negation in sentiment analysis. While it discusses negation detection and approaches to deal with it, it lacks comprehensive information about how these features work in relation to other linguistic constructions that may confuse or resemble negation. The provided passages primarily outline the methodologies for detecting and dealing with negation, but there is no mention of language constructions that resemble negation or how polarity modification features address them.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: tool, we answered the following two questions:•RQ1: How do we detect negation in a given text?•RQ2: How can a automated system apply negation to appropriate words to improve sentiment analysis?NLP was used mainly because it guides the extraction of information from texts in their natural form. The most frequent lexicon-based technique for negation is to reverse the polarity of the object that is affected by the negator in a sentence (Jurek et al., 2015). This study presents an alternative approach by developing a disambiguation function that can be used to average out the polarity scores of the negated word antonyms using five dictionaries. Beyond sentiment detection, we propose using antonyms to construct a human-readable semantic construction of the entire sentence, taking a context-based approach into consideration. First, detecting negation in a sentence requires the use of an automated decontraction system, as some negations may be in contraction mode e.g.,

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: The trick here is also that tokens are read at the same time and not in order (either left-to-right or right-to-left). This allows BERT to take the context of each word into account. Similar in its construction, XLNet (Topal et al., 2021) improved its masking mechanism with peculiar assumptions during its pre-training stage, and improved over the work done by BERT. Despite these advances, studies (Ettinger, 2020) have shown that even these approaches have still struggled with negation. Which is why this study aims to examine the problem in a holistic manner.3. MethodologyThis paper addressed two research problems by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, a lexicon-based approach, and sequence labeling.

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: some relevant previous work on sentiment analysis more generally, and finally provide some background on previous work on multi-task learning in NLP.2.1 Negation in sentiment modelsNegation is a frequent linguistic phenomenon which has a direct impact on sentiment analysis \@internalciteWiegand2010. Within the framework of lexicon-based sentiment analysis, researchers first attempted to model negation with simple heuristics, such as reversing \@internalciteHuandLiu2004,Polanyi2006,Kennedy2005 or modifying \@internalciteTaboada2011 the polarity signal of a negated word. This approach to tackle contextual valence shifting generally assumes that the final polarity of a text is some function of the prior polarities of adjectives, verbs, and nouns found in the text. The scope of negation is determined heuristically, by finding common negation cues and assuming all words between the cue and the next punctuation are in scope \@internalciteHuandLiu2004 or based on the distance from the
