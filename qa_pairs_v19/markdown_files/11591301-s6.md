## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Polarity modification features account for language constructions resembling negation in sentiment analysis through a variety of approaches that recognize and appropriately handle variations in how negation manifests in text. These features are essential since negation significantly influences the polarity of sentiments expressed.

One common strategy involves reversing the polarity of words affected by negators. Traditional lexicon-based models have aimed to implement simple heuristics that work on the premise that the presence of a negation word (like "not") alters the sentiment of the words that follow it within a specific scope. For instance, classic research suggests that the final polarity of a text can be calculated as a function of the polarities of individual adjectives, verbs, and nouns, with heuristics used to determine the scope of negation—typically defined by the distance from negation cues to punctuation marks or other signal words [4]. This error-prone assumption has led some studies to enhance detection mechanisms by identifying various contextual cues beyond simple negation words [3].

More advanced methodologies, such as those using compositional semantics, dissect sentences into their semantic components to learn sentiment polarities from sub-sentences. This approach accounts for "content word negators," which include specific words that inherently indicate negation beyond basic function words like "not." By identifying these content negators, the sentiment polarities from the different semantic components can be computed and then combined to form an overall sentiment polarity, improving accuracy in sentiment classification [3].

Moreover, contemporary models such as BERT and XLNet have made significant strides in understanding context in language, although they continue to struggle with negation [2][5]. The non-linear reading strategies employed by these models allow them to analyze words within their broader contextual landscape, which helps to mitigate the pitfalls of traditional linear approaches that might misinterpret the polarity. However, existing studies show that even these sophisticated models need more novel approaches to adequately address the complications posed by negation, highlighting the ongoing challenges in the field [4][5].

In summary, polarity modification features integrate heuristics that account for central negation signals, use more nuanced semantic breakdowns, and aspire for comprehensive contextual understanding as seen in recent deep learning models. These layers of understanding aim to more accurately reflect the true sentiment expressed in complex language constructions that involve negation. Consequently, further innovations continue to be essential for improving the handling of negation in sentiment analysis.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: tool, we answered the following two questions:•RQ1: How do we detect negation in a given text?•RQ2: How can a automated system apply negation to appropriate words to improve sentiment analysis?NLP was used mainly because it guides the extraction of information from texts in their natural form. The most frequent lexicon-based technique for negation is to reverse the polarity of the object that is affected by the negator in a sentence (Jurek et al., 2015). This study presents an alternative approach by developing a disambiguation function that can be used to average out the polarity scores of the negated word antonyms using five dictionaries. Beyond sentiment detection, we propose using antonyms to construct a human-readable semantic construction of the entire sentence, taking a context-based approach into consideration. First, detecting negation in a sentence requires the use of an automated decontraction system, as some negations may be in contraction mode e.g.,
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: The trick here is also that tokens are read at the same time and not in order (either left-to-right or right-to-left). This allows BERT to take the context of each word into account. Similar in its construction, XLNet (Topal et al., 2021) improved its masking mechanism with peculiar assumptions during its pre-training stage, and improved over the work done by BERT. Despite these advances, studies (Ettinger, 2020) have shown that even these approaches have still struggled with negation. Which is why this study aims to examine the problem in a holistic manner.3. MethodologyThis paper addressed two research problems by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, a lexicon-based approach, and sequence labeling. To guide the design of the aforementioned automated tool, we answered the following two questions:•RQ1: How do we detect negation in a given text?•RQ2: How can a automated system apply negation to appropriate words to improve sentiment
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: Wilson et al,[23] performed manual annotation of contextual polarities in the MPQA corpus to train a classifier with a combination of ten features resulting to 65.7% accuracy giving room for more improvement.Choi and Cardie,[24] proposed a compositional semantics approach to learn the polarity of sentiments from the sub-sentential level of opinionated expressions. The compositional semantic approach breaks the lexical constituents of an expression into different semantic components. Thus, the work used content word negators (e.g. sceptic, disbelief) to identify the sentiment polarities from the different semantic components of the expression. Content word negators are negation words other than function words such as not, but, never and so on. Identified sentiment polarities are then combined using a set of heuristic rules to form an overall sentiment polarity feature which can then be used to train machine learning techniques. Interestingly, on the Multi-Perspective Question
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: some relevant previous work on sentiment analysis more generally, and finally provide some background on previous work on multi-task learning in NLP.2.1 Negation in sentiment modelsNegation is a frequent linguistic phenomenon which has a direct impact on sentiment analysis \@internalciteWiegand2010. Within the framework of lexicon-based sentiment analysis, researchers first attempted to model negation with simple heuristics, such as reversing \@internalciteHuandLiu2004,Polanyi2006,Kennedy2005 or modifying \@internalciteTaboada2011 the polarity signal of a negated word. This approach to tackle contextual valence shifting generally assumes that the final polarity of a text is some function of the prior polarities of adjectives, verbs, and nouns found in the text. The scope of negation is determined heuristically, by finding common negation cues and assuming all words between the cue and the next punctuation are in scope \@internalciteHuandLiu2004 or based on the distance from the
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: 2019). The applicability of NLP comes in a variety of forms. In our everyday discourse, such as social media conversations, negation signals are employed. In practice, some NLP techniques used in this space are Word2Vec and GloVe (Yu et al., 2017). BERT and XLNet deliver state-of-the-art outcomes as well (Devlin et al., 2018). However, each model has its own set of constraints. Most algorithms underperform when confronted with negation, which is why it is critical to identify novel approaches to overcome this issue in the NLP domain.2.5. Word Negation and Sequence LabelingThe accuracy of NLP models such as sentiment or perception analysis depends on word negation and sequence labeling. Some NLP models typically work by analyzing each word, or sequence of words, independently. These algorithms deconstruct text into its minimum units called tokens (Webster and Kit, 1992). Once these tokens have been cleaned up, the algorithms read each word or tokenized entity independently and
