## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The "pre-train, fine-tune" strategy is extensively employed in recommendation systems to enhance performance by leveraging knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models. This approach involves two main phases: pre-training a model on a vast corpus of data to learn general representations and then fine-tuning this model on a smaller, task-specific dataset tailored for particular recommendation tasks.

1. **Pre-Training Phase**: In this initial step, the model is exposed to large datasets without specific task objectives. The advantages of this phase include improved model initialization, leading to better generalization across various downstream recommendation scenarios, and accelerated convergence during subsequent training [1]. Additionally, pre-training allows the model to acquire extensive, universal knowledge, which can significantly benefit the performance of the recommendation systems during the fine-tuning phase [1].

2. **Fine-Tuning Phase**: After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned on a smaller, domain-specific dataset relevant to the intended recommendation application. This process adjusts the model's parameters to fit more closely to the specific characteristics of the recommendation task. Fine-tuning may involve training on datasets particular to user preferences, item descriptions, and other relevant information. It has been shown that various fine-tuning methods, including Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, are applied to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks.[3][4].

3. **Utilization and Challenges**: While the pre-train and fine-tune strategy has demonstrated significant success, challenges exist concerning the fine-tuning process. Some research indicates that fine-tuning only specific parts of the model, like the output layer, can lead to suboptimal performance in practical scenarios [2]. Similarly, the performance enhancement during fine-tuning can be inconsistent, depending on both the pre-trained model and the nature of the task at hand [2]. This highlights the necessity for careful consideration of which layers to fine-tune and how to structure the fine-tuning dataset.

4. **Advanced Techniques**: In light of the challenges mentioned, recent approaches have focused on optimizing the fine-tuning processes further. For instance, researchers have explored compressing large pre-trained models into smaller versions to improve efficiency in recommendations [2]. Additionally, focusing on enhancing the fine-tuning process can facilitate faster adaptation of the models without excessive resource use, which is crucial in real-world applications where computational efficiency is essential [2][4].

In conclusion, the "pre-train, fine-tune" strategy allows recommendation systems to harness the robust capabilities of pre-trained language models through extensive general knowledge gained during pre-training, followed by specialized adjustments in fine-tuning that better align the model with specific recommendation tasks and user needs. However, careful management of the fine-tuning process is essential to ensure desirable outcomes.

Figure 2(a) presents the statistics of recent publications of LMRSs grouped by different training strategies and the total number of published research works each year. Figure 2(b) shows the taxonomy and some corresponding representative LMRSs.4.1 Pre-train, fine-tune paradigm for RSThe “pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm attracts increasing attention from researchers in the recommendation field due to several advantages: 1) Pre-training provides a better model initialization, which usually leads to better generalization on different downstream recommendation tasks, improves recommendation performance from various perspectives, and speeds up convergence on the fine-tuning stage; 2) Pre-training on huge source corpus can learn universal knowledge which can be beneficial for the downstream recommenders; 3)
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: great success of pre-trained models in multiple recommendation tasks, how to maintain and update such complex and large-scale models without affecting the efficiency and accuracy of recommendations in reality needs more attention. Some works have proposed improving model updating efficiency by fine-tuning a partial pre-trained model or an extra part with far fewer parameters than the model’s magnitude. However, Yuan et al. (2020b) empirically found that fine-tuning only the output layer often resulted in poor performance in recommendation scenarios. While properly fine-tuning the last few layers sometimes offered promising performance, the improvements were quite unstable and depended on the pre-trained model and tasks. Yu et al. (2022) proposed compressing large pre-trained language models into student models to improve recommendation efficiency, while Yang et al. (2022b) focused on accelerating the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models and reducing GPU memory footprint for news

Different from traditional recommendation systems, the LLM-based models can capture contextual information, comprehending user queries, item descriptions, and other textual data more efficiently.[7] Based on PLMs, fine-tuning strategy involves training the model on a smaller task-specific dataset. This dataset is typically related to a specific application or domain, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, question answering, or recommender systems. However, fine-tuning large language models on specific downstream tasks paradigm usually needs to

Built on transformer-based architectures with billions of parameters, these models undergo extensive training on large-scale datasets, which equips them with capabilities for handling complex natural language processing tasks. However, these pre-trained models often face challenges in domains that demand specialized knowledge, such as medical fields (Jin et al., 2021; Pal et al., 2022) and legal services (Yue et al., 2023). To address these limitations, recent research have focused on fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs to adapt them to specialized tasks. This process involves training a pre-trained model on a smaller task-specific dataset while retaining most of its learned parameters.Common fine-tuning methods such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2024), supervised fine-tuning (Mecklenburg et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2023), and Q-LoRA method (Dettmers et al., 2023) have been widely

Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has sparked increased enthusiasm for leveraging the capabilities of these models to elevate and improve recommendation systems.With the thriving of pre-training in NLP, many language models have been pre-trained on large scale unsupervised corpora, and then fine-tuned for downstream tasks. The transformer architecture[3], was introduced in 2017, has become a foundation in LLMs.Based on Transformer architecture, many Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have emerged. GPT series[4], developed by OpenAI, and BERT[5], developed by Google, represent two prominent approaches to leverage transformers for PLMs. The key advantage of incorporating PLMs into recommendation systems lies in their ability to extract high-quality representations of textual features and leverage the extensive external knowledge
