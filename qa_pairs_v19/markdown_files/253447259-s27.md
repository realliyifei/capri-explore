## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not mention multi-task learning or its applications specifically in improving grammatical error correction (GEC) in learner writing. The context focuses on the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in GEC, touching upon tasks like translation and summarization, but lacks details on specific methodologies such as multi-task learning or how it applies to GEC in language learners' writing. Without this information, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to your question.
