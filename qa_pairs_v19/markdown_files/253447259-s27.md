## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not explicitly mention multi-task learning or outline its applications in improving grammatical error correction in learner writing. The passages focus on various studies, papers, and authors related to grammatical error correction, but lack specific details on the techniques or results pertaining to multi-task learning in this context. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer.
