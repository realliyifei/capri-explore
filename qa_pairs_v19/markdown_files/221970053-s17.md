## Answer (I don't know?: âœ“)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any specific information regarding the two approaches for predicting probability in language model-based methods or which approach yields better performance. The passages focus primarily on general descriptions of natural language processing (NLP) and some related tasks like text classification and question answering, without detailing specific methodologies for probabilistic prediction in language models.

Some of the common tasks in NLP are machine translation, text classification and text generation. Deep learning has been widely applied to solve real-world NLP problems. This section presents the recent advancements in deep learning models that have been designed for NLP over the past few years.4.3.1 Text ClassificationText classification known as text categorization, is a task that involves assigning predefined categories or labels to a piece of text based on its content. The task is commonly used in various applications such as document classification, sentiment analysis

The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence.
