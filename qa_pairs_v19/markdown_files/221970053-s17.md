## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain information regarding approaches for predicting probability in language model-based methods. The passages primarily discuss the general aspects of natural language processing (NLP), the tasks involved (like text classification), and concerns regarding the interpretability of models used in NLP. There is no mention of specific approaches for predicting probability or a comparison of their performance. Therefore, the context is insufficient to answer your question adequately.

Some of the common tasks in NLP are machine translation, text classification and text generation. Deep learning has been widely applied to solve real-world NLP problems. This section presents the recent advancements in deep learning models that have been designed for NLP over the past few years.4.3.1 Text ClassificationText classification known as text categorization, is a task that involves assigning predefined categories or labels to a piece of text based on its content. The task is commonly used in various applications such as document classification, sentiment analysis

[3]: Passage ID 3: Knowledge Sources, Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural-based Techniques, Evaluation Scores1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with text understanding and text generation. The former subject is studied in the sub-branch natural language understanding (NLU) 1; 2; 3 and the latter in natural language generation (NLG) 4; 5. Over the years, both fields, i.e., NLU and NLG developed enormously with an extensive literature which requires nowadays a dedicated discussion of specialized subtasks when presenting approaches or methods thereof despite the fact that a systems understanding of NLP can only be achieved holistically.In this paper, we focus on subtasks of NLP centered around question answering (QA). The task of a QA system is to find an answer (output) in the form of a natural language for a given question (input) usually presented in form of a sentence. While our focus is on QA systems and their

[5]: Passage ID 5: second concern is the black-box nature of modern NLP models. We do not encourage decision-making systems to depend fully on NLP, but suggest that NLP can assist human decision-makers. Hence, all the applications introduced in this chapter use NLP to compile information that is necessary for policymaking instead of directly suggesting a policy. Nonetheless, some of the models are hard to interpret or explain, such as text classification using deep learning models (Yin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), which could be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by small paraphrasing of the text input (Jin et al., 2020). In practical applications, it is important to ensure the trustworthiness of the usage of AI. There could be a preference for transparent machine learning models if they can do the work well (e.g., LDA topic models, and traditional classification methods using dictionaries or linguistic rules), or tasks with well-controlled outputs such as event extraction to select spans of the
