## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information to accurately distinguish between loan translation and transfer in linguistics, nor does it include specific examples of these phenomena. The passages focus on issues related to natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and the challenges associated with low-resource languages and orthography, but they do not discuss loan translation or transfer as distinct linguistic concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide a clear and precise answer to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: lack sufficient data for NLP applications (Joshi et al. 2020; Blasi, Anastasopoulos, and Neubig 2022; Ranathunga and de Silva 2022).Cross-lingual transfer offers a solution to this issue, as models trained on resource-rich languages can be applied to low-resource languages (Conneau et al. 2020; Hu et al. 2020).While some studies suggest that cross-lingual transfer is more effective within the same language families, other work points to sub-word evenness (SuE) as a more critical factor in successful transfer (Pelloni, Shaitarova, and Samardzic 2022).Furthermore, transferring knowledge to languages with unknown scripts has proven exceedingly difficult (Anastasopoulos and Neubig 2019), prompting exploration of transliteration to mitigate script-related challenges (Hermjakob, May, and Knight 2018; Murikinati, Anastasopoulos, and Neubig 2020).The implications of cross-lingual and cross-script transfer for LLM security warrant further investigation.Language ConfusionLanguage

[2]:  Passage ID 2: orthographic information, focusing on multilingual settings and bilingual lexicon induction.Keywords: Orthography, Under-resourced languages, Machine translation, Rule-based machine translation, Statistical machine translation, Neural machine translation††journal: Machine Translation Journal1 IntroductionNatural Language Processing (NLP) plays a significant role in keeping languages alive and the development of languages in the digital device era (Karakanta et al., 2018). One of the sub-parts of NLP is Machine Translation (MT). MT has been the most promising application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) since the invention of computers, which has has been shown to increase access to information by the native language of the speakers in many cases. One of the such critical case is the spread of vital information during a crisis or emergency (Lewis et al., 2011; Neubig and Hu, 2018). Recently, translation accuracy has increased, and commercial systems have gained popularity.
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: such as explicitation and implications from Finish to English without ideological motivations (Puurtinen, 2003). Apart from traditional analyses, the methods of using machine learning and deep learning models also reveal some traits of translationese. Some potential factors include n-grams, word form, lemma, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and elements mixed as features input into support vector machines (SVMs) (Baroni, 2006). The study shows that the distinctive contrast between the translated and original texts is primarily affected by function words and POS n-grams. Ilisei et al.’s (2010) study suggests that the most relevant features that distinguish translations from untranslated texts are lexical richness, the proportion of grammatical words to lexical words, sentence length, word length, and some morphological attributes like nouns, pronouns, finite verbs, conjunctions, and prepositions by using a supervised learning technique. Two lexical features, namely high-frequency words
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: lexicographic purposes and for NLP downstream tasks such as parsing (Alex, 2008a), text-to-speech synthesis (Leidig et al., 2014), and machine translation (Tsvetkov and Dyer, 2016).Recent work has approached the problem of extracting lexical borrowings in European languages such as German (Alex, 2008b; Garley and Hockenmaier, 2012; Leidig et al., 2014), Italian (Furiassi and Hofland, 2007), French (Alex, 2008a; Chesley, 2010), Finnish (Mansikkaniemi and Kurimo, 2012), Norwegian (Andersen, 2012; Losnegaard and Lyse, 2012), and Spanish (Serigos, 2017), with a particular focus on English lexical borrowings (often called anglicisms).Computational approaches to mixed-language data have traditionally framed the task of identifying the language of a word as a tagging problem, where every word in the sequence receives a language tag (Lignos and Marcus, 2013; Molina et al., 2016; Solorio et al., 2014).As lexical borrowings can be single (e.g. app, online, smartphone) or multi-token (e.g.
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: applications of natural language processing which has been explored in different languages. Recently researchers started paying attention towards machine translation for resource-poor languages and closely related languages. A widespread and underlying problem for these machine translation systems is the variation in orthographic conventions which causes many issues to traditional approaches. Two languages written in two different orthographies are not easily comparable, but orthographic information can also be used to improve the machine translation system. This article offers a survey of research regarding orthography’s influence on machine translation of under-resourced languages. It introduces under-resourced languages in terms of machine translation and how orthographic information can be utilised to improve machine translation. We describe previous work in this area, discussing what underlying assumptions were made, and showing how orthographic knowledge improves the performance
