## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Causation in text is categorized based on the presence of causal signals and keywords, which help identify explicit and implicit causal relations. The study of causal text mining often focuses on extracting this information to build a knowledge base, summarize data, or support predictions. Key methodologies and datasets have been developed to assist in this categorization.

One primary mechanism for categorizing causation is through the identification of specific lexical cues or connectives that indicate causal relations. For instance, the AltLex dataset investigates causal relations using alternative lexicalizations of causal connectives in single sentences. This includes phrases and linguistic constructions, such as "so (close) that," which signal causality [5]. However, it's noted that the AltLex dataset is limited in size and does not adequately capture all aspects of causal signaling, such as implicit causation and inter-sentence relations [5].

Additionally, recent works air towards more sophisticated extraction methods. Research has identified conditional statements in texts, particularly in medical guidelines, by utilizing rule-based approaches that focus on conjunctions such as "if" [2]. This highlights how specific keywords facilitate the extraction of conditional relationships, allowing for a classification of sentences into cause and effect.

The study of event causality identification (ECI) further pushes this categorization. In such studies, researchers analyze the relationships between event mentions, identifying how certain events lead to other consequences. This approach focuses on the systematization of events and their causal connections which are often denoted by specific language structures [4]. 

Moreover, datasets like e-CARE and Headline Cause also play significant roles in categorizing causation by providing structured environments in which implicit causal relations can be identified and assessed. For example, the eCARE dataset incorporates cause, effect, and explanations to support the comprehensive understanding of causal mechanisms in text [2]. 

Overall, causation is categorized in text through the identification of causal signals and keywords, using approaches that range from simple lexical analyses to complex event-driven methodologies. This layered methodology is crucial to enhance the robustness of automated systems aimed at understanding human language and its embedded causal information [1] [2] [4]. The ongoing development of datasets and techniques underscores the importance of a well-rounded approach in causal text mining to address existing challenges, such as data deficiency and the meticulous nature of cause-effect relationships in different contexts [5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: causal text mining causal relation extraction1 IntroductionCausal text mining relates to the extraction of causal information from text. Given an input text, we are interested to know if and where causal information occurs. Researchers can use extracted causal information as a knowledge base [9, 16, 15], for summarization, or prediction [24]. Since causality is an important part of human cognition, causal text mining has important natural language understanding applications [8, 29, 6]. Figure 1 illustrates three causal text mining tasks (Sequence Classification, Span Detection and Pair Classification) and their expected output.Figure 1: A two-sentence example that contains causal relations. (I) Sequence Classification aims to return a Causal label. (II) Span Detection identifies the text related to the Cause-Effect spans. This example contains three annotated relation pairs, where two are labeled Causal and one is labeled Non-causal. These are target labels of the (III) Pair

On COPA, ChatGPT in-context learning got a 97% accuracy (performance); on the eCARE dataset, a 79.6% accuracy was obtained using prompt engineering, and 72.7% accuracy was recorded for on Headline Cause.2.3. Causality extraction from the medical textIn 2013 the task of automatic detection conditional statements in medical guidelines was first introduced (Wenzina and Kaiser, 2013). The article used a rule-based approach, focusing on presence of connectives such as ”if”, and a collection of word-based syntactic patterns. Subsequent works on detecting condition action statements from CPGs, (Hematialam and Zadrozny, 2017) and (Hematialam, 2021), apply supervised machine learning techniques to classify sentences according to

Recent work on causality extraction from non-medical textThe study by (Li et al., 2021) directly extracts cause and effect from text without separately extracting candidate pairs and their relations. A work on event extraction (Man et al., 2022) focuses on identifying the causal relationship between pairs of event mentions, also known as ’Event Causality Identification’ (ECI). Balashankar et al. (Balashankar et al., 2019) propose an event extraction (modality) that seeks to uncover the hidden relationships between events mentioned in news streams by creating a Predictive Causal Graph (PCG). Prompt tuning has been proposed to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning on many of the mainstream NLP tasks like text classification(Schick and Schütze, 2020; Zhang et al., 2021), information extraction(Chen

The lack of standardized datasets hinders comparisons in performance across models [1]. In the next few paragraphs, we describe some common causal text mining datasets.AltLex [11]222https://github.com/chridey/altlex investigates causal relations with alternative lexicalizations (AltLex) connectives in single sentences. AltLex connectives are an open-class of markers with varied linguistic constructions [33], like “so (close) that” and “This may help explain why”. The limitations of the AltLex dataset is that it (1) is small in size, (2) ignores explicit and implicit signals in causal relations, (3) ignores inter-sentence causal relations, and (4) assumes Cause and Effect spans to be all the words before and after the signals.BECAUSE 2.0 [7]333https://github.com/duncanka/BECAUSE/tree/2.0 contains annotations for causal language in single sentences.
