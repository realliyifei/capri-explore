## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not specifically address how causation is categorized in text based on causal signals and keywords. While it discusses various aspects of natural language processing (NLP) and text classification, it lacks information regarding causal relationships, signals, and keywords in textual data. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given passages.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: Researchers should explore techniques to explain the predictions of models, to improve trust and understanding of model decisions, which is essential for adoption in finance.4.3 Natural Language ProcessingNatural language processing (NLP) refers to the field of artificial intelligence that concerns with enabling computers to process, analyze and interpret human languages to extract useful information. Some of the common tasks in NLP are machine translation, text classification and text generation. Deep learning has been widely applied to solve real-world NLP problems. This section presents the recent advancements in deep learning models that have been designed for NLP over the past few years.4.3.1 Text ClassificationText classification known as text categorization, is a task that involves assigning predefined categories or labels to a piece of text based on its content. The task is commonly used in various applications such as document classification, sentiment analysis

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: analysis by conceptual primitives from text and linked with commonsense concepts and named entities.Recent studies have used these contextual and transformer-based LMs in their model in various NLP tasks. Furthermore, various studies have been presented which use the domain-specific LMs for different NLP tasks. These hybrid and domain-specific LMs have improved the performance and ability to capture complex word attributes, such as semantics, OOV, context, and syntax, into account in various NLP task.4. Classification techniquesChoosing an appropriate classifier is one of the main steps in the text classification task. Without having a comprehensive knowledge of every algorithm, we cannot find out the most effective model for the text classification task. Out of many ML algorithms used in text classification, we will present some famous and commonly used classification algorithms. These are used for sentiment classification tasks such as Naïve Bayes (NB), Support vector

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: user can ask: Which text processing task does this technique support? What are the alternative techniques for the same task? From Table IV, the user can ask: What level of language analysis does this technique provide? What are the techniques for performing other levels of analysis? The answers to these questions can help the user to decide if a specific technique is relevant to the task at hand.Our future work will improve this knowledge base as follows:•To show the relationship between a given technique and other techniques. For example, for text normalization, what techniques can I use together? in what order? For text representation, which technique is better for my case?•To provide information on the available NLP tools that support each technique.References[1]K. Ryan, “The role of natural language in requirements engineering,” in[1993] Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on RequirementsEngineering.   IEEE, 1993,
