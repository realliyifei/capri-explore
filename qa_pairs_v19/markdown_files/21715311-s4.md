## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any specific information regarding threshold values, precision, recall, or evaluations related to automatically-constructed Persian WordNets. The passages focus on various NLP-related research questions, projects involving question generation and classification methods, and some information about neural network models, but there is no mention of the particular evaluation metrics or methods relevant to your question. As such, the context is insufficient to provide a coherent and accurate answer regarding the influence of threshold values on precision and recall in that specific area of NLP.

[3]: Passage ID 3: ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the laws of thermodynamics?” Following a quality inspection of the synthetically produced questions, we assembled a training dataset of 1601 examples, consisting of 120 questions for each of the 12 topics and 161 general questions. We also derived a test dataset containing 364 examples with a balanced class distribution similar to the training dataset.In our experiments, we evaluated three classification approaches: vector similarity search, prompting a LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), and few-shot fine-tuning of a transformer model with the SetFit framework Tunstall et al. (2022). Concerning the vector search approach with the SPECTER2 model, we measured the cosine similarity to compare vectors of embedded user queries with paper embeddings in our vector database to retrieve the 100 most similar
[4]: Passage ID 4: in NLP, I outline the following toy examples.1.1.1 Example 1Suppose BERT ([20]) is fine-tuned on the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA; [79]). CoLA is a binary classification task, where the model judges whether an input sentence is grammatical or not.BERT has been pre-trained on a large document-level corpus on two self-supervised tasks: a masked language modelling task and a next sentence prediction task. For the fine-tuning stage, a linear classifier is appended to the end of the model. The classifier takes in the activation above the first token from BERT’s final layer and predicts a probability distribution over labels C={grammatical,ungrammatical}𝐶grammaticalungrammaticalC=\{\texttt{grammatical},\texttt{ungrammatical}\}. The combination of model and classifier are tuned (a supervised task) on the labelled training portion of CoLA.Suppose that at test time BERT incorrectly judges the following CoLA example as ungrammatical:John danced waltzes across the
[5]: Passage ID 5: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
