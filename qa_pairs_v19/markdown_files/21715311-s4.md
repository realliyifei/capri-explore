## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The threshold values in systems evaluating automatically-constructed Persian WordNets significantly influence precision and recall. Precision refers to the accuracy of the extracted information (i.e., the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions), while recall measures the ability of the system to identify all relevant instances (i.e., the proportion of true positives among actual positive instances).

In the context of knowledge extraction, when a system calculates triples or units of information, it operates based on a confidence threshold. A higher confidence threshold increases precision; that is, the system only accepts triples that have a high likelihood of being correct. This method ensures that what is included in the Persian WordNet is more likely to be accurate; for instance, the approach utilized in the construction of the Persian WordNet was based on a precision of 91.18%, ensuring a reliable output comprising over 16,000 words and 22,000 synsets [1][3].

Conversely, if the threshold is lowered, the system can potentially improve recall. This means that it may include more triples, capturing more relevant information that it might otherwise miss if it were solely relying on a stricter confidence criterion. However, this enhancement comes at a cost; as the recall increases, the precision may decrease. A person tasked with reviewing these triples may find themselves with excessive incorrect entries to verify, altering their role from a verifier to an annotator [2]. This overshooting can lead to a greater burden on human experts involved in quality assurance, reducing the overall motivation for them to engage with the system [2].

Thus, there is a trade-off between precision and recall based on the threshold settings. A careful balance needs to be struck: if the threshold is set too high, precision will be favored but recall will suffer due to missed instances; if it is set too low, unintended incorrect entries may overwhelm the verification process, affecting the quality of the constructed WordNet [2].

In summary, the manipulation of threshold values in verifying and constructing Persian WordNets plays a critical role in determining the balance between precision and recall, impacting both the performance of the system and the workflow of human validators. Operators must consider these dynamics when designing automated systems to ensure optimal outcomes.

Using a Persian corpus and a bi-lingual dictionary, the initial links between Persian words and Princeton WordNet synsets have been generated. These links will be discriminated later as correct or incorrect by employing seven features in a trained classification system. The whole method is just a classification system, which has been trained on a train set containing FarsNet as a set of correct instances. State of the art results on the automatically derived Persian wordnet is achieved. The resulted wordnet with a precision of 91.18% includes more than 16,000 words and 22,000 synsets.

Therefore, the precision metric has the highest importance during the entire extraction process. Human intervention in a web-scale system, such as our proposed system, as well as other web-sclase machine reading systems, is for verification, not to create a supervised system. In this case, some human users are asked to review and accept or reject the triples which the system has calculated relatively high confidence for them. We can reduce the confidence threshold, and as a result, the recall will reach much higher results. However, this dramatically increases the number of triples that should be examined by human users and changes their function from a verifier to an annotator. Because human verifiers help the system voluntarily, providing such a volume of incorrect triplets for them to verify, will exhaust their motivation to continue doing so. In other words, we want human

5.

It also includes much of the broader field of NLP that deals with predicting or modeling sequences of natural language in some way. Work in NLP intentionally leveraging natural language supervision in the form of explanations, feedback, instructions, and advice for tasks such as classification (as opposed to the commonly used representation of supervision as a set of arbitrarily encoded discrete category labels) has been explored in many creative and advanced ways. Dialog based learning (Weston, 2016; Li et al., 2016; Hancock et al., 2019) develops techniques to learn from interactive natural language feedback in dialog. Several papers have leveraged semantic parsing to convert natural language explanations
