## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not include specific information about the training objective of Auto-regressive Modelling (AM), its limitations, or potential solutions. It primarily discusses the capabilities and challenges of large language models (LLMs) and their applications, rather than detailing specific model architectures or training objectives. The relevant passages focus on the general understanding and applications of LLMs, the history of NLP, and the societal implications of these technologies, but they do not elaborate on Auto-regressive Modelling specifically. Therefore, the context is insufficient to fully address the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: for Large Language Models: A SurveySourav VermaIBM Watsonx Client Engineering, Indiasourav.verma@ibm.com | souravv.vermaa@gmail.com1 IntroductionThe pioneering accomplishments of large language models (LLMs) have galvanized research initiatives across both industrial and academic spheres. These LLMs showcase their capacity to converse with humans in a natural and articulate manner, excelling across various tasks such as document summarization, Q&A systems, conversational AI, and coding assistants. Despite their advancements, LLMs continue to struggle with tasks that require specialized knowledge or domain-specific expertise. Kandpal et al. (2023). Notably, they may produce “hallucinations” Zhang et al. (2023) when confronted with out-of-scope queries or requests that necessitate up-to-date knowledge. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages external knowledge bases to retrieve relevant document snippets, utilizing semantic

Our research can help businesses and policymakers make informed decisions about deploying these models, ensuring they are used ethically and effectively. This, in turn, can lead to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems, fostering greater public trust and acceptance.Appendix C Related WorkUnderstanding LLMs’ capabilities from training dataBecause of the scale of the data and model sizes, most work on understanding LLMs attempts to examine how LLMs gain their capabilities from synthetic experiments or on a small scale Arora and Goyal [2023].Prystawski et al. [2023] and Wang et al. [2024] discuss how the reasoning ability of language models is a consequence of their pretraining data. Prystawski et al.

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: to the user.Until very recently, AI systems were focused on specific tasks, such as Question Answering, Description Generation, or Text Summarization. However, LLMs are trained over tons of information, making it possible for a single NLG system to address many applications, i.e., following a one-fits-all approach. This is the case, for instance, of ChatGPT, which was originally conceived as a chatbot, although it now provides solutions in natural language to a wide range of prompts (open questions, poetry generation, summaries, etc.). The popularity of these NLG tools, partly because of their versatility in the variety of tasks they solve, has placed AI research on the radar, in particular NLP.Indeed, great advances have been made in NLP tasks thanks to neural models and the aforementioned LLMs (as machine translation, text classification, and text generation). The progress has been so great that some of these tasks can now be considered solved. The question arises as to how
