## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information regarding shell nouns or their relationship with shell content. It focuses predominantly on natural language processing (NLP), its subbranches such as natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG), and various model and method developments within those fields, particularly concerning question answering systems. Since the topic of shell nouns is not mentioned in any of the provided passages, there is insufficient information to accurately respond to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the

In this paper, we review significant deep learning related models and methods that have been employed for numerous NLP tasks and provide a walk-through of their evolution. We also summarize, compare and contrast the various models and put forward a detailed understanding of the past, present and future of deep learning in NLP.Index Terms: Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Word2Vec, Attention, Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTM, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering, Dialogue Systems, Parsing, Named-Entity Recognition, POS Tagging, Semantic Role LabelingI IntroductionNatural language processing(NLP) is a theory-motivatedrange of computational techniquesfor the automatic analysis andrepresentation of human language.NLP research has evolved from the eraof punch
