## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Self-supervised models significantly enhance automatic pronunciation assessment by leveraging phonetic and prosodic information through novel training techniques that facilitate improved predictions of fluency and prosodic scores. The approach detailed in the context employs a multi-step process that involves both pre-training on unlabeled data and subsequent fine-tuning on limited labeled datasets.

Initially, self-supervised models utilize a technique known as masked prediction. In the study highlighted, a large volume of non-native speech and corresponding text prompts is used to mask 15% of phone-level features—this includes phonetic units and duration information. The model is trained to reconstruct these masked features through joint prediction, which enhances its representation of long-range phonetic and prosodic context [1] [2]. By using a reconstruction loss function during the pre-training phase, the model learns to better understand and predict the underlying patterns in the speech data, thereby improving its fluency scoring capability.

The experimental outcomes demonstrate that this self-supervised learning method not only provides a robust foundation for understanding how speech is produced but also outperforms traditional baseline systems in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC), indicating a higher accuracy in predicting fluency scores [2]. Such metrics serve as crucial benchmarks for assessing the effectiveness of models in the context of language proficiency evaluation. 

Furthermore, the incorporation of phonetic and prosodic factors during both the pre-training and fine-tuning phases allows the model to be more sensitive to the nuances of fluent speech production—characterized by minimal pauses and seamless delivery [3]. The detailed analysis of different loss functions in an ablation study also sheds light on the contribution of various training strategies and features, further refining how fluency can be quantitatively assessed.

Additionally, the research indicates that future explorations aim to investigate the scoring of fluency at different levels of granularity. This includes assessments at the phone and word levels, as well as analyzing fluency related to aspects such as accuracy and proficiency [3]. By examining these finer distinctions, self-supervised models can provide more tailored assessments that better reflect a learner's linguistic capabilities.

In summary, self-supervised models advance the field of automatic pronunciation assessment by employing innovative training methods that harness both phonetic and prosodic cues, ultimately enhancing the prediction accuracy of fluency and prosodic scores in non-native speakers' assessments [1] [2] [3].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that incorporates phonetic and prosodic information to improve non-native fluency scoring. The pre-trained model is used to predict masked phones and durations, which enhances the model's ability to represent long-range phonetic and prosodic information. Specifically, we use an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to generate phone-level raw sequential features, e.g. acoustic features, phone sequences, and duration, for pairs of non-native speech and prompt text. We then randomly mask 15% of these phone-level features and train our fluency scorer to predict the masked phone and duration. Finally, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using limited human-annotated fluency scores. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve fluency scoring in various configurations. An ablation study is also conducted to analyze the effect of different loss functions used in our pre-training stage on

Specifically, we first pre-train the model using a reconstruction loss function, by masking phones and their durations jointly on a large amount of unlabeled speech and text prompts. We then fine-tune the pre-trained model using human-annotated scoring data. Our experimental results, conducted on datasets such as Speechocean762 and our non-native datasets, show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline systems in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC). Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study to better understand the contribution of phonetic and prosody factors during the pre-training stage.Index Terms: Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT), Non-native Fluency Scoring, Phonetic and Prosody-aware, Self-suprevised Learning1 IntroductionThe ability to speak fluently is a significant aspect when evaluating a learner's language proficiency [1].

The method involves masking the phone and duration of input features and then reconstructing them by utilizing a vast amount of unlabeled non-native data during the pre-training phase. To predict the fluency score, a small amount of scoring data was utilized to fine-tune the pre-trained model. Results based on the Speechocean762 datasets and our non-native dataset indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline systems. Our future research aims to explore the benefits of our approach for scoring at various levels (such as phone, and word) and granularities (such as accuracy, and proficiency). Additionally, we plan to explore the impact of using the L1 dataset when pre-training.References[1]A. Housen and F. Kuiken, ``Complexity, accuracy, and fluency in second languageacquisition,''
