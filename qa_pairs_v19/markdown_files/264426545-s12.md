## Answer

## I don't know?: False

Self-supervised models play a crucial role in predicting fluency and prosodic scores in automatic pronunciation assessment by effectively leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled speech data, which allows for the extraction and utilization of phonetic and prosodic features. These models are trained to predict masked features, such as phones and durations, which enhances their representation of long-range phonetic and prosodic information — a vital aspect for assessing non-native fluency accurately.

The proposed self-supervised learning approach incorporates phonetic and prosodic information by first masking 15% of phone-level features, including acoustic features, phoneme sequences, and duration information from both non-native speech and corresponding prompt text [1]. This is followed by training the model to reconstruct these features, which helps in creating a deeper understanding of the intricacies of speech [2]. By utilizing an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, the model generates detailed sequential features, setting a solid foundation for performance in fluency scoring [1].

After this pre-training phase, the model transitions to a fine-tuning stage using a smaller set of human-annotated fluency scores. This dual-phase training allows the model to first learn generalized speech patterns before being tailored to specific fluency assessments, ultimately leading to significant improvements in fluency scoring across different configurations and datasets, such as Speechocean762 [1] [3]. The combination of a reconstruction loss function and phonetic/prosodic inputs results in a model that outperforms baseline systems in measuring Pearson correlation coefficients, demonstrating its effectiveness in fluency metrics [2].

Furthermore, the ability of self-supervised models to process and analyze phonetic and prosodic data facilitates a granular approach to fluency predictions. Future research aims to dissect these contributions further by evaluating the impact of different scoring levels (e.g., phoneme and word) and by exploring additional datasets (such as L1) in pre-training strategies [3]. This adaptability of self-supervised learning in NLP is not merely about performance but also opens avenues for enhanced user interaction and feedback in applications related to language learning and pronunciation assessment.

In summary, self-supervised models contribute to predicting fluency and prosodic scores in automatic pronunciation assessment by effectively utilizing unlabeled speech data, employing innovative masking strategies, and demonstrating superior performance through rigorous training techniques. This methodology not only ensures a comprehensive understanding of phonetic and prosodic cues but also facilitates ongoing advancements in the realm of language proficiency evaluation.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that incorporates phonetic and prosodic information to improve non-native fluency scoring. The pre-trained model is used to predict masked phones and durations, which enhances the model's ability to represent long-range phonetic and prosodic information. Specifically, we use an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to generate phone-level raw sequential features, e.g. acoustic features, phone sequences, and duration, for pairs of non-native speech and prompt text. We then randomly mask 15% of these phone-level features and train our fluency scorer to predict the masked phone and duration. Finally, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using limited human-annotated fluency scores. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve fluency scoring in various configurations. An ablation study is also conducted to analyze the effect of different loss functions used in our pre-training stage on

Specifically, we first pre-train the model using a reconstruction loss function, by masking phones and their durations jointly on a large amount of unlabeled speech and text prompts. We then fine-tune the pre-trained model using human-annotated scoring data. Our experimental results, conducted on datasets such as Speechocean762 and our non-native datasets, show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline systems in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC). Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study to better understand the contribution of phonetic and prosody factors during the pre-training stage.Index Terms: Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT), Non-native Fluency Scoring, Phonetic and Prosody-aware, Self-suprevised Learning1 IntroductionThe ability to speak fluently is a significant aspect when evaluating a learner's language proficiency [1].

The method involves masking the phone and duration of input features and then reconstructing them by utilizing a vast amount of unlabeled non-native data during the pre-training phase. To predict the fluency score, a small amount of scoring data was utilized to fine-tune the pre-trained model. Results based on the Speechocean762 datasets and our non-native dataset indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline systems. Our future research aims to explore the benefits of our approach for scoring at various levels (such as phone, and word) and granularities (such as accuracy, and proficiency). Additionally, we plan to explore the impact of using the L1 dataset when pre-training.References[1]A. Housen and F. Kuiken, ``Complexity, accuracy, and fluency in second languageacquisition,''
