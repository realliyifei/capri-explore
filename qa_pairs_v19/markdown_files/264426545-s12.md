## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Self-supervised models significantly enhance the prediction of fluency and prosodic scores in automatic pronunciation assessment by leveraging phonetic and prosodic information, which is crucial for evaluating non-native speech. This approach combines a pre-training phase that utilizes a vast amount of unlabeled data with a fine-tuning phase that employs a limited set of human-annotated scoring data. 

The core idea of the method is to apply a self-supervised learning approach that involves masking certain features of the speech data, specifically phones (the distinct units of sound) and their durations. During the pre-training phase, the model is trained to reconstruct these masked features using large datasets of non-native speech paired with prompt text. This technique allows the model to learn to predict masked phones and durations, effectively enhancing its representation of long-range phonetic and prosodic information, which is essential for assessing fluency [1][2].

In practice, the model is first pre-trained using a reconstruction loss function, where it masks a significant percentage of phone-level features (15% as noted) during training on unlabeled data [1][2]. This phase allows the model to develop a foundational understanding of the characteristics of fluent speech. Once this pre-training is completed, the model is then fine-tuned on a smaller set of annotated scores from human evaluators, which tailors its predictions to more closely match human evaluations of fluency [2][3].

Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. For instance, evaluations using datasets such as Speechocean762 highlight that the self-supervised model not only outperforms baseline systems in predicting fluency but also achieves significant correlations with human-annotated scores, indicating its robustness and reliability [2][3]. The introduction of phonetic and prosodic factors during the model's training is key to its performance, addressing limitations commonly faced by deep learning models in this realm, particularly the scarcity of labeled training samples [5].

Moreover, the ability of self-supervised learning to utilize unannotated data represents a substantial advantage. Many traditional models rely heavily on annotated datasets, which are often limited, thereby constraining their effectiveness [5]. By incorporating a broader array of unlabeled data, the self-supervised approach can create more generalized and nuanced fluency predictors, capable of adapting to various assessment contexts, such as different languages or dialectal variations.

In conclusion, self-supervised models contribute to predicting fluency and prosodic scores by integrating phonetic and prosodic information into a learning framework that efficiently utilizes both unlabeled and labeled datasets, ultimately enhancing the assessment of non-native pronunciation [1][2][3]. The experimental success of this approach showcases its potential for advancing tools in Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) and beyond.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that incorporates phonetic and prosodic information to improve non-native fluency scoring. The pre-trained model is used to predict masked phones and durations, which enhances the model's ability to represent long-range phonetic and prosodic information. Specifically, we use an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to generate phone-level raw sequential features, e.g. acoustic features, phone sequences, and duration, for pairs of non-native speech and prompt text. We then randomly mask 15% of these phone-level features and train our fluency scorer to predict the masked phone and duration. Finally, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using limited human-annotated fluency scores. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve fluency scoring in various configurations. An ablation study is also conducted to analyze the effect of different loss functions used in our pre-training stage on

Specifically, we first pre-train the model using a reconstruction loss function, by masking phones and their durations jointly on a large amount of unlabeled speech and text prompts. We then fine-tune the pre-trained model using human-annotated scoring data. Our experimental results, conducted on datasets such as Speechocean762 and our non-native datasets, show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline systems in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC). Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study to better understand the contribution of phonetic and prosody factors during the pre-training stage.Index Terms: Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT), Non-native Fluency Scoring, Phonetic and Prosody-aware, Self-suprevised Learning1 IntroductionThe ability to speak fluently is a significant aspect when evaluating a learner's language proficiency [1].

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: in fluency scoring.6 ConclusionThis article introduces a self-supervised learning technique that is phonetic and prosody-aware for assessing the fluency of L2 learners' speech. The method involves masking the phone and duration of input features and then reconstructing them by utilizing a vast amount of unlabeled non-native data during the pre-training phase. To predict the fluency score, a small amount of scoring data was utilized to fine-tune the pre-trained model. Results based on the Speechocean762 datasets and our non-native dataset indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline systems. Our future research aims to explore the benefits of our approach for scoring at various levels (such as phone, and word) and granularities (such as accuracy, and proficiency). Additionally, we plan to explore the impact of using the L1 dataset when pre-training.References[1]A. Housen and F. Kuiken, ``Complexity, accuracy, and fluency in second languageacquisition,''

Deep neural networks are commonly trained to map fluency-related features into the human scores. However, the effectiveness of deep learning-based models is constrained by the limited amount of labeled training samples.
