## Answer

The context provided does not explicitly delineate the primary categories and methods for assessing prompt performance in in-context learning (ICL). However, it does offer insights into some related aspects of prompt design and its impact on model performance.

One of the key points derived from the context is the distinction between different types of prompts that can affect the performance of large language models (LLMs) in ICL. The content of a prompt can encompass various elements such as instructions, questions, multiple demonstrations, specific output formats, and additional requirements that may entail complex reasoning processes or role-playing commands. This diversity and detail in prompts are important for achieving desired model responses [1][2]. 

Another important finding related to prompt performance is that studies have highlighted the varying effects of prompt components on model performance. Some studies, such as those by Webson and Pavlick (2021), indicate that both relevant and irrelevant instructions in prompts can yield similar performance outcomes, suggesting that the impact of specific prompt details may not be straightforward. Conversely, Mishra et al. (2021b) and Reynolds and McDonell (2021) argue that detailed, task-relevant prompts that closely resemble natural language significantly enhance model performance [4]. This indicates that assessing prompt performance may involve analyzing the relationship between prompt content and model responsiveness.

Moreover, the context hints at methods for efficient prompting. Two primary approaches for efficient prompting are identified: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former relates to methods for compressing prompts, while the latter involves techniques for optimizing prompts automatically. Understanding these approaches contributes to assessing how effectively prompts utilize computational resources and design principles to achieve optimal model performance [5].

However, while these insights provide a starting point for understanding prompt performance in ICL, the context lacks specific methodologies or concrete frameworks that categorize and formally assess prompt performance. The focus is primarily on the relationship between prompt complexity and model output quality, rather than a structured assessment schema.

In summary, while there are insights offered on the importance of prompt design and the emerging classifications of efficient prompting methods, the context does not provide a structured answer detailing primary categories and methods specifically for assessing prompt performance in ICL. Thus, a precise answer to your question about the primary categories and methods used for assessment cannot be provided based solely on the given context. Therefore, I must conclude that I do not know the answer to your question.

Prompting is an important medium for human-computer interaction to explicitly deliver clear task descriptions to LLMs, which then generate user-desired responses through analogical learning. The content of a prompt can vary across different contexts, specifically containing instructions, questions, multiple demonstrations with specific output formats, and additional requirements like complex reasoning processes and role-playing commands. In this paper, the term prompt refers to the user input to LLMs.However, as the in-context learning (ICL) (Dong et al., 2022) ability of LLMs becomes more powerful, prompts designed for different specific tasks tend to be diverse and detailed.

[3]: Passage ID 3: Language Models. To our surprise, we find that prompting-based approaches outperform controllable text generation methods on most datasets and tasks, highlighting a need for research on controllable text generation with Instruction-tuned Language Models in specific. Prompt-based approaches match human performance on most stylistic tasks while lagging on structural tasks, foregrounding a need to study more varied constraints and more challenging stylistic tasks. To facilitate such research, we provide an algorithm that uses only a task dataset and a Large Language Model with in-context capabilities to automatically generate a constraint dataset. This method eliminates the fields dependence on pre-curated constraint datasets, hence vastly expanding the range of constraints that can be studied in the future.1 IntroductionRecent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Jones, 1994; Chowdhary & Chowdhary, 2020) have highlighted emergent capabilities of Large Language Models

(2021b) and Reynolds and McDonell (2021) argued the opposite. The latter studies showed that detailed and task-relevant prompts that closely resemble natural human language give better model performance.Similarly, Kim et al.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.1 IntroductionLarge Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced state-of-the-art on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as dialogue, machine translation, and summarization (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023).
