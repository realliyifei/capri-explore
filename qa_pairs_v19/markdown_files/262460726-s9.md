## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The context provided does not contain explicit information regarding the primary categories and methods for assessing prompt performance specifically in in-context learning (ICL). While the passages discuss prompting, language models' capabilities, and studies that relate to prompt performance and design, none of the passages detail distinct categories or comprehensive methodologies for assessing prompt performance within ICL.

For example, there are references to various studies that analyze the impact of prompt designs on model performance and point out inconsistencies in findings regarding relevant versus irrelevant instructions in prompts [4]. However, specific categories or frameworks for evaluating these prompts are not mentioned.

Additionally, the discussions around efficient prompting methods [5] suggest a general evolution in techniques, but they don't elaborate on structured ways to assess prompt performance nor categorize these evaluation methods. 

Thus, while the passages give insights into prompting and ICL, they do not provide sufficient detail on the primary categories and methods for the assessment of prompt performance in ICL settings. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your question.

Prompting is an important medium for human-computer interaction to explicitly deliver clear task descriptions to LLMs, which then generate user-desired responses through analogical learning. The content of a prompt can vary across different contexts, specifically containing instructions, questions, multiple demonstrations with specific output formats, and additional requirements like complex reasoning processes and role-playing commands. In this paper, the term prompt refers to the user input to LLMs.However, as the in-context learning (ICL) (Dong et al., 2022) ability of LLMs becomes more powerful, prompts designed for different specific tasks tend to be diverse and detailed. Ultra-long natural language prompts gradually raise two issues: 1) for LLM itself, the context window is

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: Language Models. To our surprise, we find that prompting-based approaches outperform controllable text generation methods on most datasets and tasks, highlighting a need for research on controllable text generation with Instruction-tuned Language Models in specific. Prompt-based approaches match human performance on most stylistic tasks while lagging on structural tasks, foregrounding a need to study more varied constraints and more challenging stylistic tasks. To facilitate such research, we provide an algorithm that uses only a task dataset and a Large Language Model with in-context capabilities to automatically generate a constraint dataset. This method eliminates the fields dependence on pre-curated constraint datasets, hence vastly expanding the range of constraints that can be studied in the future.1 IntroductionRecent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Jones, 1994; Chowdhary & Chowdhary, 2020) have highlighted emergent capabilities of Large Language Models
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: prior studies have investigated in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2021; Lialin et al., 2022; Talmor et al., 2020; Webson and Pavlick, 2021; Lampinen et al., 2022; Reynolds and McDonell, 2021; Min et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Raman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023b; Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 2022).However, when it comes to the impact of different parts of the prompt on model performance, the conclusions have often been inconsistent.For example,  Webson and Pavlick (2021) suggest that relevant and irrelevant instructions in the prompt yield similar model performance, whereas Mishra et al. (2021b) and Reynolds and McDonell (2021) argued the opposite. The latter studies showed that detailed and task-relevant prompts that closely resemble natural human language give better model performance.Similarly, Kim et al. (2022) studied the importance of ground-truth labels for in-context learning and found that

[5]:  Passage ID 5: inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.1 IntroductionLarge Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced state-of-the-art on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as dialogue, machine translation, and summarization (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023).
