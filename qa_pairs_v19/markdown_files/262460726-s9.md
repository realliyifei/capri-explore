## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

In assessing prompt performance in in-context learning (ICL) for large language models (LLMs), researchers have identified several categories and methods that can be broadly categorized into manual design evaluation and automated optimization techniques.

1. **Prompt Design**: The initial step in evaluating prompt performance involves crafting prompts that can effectively elicit the desired outcomes from the LLM. Key insights from prior studies indicate that the structure and content of prompts significantly influence model performance. For instance, research has shown that detailed, task-relevant prompts that closely resemble natural human language typically yield better results compared to generic prompts [2]. This aligns with the findings from studies by Reynolds and McDonell (2021) and Mishra et al. (2021), which suggest that relevant aspects of prompts play a critical role in determining effectiveness [2].

2. **Manual Evaluation**: A crucial aspect of prompt performance assessment involves manual evaluations, where researchers analyze prompts based on human interpretations and desired outputs. Given the complexity and variety of tasks LLMs can perform, ensuring that prompts guide the models effectively becomes paramount. This manual approach often emphasizes qualitative aspects and specific task requirements inherent in prompt design [4] [5]. 

3. **Automated Optimization**: Alongside manual evaluations, there are methods focused on automating the prompt design process. This could involve compressing lengthy prompts or employing algorithms to craft optimized prompts automatically [4]. These methods aim to reduce the inference and human effort needed while still maximizing the model's responsiveness and accuracy across diverse NLP tasks [4]. Techniques for efficient prompting can be broadly categorized into those that focus on computation efficiency and those on design efficiency [4].

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: It is also important to consider the evaluation metrics used to assess prompt performance. Due to the absence of a universally "best" prompt, evaluations often depend on multiple metrics, including accuracy, relevance, and task completion rates [5]. This multifaceted approach helps researchers understand prompt effectiveness across different contexts and tasks.

5. **Learning from Examples**: The ICL paradigm fundamentally revolves around presenting the model with input-output pairs—that is, prompts that include examples the model can learn from [3]. This aspect is crucial because it allows models to infer the rules and expectations based on the provided examples, further influencing how prompts should be structured to maximize their performance [3].

In conclusion, evaluating prompt performance in ICL is a nuanced task that requires researchers to balance effective manual design with evolving automated optimization methods. The role of detailed, contextually relevant prompts and the application of rigorous evaluation metrics are essential for harnessing the full potential of LLMs in various NLP tasks [5].

Prompting is an important medium for human-computer interaction to explicitly deliver clear task descriptions to LLMs, which then generate user-desired responses through analogical learning. The content of a prompt can vary across different contexts, specifically containing instructions, questions, multiple demonstrations with specific output formats, and additional requirements like complex reasoning processes and role-playing commands. In this paper, the term prompt refers to the user input to LLMs.However, as the in-context learning (ICL) (Dong et al., 2022) ability of LLMs becomes more powerful, prompts designed for different specific tasks tend to be diverse and detailed. Ultra-long natural language prompts gradually raise two issues: 1) for LLM itself, the context window is
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: prior studies have investigated in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2021; Lialin et al., 2022; Talmor et al., 2020; Webson and Pavlick, 2021; Lampinen et al., 2022; Reynolds and McDonell, 2021; Min et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Raman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023b; Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 2022).However, when it comes to the impact of different parts of the prompt on model performance, the conclusions have often been inconsistent.For example,  Webson and Pavlick (2021) suggest that relevant and irrelevant instructions in the prompt yield similar model performance, whereas Mishra et al. (2021b) and Reynolds and McDonell (2021) argued the opposite. The latter studies showed that detailed and task-relevant prompts that closely resemble natural human language give better model performance.Similarly, Kim et al. (2022) studied the importance of ground-truth labels for in-context learning and found that
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: using annotated data and an LM. Given an input-output pair, we estimate the probability of the output given the input and a candidate training example as the prompt, and label training examples as positive or negative based on this probability. We then train an efficient dense retriever from this data, which is used to retrieve training examples as prompts at test time. We evaluate our approach on three sequence-to-sequence tasks where language utterances are mapped to meaning representations, and find that it substantially outperforms prior work and multiple baselines across the board.1 IntroductionThe striking language skills and world knowledge embedded in large pre-trained language models (LMs) (Devlin et al., 2019; Petroni et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020) have recently led to in-context learning, a new paradigm in natural language understanding. Under this paradigm, a language model isgiven a prompt, which typically contains a few training examples, as

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.1 IntroductionLarge Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced state-of-the-art on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as dialogue, machine translation, and summarization (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023).

We also delve into the challenges faced in evaluating prompt performance, given the absence of a single ”best” prompt and the importance of considering multiple metrics.
