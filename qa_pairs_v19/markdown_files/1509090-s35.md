## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Evaluating parsers that are aware of multiword expressions (MWEs) in syntactic parsing poses several unique challenges. One major difficulty arises from the non-compositional semantics of MWEs, which means that the meaning of these expressions cannot be inferred from their individual components. This non-compositionality complicates the parsing process, as parsers must recognize these expressions as singular units rather than a sequence of separate words [5]. Furthermore, MWEs encompass diverse linguistic forms, including idioms, compound phrases, and light verb constructions, each requiring specific handling in parsing strategies. This variability introduces additional complexity to evaluation metrics, which must fairly assess a parser's ability to identify and process the different types of MWEs [5].

Another significant challenge is the syntactic flexibility of MWEs. Many MWEs can exhibit variable syntactic structures, complicating the task of developing a generalized parsing approach that can effectively handle all variations [3]. Parsing systems must be adaptable to account for these variations while still maintaining accuracy and efficiency, which requires comprehensive training datasets containing richly annotated MWE instances [2].

To address these challenges, solutions have been proposed and explored in the literature. One effective strategy involves enhancing grammatical frameworks to incorporate descriptions of MWEs. For instance, the adaptation of grammar frameworks like FrenchTAG allows for accommodating various syntactic forms of MWEs by introducing interface constraints and new classes tailored to the unique properties of these expressions [3]. This approach helps parsers recognize MWEs as integrated units, thus improving their performance in syntactic parsing tasks.

Recent developments in the field have also focused on fine-tuning neural network models, such as gaBERT and mBERT, specifically for the task of MWE identification. Experiments indicated that such fine-tuning could improve the automatic identification of MWEs, particularly in languages with rich MWE usage like Irish [2]. By using annotated datasets, such as those from shared tasks like PARSEME, researchers can rigorously evaluate the performance of parsing models in correctly identifying and classifying MWEs, providing a benchmark for further improvement [2].

Ultimately, evaluating parsers for MWEs requires a multifaceted approach that combines grammatical enhancements, robust datasets, and advanced modeling techniques to overcome the inherent challenges posed by MWEs in natural language processing [1] [5]. Through ongoing research and development, the effectiveness of syntactic parsers in recognizing and properly analyzing MWEs continues to improve, benefitting a range of NLP applications, especially those concerned with understanding domain-specific texts that heavily utilize technical terminology [1].

Efforts to automate such shallow parsing approaches encountered performance issues when handling \MWEs Zhang and El-Gohary (2019); Zhang and Nora (2020).Although the proper handling of \MWEs is a key issue in \NLPSiskind (1996); Sag et al. (2002); Ramisch et al. (2018), extracting \MWEs is especially relevant to \IEin domains rich in technical terms Baldwin and Kim (2010) – such as the building regulations. Processing \MWEs is a general requirement for \ACC, because both single and multi-word concepts mentioned in regulations have to be aligned with components and values found in \BIM(\BIM) models. Such \BIMmodels rely on standards, such as the \IFC(\IFC) data model, to facilitate amongst others compliance checking
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: of automatically identifying multiword expressions (MWEs) has been explored in the series of shared tasks organised by the PARSEME network [Savary et al., 2017], focusing on verbal MWEs, i.e. MWEs headed by a verb, as they pose a particular challenge in terms of automatic identification.We design an experiment to compare the results of fine-tuning both a gaBERT model and an off-the-shelf mBERT model for the task of identifying MWEs in Irish text. We used the Irish portion of the PARSEME 1.2 shared task data [Walsh et al., 2020], which has been manually annotated with six types of verbal MWEs. The annotations were converted to a modified version of BIO tagging, based on the work of [Schneider et al., 2014], and a linear layer for token classification was added for the task of identifying the correct label for each word.5.   Results5.1.   Development
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: We show how FrenchTAG can be adapted and extended so as to accommodate a small subset of verbal MWEs (VMWEs) of different syntactic structures and of varying degrees of syntactic flexibility. We evaluate the proposal on a dataset based on the PARSEME corpus of VMWEs [Savary et al., forthcoming]. The experiment shows that adding MWE descriptions to a general grammar can be done elegantly by introducing interface constraints in pre-existing classes (to account for restrictive properties), and by adding some new classes (to account for defective properties and for various syntactic structures of lexicalized verbal arguments).The paper is organized as follows. We discuss the state of the art in lexical encoding of MWEs in computational lexicons and grammars (Sec. 2). We introduce our formalisms and tools (Sec. 3). We explain the methodology of making the original metagrammar MWE-aware (Sec. 5). We discuss the evaluation protocol and results (Sec. 6). Finally, we conclude and give

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: which encompass heterogeneous linguistic objects such as idioms (IDs: to pull one’s leg), compounds (a hot dog), light verb constructions (LVCs: to pay a visit), inherently reflexive verbs (IRVs: s’apercevoir ‘selfperceive’⇒⇒\Rightarrow‘realize’ in French), rhetorical figures (as busy as a bee), or named entities (the Sea of Tranquility). Their most pervasive and challenging feature is their non-compositional semantics, i.e. the fact that their meaning cannot be deduced from the meanings of theircomponents, and from their syntactic structures, in a way deemed regular for the given language. For this reason, as well as because of their pervasiveness in texts, MWEs constitute a major challenge in semantically oriented NLP applications.But MWEs also exhibit unexpected behavior on other levels of linguistic analysis including the lexical, morphological and syntactic ones. These properties can be defective or restrictive [Lichte et al., 2018]. A defective property excludes a literal
