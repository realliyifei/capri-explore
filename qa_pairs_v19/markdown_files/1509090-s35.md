## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The provided context does not include specific information about the challenges and solutions in evaluating parsers that are aware of multiword expressions (MWEs) in syntactic parsing. The passages focus on the general issues related to MWEs in natural language processing (NLP), their impact on tasks like machine translation (MT), and the importance of identifying MWEs in various contexts, but they do not explicitly discuss syntactic parsing or the evaluation of parsers. Thus, there is insufficient information to accurately address the question.

Each Subtask includes different settings regarding the amount of training data. Besides the task description, this paper introduces the datasets in English, Portuguese, and Galician and their annotation procedure, the evaluation metrics, and a summary of the participant systems and their results. The task had close to 100 registered participants organised into twenty five teams making over 650 and 150 submissions in the practice and evaluation phases respectively.1 IntroductionMultiword Expressions (MWEs) are a challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as their linguistic behaviour (e.g., syntactic, semantic) differs from that of generic word combinations Baldwin and Kim (2010); Ramisch and Villavicencio (2018).

[3]: Passage ID 3: be done before one can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWEs successfully [12].The study of multiword expressions in NLP has been gaining prominence, and in recent years the number of researchers and projects focusing on them has increased dramatically. The successful computational treatment of MWEs is essential for NLP, including MT and Translation Technology. The inability to detect MWEs automatically may result in incorrect (and even unfortunate) automatic translations and may jeopardise the performance of applications such as text summarisation and web search.Multiword expressions do not only play a crucial role in the computational treatment of natural languages. Often terms are multiword expressions (and not single words), making them highly relevant to terminology. The requirement for correct rendering of MWEs in translation and interpretation highlights their importance in these fields. Given the pervasive nature of MWEs, they play a crucial
[4]: Passage ID 4: Multi-word Expressions (MWEs). MWEs have played a bottleneck in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks including MT. MWEs can be used as one of the main factors to distinguish different MT systems by looking into their capabilities on recognising and translating MWEs in an accurate and meaning equivalent manner.Keywords: Machine Translation Evaluation, Multi-word Expressions, Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation, Fluency and Adequacy, Domain-specific Terminology\newciteslanguageresourceLanguage ResourcesHilMeMe: A Human-in-the-Loop Machine Translation Evaluation Metric Looking into Multi-Word ExpressionsLifeng HanThe University of Manchesterlifeng.han@manchester.ac.ukAbstract content1.   IntroductionMachine Translation Evaluation (MTE) has been a long-term challenging research topic since the development of MT.

We discuss our experiments and results for these two tasks in Section 4, before presenting a discussion of the more interesting elements of our findings in Section 5. We present our conclusions and possible avenues of future work in Section 6.2 Related workThe problems posed by MWEs to NLP models have been known for some time Sag et al. (2002); Constant et al. (2017); Shwartz and Dagan (2019). For instance, Sag et al. (2002) refer to the idiomaticity problem and place the need for effective processing of MWEs on par with that for word sense disambiguation to be able to effectively process text. While their analysis focused on symbolicmethods, this problem still persists:Shwartz and Dagan (2019) showed, using six tasks, that contextual pre-trained language models, capable of handling polysemy, continued to be unable to effectively handle idiomatic MWEs, although they tend to do better than their
