## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Classifier-based approaches to pronunciation assessment utilize both segmental and prosodic features to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of evaluations. 

Segmental features are primarily concerned with the individual sounds (phonemes) that make up speech. In these approaches, classifiers are employed to target specific errors between phoneme pairs, relying on various acoustic features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) along with their first and second derivatives, energy, zero-crossing rates, and spectral features [1]. Techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and decision trees are often used to classify these segmental features, effectively identifying and quantifying pronunciation errors at the phoneme level [1].

On the other hand, prosodic features focus on elements such as intonation, stress, and rhythm, which are crucial for conveying meaning and emotion in speech. Classifiers for prosodic approaches utilize features like energy, pitch, duration, and spectral characteristics to assess and interpret the quality of speech beyond just the phonemes [1]. This might include detecting lexical stress and tones, which can significantly influence whether utterances are understood correctly in context. Classifiers such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are typically utilized in these analyses to handle the complexity of prosodic features [1].

The current challenges in pronunciation assessment arise from a disproportionate emphasis on segmental features, which can lead to discrepancies in feature granularity when evaluating suprasegmental aspects [2]. Effective pronunciation modeling therefore seeks to integrate both types of features, leading to the development of multi-view, multi-granularity approaches that combine segmental assessments with prosodic data for a more comprehensive evaluation [2]. Furthermore, to enhance the effectiveness of these assessments, it is essential to utilize large amounts of labeled speech data, particularly from non-native speakers, as the lack of such data can limit the classifier's performance [2]. 

In summary, classifier-based approaches in pronunciation assessment draw on a combination of segmental and prosodic features, using various acoustic measures and advanced classification techniques to identify and evaluate pronunciation errors comprehensively.

Segmental approaches involve the use of classifiers targeting specific phoneme pair errors, utilizing different acoustic features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) along with its first and second derivative, energy, zero-cross, and spectral features Van Doremalen et al. (2009); Huang et al. (2020), with different techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Truong et al. (2004); Strik et al. (2009), decision trees Strik et al. (2009). Prosodic approaches focus on detecting lexical stress and tones, utilizing features such as energy, pitch, duration, and spectral characteristics, with classifiers like Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)

On one hand, most of the studies focus exclusively on leveraging segmental (phonetic)-level features such as goodness of pronunciation (GOP); this, however, may cause a discrepancy of feature granularity when performing suprasegmental (prosodic)-level pronunciation assessment. On the other hand, automatic pronunciation assessments still suffer from the lack of large-scale labeled speech data of non-native speakers, which inevitably limits the performance of pronunciation assessment. In this paper, we tackle these problems by integrating multiple prosodic and phonological features to provide a multi-view, multi-granularity, and multi-aspect (3M) pronunciation modeling. Specifically, we augment GOP with prosodic and self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and meanwhile develop a vowel/consonant positional embedding for a more phonology-aware automatic

Table 1 provides an overview of available datasets, indicating English as a popular choice for the target language. Within this handful of datasets, a few datasets include phonetic/segmental-level transcription and even fewer provide manually rated word and sentence-level prosodic features, fluency along with overall proficiency scores offering insights to learner’s L2 speech intelligibility and comprehensiveness Arvaniti and Baltazani (2000); singa; Cole et al. (2017); Zhang et al. (2021b).

Furthermore, non-native datasets can enhance existing pronunciation assessment end-to-end approaches.Appendix B AnnotationIn this section, we provide an overview of the standard approaches to annotate segmental and supra-segmental errors widely used in MDD research.B.1 Segmental AnnotationSegmental human annotation can be approached from two perspectives. The first and the commonly utilized approach in most available MDD corpora involves linguistics experts transcribing the actual sequence of phonemes spoken by the learner Bonaventura et al. (2000); Zhao et al. (2018b); Vidal et al. (2019b). The resulted transcription is commonly referred as hypothesis annotation. Additionally, extra tasks can be incorporated, such as providing time boundaries for each pronounced phoneme, to further enhance the annotation process. This

The features that have beenused can be categorized into two classes: phonetic features and prosodic features. Phonetic features reflect thequality of the pronunciation of single phones (or words). The most successful phonetic features are the phone-level likelihood orposterior [1, 2], others include phone duration, formants, articulation class,phonetic distance, etc [8, 9].Prosodic features reflect the intonation, stress or fluency. The most popular prosodic features include the pitch and intensitycontour, rate of speech (phones per minute), and duration of silence [10, 11].Deriving pronunciation scores from these features can be accomplished by a simple average (e.g., if the features are phone-level posteriors),or a complex regression model (e.g., if the features are pitch and intensity contour) such as Gaussian
