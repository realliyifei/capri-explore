## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Classifier-based approaches in pronunciation assessment utilize both segmental and prosodic features to enhance the detection of pronunciation errors among speakers, particularly non-native ones. 

**Segmental Features:** These focus on individual phonemes and their specific errors. Classifier-based methods apply various classifiers to targeted phoneme pairs, analyzing their performance based on certain acoustic features. Commonly used features include Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which represent the short-term power spectrum of sound, along with its first and second derivatives. Additional acoustic characteristics such as energy, zero-crossing rates, and various spectral features are also employed [1][2]. Techniques like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and decision trees have been instrumental in identifying these segment-level discrepancies in pronunciation [1][2].

**Prosodic Features:** In contrast to segmental features, prosodic approaches examine the suprasegmental aspects of speech, which include lexical stress, pitch variations, duration, and other auditory characteristics that contribute to the rhythm and melody of speech. Classifiers such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used to assess these prosodic elements, which help detect errors related to intonation and stress patterns, offering a more holistic understanding of pronunciation beyond mere phonetic accuracy [1][2].

**Challenges and Integration:** Despite their respective strengths, classifier-based approaches face challenges, notably the dominance of segmental feature usage in much of the research. This focus can lead to issues in handling suprasegmental assessments due to discrepancies in feature granularity [3][4]. Moreover, there is a significant scarcity of large-scale labeled speech data for non-native speakers, which diminishes the effectiveness of automatic assessment systems [3][4]. To address these challenges, contemporary research is integrating multiple prosodic and phonological features into a more comprehensive framework known as multi-view, multi-granularity, and multi-aspect (3M) pronunciation modeling. The integration of segmental goodness of pronunciation (GOP) alongside prosodic and self-supervised learning features aims to create a more robust model for automatic pronunciation assessment [3][4].

In summary, classifier-based approaches utilize a blend of segmental features—targeting specific phoneme errors—and prosodic features—addressing rhythm and intonation—to improve pronunciation assessment. While segmented methods have been traditionally focused, present advancements seek to harmonize the use of these features for better overall performance.

On one hand, most of the studies focus exclusively on leveraging segmental (phonetic)-level features such as goodness of pronunciation (GOP); this, however, may cause a discrepancy of feature granularity when performing suprasegmental (prosodic)-level pronunciation assessment. On the other hand, automatic pronunciation assessments still suffer from the lack of large-scale labeled speech data of non-native speakers, which inevitably limits the performance of pronunciation assessment. In this paper, we tackle these problems by integrating multiple prosodic and phonological features to provide a multi-view, multi-granularity, and multi-aspect (3M) pronunciation modeling. Specifically, we augment GOP with prosodic and self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and meanwhile develop a vowel/consonant positional embedding for a more phonology-aware automatic

First, we show that our system generates speech that retains the relative comprehensibility of the original utterances. Then, we assess the impact of non-native segmental and prosodic characteristics on comprehensibility by synthesizing speech with varying combinations of voice quality, segmental features, and prosody from non-native and native speaker utterances.II Background and Related workRecent research on prosody modeling can be broadly divided into two categories, depending on whether it is being used for TTS or voice conversion (VC). In TTS, the goal of prosody modeling is to convey the desired emotions and nuances from a speaker, rather than merely convert words into sounds with the speaker’s voice quality/timbre. Most TTS
