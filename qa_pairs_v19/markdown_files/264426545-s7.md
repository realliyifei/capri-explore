## Answer

## I don't know?: False

Classifier-based approaches in pronunciation assessment utilize both segmental and prosodic features, each targeting different aspects of speech measurement and error correction.

Segmental approaches focus specifically on phoneme-level errors. They employ classifiers to identify and correct these errors by leveraging various acoustic features. Key components include Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and their derivatives, energy, zero-crossing rates, and spectral features. Classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and decision trees are commonly used in this context. These techniques allow for the accurate targeting of specific phoneme pair errors, thereby enhancing the assessment of pronunciation at a granular level [1][2].

In contrast, prosodic approaches address more holistic characteristics of speech, such as lexical stress and intonation patterns. These approaches rely on features such as energy, pitch, duration, and other spectral characteristics, using classifiers like Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). This focus on prosody is crucial for evaluating non-verbal cues that contribute to the overall comprehensibility and naturalness of speech [1][2].

Both segmental and prosodic features pose unique challenges; for instance, segmental features can sometimes lead to discrepancies in feature granularity when evaluating prosodic levels of pronunciation assessment. To bridge this gap, studies have proposed integrating segmental features, like goodness of pronunciation (GOP), with prosodic information to create a more comprehensive assessment model [3][4]. Additionally, the integration of self-supervised learning (SSL) features further aids in mitigating the limitations posed by the scarcity of labeled speech data from non-native speakers, enabling more effective and sophisticated pronunciation assessments [4].

The overall goal of using both segmental and prosodic approaches in classification is not only to correct pronunciation errors but also to enhance the perceived comprehensibility of accented speech. This is achieved through perceptual listening tests that assess how well the generated speech retains the original utterance's comprehensibility while varying segmental and prosodic features [5]. 

Thus, classifier-based approaches in pronunciation assessment benefit significantly from the dual application of segmental and prosodic features, facilitating a multi-faceted evaluation of speech that can adapt to the complexities inherent in language acquisition and speech production.

On the other hand, automatic pronunciation assessments still suffer from the lack of large-scale labeled speech data of non-native speakers, which inevitably limits the performance of pronunciation assessment. In this paper, we tackle these problems by integrating multiple prosodic and phonological features to provide a multi-view, multi-granularity, and multi-aspect (3M) pronunciation modeling. Specifically, we augment GOP with prosodic and self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and meanwhile develop a vowel/consonant positional embedding for a more phonology-aware automatic pronunciation assessment. A series of experiments conducted on the publicly-available speechocean762 dataset show that our approach can obtain significant improvements on several

[5]:  Passage ID 5: and, as a side benefit, improved transfer of voice characteristics.We use our proposed system to quantify the effect of segmental features and prosody on the perceived comprehensibility of accented speech through perceptual listening tests. First, we show that our system generates speech that retains the relative comprehensibility of the original utterances. Then, we assess the impact of non-native segmental and prosodic characteristics on comprehensibility by synthesizing speech with varying combinations of voice quality, segmental features, and prosody from non-native and native speaker utterances.II Background and Related workRecent research on prosody modeling can be broadly divided into two categories, depending on whether it is being used for TTS or voice conversion (VC). In TTS, the goal of prosody modeling is to convey the desired emotions and nuances from a speaker, rather than merely convert words into sounds with the speaker’s voice quality/timbre. Most TTS
