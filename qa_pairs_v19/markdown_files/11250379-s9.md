## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

The context provided does not directly address the specific advantages and difficulties associated with using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in speech recognition systems. While it mentions that HMMs are particularly effective for sequential data processing in tasks such as part-of-speech tagging [2], it does not elaborate on their application in speech recognition specifically.

To answer your question thoroughly, one would typically discuss several key aspects of using HMMs in speech recognition, such as:

1. **Advantages**:
   - **Sequential Data Handling**: HMMs excel in dealing with sequential data, which is crucial in speech where phonemes and words occur over time.
   - **Statistical Framework**: They provide a probabilistic model that can capture the temporal dynamics of speech.
   - **Flexibility**: HMMs can be trained on a variety of datasets and adapted to different languages and accents.

2. **Difficulties**:
   - **Training Data Requirements**: HMMs require a large amount of labeled training data to generalize well, which may not always be available.
   - **Model Complexity**: Designing effective HMM architectures can be complex, especially for languages with rich phonetic diversity.
   - **Limitations in Context**: HMMs may fail to capture longer dependencies and context in speech, as they typically assume independence between observations at different time steps.

However, since the provided context does not include detailed information about the advantages and difficulties of HMMs in speech recognition systems, I cannot provide a complete answer to your question based on the given material. Therefore, my response is: I don't know.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: second concern is the black-box nature of modern NLP models. We do not encourage decision-making systems to depend fully on NLP, but suggest that NLP can assist human decision-makers. Hence, all the applications introduced in this chapter use NLP to compile information that is necessary for policymaking instead of directly suggesting a policy. Nonetheless, some of the models are hard to interpret or explain, such as text classification using deep learning models (Yin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), which could be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by small paraphrasing of the text input (Jin et al., 2020). In practical applications, it is important to ensure the trustworthiness of the usage of AI. There could be a preference for transparent machine learning models if they can do the work well (e.g., LDA topic models, and traditional classification methods using dictionaries or linguistic rules), or tasks with well-controlled outputs such as event extraction to select spans of the
