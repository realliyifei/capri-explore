## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information about the advantages and difficulties associated with using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in speech recognition systems. Although it discusses early NLP techniques and mentions that HMMs were effective for sequential data processing in tasks such as part-of-speech tagging [2][3], it does not elaborate on HMMs' specific benefits or challenges in the context of speech recognition. Thus, the context is insufficient to directly answer the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: second concern is the black-box nature of modern NLP models. We do not encourage decision-making systems to depend fully on NLP, but suggest that NLP can assist human decision-makers. Hence, all the applications introduced in this chapter use NLP to compile information that is necessary for policymaking instead of directly suggesting a policy. Nonetheless, some of the models are hard to interpret or explain, such as text classification using deep learning models (Yin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), which could be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by small paraphrasing of the text input (Jin et al., 2020). In practical applications, it is important to ensure the trustworthiness of the usage of AI. There could be a preference for transparent machine learning models if they can do the work well (e.g., LDA topic models, and traditional classification methods using dictionaries or linguistic rules), or tasks with well-controlled outputs such as event extraction to select spans of the

Notable among these early models were Naive Bayes classifiers, which applied probabilistic methods to text classification; Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which excelled in high-dimensional spaces typical of text data; and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which proved particularly effective for sequential data processing in tasks such as part-of-speech tagging. These approaches laid the groundwork for more advanced techniques, demonstrating the potential of statistical methods in language processing and paving the way for the deep learning revolution in NLP.2 Rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)To overcome the limitations of traditional methods, Large Language Models (LLMs) were developed, which leveraged deep learning architectures such as neural networks. In NLP, LLMs represent a paradigm shift from traditional rule-based and statistical approaches to more sophisticated, data-driven approaches. This evolution was catalyzed by advancements in
