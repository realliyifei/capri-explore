## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information about rule-based machine translation systems, such as Apertium, or how they manage translations between closely related languages. The passages primarily discuss the evolution of natural language processing, advancements in machine translation technologies like word embeddings and the Transformer architecture, and issues with acronym disambiguation in state-of-the-art systems. Without specific details regarding Apertium or similar rule-based systems, I cannot provide a precise answer to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: language processing (NLP) do – predict the next word in a series of words. While high-resource languages like English and French are reported to achieve near human parity using common metrics for measurement such as BLEU and COMET, we find that an important step is being missed: the translation of technical terms, specifically acronyms. Some state-of-the art machine translation systems like Google Translate which are publicly available can be erroneous when dealing with acronyms – as much as 50% in our findings. This article addresses acronym disambiguation for MT systems by proposing an additional step to the SL–TL (FR–EN) translation workflow where we first offer a new acronym corpus for public consumption and then experiment with a search-based thresholding algorithm that achieves nearly 10% increase when compared to Google Translate and OpusMT.1 IntroductionWith the myriad of artificial intelligence tools available for professional translators, it can be hard for translators
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: generation, with emergent abilities that allow them to handle languages with scarce training data.The evolution of natural language processing from early techniques such as word embeddings [52] to current models highlights how far the field has come. The development of word embeddings in the early 2010s allowed words to be represented as dense vectors, capturing their semantic relationships. This led to the rise of sequence-to-sequence models [64], which transformed machine translation by enabling models to map input sequences (such as sentences in one language) to output sequences (sentences in another language) with a higher degree of fluency and accuracy. The introduction of the Transformer architecture [69] marked a turning point in the field, with its attention mechanisms enabling models to process entire sentences at once, rather than word by word, resulting in significant improvements in translation tasks.The field of machine translation has evolved from rule-based systems
