## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The provided context does not include any information regarding the functioning of modern rule-based machine translation systems, such as Apertium, and how they manage translations between closely related languages. The context primarily discusses the evolution of natural language processing, the shift from traditional methods to neural machine translation, and the advantages of contemporary approaches over rule-based systems. Therefore, it lacks sufficient details to answer the question about Apertium's methods.

[1]: Passage ID 1: generation, with emergent abilities that allow them to handle languages with scarce training data.The evolution of natural language processing from early techniques such as word embeddings [52] to current models highlights how far the field has come. The development of word embeddings in the early 2010s allowed words to be represented as dense vectors, capturing their semantic relationships. This led to the rise of sequence-to-sequence models [64], which transformed machine translation by enabling models to map input sequences (such as sentences in one language) to output sequences (sentences in another language) with a higher degree of fluency and accuracy. The introduction of the Transformer architecture [69] marked a turning point in the field, with its attention mechanisms enabling models to process entire sentences at once, rather than word by word, resulting in significant improvements in translation tasks.The field of machine translation has evolved from rule-based systems

We hope that our survey can help researchers to better understand this field and inspire them to design better algorithms, and help industry practitioners to choose appropriate algorithms for their applications.1 IntroductionMachine translation (MT) automatically translates from one language to another without human labor, which brings convenience and significantly reduces the labor cost in international exchange and cooperation. Powered by deep learning, neural machine translation (NMT)Â Bahdanau et al. (2015); Vaswani et al. (2017) has become the dominant approach for machine translation. Compared to conventional rule-based approaches and statistical machine translation (SMT), NMT enjoys two main advantages. First, it does not require professional human knowledge and design on translation perspective (e.g., grammatical rules). Second, neural network can better capture the
