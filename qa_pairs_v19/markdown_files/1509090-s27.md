## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not include specific information regarding the limitations and challenges faced by identification models in recognizing discontiguous and overlapping multiword expressions (MWEs). The passages primarily discuss the challenges of applying generative large language models (LLMs) to named entity recognition (NER) tasks, including issues such as hallucination and performance limitations of LLMs relative to supervised methods, but there is no mention of MWEs specifically or the challenges associated with recognizing them. This absence of relevant details makes it impossible to provide an accurate or comprehensive answer to the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: the domain-specific NER task. Through these tailored strategies, we aim to bridge the gap between the broad capabilities of LLMs and the precise requirements of domain-specific information extraction tasks, paving the way for more effective and efficient utilization of generative language models in specialized domains.4.1 Challenges in Applying LLMs to NER TasksThe integration of generative LLMs into NER tasks introduces a set of unique challenges that can significantly impact the performance and reliability of extraction outcomes. One of the most prevalent issues in generative NER approaches is the phenomenon of hallucination[10], where the model generates entities not present in the test instance. This can result from the model misinterpreting the provided examples as part of the text from which entities should be extracted, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the results.nFurthermore, matching problems during the location of mention positions present considerable

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: evaluate the ability of LLMs to solve the task, notably implementing two prompting strategies to adapt LLMs for the task and a dedicated feedback loop. In line with concurrent work Han et al. (2023), LLMs achieve limited performance for skill extraction relative to supervised methods. Moreover, we highlight the limitations of the current SE task formulation and evaluation, focusing on the adaptation of the NER sequence labeling task, to the token generation task with which LLMs are pre-trained.In particular, we list the causes of the most frequent errors in SE with GPT-3.5. In the absence of training data, LLMs struggle to understand what skills are and often extract irrelevant information. Additionally, GPT-3.5 tends to split conjoined skills into two, leading to less accurate but more granular skill extractions. In a real-world setting, in particular when SE is used as a preliminary step for skill classification in a taxonomy (e.g. ESCO, le Vrang et al., 2014), this behavior would

However, challenges remain in attaining human-like reasoning and generalization abilities, driving continued research for more sophisticated and robust NLP models.Gaps.Although LLMs have shown impressive performance on many reasoning benchmarks Brown et al. (2020b); Ouyang et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2022); Touvron et al. (2023a); OpenAI (2023), there are still several directions that remain challenging.They struggle to robustly manage formal reasoning Jin et al. (2022b); Stolfo et al. (2023); Jin et al. (2023a), as we often see LLMs prone to errors that a formal or symbolic system would not make.Additionally, since most of their training interacts with a world of text, NLP models still lack grounding in real-world experiences when reasoning Ignat et al. (2021).Lastly, more fundamental questions remain to be answered, such as distinguishing empirical knowledge and rational reasoning, and unveiling how LLMs
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: models. They work by tying together token features to identify spans. However, as pre-trained LLMs like GPT-4 and beyond grow ever stronger, they also become less accessible for specific use in AI tasks like information extraction. Therefore, we expect the use of in-context learning and further development of context-based prompts will increase. Ongoing work in retrieve-to-augment and generate-to-augment strategies have potential to enhance performance in many information extraction tasks as they have already been successful in open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks [111].In summary, the goal of this survey is to challenge the reader to reconsider information extraction to be the task of finding spans in text that represent some class-label. By recasting the myriad traditional information extraction tasks into this new orientation, they can all be viewed as analogs of one another. Having a unified view of this critical task is important as AI undergoes a shift due to the advent
