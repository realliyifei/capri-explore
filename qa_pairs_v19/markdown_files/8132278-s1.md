## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The automatic distinction between idiomatic and literal uses of multiword expressions (MWEs) is a significant challenge in natural language processing (NLP). This task revolves around identifying whether a sentence incorporates an idiomatic expression (i.e., a phrase whose meaning cannot be inferred from the meanings of its individual words) or whether it represents a more literal interpretation of the words involved.

One effective way to tackle this distinction involves employing semantic text similarity measures that require models to represent potentially idiomatic expressions within their contextual usage adequately. This approach means understanding not only the meanings of the words contextually but also how they interact within phrases that may carry idiomatic meanings [1] [2] [3]. 

Additionally, the identification of MWEs is essential in various NLP tasks, such as machine translation (MT), where they often pose challenges due to their unique syntactic and semantic behavior compared to typical word combinations. For instance, a phrase like "kick the bucket" carries a completely different connotation as an idiom (meaning to die) than its literal interpretation would suggest [4] [5]. As such, models must be trained on diverse datasets that include both idiomatic and literal usages to discern between the two effectively.

In recent developments, research has focused on creating datasets annotated for MWEs across different languages, including English, Portuguese, and Galician. These datasets help train models using different amounts of training data and various evaluation metrics, which contribute to improving the identification capabilities for both idiomatic and literal usages of MWEs [1] [2] [3].

Moreover, ongoing advancements in machine translation evaluation metrics, such as human-in-the-loop approaches, are exploring how accurately different MT systems can recognize and translate MWEs. These efforts highlight MWEs as critical indicators of a system's fluency and adequacy, enhancing the understanding of contextual meanings versus literal meanings in machine-generated text [4] [5].

Overall, successfully distinguishing between idiomatic and literal uses of MWEs requires advanced models that leverage extensive, well-annotated datasets and sophisticated semantic analysis techniques. The continuous evolution of these methods is paramount for future improvements in various NLP applications, including translation, sentiment analysis, and content generation.
