## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The automatic distinction between idiomatic and literal uses of multiword expressions (MWEs) is a significant challenge in the field of natural language processing (NLP). This is primarily due to the differing linguistic behavior of MWEs compared to generic word combinations, where idiomatic expressions do not conform to literal interpretations [1] [3]. 

Recent approaches have proposed various tasks and methodologies to tackle this challenge. One key method involves identifying sentences containing idiomatic expressions through a binary classification task. In this task, a model evaluates whether a sentence includes an idiomatic phrase by leveraging contextual information from additional sentences. Such a method allows for improved detection of idiomaticity, which is essential since idiomatic expressions often possess semantics that deviates from the sum of their parts [4]. 

Another method focuses on semantic text similarity, particularly within the context of idiomatic expressions [4]. This task requires the model to assess the semantic similarity among sentences that contain an idiomatic phrase, its correct literal paraphrase, and an incorrect literal paraphrase. By training models on these comparisons, researchers can develop systems that better understand the nuanced meanings of MWEs and identify when they are used idiomatically or literally.

Moreover, a significant part of this research involves the evaluation of various machine translation (MT) systems regarding their capability to recognize and translate MWEs. MWEs can serve as distinguishing factors for evaluating MT systems by examining their accuracy in both recognizing and translating these expressions meaningfully [2]. The HilMeMe framework, which employs a human-in-the-loop evaluation process, emphasizes the importance of MWEs in MT assessment and allows for detailed error classification based on the translation of idiomatic expressions [3].

The development of annotated datasets, such as AlphaMWE, also enhances the training of models for distinguishing between idiomatic and literal uses of MWEs. These resources provide a base for multilingual parallel annotations, contributing not only to translation accuracy but also facilitating deeper analysis of domain-specific linguistic aspects [5]. The datasets aid in creating a more robust understanding of how idiomatic expressions should be interpreted and used in translations.

Ultimately, the combination of context-based classification tasks, semantic similarity evaluations, and rigorous dataset training are critical methodologies employed in distinguishing between idiomatic and literal uses of MWEs in English and potentially in other languages as well. As research evolves, these methodologies are expected to become more sophisticated, potentially incorporating advances in machine learning and human evaluation to refine the automatic processing of MWEs.

Each Subtask includes different settings regarding the amount of training data. Besides the task description, this paper introduces the datasets in English, Portuguese, and Galician and their annotation procedure, the evaluation metrics, and a summary of the participant systems and their results. The task had close to 100 registered participants organised into twenty five teams making over 650 and 150 submissions in the practice and evaluation phases respectively.1 IntroductionMultiword Expressions (MWEs) are a challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as their linguistic behaviour (e.g., syntactic, semantic) differs from that of generic word combinations Baldwin and Kim (2010); Ramisch and Villavicencio (2018). Moreover, MWEs are pervasive in all domains Biber

We will make the platform open-source for research purpose at https://github.com/poethan/HilMeMe.This methodology takes MWEs as one important factor in the assessment procedure, in addition to judging the overall contextual sentence or segment level translation performances.It asks assessors to do certain level classification of the error types regarding MWE translations, e.g. if it is translated correctly or not, using reference MWEs or alternatives or common phrases, etc. These classification behaviours are saved in our toolkit and can be exported for researchers to carry out further analysis of their system outputs.

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: tightly coupled. Recently Tayyar Madabushi et al. (2022) proposed a task of multilingual idiomaticity detection and idiomaticity representation. The proposed idiomaticity detection is a binary task to identify whether a sentence contains an idiomatic expression with the help of two context sentences. This task has a zero-shot setting in which MWEs in the training set and test set are disjoint. It also has a One Shot setting in which the training set has one idiomatic and one non-idiomatic example of each MWE in the test set. The idiomaticity representation task is an idiomatic semantic textual similarity task, in which the semantic similarity between sentences with an idiomatic phrase, correct literal paraphrase of the idiomatic phrase, and incorrect literal paraphrase of the idiomatic phrase should be predicted.Constant et al. (2017) did a detailed survey on multiword expression (MWE) processing by dividing it into two subtasks: MWE (type) discovery and MWE (token) identification.

For domain-specific content, the MWE annotated corpus can be prepared on the fly in the course of translation evaluation process.MWEs have been a big challenge for many Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks due to their idiomaticity, low-frequency, and richness in variety.The study on MWEs involves a broad list of research topics, such as idioms, metaphors, slang, fixed and semi-fixed
