## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided is insufficient to answer the question regarding the two main types of automatic metrics used in machine translation (MT) research and how they differ. While it mentions that there are many translation metrics, including automated metrics and human metrics [5], it does not specify or detail what those two main types of automatic metrics are or explain their differences. Further information or examples would be required to fully address your question.

More details are introduced in the following part. (1) Rule-based machine translation (RBMT) converts the source languages to target languages based on the linguistics-based rules specified by humans (Hutchins, 1995), featuring consistency and stability but low efficiency (Dove, 2012). Different languages have their own rules and contain oceans of text information; therefore, highly automation and efficiency are its two main problems. (2) A corpus-based system with statistical machine translation (SMT) or phrase-based machine translation (PB- SMT) as the primary
[5]: Passage ID 5: of the MT translated sentences were flawed; there were less lexical variety and local coherence in NMT; NMT are more likely to mimic the source sentence’s grammatical structure; besides, the style of HT differs from that of MT (Webster et al., 2020).2.2 Metrics for translation qualityTranslation metric is a kind of method to evaluate the translation quality. In the past decades, many metrics have been developed for translation evaluation. There are many translation metrics nowadays containing automated metrics and human metrics. Although Chatzikoumi (2020) claimed that two types of metrics are in practice not distinguishable as human labor work and machine calculation are interwoven, the pros and cons of each metric are analyzed in the following section.2.2.1 Automatic evaluation of machine translationAutomated metrics for evaluating translation quality are convenient, relying on computational calculation to reduce labor work and improve efficiency.
