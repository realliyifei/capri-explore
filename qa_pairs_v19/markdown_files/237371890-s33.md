## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

The context provided does not specify the two main types of automatic metrics used in machine translation (MT) research or their differences. It mentions that there are many translation metrics, including automated metrics and human metrics, but does not elaborate on what constitutes the two main types or how they differ from one another. Additionally, while some characteristics of automated metrics are highlighted — such as convenience and reliance on computational calculation to improve efficiency — there is no mention of specific types or a clear distinction between the two categories.

Hence, I must conclude, "I don't know" as the context is insufficient to answer the question about the two main types of automatic metrics and their differences.

We hope that our survey can help researchers to better understand this field and inspire them to design better algorithms, and help industry practitioners to choose appropriate algorithms for their applications.1 IntroductionMachine translation (MT) automatically translates from one language to another without human labor, which brings convenience and significantly reduces the labor cost in international exchange and cooperation.

More details are introduced in the following part. (1) Rule-based machine translation (RBMT) converts the source languages to target languages based on the linguistics-based rules specified by humans (Hutchins, 1995), featuring consistency and stability but low efficiency (Dove, 2012). Different languages have their own rules and contain oceans of text information; therefore, highly automation and efficiency are its two main problems. (2) A corpus-based system with statistical machine translation (SMT) or phrase-based machine translation (PB- SMT) as the primary

[4]:  Passage ID 4: of the MT translated sentences were flawed; there were less lexical variety and local coherence in NMT; NMT are more likely to mimic the source sentence’s grammatical structure; besides, the style of HT differs from that of MT (Webster et al., 2020).2.2 Metrics for translation qualityTranslation metric is a kind of method to evaluate the translation quality. In the past decades, many metrics have been developed for translation evaluation. There are many translation metrics nowadays containing automated metrics and human metrics. Although Chatzikoumi (2020) claimed that two types of metrics are in practice not distinguishable as human labor work and machine calculation are interwoven, the pros and cons of each metric are analyzed in the following section.2.2.1 Automatic evaluation of machine translationAutomated metrics for evaluating translation quality are convenient, relying on computational calculation to reduce labor work and improve efficiency. Reference-based
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: highly automation and efficiency are its two main problems. (2) A corpus-based system with statistical machine translation (SMT) or phrase-based machine translation (PB- SMT) as the primary method uses machine learning algorithms by using a large amount of parallel corpus as input, overcoming the problem of using labor work to boost efficiency automatically (Lopez, 2008); however, it has issues such as with translation for idiomatic expressions, compound words that have to be translated by more than one word, long dependencies, and ambiguous words with different meanings depending on contexts (Nießen, 2000). (3) The currently predominant neural machine translation (NMT) system has gained the most extensive popularity in machine translation domain. In contrast to more established system SMT, NMT makes use of its architecture and capacity to capture complex sentence dependencies, which suggests that it has a great deal of potential to become a new trend in machine translation.
