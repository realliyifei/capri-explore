## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

Filtering methods enhance the quality of questions generated by neural ranking models in open-domain question answering (QA) systems by improving the accuracy and relevance of answer candidates, facilitating better overall QA quality. These methods focus on validating and filtering answers to ensure that only the most accurate and contextually appropriate responses are presented.

One of the main benefits of filtering methods is their ability to significantly increase QA quality by removing incorrect answers from consideration. Research indicates that effective filtering approaches can lead to a highly improved QA quality, as they often succeed in eliminating the majority of incorrect answers from a candidate list. This is particularly crucial in the context of open-domain QA, where the diversity of potential questions can lead to a wide array of answer candidates, not all of which are correct or relevant [1] [2].

The effectiveness of these filtering methods is underpinned by their reliance on well-formed natural language (NL) representations of answers. Specifically, if a QA system can provide high-quality NL answers, filtering becomes a task of identifying and removing incorrect answers based on their NL representation. This capability not only helps in refining potential answers but also directly contributes to metrics that evaluate the performance of QA systems, such as Precision@k and NDCG@k, which gauge the relevance of the answers retrieved [1] [3].

Additionally, the intrinsic quality of the questions posed to the system also plays a critical role in the effectiveness of filtering methods. By ensuring that questions are well-structured and appropriately targeted, the filtering methodologies can leverage the meaning and context embedded within the NL representations to better assess the validity of potential answers [3] [4]. For instance, when filtering methods are applied, they can focus on the linguistic cues and contextual signals in the answers, thereby enhancing the performance of the neural ranking models used in the QA systems.

Moreover, advancements in machine learning and natural language generation have led to improved approaches for the automated generation of NL answers from structured data (e.g., SPARQL queries). This process, which involves creating NL responses from a set of answer candidates, emphasizes the necessity of filtering for quality control in generated answers, as not all generated answers will meet the required quality standards [3] [5]. 

In conclusion, filtering methods enhance the quality of questions generated by neural ranking models in open-domain QA systems by increasing the correctness and relevance of answer candidates, thus improving overall system performance metrics. The reliance on high-quality NL representations and the reinforcement of clear, context-aware questions are essential elements in achieving this enhanced quality, making filtering a vital component of modern QA systems [2] [5].

[3]:  Passage ID 3: training negatively affects mostly the recall which is the most important metric for the intended goal.Hence, assuming NL answers of very high quality are provided by a QA system, then our approach should be capable of identifying (and therefore, filtering) incorrect answers.VI-B Experiment 2: NLG of limited qualityIn this setting, we are evaluating artificially generated NL answers.There are computed automatically from SPARQL queries and the corresponding results.To our best knowledge, there is no KGQA system available that is providing an API to produce full-fledged NL answers.Consequently, it is required to generate answer verbalization from the available information (i.e.,¬†SPARQL query candidates).Generating artificial answers in a three-step process includes (1) providing a question in textual form to the KGQA system, (2) sending the computed SPARQL query answer candidates to Wikidata, and (3) generating NL representation from the obtained list of the query
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: the query must be answered by the passage it originated from [33]. In previous studies, to train the consistency filter, external QA models were preferred. For instance,¬†Lewis et¬†al. [34] introduced probably asked questions to enhance the performance of the closed-book QA (CBQA) model. To remove the QA models, ¬†Dai et¬†al. [13] trained an encoder-decoder as a consistency filter using a small group of in-domain query and document pairs.3 ExperimentOur task is to perform ad-hoc ranking on D={qi,dj|i=1,2,‚ãØ,n;j=1,2,‚ãØ,m}ùê∑conditional-setsubscriptùëûùëñsubscriptùëëùëóformulae-sequenceùëñ12‚ãØùëõùëó12‚ãØùëöD=\{q_{i},d_{j}|i=1,2,\cdots,n;j=1,2,\cdots,m\}, where {qi}subscriptùëûùëñ\{q_{i}\} and {dj}subscriptùëëùëó\{d_{j}\} represent the queries and documents, respectively.

Finally, extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.2 Related WorksQA is a critical task in natural language processing, enabling the extraction of factual information from extensive knowledge corpora like Wikipedia, which has been applied in a wide range of fields[19]. Retriever-reader methods, currently the most effective approach in QA, comprise two key modules: a retriever, which fetches relevant documents in response to a given question, and a reader, leveraging a neural machine reading comprehension model to deduce the final answer from the retrieved documents.Neural Retrievers.Neural network-based models have enhanced data representation, thereby advancing automated learning processes[18, 16, 23, 5].They have also been introduced to automatically learn query and document representations from labeled data.However, dense
