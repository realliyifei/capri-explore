## Answer (I don't know?: âœ“)

I don't know. The provided context does not specifically address advancements in deep learning models concerning biomedical coreference resolution or detail the outcomes of such enhancements. While the context discusses various applications of BioNLP and the use of large language models (LLMs) for different tasks, it lacks focused information on coreference resolution, including any specific improvements, methodologies, or results that pertain to this particular aspect of biomedical NLP. The references primarily highlight a general evaluation of LLMs and their applications in BioNLP without delving into the specifics of coreference resolution advancements or their implications.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: knowledge discovery. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) has emerged as a powerful solution, enabling the automated extraction of information and knowledge from this extensive literature. Recent attention has been directed towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their impressive performance. However, there remains a critical gap in understanding the effectiveness of LLMs in BioNLP tasks and their broader implications for method development and downstream users. Currently, there is a lack of baseline performance data, benchmarks, and practical recommendations for using LLMs in the biomedical domain. To address this gap, we present a systematic evaluation of four representative LLMs: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (closed-source), LLaMA 2 (open-sourced), and PMC LLaMA (domain-specific) across 12 BioNLP datasets covering six applications (named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question answering, text summarization, and text simplification).

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: applications range from tasks previously tackled by NLP techniques, such as clinical acronym disambiguation, to those unattainable a decade ago. For example, medical chatbots that can assist both patients and healthcare professionals are now emerging. In response to these advancements, the research community has been actively developing language models specifically designed for medical applications. The evolution of these models, from pre-training and fine-tuning strategies to creating open-source models capable of zero-shot learning, highlights the growing synergy between artificial intelligence and healthcare [88, 94, 113, 95].Early medical language models were predominantly based on BERT and followed the common trend of the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. ClinicalBERT [55], pre-trained on the MIMIC-III [56] dataset and fine-tuned to predict hospital readmissions, was one of the pioneering models in this domain. Another notable model, BioBERT, was pre-trained on the PubMed

A typical solution is to insert a multilayer perception (MLP) on top of the language model and train the entire model via fine-tuning. For example, Alsentzer et al. fine-tune BioClinicalBERT on four i2b2 NER tasks 8. Similarly, Sung et al. present BERN2, which uses Bio-LM 9 as the foundation model and achieves better performance via multitask learning 10.A common theme among the aforementioned deep-learning-based methods is their data-hungry nature, which unfortunately poses significant challenges in the medical field, where issues of data scarcity, heterogeneity, and confidentiality are consistently prevalent. The situation is even worse for rare diseases due

Further, bringing together general medical knowledge and personal patient information requires new strategies for knowledge integration. Since clinical diagnoses and treatments are high-stake decisions, it is crucial that the NLP systems be reliable and interpretable, to provide clear reasoning behind their predictions. Such processes also require the interdisciplinary collaboration with medical experts to make sure that the system aligns with their domain knowledge and clinical practice.3.Drug discovery. Drug discovery is a critical research area that has often been considered in relation to biomedical and chemical research, but more recently has gained the attention of NLP researchers. NLP methods can enable the efficient extraction and analysis of information from large amounts of scientific literature, patents, sovical media,
