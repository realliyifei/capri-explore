## Answer (I don't know?: âœ“)

I don't know. The provided context does not contain specific information regarding advancements in deep learning models focused on biomedical coreference resolution or their outcomes. The passages discuss various aspects of biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) and the challenges faced within the healthcare sector, particularly concerning the integration and utilization of large language models (LLMs). However, there is no mention of coreference resolution or detailed outcomes related to advancements in this particular area, rendering the context insufficient to accurately answer your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: by Qingyu Chen and 20 other authorsView PDFAbstract:The biomedical literature is rapidly expanding, posing a significant challenge for manual curation and knowledge discovery. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) has emerged as a powerful solution, enabling the automated extraction of information and knowledge from this extensive literature. Recent attention has been directed towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their impressive performance. However, there remains a critical gap in understanding the effectiveness of LLMs in BioNLP tasks and their broader implications for method development and downstream users. Currently, there is a lack of baseline performance data, benchmarks, and practical recommendations for using LLMs in the biomedical domain. To address this gap, we present a systematic evaluation of four representative LLMs: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (closed-source), LLaMA 2 (open-sourced), and PMC LLaMA (domain-specific) across 12 BioNLP datasets covering six
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: the intrinsic complexities of clinical text, including irregularities like ambiguous medical jargon and nonstandard phrase structures. Despite the powerful capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to comprehend medical language in healthcare settings [5], such irregularities make it difficult for standard NLP tools to perform effectively when applied to clinical text, which necessitates domain-specific expertise for accurate annotation [6].However, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the healthcare sector is not without its constraints, particularly due to the confidentiality requirements governing clinical information. These requirements significantly restrict the availability and utilization of public datasets, which are essential for training and fine-tuning LLMs. This constraint is further compounded by the need for secure and compliant IT system integration in healthcare [7]. The sensitivity of patient data requires robust security measures to prevent
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: of diverse and institution-specific datasets, complicating the development of broadly applicable NLP tools in the healthcare field. These models that do not integrate these elements are generally restrained to tasks where labels are naturally generated in the course of clinical practice, such as the prediction of International Classification of Diseases Codes [11] or mortality risk assessments [12].Figure 1: Example of a patient-doctor dialogue with annotated data elements for NER, highlighting the extraction of patient names, medications, symptoms, conditions, and precautions.In response to these challenges, there is an emerging trend and a pressing need to develop AI-enabled, next-generation Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) or LLMs specifically tailored for the healthcare industry [13]. These advanced models not only provide accurate and error-free medical information but also address the ethical, legal, and practical concerns inherent in their deployment in sensitive
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: model scale, and integrated chain-of-thought, with Ouyang et al. 16 introducing a unique reinforcement learning perspective. Nevertheless, despite its notable progress in general NLP scenarios, the biomedical field finds itself underrepresented, primarily attributed to the missing tailored instruction sets. Addressing this lacuna, our study introduces a comprehensive BioNLP instruction dataset, curated with limited human intervention.Specifically, we introduce BioInstruct, a dataset comprising more than 25,000 natural language instructions along with their corresponding inputs and outputs. Drawing inspiration from recent work that leverages the GPT language model for data generation 17, we collect BioInstruct in a fully automated manner. We prompt a pre-trained LLM, GPT-4, with a sample of three examples (as seeds) from our manually collected triplets (instructions, input, output), then instruct the model to generate new instructions as illustrated in Appendix Table 5. Through this

[5]:  Passage ID 5: such as names of people, organizations, or locations; relation extraction transformers [21, 22, 23] discern and extract relationships between entities within a text; sentence similarity tasks [24, 25, 26] involve evaluating the degree of similarity or relatedness between two sentences; natural language inference [27, 28] is about determining the logical relationship between a pair of sentences, such as whether one implies, contradicts, or is neutral to the other; question answering [29, 30] these models comprehend a given text and accurately respond to questions based on that text, demonstrating a deep understanding of content and context.The healthcare and medical sectors are facing the challenge of streamlining medical documentation processes, which are essential but also labour-intensive and time-consuming. Addressing this issue has increased interest in LLMs to develop improved NER systems. These systems are designed not only to extract and interpret information from medical
