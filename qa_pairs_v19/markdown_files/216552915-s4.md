## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úó)

To analyze beliefs about social dimensions using word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP), several key steps and considerations must be taken into account:

1. **Understanding Word Embeddings**: Word embeddings are dense, low-dimensional representations of words as vectors in a continuous vector space, which facilitate semantic similarities through geometric calculations. This concept is grounded in the distributional hypothesis, which posits that words occurring in similar contexts bear related meanings [2][3]. A thorough understanding of this foundational theory is essential as it informs how embeddings capture the nuances of social beliefs.

2. **Selection of Word Embedding Models**: Various models exist for generating word embeddings, including Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText. Each of these methods has its strengths and is suited for different types of data and applications [3][4]. It is important to choose a model based on the specific context and requirements of the social beliefs being analyzed. For instance, context-sensitive embeddings like ELMo, BERT, and GPT have shown greater adaptability and accuracy in capturing contextual meanings [3].

3. **Data Preparation**: The success of embedding models is heavily reliant on the quality and preprocessing of textual data. This may involve cleaning the data, removing noise, and standardizing terminology to ensure consistency. Given the complexity and richness of social data, careful selection of text sources is critical to capturing the relevant beliefs accurately [5].

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Traditional representation methods such as one-hot encoding pose computational challenges due to their high dimensionality. The transition to word embeddings significantly reduces dimensionality, allowing for more manageable computation and better handling of large vocabularies. Continued advances in embedding techniques further optimize this process [1][4].

5. **Contextual Analysis**: When analyzing beliefs about social dimensions, it is crucial to consider the context in which words are used. This can involve examining the co-occurrence of terms within specific frameworks to identify underlying sentiments or themes. Contextual embeddings are particularly effective for this purpose, as they account for variations in meaning across different usages [2][3].

6. **Evaluation Metrics and Machine Learning Integration**: To assess the effectiveness of the embeddings in capturing social beliefs, one must utilize appropriate evaluation metrics. These can range from clustering analysis to classification accuracies, depending on the specific social dimensions being studied. The embeddings can serve as features for various machine learning algorithms, enhancing their performance in tasks such as sentiment analysis and topic extraction [5].

7. **Multi-modal Approaches**: Given the complexity of social beliefs, it may be beneficial to integrate word embeddings with other modalities (such as vision or audio) when analyzing data. Such multi-modal approaches can provide a more comprehensive understanding of social dimensions and beliefs [3].

In summary, the analysis of beliefs about social dimensions through word embeddings involves careful consideration of model selection, data preparation, context, and multi-modal integration, while continuously evaluating the effectiveness of these embeddings through appropriate metrics. Understanding the underpinning theories and dynamics of word representations will significantly enhance the depth and accuracy of the analysis.

Word embedding is the dominant approach in NLP problems compare to one-hot encoding. If the words are present in the vocabulary in one-hot encoding, then assign one else zero. The issue in one hot encoding is a computational issue. When you increase your vocabulary by size n, the feature size vector also increases by length n, requiring more computational time to train the model. A word embedding is a learned representation for text data where words or phrases with the same meaning have a similar representation mapped further either in vector or real numbers. The strategy typically includes a mathematic concept from a high-dimensional vector space to a lower-dimensional vector space.The vectors encoding is

University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom*corresponding author:bm517@cam.ac.uk1 Background & SummaryWord embeddings, dense low-dimensional representations of words as real-number vectors [23], are widely used in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as part-of-speech tagging, information retrieval, question answering, sentiment analysis, and are employed in other research areas, including biomedical sciences [28] and scientometrics [1]. One of the reasons for this success is that such representations allow us to perform vector calculations in geometric spaces which can be interpreted in semantic terms (i.e. in terms of the similarity in the meaning of words). This follows the so-called distributional hypothesis [21], according to which words occurring in a given word‚Äôs context contribute to some aspects of its meaning, and semantically similar words share similar contexts.
