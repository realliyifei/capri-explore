## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

To analyze beliefs about social dimensions using word embeddings, several key steps and considerations must be addressed, especially with regard to ethical implications and methodological choices.

1. **Understanding Word Embeddings**: Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and GloVe, represent words in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are geometrically closer to each other. This method allows for a nuanced understanding of language by reflecting relationships between words based on their contexts, which is foundational when analyzing beliefs associated with social dimensions [3] [5].

2. **Ethical Considerations**: The application of word embeddings in analyzing social dimensions necessitates awareness of biases embedded within the data. It is essential to recognize that these embeddings can inadvertently reflect societal biases, which could affect both the model's fairness and the ethical implications of its use. Prior work has emphasized that examining potentially harmful features in machine learning is crucial for fair implementations. For instance, leveraging the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) can help in identifying and quantifying such biases [1] [2]. This task involves measuring associations that could lead to biased outcomes based on social dimensions.

3. **Investigating Valence Associations**: One important aspect of using word embeddings for social dimensions involves analyzing the valence of words, categorizing them as either pleasant or unpleasant. This can provide insights into societal attitudes and sentiments towards various social groups or concepts. Such analyses are not only applicable in sentiment classification but also in detecting targeted language, which is particularly relevant in contexts like information operations and hate speech detection [1]. Tools like WEAT can assist in quantifying these attitudes and thereby provide a clear metric for understanding beliefs about social dimensions.

4. **Data Preparation**: When using embeddings, data quality is paramount. This includes preprocessing the text data to remove noise, selecting relevant corpora, and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the social dimensions being studied. The training process should also be scrutinized to avoid amplifying biases present in the training data [3] [4].

5. **Visualization and Interpretation**: After applying word embeddings, it is important to visualize the results to interpret the underlying patterns effectively. Techniques such as t-SNE or PCA can help in visualizing high-dimensional data in a way that reveals relationships and clusters pertaining to social beliefs [5]. Interpreting these visualizations can be complex, and they should always be contextualized within existing societal knowledge and theory.

6. **Continuous Evaluation and Iteration**: Finally, it is essential to continuously evaluate the model's performance and the implications of its findings on social beliefs. This involves both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis to ensure that the embeddings and their interpretations are robust, relevant, and ethically sound [3].

In summary, when utilizing word embeddings to analyze beliefs about social dimensions, consideration must be given to the nature of the data, potential biases, the ethical implications of findings, and the methods used for analysis and interpretation. These steps ensure a holistic and responsible approach to understanding social beliefs through natural language processing techniques.

Additionally, the computational resources required for training and deploying LLMs have spurred research into more efficient architectures and training methodologies.Word Embeddings: Techniques such as Word2Vec and GloVe introduced the idea of embedding words in a continuous vector space, where the distance between words reflects their semantic relationships. This allowed for a more nuanced understanding of language. Word embeddings represent a significant advancement in the field of NLP, offering a sophisticated method for representing words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. This approach, pioneered by techniques such as

Word embedding is the dominant approach in NLP problems compare to one-hot encoding. If the words are present in the vocabulary in one-hot encoding, then assign one else zero. The issue in one hot encoding is a computational issue. When you increase your vocabulary by size n, the feature size vector also increases by length n, requiring more computational time to train the model. A word embedding is a learned representation for text data where words or phrases with the same meaning have a similar representation mapped further either in vector or real numbers. The strategy typically includes a mathematic concept from a high-dimensional vector space to a lower-dimensional vector space.The vectors encoding is

University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom*corresponding author:bm517@cam.ac.uk1 Background & SummaryWord embeddings, dense low-dimensional representations of words as real-number vectors [23], are widely used in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as part-of-speech tagging, information retrieval, question answering, sentiment analysis, and are employed in other research areas, including biomedical sciences [28] and scientometrics [1]. One of the reasons for this success is that such representations allow us to perform vector calculations in geometric spaces which can be interpreted in semantic terms (i.e. in terms of the similarity in the meaning of words). This follows the so-called distributional hypothesis [21], according to which words occurring in a given word’s context contribute to some aspects of its meaning, and semantically similar words share similar contexts. In Firth’s words
