## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information regarding the LIAR dataset or the challenges associated with its use for fact-checking. The passages focus on aspects of natural language processing (NLP), including dataset generation, performance issues, and the vulnerabilities of NLP models, but do not specifically address the LIAR dataset or its challenges in fact-checking. Thus, I cannot provide an answer to your question based on the given context.

[1]: Passage ID 1: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
[2]: Passage ID 2: work well (e.g., LDA topic models, and traditional classification methods using dictionaries or linguistic rules), or tasks with well-controlled outputs such as event extraction to select spans of the given text that mention events. In cases where only the deep learning models can provide good performance, there should be more detailed performance analysis (e.g., a study to check the correlation of the model decisions and human judgments), error analysis (e.g., different types of errors, failure modes, and potential bias towards certain groups), and studies about the interpretability of the model (e.g., feature attribution of the model, visualization of the internal states of the model).Apart from the limitations of the technical methodology, there are also ethical considerations arising from the use of NLP. Among the use cases introduced in this chapter, some applications of NLP are relatively safe as they mainly involve analyzing public political documents and fact-based evidence

Examples for high-quality, inconsistent, and unnatural test cases generated by existing testing techniques on different datasets.NLP tasks include Sentiment Analysis (SA), Natural Language Inference (NLI), and Semantic Equivalence (SE).Mutated words are marked in red.Original textTaskTechniqueGenerated
[4]: Passage ID 4: number of either questions and answers (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Rajpurkaret al., 2018; Reddyet al., 2019), or conversational dialogue (Gopalakrishnanet al., 2019; Sun and Zhang, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). We found that existing NLP datasets do not cover the wide breadth of possible conversational failure cases due to their emphasis on correct data for training. Additionally, their focus on specific task performance, such as answering questions or dialogue generation, is more narrow than the variety of use cases for voice assistants. As training data relies on accurate task completion, these datasets did not contain failures. While testing these models produces a small percentage of errors (roughly 10%), the types of failures could only fall in the response and understanding categories, as attention and perception failures are excluded from the context of training these types of models. This limited their usefulness for our purpose of understanding voice assistant failures that occur
[5]: Passage ID 5: engines [69], and information retrieval in fields like medicine [19] and law [35]. However, despite the significant progress in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP), these models remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, leading to misinformation, privacy breaches, and flawed decision-making in critical areas [23, 8, 15, 52]. This highlights the importance of understanding how adversarial examples are generated from the attackers’ perspective and potential defense mechanisms — an area that remains under-explored.QA models are expected to comprehend given texts and questions, providing accurate and contextually relevant answers [50]. These models primarily address two types of questions: Informative Queries and Boolean Queries. The Informative Queries typically begin with interrogative words such as “who,” “what,” “where,” “when,” “why,” or “how,” requiring detailed and specific information from the provided context. Although models like T5 [43], LongT5 [14], and BART
