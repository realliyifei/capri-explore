## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not mention the LIAR dataset nor any specific challenges associated with it. The passages focus on automated fact-checking prototypes, data claims verification, challenges in building models for detecting undesired content, and the use of general NLP techniques. However, they do not provide details about the LIAR dataset or the reasons it may be considered difficult for fact-checking tasks. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the available information.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: and intractable when done manually. This work presents Aletheia, an automated fact-checking prototype designed to facilitate data claims verification and enhance data evidence communication. For verification, we utilize a pre-trained LLM to parse the semantics for evidence retrieval. To effectively communicate the data evidence, we design representations in two forms: data tables and visualizations, tailored to various data fact types. Additionally, we design interactions that showcase a real-world application of these techniques. We evaluate the performance of two core NLP tasks with a curated dataset comprising 400 data claims and compare the two representation forms regarding viewers’ assessment time, confidence, and preference via a user study with 20 participants. The evaluation offers insights into the feasibility and bottlenecks of using LLMs for data fact-checking tasks, potential advantages and disadvantages of using visualizations over data tables, and design recommendations

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: Gorwa et al. (2020).Additionally, there are several existing challenges in building models to detect undesired content, including the difficulty in designing taxonomy for undesired content, the time-consuming nature of data labeling, and the inadequacy of academic datasets in revealing the real-world data distribution Markov et al. (2023).Research Directions.1.Detecting and debunking online misinformation. Misleading content on the internet is growing in abundance, and an increase in volume in the upcoming years due to the rise in popularity of AI generated content is likely unavoidable. NLP can be used on several fronts to slow down the spread of misleading content. In the interest of extending help to fact-checkers and journalists, NLP systems remain underutilized, leaving a golden opportunity for building fact-checking technology that empowers fact-checkers to scale up their efforts Kazemi et al. (2022). Additionally, NLP assisted fact-checking is often built in English,
