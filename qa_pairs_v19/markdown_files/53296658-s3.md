## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The challenges associated with using the LIAR dataset for fact-checking stem from several factors intrinsic to both the nature of the dataset and the complexities involved in processing and evaluating claims. 

Firstly, while the LIAR dataset contains a substantial number of short statements—12,836 labeled for truthfulness—this dataset is also representative of a broader issues related to the inherent variability and evolution of political language. Specifically, trends associated with speakers and context might shift over time, which can adversely affect the long-term performance of models trained on this data. This variability poses a challenge for sustaining accurate predictions as linguistic styles and public sentiments evolve [1].

Additionally, despite the well-balanced nature of the labeled categories (True, Mostly True, Half True, Barely True, False, and Pants on Fire), the "Pants on Fire" category is significantly underrepresented with only 1,050 instances, which may limit the model's ability to learn effectively from this specific category due to insufficient examples [1]. Furthermore, the lack of a manually labeled fake news dataset has been noted as a significant bottleneck in advancing models designed for computational assessments in this field. Previous datasets, including the one released by Vlachos and Riedel (2014), were very limited in scale, which adds to the complexity of developing robust machine learning models capable of generalization [3][4].

Moreover, while meta-data augmentation has shown promise, integrating text with meta-information (like the speaker’s party affiliation or the context of the statement) presents its own challenges. Such meta-data can evolve, introducing new trends that might confuse models that rely on fixed historical patterns. In the study, it was mentioned that the most successful hybrid-CNN model achieved an accuracy of only 0.274 on the test dataset, indicating that significant room for improvement exists in leveraging both types of information effectively [5].

Another challenge arises from the problem of detecting false statements in the context of diverse communication modalities, including political debates, social media posts, and interviews, all of which can vary widely in style and tone. Deceptive language in politics is often nuanced and context-dependent, making it more difficult to detect compared to more straightforward categories like deceptive product reviews [3][4]. For instance, the necessity to appraise linguistic or stylometric features means that actors (e.g., politicians) may modify their speech patterns over time to evade detection, further complicating the verification process [5].

In conclusion, the LIAR dataset, while comprehensive, faces significant challenges that stem from temporal context shifts, class imbalance, the need for robust integration of diverse information types, and the inherently complex nature of political discourse. These issues create hurdles for the development of generalized and accurate models for fact-checking [1][2][3][4][5].

However, using author or context information introduces a challenge, as trends related to the speaker and context may change over time, thereby affecting the model’s long-term performance. We will use the same LIAR dataset and benchmarks to evaluate our model’s performance.3 DatasetThe experiments were conducted on the LIAR dataset ([14]). The dataset contains 12,836 short statements extracted from PolitiFact, a well-known fact-checking website in the United States. These statements were labeled by PolitiFact staff as True, Mostly True, Half True, Barely True, False, or Pants on Fire, according to their truthfulness. The distribution of the six labels is relatively well-balanced, with the exception of the ’Pants on Fire’ category, which contains 1,050 instances. The label distribution is shown in Figure 1. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets using an 80/10/10 split. The

This work presents Aletheia, an automated fact-checking prototype designed to facilitate data claims verification and enhance data evidence communication. For verification, we utilize a pre-trained LLM to parse the semantics for evidence retrieval. To effectively communicate the data evidence, we design representations in two forms: data tables and visualizations, tailored to various data fact types. Additionally, we design interactions that showcase a real-world application of these techniques. We evaluate the performance of two core NLP tasks with a curated dataset comprising 400 data claims and compare the two representation forms regarding viewers’ assessment time, confidence, and preference via a user study with 20 participants. The evaluation offers insights into the feasibility and bottlenecks of using LLMs for data fact-checking tasks, potential advantages and disadvantages of using visualizations over data tables, and design recommendations
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: detection is more challenging than detecting deceptive reviews,since the political language on TV interviews, posts on Facebook and Twitters are mostly short statements. However, the lack of manually labeled fake news dataset is still a bottleneck for advancing computational-intensive, broad-coverage models in this direction. Vlachos and Riedel Vlachos and Riedel (2014) are the first to release a public fake news detection and fact-checking dataset, but it only includes 221 statements, which does not permit machine learning based assessments.To address these issues, we introduce the liar dataset, which includes 12,836 short statements labeled for truthfulness, subject, context/venue, speaker, state, party, and prior history. With such volume and a time span of a decade, liar is an order of magnitude larger than the currently available resources Vlachos and Riedel (2014); Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) of similiar type. Additionally, in contrast to crowdsourced datasets, the instances

Additionally, in contrast to crowdsourced datasets, the instances in liar are collected in a grounded, more natural context, such as political debate, TV ads, Facebook posts, tweets, interview, news release, etc. In each case, the labeler provides a lengthy analysis report to ground each judgment, and the links to all supporting documents are also provided.Empirically, we have evaluated several popular learning based methods on this dataset. The baselines include logistic regression, support vector machines, long short-term memory networks Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), and a convolutional neural network model Kim (2014). We further introduce a neural network architecture to integrate text and meta-data.Our experiment suggests that this approach improves the performance of a strong text-only convolutional neural networks baseline.Statement:

However, one of the challenges with using linguistic or stylometric features to detect false statements is that actors may adapt to these detection methods, making it necessary to evaluate the truth value of a statement solely based on the facts.Meta-data augmentation The LIAR dataset, constructed by William Yang Wang ([14]) using Politifact data, served as the basis for the development of several benchmark models. Both text and meta-information, including the speaker, the speaker’s party affiliation, the location of the statement, and its context, were employed as predictive features. The most successful model was a hybrid-CNN model that utilized both text and meta-information, achieving an accuracy of 0.274 on the test dataset. Meta-data played a significant role in prediction, leading to substantial improvements when combined with text. However, using author or context information introduces a challenge, as trends related to the speaker and context may change
