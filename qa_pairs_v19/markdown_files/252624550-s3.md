## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any information about the challenges and solutions regarding the use of XML for extracting interlinear glossed text data. The passages focus primarily on general concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as text understanding, information extraction, the role of large language models, and questions around existing NLP techniques, but they do not specifically address XML or interlinear glossed text data. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your question based on the given context.

[1]: Passage ID 1: data lacks a predefined format, posing significant challenges for traditional data processing methodologies. Consequently, organizations must employ advanced text understanding and information extraction techniques to analyze and extract meaningful insights from this data effectively.Text understanding and information extraction are key tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automatically processing data from unstructured text documents.The rise of Transformer architectures and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) opens new perspectives for extracting and structuring information from vast amounts of natural language texts [5].One main aspect deals with Knowledge graphs (KGs) construction. KGs structure representations of knowledge by capturing relationships between entities and hold considerable advantages in analyzing text data collections and inferring knowledge from structured heterogeneous data. For instance, KGs can merge diverse data from multiple sources,
[2]: Passage ID 2: user can ask: Which text processing task does this technique support? What are the alternative techniques for the same task? From Table IV, the user can ask: What level of language analysis does this technique provide? What are the techniques for performing other levels of analysis? The answers to these questions can help the user to decide if a specific technique is relevant to the task at hand.Our future work will improve this knowledge base as follows:•To show the relationship between a given technique and other techniques. For example, for text normalization, what techniques can I use together? in what order? For text representation, which technique is better for my case?•To provide information on the available NLP tools that support each technique.References[1]K. Ryan, “The role of natural language in requirements engineering,” in[1993] Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on RequirementsEngineering.   IEEE, 1993,
[3]: Passage ID 3: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
[4]: Passage ID 4: summaries.Data-to-Text NLGData-to-Text Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on converting structured data into coherent and readable narrative text. This task is crucial in making data accessible and understandable to a broader audience, transcending the barriers of technical expertise. The significance of Data-to-Text NLG lies in its ability to bridge the gap between raw data and human communication, allowing for effective data-driven storytelling and reporting.Large Language Models (LLMs) approach Data-to-Text NLG through various methodologies. Krause et al. (2023) design a waterfallprompting technique using a combination ofboth GPT-3 and ChatGPT to enhance Data-to-Text response generation. Li et al. (2023b) use LLMs for synthetic conversation generation to tackle the data deficiency problem in training information-seeking conversation models.Open-ended and Conditional GenerationOpen-ended and conditional generation
[5]: Passage ID 5: or Bing, use web crawlers to gather documents and create a massive index of these documents by noting which words occur in which document, and answer queries by identifying documents that contains these keywords. Then it uses intelligent ranking algorithms (like PageRank) to put most likely ones at the top (i.e. in decreasing order). But still these search engines have limitations as they provide only documents and no specific answer to the query. Moreover, IR systems are still keyword (string matching)based. To overcome these limitations, NLP research community has moved towards integrating Information Extraction technology with Information Retrieval technology to make search engines more reliable, accurate, specific to user queries and having high semantic understanding. Though, user queries can be answered as a Question-Answering problem where we can provide direct answer to user queries, but in order to accomplish this goal, we need highly structured Knowledge Base and better
