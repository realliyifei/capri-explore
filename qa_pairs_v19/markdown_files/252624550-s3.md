## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

The context provided does not directly address the specific challenges and solutions associated with using XML for extracting interlinear glossed text (IGT) data. While it discusses various aspects of interlinear glossing systems, machine translation, and the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there is no mention of XML technologies as used or applied to IGT extraction.

Although [1] mentions the use of XML technologies for encoding and presenting interlinear text, it does not elaborate on any specific challenges or solutions that arise from this approach. Therefore, this passage does not provide sufficient detail to give a comprehensive answer regarding XML’s role in extracting IGT data.

Moreover, while passages [2], [3], and [4] discuss the challenges of generating IGT, such as the scarcity of labeled data and the dependence of models on large training datasets, they focus more on the performance of models and do not specifically connect these challenges to XML or how XML might facilitate or hinder the extraction of IGT data.

In light of this absence of information on XML-related challenges or solutions, I conclude that I do not have enough information to address your question about the challenges and solutions in using XML for extracting interlinear glossed text data.

2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: We seek to evaluate the ability of current LLMs to generate interlinear glossed text, compared with earlier state-of-the-art methods. This research can also shed light on the language-agnostic capabilities of LLMs, requiring the model to learn patterns in very rare languages which are unlikely to have significant presence in their training data.We study strategies for selecting in-context examples, finding significant impacts to performance. Our best-performing systems outperform transformer model baselines, despite involving no training whatsoever. They still underperform SOTA systems that induce morphological segmentation, but at the same time hold promise for offering a new approach to interlinear glossing for language documentation practitioners.2 Background2.1 Interlinear Glosed TextA typical example of IGT is shown in subsection 2.1.{exe}\ex\gllnuhu’ tih-’eeneti-3i’ heneenei3oobei-3i’ this when.PAST-speak-3PL IC.tell.the.truth-3PL \glt“When they speak, they

Research has explored methods to overcome this challenge for IGT generation systems, such as crosslingual transfer (He et al., 2023; Okabe and Yvon, 2023; Ginn et al., 2024) and architectural modifications (Girrbach, 2023a), but these approaches struggle in very low-resource scenarios.In addition, previous approaches generally require expertise in model training, implementation, and deployment, as well as the computational resources needed to serve large neural models.As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on various natural language tasks, the question arises whether they can benefit language documentation. We seek to evaluate the ability of current LLMs to generate interlinear glossed text, compared with earlier state-of-the-art methods. This research can also shed light on the language-agnostic

IGT generation has been studied using statistical (Palmer et al., 2009; Samardžić et al., 2015; McMillan-Major, 2020) and neural (Moeller and Hulden, 2018; Zhao et al., 2020; Barriga Martínez et al., 2021) methods.A key challenge when working with endangered languages is that, in nearly all cases,111As Liu et al. (2022) notes, not all endangered languages are low-resource (and vice versa), and such languages bear different concerns when developing language technology. there is very little labeled or unlabeled data available. This is particularly challenging for large neural models which depend on large, representative training data sets. Research has explored methods to overcome this challenge
