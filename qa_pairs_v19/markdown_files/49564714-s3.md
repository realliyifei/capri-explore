In the context of dependency parsing, various methods have been developed to facilitate language transfer, particularly through the use of cross-lingual transfer techniques. These methods primarily address the challenge posed by low-resource languages, which often lack sufficient labeled data essential for effective NLP applications.

One of the core approaches in cross-lingual transfer is **direct transfer**. This method involves training a dependency parser on labeled data from a high-resource source language and then applying that parser directly to a target low-resource language. This approach is particularly appealing as it does not require any labeled data from the target language itself, thereby simplifying the transfer process [4] [5].

Additionally, cross-lingual transfer learning encompasses a broader range of techniques, which include leveraging models and representations that have demonstrated effectiveness across multiple languages. Recent advancements have shown notable improvements in dependency parsing through this method, aided by frameworks such as **Universal Dependencies (UD)**, which provides standardized annotation guidelines and freely available corpora across over 100 languages [2] [3]. This framework enhances the ability to implement syntactic parsing methodologies consistently across different linguistic contexts.

Furthermore, the paper under discussion proposes a flexible framework for cross-lingual transfer that can utilize any pre-trained arc-factored dependency parser. This flexibility helps in adapting existing high-resource language models to low-resource targets without needing labeled data from the target languages [4] [5]. The approach capitalizes on the rich representations learned from high-resource languages to inform parsing in languages where data is scarce.

Overall, the combination of direct transfer and frameworks like UD illustrates the evolving methodologies aimed at improving the accessibility and effectiveness of NLP tools for diverse languages through cross-lingual transfer learning [1] [2] [4]. These advancements are critical for overcoming the barriers imposed by limited labeled datasets in many languages, which in turn supports more equitable access to NLP technologies [4] [5].

(2017), dependency parsing Ma and Xia (2014), named entity recognition Xie et al. (2018), entity linking Sil et al. (2018), coreference resolution Kundu et al. (2018), and question answering Joty et al. (2017).Noteworthy improvements are achieved on low resource language applications due to cross-lingual transfer learning.In this paper, we study cross-lingual transfer for dependency parsing. A dependency parser consists of (1) an encoder that transforms an input text sequence into latent representations and (2) a decoding algorithm that generates the corresponding parse tree.In cross-lingual transfer, most recent approaches assume that the inputs from different

For this purpose, two main kinds of representations are used in NLP: constituent parsing, where the sentence is recursively divided into smaller units, and dependency parsing, which focuses on representing relations between words. While constituent parsing has seen some use in sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), dependency parsing is the dominant alternative for the task, as it straightforwardly represents what words are modified by other words. In particular, it is the basis of all the methods based on syntactic rules cited in the previous section.In the last few years, Universal Dependencies (UD) (Zeman et al., 2023) has become the predominant framework for dependency parsing, especially in multilingual setups, as it provides harmonized annotation guidelines and freely-available corpora for over 100 diverse languages.Syntactic parsing within UD involves the analysis of the grammatical structure of sentences to determinethe roles of each of their parts and the
