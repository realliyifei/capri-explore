## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Morphological analyzers play a crucial role in subword segmentation for low-resource languages (LRLs) by facilitating a more nuanced tokenization that captures the complex morphological structures inherent in these languages. Traditional subword tokenization techniques like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) often fall short in accurately modeling the rich morphology of such languages, as they primarily focus on surface forms of words and can miss morphemes— the smallest meaningful units of language. This limitation becomes pronounced in morphologically rich languages where morphological variations and patterns are more prominent [1][5].

In the context of low-resource neural machine translation (NMT), it has been observed that integrating morphological modeling through analyzers can improve the efficacy of machine translation systems. Morphological analyzers help convert sentences into morphemes, which allows NMT models to better comprehend the meaning and structure of LRLs [3][4]. For example, the LingoLLM system utilizes morphological analysis to preprocess sentences before translation. This preprocessing aims to address the realities of endangered languages that are often completely omitted from the training datasets of language models [3].

Research indicates that methodologies implementing morphological segmentation methods outperformed traditional BPE approaches, especially when assessed on machine translation and morphological segmentation tasks in various low-resource languages [2]. Mager et al. (2022) found that specific morphological segmentation techniques, including statistical methods, provided better results compared to BPE in their evaluations of different models across four low-resource languages [2]. 

Moreover, the application of subword information has proven effective in advancing cross-lingual word embeddings for LRLs, allowing for shared representations that can handle inflectional languages with limited data [4]. By leveraging morphological similarities across languages, subword-level models can learn connections between related words that differ in surface form. This indicates that morphological analyzers not only improve tokenization but also enhance the model’s ability to generalize and perform better in cross-lingual scenarios [4].

Given the promising results seen when employing morphological models, future research and practical applications are encouraged to expand on these findings. The integration of such models into conventional workflows of NMT and larger language models may yield significant improvements in translation quality and overall understanding of linguistically diverse datasets. As NLP technologies continue to evolve, the ongoing exploration of morphological analysis will likely remain crucial in the pursuit of better linguistic representation in low-resource settings [1][5].

In conclusion, morphological analyzers significantly enhance subword segmentation in LRLs by providing a deeper understanding of the underlying morphologies, which in turn improves the performance of NMT systems and enriches cross-lingual applications [1][2][4].

Here people come across the question, whether we can build a more data efficient language model, so that it can achieve relatively good performance with a smaller data consumption. With a data efficient LM, it is easier for people to explore the influence of subword tokenization, as a small size of training data is more sensitive to the method of tokenization.This paper describes my submission to the SIGMORPHON 2024 Subword Tokenization shared task. Participants are asked to develop a subword tokenization system and use it to pretrain a language model on the 100M word tokens dataset from the BabyLM challenge (Warstadt et al., 2023). The performance of pretrained model is evaluated by model’s predictions after fine-tuning it on three different subtasks: Word and Definition, Word and Morphology and Word and Word. In this paper, I introduce two subword tokenization systems with their variants: one based on a statistics-based morphological

Mager et al. (2022) compared the performance of different morphological segmentation methods with the BPE in four low-resource languages on machine translation and morphological segmentation tasks. They tested both unsupervised methods and supervised methods. They found that both of them outperform the BPE in the task of

(2023) evaluated ChatGPT’s machine translation performance on 204 languages and found that ChatGPT consistently underperforms traditional machine translation models on low-resource languages.Ahuja et al. (2023) evaluated several LLMs on 16 NLP tasks and found significant performance drops on low-resource languages.While their conclusions corroborate our motivation, the languages they evaluate are very likely to exist in LLMs’ training set, as indicated by LLMs’ significantly positive performance in the zero-shot setting.On the contrary, the focus of our paper is on endangered languages that are truly extinct in the training data with near-zero performance from LLMs.Figure 3: LingoLLM uses a morphological analyzer to transform the source sentence into morphemes,

By capturing morphological similarities across languages, subword-level models can learn shared representations for morphologically related words, even when they exhibit different surface forms. [27] explored universal and language-specific properties within word embeddings, revealing that word form features are particularly beneficial for inflectional languages. Similarly, [28] examined cross-lingual word embeddings derived from bilingual lexicons to enhance language models for low-resource languages. Applying this approach to Yongning Na, they highlighted challenges and potential solutions for low-resource settings.Furthermore, [29] developed a language-agnostic BERT model,

Two important innovations in recent state-of-the-art NMT systems are the use of the Transformer architecture Vaswani et al. (2017) and sub-word tokenization methods such as byte-pair encoding (BPE) Sennrich et al. (2016). However, for morphologically-rich languages(MRLs), BPE-based tokenization is only limited to the surface forms of the words and less grounded on exact lexical units (i.e. morphemes), especially in the presence morphographemic alternations Bundy and Wallen (1984) and non-concatenative morphology Kastner et al. (2019). In this work, we tackle the challenge of modeling complex morphology in low-resource NMT and
