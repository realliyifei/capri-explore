## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Evaluating extracted fragments in Information Extraction (IE) systems faces several challenges, primarily due to the nature of the data being processed and the various forms of representation involved.

1. **Complexity of Relationships**: One significant challenge is the handling of complex and n-ary relationships in the data. Current IE technologies, such as OpenIE, must extend their capabilities to effectively address these complexities, which involve multiple entities and relationships within a single piece of information [2][3]. Additionally, the system must discern between different types of information, including facts, opinions, and misinformation, particularly prevalent on the web [3].

2. **Language Variability**: The informal and inconsistent language found in social media presents a considerable hurdle. Extracting meaningful fragments from such unstructured text is challenging due to the use of abbreviations, spelling variations, and relaxed grammar rules [2]. This variability can lead to difficulties in accurately tagging and categorizing information, resulting in potential errors in the extracted data.

3. **Temporal Changes in Information**: Managing temporally changing information—data that evolves over time—adds further complexity to evaluation processes in IE systems. The ability to distinguish when certain facts or contexts change, and to accurately capture these shifts, is crucial for applications that rely on real-time information [3]. This requires IE systems to not only extract data but also maintain a temporal context which can be inherently complicated.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: There is also a lack of widely accepted evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of extracted information. The effectiveness of an IE system can depend on diverse dimensions such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which can be challenging to compute accurately, especially when multiple sub-tasks (like Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction) are integrated [4]. Differences in what constitutes a "correct" extraction can lead to inconsistencies in evaluation outcomes.

5. **Integration with Other NLP Tasks**: The integration of IE with other high-level NLP tasks, such as summarization and natural language understanding, introduces additional layers of complexity. For instance, when extracted information is used for summarization, the efficacy of the summarization depends on the accuracy and relevancy of the information extracted [3][4]. This interdependency complicates the evaluation process, as errors in extraction can compound across tasks, affecting overall system performance.

6. **Biomedical Text Challenges**: Finally, specialized domains such as biomedical text introduce unique challenges that standard IE techniques may struggle with. The specific jargon and formatting found in biomedical literature require tailored approaches to IE, which complicates evaluation efforts since standard evaluation benchmarks may not be applicable [3].

In conclusion, evaluating extracted fragments in IE systems is a multi-faceted challenge that encompasses relationship complexity, language variability, temporal dynamics, effective evaluation metrics, task integration, and specific domain issues. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing the accuracy and usability of IE technologies in diverse applications.

Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Information Extraction (IE) refers to the use of computational methods to identify relevant pieces of information in document generated for human use and convert this information into a representation suitable for computer based storage, processing, and retrieval (Wimalasuriya and Dua, 2010). The input to IE system is a collection of documents (email, web pages, news groups, news articles, business reports, research papers, blogs, resumes,

Social media reacts to world events faster than traditional news sources, and its sub-communities play close attention to topics that other sources might ignore. But analyzing the text in social media is challenging as the text is short, language is informal, capitalization is inconsistent, spelling variations and abbreviations run rampant. Moreover, research is shifting towards joint models that learn two or more tasks. McCallum et al., 2003 proposed joint POS tagging and chunking, Finkel and Manning, 2009 proposed joint model for parsing and NER together, Yu et al., 2011 worked on jointly

Current challenges includes extending the capability of OpenIE to handle n-ary relations and even nested extractions, dealing with multiple languages, extraction of temporarily changing information and to distinguish between facts, opinions and misinformation on the web. Moreover, research is in the direction of integrating IE and summarization. IE extracts important information in the form of named entities, events, relations, and then this information is fed to summarization template which provides summary of the actual text.7.2 BioIEThough lot of progress has been made in NLP to handle common unstructured text, less attention has been given to bio-medical text. Bio-medical text in the form of patient discharge summaries, doctor’s prescriptions, scientific publications provides various challenges to standard IE techniques. Hence, BioIE is important to various applications in healthcare industry including clinical

Then it uses intelligent ranking algorithms (like PageRank) to put most likely ones at the top (i.e. in decreasing order). But still these search engines have limitations as they provide only documents and no specific answer to the query. Moreover, IR systems are still keyword (string matching)based. To overcome these limitations, NLP research community has moved towards integrating Information Extraction technology with Information Retrieval technology to make search engines more reliable, accurate, specific to user queries and having high semantic understanding. Though, user queries can be answered as a Question-Answering problem where we can provide direct answer to user queries, but in order to accomplish this goal, we need highly structured Knowledge Base and better
