## Answer

## I don't know?: False

In evaluating extracted fragments in Information Extraction (IE) systems, several challenges arise, primarily due to the complexities inherent in the content being processed, as well as the methodologies employed in extraction.

One of the main challenges is dealing with the informal and often chaotic nature of social media text. Social media platforms produce content that is usually short, informal, and replete with issues such as inconsistent capitalization, spelling variations, and abbreviations. This informal nature can complicate the extraction process as traditional IE techniques may not be well-suited to handle such variations effectively [2]. Furthermore, the contextual relevance of information can shift rapidly on social media, making it harder to evaluate the significance of extracted fragments in a time-sensitive manner.

Another significant challenge lies in the nature of the information being extracted. Extracting accurate fragments requires distinguishing between facts, opinions, and misinformation, particularly on large platforms where all three types can coexist. This necessitates advanced analytical capabilities to correctly categorize and evaluate the extracted information [3]. 

Furthermore, there is the inherent complexity of n-ary relations and nested extractions. Extending Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) systems to handle complex relationships between entities and to sustain accuracy despite nested structures remains a technical hurdle. Current techniques often struggle to adequately model the rich, multilayered nature of the information present in documents and data sources [3].

In addition, challenges arise from the need for integration between different NLP tasks. For instance, merging Information Extraction with summarization adds complications in evaluating fragments since the extracted information must not only be accurate but also relevant and concise enough to fit into a predefined summary structure [3]. This interconnectedness means that the quality and reliability of extracted information directly impact downstream applications, highlighting the need for integrated evaluation metrics.

Finally, the shift towards multilingual extraction adds another layer of complexity. Evaluating extracted fragments across languages necessitates different standards and techniques, complicating the establishment of universal evaluation criteria. Existing systems may not be optimized for the nuances of various languages, leading to discrepancies in extraction efficacy [3].

In summary, evaluating extracted fragments in IE systems is fraught with challenges related to informal text characteristics from social media, the need to discern different types of information accurately, the complexity of relationships in data, integrations across various NLP tasks, and the multilingual nature of contemporary data sources. Each of these challenges necessitates ongoing research and development to improve the robustness and accuracy of extraction methodologies [1] [4].

Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Information Extraction (IE) refers to the use of computational methods to identify relevant pieces of information in document generated for human use and convert this information into a representation suitable for computer based storage, processing, and retrieval (Wimalasuriya and Dua, 2010). The input to IE system is a collection of documents (email, web pages, news groups, news articles, business reports, research papers, blogs, resumes,

Social media reacts to world events faster than traditional news sources, and its sub-communities play close attention to topics that other sources might ignore. But analyzing the text in social media is challenging as the text is short, language is informal, capitalization is inconsistent, spelling variations and abbreviations run rampant. Moreover, research is shifting towards joint models that learn two or more tasks.

Current challenges includes extending the capability of OpenIE to handle n-ary relations and even nested extractions, dealing with multiple languages, extraction of temporarily changing information and to distinguish between facts, opinions and misinformation on the web. Moreover, research is in the direction of integrating IE and summarization. IE extracts important information in the form of named entities, events, relations, and then this information is fed to summarization template which provides summary of the actual text.7.2 BioIEThough lot of progress has been made in NLP to handle common unstructured text, less attention has been given to bio-medical text.

Then it uses intelligent ranking algorithms (like PageRank) to put most likely ones at the top (i.e. in decreasing order). But still these search engines have limitations as they provide only documents and no specific answer to the query. Moreover, IR systems are still keyword (string matching)based. To overcome these limitations, NLP research community has moved towards integrating Information Extraction technology with Information Retrieval technology to make search engines more reliable, accurate, specific to user queries and having high semantic understanding. Though, user queries can be answered as a Question-Answering problem where we can provide direct answer to user queries, but in order to accomplish this goal, we need highly structured Knowledge Base and better
