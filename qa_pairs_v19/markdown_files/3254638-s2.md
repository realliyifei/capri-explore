## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Evaluating extracted fragments in Information Extraction (IE) systems presents several challenges, which are highlighted across various passages. 

Firstly, one significant challenge is the need to manage and distinguish between various types of information. Systems like Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) face difficulties in handling n-ary relations and nested extractions, which complicates the evaluation of how effectively the system captures complex relationships within the data [3]. Additionally, there is an inherent difficulty in discerning between facts, opinions, and misinformation on platforms like the web, which poses a significant challenge to the integrity of the extracted information [3]. 

Another challenge arises from the informal and unstructured nature of the text commonly found in social media environments. Analyzing such text is problematic due to its brevity, inconsistent capitalization, numerous spelling variations, and rampant use of abbreviations [2]. These elements can lead to inaccuracies in both the extraction process and subsequent evaluations of the information extracted.

Furthermore, the integration of IE and summarization routines faces challenges in ensuring that the extracted named entities, events, and relations are accurately represented in the final summary of the text. If the extraction does not correctly capture the nuances of the original content, the summarization will likely be flawed, complicating the evaluation of both processes [3].

Moreover, the dynamic nature of information, particularly in bio-medical texts where details such as patient conditions can change rapidly, adds another layer of complexity. Standard IE techniques may struggle to accommodate these temporary changes, which complicates the evaluation of the relevance and timeliness of the extracted information [3].

Another aspect involves the integration of IE with Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Current search engines mainly rely on keyword matching, and the limitations of this approach can hinder the evaluator's ability to ascertain the quality of the extracted information in terms of relevance, specificity, and semantic understanding [5]. The lack of highly structured databases for direct question-answering adds to the evaluative challenges faced by these systems [5].

In summary, the challenges in evaluating extracted fragments from IE systems are multifaceted, involving the complexity of relationships being extracted, the informal nature of the text, the necessity to distinguish types of information, and the integration with summarization and retrieval systems. Each of these factors contributes to the difficulties in assessing the accuracy, relevance, and utility of the information provided by IE technologies.

Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Information Extraction (IE) refers to the use of computational methods to identify relevant pieces of information in document generated for human use and convert this information into a representation suitable for computer based storage, processing, and retrieval (Wimalasuriya and Dua, 2010). The input to IE system is a collection of documents (email, web pages, news groups, news articles, business reports, research papers, blogs, resumes,

Social media reacts to world events faster than traditional news sources, and its sub-communities play close attention to topics that other sources might ignore. But analyzing the text in social media is challenging as the text is short, language is informal, capitalization is inconsistent, spelling variations and abbreviations run rampant. Moreover, research is shifting towards joint models that learn two or more tasks. McCallum et al., 2003 proposed joint POS tagging and chunking, Finkel and Manning, 2009 proposed joint model for parsing and NER together, Yu et al., 2011 worked on jointly

Current challenges includes extending the capability of OpenIE to handle n-ary relations and even nested extractions, dealing with multiple languages, extraction of temporarily changing information and to distinguish between facts, opinions and misinformation on the web. Moreover, research is in the direction of integrating IE and summarization. IE extracts important information in the form of named entities, events, relations, and then this information is fed to summarization template which provides summary of the actual text.7.2 BioIEThough lot of progress has been made in NLP to handle common unstructured text, less attention has been given to bio-medical text. Bio-medical text in the form of patient discharge summaries, doctor’s prescriptions, scientific publications provides various challenges to standard IE techniques. Hence, BioIE is important to various applications in healthcare industry including clinical

Various sub-tasks of IE such as Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, Relation Extraction, Knowledge Base reasoning forms the building blocks of various high end Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Machine Translation, Question-Answering System, Natural Language Understanding, Text Summarization and Digital Assistants like Siri, Cortana and Google Now. This paper introduces Information Extraction technology, its various sub-tasks, highlights state-of-the-art research in various IE subtasks, current challenges and future research directions.1 Introduction to Information ExtractionData is now a kind of capital, on par with financial and human capital in creating new digital products and services.

Then it uses intelligent ranking algorithms (like PageRank) to put most likely ones at the top (i.e. in decreasing order). But still these search engines have limitations as they provide only documents and no specific answer to the query. Moreover, IR systems are still keyword (string matching)based. To overcome these limitations, NLP research community has moved towards integrating Information Extraction technology with Information Retrieval technology to make search engines more reliable, accurate, specific to user queries and having high semantic understanding. Though, user queries can be answered as a Question-Answering problem where we can provide direct answer to user queries, but in order to accomplish this goal, we need highly structured Knowledge Base and better
