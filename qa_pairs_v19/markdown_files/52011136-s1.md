## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided is insufficient to answer the question regarding the key elements involved in annotating negation in English and how these differ from the approach used for Spanish. While the context discusses various aspects of negation detection in English using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including methodologies and challenges faced by different models, it does not specifically address the key elements of annotating negation in English or provide comparative insights into the Spanish approach to negation annotation. Furthermore, it lacks detailed information or examples specific to Spanish negation practices or linguistic features relevant to that language. Without these details, a precise answer cannot be constructed.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: tool, we answered the following two questions:•RQ1: How do we detect negation in a given text?•RQ2: How can a automated system apply negation to appropriate words to improve sentiment analysis?NLP was used mainly because it guides the extraction of information from texts in their natural form. The most frequent lexicon-based technique for negation is to reverse the polarity of the object that is affected by the negator in a sentence (Jurek et al., 2015). This study presents an alternative approach by developing a disambiguation function that can be used to average out the polarity scores of the negated word antonyms using five dictionaries. Beyond sentiment detection, we propose using antonyms to construct a human-readable semantic construction of the entire sentence, taking a context-based approach into consideration. First, detecting negation in a sentence requires the use of an automated decontraction system, as some negations may be in contraction mode e.g.,
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: The trick here is also that tokens are read at the same time and not in order (either left-to-right or right-to-left). This allows BERT to take the context of each word into account. Similar in its construction, XLNet (Topal et al., 2021) improved its masking mechanism with peculiar assumptions during its pre-training stage, and improved over the work done by BERT. Despite these advances, studies (Ettinger, 2020) have shown that even these approaches have still struggled with negation. Which is why this study aims to examine the problem in a holistic manner.3. MethodologyThis paper addressed two research problems by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, a lexicon-based approach, and sequence labeling. To guide the design of the aforementioned automated tool, we answered the following two questions:•RQ1: How do we detect negation in a given text?•RQ2: How can a automated system apply negation to appropriate words to improve sentiment
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: 2019). The applicability of NLP comes in a variety of forms. In our everyday discourse, such as social media conversations, negation signals are employed. In practice, some NLP techniques used in this space are Word2Vec and GloVe (Yu et al., 2017). BERT and XLNet deliver state-of-the-art outcomes as well (Devlin et al., 2018). However, each model has its own set of constraints. Most algorithms underperform when confronted with negation, which is why it is critical to identify novel approaches to overcome this issue in the NLP domain.2.5. Word Negation and Sequence LabelingThe accuracy of NLP models such as sentiment or perception analysis depends on word negation and sequence labeling. Some NLP models typically work by analyzing each word, or sequence of words, independently. These algorithms deconstruct text into its minimum units called tokens (Webster and Kit, 1992). Once these tokens have been cleaned up, the algorithms read each word or tokenized entity independently and
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Computing methodologies Natural language processing1. IntroductionNegation is an inescapable variable when it comes to human communication. To convey spoken words or written texts, negations need not to be neglected because they are integral to everyday expression (Coombs, 2015; Ifeanyi et al., 2014). Popular text mining techniques have been studied over the years as to how they can automatically detect emotions, attitudes, sentiments, and perceptions, to name a few (Jiao and Qu, 2019). Some notable features that have received less attention in text analysis are negations and multiple negatives (Baker, 1969). As a result, the overall accuracy of popular sentiment analyzers has decreased. Understanding negation cues is essential for looping every word in a sentence together and capturing the elements that were affected.The term ”negation” is a linguistic feature that negates the meaning of its closest neighbor in a sentence; i.e., it is the semantic opposite of a phenomenon
