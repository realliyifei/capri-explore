## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

To annotate negation in English, key elements include the detection of negation cues, understanding their scope, and the application of this understanding to improve sentiment analysis. Negation cues are linguistic elements (like "not" or "never") that negate the meaning of words or phrases in their vicinity, thereby changing the overall sentiment expressed in a sentence. Research highlights that understanding these cues is essential as they affect the interpretation of emotions, attitudes, and sentiments in text [4]. Traditional NLP models often struggle with negation, leading to a decrease in accuracy for sentiment analysis when negations are present [3][4].

The methodology for annotating negation typically involves utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, which can include lexicon-based approaches and sequence labeling. Lexicon-based techniques often reverse the polarity of targets affected by negations, while sequence labeling aims to recognize and classify tokens within a given context [1][2]. Moreover, state-of-the-art models like BERT and XLNet have been noted for their capabilities, but they also encounter challenges when it comes to negation, underscoring the necessity for novel approaches in this area [2][3].

In contrast, the approach to negation annotation in Spanish also encompasses similar requirements, such as identifying negation cues and their scope. However, the specifics can differ based on linguistic nuances and resources available for the language. For example, there are several Spanish corpora dedicated to annotating negation within clinical texts, which focus not only on negation but also on uncertainty [5]. The IxaMed-GS and the UHU-HUVR corpora highlight contextual negation in medical texts, encompassing the nuances of events being characterized as negated or speculated. This aspect may not be as prevalent in English annotations, which tend to stick closely to straightforward negation detection.

Ultimately, while the core concepts of annotating negation—like identifying cues and understanding their semantic impact—are similar across both languages, the methodologies, available corpora, and the focus on uncertainty in Spanish reflect significant differences in how negation is handled within these linguistic contexts [5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: tool, we answered the following two questions:•RQ1: How do we detect negation in a given text?•RQ2: How can a automated system apply negation to appropriate words to improve sentiment analysis?NLP was used mainly because it guides the extraction of information from texts in their natural form. The most frequent lexicon-based technique for negation is to reverse the polarity of the object that is affected by the negator in a sentence (Jurek et al., 2015). This study presents an alternative approach by developing a disambiguation function that can be used to average out the polarity scores of the negated word antonyms using five dictionaries. Beyond sentiment detection, we propose using antonyms to construct a human-readable semantic construction of the entire sentence, taking a context-based approach into consideration. First, detecting negation in a sentence requires the use of an automated decontraction system, as some negations may be in contraction mode e.g.,
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: The trick here is also that tokens are read at the same time and not in order (either left-to-right or right-to-left). This allows BERT to take the context of each word into account. Similar in its construction, XLNet (Topal et al., 2021) improved its masking mechanism with peculiar assumptions during its pre-training stage, and improved over the work done by BERT. Despite these advances, studies (Ettinger, 2020) have shown that even these approaches have still struggled with negation. Which is why this study aims to examine the problem in a holistic manner.3. MethodologyThis paper addressed two research problems by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, a lexicon-based approach, and sequence labeling. To guide the design of the aforementioned automated tool, we answered the following two questions:•RQ1: How do we detect negation in a given text?•RQ2: How can a automated system apply negation to appropriate words to improve sentiment
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: 2019). The applicability of NLP comes in a variety of forms. In our everyday discourse, such as social media conversations, negation signals are employed. In practice, some NLP techniques used in this space are Word2Vec and GloVe (Yu et al., 2017). BERT and XLNet deliver state-of-the-art outcomes as well (Devlin et al., 2018). However, each model has its own set of constraints. Most algorithms underperform when confronted with negation, which is why it is critical to identify novel approaches to overcome this issue in the NLP domain.2.5. Word Negation and Sequence LabelingThe accuracy of NLP models such as sentiment or perception analysis depends on word negation and sequence labeling. Some NLP models typically work by analyzing each word, or sequence of words, independently. These algorithms deconstruct text into its minimum units called tokens (Webster and Kit, 1992). Once these tokens have been cleaned up, the algorithms read each word or tokenized entity independently and
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Computing methodologies Natural language processing1. IntroductionNegation is an inescapable variable when it comes to human communication. To convey spoken words or written texts, negations need not to be neglected because they are integral to everyday expression (Coombs, 2015; Ifeanyi et al., 2014). Popular text mining techniques have been studied over the years as to how they can automatically detect emotions, attitudes, sentiments, and perceptions, to name a few (Jiao and Qu, 2019). Some notable features that have received less attention in text analysis are negations and multiple negatives (Baker, 1969). As a result, the overall accuracy of popular sentiment analyzers has decreased. Understanding negation cues is essential for looping every word in a sentence together and capturing the elements that were affected.The term ”negation” is a linguistic feature that negates the meaning of its closest neighbor in a sentence; i.e., it is the semantic opposite of a phenomenon
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: significance, their extraction has become a somewhat popular topic in Natural Language Processing [Chapman et al., 2001, Huang and Lowe, 2007]. This has naturally led to the creation of resources that annotate this phenomena for supervised learning. One of the best known is BioScope [Vincze et al., 2008], a corpus of biomedical texts in English annotated with both of the previously described phenomena.In Spanish, seven corpora descriptions have been published for negation. Out of those seven, five are from the clinical domain and only two of them factor in uncertainty: i) the IxaMed-GS corpus [Oronoz et al., 2015] is a medical texts corpus annotated at an entity-level, that is, some events are characterised as being negated, speculated, or neither; ii) the UHU-HUVR corpus [Cruz Díaz et al., 2017] and iii) the IULA Spanish Clinical Record Corpus (IULA-SCRC) [Marimon et al., 2017] include negation cues and their scopes; iv) ?) report to be working on extracting negation cue patterns
