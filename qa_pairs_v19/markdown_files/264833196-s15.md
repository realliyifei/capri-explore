Limiting numeric precision in transformer models presents several challenges and considerations that directly affect their performance in arithmetic tasks. The main issues arise from the inability of low-precision models to effectively handle complex mathematical reasoning, leading to significant trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy.

One of the primary challenges is that transformers operating under low numerical precision, such as int8 or float8, often struggle with even basic arithmetic tasks. These models might handle simple operations like basic integer addition but face severe limitations when dealing with more complex tasks. For instance, low-precision transformers fail to solve arithmetic problems unless the model size grows super-polynomially in relation to the input length, a requirement that is deemed impractical for real-world applications [1][4]. This indicates that low precision can severely restrain the expressiveness necessary for effective mathematical reasoning.

Moreover, the choice of numerical precision significantly impacts the overall performance and capability of the model. While low-precision models may offer computational efficiency, they fail in tasks requiring accurate numerical reasoning, which are critical in fields such as scientific computing and advanced mathematical problem-solving [2][4]. For example, under low-precision settings, even elementary arithmetic problems demand a model size that is not feasible, making the use of such models unsuitable for many applications.

In contrast, increasing the numerical precision, for example, by using float32, allows transformers to handle a broader range of arithmetic operations effectively while maintaining a reasonable hidden dimension [2][3]. This adjustment facilitates the model's ability to perform complex arithmetic operations without necessitating an impractically large model size. In empirical experiments conducted across different arithmetic tasks, it was found that transformers utilizing standard numerical precision significantly outperformed their low-precision counterparts, demonstrating the necessity of sufficient precision in enhancing performance [1][3].

Another consideration is how the internal representation within transformers adapts based on precision. High precision can enable transformers to represent real numbers more accurately, enhancing their capability to address complex reasoning tasks within a fixed model size [5]. This adaptability is crucial in ensuring that the models can operate effectively within real-world constraints, where context lengths are typically in the hundreds of thousands of tokens.

In summary, while low-precision transformers may provide some benefits in computational efficiency, the challenges they present‚Äîsuch as the need for impractically large model sizes to solve even simple problems, and failures in accurate numerical reasoning‚Äîshould prompt careful consideration when designing and deploying these models for tasks requiring mathematical prowess. Increasing numeric precision is essential, as it significantly improves the performance of transformers in arithmetic tasks, allowing for efficient handling of complex problems while adhering to practical deployment constraints [2][3][4].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: neurons, enabling the Transformer to perform arithmetic tasks more effectively. These results not only underscore the critical role of numerical precision in enhancing the theoretical capabilities of LLMs for mathematical tasks but also offer practical insights. While low-precision models may provide computational efficiency, ensuring adequate numerical precision is essential for applications involving complex mathematical reasoning. A summary of our results is presented in Table¬†1.In addition to theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments to empirically validate our conclusions. First, we evaluate the performance of Transformers trained from scratch on the aforementioned arithmetic tasks, systematically examining how problem size and numerical precision impact their capabilities. Furthermore, we also conduct experiments on LLAMA 3.1 (Dubey et¬†al., 2024) to evaluate the performance of these arithmetic tasks under different numerical precision. Our empirical results
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: the critical importance of numerical precision when deploying Transformers for arithmetic tasks. Under low-precision settings, a Transformer requires super-polynomial model size to solve even elementary arithmetic problems, which is impractical for real-world applications. While low-precision models may offer computational efficiency, they are likely to fail in scenarios that demand accurate numerical reasoning, such as mathematical problem-solving or scientific computing. However, a slight increase in precision‚Äîsuch as using float32‚Äîenables Transformers to handle more complex arithmetic operations while maintaining a reasonable hidden dimension. Thus, employing sufficient numerical precision is crucial for ensuring both accuracy and robustness in arithmetic tasks, and should be a key consideration when designing or deploying LLMs for applications involving complex arithmetic reasoning.Figure 2: Model performance on different tasks in base-2.

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: precision as a key factor that influences their effectiveness in mathematical tasks. Our results show that Transformers operating with low numerical precision fail to address arithmetic tasks, such as iterated addition and integer multiplication, unless the model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In contrast, Transformers with standard numerical precision can efficiently handle these tasks with significantly smaller model sizes. We further support our theoretical findings through empirical experiments that explore the impact of varying numerical precision on arithmetic tasks, providing valuable insights for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.How Numerical Precision Affects Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities of LLMsGuhao Feng‚Ä†‚Ä†thanks: Equal contribution.1,Kai Yang‚Ä†‚Ä†footnotemark: 1,Yuntian Gu1,Xinyue Ai1,Shengjie Luo1,Jiacheng Sun2,Di He1,Zhenguo Li2,Liwei Wang11Peking University ‚ÄÑ2Huawei Noah‚Äôs Ark Lab1
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: complete the task with a fixed number of layers and a reasonable model size.While low-precision Transformers can effectively handle some simplest arithmetic tasks, such as basic integer addition, their capacity is severely limited when addressing more complex tasks. As demonstrated, low numerical precision, such as int8 and float8, imposes fundamental constraints, preventing these models from solving problems that would require Transformers with super-polynomial size.5 Standard-Precision Transformers Are Sufficient for Arithmetic TasksIn Section¬†4, we demonstrated that low-precision Transformers struggle with arithmetic tasks due to their expressive limitations. In this section, we will show that increasing numerical precision is essential to overcoming this limitation. In particular, we focus on standard-precision Transformers and show that such models can overcome these limitations and solve arithmetic problems efficiently.To formalize the notion of standard precision
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: we focus on standard-precision Transformers and show that such models can overcome these limitations and solve arithmetic problems efficiently.To formalize the notion of standard precision (e.g., float32), we follow Feng et¬†al. (2023) and adopt the setting of a logarithmic-precision Transformer (See formal definition in Appendix¬†B). In this setting, the Transformer‚Äôs internal neurons can represent real numbers with up to O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\log n) bits, where nùëõn denotes the maximum input sequence length. Given that modern LLMs often limit their context length to hundreds of thousands of tokens (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et¬†al., 2023; Anthropic, 2024), it is natural to treat 323232 as the logarithmic scale corresponding to 100,000100000100,000. Hence, the logarithmic-precision setting reflects practical deployment scenarios.We first establish that, under logarithmic precision, a Transformer with constant depth and dimension can solve both the integer addition and iterated addition tasks
