## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Transcription tasks and synthesis tasks in programming represent two distinct categories, with different characteristics in terms of input and output.

Transcription tasks focus on the conversion of spoken language or written language into a structured format. This could involve transforming audio recordings into text or interpreting written documents to create structured data. These tasks are fundamentally about accurately capturing information in its intended format, typically using methods derived from natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as those used in machine translation [1]. The output of a transcription task is usually a verbatim copy of the input data, albeit in a different format. 

In contrast, synthesis tasks are geared toward generating new code based on predefined specifications or contexts. This category can be further divided into program synthesis and code completion. Program synthesis generates an independent code unit from a more abstract description or specification, producing outputs such as functions or classes. Code completion, on the other hand, is less formal and can yield outputs ranging from individual tokens to small snippets of code based on a given context [1]. Thus, synthesis tasks emphasize not just recreation but the creative generation of new outputs based on contextual understanding.

In terms of input characteristics, transcription tasks often work with natural language data or audio recordings, which necessitate a strong grasp of linguistic components such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics [2]. The input for synthesis tasks, however, can be a mix of natural language and programming language concepts or even a combination of both. This allows for a broader scope of data types that can be utilized in the generation of code [1].

The output characteristics also significantly differ between the two tasks. While transcription typically results in structured text that closely mirrors the input, synthesis tasks produce code that is generally a creative transformation of specifications. In program synthesis, outputs are more comprehensive and structured, creating self-contained units of code, whereas code completion outputs are smaller and serve as snippets that might assist in coding tasks [1]. 

Overall, the key distinctions lie in the nature of the task: transcription is about accurately capturing and converting existing information, while synthesis is about generating new information based on defined criteria. This results in differing input types and output standards that define the objectives and methodologies of each task category within programming [1] [2].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: does not explicitly occur in either input or output, we include tasks of such form for two reasons.First, PL has been demonstrated to contain abundant statistical properties similar to NL Mou et al. (2016).Second, most of the ways that PL is processed are derived from NLP, like machine translation techniques Tufano et al. (2019) in the transcription task (§ 2.5).2.4 Synthesis TasksThe synthesis task generates a program given a context (which can be NL, PL, or their mixture), thus can accelerate the development process.It can be further divided into program synthesis and code completion by the formal completeness of the output.The output of program synthesis is a relatively independent unit, such as a function and a class, while the output of code completion is less restricted, ranging from tokens to code snippets.Program synthesisis also called code generation.It is the systematic derivation of a program from a given specification Manna and Waldinger
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: ambiguous [4]. In fact, it is categorized as AI-complete, meaning that its resolution requires the “synthesis of human-level intelligence” with regard to natural language [9].Consequently, a machine must be able to understand each component of language, that is its phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.This is reflected in a set of specific challenges, called NLP tasks, that provide a measure as to a machine’s linguistic capabilities. These tasks can generally be solved by various methods. However, in recent years the research field has been dominated by machine learning approaches, in particular artificial neural networks that enable deep learning [6]. Importantly, such models cannot operate directly on discrete symbolic inputs. Hence, TR becomes a crucial second dimension of NLP.II-A Natural Language Processing TasksAs previously outlined, computational language understanding can be roughly broken down into the lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic
