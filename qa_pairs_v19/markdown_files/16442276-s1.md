## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Introduction sentences are preferred over citing sentences for generating survey articles because they help create a coherent narrative that integrates multiple pieces of research into a unified story, making the content more accessible and engaging for the reader. The context suggests that when generating literature reviews or survey articles, human judges show a strong preference for writing styles that incorporate transition sentences and higher-level abstractions, rather than merely concatenating summaries of individual papers [1][2]. This preference emphasizes the importance of generating content at the paragraph or section level, as it facilitates the establishment of connections between cited papers, thus enhancing readability and comprehension [2].

Furthermore, human evaluators have indicated a dislike for literature reviews that simply string together summaries of cited works, highlighting the need for more sophisticated integration methods that articulate how these works relate to one another [2]. The surveys referenced in the context identify that human preference aligns with the creation of a narrative that captures the interconnections among research contributions, rather than a fragmented presentation of citations [2][5]. In this light, introduction sentences serve to set the stage for the discussion, providing necessary context and a framework for understanding the contributions of the cited papers.

Additionally, the research reveals that human judges are sensitive to the relevance of each cited paper, and poorly designed citations that emphasize less impactful studies can detract from the overall quality of the survey article [2]. This suggests that crafting effective introduction sentences that outline the significance of the papers being discussed can mitigate this issue, as they offer a guiding narrative that reinforces the relevance and importance of the cited works within the broader research domain.

Moreover, the exploration of various features in generating citation text indicates that integrating more abstract reasoning, as encapsulated in introduction sentences, leads to a stronger alignment with human evaluative preferences [1]. The ability to generate a coherent and engaging narrative not only enhances the attractiveness of the lifecycle of the survey article but also provides a clear roadmap for the reader, facilitating easier navigation through the intellectual landscape of the research presented. 

In summary, introduction sentences are favored for generating survey articles because they foster coherence, enhance the narrative flow, provide context for the importance of cited works, and ultimately cater to human evaluative preferences for integrative and high-level abstractions [1][2][5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: multiple papers has been ignored; prior works have focused on generating a single citation sentence in isolation, without addressing the expository and transition sentences needed to connect multiple papers in a coherent story. In this work, we explore a feature-based, LLM-prompting approach to generate richer citation texts, as well as generating multiple citations at once to capture the complex relationships among research papers. We perform an expert evaluation to investigate the impact of our proposed features on the quality of the generated paragraphs and find a strong correlation between human preference and integrative writing style, suggesting that humans prefer high-level, abstract citations, with transition sentences between them to provide an overall story.(a) Bing Chat output (“more precise” setting).(b) Our approach.Figure 1: Comparison between GPT4-powered Bing Chat and our approach on reproducing Section 2 of this paper.

2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: each other and why they are important. Our approach focuses on using the strong natural language understanding and summarization abilities of LLMs to extract interpretable, natural language features describing the content of the cited and target papers, as well as their relationships with each other and with other papers that have cited them in the past. We also propose a “main ideas" plan to guide the LLM to generate a coherent story, using a human-supplied plan in these preliminary experiments.Our detailed expert evaluation reveals that human judges dislike literature reviews that simply concatenate cited paper summaries together, demonstrating the importance of generating at the paragraph or section level, including transition sentences, rather than focusing on individual citations. Human judges are also sensitive to the relevance of each cited paper and strongly dislike generations that wrongly emphasize less impactful papers. We conclude that accurate descriptions of a cited

The full survey questions are included in the appendix (13.1). (Top right) Human evaluations show that perceived utility increases as the relative time taken to evaluate whether sentences are properly supported by citation increases across the extractive-abstractive spectrum. (Bottom) Examples of the five operating points from the reference implementations spanning the extractive-abstractive spectrum. More abstractive generations are more concise and better suit the reading level as requested in the query than more extractive generations, which more closely reflect the original source context, making them easier to verify.In this work, we interrogate whether we can achieve verifiability while retaining the benefits of LLM responses by studying the landscape of verifiable

However, we observe that the Vertex API flags imperatives as sentences that do not require citation, even though responses to MASH queries often contain commands that provide health directives (e.g. "Do not give adult cough medicine to children under age 4."). We hope to see future work on the task of determining which sentences require citation. The results in Figures 5 and 6 show that evaluating the citation precision, coverage, and T2V over all generated
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: were placed in the same paragraph, and Martin-Boyle et al. (2024) found significant differences in the organization of generated RWS with and without human-assisted citation grouping. We suggest fully automatic citation ordering and grouping as an important area for further investigation.Transition sentences and writing style.Based on the terms from general summarization Klavans et al. (2001), Hoang and Kan (2010) distinguished informative sentences, which “give detail on a specific aspect of the problem…definitions, purpose or application of the topic", and indicative sentences, which “make the topic transition explicit and rhetorically sound". However, modern abstractive approaches have focused on informative sentences: single citation generation approaches completely ignore indicative transition sentences, and section-level approaches include them only in that they are part of the target paragraphs. Li and Ouyang (2024) found that human readers asked for more transition
