## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know because the context provided does not include any information regarding the preference for introduction sentences over citing sentences in generating survey articles. The passages focus on summarizing the structure and content of a survey paper in neural machine translation, touching on various aspects such as linguistic challenges, methodologies, evaluation approaches, and the overall aim of the survey. No indication or reasoning is provided about the specific preference for introduction sentences in the context of survey article writing.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: and finally neural machine translation systems which represent the current dominant state of the art. In this survey paper, we condense the field into a single article and first outline some of the linguistic challenges of the task, introduce the most popular datasets that are available to researchers (for both English and other languages), and summarise the various methods and techniques that have been developed with a particular focus on artificial error generation. We next describe the many different approaches to evaluation as well as concerns surrounding metric reliability, especially in relation to subjective human judgements, before concluding with an overview of recent progress and suggestions for future work and remaining challenges. We hope that this survey will serve as comprehensive resource for researchers who are new to the field or who want to be kept apprised of recent developments.††issue: x1 IntroductionWriting is a learnt skill that is particularly challenging
