## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The provided context does not include any information regarding the preferences for introduction sentences over citing sentences in generating survey articles in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The passages primarily focus on the creation of datasets, the classification of research topics, and the methods of summarization within NLP, but they do not address the structural or stylistic preferences for writing survey articles specifically. Therefore, the context is insufficient to answer the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the laws of thermodynamics?” Following a quality inspection of the synthetically produced questions, we assembled a training dataset of 1601 examples, consisting of 120 questions for each of the 12 topics and 161 general questions. We also derived a test dataset containing 364 examples with a balanced class distribution similar to the training dataset.In our experiments, we evaluated three classification approaches: vector similarity search, prompting a LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), and few-shot fine-tuning of a transformer model with the SetFit framework Tunstall et al. (2022). Concerning the vector search approach with the SPECTER2 model, we measured the cosine similarity to compare vectors of embedded user queries with paper embeddings in our vector database to retrieve the 100 most similar

As a last construction step, we further enriched the KG with metadata from the Semantic Scholar API, including one-sentence too long; didn’t read (TLDR) summaries, citation counts, and publication references.4 Results and Discussion4.1 Model Training and EvaluationResearch Topic Classification.In the following sections, we report the results of training and evaluating the NLP models that underpin the three-phase search process of our developed dialogue system: (1) research topic classification, (2) article text clustering, and (3) comparative article summarization.The first phase involves classifying an uttered search goal or problem description into a fitting NLP research topic. This is especially helpful for users in exploratory search settings because they may not be familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: instead of producing output text for each sentence, it condenses the input to a concise form representing the vital information present in the text. The two main branches of text summarization are - extractive-summarization and abstractive-summarization. The earlier methods focused upon extractive-summarization, in which the entire sentences are extracted based upon their significance [23, 30]. Recent methods focus on the more critical approach of summarizing text by paraphrasing the information learned without using sentences from the original text. Such methods generally deploy deep learning-based sequence-to-sequence models [24, 31].3.2 Evolution of NLPOver the years, NLP has made considerable strides as a result of ground-breaking research, rising processing capacity, and the creation of complex language models. The development of NLP is evidence of the persistent effort to close the language and artificial intelligence gap. The major advancements from rule-based systems,

[5]:  Passage ID 5: disabilities and improve many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as text summarization (Lin, 2003; Zajic et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013), headline (Rush et al., 2015; Filippova et al., 2015) and subtitle generation (Luotolahti and Ginter, 2015), machine translation (Li et al., 2020a) and speech processing (Wu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012).Transforming a long sentence into a more concise form without losing any important information is not always a straightforward task. There are two ways for addressing this problem: a) shortening the long sentence, without losing key information from it, and b) splitting it into two or more short sentences. The first task, which is met in the literature as sentence compression or sentence summarization receives a long sentence as input and generates a shortened version retaining the most important information. Sentence compression can be extractive or abstractive. Extractive methods work by simply deleting words from the input
