## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Pre-trained language models (PLMs), particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced the efficiency of watermarking techniques through advanced capabilities in understanding language semantics and context. This enhancement is primarily attributed to the sophisticated embedding methods and the intricate semantic grasp these models possess. 

LLMs facilitate sophisticated watermarking approaches that allow for the embedding of watermarks with minimal impact on the text's inherent meaning. This results in watermarking techniques that are more effective and subtle, preserving the original intent of the text while embedding essential watermark features. Thus, the integration of LLMs into watermarking processes leads to better performance and reliability [2]. 

Moreover, the traditional model of embedding watermarks has evolved. For example, text generated by LLMs can be efficiently watermarked using existing text watermarking algorithms, or LLMs can be utilized directly to embed watermarks in the generated texts. This dual approach leverages the unique capabilities of LLMs to produce high-quality, contextually relevant content while simultaneously ensuring that the watermark remains undetectable [2]. 

In practical terms, watermark algorithms can be incorporated at various stages, including the pre-processing, generation, and post-processing stages of text production. This flexibility allows for diverse watermark embedding techniques that can be tailored to specific requirements and challenges, such as different applications in the medical domain where the stakes of maintaining text integrity and privacy are particularly high [4]. The rapid development of LLMs and their ability to handle complex tasks further underscores their role in revolutionizing watermarking applications [3]. 

Additionally, advancements in watermarking techniques within LLMs have resulted in a reduced embedding time. For instance, a method was mentioned that reduced the embedding time from 10 hours to just 10 seconds, showcasing the significant efficiency improvements that PLMs bring to the watermarking processes [1]. 

Overall, the deployment of specialized medical pre-trained language models (Med-PLMs) alongside conventional watermarking techniques addresses specific challenges in the medical domain, where datasets are often sensitive and require careful handling to protect patient privacy. The combination of LLM capabilities and watermarking strategies not only enhances both efficiency and effectiveness but also creates a more robust framework for securing text generated or analyzed in these high-stakes environments [1] [5].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: watermarks across various medical downstream tasks. Additionally, our method demonstrates robustness against various attacks and significantly enhances the efficiency of watermark embedding, reducing the embedding time from 10 hours to 10 seconds.IntroductionIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), pre-trained language models followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks have become the standard approach (Devlin et al. 2019; Brown et al. 2020; Touvron et al. 2023). This approach is especially crucial in the medical domain, where most downstream datasets contain patient privacy information and are not publicly available (Wang et al. 2023).However, traditional pre-trained models often underperform in the medical domain due to their general-purpose nature, prompting the development of specialized Med-PLMs (Lee et al. 2020; Gu et al. 2021; Wu et al. 2024), which are pre-trained on medical domain texts. Model owners often deploy their Med-PLMs in the Machine Learning as a

Due to their advanced grasp of language semantics and context, LLMs facilitate sophisticated watermarking approaches that embed watermarks with minimal impact on the text’s inherent meaning (Abdelnabi and Fritz, 2021; Zhang et al., 2023a). This integration results in more effective and subtle watermarking techniques, preserving the text’s original intent while embedding essential watermark features.1.3. Why a Survey for Text Watermarking in the Era of LLMs?Text watermarking technology and large language models can effectively enhance each other. For instance, text generated by LLMs can be watermarked using text watermarking algorithms (Brassil et al., 1995; Por et al., 2012; Rizzo et al., 2016; Munyer and Zhong, 2023; Yang et al., 2022, 2023; Yoo et al., 2023b), or LLMs themselves can be utilized to embed watermarks in texts (Abdelnabi and Fritz, 2021; Zhang et al., 2023a). Additionally, watermark algorithms can be directly incorporated during the text

IntroductionLarge Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing in capability, demonstrating remarkable proficiency across a wide range of applications.From generating coherent and contextually appropriate text to assisting in complex tasks such as code generation [6, 21, 44, 74, 75], medical diagnosis [26, 65, 14], and content creation [17, 39, 54], LLMs are revolutionizing various
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: domain watermarking for LLMs:4.1.1 Embedding Watermarks into TextText-based watermarking techniques [100, 116, 233, 257] utilize the unique linguistic features of each language model to embed watermarks. These features can include word frequency, character modifications, word substitution, or sentence reordering. For example, by using specific vocabulary or phrases, or using specific syntactic structures in the generated text, watermarks can be embedded. Such watermarks may be inconspicuous and difficult to remove or modify. These techniques can be categorized by when the watermark is inserted: watermark embedding in the text pre-processing stage, generation stage, and post-processing stage. In traditional neural network-based text digital watermarking, watermarks can also be embedded in different stages. First, in the text preprocessing stage, watermarks can be embedded in the training data by modifying specific text attributes. Second, in the generation stage, watermarks can be

First, current methods mainly focus on downstream tasks like text classification by using large corpus datasets to further train PLMs and embedding watermarks by poisoning the [CLS] representation of text containing trigger words. However, Med-PLMs are often used in medical natural language understanding (Med-NLU) tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE), and question answering (QA), as well as medical natural language generation (Med-NLG) tasks such as dialogue systems. These tasks do not rely solely on the [CLS]
