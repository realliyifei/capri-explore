## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Pre-trained language models (PLMs), especially those specialized for the medical domain, have significantly improved the efficiency of watermarking techniques in several ways. One of the prominent advancements is their enhanced grasp of language semantics and context, allowing for the embedding of watermarks with minimal impact on the text's inherent meaning. This sophisticated approach results from the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate coherent text while embedding essential watermark features simultaneously [2].

Moreover, watermark embedding processes have become notably faster due to these advanced models. The context indicates that the efficiency of watermark embedding has been dramatically improved, reducing the embedding time from 10 hours to just 10 seconds [1]. This efficiency gain is crucial for practical applications, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where maintaining privacy and the integrity of the data is fundamental.

Further, the ability of LLMs to embed watermarks during various stages of text processing—pre-processing, generation, and post-processing—allows for flexibility and optimization in how watermarks are implemented. For instance, watermarking algorithms can be utilized during the text generation stage, ensuring that the generated output retains its original intent while incorporating watermark features [2][5]. The integration of these techniques supports the creation of watermarks that are inconspicuous and robust against various forms of attacks.

Additionally, pre-trained models demonstrate a correlation between their linguistic knowledge and their effectiveness in embedding watermarks, as they can adapt linguistic features (like word frequency and syntactic structures) to avoid detection while securing ownership of the text [3][5]. This adaptability underpins the growing collaboration between watermarking techniques and PLMs, making these models indispensable in ensuring data security within the context of generative tasks.

In summary, the enhancements in watermarking techniques, stemming from advanced pre-trained language models, lie not only in their semantic capabilities but also in their efficiency and flexibility in embedding processes. They enable quick, subtle, and effective watermarking solutions that cater to the specific challenges posed by various applications, particularly in sensitive domains such as medicine [1][2][3].

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: watermarks across various medical downstream tasks. Additionally, our method demonstrates robustness against various attacks and significantly enhances the efficiency of watermark embedding, reducing the embedding time from 10 hours to 10 seconds.IntroductionIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), pre-trained language models followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks have become the standard approach (Devlin et al. 2019; Brown et al. 2020; Touvron et al. 2023). This approach is especially crucial in the medical domain, where most downstream datasets contain patient privacy information and are not publicly available (Wang et al. 2023).However, traditional pre-trained models often underperform in the medical domain due to their general-purpose nature, prompting the development of specialized Med-PLMs (Lee et al. 2020; Gu et al. 2021; Wu et al. 2024), which are pre-trained on medical domain texts. Model owners often deploy their Med-PLMs in the Machine Learning as a
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: alter this landscape. Due to their advanced grasp of language semantics and context, LLMs facilitate sophisticated watermarking approaches that embed watermarks with minimal impact on the text’s inherent meaning (Abdelnabi and Fritz, 2021; Zhang et al., 2023a). This integration results in more effective and subtle watermarking techniques, preserving the text’s original intent while embedding essential watermark features.1.3. Why a Survey for Text Watermarking in the Era of LLMs?Text watermarking technology and large language models can effectively enhance each other. For instance, text generated by LLMs can be watermarked using text watermarking algorithms (Brassil et al., 1995; Por et al., 2012; Rizzo et al., 2016; Munyer and Zhong, 2023; Yang et al., 2022, 2023; Yoo et al., 2023b), or LLMs themselves can be utilized to embed watermarks in texts (Abdelnabi and Fritz, 2021; Zhang et al., 2023a). Additionally, watermark algorithms can be directly incorporated during the text
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: (Belinkov and Glass, 2019) has been the focus of many studies in the recent NLP research. It has been extensively shown that pre-trained Neural Language Models (NLMs) are able to capture syntax- and semantic-sensitive phenomena (Hewitt and Manning, 2019; Pimentel et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022) and that there is a correlation between the degree of linguistic knowledge and its ability to solve correctly a downstream task (Miaschi et al., 2020; Sarti et al., 2021), although it is still highly debated (Ravichander et al., 2021). However, it has also been demonstrated that introducing additional linguistic information (Wang et al., 2019b; Zhou et al., 2020; Glavaš and Vulić, 2021) during the pre-training phase can enhance models’ performances. In addition, several works showed that transfer learning methods, such as fine-tuning on intermediate supporting tasks, are highly beneficial to improve pre-trained models’ performance in the resolution of multiple final target tasks (Phang et al.,

[4]:  Passage ID 4: KGW and Exponential watermarks offer high text quality and watermark retention but remain vulnerable to most attacks;(2) Post-text attacks are found to be more efficient and practical than pre-text attacks;(3) Pre-text watermarks are generally more imperceptible, as they do not alter text fluency, unlike post-text watermarks;(4) Additionally, combined attack methods can significantly increase effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust watermarking solutions.Our study underscores the vulnerabilities of current techniques and the necessity for developing more resilient schemes. IntroductionLarge Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing in capability, demonstrating remarkable proficiency across a wide range of applications.From generating coherent and contextually appropriate text to assisting in complex tasks such as code generation [6, 21, 44, 74, 75], medical diagnosis [26, 65, 14], and content creation [17, 39, 54], LLMs are revolutionizing various
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: domain watermarking for LLMs:4.1.1 Embedding Watermarks into TextText-based watermarking techniques [100, 116, 233, 257] utilize the unique linguistic features of each language model to embed watermarks. These features can include word frequency, character modifications, word substitution, or sentence reordering. For example, by using specific vocabulary or phrases, or using specific syntactic structures in the generated text, watermarks can be embedded. Such watermarks may be inconspicuous and difficult to remove or modify. These techniques can be categorized by when the watermark is inserted: watermark embedding in the text pre-processing stage, generation stage, and post-processing stage. In traditional neural network-based text digital watermarking, watermarks can also be embedded in different stages. First, in the text preprocessing stage, watermarks can be embedded in the training data by modifying specific text attributes. Second, in the generation stage, watermarks can be
