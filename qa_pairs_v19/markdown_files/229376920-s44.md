## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Linguistic rules can significantly enhance the assessment of Text Style Transfer (TST) models by providing structured frameworks for evaluating various aspects of language styles, thereby improving both the accuracy and relevance of the evaluations.

1. **Content Preservation Metrics**: Linguistic rules can help clarify how to measure content preservation in TST. The integration of specific linguistic features into evaluation metrics allows for a more nuanced assessment of whether the semantic meaning of the original text is maintained post-transfer. The passage notes that existing automated evaluation metrics often fall short in this area because they do not adequately capture the entangled relationship between semantic and stylistic properties [2]. By applying linguistic rules, evaluators can develop more sophisticated metrics that systematically assess the retention of meaning alongside style adjustments.

2. **Fine-Grained Evaluation**: Introducing linguistic rules leads to a detailed evaluation of style transfers. For instance, special evaluation metrics can be designed to assess the transfer strength using a fine-grained ensemble of classifiers, which can focus on specific linguistic elements such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics [3]. Incorporating linguistic constructs into automatic evaluations may enhance the ability to distinguish between different styles, such as formal versus informal, beyond simple binary classifications.

3. **Human Evaluation Synergy**: High-quality linguistic rules can be operationalized by human evaluators, providing a gold standard for performance evaluation [3]. Human evaluators can utilize these rules to assess style-transferred sentences based on predefined criteria, aligning their assessments more closely with linguistic theory. This can lead to a better understanding of how well the TST models align with human cognitive processing of language styles.

4. **Challenge in Transfer vs. Preservation**: Linguistic rules can also address the inherent challenge of optimizing for both style transfer and content preservation. As noted in the context, there is an inverse relationship between transfer strength and content preservation [4]. By applying linguistic insights, researchers may identify criteria that can balance the trade-offs more effectively. Specific rules can help delineate what constitutes an acceptable degree of deviation from the original meaning while still achieving the desired style.

5. **Evaluation of Transfer Quality**: The exploration of novel automatic evaluation metrics through linguistic rules can lead to more reliable assessments of TST models [4]. By establishing clear guidelines based on linguistic theories, such as semiotic and pragmatic principles, evaluations can become more standardized, allowing for consistent comparisons across different TST models.

In conclusion, the integration of linguistic rules into the evaluation framework of TST models can lead to deeper insights and improved methodologies for assessing style transformations. This approach aligns with the inherent complexity of language and enhances the robustness of evaluations, providing clearer guidelines for optimizing TST outcomes. By recognizing the relationship between linguistic structures and style transfer performance, researchers can drive the development of more sophisticated models in this emerging field.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: have demonstrated outstanding performance in traditional NLP tasks, thanks to their ability to leverage massive amounts of data.However, LLMs still have significant shortcomings in imitating human cognition.Text Style Transfer (TST) is a task that can reflect this ability of LLMs to some extent.The style of language is intricately related to human cognition, reflecting various aspects of the speaker’s characteristics, habits, logical thinking, and the specific communicative context, which exhibits a higher level of abstraction (Jin et al., 2022).In linguistics, language style is closely intertwined with human subjective cognition, encompassing the habits and logical thinking of the speaker, the content being described, and specific contextual factors. As a result, “style” transcends mere text and approaches the realm of cognition, reflecting its attributes.The objective of the TST task is to transform text-based language into another style of language with a more abstract
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: scores increase, content preservation scores decrease, and vice versa. A potential reason for observation might be the entanglement between semantic and stylistic properties in natural language; it is hard to separate the two properties, and changing one affects the other. Therefore, when optimizing to transfer the style in text, it is hard to maintain the sentence’s semantic, i.e., the content information.6.6 Human EvaluationWe conducted a human-based evaluation study to further evaluate the TST models’ performance. We focus our human evaluation on representative models from the three TST strategies, and the models are evaluated on sentiment transfer and formality transfer tasks.We first randomly sampled 50 negative and 50 positive sentences from the Yelp dataset for the sentiment transfer task. Next, we perform TST for the sampled sentences using PTO, DRLST and DualRL, which are the best performing models from the various TST strategies when evaluated using G-Score.
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: PPL tends to favor shorter texts, and a single classifier may not accurately differentiate between formal text and speech-style. To address these limitations, we introduce special evaluation metrics for our TSST task. Specifically, we compare the summaries from the original text and the target text to evaluate content preservation, and we propose a fine-grained ensemble of classifiers as a metric to evaluate the transfer strength of our speech-style text.Human Evaluation of TSTIn addition to automated evaluation metrics, human-based evaluation serves as a gold standard for assessing the performance of TST models. Evaluators are asked to assess the style-transferred sentences based on the three criteria discussed in the earlier paragraphs (Xu et al., 2012; Niu et al., 2017). Recently, in a study by Lai et al. (2023), the potential of ChatGPT as a multidimensional evaluator for formal-informal style transfer was explored. It demonstrates that ChatGPT achieves competitive
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Style TransferOur experimental evaluation in Section 6 has illustrated the challenges of evaluating the effectiveness of TST models. The existing evaluation methods have some limitations. First, the evaluation of text style transfer based on transfer accuracy is limited by the performance of the style classifier. Second, similar to previous studies [27, 94], we note that the transfer strength is inversely proportional to content preservation, suggesting that these metrics may be complementary and challenging to optimize simultaneously. The limitations of existing evaluation metrics motivate the exploration of novel automatic evaluation metrics to evaluate TST models.10 Discussion and ConclusionAlthough TST is a relatively new branch of the field of natural language processing, considerable research on TST has recently been conducted. The explosive growth of TST research has generated many novel and interesting TST models. This survey aims to organize these novel TST models
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: on TST have adopted automated evaluation metrics commonly used in various natural language generation tasks to quantitatively assess content preservation during the style transfer process. These metrics include BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE score (Lin and Och, 2004), BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) and others. Furthermore, the strength of the model-based style transfer is a commonly used measure to assess the ability of a TST model. Typically, a binary style classifier is first separately pretrained to predict the style label of input sentences. This classifier is then used to estimate the style transfer accuracy of the transformed style sentences. However, there are several shortcomings with the above metrics when evaluating passage-level and speech-style text. For example, the PPL tends to favor shorter texts, and a single classifier may not accurately differentiate between formal text and speech-style. To address these limitations, we introduce special evaluation metrics
