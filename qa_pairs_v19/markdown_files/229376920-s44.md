## Answer

## I don't know?: False

The assessment of Text Style Transfer (TST) models can be significantly enhanced by incorporating linguistic rules that inform the evaluation process in several key ways.

Firstly, linguistic rules can help in evaluating content preservation, which is crucial in TST tasks where the goal is to alter the style without losing the original content's meaning. As stated, "PPL tends to favor shorter texts... to evaluate content preservation" [5]. By applying linguistic rules, evaluators can more systematically assess how well the semantic content is maintained across stylistic transformations. This systematic approach can ensure a rigorous evaluation of whether the essence of the original text is preserved while transitioning to a different style.

Secondly, linguistic rules enable a more nuanced evaluation of stylistic changes. The entanglement between semantic and stylistic properties complicates the assessment of TST outputs, as altering one aspect often inadvertently influences the other [3] [4]. By applying linguistic principles, evaluators can establish clearer criteria for different stylistic dimensions—such as formality and sentiment—thereby enabling a more objective analysis of the effectiveness of the TST models. For instance, specific linguistic markers can be identified that signify varying levels of formality or sentiment, making it easier to judge whether the TST transformation aligns with the intended style changes.

Additionally, the application of well-defined linguistic rules can complement human evaluations by providing a foundation for automated metrics. Evaluators can utilize these rules to construct fine-grained metrics that quantitatively assess aspects such as emotional tone or formality levels in the transformed text, enhancing the evaluation's robustness [5]. This dual approach—involving both linguistic rule-based frameworks and automated scoring—can provide a comprehensive picture of a model's performance.

Finally, linguistic rules can assist in developing more sophisticated classifiers for the evaluation of TST outputs. By refining how classifiers differentiate between various style types—like formal and informal—the evaluation process becomes more precise. This is especially relevant given the noted difficulties in distinguishing these styles using a single classifier [5]. By incorporating linguistic insights into classifier development, evaluators can improve the ability to categorize transformed texts according to defined stylistic characteristics, ensuring that evaluations truly reflect the quality of the style transfer.

In conclusion, linguistic rules play a vital role in enhancing TST model assessment by promoting content preservation, enabling a nuanced evaluation of stylistic dimensions, supporting the development of more refined evaluation metrics, and improving classifier accuracy. These improvements collectively ensure a more comprehensive, rigorous, and objective evaluation of TST models, leading to better understanding and advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing.

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: scores increase, content preservation scores decrease, and vice versa. A potential reason for observation might be the entanglement between semantic and stylistic properties in natural language; it is hard to separate the two properties, and changing one affects the other. Therefore, when optimizing to transfer the style in text, it is hard to maintain the sentence’s semantic, i.e., the content information.6.6 Human EvaluationWe conducted a human-based evaluation study to further evaluate the TST models’ performance. We focus our human evaluation on representative models from the three TST strategies, and the models are evaluated on sentiment transfer and formality transfer tasks.We first randomly sampled 50 negative and 50 positive sentences from the Yelp dataset for the sentiment transfer task. Next, we perform TST for the sampled sentences using PTO, DRLST and DualRL, which are the best performing models from the various TST strategies when evaluated using G-Score.

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: PPL tends to favor shorter texts, and a single classifier may not accurately differentiate between formal text and speech-style. To address these limitations, we introduce special evaluation metrics for our TSST task. Specifically, we compare the summaries from the original text and the target text to evaluate content preservation, and we propose a fine-grained ensemble of classifiers as a metric to evaluate the transfer strength of our speech-style text.Human Evaluation of TSTIn addition to automated evaluation metrics, human-based evaluation serves as a gold standard for assessing the performance of TST models. Evaluators are asked to assess the style-transferred sentences based on the three criteria discussed in the earlier paragraphs (Xu et al., 2012; Niu et al., 2017). Recently, in a study by Lai et al. (2023), the potential of ChatGPT as a multidimensional evaluator for formal-informal style transfer was explored. It demonstrates that ChatGPT achieves competitive
