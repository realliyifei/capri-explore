## Answer (I don't know?: ‚úì)

I don't know. The provided context does not contain specific information about how statistical association measures determine the strength of word associations in the discovery of multiword expressions (MWEs). While it discusses issues related to MWEs and mentions various methods and models for their identification, it does not detail the role or application of statistical association measures in this process. Therefore, the context is insufficient to address your question completely and precisely.

Trend is given for the average over: all pairs, strong MWE relations, and weak MWE relations.Classical treatments of semantics are compositional, implying that the meaning of a sentence is derived by composing the meanings of each individual word. However, there are groups of words whose meaning can only be derived when looking at the entire group rather than the individual words. These word groups, known as multiword expressions (MWEs), include idioms like break a leg, where the isolated meaning of each of the component words break, a, and leg fail to compose the meaning of the entire expression. Higher interaction values for the tokens in the idiom would indicate a less compositional

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: (MT) [17, 16], which depends on a clear distinction between word tokens and phrases, has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs [8, 29]. The usual approach in these applications is to identify MWEs first, and then treat them accordingly. Therefore, detecting MWEs is a key research area in NLP.In recent years, the identification of MWEs has been modelled as a supervised machine learning task where the machine learning models are trained on an annotated dataset. As we explain in Section 2, several datasets have been released to train these machine learning models. Furthermore shared tasks such as SemEval-2016 Task 10 [28] and PARSEME [27] have contributed to develop datasets. In recent years, neural network-based models, and in particular architectures incorporating RecurrentNeural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in MWE identification tasks [27]. Usually, these models utilise
