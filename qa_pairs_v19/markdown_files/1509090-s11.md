## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information or detailed explanations regarding the use of statistical association measures to determine the strength of word associations in the discovery of multiword expressions (MWEs). While the context discusses various methodologies and approaches in MWE identification, such as supervised machine learning tasks, neural network models, and the need for annotated datasets, it lacks direct references to statistical association measures and how they contribute specifically to discovering MWEs. Therefore, it is insufficient to form a complete and precise answer to your question.

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: (MT) [17, 16], which depends on a clear distinction between word tokens and phrases, has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs [8, 29]. The usual approach in these applications is to identify MWEs first, and then treat them accordingly. Therefore, detecting MWEs is a key research area in NLP.In recent years, the identification of MWEs has been modelled as a supervised machine learning task where the machine learning models are trained on an annotated dataset. As we explain in Section 2, several datasets have been released to train these machine learning models. Furthermore shared tasks such as SemEval-2016 Task 10 [28] and PARSEME [27] have contributed to develop datasets. In recent years, neural network-based models, and in particular architectures incorporating RecurrentNeural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in MWE identification tasks [27]. Usually, these models utilise
