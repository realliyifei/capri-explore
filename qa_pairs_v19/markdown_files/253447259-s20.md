## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The context provided does not specifically discuss the advantages and limitations of the edit generation approach in Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). While the passages mention GEC as a significant area within natural language processing, the detail about "edit generation" specifically is absent, and the available information primarily focuses on general GEC methods such as machine translation approaches and the progress made in the field without elaborating on specific techniques or their advantages and limitations. Thus, the context is insufficient to provide a precise answer to the question.

[1]: Passage ID 1: number of non-native learners and writers of the English language around the globe, the necessity to improve authoring tools such as error correction systems is increasing. Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a well-established natural language processing (NLP) task that deals with building systems for automatically correcting errors in written text, particularly in non-native written text. The errors that a GEC system attempts to correct are not limited to grammatical errors, but also include spelling and collocation errors.GEC in English has gained much attention within the NLP community recently. The phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approach has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for this task (?; ?), in which GEC is treated as a translation task from the language of “bad” English to the language of “good” English. The translation model is learned using parallel error-corrected corpora (source text that contains errors and their corresponding corrected

[4]: Passage ID 4: Jie Liu, Zhuo Liu View a PDF of the paper titled A Comprehensive Survey of Grammar Error Correction, by Yu Wang and 3 other authorsView PDFAbstract:Grammar error correction (GEC) is an important application aspect of natural language processing techniques. The past decade has witnessed significant progress achieved in GEC for the sake of increasing popularity of machine learning and deep learning, especially in late 2010s when near human-level GEC systems are available. However, there is no prior work focusing on the whole recapitulation of the progress. We present the first survey in GEC for a comprehensive retrospect of the literature in this area. We first give the introduction of five public datasets, data annotation schema, two important shared tasks and four standard evaluation metrics. More importantly, we discuss four kinds of basic approaches, including statistical machine translation based approach, neural machine translation based approach, classification based approach
