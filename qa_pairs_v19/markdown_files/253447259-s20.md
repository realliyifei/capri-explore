## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided contains detailed information about grammatical error correction (GEC) and its recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), including the approaches used such as statistical machine translation and neural machine translation. However, it does not specifically address the advantages and limitations of the edit generation approach in GEC. 

The passages discuss the types of errors that GEC systems aim to correct, such as grammatical errors, misspellings, and semantic issues, as well as the development of different methods in GEC over time [1][2][3][4][5]. Yet, there is no mention of the edit generation approach or its specific advantages or limitations within the context, leaving this question unanswered.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: number of non-native learners and writers of the English language around the globe, the necessity to improve authoring tools such as error correction systems is increasing. Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a well-established natural language processing (NLP) task that deals with building systems for automatically correcting errors in written text, particularly in non-native written text. The errors that a GEC system attempts to correct are not limited to grammatical errors, but also include spelling and collocation errors.GEC in English has gained much attention within the NLP community recently. The phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approach has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for this task (?; ?), in which GEC is treated as a translation task from the language of “bad” English to the language of “good” English. The translation model is learned using parallel error-corrected corpora (source text that contains errors and their corresponding corrected
