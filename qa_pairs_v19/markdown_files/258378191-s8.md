## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information about recent supervised models for keyphrase extraction or detail the techniques they employ. The passages discuss keyphrase extraction and generation broadly, mentioning pre-trained language models (PLMs) and categorizing tasks but do not explicitly cover recent supervised models or their methodologies. The absence of detailed technical descriptions or algorithms relating to supervised approaches hinders a precise response.

[1]:  Passage ID 1: a comprehensive exploration jointly both keyphrase extraction and generation using pre-trained language models spotlights a critical gap in the literature, compelling our survey paper to bridge this deficiency and offer a unified and in-depth analysis to address limitations in previous surveys. This paper extensively examines the topic of pre-trained language models for keyphrase prediction (PLM-KP), which are trained on large text corpora via different learning (supervisor, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised) techniques, to provide respective insights into these two types of tasks in NLP, precisely, Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) and Keyphrase Generation (KPG). We introduce appropriate taxonomies for PLM-KPE and KPG to highlight these two main tasks of NLP. Moreover, we point out some promising future directions for predicting keyphrases.keywords: Keyphrases , Keyphrase extraction , Keyphrase generation , pre-trained language models , Natural language processing ,

[5]:  Passage ID 5: out some promising future directions for predicting keyphrases.keywords: Keyphrases , Keyphrase extraction , Keyphrase generation , pre-trained language models , Natural language processing , Large language models , review††journal: ICT Express1 IntroductionTo determine if a keyphrase is present in a document, it must appear as a single contiguous word. Keyphrase extraction involves using a model to accurately identify and classify the keyphrases in the document. The generation of keyphrases is another task in which the model predicts both present and absent keyphrases within the context of the document, introduced in [1]. The application of deep learning technologies has witnessed a noticeable rise in using pre-trained language models (PLMs) in NLP in recent years. PLMs are trained using different strategies on extensive text corpora and have shown exceptional performance in various downstream tasks, including Keyphrase Predation.
