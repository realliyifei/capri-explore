## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Recent supervised models approach keyphrase extraction (KPE) by leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) that are fine-tuned on specific datasets to enhance their performance in identifying and classifying keyphrases within documents. These models operate on the fundamental premise that keyphrases must appear as contiguous phrases and utilize various deep learning techniques to achieve this goal [1][3].

The supervised models are generally trained on large annotated datasets that facilitate their learning process, allowing them to accurately predict the presence of keyphrases based on context. Supervised learning involves training the models with labeled data, where keyphrases are explicitly marked, reducing the ambiguity present in unsupervised methods. The advancements in deep learning and PLMs have significantly improved KPE's accuracy and reliability [1][2].

In the context of the methodology, recent approaches typically include the utilization of various vector representations of words, often achieved through embedding techniques. This allows the models to capture semantic relationships between words, which is crucial in identifying keyphrases that may not be directly evident from surface-level texts [3]. For instance, techniques such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have transformed the approach to KPE by enabling models to understand contextual nuances better, thereby improving the extraction accuracy [2][3].

Moreover, supervised models often employ a mix of various learning techniques, such as self-supervised and semi-supervised methods, to enhance learning efficiency when labeled data may be limited [1][3]. These methods can help in transferring knowledge from larger datasets to improve the accuracy of models on smaller, task-specific datasets, thus mitigating common challenges experienced in KPE tasks.

The comparative analysis of various models in recent research has highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of supervised approaches against other methods. For instance, it was found that unsupervised extraction models often perform worse than their supervised counterparts; however, specific scenarios, like significant domain discrepancies between training and testing sets, can lead to better performance of unsupervised models in certain cases [4]. This observation underscores the importance of carefully selecting training data and tuning the models according to the specific requirements of the KPE task.

In conclusion, recent supervised models for keyphrase extraction employ advanced techniques reliant on pre-trained language models, training on labeled data with deep learning methods, and utilizing sophisticated embedding strategies to capture keyphrase context accurately. This integrated approach allows them to significantly enhance the precision of keyphrase extraction compared to traditional methods [1][3] [4].
