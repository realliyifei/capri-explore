## Answer

## I don't know?: False

The context provided offers an overview of keyphrase extraction and generation using pre-trained language models (PLMs) but does not specifically detail recent supervised models or the techniques they employ for keyphrase extraction. Here’s an answer articulated using the information available:

Recent advancements in keyphrase extraction have been largely influenced by the capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs). These models leverage various learning strategies, including supervised learning, which has shown efficacy in addressing tasks such as Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) and Keyphrase Generation (KPG) [1] [2].

In supervised learning setups for KPE, models are trained on annotated datasets where keyphrases are explicitly labeled within the text. This technique allows the models to learn directly from examples, thereby improving their ability to predict keyphrases when applied to new, unseen documents. Supervised models typically require a significant amount of labeled training data, as the algorithms learn to identify linguistic patterns and context that correlate with the presence of keyphrases [1][3].

PLMs are pre-trained on large text corpora using varying techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised learning methods. Following this pre-training, these models can be fine-tuned on specific keyphrase extraction tasks using supervised techniques [1][5]. This fine-tuning adjusts the model parameters to enhance performance in identifying keyphrases relevant to the specific domains or contexts of interest.

Furthermore, recent studies highlight how deep learning advancements have augmented the capabilities of supervised models in NLP, allowing them to extract keyphrases with higher accuracy. These models employ neural network architectures, often utilizing attention mechanisms, which allow them to weigh the importance of different parts of the input text when generating predictions about keyphrases [4].

In summary, although the exact methodologies of recent supervised models in keyphrase extraction are not explicitly described in the provided context, it is evident that PLMs play a central role, and techniques such as fine-tuning on labeled datasets and leveraging neural networks are fundamental to their approach. However, specific details regarding the latest model architectures or empirical results are not included within the context provided, highlighting a need for more direct information on the subject.
