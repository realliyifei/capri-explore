## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

To enhance data quality and diversity in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), researchers employ a variety of data augmentation techniques aimed at addressing data scarcity and improving model generalization in unseen environments. These strategies include generating synthetic instructions, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, and creating novel training environments.

1. **Synthetic Instruction Generation**: One prominent technique is the use of speaker models to synthesize new navigation instructions. This method involves training these models to generate instructions from specific navigation paths, significantly enriching the dataset used for training the agents [1][5]. The Speaker-follower models facilitate this process by implementing pragmatic reasoning, effectively augmenting the existing instruction datasets with new, plausible navigation commands [2].

2. **Environmental Augmentation**: Another critical aspect of improving data diversity lies in environmental augmentation techniques. These techniques involve creating new, varied environments to train agents, thus simulating numerous navigation scenarios. Methods such as "EnvDrop," which proposes environmental dropout strategies, help to generate diverse training environments by randomly masking visual features and altering context-related elements within familiar settings [2][4]. Additionally, approaches like segmenting and recombining scenes can enhance the diversity of training data while maintaining relevance to real-world navigation conditions [5].

3. **Counterfactual Reasoning**: To further refine data quality, researchers explore counterfactual reasoning approaches. This methodology involves simulating various scenarios where the outcomes of navigation actions could differ based on different preceding paths or environmental conditions. By leveraging adversarial training in this context, the system can learn from contrasting situations, thereby improving its robustness to various command interpretations and resultant actions [3][4].

4. **Auxiliary Task Integration**: Incorporating auxiliary tasks into the training process has also proven to be beneficial. By introducing tasks that require reasoning or decision-making based on rich semantic information, models can learn more generalized navigation strategies that apply across multiple contexts. This approach enhances the learning process by providing more comprehensive training data, even when direct navigation instructions are limited [2][3].

5. **Alteration of Instruction Styles**: Studies have also examined the effects of different instruction styles on agent training. Training agents on diverse instruction styles allows models to generalize better, enabling them to handle a variety of user inputs and caregiving to different communication dynamics [1][5].

In summary, the strategies to improve data quality and diversity in VLN largely focus on generating synthetic instructions, modifying environmental contexts, applying counterfactual reasoning, integrating auxiliary tasks, and varying instruction styles. These methodologies collectively aim to create a richer and more diverse dataset that enhances the performance and generalization capabilities of navigation agents across diverse scenarios [4][5].

These include utilizing a speaker module (Fried et al. 2018; Dou and Peng 2022) to generate synthetic instructions, leveraging multilingual data (Li, Tan, and Bansal 2022a), incorporating counterfactual information (Wang et al. 2022; Parvaneh et al. 2020; Fu et al. 2020), and altering environments (Li, Tan, and Bansal 2022b; Liu et al. 2021). For outdoor VLN, previous studies have explored training agents on instructions with different styles (Zhu et al. 2021), pretraining on auxiliary tasks (Armitage, Impett, and Sennrich 2023) and using driving videos (Li et al. 2024). However, the use of auxiliary training data to tailor MLLMs for outdoor navigation remains largely

One notable contribution is the introduction of R2R dataset (Anderson et al., 2018), where a sequence-to-sequence LSTM model was used to solve the VLN task. A critical challenge in VLN is to develop agents that can generalize well in unseen environments. Since training data is limited, many approaches use data augmentation or introduce auxiliary tasks for improving data efficiency. Speaker-follower (Fried et al., 2018) models synthesize new instructions for data augmentation and implement pragmatic reasoning. EnvDrop (Tan et al., 2019) proposes an environmental dropout strategy to generate new environments. AuxRN (Zhu et al., 2020) trains the agent with self-supervised auxiliary reasoning tasks to leverage rich semantic information in the dataset. EnvEdit (Li et al.,

Nonetheless, many challenges exist in VLN tasks, including understanding and alignment of information from different modalities, reasoning strategies for navigation, the issue of data scarcity, and models’ generalization abilities in unseen environments [24]. To address these challenges, researchers have devised numerous strategies, encompassing representation learning [25, 10, 11], action strategy learning [4, 21], data-centric [7, 9, 26], and prior exploration [27, 28]. These approaches aim to improve models’ comprehension of multimodal information, facilitate informed decision-making, mitigate the impact of limited data, and enhance generalization to unseen environments.

We have thoroughly investigated overcoming the challenges of data scarcity and generalization in VLN tasks.II-B Data-centric VLN approachesData-centric approaches enhance VLN training resources by utilizing existing data or generating synthetic data. For Environment Augmentation, novel environments are crafted by randomly masking visual features across viewpoints [7], segmenting and recombining house scenes [29], or altering styles and objects [30]. Although the scenes are greatly enriched, they are still based on limited environments, and generating corresponding instructions for distinct visual features in different environments remains challenging. For Path-Instruction Augmentation, Fried [9] demonstrates that training a Speaker model to generate instructions based on specific navigation paths significantly improves agents’ performance.
