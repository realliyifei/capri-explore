## Answer (I don't know?: âœ“)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain specific information about Vision-and-Language Navigation or the augmentation techniques employed to improve data quality and diversity in that context. The passages focus primarily on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to math word problem solving, multimodal data integration, and question answering systems, without addressing Vision-and-Language Navigation directly or detailing associated augmentation strategies. Therefore, the context is insufficient to provide a precise answer to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: a challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This study aims to provide MWP solvers with a more diverse training set, ultimately improving their ability to solve various math problems. We propose several methods for data augmentation by modifying the problem texts and equations, such as synonym replacement, rule-based: question replacement, and rule based: reversing question methodologies over two English MWP datasets. This study extends by introducing a new in-context learning augmentation method, employing the Llama-7b language model. This approach involves instruction-based prompting for rephrasing the math problem texts. Performance evaluations are conducted on 9 baseline models, revealing that augmentation methods outperform baseline models. Moreover, concatenating examples generated by various augmentation methods further improves performance.keywords: Question Answering, Math Word Problem Solving, Data Augmentation, In-Context Learning, Llama-7b1
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: answering.The integration of multimodal data has opened up new possibilities for AI applications. MLLMs can generate detailed descriptions of images, providing valuable assistance in fields like accessibility and content creation. These models can answer questions about images, demonstrating their ability to understand and reason about visual content. MLLMs also enable the creation of rich multimedia content, combining text, images, and audio to produce engaging and informative outputs.The field of NLP has undergone significant transformations over the past few decades, driven by advancements in computational power, the availability of large-scale datasets, and breakthroughs in machine learning algorithms. This journey can be broadly categorized into several key phases:1.Rule-based systems (1950s-1980s): Early NLP approaches relied heavily on hand-crafted rules and linguistic knowledge bases. While these systems could perform well in narrow domains, they struggled with the
