## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not contain any specific information regarding kappa-like coefficients or how their interpretation may differ between medical research and computational linguistics. The passages focus on topics such as the role of NLP in AI applications, the use of large language models, and the construction of knowledge graphs, without delving into statistical methods or the nuances of interpreting coefficients in these different fields. Therefore, the context is insufficient to accurately address the question.

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has played a significant role in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications such as chatbots, text generation, and language translation. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has greatly improved the performance of these applications, showing astonishing results in language understanding and generation. However, they still show some disadvantages, such as hallucinations and lack of domain-specific knowledge, that affect their performance in real-world tasks.These issues can be effectively mitigated by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which organise information in structured formats that capture relationships between entities in a versatile and interpretable fashion. Likewise, the construction and validation of KGs present challenges that LLMs can help resolve. The complementary relationship between LLMs and KGs has led to a trend that combines these technologies to achieve trustworthy results. This work collected 28
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: construction of such knowledge bases is an interesting direction and requires many challenges to be addressed, such as knowledge coverage, factuality of the knowledge, knowledge linking, and so on. These challenges are amplified when the knowledge bases are constructed for specialized domains such as healthcare or chemistry. However, once these problems are addressed, researchers will be able to utilize LLMs to dynamically curate a knowledge base from up-to-date raw text and an ontology for complex applications such as tracking medication interactions from articles from PubMed.3.General and Cultural Commonsense. Cultural knowledge available in NLP models is often limited to a handful of Western cultures and does not account for the vast diversity of the cultural views of the world (Arora et al., 2023). With the increasingly wide spread of NLP applications, this limitation may result in direct adverse impact on the users of these applications, by not accounting for their values,
