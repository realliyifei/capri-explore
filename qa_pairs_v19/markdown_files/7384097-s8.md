## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not discuss syntax-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches or their utilization of tree structures. The passages focus on the general characteristics of SMT, its limitations, and the comparison with Neural Machine Translation (NMT), but they do not provide specific information regarding the syntactic aspects or how tree structures are employed in SMT. Thus, the content is insufficient to provide a well-supported answer to the question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: rules crafted by experts and extensive lexicons, but they were often labor-intensive and brittle when applied to complex languages. SMT, introduced in the 1990s, offered a data-driven approach, where models learned translation probabilities from bilingual text corpora. However, SMT required large volumes of parallel data, which was a significant limitation for low-resource languages, and its reliance on phrase-based techniques often failed to capture complex linguistic phenomena like morphology and syntax in underrepresented languages.With the advent of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), particularly sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with attention mechanisms, the field of Machine Translation entered a new era. NMT demonstrated superior performance over SMT in many language pairs by leveraging deep learning to create richer representations of source and target sentences. However, NMT’s effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of large datasets, making it less applicable
