Syntax-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches, particularly string-to-tree (s2t) translation methods, utilize tree structures in a way that distinguishes them from traditional phrase-based SMT methods. In traditional SMT, the translation focuses on phrases or strings without necessarily taking the underlying syntax into account, often leading to problems in maintaining valid grammatical structures in the target language. However, s2t approaches allow for the translation of a source-language string directly into a target-language tree structure, which ensures that the resulting translations adhere to proper syntactic rules [1].

One significant advantage of using tree structures in syntax-based SMT is the capability to preserve and leverage the syntactic information inherent in the data. By employing tree representations, these methods can maintain logical relationships and grammatical dependencies between different components of a sentence, which is especially critical for complex languages that exhibit intricate morphological and syntactic features [1] [3]. This ensures that the final translations not only capture the meaning of the source text but also reflect the grammaticality and coherence expected in the target language.

Furthermore, the use of trees allows for greater flexibility in reordering elements during translation. Since translation often involves moving words or phrases around to fit the target language's grammatical structure, having a tree representation provides a structured approach that facilitates this reordering in a way that respects the underlying syntax. This stands in contrast to the more rigid phrase-based SMT techniques that may struggle with extensive reordering due to their reliance on fixed reference phrases [1].

In addition, the different approaches within syntax-based SMT have been explored further through additional models that incorporate modern techniques. For example, methods that utilize graph convolution networks to extract dense vector representations from dependency trees highlight an innovative application of tree structures that can enhance translation quality by providing richer syntactic context [2]. The integration of linguistic features such as part-of-speech tags and dependency labels has also shown to improve the translation quality, indicating a trend towards combining deep linguistic insights with machine learning methods in achieving better translation efficacy [2] [3].

In summary, syntax-based SMT approaches make use of tree structures by translating strings to trees, ensuring valid syntactic structures, allowing for flexible reordering, and facilitating the capture of complex linguistic phenomena, thereby enhancing the overall quality of machine translations compared to traditional phrase-based approaches. This shift illustrates a significant evolution in translation technology, aligning with the increasing reliance on data-driven methodologies in natural language processing [3] [4].

A small-scale human evaluation also showed an advantage to the syntax-aware system.1 Introduction and ModelNeural Machine Translation (NMT)Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013); Sutskever et al. (2014); Bahdanau et al. (2014) has recently became the state-of-the-art approach to machine translation Bojar et al. (2016), while being much simpler than the previously dominant phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches Koehn (2010). NMT models usually do not make explicit use of syntactic information about the languages at hand. However, a large body of work was dedicated to syntax-based SMT Williams et al. (2016). One prominent approach to syntax-based SMT is string-to-tree (s2t) translation Yamada and Knight (2001, 2002), in which a source-language string is translated into a target-language tree. s2t approaches to SMT help to ensure the resulting translations have valid syntactic structure, while also mediating flexible reordering between the source and
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: (Lopez, 2008). Initially, rule-based approaches and statistical approaches were prevalent in this field and later neural machine translation (NMT) turned out to be a key milestone in the current era. Compared to other NLG tasks, machine translation requires less information from external sources as it is enforced to preserve the content during the conversion from the source language to the target language. However, enhancing the input to NMT with linguistic features such as morphological analysis, part-of-speech tags, and dependency labels is shown to improve the quality of the task (Sennrich and Haddow, 2016; Chen et al., 2018).Bastings et al. (2017) extended this idea by applying a graph convolution network on the dependency trees to obtain a dense vector representation for the sentence structure. Apart from utilizing the linguistic features,Chen et al. (2018) aided the translation using search engines by extracting similar source sentences and their corresponding translation.

SMT, introduced in the 1990s, offered a data-driven approach, where models learned translation probabilities from bilingual text corpora. However, SMT required large volumes of parallel data, which was a significant limitation for low-resource languages, and its reliance on phrase-based techniques often failed to capture complex linguistic phenomena like morphology and syntax in underrepresented languages.With the advent of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), particularly sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with attention mechanisms, the field of Machine Translation entered a new era.
