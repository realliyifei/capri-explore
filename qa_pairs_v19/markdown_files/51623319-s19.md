## Answer

I don't know. The context provided does not contain sufficient information regarding the specific syntactic types of antecedents and how these affect the choice between using "it" or "that" in anaphora. While the context discusses anaphora resolution, pronoun usage, and antecedent identification, it does not explicitly address how different syntactic characteristics influence this particular decision in language use. The details on pronoun functions and types do not encompass the intricacies of selecting between "it" and "that," nor do they explain any systematic approach to this choice based on antecedent syntax. Therefore, I cannot offer a well-supported answer to the question.

[1]: Passage ID 1: plausible candidates and – if disregarding syntax – discriminates candidates using deeper features.1 IntroductionCurrent research in anaphora (or coreference) resolution is focused on resolving noun phrases referring to concrete objects or entities in the real world, which is arguably the most frequently occurring type. Distinct from these are diverse types of abstract anaphora (AA) Asher (1993) where reference is made to propositions, facts, events or properties. An example is given in (1) below.111Example drawn from ARRAU (Uryupina et al., 2016).While recent approaches addresstheresolution of selected abstract shell nouns (Kolhatkar and Hirst, 2014),we aimto resolve a wide range of abstract anaphors, such as the NPthis trend in (1),as well as pronominal anaphors (this, that, or it).Henceforth, we refer to a sentence that contains an abstract anaphor as the anaphoric sentence (AnaphS), and to a constituent that the anaphor refers to as the antecedent (Antec)

A typical case is shown in example 2.2..{exe}\exFOXP3 is an essential transcription factor …; however, the mechanismsregulating its expression are as yet unknown.Most of the variables useful for open-domain pronoun resolution are irrelevant here,particularly gender, person, and animacy, since the entities and events mentioned are invariably referred to as neuter,3rd person, and inanimate in English (it, its, them, etc.). However, pronoun number remains crucial, in that it denotes how many antecedents to link to.Following ?), we use a simple heuristic for finding the antecedent of these expressions, starting from the beginning of the current sentence and traveling linearly rightward until an appropriate mention (or mentions) is reached. If insufficient mentions are found this way, we traverse the immediately previous sentence left to right. Unlike
[3]: Passage ID 3: antecedent resolution. This algorithm started with parsing each sentence in the text, POS tagging and lemmatizing it. These linguistic features were stored in an internal data structure. This global data structure was appended with some other features like base nouns, number agreement, person name identification, gender, animacy, etc. This model also constructed a finite state machine with the aim of identifying the NPs. The parsed sentence was then sequentially checked for anaphoric references and pleonastic it occurrences. The remaining mentions were considered as possible candidates for antecedents and were heuristically evaluated using a scoring function. The toolkit was extensively evaluated on reportage, editorials, reviews, religion, fiction, etc.As the research in CR started to shift towards machine learning algorithms which used classification and ranking it slowly became clear that to beat the machine learning systems, rules had to be ordered according to their importance.

It has a touch screen.Peter got a ticket that Paul wanted to buy. It is for Saturday night.…Adding to this semantic peculiarity, the dependency of anaphors with respect to their antecedents may exhibit the syntactic peculiarity of being a long-distance relation. This is illustrated with the set of contrasts below, that could be continued at will, where the anaphor her and its antecedent anaphor Mary can be separated by a string of words of arbitrary length.\isit examplesMary thinks that Peter saw her.Mary thinks that John knows that Peter saw her.Mary thinks that Paul believes that John thinks that Peter saw her.…In large enough contexts, an anaphoric expression may have moreadmissible antecedents than the antecedent that happento eventually co-specify its interpretation. This receivesa minimal example in the
[5]: Passage ID 5: antecedents [8]. At the top level the categories capturepronoun function. Anaphoric pronouns refer to an antecedent.Event reference pronouns may refer to a verb, verb phrase, clause, oran entire sentence. Pleonastic pronouns, in contrast, do not refer toanything. Addressee reference pronouns are used to refer to thereader/audience:anaphoric: I have a bicycle. It is red.event: He lost his job. It came as a total surprise.pleonastic: It is raining.addressee reference: You’re welcome.More fine-grained categories are derived from additional annotated features:the pronoun’s surface form, singular vs. plural use, subject vs. non-subjectposition, and whether the antecedent is a group noun, an anaphoric pronoun isinter- or intra-sentential, and an addressee reference pronoun refers tospecific people (deictic) or to people in general (generic).3 Data SetThe core part of our data set consists of one rule-based MT and four SMT systemsthat participated in the shared task
