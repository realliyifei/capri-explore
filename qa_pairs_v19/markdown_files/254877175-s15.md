## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not mention the SVAMP dataset nor specifically evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on it. Additionally, the references mainly discuss model performance evaluation on other datasets and general trends in NLP without addressing consistency or discrepancies in model performance on the SVAMP dataset in particular. Therefore, there is insufficient information to accurately answer the question regarding the effectiveness of these models on the SVAMP dataset.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted a large scale evaluation on four datasets, collected from the real world technical Q&A sites (i.e., Ask Ubuntu, Super User, Stack Overflow Python andStack Overflow Java). Our experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in automatic evaluation. We also conducted a user study with 50 solved/unanswered/unresolved questions. The user study results demonstrate that our approach is effective in solving the answer hungry problem by recommending the most relevant answers from historical archives.CQA, Question Boosting, Question Answering, Sequence-to-sequence, Deep Neural Network, Weakly Supervised Learning††journal: TOSEM††journalvolume: 9††journalnumber: 4††article: 39††journalyear: 2019††publicationmonth: 3††articleseq: 9††copyright: acmlicensed††doi: 0000001.0000001††ccs: Software and its engineering Software evolution††ccs: Software and its

3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: familiar with all existing fields of study and struggle to phrase their queries using the correct terminology. Due to the absence of datasets that map search goals expressed in layman’s terms to NLP topics, we created a synthetic multi-class dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo (version: 0613) OpenAI (2022). We prompted the LLM to generate questions on the 12 main topics in our taxonomy using three distinct personas: a computer science student with only peripheral NLP knowledge, a businessperson with practical experience of NLP tools but minimal technical expertise, and a non-technical, non-academic individual whose technology use is limited to basic tasks. Persona-specific prompting yielded diverse inquiries in layman’s language. For example, the question “How are computers able to respond when we ask them questions?” was generated for the topic Natural Language Interfaces. To account for questions unrelated to NLP, we also generated a set of out-of-scope questions such as “Who discovered the

Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and early neural networks became popular for tasks like text classification and named entity recognition. These approaches allowed models to learn from labeled data, where patterns and relationships could be automatically extracted from examples rather than being manually coded as in rule-based systems.According to [mi2016supervised], SVMs, for instance, worked by finding hyperplanes that best separated data into different classes, excelling in high-dimensional spaces common in NLP applications. They were especially useful for binary classification tasks, such as determining whether a document belongs to a certain category, like spam detection in emails. Decision Trees, on the other hand, divided data into increasingly smaller subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure that could be easily interpreted and adapted to a variety of tasks.Early neural networks
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: a large number of questions remain unanswered or unresolved, and users have to wait for a long time or painstakingly go through the provided answers with various levels of quality.To alleviate this time-consuming problem, we propose a novel DeepAns neural network-based approach to identify the most relevant answer among a set of answer candidates. Our approach follows a three-stage process: question boosting, label establishment, and answer recommendation. Given a post, we first generate a clarifying question as a way of question boosting. We automatically establish the positive, neutral+, neutral- and negative training samples via label establishment. When it comes to answer recommendation, we sort answer candidates by the matching scores calculated by our neural network-based model. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted a large scale evaluation on four datasets, collected from the real world technical Q&A sites (i.e., Ask Ubuntu, Super User, Stack Overflow
