## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided does not mention the SVAMP dataset or any specific performance metrics related to state-of-the-art deep learning models on this dataset. The discussion focuses on general performance benchmarks of various models and evaluation methods in NLP, but there is no direct information about SVAMP or insights into the consistency of model performances on that particular dataset.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: human-like text, answer complex questions, and perform a wide array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Models such as GPT (Achiam et al., 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), Baichuan (Yang et al., 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), GLM (Du et al., 2022), and DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024) have set new standards, demonstrating exceptional performance across various benchmarks. These models have been widely adopted in both academic and industrial settings, highlighting their versatility and potential. However, the evaluation of LLMs is a multifaceted challenge that extends beyond mere accuracy in answering questions. It involves assessing their ability to understand context, generate coherent and relevant responses, and apply specialized knowledge effectively.Evaluation BenchmarksThe evaluation of LLMs has traditionally relied on established NLP benchmark datasets, such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), which focus
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: techniques, improved various NLP tasks significantly. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and early neural networks became popular for tasks like text classification and named entity recognition. These approaches allowed models to learn from labeled data, where patterns and relationships could be automatically extracted from examples rather than being manually coded as in rule-based systems.According to [mi2016supervised], SVMs, for instance, worked by finding hyperplanes that best separated data into different classes, excelling in high-dimensional spaces common in NLP applications. They were especially useful for binary classification tasks, such as determining whether a document belongs to a certain category, like spam detection in emails. Decision Trees, on the other hand, divided data into increasingly smaller subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure that could be easily interpreted and adapted to a variety of tasks.Early neural networks

Our implementation is available on https://github.com/HEmile/iswc-challenge.1 IntroductionLanguage Models (LMs) have been at the center of attention, presented as a recent success story of Artificial Intelligence. LMs have shown great promise across a wide range of domains in a variety of different tasks, such as Text Classification [1], Financial Sentiment Analysis [2], and Protein Binding Site Prediction [3]).In recent years, prompt engineering for LMs has become a research field in itself, with a plethora of papers working on LM understanding (e.g. [4]).Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers have recently investigated whether LMs could potentially be used as Knowledge Bases, by querying for particular information. In Petroni et al. [5], the LAMA dataset for probing relational facts from Wikidata in LMs was presented. The authors show that the masked LM BERT can complete Wikidata facts with a precision of around
