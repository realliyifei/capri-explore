## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Recent advancements aimed at overcoming the limitations of the end-to-end model in pronoun coreference resolution include both improved models and the integration of additional methodologies.

1. **Enhancements in the End-to-End Model**: Recent improvements over the end-to-end model focus on refining its architecture and capabilities. While the original end-to-end model operates without human-defined rules and achieves notable performance, there are ongoing efforts to enhance the system further. Various modifications have been proposed that might involve advancements in the underlying deep learning frameworks or optimization techniques that could improve the model's accuracy and efficiency in resolving pronouns [1] [2].

2. **Incorporation of Knowledge and Rules**: Despite the initial premise of the end-to-end model to avoid manual rules, integrating knowledge and heuristic rules from linguistic features is recognized as beneficial. Human-designed rules are still crucial for specific pronouns; for example, a rule clarifying that "he" refers only to males and "she" to females underlines the relevance of domain knowledge in perfecting resolution accuracy [2][3]. By combining deep learning methods with effective rules and features, the models can better handle exceptions and subtle nuances in language context.

3. **Advanced Machine Learning Approaches**: There has been a shift towards employing advanced machine learning models that learn from data rather than relying solely on predefined features. For instance, entity-centric approaches have been utilized to develop policies for incrementally building coreference chains, enhancing the capability of models to manage context dynamically [1]. This adaptation allows for improved handling of coreference resolution tasks, particularly in complex scenarios where traditional methods struggle.

4. **Research Focus on Hard Pronoun Resolution**: Ongoing research highlights the challenges posed by hard pronoun resolution problems, as seen in benchmarks like the Winograd Schema Challenge. Current models are found to perform well in standard evaluation sets but falter in real-world applications, especially with less frequent objects [3]. Addressing these challenges motivates continuous research to refine algorithms and expand training datasets that better represent varied linguistic contexts.

5. **Neural Network Innovations**: Emerging approaches, particularly in other languages, are leveraging neural networks to create more robust systems. For example, advancements in Persian pronoun resolution utilize Transformer models like ParsBERT in an end-to-end manner, optimizing both mention detection and antecedent linking [5]. This paradigm suggests a trend towards more integrated systems that not only perform coreference but also learn from extensive linguistic data, which may inspire similar developments in other languages and domains.

In summary, recent advancements in overcoming the limitations of the end-to-end model in pronoun coreference resolution revolve around enhancements in model architecture, the incorporation of linguistic knowledge and rules, adoption of advanced machine learning techniques, targeted research on difficult cases, and innovations in neural network applications. These efforts represent significant strides toward achieving more effective and contextually aware coreference resolution systems.

Besides that, a novel model was also proposed to predict coreference relations with a deep reinforcement learning framework [26].Moreover, heuristic rules based on linguistic knowledge can also be incorporated into constraints for machine learning models [27].2.2.2 End-to-end ModelLeveraging human-designed rules or features can help accurately resolve some pronouns, but it is hard to manually design rules to cover all cases.To solve this problem, an end-to-end deep model [9] was proposed.Different from other machine learning-based methods, it does not use any human-defined rules, yet achieves surprisingly good performance.Specifically, the end-to-end model first leverages the combination of Bi-directional LSTM and inner-attention modules to encode local context and generate representations for

After that, we briefly introduce a few recent improvements over the end-to-end model.2.2.1 Rule and Feature Based MethodsBefore the deep learning era, human-designed rules [2, 19], knowledge [20, 21], or features [3, 22] dominated the general coreference resolution and PCR tasks. Some rules and features are crucial for correctly resolving pronouns [23]. For example, ‘he’ can only refer to males and ‘she’ can only refer to females; ‘it’ can only refer to singular objects and ‘them’ can only refer to plural objects.The performances of these methods heavily rely on the coverage and quality of the manually defined rules and features.Based on these designed features [24], a few more advanced machine learning models were applied to the coreference resolution task. For example, instead of identifying coreference relation pair-wisely, [25] proposes an entity-centric coreference system that can learn an effective policy for building coreference chains incrementally. Besides that,

Jonnalagadda and Mamidi (2015) proposed a rule-based system for anaphora resolution in Telugu dialog systems, After preprocessing the data using Morphological analyzer and POS tagger they used a set of hard-coded rules to deal with different types of pronouns.Clark (2015) has done pioneering work in coreference resolution using deep learning that automatically learns dense vector representations for mention pairs for English and Chinese. He built them using the word embeddings in the mention and surrounding context, which will maintain the semantic similarity. Despite using a few hand-engineered features, he trained an incremental coreference system that can utilize entity-level information. His mention pair model acted as an inspiration for our feature representations, and we updated it for free word order
