## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Recent advancements in overcoming the limitations of end-to-end models in pronoun coreference resolution have primarily focused on integrating improved architectures and methodologies to enhance performance and address existing challenges.

One of the significant enhancements is the introduction of an end-to-end neural network system explicitly designed for Persian pronoun resolution, which utilizes pre-trained Transformer models such as ParsBERT. This approach jointly optimizes mention detection and antecedent linking, which are often treated as distinct tasks in previous models. By combining these tasks, the proposed system achieves a notable F1 score of 3.37, indicating a measurable improvement in performance over traditional methods that may overlook critical information by splitting the tasks [1].

Additionally, the field has seen advancements through various neural-based approaches that emphasize the use of deep learning techniques. For instance, a review of the literature reveals the evolution of models, ranging from span-based end-to-end architectures to those formulated as question-answering problems. These models benefit from substantial annotated training data, allowing deep neural networks to automatically learn essential features, which has led to state-of-the-art results in English benchmarks [3]. However, there is a noted gap in research focused on non-English languages, which remains an area for further exploration [3].

Moreover, recent studies highlight the need for improved training datasets and evaluation metrics to effectively tackle the unique challenges of coreference resolution. The limited size of existing datasets (such as ECB+ with only 984 documents) constrains model performance, especially as coreference resolution is inherently dependent on the amount of available training data for various languages [4]. Thus, expanding the training corpus is crucial for further advancements.

Furthermore, the application of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-2 and GPT-Neo demonstrates their valid responses in coreference resolution tasks, although they exhibit limitations in identifying coreferent mentions reliably. These models are sensitive to prompts, leading to inconsistencies in results, which indicates an area still ripe for improvement [4]. 

To further augment the capabilities of coreference models, ongoing work is exploring prompt-based coreference resolution techniques, in which candidates for resolution (typically pronouns) will be provided as inputs, utilizing both zero and few-shot learning frameworks. This strategic approach is aimed at enhancing model performance when access to labeled data is sparse [5].

In summary, advancements in end-to-end models for pronoun coreference resolution are evolving through improved architectures that combine tasks, leveraging large-scale annotated datasets, and exploring the strengths of LLMs in prompt-based frameworks. These advancements aim to address limitations such as data dependency and model sensitivity, fostering a more robust and effective approach to resolving pronouns in various languages.

(2017, 2018) to formulating the task as a question answering problem Wu et al. (2020b). Given enough annotated training data, deep neural networks can learn to extract useful features automatically. As a result, on English benchmarks with abundant labeled training documents, the mentioned neural methods consistently outperform previous handcrafted feature-based techniques Raghunathan et al. (2010); Lee et al. (2013), achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.Figure 1: An overview of our framework. We first train several coreference resolution models using different TL approaches. During inference, we use a simple unweighted averaging method to combine the models’ predictions.Compared to the amount of research on English coreference resolution, there is relatively little work for other languages.

Our experiments show that GPT-2 and GPT-Neo can return valid answers, but that their capabilities to identify coreferent mentions are limited and prompt-sensitive, leading to inconsistent results.1 IntroductionCoreference resolution (CR) aims to identify and cluster all words (i.e., mentions) that refer to the same entity or event. Solving this task is essential for natural language understanding, as mismatched references will lead to bias. Recent improvements in CR have been incremental (Lee et al., 2017; Joshi et al., 2020; Cattan et al., 2020), compared to other NLP tasks that have demonstrated more real-world impact. One reason is the limited training corpora. For example, one of the primary datasets, ECB+ (Cybulska and Vossen, 2014), contains only 984 documents, including 6,833 mentions and 2,741 clusters. Moreover, this dataset was built around 43 news topics ten

Finally, we explore the generalization ability of this approach by extending our analysis to a diverse range of domains, languages, and time periods. Our results indicate that continued learning should still be the preferred option if a large out-of-domain corpus and a few annotated in-domain documents are available. However, large instruction-tuned LMs can generalize surprisingly well across domains and languages, making them a robust option if no target language or in-domain data is available for fine-tuning.2 Prompt-based Coreference ResolutionPrevious work in zero- and few-shot coreference resolution assumes access to candidate mentions to resolve, usually pronouns in the passage Ouyang et al. (2022); Agrawal et al. (2022). We adopt this formulation: given a document, we assume the existence of a set of candidate mentions (gold or predicted), then prompt an autoregressive
