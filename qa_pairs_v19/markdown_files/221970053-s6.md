## Answer

Recent advancements aimed at overcoming the limitations of the end-to-end model in pronoun coreference resolution primarily focus on enhancing the model’s capabilities and approaching the task from innovative angles. One notable direction is the incorporation of recent improvements over the end-to-end model, although specific details of these improvements aren't explicitly detailed in the provided passages [2]. 

First, we can highlight the transition from rule-based or feature-based models to end-to-end models. Traditionally, coreference resolution heavily relied on human-designed rules and knowledge, which meant that their effectiveness was contingent upon the comprehensiveness and quality of these rules [2] [3]. The end-to-end model alleviates the issues associated with manual rule design by leveraging deep learning architectures, such as Bi-directional LSTM and inner-attention modules, to accurately encode local context and generate representations for pronouns without requiring predefined rules [1].

However, the end-to-end model still has its limitations, particularly when dealing with rare or infrequent objects and more nuanced pronoun reference cases, as outlined in the ongoing challenges with models that continue to struggle in real-world applications, like those related to the Winograd Schema Challenge [3]. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring the integration of more sophisticated machine learning techniques and improvements in model architectures that emphasize understanding commonsense knowledge, which is crucial for accurate pronoun reference resolution [2] [3].

Moreover, the exploration of hybrid approaches, combining traditional methods with deep learning, is also being further examined. For example, hybrid models that incorporate dependency parsing and decision tree classifiers show promising results in languages such as Hindi [4], suggesting that combining rule-based systems with deep learning can enhance performance in different linguistic contexts. 

Another aspect to consider is the incorporation of pre-trained language models to enhance the end-to-end systems. More recent studies have started leveraging advances in transformer models (e.g., ParsBERT for Persian resolution tasks) that optimize both mention detection and antecedent linking simultaneously, yielding better performance metrics [5]. Such models address the limitations of treating pronoun resolution as a separate task from mention detection, thus capitalizing on the interconnectedness of these processes to enable a more comprehensive understanding of context and relationships between entities.

In summary, advancements to address the limitations of the end-to-end model in pronoun coreference resolution include the integration of improved model architectures, the use of hybrid systems that combine traditional and modern approaches, and the application of pre-trained transformer models. These efforts collectively aim to enhance understanding and resolution efficacy in complex pronoun relationships that current models find challenging [3][5].

Besides that, a novel model was also proposed to predict coreference relations with a deep reinforcement learning framework [26].Moreover, heuristic rules based on linguistic knowledge can also be incorporated into constraints for machine learning models [27].2.2.2 End-to-end ModelLeveraging human-designed rules or features can help accurately resolve some pronouns, but it is hard to manually design rules to cover all cases.To solve this problem, an end-to-end deep model [9] was proposed.Different from other machine learning-based methods, it does not use any human-defined rules, yet achieves surprisingly good performance.Specifically, the end-to-end model first leverages the combination of Bi-directional LSTM and inner-attention modules to encode local context and generate representations for

After that, we briefly introduce a few recent improvements over the end-to-end model.2.2.1 Rule and Feature Based MethodsBefore the deep learning era, human-designed rules [2, 19], knowledge [20, 21], or features [3, 22] dominated the general coreference resolution and PCR tasks. Some rules and features are crucial for correctly resolving pronouns [23]. For example, ‘he’ can only refer to males and ‘she’ can only refer to females; ‘it’ can only refer to singular objects and ‘them’ can only refer to plural objects.The performances of these methods heavily rely on the coverage and quality of the manually defined rules and features.Based on these designed features [24], a few more advanced machine learning models were applied to the coreference resolution task. For example, instead of identifying coreference relation pair-wisely, [25] proposes an entity-centric coreference system that can learn an effective policy for building coreference chains incrementally. Besides that,

Jonnalagadda and Mamidi (2015) proposed a rule-based system for anaphora resolution in Telugu dialog systems, After preprocessing the data using Morphological analyzer and POS tagger they used a set of hard-coded rules to deal with different types of pronouns.Clark (2015) has done pioneering work in coreference resolution using deep learning that automatically learns dense vector representations for mention pairs for English and Chinese. He built them using the word embeddings in the mention and surrounding context, which will maintain the semantic similarity. Despite using a few hand-engineered features, he trained an incremental coreference system that can utilize entity-level information. His mention pair model acted as an inspiration for our feature representations, and we updated it for free word order
