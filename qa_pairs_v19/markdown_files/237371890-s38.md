## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Transliteration and alphabet mapping are essential techniques in machine translation (MT), especially for languages that employ different scripts. These methodologies facilitate the conversion of text between various writing systems, enabling better communication and understanding across multilingual contexts.

Transliteration is the process of converting words from one script to another while preserving their phonetic characteristics. This technique is particularly valuable in MT for overcoming the script barrier. For instance, Bhat et al. (2016) developed machine transliteration models specifically for Hindi and Urdu, utilizing both Devanagari and Perso-Arabic scripts. Their work demonstrated significant improvements in the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, highlighting how transliteration can enhance translation quality between languages that use different scripts [4]. The authors noted that employing a dependency parser trained on augmented resources led to better performance compared to using individual resources.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that leveraging orthographic similarities can significantly improve transliteration effectiveness. Kunchukuttan et al. (2018b) highlighted this by demonstrating that multilingual transliteration—utilizing languages with similar writing systems and phonetic properties—tends to outperform bilingual transliteration in various scenarios [5]. This is particularly relevant for related languages, such as Indo-Aryan languages, where shared orthographic and phonetic features can be exploited to enhance computational models.

In addition to direct transliteration, alphabet mapping processes are crucial for the normalization of scripts in MT systems. Nakov and Ng (2009) utilized transliteration as a preprocessing step in their phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) model to manage systematic spelling variations, indicating the importance of consistent script representation in improving translation accuracy [2]. Further, converting scripts to a common format, such as Latin or Devanagari, allows the development of multilingual models that are trained on both source and target languages represented in the same script. This approach not only alleviates issues associated with script variation but also facilitates code-switching, where speakers switch between languages within a conversation, thereby improving the robustness of MT systems [2].

Additionally, recent innovations in deep learning, such as the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), have enhanced the capabilities of transliteration models, allowing them to better capture complex phonetic relationships and improve overall transliteration quality for diverse language pairs [3]. The combination of traditional rule-based methods with modern deep learning approaches has been found to yield high-quality results in transliteration tasks, supporting the assertion that continuous advancements in NLP technology significantly enhance MT systems' efficacy [3].

In conclusion, transliteration and alphabet mapping serve as foundational components in machine translation for languages with different scripts. By enabling script conversion and enhancing phonological alignment, these techniques play a crucial role in ensuring effective communication across diverse linguistic landscapes. Their integration into MT systems leads to improved accuracy, helping bridge communication gaps in multilingual societies.

One of the sub-parts of NLP is Machine Translation (MT). MT has been the most promising application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) since the invention of computers, which has has been shown to increase access to information by the native language of the speakers in many cases. One of the such critical case is the spread of vital information during a crisis or emergency (Lewis et al., 2011; Neubig and Hu, 2018). Recently, translation accuracy has increased, and commercial systems have gained popularity.
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: for translation system. Nakov and Ng (2009) use transliteration as a preprocessing step for their phrase-based SMT model to tackle systematic spelling variation. Both  Chakravarthi et al. (2019) and  Koneru et al. (2021) convert Dravidian languages to Latin script and train multilingual models with both source and target in Latin script; the latter identify code-switching to be a challenge during back-transliteration. Besides converting to Latin script,  Dabre et al. (2018) use another common script, Devanagari, for Indic languages.In addition to the natural written scripts, previous works also explored artificial script, such as IPA.  Liu et al. (2019) incorporate phonetic representations, specifically for Chinese Pinyin, to cope with homophone noise. Unlike our work,  Chakravarthi et al. (2019) adopt transliteration to IPA for both the source and target.Apart from transliterated input, other potential alternative signals we did not fully explored include orthographic syllable

Later on, it also has been used for similar purposes, but with intra-language perspective, describing it as a conversion of words from one written script to another one within the same language [2, 4].Instances of early works on transliteration can be Arabic-English names transliteration using a combination of a rule-based system with neural networks [1], and Japanese-English using finite state transducers [5]. Both approaches dealt with phonetic representations of words, which were replaced by a spelling-based approach to achieve higher results, as in the case of the Arabic-English model of [6].Later modern approaches to transliteration include models with long short-term memories (LSTM) [4], and recurrent neural networks (RNN) [7], which perform equally well. Combination of old rule-based approaches with recent deep-learning methods improves the quality, according to a comparative study [8].Transliteration
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: To remove the script barrier, Bhat et al. (2016) created machine transliteration models for the common orthographic representation of Hindi and Urdu text. The authors have transliterated text in both directions between Devanagari script (used to write the Hindi language) and Perso-Arabic script (used to write the Urdu language). The authors have demonstrated that a dependency parser trained on augmented resources performs better than individual resources. The authors have shown that there was a significant improvement in BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) (Papineni et al., 2002) score and have shown that the problem of data sparsity is reduced.Recent work by Kunchukuttan et al. (2018b) has explored orthographic similarity for transliteration. In their work, they have used related languages which share similar writing systems and phonetic properties such as Indo-Aryan languages.

5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: which share similar writing systems and phonetic properties such as Indo-Aryan languages. They have shown that multilingual transliteration leveraging similar orthography outperforms bilingual transliteration in different scenarios. Phonetic transcription is a method for writing a language in the other scripts keeping the phonemic units intact. It is extensively used in speech processing research, text-to-speech, and speech database construction — phonetic transcription to common script has shown to improve the results of machine translation (Chakravarthi et al., 2018). The authors focus on the multilingual translation of languages which uses different scripts and studies the effect of different orthographies to common script with multilingual NMT.Multiway NMT system was created for Czech and Polish with Czech IPA transcription and Polish transcription to a 3-way parallel text together to take advantage of the phonology of the closely related languages (Chen and Avgustinova, 2019).
