## Answer

## I don't know?: True

I don't know. The provided context focuses on the challenges and limitations in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for speech comprehension and generation, particularly in the context of general speech datasets and the architecture of conversational models. However, the context does not specifically mention Mandarin speech recognition systems or the distinct challenges associated with using decoupled approaches in that particular domain. Therefore, it is insufficient to answer the question regarding challenges and limitations in Mandarin speech recognition systems.

[1]: Passage ID 1: in full-duplex systems remains a significant challenge. Moreover, enhancing LLMs to effectively handle the speech modality—mastering both speech comprehension and generation—while maintaining robust natural language text processing capabilities, is hindered by the limited size of labeled speech datasets. These datasets are far smaller compared to the vast amounts of pure text data available, which risks diminishing the models’ original text processing capabilities. Thus, building a truly end-to-end conversational model that meets real-world requirements necessitates careful consideration of model architecture, training paradigms, and training data. Overall, we believe that several key aspects are crucial in the training paradigm of spoken dialogue models: aligning speech-text modalities to ensure consistent understanding, designing multi-stage training strategies for gradual adaptation, and optimizing training structures and inference paradigms for efficient performance.4.1

[4]: Passage ID 4: and the recent trend to explore Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task (?), there remains a notable gap in the field’s foundational understanding of the challenges when processing conversation transcripts.While research papers introduce techniques addressing similar challenges, their definitions and interpretations of these challenges can vary markedly.For instance, while some describe the informal and ungrammatical nature of spoken language as a language challenge (?, ?), others frame the challenge as different individual styles and unstructured expressions (?, ?).Both points of view are thereby valid but, on their own, focus just on a subpart of the language challenge and blur the understanding of it.Current surveys leave out the challenges in dialogue summarization and their variations in definitions, focusing instead on details on datasets, metrics, and techniques.As a consequence, there is no clear understanding of which aspects of dialogue summarization are
