## Answer (I don't know?: ✓)

I don't know. The context provided primarily discusses general challenges in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for speech modalities, including the limitations of labeled speech datasets, model architecture, and training paradigms in the context of building end-to-end conversational models. However, it does not explicitly address challenges and limitations associated with using decoupled approaches in Mandarin speech recognition systems, making it insufficient to provide a precise answer to your question.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: in full-duplex systems remains a significant challenge. Moreover, enhancing LLMs to effectively handle the speech modality—mastering both speech comprehension and generation—while maintaining robust natural language text processing capabilities, is hindered by the limited size of labeled speech datasets. These datasets are far smaller compared to the vast amounts of pure text data available, which risks diminishing the models’ original text processing capabilities. Thus, building a truly end-to-end conversational model that meets real-world requirements necessitates careful consideration of model architecture, training paradigms, and training data. Overall, we believe that several key aspects are crucial in the training paradigm of spoken dialogue models: aligning speech-text modalities to ensure consistent understanding, designing multi-stage training strategies for gradual adaptation, and optimizing training structures and inference paradigms for efficient performance.4.1

4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: the Mandarin-English SEAME corpus for bilingual, and the Common Voice for multilingual models. A review of different speech datasets detailing the number of languages, duration, and availability is depicted. Various augmentation techniques like SpecAugment, noise injection, and speed and length perturbation are applied across mono, bi, multi, and cross-lingual models to enhance robustness. (4) analysis of popular speech transformers, their parameters, and their utilization in different lingualism techniques. (5) we discuss challenges and future directions such as computational requirements, robustness, generalization, language mismatch, and multimodal learning. Future research should focus on enhancing cross-lingual/multilingual systems and addressing the performance challenges identified in this review. These findings and recommendations aim to guide researchers and developers in the speech-processing field, particularly emphasising expanding the capabilities and accessibility of ASR
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: and linguistic capabilities8 Discussion: Open Challenges and Future Research DirectionsThe promising architecture of deep learning frameworks and transformers significantly impacts the advancement of speech or audio processing. We particularly focus on various levels of lingualism, especially for low-resource language requiring a multi-facet approach. To the best of our knowledge, we cover extensively all the state-of-art research based on the monolingual in section 3, bi-lingual in section 4, multilingual in section 5 and cross-lingual in section 6. However, we still believe in the need for resources or scarcity of resources to build ASR for low-resource languages. This linguality perspective, explored in this paper, faces many key challenges and opens the avenue for further research in this domain.DatasetLanguagesDurationMonoBiMultiCrossOpen sourceLibrispeech [141]EN960h✓✓✓✓✓Google
