## Answer (I don't know?: ✗)

Errors in grammatical error correction (GEC) are classified in various ways and face significant challenges, particularly concerning annotation schemes. Generally, existing literature presents several classification schemes that categorize errors based on their nature and whether they can be automatically detected or need human intervention. For instance, prominent researchers have identified multiple error types including spelling errors, grammar (syntax) errors, style errors, and semantic errors [2]. Specifically, some classifications provide insights into agreement errors, real-word spelling errors, missing word errors, and extra word errors [2]. Further, Yuan's doctoral thesis mentions five types of errors: lexical, syntactic, semantic, discourse, and pragmatic errors [2].

To correct these errors, systems typically utilize various annotation schemes that aim to modify errorful texts minimally while maintaining the original meaning. This includes addressing spelling and more complex discourse-level errors, which may not always reflect traditional grammatical issues [3]. In practice, GEC systems are evaluated based on their ability to correct numerous types of errors, leading to a broad definition of what constitutes "grammatical" error correction, sometimes referred to as "Language Error" correction to better encompass this variety [3]. 

The major classification methods employed in GEC can be broadly categorized into three groups: rule-based techniques, machine learning-based techniques, and hybrid techniques. Each has its advantages and challenges. Rule-based techniques are particularly beneficial for language learning but require labor-intensive rule designing [1][4]. Machine learning techniques can reduce some of this labor but are dependent on the quality and size of the corpus used for training [1][4]. Hybrid approaches aim to combine the strengths of both methods but necessitate careful implementation based on specific suitability [1][4].

One of the key challenges with annotation schemes in GEC is the variability in their complexity and distinctions. Some schemes, like NUCLE, may have around two dozen categories, while others might detail almost a hundred [5]. This variability can lead to discrepancies in how errors are annotated and subsequently corrected, as different schemes have varying definitions of error spans and suggested corrections [5]. Consequently, differing annotation standards can impact the performance and accuracy of GEC systems, making it difficult to compare results across studies and applications effectively.

In summary, errors in GEC are classified into several types that reflect their specific characteristics, and correction approaches depend heavily on the underlying annotation schemes. However, the diversity and complexity of these schemes introduce significant challenges that need to be addressed for more effective and consistent error correction in natural language processing.

1. [1]:  Passage ID 1: are best suited for language learning but rule designing is a laborious task. Machine learning alleviates this labor but it is dependent on the size and type of the corpus used. Hybrid technique combines the best of both techniques but each part of the hybrid technique should be implemented according to its suitability.In this paper, we have also presented an error classification scheme which identifies five types of errors namely sentence structure errors, punctuation errors, spelling errors, syntax errors, and semantic errors. These errors are further subcategorized. This classification scheme would help the researchers and developers in following ways: (1) identifying the most frequent errors would tell what type of errors must be targeted for correction, (2) identifying the level of the error would tell what length of text should be examined to detect any error, (3) identifying the cause of invalid text would help in finding a solution to write a valid text. This simplifies the
2. [2]:  Passage ID 2: researchers have classified the errors in the corpus based on whether they are automatically detectable or needs human assistance. Naber(Naber, 2003) classifies various errors into four types namely spelling errors, style errors, grammar (syntax) errors and semantic errors. Wagner et al(Wagneret al., 2007) reports four types of errors namely agreement errors, real word spelling errors(contextual errors), missing word errors and extra word errors. Lee et al(Lee and Seneff, 2008) reports two types of errors namely syntax errors and semantic errors. Z Yuan in her doctoral thesis(Yuan, 2017) states five types of errors namely lexical errors, syntactic errors, semantic errors, discourse errors and pragmatic errors. Other than this, there is no general classification of grammar errors to the best of our knowledge. However an overview of major types of errors can be found in many web articles. Thus, we are highly motivated to suggest an error classification scheme. Please see figures 2 and
3. [3]:  Passage ID 3: practice, the task has increasingly been defined in terms of whatcorrections are annotated in corpora used for the shared tasks. Theseuse a variety of annotation schemes but all tend to adopt minimalmodifications of errorful texts to create error-free text with thesame perceived meaning. Other sources of annotated data, such as thatsourced from the online language learning platform Lang-8 (Mizumoto et al., 2012; Tajiri, Komachi, and Matsumoto, 2012), often contain much moreextensive rewrites of entire paragraphs of text. Given thisresource-derived definition of the task, systems are evaluated ontheir ability to correct all kinds of mistakes in text, including spelling and discourse level errors that have no or little grammatical reflex. The term ‘Grammatical’ Error Correction is thus something of a misnomer, but is nevertheless now commonly understood to encompass errors that are not always strictly grammatical in nature. A more descriptive term is Language Error
4. [4]:  Passage ID 4: Conclusions and Future ResearchGrammar checking is a major part of Natural Language Processing (NLP) whose applications ranges from proofreading to language learning. Much work has been done for the development of grammar checking tools in the past decade. However, fewer efforts are made for surveying the existing literature. Thus, we present a comprehensive study of English grammar checking techniques highlighting the capabilities and challenges associated with them. Also, we systematically selected, examined and reviewed 12 approaches of Grammar checking. The 12 approaches can be classified into three categories namely (1) Rule based technique, (2) Machine learning based technique, and (3) Hybrid technique. Each technique has its own advantages and limitations. Rule based techniques are best suited for language learning but rule designing is a laborious task. Machine learning alleviates this labor but it is dependent on the size and type of the corpus used. Hybrid technique
5. [5]:  Passage ID 5: using different schemes and approaches. For instance,correction of the syntax example involves transposing two adjacent wordsso we could introduce a fourth broad class and correction step oftransposition (word order). All extant annotation schemes break these broad classesdown into further subclasses based on the part-of-speech of the wordsinvolved, and perceived morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic orpragmatic source of the error. The schemes vary in the number of suchdistinctions, ranging from just over two dozen (NUCLE: (Dahlmeier, Ng, and Wu, 2013)) to almost a hundred(CLC: (Nicholls, 2003)). The schemes also identify different error spans in sourcesentences and thus suggest different sets of edit operations to obtainthe suggested corrections. For instance, the agreement error examplemight be annotated as She likes him and [kiss →→\rightarrow kisses]him at the token level or simply [ϵitalic-ϵ\epsilon →→\rightarrow es] at the character level.
