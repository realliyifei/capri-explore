## Answer

I don't know. The context provided does not include specific information about strategies explored to enhance the selection of in-context examples for mathematical reasoning tasks. While the passages discuss reasoning abilities, the challenges faced by language models, and some methods for evaluating reasoning performance, they do not specify particular strategies or approaches related to the selection of in-context examples for such tasks. Therefore, the context is insufficient to answer the question completely and precisely.

[1]: Passage ID 1: observations suggest that any evaluation of reasoning that does not take the pretraining data into account is difficult to interpret, and that we need to revisit evaluation of language models with respect to their pretraining data.2 Background and MethodologyReasoning ability has long been considered as a proxy for intelligence (Johnson-Laird, 2010). Thus, developing models with this skill has been also an essential goal of AI and natural language processing (NLP) (Bommasani et al., 2021).Recently, large language models have exhibited an ability to perform reasoning-related tasks in few-shot settings without requiring any modifications to their parameters through a method called in-context learning.Our goal is to evaluate this reasoning skill in-depth for numerical induction tasks.This section provides background information on in-context learning and introduces our method for measuring the performance gap of the models on numerical reasoning tasks based on differences in
[2]: Passage ID 2: to effectively elicit desired knowledge of models for specific tasks also presents significant challenges.To better understand users’ requirements for system design, we worked closely with four NLP and multimodal machine learning experts (E1-E4, E1 is the coauthor).E1 is a researcher with expertise in developing interactive systems for NLP and multimodal model analysis.E2 is a researcher with industry experience in applying and developing multimodal models for real-world applications.E3 and E4 are Ph.D. candidates with multiple top conference publications in the areas of multimodal machine learning and multimodal LLMs.All experts concurred that there is a lack of tools for systematically analyzing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The current practice usually starts with observing the model’s overall performance statistics (i.e., performance matrix) and then randomly sampling several instances to examine the reasoning correctness. While few datasets [38, 29]

[4]: Passage ID 4: is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, playing a critical role in problem-solving or decision-making by drawing inferences from premises, facts, and knowledge using logical principles and cognitive processes. There are various reasoning types, including deductive, inductive, abductive, quantitative, causal, and moral reasoning. Improving reasoning skills in NLP is vital for tasks such as question answering, reading comprehension, and dialogue systems, as it can enhance a model’s generalization ability in unseen scenarios. NLP research has evolved significantly, from early rule-based and symbolic approaches to statistical methods in the 1990s, which utilized probabilistic models and machine learning algorithms. In recent years, deep learning and neural networks have revolutionized the field, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, challenges remain in attaining human-like reasoning and generalization abilities, driving continued research for more
[5]: Passage ID 5: is structured as follows. We discuss related work on using LLMs to solve mathematical reasoning problems in Section 2. We describe our main method in Section 3. Our experimental setup including the task, model configuration, baselines and metrics are discussed in Section 4. We showcase our superior result also in Section 4.2 Related WorkImproving Mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs.Mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges for LLMs, and it is one of the key tasks for evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs. With a huge amount of math problems in pretraining datasets, the pretrained LLMs (OpenAI, 2023; Gemini Team et al., 2024; Touvron et al., 2023) are able to solve simple problems, yet struggle with more complicated reasoning. To overcome that, the chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022b; Fu et al., 2023) type prompting algorithms were proposed. These techniques were effective in improving the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks without modifying the model
