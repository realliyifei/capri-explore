The genus Brathinus.with one Japanese species and three in the United States and Canada, has been considered either as the basis for the monogeneric family Brathinidae (such as in Arnett, 1963), or as belonging to the Staphylinid subfamily Omaliinae (such as in Hatch, I957, and Crowson, 1967).Hammond (197I) has reviewed the question, has presented a series of eleven morphological characteristics of the Omaliinae possessed by Brathinus.and has concluded that Brathinus belongs in this subfamily.In addition, he provides a key to the species, illustrations of the male genitalia of the American species, and comments on the rarity of distribution and habitat data.The purpose of this paper is to provide additional habitat data and to contribute to an understanding of the distribution of the North American species.The data are drawn mostly rom my own records and collecting, and from material in the collections o the Caliornia Academy of Sciences, San Francisco (.C_AS), the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Ottawa (CNC), the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago (FMNH), the Illinois Natural History Survey, Urbana (INHS), the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University (MCZ), and the United States National Museum, Washington, D. C. (USNNI).In the following records, the locality and habitat data are given first, then, when available, the month of collection in lower case Roman numerals, the number of specimens, and the ab- breviation o the collections containing the material.Brathinus nitidus e,conte 1852The species ranges (map rom Newfoundland and Nova Sco.tia westwards to the Lake Superior Region, and south along the Appalachians to northern Alabama.It is associated with cool riparian and bog habitats, usually in shaded situations, in moss.or wet plant roots or under sto.nes, and especially in the spray zone of waterfalls.C. Lindroth (in Hammond, x97)  observed the beetles emerging *Manuscript recei,ed by the editor March 17, 1975 Enzyme Research

6o Psyche [March from earthworm-like holes in damp soil on the banks of a Newfoundland river.Most of the more southerly records of the species are from caves, where the beeries are probably seeking the cooler, more moist, and darker conditions.In caves, the beetles seem to be, able to survive quite well in the dark zone as well as in the twilight zone, but the association with caves is only a facultative (troglophilic) one, in spite of the cavernicolous characteristics of the beetles' thin cuticle and reduced pigmentation.Barr (968" 8) indicated that there was a cave-specialized (tro-  globitic) brathinid in lava tube caves in south'eastern Idaho, but this is the leiodid (sens.ulatu) Glacicavicola bathyscioides Westcott (968) which has converged to look remarkably like Brathinus (Peck, 97o, 973, 974).The omaliine characters cited by Ham- mond aid in separating Glacicavicola from this subfamily of staphy- linids.

Adults have been .collected in February and rom May through November, but are most often taken in the summer months.At least in the southern Appalachians and in caves the beetles may pass the winter as adults.

The genus had a continuous distribution from Asia through Berin- gia into and across North America in the Tertiary.The ancestral species nitidus-californicus may have been limited to North America, but ancestral varicornis-oculatus ranged from Asia across Beringia to eastern North America.With the progressive deterioration of cli- mates in the Pliocene, the Beringian distributional link of this second ancestral species was broken, and the Asian population evolved into oculatus, and the North American populations into varicornis.The western North American populations o varicornis were eliminated by fluctuating Pleistocene climates, and the species became restricted to eastern North America.The range o ancestral nitidus-californicus was ormerly across North America, but it became broken into two, in the mountains o eastern and western North America, during the fluctuating climatic events o the Pleistocene.Population separation and subsequent speciation into nitidus and californicus was acilitated by a dry-warm central continental climate in the Sangamon Interglacial or during an earlier interglacial.Later dispersal and expan- sion o ranges southwards was during the Wisco.nsinglacial.This is especially true for the expansion o nitidus south along the Appa- lachians.Both nitidus and varicornis have expanded northw.ardsinto formerly glaciated lands since deglaciation.Their southern limits may be contracting as warmer and drier interglacial conditions re- turn.B. nitidus, because of its preadaptation or cool and moist conditions, is now avoring caves in the southeast because they can serve as climatic re(ugia (Barr, 968 8o).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish to thank J. F. Lawrence (MCZ), J. Milton Campbell and Ales Smetana (CNC), Henry Dybas (FMNH), Milton W. San- derson (INHS), J. M. Kingsolver (USNM), and Hugh B. Leech and David H. Kavanaugh (CAS) for permitting the examination of material in the collections under their care.Walter R. Surer, Thomas C. Barr, Jr., J. Milton Campbell, Ales Smetana, and M. W. San- derson gave or corresponded on material or on their field experiences with Brathinus.Most of my personal data on Brathinus were ga.th- ered during field work supported by NSF grants GB 367 and GB 7346 to the Evolutionary Biology Committee, Harvard University, Professor Reed C. Rollins, principal investigator, and by Canadian National Research Council operating grants.The manuscript was read by J. M. Campbell, M. W. Sanderson, and J. F. Lawrence.

This is not an uncommon distribution disjunction. It is shown in many plant genera (Li, 952), is generalized as an Asian-American distribution type by Thorne (972), and, except for the presence o, B. californicus, is an example o the east Asian-eastern North American disjunct pattern o Darlington (957: 47), based on vertebrates. From my observations, and data provided by Hammond on B. oculatus Lewis o Japan, I suggest the ollowing distributional-evolutionary history.
