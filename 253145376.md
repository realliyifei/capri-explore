Schistosomiasis control in adults: a call for action towards the goal of universal health coverage Health status of people with intellectual disabilities: A systematic literature review

European Journal of Public Health
322022Abstract citation ID: ckac130.030 Gateways not gatekeepers -reaching seldom-heard groups to gather public health community insights Abstract citation ID: ckac130.032 iii324
Background:Each local authority in England must develop a Health and Wellbeing Strategy (HWS) in collaboration with NHS partners to plan and support delivery of local improvements in health and wellbeing. HWSs often draw on diverse sources but few are informed by consultative exercises involving citizens. South Tyneside Council in Northern England sought to ensure their new HWS was community-informed, specifically including seldom-heard groups and individuals. Specific objectives of this community insights research were to: 1.Target sampling and recruitment activities at typically marginalized, vulnerable or otherwise underrepresented groups 2.Explore the health and wellbeing-related views and priorities of these groups to address health inequalities Methods: A mapping exercise was undertaken to identify organisations who might act as gatekeepers to accessing participants from underrepresented groups. Focus groups were held in settingsbased venues where members would be comfortable and known to one another. Representatives of voluntary and community sector (VCS) organisations often helped to cofacilitate the discussions. Results: 119 participants took part in 16 group discussions. Three were held online, two were outdoors, while 11 involved community venues where the groups regularly met. We reached older and younger people, minority ethnic groups, and vulnerable men and women, including residents who had experienced homelessness, mental health issues, substance misuse, offending, domestic violence and learning disabilities. Participants were largely concerned with the wider determinants of health (such as poverty, employment, and leisure spaces), shifting the narrative away from individual lifestyle factors that tend to be the focus of much public health discourse.Conclusions:Gatekeepers from the VCS were essentially gateways, enabling us to include underrepresented voices in local consultation processes and generate new insights to inform the South Tyneside HWS.Key messages:Public health strategy development can address health inequalities through community-informed consultative exercises involving seldom heard members of vulnerable communities. Community consultations seeking to reach typically underrepresented groups require gatekeepers acting as gateways, and meeting participants where they are comfortably located at community venues.Abstract citation ID: ckac130.031

## Background:

Schistosomiasis is a high-burden parasitic disease and endemic in tropical climates, such as Madagascar. Recently it is emerging in Europe. Chronic infections lead to disabilities including loss in work productivity. Current control strategies focus on school-aged children, thereby systematically excluding adults. The goal to eliminate the disease as a public health problem is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals agenda, including Universal Health Coverage (UHC). We aim at assessing the distribution of schistosomiasis among adults in Madagascar, in order to promote more targeted public health initiatives against the disease.


## Methods:

In a cross-sectional study, 1477 blood samples were collected at three primary health-care centers in Madagascar from 03.21 to 01.22. A semi quantitative PCR assay was used to assess the presence of Schistosoma. Positivity rates with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were reported by gender and age groups.

## Results


## Conclusions:

Our preliminary results provide evidence of high positivity rates of schistosomiasis among adults in a highly endemic country. Differently from many studies, males seem more affected than females. The youngest age group, representing the more active workforce of a population, shows a higher positivity rate. Our data suggests that, in the logic of UHC and health as a human right, public health strategies for schistosomiasis need to be re-addressed towards a universal coverage of affected individuals. Key messages:

Inequalities in current control strategies to fight the tropical disease schistosomiasis might hinder the achievement of disease elimination and universal health coverage goals. Further systematically assessment and re-addressing of public health strategies towards universal coverage of affected individuals might help to close gaps in health care and reach the set goals.


: Our study population had a balanced gender distribution with 54.2% [CI: 51.7;56.8] of females and a median age of 37 years (IQR: 24-48). Preliminary results show an overall Schistosome positivity rate of 59.5% [CI: 57.0;62.0]. Positivity was higher in males 62.4% [CI: 58.7;66.1], than in females 57.1% [CI: 53.5;60.5]. Highest positivity was seen in the 18-34 year age group with 66.2% [CI: 62.7;69.6]. Lowest positivity of 46.2% [CI: 39.2;53.2] was observed in adults aged over 55 years.
