Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast is a rare malignant tumor which, with the features of Merkel cells is even rarer. Herein, we report a case of small cell carcinoma with Merkel cell features in a 52-year-old female. Microscopically, the tumor was characterized by diffuse and consistent small round cells that were de-adherent. The tumor cells had round or oval nuclei with delicate chromatin and small nucleoli, the cytoplasm was sparse and eosinophilic. Additionally, the tumor was accompanied by high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. Immunohistochemical staining showed that infiltrating tumor cells were positive for neuroendocrine markers, and punctately positive for CK20. The patient underwent modified radical mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. No recurrence or metastasis was observed during follow-up period. Primary breast small cell carcinoma with Merkel cell features is rare and easily misdiagnosed as Merkel cell carcinoma. Early diagnosis and treatment may improve patient prognosis.A 52-year-old female presented with a right breast mass that was inadvertently noticed two months prior.

## INTRODUCTION

Breast neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a primary malignancy. In 1977, Cubilla and Woodruff [1] described eight cases of breast NEC with morphological features similar to those of gastrointestinal and pulmonary NEC and positive staining for neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin A, synaptophysin, or neuron-specific enolase). To date, small cell carcinoma (SCC) with Merkel cell features is very rare, with limited cases showing morphological features and immunophenotypes similar to Merkel cell carcinoma [2][3][4]. Here, a case of breast SCC with Merkel cell features is described, in order to improve the diagnosis and treatment of such tumors.

outer quadrant of the right breast, 3.0 cm × 2.5 cm in size, with poor mobility, tenderness, and lymphadenopathy. There was no redness, swelling, or ulceration of the skin surface, and no discharge or bleeding from the nipple. Breast ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with calcification (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System grade 4c). Mammography revealed a 3.5 cm × 2.8 cm mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, with a uniform central density and obscured borders, like a shallow lobulation (Figure 1). The patient underwent intraoperative frozen pathology, was diagnosed with malignancy, and subsequently underwent modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer and axillary lymph node dissection.

Resected samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were examined by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining. The gross pathological specimens showed the following features: 1) "Right breast mass": The mastectomy specimen contained an ill-defined, yellowish white mass measuring 3.5 cm × 3.3 cm × 3.0 cm, without envelope. The mass was located 2 cm subcutaneously, in the breast parenchyma. 2) "Modified radical mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection": A right breast specimen, sized 27.0 cm × 22.0 cm × 9.0 cm, covered with shuttle-shaped skin. The area measured 21.0 cm × 7.0 cm, with a nipple diameter of 1.5 cm, and a surgical incision of 5.0 cm in length visible in the upper quadrant 4.0 cm away from the nipple. The volume of axillary adipose tissue was 10.0 cm × 6.5 cm × 5.0 cm, inside which 10 palpable swollen nodules were detected. Microscopically, the tumor was a poorly differentiated carcinoma with geographic necrosis, composed of diffuse and consistent small round cells (noncohesive cells) with diffuse sheet, nest, and cord-like infiltrative growth; with high nuclear grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) components surrounding the tumor. The nucleusto-cytoplasm ratio of the tumor cells was high and cytological atypia was moderate. Mitotic activity of these cells was 15 per 10 high-power fields. This finding is very similar to that of Merkel cell carcinoma (Figure 2A-D). No carcinoma residue was found in the modified radical resection specimens and no metastasis was found in the lymph nodes (0/10). Immunohistochemical staining results showed that the infiltrating carcinoma was diffusely positive for CD56, NSE, and Syn ( Figure 2E); and focally positive for CgA. Interestingly, CK20 was positively stained in a perinuclear dot-like pattern in most tumor cells, which is similar to the characteristics of Merkel cell carcinoma ( Figure 2F). However, the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 were all negative, and the Ki67 proliferation index was approximately 80%. The carcinoma cells were negative for CK7, CK5/6, GATA3, GCDFP-15, TTF1, CDX2, CD20, CD3, and mammaglobin. In the DCIS component, ER and PR were positive; HER2 was equivocal (2+); and CgA, Syn, CD56, and other neuroendocrine markers were negative.

These histological phenotypes are not typical features of NEC or invasive breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. In contrast, they are very common in Merkel cell carcinoma. Clinically, the mass was not located on the breast skin, and no mass outside of the breast was identified; therefore, it was more appropriate to diagnose it as a primary, poorly differentiated NEC of the breast with Merkel cell features. Based on the AJCC staging for breast cancer (8 th Edition), the stage of this tumor was IIA (pT2N0M0).

Postoperatively, the patient regularly (every three weeks) received six cycles of epirubicin combined with docetaxel chemotherapy, without experiencing chemotherapy-related side effects and symptoms. The patient was followed up for 20 months after surgery, and no recurrence or metastasis was found during this period.


## DISCUSSION

Breast NEC is a rare subtype that accounts for < 0.1% of breast cancer cases and occurs in menopausal patients aged 60-70 years, without distinct clinical features. Compared with non-specialized invasive breast cancer, patients often present with larger tumors with or without axillary lymph node metastasis [5].  and NEC (large cell and small cell types) [6]. The most common breast NEN is NET (welldifferentiated), whereas poorly differentiated SCC is the least common type.

Breast NEC with Merkel cell features is a rare subtype with limited reports in the literature ( Table 1). SCC with Merkel cell features was first proposed in a 1989 review of 51 cases of breast NEC, totaling two cases [4]. Among patients with lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis, a 41-year-old patient died 15 months after mastectomy due to lung metastasis, and a 50-year-old patient died 9 months after mastectomy due to brain and liver metastases and local skin recurrence [4]. In 1998, a 38-year-old female patient was diagnosed with breast NEC with Merkel cell features, and metastasis was present in one of seven axillary lymph nodes. The patient was alive without indications of recurrent disease six years after mastectomy [2]. In 2018, in an 86-year-old female patient, CT imaging five weeks postoperatively revealed multiple organ metastases, including liver, left adrenal nodules, right intramammary, and left axillary lymph node metastases. This patient opted for hospice care and died five weeks postoperatively, which is the fourth such case [3]. Currently, this subtype is considered as aggressive as SCC of the lungs.

Histologically, SCCs with Merkel cell features are microscopically similar to Merkel cell carcinoma [2]. The histological features of this case were consistent with those described in the aforementioned literature: diffuse and consistent small round cells with loose tumor stroma, delicate chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, scarce and eosinophilic cytoplasm, and visible local lymphatic infiltration. Histological morphology alone is not adequate for tumor diagnosis, and immunohistochemical staining is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. CgA, CgB, and synaptophysin are the most sensitive and specific neuroendocrine markers; other markers include NSE, CD56, and neurofilament triad proteins, but show low specificity [7]. Primary breast NEC is usually positive for CK7 and negative for CK20. However, previously reported cases of SCC with Merkel cell features were positive for CK20 and negative for CK7. The histological morphology and immunophenotype in this case were consistent with those reported previously. The positivity rate of hormone receptors is variable in all breast NEC and ranges from 54% to 90% [8,9]. Two previously reported cases of NEC with Merkel cell features were both negative for ER and PR [2,3]. The immunophenotypes of DCIS coexisting with breast SCC are varied. Ersahin et al. [10] reported one case of breast SCC that coexisted with DCIS, in which the invasive carcinoma was positive for TTF-1 and neuroendocrine markers (CD56, Syn, CgA), but the DCIS component was negative for both. In 2019, the WHO breast tumor classification and literature proposed that NEC accompanied by DCIS components and lacking extramammary masses could be diagnosed as primary NEC of the breast [5,11]. Additionally, imaging examinations exclude extramammary masses, and reveal axillary lymph node metastases, which can be diagnosed as primary breast NEC [12]. In the present case, no extramammary masses were found, and they were accompanied by a carcinoma-in-situ component; therefore, we diagnosed the patient with primary breast SCC with Merkel cell features.

Compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, there is no standard treatment option for breast NEC. Some studies have reported that breast NEC treatment could be based on invasive ductal cancer therapy, where surgical treatment is the first choice [5], followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy. However, adjuvant therapeutic strategies depend on the tumor size, stage, Nottingham classification, proportion of positive expression of estrogen and PRs [13], and long-term follow-up after surgery. Of the four previously reported patients with breast NEC with Merkel cell features, three underwent radical mastectomy [2,4], while the fourth patient was older and underwent right partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, and no adjuvant therapy was recommended [3]. The patient in this case report underwent a modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. During the 20-month follow-up period, the patient had no recurrence or metastasis, and the prognosis improved. Based on the current limited number of cases, the prognosis of the present tumor cannot be predicted.

As primary breast SCC with Merkel cell features is very rare, it is easily misdiagnosed as primary breast Merkel cell carcinoma or other similar morphological features. This can be avoided by mastering the diagnostic criteria and supplementing them with immunohistochemical staining. Early diagnosis and treatment may improve the prognosis of these patients, and long-term follow-up is essential. The optimal treatment strategy for this aggressive tumor needs to determined and is a subject for future clinical research.
