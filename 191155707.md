Sensors and Actuators: B. Chemical
RSC Adv2882019. 201910.1039/c9ra90040cThis correction is being published to alert readers that Fig. 9, 19 and 21 have been reproduced from a Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical article, which has now been retracted. The article was cited as ref. 16 in this RSC Advances paper. The retraction notice of the Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical article, 1 states that "this article reports a TEM image of the MAA capped CdS QDs (Fig. 2) which shows clear signs of manipulation (copy-pasting of the particles)". Fig. 2 of the Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical article was reproduced in this RSC Advances article as Fig. 9. The Royal Society of Chemistry apologises for these errors and any consequent inconvenience to authors and readers. Cite this: RSC Adv., 2019, 9, 16565 www.rsc.org/advances This journal is
