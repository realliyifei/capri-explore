Introduction We will launch a national survey in Serbia to document the prevalence of two types of questionable health behaviours: (1) intentional nonadherence to medical recommendations and (2) use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine practices, as well as the relation between the two.We will also investigate their psychological roots, including (a) 'distal' predictors such as HEXACO personality traits (plus Disintegration) and thinking dispositions (rational/ experiential thinking and cognitive reflexivity), and (b) 'proximal' predictors under the umbrella 'irrational mindset' (set of unfounded beliefs consisting of conspiratorial thinking, superstition, magical health beliefs as well as selected cognitive biases), which have more content-wise overlap with the health behaviours.Methods and analysis In this cross-sectional study, a research agency will collect data from a nationally representative sample (n=1043; age 18-75 years; estimated start/end-June/November 2023) recruited online (approximately, 70% of the sample, aged 18-54; 11 years) and face-to-face (approximately, 30% of the sample, aged 55-75 years).Participants will complete a battery of tests assessing questionable health behaviours, basic personality traits, thinking dispositions, irrational mindset, sociopolitical beliefs, sociodemographic and health-related variables.Prevalence rates will be calculated using descriptive statistics.To explore the relation between (psychological) predictors and questionable health behaviours, we will use hierarchical regression and partial mediation models (path analysis or full SEM models).Ethics and dissemination Ethical Committees of the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade (#935/1), Faculty of Special Education and Rehabilitation (#139/1) and Faculty of Media and Communications (#228) approved the protocol.Only participants who provide informed consent will participate in the study.A research report based on the study results will be submitted to peerreviewed journals and results will be made available to stakeholders through reports on the project website https://reasonforhealth.f.bg.ac.rs/en/ and disseminated via social media.Trial registration number NCT05808660

## INTRODUCTION

To maintain or improve health, people engage in a number of health practices.Some of those are evidence-based and recommended by experts, while others lack support for their effectiveness and may even pose a health risk, thus often labelled 'questionable health behaviours' (by using this term, our intention is not to judge or stigmatise people who adhere to non-evidence-based health practices, but to capture their psychological roots in order to understand them better).

People can deliberately decide not to follow medical recommendations, for example, they can self-medicate, change the dosage or duration of medicine-taking or skip regular check-ups.In previous research, we developed a novel instrument to measure these intentional non-adherence (iNAR) behaviours and gathered empirical evidence that they capture a single underlying tendency. 1Nonadherence can have severe consequences, such as increased mortality rates, 2 the spread of infectious diseases 3 and increased economic burden on healthcare systems. 4raditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM) encompasses a broad


## STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY

⇒ The representative sample enables assessment of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM) and intentional non-adherence to medical recommendations (iNAR) prevalence in the general population in Serbia.⇒ Previous lines of research enabled formulations of precise hypotheses on TCAM and iNAR behaviours and their correlates.⇒ The comprehensive assessment of irrational mindset at the level of perception, cognition and beliefs.⇒ Assessment of TCAM and iNAR retrospective behaviour, rather than attitudes.⇒ Behaviour will be assessed through retrospective self-report only, not using a multimethod approach.

Open access set of practices, most often not integrated into the official medical system. 5Use of TCAM practices is associated with several risks, such as adverse events, 6 avoidance or neglect of official treatment 7 8 and interaction with official treatment, for example, see references. 9 10Despite their growing use, TCAM practices remain insufficiently assessed, with existing evidence showing little to no support for their effectiveness. 6he current study will measure the prevalence and structure of these two types of questionable health behaviours on a nationally representative sample, and explore their predictors which we group into sociodemographic and health-related, distal psychological and proximal psychological.While the relations between sociodemographic variables and health behaviours have been extensively studied, for example, see references, 11 12 there is accumulated data suggesting that psychological variables might be of greater importance, especially for TCAM and iNAR 1 13 14 We will examine the relations between basic personality traits and thinking dispositions on the one hand, and questionable health behaviours on the other.We will treat the former as distal predictors as they encompass basic individual differences and do not overlap content-wise with the behavioural outcomes.The basic personality traits are defined via the HEXACO model 15 16 complemented with Disintegration-a recent reconceptualisation of the proneness to psychotic-like experiences as a general dispositional tendency, 17 a basic personality trait separate from Big five 18 and HEXACO traits. 19It was found that Disintegration predicts both TCAM related to COVID-19 pandemic and non-adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. 20Additionally, non-adherence to COVID-19 guidelines was predicted by low Honesty, apart from Disintegration.These findings were mostly replicated in a recent study of both types of health-related behaviours not specifically related to the pandemic. 14Thinking styles capture individual differences in the tendency to rely on reason, process information analytically or to rely on intuition and process information more synthetically, and this is often operationalised as rational/experiential cognitive processing 21 and actively open-minded thinking. 22 235][26][27] While there are no studies relating them to iNAR, scarce evidence suggests that an experiential thinking style is related to more negative attitudes towards evidence-based practices. 25ognitive reflection, the ability to inhibit or over-ride intuitive and often incorrect answers by engaging into a more deliberative thinking process, 28 was also found to be related to more frequent TCAM use, 29 while results of its relation with non-adherence behaviours are mixed. 30 31nother group of psychological predictors encompasses a set of variables that we named Irrational mindset, defined as thinking and beliefs that do not follow standards of normative logic, that lack an evidence base and persist even when confronted with disconfirming evidence.These variables are considered 'proximal' predictors in our design since they overlap in content with questionable health behaviours.Previous studies demonstrated that TCAM use and beliefs are predicted by constructs belonging to the irrational mindset, such as superstition, 13 32 conspiracy mentality, 33 34 medical conspiracies, 13 35 magical beliefs about health, 13 36 endorsement of contradictory beliefs (ie, doublethink 37 ), as well as several cognitive biases, such as susceptibility to naturalness bias, 13 38 illusory correlations 13 and belief bias. 14Although the results are less robust, some studies suggest that certain aspects of an irrational mindset relate to medical non-adherence, such as conspiracy beliefs, 35 personal, irrational beliefs 14 and overconfidence bias. 31 39n important set of constructs-sociopolitical beliefswere also found to be related to questionable health behaviours.Following recommended health behaviours was positively predicted by trust in science, while pseudoscientific beliefs predicted non-adherence. 38In addition, reports suggest that uncritical scientific reporting about TCAM, and uncritical trust in science and scientists add to widespread TCAM use and beliefs in its effectiveness 40 41 for the analysis of Serbian media landscape, see reference. 42Finally, although findings are scarce, some evidence suggests that a more conservative political orientation predicts non-adherence (eg, references 43 44 and use of TCAM). 45Religiosity and spirituality were also found to be related to TCAM use [46][47][48] as well as non-adherence. 49part from being predictors of questionable health behaviours, irrational mindset variables have frequently been found to be mutually related, 35 50-52 prompting a question on whether they have a shared common basis.Some authors state that the root of all irrational beliefs lies in illusory pattern perception, that is, the automatic tendency to make sense of the world by identifying meaningful relations between unrelated stimuli. 53Illusory pattern perception is a central mechanism that accounts for belief in conspiracy theories and supernatural beliefs, 52 and, on the other hand, has been directly linked to the neural mechanisms generating individual differences in disintegrative tendencies. 18Therefore, one of our major expectations-drawn from the previous findings 20 54 -is that the relation between Disintegration and TCAM will be partially mediated by illusory pattern perception and related irrational beliefs and cognitions.As for basic thinking dispositions, a lack of cognitive reflection was also found to be predictive of various manifestations of an irrational mindset, 55 56 leading us to expect that a similar partial mediation effect will be observed in the case of cognitive reflection-TCAM relation.Objectives 1.To investigate the prevalence of TCAM and iNAR use in the general population in Serbia, as well as their mutual relations.2. To examine the distribution of irrational mindset variables in the general population.

Open access 3. To explore the relations between TCAM and iNAR behaviours on the one hand and variables of personality, thinking styles and cognitive reflection (distal psychological predictors) on the other.4. To explore the relations between TCAM and iNAR behaviours on the one hand and irrational mindset and sociopolitical beliefs (proximal psychological predictors) on the other.5. To investigate whether the relations between TCAM and iNAR and distal predictors will be mediated by irrational mindset and socio-political attitudes and beliefs.

Hypotheses 1.We expect that a minimum of 90% of the general population will have used at least some TCAM practices and engaged in at least some iNAR behaviours at some point in their lifetime.2. The correlation between TCAM and iNAR in the general population will be positive, small to medium in magnitude.3.Among the three blocks of predictors-(1) sociodemographics and health-related variables such as health status, chronic diseases, BMI, etc, (2) distal psychological, that is, personality, thinking styles and cognitive reflection and (3) proximal psychological, that is, the irrational mindset, as well as sociopolitical beliefs-we expect that psychological predictors (both distal and proximal) will explain considerably more variance in both TCAM and iNAR behaviours than sociodemographic and health-related variables, that is, will have contributions incremental to sociodemographic and health-related variables in predicting both behaviours.Furthermore, in a hierarchical linear model predicting TCAM, we expect that proximal psychological predictors will contribute incrementally over sociodemographics and health-related and distal predictors, while in the case of iNAR, it is expected that distal psychological predictors will contribute incrementally over sociodemographics and health-related variables and proximal psychological predictors.4. We expect that a portion of the variance in TCAM explained by distal psychological predictors will be mediated via proximal psychological predictors.We expect that the positive effects of Disintegration and negative effects of cognitive reflection test (CRT) will be mediated through the following variables capturing the irrational mindset (which will all positively predict TCAM): apophenia, conspiracies, superstitions and magical health beliefs.Specifically, eight simple partial mediation effects will be tested based on SEM and/ or path/regression models: Disintegration, apophenia, TCAM; Disintegration, conspiracies (both general and specific conspiracies, see in the Instruments and variables section) TCAM; Disintegration, superstitions, TCAM; Disintegration, magical health beliefs, TCAM.We expect the same mediation pattern with CRT as the main predictor, however with the opposite direction of effects on the irrational mindset (another four partial mediation effects, making eight altogether).We will also test more complex mediation models with other variables, but they will be treated as exploratory.


## METHODS


## Sample

A sample of n=1043 enables detecting the correlation of 0.10 with the power of 0.90 (with two-sided alpha level set at 0.05).Moreover, this sample size is adequate for assessing structural equation models (including confirmatory factor analysis) for which a sample size of n>200-500 is typically recommended. 57 58It should enable us to detect even small indirect (mediated) effects in the path analyses of simple partial mediation models, but is also adequate for an SEM analysis of these models if factor loadings are large enough and the number of latent factor indicators ≥3, according to the simulation analysis recently reported by reference. 59he sample will be a probabilistic household one, representative for the general population in Serbia, with participant age range between 18 and 75 years.Approximately, 70% of the sample will be recruited online (18-54;11 years), and 30% face-to-face (55-75 years).The online subsample will be a one-staged stratified quota sample.The primary sampling unit will be the respondent, a member of an online panel database aged 18-50 years who fulfils the criteria based on population quotas.The face-to-face subsample will be a three-stage random representative stratified sample with the statistical circle area as the primary sampling unit, household as the secondary sampling unit and the respondent as the tertiary sampling unit.Areas will be selected with probability proportional to size, households will be selected based on simple random sampling without replacement (random choice of the starting point and equal steps of choice) and the respondents will be selected randomly from listed members of the household aged 55-75 years.

The inclusion criterion is age.Exclusion criteria are as follows: (a) the inability to understand the Serbian language, (b) failure to pass any of the four attentioncheck questions.

To evaluate whether the sample is indeed representative, we will compare population quotas on gender, age, regional distribution and education from the latest Serbian census data, provided by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (https://www.stat.gov.rs/en-US/), with those observed in the sample.


## Procedure

Online and door-to-door data collection with the assessment tools will be conducted via a research agency.Data will be collected online and face-to-face via Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI), using a standardised case report form.Face-to-face data collection will be performed by trained interviewers specialised in largesample survey data collection.Participants will provide Open access a written informed consent.If a respondent is visually impaired or has difficulties reading, the interviewer will read the items and record the responses.Missing data are not expected, because the questionnaire will have a forced response format.Four attention-check items will be dispersed among other items in the questionnaire to exclude participants who fail to provide correct responses to any of them (as recommended for this type of studies, eg), [60][61][62] thus increasing the quality of collected data without compromising their validity. 63


## Instruments and variables

To assess health behaviours-that is, TCAM and iNARwe will use two instruments: iNAR-12, 1 a 12-item selfreport instrument assessing intentional non-adherence to official medical recommendations and TCAM-22, 13 a self-report instrument assessing use of TCAM overall and across four domains (alternative medical systems, natural product-based practices, new age practices and rituals/ customs).For both inventories, participants report whether they have engaged in the health behaviours on a binary scale (0-no, 1 -yes).Additionally, we will explore how participants typically use practices from the four TCAM domains (preventive/alternative/complementary use).

The block of sociodemographic and health-related variables will include participants' sex, age, education, place of residence (urban/rural), marital status, number of children/grandchildren, average monthly household income, household size, body mass index (BMI, based on self-reported weight and height), smoking, self-reported health status (on a 1-5 scale) and chronic illness (by indicating responses on a checklist of chronic conditions, eg, cardiovascular gastrointestinal).

The block of distal predictors will include basic personality traits from the HEXACO-60 inventory; 64 Serbian version 65 in assessing the six basic traits (Honesty/ Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness), with 10 items each.Disintegration will be assessed using a 20-item version of the DELTA scale, 19 capturing nine subdimensions of proneness to psychotic-like experiences and behaviours.Thinking styles will be assessed with a short, 8-item version 66 of The Rational-Experiential Inventory. 67The rational and experiential scale consist of four items each.We will also administer the 8-item Actively Open-Minded Thinking Scale assessing the tendency to use evidence to revise beliefs.Cognitive reflection will be assessed by using a short CRT proposed by Frederick, 28 consisting of three items that cue an intuitive but incorrect response.

The variables within the set of proximal predictors can be tentatively classified into those capturing the irrational mindset and those assessing sociopolitical attitudes and beliefs.Within the irrational mindset, we will assess Apophenia with the Snowy Pictures Task. 68The task consists of 24 stimuli, each containing a grainy image, with half of the stimuli containing an embedded picture that can be perceived and that will be used as distractors, while the other half will not not contain any pattern and are the target stimuli.Belief in conspiracy theories will be measured using two scales: the general Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ 69 ; Serbian version 50 in five items), and a more specific measure of Belief in medical conspiracy theories (adapted from references, 35 50 70 five items).We will assess magical health beliefs with 10 items from the general magical beliefs factor of the Magical Beliefs about Food and Health Scale. 71To measure superstition, we will use 10 items from the Superstition scale 72 with the highest loadings on the general factor.We will use six items with the highest loadings from the Extra-sensory perception belief scale. 73Doublethink will be measured via the Proneness to doublethink scale, 51 consisting of 11 pairs of contradictory beliefs, the score of which is calculated by counting the number of contradictory pairs where participants indicated both statements in the pair to be true (mark 3 or 4 on a 4-point scale).Personal irrational beliefs will be assessed via the short six-item General Attitude and Belief Scale (GABS). 74Overconfidence bias will be expressed as a difference between the CRT confidence score calculated as the mean percentage of confidence judgement across three items and the accuracy score on the same test calculated as the percentage of correct answers.We will use a single item to assess illusory correlation, 75 where participants will be presented with data showing no correlation between two variables, 76 and asked to describe the data.Responses indicating a positive correlation between the two variables will be treated as evidence of an illusory correlation.Naturalness bias will be measured as a hypothetical preference for a natural drug over a synthetic drug, all other things being equal. 77Omission bias will be assessed by a scenario where refusing a medication is associated with a higher risk of an adverse outcome than accepting the medication. 78Belief bias 79 will be measured using four syllogistic reasoning problems that conflict the empirical and the logical status of the conclusion; the total score is expressed as a proportion of answers indicating that participants based their judgements about the conclusion's validity on the conclusion's believability. 80ommitment bias 81 will be measured as an expressed preference to continue advocating the health benefits of one food product over another despite the information on new evidence showing no difference between them.

Within the subset of sociopolitical beliefs, we will measure trust in the healthcare system and professionals, using gender-neutral items from the Women's trust and confidence in healthcare system-WITCH scale. 82Two items with the highest loadings from the Particularised (interpersonal) trust dimension will be used to assess trust in health professionals and two items with the highest loadings from the Generalised (mis)trust dimension to assess trust in the healthcare system.We will also measure Negative experiences with the healthcare system using five items with high loadings from the experiences with the medical system scale. 83Trust in science will be assessed with two items (α=0.76).To assess Scientism, we will use three items with the highest loadings from the Uncritical trust Open access in science and three items from the Uncritical trust in scientists scales of the Scientific Beliefs Questionnaire which uses a Thurston-type scale.We will administer the six item Digital Literacy Scale (as adapted in reference) 51 to assess how people search for information online and evaluate it.We will additionally include one multiple-choice item to measure which sources people use to obtain information about health.We will assess religiosity, spirituality and political orientation with a single item each.


## Data analysis plan

Descriptive statistics and correlations of all measured variables will be provided.The prevalence of TCAM and iNAR behaviours will be calculated as the proportion of persons in the sample engaging in these behaviours.Next, we will verify the proposed factor structure of TCAM and iNAR questionnaires through confirmatory factor models.Since TCAM-22 assesses both overall use of TCAM and use within the four TCAM domains, we will test the onefactor, the four-factor and the hierarchical model, while for iNAR-12 we will only test the one-factor model.Finally, we will test several partial mediation models in which distal predictors' effect on TCAM use is mediated by proximal, irrational mindset predictors.These models will be tested as path/regression models and, if adequate measurement models can be established, through SEM.Specifically, we will test eight models, four with Disintegration as the predictor and four with CRT as the predictor of TCAM, using apophenia, belief in co theories, superstition and magical beliefs about health as mediators.More complex models may be tested, depending on observed correlations between variables.We will also explore the relations between predictor variables in further exploratory analyses.

## DISCUSSION

Recent years have witnessed a rise of health behaviours such as TCAM and iNA 84 85 that interfere with evidencebased medical treatment and may lead to adverse health consequences. 2 3 6 7 10Little is known about the personrelated, and especially psychological processes that underlie these types of health behaviours and whether certain psychological dispositions such as personality and thinking styles via irrational beliefs act as barriers to rational health behaviours which follow evidence-based medical recommendations.As they lead individuals astray from effective treatment, understanding the prevalence and psychological precursors of these behaviours is of high relevance for improving public health.This study will examine the prevalence of questionable health behaviours (TCAM and iNAR), their mutual relations, the comparative importance of three sets of individual characteristics: sociodemographics, irrational beliefs and personality traits and thinking styles for these two healthrelated behaviours, as well as mediatory role of the the irrational mindset and socio-political beliefs in the relations between personality and TCAM and iNAR.

A recent pilot study 1 has shown that trust in the healthcare system in Serbia is related to iNAR behaviours.As it is currently unknown how dire iNAR behaviours are on a national level, the data collected on a nationally representative sample might help signal a call for action.The WHO's Traditional Medicine Strategy (2014-2023) calls out its member states for data collection, greater regulation, research and policy adoption regarding TCAM.As per the data from the Serbian Ministry of Health in 2012, registered alternative providers include acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, chiropractic, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, quantum medicine, reiki/ shiatsu, apitherapy and yoga (WHO, 2019).It is unknown to what extent registered alternative practices are used and what other alternative practices are used in Serbia.This study will contribute to national efforts in better understanding TCAM use and behaviour in Serbia.

As people differ in their vulnerability to these health behaviours, policies would need to be personalised. 86The insights into the person-level factors related to TCAM and iNAR behaviours can help shape communication strategies (eg, providing accessible information on evidence, or consequences) for individual consumers.The findings from the current study will inform planned experimental studies on how to address questionable health behaviours tailored to sociodemographics, specific personality traits and thinking styles and irrational beliefs.

In conclusion, evidence regarding the prevalence and types of TCAM and iNAR behaviours is currently lacking.While this study will be conducted in Serbia, questionable Open access health behaviours are a global problem and the methodology and results can highlight areas that can be researched further and cross-culturally.This study will provide the best estimate to date of the personal psychological factors that may underlie such behaviours and pave the way for future interventions.
