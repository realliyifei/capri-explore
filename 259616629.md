International scholars have recently demonstrated significant interest in fractional order filters (FOF) due to their greater design freedom and continuously stepped stopband attenuation rate. This paper presents a literature review on designing a fractional order filter based on the metaheuristic approach, which provides an optimum design technique and less passband and stopband error. The nonlinear, non-uniform, multidimensional, and multimodal FOF design issue error landscape is heavily exploited by the metaheuristic global search method. The algorithm's optimal coefficient values, which closely approximate the magnitude response of the ideal FOF, are reached at the completion of its repeated search routine.

## Introduction

Calculus in the fractional domain [1] recently had a widespread application in several engineering areas. The developments in fractional calculus applications were slow mainly due to the absence of a universally accepted geometrical and physical interpretation; this result in the whole field is limited to just a theory [2]. However, there has been considerable interest in the topic in recent years. Researchers have found that fractional-order models can represent systems better than integer-order ones despite the need for a universally accepted interpretation. The field has seen a steep rise in publications and has grown, but it is still far from conceptual completion, particularly in the theories, applications, and implementation methods [3].

Fractional calculus is viewed as a generalization of integer order calculus. In other words, the integration and differentiation for the integer order are exceptional cases of the corresponding operations for the fractional order. Since the mid-twentieth century, this mathematical tool has been used to create better models for simple and complex physical systems. Integer order (Newtonian) differential operators are Open Access Fayoum University Faculty of Engineering, 2023, Vol: 6 (2) local, while most fractional calculus operators are non-local except at integer points.

This allows the fractional order operator to capture the memory of the model and even extrapolate between past and future behaviour. This leaves Newtonian calculus as a special case and a subspace of fractional calculus. Fractional differentiation is often used to model phenomena exhibiting non-standard dynamical behaviors [4]. The formula (1) is considered a generalization case of differentiation as ∈ . The Laplace transform of the G-L fractional differ-integration with zero initial conditions is given by Eqn. (2).
∫ ( ) = ( ).(2)
The R-L definition of fractional calculus is a continuation of the -fold successive integration process. As per the R-L method, the fractional differentiation of a function ( ) is given by Eqn.

This paper deals with the analysis, design and applications of meta-heuristic algorithms in the design of fractional order filters and the implantation using fractance devices. A fractance device is an electrical component that has an impedance of ( ) = ⇒ ( ) = ∠( /2 


## Related Work

i-Basic concepts of FOF design:

Much research has been done using different approximations of filters into the fractional-order domain.

In [9] and [10], the author suggested designing filters using fractional order capacitors; when their value increases, these systems have a better magnitude response in the passband area. Freeborn designed FLPF in [11], and a higher-order prototype equation for the filter was designed using ii-Previous attempts on FOF design: 
= ∑ [| ( )| − | ( )|] , where | ( )|
the FO magnitude at frequency  , | ( )| is the first-order HP Butterworth magnitude at frequency , and is the total number of compared frequency points.

In [18], the author discussed a quick and easy method for obtaining a fractional order Chebyshev-like response based on the conventional integer order poles.

The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of fractional order transfer functions utilizing the poles of the well-known Chebyshev filter of integer order.

The main idea is to construct the transfer function's denominator as Eqn. (5a):
( ) = ∏ ( − ) (5a) ( ) = ( )(5b)
Where l = 2⌈ ⌉ and n is the integer order, p is the integer order poles, and is the fractional pole powers, Eqn (5b)

gives the final form of the transfer function.

In Addition, the author in [19] introduces inverse Chebyshev filters in the fractional domain. Inverse Fayoum University Faculty of Engineering, 2023, Vol: 6(2)

Chebyshev lowpass filters are generally realized using lowpass notch circuits of second order. Then this transfer function was extended to the fractional order domain.

The new transfer function had an order (1 + ), and its unknown coefficients were given using a curve fitting technique to optimize the response error between the integer transfer function and the fractional one.

This result in small-size circuit implantation due to increasing the degree of freedom in the design by introducing the parameter .

A straightforward approach to extend the Chebyshev filter into the fractional domain is done by converting the Chebyshev polynomial to the fractional domain Eqn. (6), this is achieved by converting the integer order N into fractional order , which results in ( ) polynomial [8].
( ) = cos ( ) | | ≤ 1 cosh ℎ ( ) | | > 1 ,(6)
Inserting the generated polynomials in the magnitude response equation Eqn. (7), result in Chebyshev LPF response, where is the peak ripple in the pass band area.
( ) = ( ) ,(7)
Using the same technique to generate a high pass filter is done by replacing → in the low pass filter magnitude response equation ( ). Figure 1 shows the Chebyshev LPF generated using the magnitude response equation based on polynomials Eqn. (6) in a different order. Whereas Fig. 2 shows the counterpart high pass filter. It is clear from Fig.1 that the step toward the fractional domain in filter design introduces more degree of freedom in the design parameters such that a more accurate gradient slope is realizable to be more precise with the applications.

The fractional order bandpass filter is achieved by cascading two sections, one for fractional low pass filter and the other for fractional high pass filter; Eqn describes this. (8). Figure 3 shows symmetric when = . When ≠ an asymmetric slope at band pass filter response is resulted at different orders for FLPF and FHPF.  It is worth noting that the techniques reported in [11], [15] and [18] employ a fractional order prototype equation to approximate the ideal FOLPF. Implementing such transfer functions can be done using fractance devices.
( ) = ( ) × ( ) .(8)
The fractional parameter can be viewed as a tuning key that adds flexibility to the system dynamics. Even though research is being done to physically implement the FOC [18] and [19], these fractance devices are not yet accessible on the market.

As a result, using the traditional/classical (integer-order) circuit parts to create the circuit is a more straightforward design technique when using the integer order approximations to realize the FOLPFs.

The techniques described in [11], [12] approximate the FOLPF with an integer order approximation; however, the design approach uses a suboptimal method like Oustaloup and continuing fraction expansion (CFE) [20]. This should be acknowledged as well.

In [20], the fractional-step filters are designed using a synthesis approximation technique (fraction expansion (CFE)). He showed that using a maximum absolute magnitude error (MAME) analysis Eqn. (9)  In the case of equally order exponents, the prototype function is given by equation Eqn. (12). Figure 5 shows the convergence curves using different prototype equations. The algorithm reaches constant value during the optimization process for all orders at each filter type. That means the number of iterations is enough to find optimal solutions [26].   

The method used in [27] approximates coefficients for various normalized FLPF transfer function situations.

However, this approach concentrated on several parameters, such as transition bandwidth and maximum permitted peak,

and was based on a limited search for objective functions.

In [28], the author shows that FOF can provide precise FOF can provide a further degree of freedom that can provide more precise control over the attenuation slope as compared to integer-order filters of order n. In another case in [30], a fractional transfer function is approximated using an integer order transfer function; this technique is useful to reduce the circuit components used in filter implementation.

For example, a 1.5th-order Butterworth filter can be realized using a single operational amplifier (op-amp), one FO capacitor, one conventional capacitor, and three resistors.

In contrast, four current feedback op-amps (CFOAs), three conventional capacitors, and eight resistors are needed to create a third-order approximation of the same filter with six decades of design bandwidth. A study case using a metaheuristic algorithm to approximate the magnitude response of the fractional Chebyshev filter was introduced in [29]. The implementation was achieved using voltage mode

Sallen-Key topology. The author used two fractional Chebyshev polynomials to verify the reliability of the methods. The FOE was approximated using Valsa's approximation and verified using LT-spice circuit simulation.

Eqn (10) gives the approximated transfer function used in [29]. Figures 6a and 6b   It is worth mentioning that in [33], the author applied a new idea called series optimization, symbolized by: First metaheuristic approach to Second meta-heuristic approach. The first population is generated from the first meta-heuristic approach and becomes an input for the second meta-heuristic approach to generate the optimal solution. This technique enabled him to benefit from the merits of two different metaheuristic algorithms named cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and interior search algorithm (ISA) to approximate integer order Butterworth low pass filter. Based on optimal coefficients of the prototype function ( ) =

.

The mechanism of series optimization is: turning the best solution from CSA to be the initial solution for ISA, this lead to more optimal and fast solutions.

In [34], the author used the genetic algorithm to perform a stochastic optimization search of the target space by artificially simulating the biological evolution process in nature [35] based on the prototype function that Eqn represents. (11). This transfer functs used for different values of n to approximate the magnitude response generated from Eqn. (7) based on polynomial represented by Eqn. (6).

The generated prototype function coefficients that approximate filter response is compared with other prototype functions generated from synthesis approximation methods or classical optimization methods based on the metrics described below:

Passband error (PE): The error observed in the passband (till 1 rad/s) when compared to the ideal magnitude response.
PE = 20 × log ∑ || . ( )| | ( )|| dB ,(13)
where K = 5000 and 0.01 ≤ ≤ 1.

Stopband error (SE): The error observed in the stopband (from 1 to 10 rad/s) when compared to the ideal magnitude response. (14) where K = 5000 and 1≤ ≤ 10.
SE = 20 × log ∑ || . ( )| | ( )|| dB ,

## Algorithm SE PE

Meta-heuristic -95 dB -80 dB classical optimization -36 dB -26 dB

The parameter K was chosen based on the generated line space in the MATLAB simulation, as K increase the precision increase, In short, if we increase the value of K more than this limit, there will be no noticeable change [36]. 

## The
Riemann-Liouville (R-L) definition and the Grunwald-Letnikov (G-L) definition are the two main definitions of differentiation and integration in the fractional domain(differ-integration)[5]. The G-L formula is a numerical differentiation formula extracted from the backward finite difference formula. As per the G-L method, the fractional order differentiation of a function ( ) is given by Eqn. and, Γ(⋅) denotes the gamma function.


the magnitude response can be shaped without altering the stopband region. By applying the CFE method there are equations relate These coefficients and the fractional order . Therefore, through careful selection of , the passband region can be shaped to closely resemble the passband of a Butterworth response while maintaining the desired fractional step through the stopband.The higher order transfer function equations, based on using the standard Butterworth polynomials, were given by

, s.t. N represents the number of frequency point distributions, the shortcoming of CFE approximation in comparison with optimization techniques as approximation error is dependent on the fractional order, so it becomes large for higher order; this result in the design cannot be achieved at the whole design required band of frequency. in [21] used curve fitting techniques to approximate FOLPF, such as the Sanathanan-Koerner (SK) least square iterative method, which approximates the integer order transfer function. However, they result in higher-order integer transfer function approximations and do not have optimal approximations.3. Metaheuristic Algorithms:Complex optimization problems, or those that can't be solved optimally using a deterministic approach in a reasonable amount of time, are well known for responding well to metaheuristic methods. The three main uses of metaheuristic approaches are to solve problems quickly, handle enormous issues, and create more reliable algorithms. These methods are flexible and simple to apply and design. In general, metaheuristic algorithms mimic natural events by combining rules and randomization[22].The evolution strategy, genetic algorithms (GA), and artificial immune (AI) are a few biological systems that modify metaheuristic algorithms. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), bee colony optimization (BCO), bacterial foraging optimization algorithms (BFOA), and ant colony optimization are examples of ethnological phenomena (ACO). Swarm algorithms, micro-canonical annealing, and threshold-accepting techniques are physics phenomena[23].

## Figure 4
4summarizes the categorization of the meta-heuristic algorithms; it shows that swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation are two categories for metaheuristics based on population. The behaviour of social insect colonies or animal societies serves as the model for the broader phrase "swarm intelligence" another example of Figure3: Symmetric Fractional Chebyshev bandpass filter Fayoum University Faculty of Engineering, 2023, Vol: 6(2) a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by musical phenomena is the harmony search (HS) algorithm. Single-solution-based and population-based metaheuristic algorithms can also be used to classify metaheuristic algorithms. The noising technique, TABU search, SA, and TA are a few examples of single-solution-based metaheuristics [24]. Most optimization algorithms have parameters involved that guide their direction towards the global best solution. These parameters have utmost importance since a deviation from a "reasonable" value can bring about divergence, so the convergence curve metric measures the value of the objective function versus the computation time during the minimization (model calibration) [25]. optimal. It is possible to define the objective function for such an optimization issue to minimize the difference between the ideal response and the response obtained from the proposed integer order prototype equation approximation. The suggested model's numerator and denominator polynomial coefficients serve as the optimization process's design variables. Be considerate that the denominator polynomial's existence causes the transfer function of the suggested filters to yield a very nonlinear cost function. This optimization problem has multiple dimensions since all of the coefficients of the integer order filter are used as the decision variables. Additionally, the nature of this specific optimization problem is multimodal; therefore, a global optimization search technique can guarantee a more accurate approximation compared to the CFE-based approach presented in[20] for constructing FOLPFs.The prototype function describes the model in the general form given by Eqn.(10) and is called a fully fractional transfer function. When = 1, the function, in this case, is called the fractional stepped transfer function is given by Eqn.(11). It is worth mentioning that the general method to construct the denominator of Eqn. (11) for any higher order step fractional prototype equation is ( )

and stopband attenuation. Integer-order filters yield -20n dB/decade stopband gradients, where n is the integer order. However, fractional order provides greater control with -20(n + α) dB/decade stopband attenuation, where α is any real positive value less than 1. The (n + α)


compare the original magnitude response based on second and third-order fractional Chebyshev polynomial to the optimal prototype function equation Eqn. (10). The error curve is bounded, and the maximum error is ℎ 0.5% at the stopband area and ℎ 0.2% at the transition area. The approximation is achieved using the magnitude response equation Eqn. (6) fractional Chebyshev polynomial results from solving the Chebyshev differential equation in the fractional domain [17].

This was achieved by using a multi-objective optimization technique to design a FOLPF. The circuit realization was done through second-generation current conveyor (CCII) based fractional low-Pass filter. The design procedure proposed in this work showed the extra degree of freedom the FO introduced by fractional calculus to filter design.

The study used SE Eqn.(13) and PE Eqn.(14) error as performance metrics in the case of Chebyshev FLPF at order = 1.7, K= 5000 is the number of frequency points and they are logarithmically spaced in the region ω ∈ [1, 10 4 ] × 2π rad/sec. The upper and lower bounds for the components of the coefficient's vector of the Table2: Comparison metrics at order =1.7 using different approximations technique[29],[36]. Fayoum University Faculty of Engineering, 2023, Vol: 6(2)transfer function Eq.(10) are 10 7 and 1, respectively, while the upper and lower bounds for the exponents are 1 and 0.7, respectively. This indicating how useful the use of metaheuristic approaches gives the best performance. The metaheuristic approach approximates the ideal magnitude response to a realizable fractional prototype function, which enables approximation all over the frequency band and decreases circuit complexity. Nature-inspired metaheuristic search techniques are useful for finding the optimal search variables (multidimensional optimization problems). The convergence speed of the metaheuristic algorithms toward the global (or nearly global) optimal results is better than traditional techniques. The robustness and the capability of this tool to solve multimodal systems have been verified throughout a study example that approximates the magnitude response to fully fractional prototype functions. The error at the stable output is bounded to be less than 2% within a few iterations, and the approximation is achieved over the whole frequency band. The literature indicates that the filter magnitude response approximation-based meta-heuristic algorithm needs to be better covered. Future work could establish by using a similar order transfer function. This approach is useful in interpolating fractional transfer function coefficients as a function of fractional order . Additionally, using a metaheuristic approach, Legendre and elliptic filter types are not approximated from their magnitude response equation. Further studies should investigate the methods to generate fractional polynomial modelling for this filter type. These filter types are widely used due to their phase characteristic, which is nearly linear in the pass region. This gives a maximally-flat group delay, which becomes a good choice for pulse circuits because ringing and overshoot are minimized and have poor attenuation slopes. Finally, the series optimization technique is useful and should be investigated in all metaheuristic algorithm types.
