We have performed a detailed spectral analysis of the helium-rich hot subdwarf EC 20187−4939 using data obtained in the SALT survey of helium-rich hot subdwarfs. We have measured its effective temperature, surface gravity and chemical abundances from the spectrum. Its radius has also been determined by fitting the spectral energy distribution using photometric data, from which a mass of 0.44 +0.32 −0.19 M has been inferred using the measurement of surface gravity. This star is particularly abundant in helium and nitrogen, whilst being both carbon and oxygen-weak. The surface abundances and mass have been found to be consistent with a helium white dwarf merger product. The abundance effects of alpha captures on nitrogen during the merger process and possible connections between EC 20187−4939 and other carbon-weak related objects are discussed.

# INTRODUCTION

Hot subdwarfs are evolved helium-burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes (Heber 1986;Heber 2016). Their surface chemical compositions are affected by the abundances of the progenitor star or stars, the formation pathway, and chemical mixing such as diffusion and radiative levitation. As the majority are formed from post-mainsequence stellar cores, hot subdwarfs offer insight into evolution processes which are usually hidden under the envelope. It is therefore valuable to stellar physics in general to understand their composition and formation. The majority of hot subdwarfs have very low-mass hydrogen-rich envelopes and helium-poor surfaces. Approximately 10% have helium-rich surfaces with hydrogen being less than 1% by number (Geier 2013). Of current interest is what differentiates the hydrogen-deficient from the hydrogen-rich subdwarfs, and whether their evolution pathways can be linked with those of other classes of star.

Multiple formation pathways for hot subdwarfs are suggested by theory. Binary interaction is thought to be extremely important, if not essential, in the formation process (Han et al. 2002(Han et al. , 2003. In this case, a post-main-sequence star may be stripped by its companion, or the hot subdwarf may be formed by the merging of two white dwarfs. There are also suggested formation pathways involving single stars, although in this case the mass loss mechanism needed to remove the envelope is uncertain (Brown et al. 2001). Hydrogen-rich surfaces of white dwarfs involved in a merger will be completely mixed with more abundant helium-rich material; thus merger products are more likely to be helium rich. Since helium is produced by the CNO-cycle, enhanced nitrogen abundances are expected and often seen (Ströer ★ E-mail: laura.scott@armagh.ac.uk et al. 2007). If one of the white dwarfs is sufficiently massive, carbon and possibly oxygen produced during the merger can also be advected to the surface of the product (Zhang & Jeffery 2012).

EC 20187−4939 is a hot subdwarf observed in the Edinburgh-Cape survey of faint blue stars (Stobie et al. 1997) and subsequently in the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) survey of chemicallypeculiar hot subdwarfs (Jeffery et al. 2021). It is bright enough to observe at high-resolution ( § 2) in order to explore connections between cooler extreme helium stars and hot helium-rich subdwarfs via their surface chemistry. For this paper, the spectroscopic data have been analysed to provide temperature, surface gravity and abundance measurements. Photometric data have also been considered and show an excess of flux in the infrared ( § 3). The results will be discussed with an emphasis on the abundances and the possible formation mechanism of EC 20187−4939 ( § 4).


# OBSERVATIONS

The principal spectroscopic data used in this analysis were obtained using SALT's High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) on 2016 May 25. Two exposures were made in each of the blue (3860-5519Å) and red (5686-8711Å) spectral regions. They were reduced to onedimensional object and sky orders (total counts versus wavelength) using the SALT pipeline (Crawford et al. 2016). The individual orders were rectified and merged onto a common wavelength grid, and the two observations were combined. The merged blue spectrum is shown in Fig. 1 with spectral lines labelled. The high noise level short-ward of 4100Å makes the blue end unusable. Apart from He , H +He and many telluric lines, no stellar absorption lines can be identified in the HRS red spectrum, hence only observations in the blue (3860-5519Å) region have been used in this work.

In addition, the medium-resolution spectrum of EC 20187−4939 described by Jeffery et al. (2021) was also used. This spectrum was obtained on 2018 May 17 with SALT's Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS).


# ANALYSIS

EC 20187−4939 was included in the coarse analysis of Jeffery et al. (2021), yielding effective temperature eff = 40.46±0.08 kK, surface gravity log /cm s −2 = 6.02 ± 0.04, and helium-to-hydrogen ratio log = 1.35 ± 0.13, from which follow hydrogen and helium number fractions H = 0.045 ± 0.015 and He = 0.945 ± 0.015. This work follows on from the coarse analysis in the following stages.

The HRS spectrum was used to measure equivalent widths of identifiable metal lines. The line broadening in the HRS spectrum is <5 km s −1 , which excludes significant stellar rotation. Following the procedure described by Jeffery et al. (2017), and assuming an LTE model atmosphere with parameters close to those from Jeffery et al. (2021), corresponding abundances were calculated from individual line curves-of-growth using the LTE spectral synthesis code (Jeffery et al. 2001). This provided a first estimate of the surface composition.

These initial abundances were used as input for a grid of non-LTE model atmospheres. This grid was used with the medium-resolution RSS spectral data to obtain new values for eff , log and He which consider non-LTE effects on the line profiles. The RSS spectrum was used in order to avoid the profiles of broad lines being affected by the joining of spectral orders, which occurs in the HRS spectrum.

With the atmospheric parameters from the non-LTE grid, a suite of non-LTE model spectra was calculated, varying the abundances of individual metals to create model curves of growth. These were used to measure abundances more accurately by taking into account the effects of other line opacities, as opposed to the single-line profile method used in the first LTE pass.

Finally, publicly available photometric data across a broad wavelength range were fit to model spectral energy distributions (SEDs), with the temperature and surface gravity obtained from the non-LTE grid fit as constraints. This was used to obtain estimates of the mass and radius of EC 20187−4939. Details of the determination of atmospheric parameters, abundances and SED fitting are given in the following subsections.


## Atmospheric parameters

Stellar atmosphere models and emergent spectra were computed using and (Hubeny & Lanz 2017a,b,c;Hubeny et al. 2021). These were then fitted to the data to obtain the atmospheric parameters.

The grid of and models ranged from 39 to 42 kK in temperature (steps of 1 kK) and from 5.75 to 6.25 in log /cm s −2 (steps of 0.25). The grid included hydrogen number fractions of H = 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01. Each model had a microturbulent velocity of 0. Metal abundances were taken from the results of the initial LTE analysis (see Sec. 3.2, Table 2), leaving a helium fraction of He = 1− H − Z , with Z being the number fraction of metals. The grid models included elements up to atomic number 30. Elements not listed in Table 2 were assumed to be at solar abundance, with values taken from Asplund et al. (2009). Opacity contributions were calculated for H, He, C, N, O and Fe in non-LTE. The grid models are summarised in Table 3. Information on the model atoms is listed in Tab. 4. The model atoms, which are distributed with version 208 of (Hubeny et al. 2021), used the NIST database 1 (Ralchenko & Kramida 2020) for level energies and the Opacity Project database 2 (Cunto et al. 1993) for photoionization cross sections. For Fe specifically, the Kurucz atomic database 3 was used. The medium-resolution data were chosen for the model grid fitting, since the profiles of the broad lines were affected by the joining of spectral orders in the high resolution data. The fitting was performed with the software (Jeffery et al. 2001) using a chi-squared minimisation procedure with extra weighting on the H and He lines.

A range of combinations of eff , log and He were able to provide a similar fit to the data. To break this degeneracy, the abundance ratio of N and N was measured for all temperatures in the grid at log /cm s −2 = 6. This was measured using the curve of growth method (see Sec 3.2). Least squares fitting was then used to find the temperature at which the abundances measured from both ions of N were equal. This temperature was then kept fixed whilst log and He were varied in the chi-squared minimisation. This gave eff = 40.78±0.35 kK, log /cm s −2 = 5.90±0.20 and H = 0.014±0.006.


## Abundances

The HRS spectrum was used to measure the equivalent widths of metal lines. Lines were included if there were no strong blends and if the depth exceeded 2 , where is the noise in the continuum. The equivalent widths are listed in Table 1. These equivalent widths were used to estimate abundances using the spectral synthesis code and the atmosphere modelling code. The model was calculated at eff = 40 kK, log /cm s −2 and He = 0.95. These LTE abundances were used to create the model grid described in Sec. 3.1 and are listed under the log ,LTE column of Table 2.

To perform the non-LTE abundance analysis, a model with the parameters obtained from the / model grid fit to the RSS data was computed. As in the model grid, the abundances were taken from the / LTE analysis. H, He and all metals listed in Table 2 were calculated in non-LTE.

Using this model, spectra were computed varying the abundance of individual metals. Nine model spectra were computed for each metal, where the logarithmic abundance varied between 0 − 2 and 0 + 2 in steps of 0.5, where 0 is the original logarithmic abundance. The equivalent widths of the metal lines were then measured in the model spectra at each abundance step (sometimes excluding the lowest abundances where the line was too weak to measure or the highest abundances where an emission core developed).

Combining the model curves of growth for each metal line with the equivalent widths from the HRS data (Table 1), an abundance for the corresponding ion was measured from each line. These were averaged to infer an abundance for the metal. In the case of N and Si, lines from both of the ions present in the spectrum were used together to give the abundance of the metal.

These measurements were done twice, with the second pass using the atmospheric structure of a model with abundances updated according to the results of the first pass. The abundance of an element was updated if its first pass abundance differed from the initial abundance by more than 0.5 dex. Thus, the final model used log C = 6.99, log N = 8.89, log Mg = 7.80 and log Si = 7.57, where the element is indicated by the subscript. Other elements remained the same as in the first pass. The final abundances measured  (Table 3) and the abundances listed under log in Table 2. Lines with theoretical equivalent widths > 20 mÅ are indicated.       from the second pass are listed in the log column of Table 2. The corresponding curves of growth are plotted in Fig 2, where the lines of the individual ions of N and Si have been separated for clarity.

## Spectral energy distribution

Photometric observations were used to fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the star using the fitting tool (Heber et al. 2018;Irrgang et al. 2021). This fit is shown in Fig. 3. The spectrum used for the fit was computed using the abundance analysis model ( Table 3). The photometric data showed an excess of flux in the red end; thus, a second component was used for the SED fitting. This was done for two cases: a stellar component and a blackbody. The surface gravity of the secondary component in the stellar case is not constrained by the SED and so was fixed at log /cm s −2 = 5.0 (an estimate for a main sequence star of roughly the temperature obtained from the fit). The results of the SED fitting are given in Table 5. For the blackbody fitting, a temperature of 4.2 +0.7 −0.6 kK was found for the secondary component. The ratio of the surface area of the blackbody with respect to the subdwarf was found to be 4.2 +0.8 −0.7 .


# DISCUSSION


## Atmospheric Parameters

EC 20187−4939 has been included as part of a wider survey of hot subdwarfs (Jeffery et al. 2021). This previous analysis differed from the current work by using an LTE grid for the fitting of eff , log and He , with a slightly coarser grid spacing in eff and log than in the current work. We departed from the methodology of Jeffery et al. (2021) by choosing to use the N ion balance to measure the temperature, which was then held fixed in the chi-squared minimisation fitting, and by using non-LTE atmosphere models. Nevertheless, our results for eff and log are in agreement with Jeffery et al. (2021), although we find a slightly higher He abundance. Figure 4 shows EC 20187−4939 with the other stars in the Jeffery et al. (2021) survey in the log − eff and log − eff planes. Its position in log − eff is not unusual, as it lies at the cool end of the cluster of sdO stars at log ∼ 6. In log − eff , it is one of the more H-deficient (high log ) stars present.


## Abundances

The metal composition of EC 20187−4939 is characterised by high N and low C and O, which is consistent with material processed by the CNO cycle. EC 20187−4939 therefore fits into the He-strong, carbon-weak category in the Drilling classification system (Drilling et al. 2013). Ne is slightly enriched compared to solar, whereas other metal abundances are similar to solar.

To better understand the abundance pattern of EC 20187−4939 and its relation to similar stars, Fig 5 shows its abundances of N, Ne and Si, which is used as a proxy for metallicity, along with those of other helium-rich hot subdwarfs and extreme helium stars for which these abundances have been measured. The solid black line represents scaled solar abundances. Since EC 20187−4939 is N-enriched, a dashed black line has been added to show the location of scaled solar abundance when the entire mass of C and O has been converted into N, as an approximation for the results of nuclear processing by the CNO cycle.

The abundances of EC 20187−4939 can be used to rule out certain formation processes. The hot flasher route, where a post-red giant branch star undergoes a He core flash and loses mass, can produce He-rich subdwarfs but does not appear to be consistent with the low C/N ratio (∼ 0.01) seen in EC 20187−4939. This is because the He core flash triggers convection which mixes C from the core to the surface of the star, leading to much higher C/N ratios of between ∼ 9.5 to ∼ 0.85 (Miller Bertolami et al. 2008).

White dwarf mergers are a likely formation channel for hot subdwarfs and nuclear processing such as alpha captures are expected to occur in the merger process (Zhang & Jeffery 2012). The 14 N( , ) 18 O and 18 O( , ) 22 Ne reactions present a route to form Ne from N-and He-rich material. The solid red line on the lefthand plot of Fig. 5 shows the path from solar metal abundances to CNO-processed (horizontal line) and then a locus of progressively more conversion of 14 N to 22 Ne (curved line). This curved line extends from 0% to 90% conversion of 14 N to 22 Ne. An equivalent path starting at 10 −0.5 times solar abundances is shown in dashed red, showing how a change in metallicity translates the path in the abundance plane.

The right-hand plot of Fig 5 shows N abundance versus Si abundance for the same stars. The vertical red lines are equivalent to the red paths in the left-hand plot; CNO processing moves the abundances upwards from the solid black to the dashed black line, then alpha captures onto 14 N move the abundances vertically downwards again. Assuming the Si abundance and the initial N abundance scale similarly with overall metallicity, then stars with lower Si abundance (e.g. Ton 414, SB 21 and LB 1766) would lie along the dashed red line on the left-hand plot whereas stars with solar Si abundance would lie along the solid red line.

The very high N abundance of EC 20187−4939 does not appear to be associated with a high metallicity, since its Si and Al abundances are roughly solar. If CNO cycle processing followed by alpha captures on 14 N is indeed the main route by which the N abundance in these stars is altered during evolution, then this indicates that either the merger was slow and cool enough that alpha captures were not frequent during formation or that this processed material was not mixed to the surface of the resultant star. Zhang & Jeffery (2012) produced models of He white dwarf mergers which can explain the He-and N-rich surface composition of EC 20187−4939. They proposed three formation processes: the slow, fast and composite mergers. In the slow merger case, the secondary star is disrupted into a cold disk which then slowly accretes onto the primary (over several million years). In the fast merger case, the secondary forms a hot corona around the primary after transferring its entire mass to the primary within a few minutes. The composite case is a mixture of the two, where only some material from the secondary forms a disk whilst the rest is contained in the hot corona. In all cases, triple-burning is expected to ignite as the material from the secondary collides with the surface of the primary. However, only in the fast merger and higher-mass composite mergers is the resultant 12 C mixed to the surface of the final merger product by convection. Thus, a low-C surface composition, as seen in EC 20187−4939, is consistent with a slow merger or low-mass (< 0.65 M ) composite merger. capture products such as 18 O and 22 Ne are also less abundant in these cases, again consistent with the low O abundance and only slightly enriched Ne abundance of EC 20187−4939.

Considering the lack of significant rotational broadening in the spectrum, EC 20187−4939 does not appear to be a fast rotator. This does not necessarily mean that it is not the product of a binary merger, as long as angular momentum can be dissipated sufficiently during the merging process. This is certainly possible through the formation of a viscous disk (Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974), which will deposit a small fraction of the total angular momentum onto the central star.

The case of collisionless disks (which are less efficient in dissipating angular momentum) was studied by Gourgouliatos & Jeffery (2006), who concluded that some angular momentum must be lost during the double He white dwarf merger, otherwise the fully contracted end product would be rotating supercritically. Schwab (2018) explored mass loss during the short post-merger giant phase as a mechanism for angular momentum dissipation, finding that three different mass loss schemes yielded slowly-rotating end products. Additional angular momentum may be lost through magneto-dipole radiation shortly after the merger (García-Berro et al. 2012). Therefore, the slow rotation of EC 20187−4939 does not exclude a double white dwarf merger as a formation route. Placing EC 20187−4939 in the context of other carbon-weak extreme helium stars and subdwarfs is difficult because of the small numbers available for comparison, and the wide range of surface hydrogen abundances observed within the sample. Inferring an evolutionary connection between EC 20187−4939 and, say, V652 Her, for which the double white-dwarf merger model is a strong contender Saio & Jeffery (2000), or J1845-4138, is tempting but requires confirmation via identification of additional stars with similar surface chemistry and mass.


## Spectral energy distribution

The SED fitting allowed a mass and radius to be found for EC 20187−4939 (  Zhang & Jeffery (2012) for the production of He-rich, C-poor hot subdwarfs by the composite merger route. Of the two secondary components used in the SED fitting (star and blackbody), the best fit was achieved with the star (see the flux residuals in Fig. 3). However, the mass of the secondary component in this case is very small (0.226 +0.045 −0.027 M ) considering its temperature of 4.8 +0.8 −0.7 kK. For the SED fit in Sec. 3, the secondary component was assumed to have log /cm s −2 = 5, which is on the upper end for a main sequence star at this temperature. The derived mass of 0.226 +0.045 −0.027 M is therefore effectively an upper limit (a lower assumed surface gravity would produce a lower mass). For comparison, the expected mass for a main sequence star at ∼ 4.8 kK is ∼ 0.7 M (using MESA Isochrones & Stellar Tracks; Choi et al. 2016). Thus, the excess red flux seen in the photometric data is unlikely to be a main sequence stellar companion.

The cause of the excess is possibly a contaminating infrared source, however there are no other Gaia sources in the vicinity. Except in the case of a chance alignment within less than 1", this excludes a blend.

In the case of treating the secondary source as a blackbody, the SED fitting found an effective surface area ratio of 4.2 +0.8 −0.7 between the blackbody and the subdwarf. By treating the blackbody source as a circular disk, its radius, bb , can be related to the radius of the subdwarf, * , as ( bb sin ) 2 / 2 * = 4.2, where is the inclination angle. As an example, bb ≈ 2 * for the range 0 • < < 60 • . Taking the subdwarf radius of 0.141 R from the SED fit, this corresponds to ≈ 0.3 R . It is possible that this relatively small size is consistent with the residue of a white dwarf merger. Whether the blackbody temperature of 4.2 +0.7 −0.6 kK is consistent depends on how recent the merger was, since the residue would likely cool and disperse after the event.


# CONCLUSIONS

We have analysed EC 20187−4939 using non-LTE / models. We have re-measured the temperature, surface gravity and helium abundance, finding good agreement with the previously published results in Jeffery et al. (2021). We now have metal abundances for the star, allowing it to be classified within the C-poor group of He-rich hot subdwarfs. The N abundance is particularly high and the Ne abundance provides a third key diagnostic.

Publicly available photometric data have been used to fit the SED and show the presence of an excess of flux at the red end. The origin of this extra flux does not appear to be explained by a stellar source due to inconsistencies between the fitted mass and temperature of the secondary component. There are no nearby stellar sources visible in photometric data which could have contributed to the infrared excess. A merger residue is potentially consistent, although this depends on how recent the merger event was. In any case, whether the secondary component is fitted as a star or a blackbody does not affect the fit of the primary component.

Whilst the sample size is too small to demonstrate an evolutionary connection between EC 20187−4939 and carbon-weak extreme helium stars and hot subdwarfs unequivocally, the low carbon and high helium abundances of EC 20187−4939, along with the mass of 0.44 +0.32 −0.19 M , are consistent with formation via a merger of lowmass helium white dwarfs (Zhang & Jeffery 2012). Mildly enhanced neon compared to solar also suggests alpha captures on 14 N occurred during the merger. Metal abundance measurements of more hot subdwarfs would be valuable to identify trends with helium abundance, temperature and surface gravity, which could allow evolutionary connections to be established more firmly.
