A Survey of Freshwater Gastropods in the Microrregião Serrana of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

In 1984 we received samples of freshwater gastropods from many localities of the State of Rio de Janeiro, sent by Fundação Nacional de Saúde for identification.In the past three years, aiming to elaborate a chart of planorbids of the State of Rio de Janeiro additional collecting was done by the authors in the area corresponding to the Microrregião Serrana of the state: Petrópolis, Teresópolis and São José do Vale do Rio Preto.The survey was extended to the neighbour towns, Guapimirim and Magé, in order to improve the knowledge of that poorly studied area.

The molluscs were collected from different suitable snail habitats: streams, rivers and marsh areas in the Atlantic forest as well as drainage and sewage ditches, wells, flood areas, ponds and irrigation canals.

Live snails were kept at the laboratory for a month in aquaria containing dechlorinated tap water and, at the bottom, a thin layer of a 2:1 mixture of screened reddish soil and ground oyster shells as a source of mineral nutrients.Snails were fed on fresh lettuce leaves.In the meantime specimens of Biomphalaria were exposed to artificial light in intervals of five days to determine possible infection with trematode larvae, mainly Schistosoma mansoni cercariae.The ten larger snails of each sample were preserved in Railliet-Henry's fluid after relaxation in a 0.05% nembutal solution and two of them were dissected under stereomicroscope for identification.Technical details were described elsewhere (SC Thiengo 1995 Técnicas Malacológicas, p. 255-265.In FS Barbosa, Tópicos em Malacologia Médica, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro).Samples of taxonomic importance were deposited at the Malacological Collection of Instituto Oswaldo Cruz/Fiocruz.

In all, 7 species of planorbids and 10 species of other freshwater gastropods were found in 15 localities at the studied area ( Although many different kinds of cercariae had been observed, no specimens were found infected with S. mansoni.

Up to now A. nordestensis had not been found in Rio de Janeiro.Its distribution comprises the states of Alagoas, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Maranhão, Minas Gerais, Pará, Paraná, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and São Paulo (WL Paraense 1975 Arq Mus Nac 55: 105-128).

The Asiatic thiarid M. tuberculata was introduced in the municipality of Guapimirim about thirty years ago by local fish raisers and became the dominant species in the tanks.Recently, albino specimens of Helisoma duryi (Wetherby, 1879), which do not occur naturally in Brazil, were found in the same municipality in aquaria of a fish raiser thus confirming that in spite of the ecological hazards from introduction of exotic species this situation is still occurring without any control.
