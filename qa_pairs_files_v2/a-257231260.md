## (s2) Study Selection
(p2.0) Three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched for all available articles written in English. The search was restricted to the 20 years following the publication date of the seminal works that prompted evidence-based checklists to enhance the quality of scientific reports. 3,12 The initial search was undertaken by 3 authors (L.V., A.M., G.M.). The search included Medical Subject Headings, key words, and matching synonyms relevant to the topic. The search strategies employed in the databases are presented in Supplemental Digital Content 2, available at: http://links.lww. com/JNPT/A417.

(p2.1) Based on titles and abstracts, studies clearly out of scope were manually excluded. Animal studies were not considered. To be eligible for inclusion, articles had to meet the following criteria: enrollment of participants with definite diagnosis of MS; administration of a rehabilitative intervention program (least duration: 2 weeks); and RCT design.  When the title or the abstract presented insufficient information to determine eligibility, the full text of each article was scrutinized. Based on the information in the full text, eligible studies were considered for data extraction. In case of disagreements, consensus was reached by discussion. To ensure homogeneity, weekly team meetings were held to cross-check the studies.
