## (s14) Inorganic Nanoparticles
(p14.0) Recent studies have proved the capacity of inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold, silver, iron oxide, titanium oxide, and silica nanoparticles, to translocate into the brain after entering the body. Furthermore, due to their limited excretion, they gradually accumulate in the brain, causing damage to neuronal cells and function impairments [86].
