## (s30) Other biomedical treatments
(p30.0) Bionanotechnology has long been studied and applied in various biomedical fields from diagnosis to treatment. Conventional specialty drugs can have many side effects, prompting researchers to find more optimal treatments. The characteristic of nanoparticles such as small size, large surface area, high stability and biocompatibility brings them great potential as effective agents in diseases treatment (Dutta et al. 2015).
