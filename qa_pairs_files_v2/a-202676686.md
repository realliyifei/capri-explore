## (s20) Smart Industrial Augmented Reality
(p20.0) The authors in [63] proposed an industrial ARarchitecture based on fog computing, named, Navantia's indus-trial AR(IAR). The use of IAR in smart industries leads to enhancing productivity. The proposed IAR architecture consists of three layers, such as IAR layer, edge layer, and cloud layer. The IAR layer includes ARdevices that use WiFi along with other wireless technologies for connectivity with the edge layer. The IAR layer devices interact with the edge layer through local edge layer gateways that provide lowlatency services, such as data caching and sensor fusion. The authors considered both scalability and caching in their architecture. However, they did not consider security which is required for safe operation. For example, an unauthorized user can access the system and interrupt proper operation of the system, which can lead to serious consequences.
