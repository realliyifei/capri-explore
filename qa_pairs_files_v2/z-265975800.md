## (s7) Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection history
(p7.0) Many studies reported that the antibody titer of people with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased more significantly than that without SARS-CoV-2 infection after receiving a single dose of vaccine, and a single dose of vaccine may be sufficient for them.Racine et al conducted a longitudinal study to compare the antibody response of 68 patients vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine (19 patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, RecoVax group; 49 patients never infected with SARS-CoV-2, NaiveVax group).In the RecoVax group, the median time, from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to the first vaccination (D1), was 262 days (IQR 102-275).Before vaccination, there were detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and after D1, the antibody level in this population increased from an average of 47.45 U/mL (IQR19.59-148.7) to higher than the upper limit of detection (>2500 U/mL).It remained at this level for about 6 months after D1.The antibody level in the NaiveVax group gradually increased to an average of 37.77 U/ mL (IQR 12.93-80.45)before the second dose of vaccine (D2) after D1.Two weeks after D2, the average antibody was 2177 U/mL (IQR 1605->2500 U/mL).However, about 6 months after D2, the antibody level dropped to an average of 720 U/mL (IQR 565-1269).Although the total antibody level against S protein increased after D2, the antibody level in NaiveVax group was always lower than that in RecoVax group (P <.001 at all-time points).These data indicated that people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a stronger antibody response after vaccination, and a single dose of vaccine caused a strong enough antibody immune response in the RecoVax group. [47]Similarly, Fraley et al compared the antibody responses of the group without SARS-CoV-2 infection history and the group with SARS-CoV-2 infection 30 to 60 days before D1 after BNT162b2 vaccination.Three weeks after the initial inoculation, antibody titers to the 3 S subunit antigens (S1, S2, RBD) were significantly higher in both groups than the baseline.Moreover, the antibody titers of all S antigens in the infection group were significantly higher than those in the uninfected group (P < .001). 4 weeks after the second inoculation, the titers of the 3 S subunit proteins antibody in the uninfected group were significantly higher than those at the third week.The antibody levels of S1 and S2 were significantly higher in the infected group, but the RBD antibody level did not change significantly.The titers of S1 and RBD antibodies in the infected group at the 3rd week were similar to those in the uninfected group at the 7th week, but the levels of S2 antibody in the infected group at the 3rd and 7th weeks were significantly higher than those in the uninfected group (P < .001).The study also found that although the N protein is contained in the SARS-CoV-2, only the S protein is the vaccine targeted antigen.So higher level of N protein antibody was found only in the infection group.There was no significant change in N protein antibody levels after vaccination in both groups.The research showed that the population infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a higher antibody level after single dose vaccination, roughly equivalent to those observed in uninfected population after 2 doses of vaccination.
