## (s2) Literature search strategy
(p2.0) Our literature search was conducted between September 2014 and March 2015 using Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, US). To identify relevant publications, we used the search string 'island* AND ecosystem*' together with IES specific terms on the article title, abstract and keywords. No restriction on publication date was set. We recognised that there might be publications covering similar issues that do not use the term 'ecosystem services' (Liquete et al. 2013). Thus the keywords used in the search strings for each thematic area were designed to be as general as possible. The search criteria were developed on the basis of a pilot study conducted between August and September 2014 which showed that many papers investigating islands' ecosystems and their services did not use the term 'ecosystem services' and that several studies investigated the ecology and biogeography of islands. Table 1 indicates how the search criteria were constructed, and lists the terminology adopted by three widely used ES nomenclatures (MA, 5 TEEB 6 and CICES 7 ) for the IES considered in the present study.
