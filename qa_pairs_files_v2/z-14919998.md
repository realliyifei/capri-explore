## (s12) Effects of Nutrients on Transcription Factors Gene Expression
(p12.0) The expression, and consequently the action, of transcription factors depend on the animals' physiological conditions and developmental stage, whereby the corresponding genes are expressed only at the appropriate times. In addition, definite nutrients, such as long-chain fatty acids, are able to regulate the expression of transcription factors. According to Bionaz et al. [111], several fatty acids might, to varying degrees, activate various PPAR isotypes, with PUFAs showing more affinity for PPARÎ±, which is encoded by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) gene [134].
## (s14) Tissue Uptake of Fatty Acids
(p14.0) Triglycerides stored in adipocytes might originate either from the uptake of fatty acids from the blood or from de novo synthesis. For uptake to occur, the circulating triglycerides present in lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons, must first undergo the action of the enzyme LPL and then be carried by fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), which is responsible for the transport of fatty acids into cells [141].
