## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) For the last decades, traffic congestion has caused significant impact in modern society. Despite the measures taken to reduce the impact it bestowed, traffic congestion is affecting the environment, health, and crippling the economy of many cities around the world in so many different levels. Generally, there are many factors that can cause traffic to congest, and it could be caused by either recurring factors such as insufficient capacity, unrestrained demand or ineffective management of capacity or caused by non-recurring factors such as incidents, construction work zones, bad weather or emergencies [1]. To this effect, the world is witnessing the rise in transportation as well as urban technology researches in addressing this issue. Some are focusing on detecting and classifying traffic congestion in order to provide timely and accurate information to vehicular drivers and transport authorities to take action. While many researches are utilizing on image and video analytics such as through satellites views, surveillance cameras, on-line images, there's a hype in researches utilizing VANET.

(p0.1) Vehicular communications have been extensively researched with the aim of enabling vehicles to exchange information among themselves, also with the infrastructure. This enables the collection of vehicles" traffic data that then ratifies the road traffic characteristics, including speed, density, flow, and travel time.
