## (s14) Challenges and Opportunities of Process-Based Soil Erosion Modelling in the Context of New and Improved Data Assessment Techniques
(p14.0) After viewing the limitations and opportunities of process-based soil erosion models, and soil and soil erosion assessment techniques, the following chapter aims to combine these aspects. It discusses the interaction and adaption of soil erosion models regarding parameterization, process understanding, scale, resolution, complexity and connectivity in respect of new and further developed assessment techniques. as flow velocity and flow path detection, as presented in Section 2.2.1 by Lin et al. [96]. While improved techniques will undoubtedly support validation interests and process understanding, it is debatable if workflows can be developed to include such data into soil erosion modelling and if the existing prediction tools can easily include such distributed, high-resolution data. The plan to integrate such data could lead to the need to further develop the simplified hydrological models, in many cases based on the kinematic wave, and cause the need to use more complex and computing power-intensive approaches, such as the Saint Venant equation.
