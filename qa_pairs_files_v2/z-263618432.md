## (s10) DISCUSSION
(p10.0) Diarrhea holds significant importance within the realm of radiotherapy considerations. Failing to promptly administer suitable treatment for this condition holds the potential to not only compromise the quality of life but also disrupt the continuity of radiotherapy implementation in cervical cancer cases. This could be prevented by the use of probiotics which reduces apoptosis among intestinal epithelial cells thereby helping the recovery of radiationdamaged epithelial cells. Additionally, they also increase the immune system response to pathogens [6]. Upon conducting a critical review of 2 articles about the efficacy of probiotics, it was discovered that this therapy has benefits for preventing diarrhea in cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
