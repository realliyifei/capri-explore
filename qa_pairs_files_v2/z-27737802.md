## (s9) Statins May Reduce Breast Cancer Mortality
(p9.0) Murtola et al. [67] conducted a cohort study in Finland involving 31,236 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry over the period 1995-2003 and followed them for a median 3.25 years after the diagnosis.They concluded that those patients who used statins were at lesser at risk to die from their disease.Neither the stage of the disease (localized or metastatic breast cancer) nor the time at which statin use was started (before or after breast cancer diagnosis) seemed to affect the beneficial role of statins.In addition the lowered risk correlated with the dose of statin use especially for pre-diagnostic usage.Differences in age, tumor characteristics and treatment selection between statin users and non-users did not alter the risk decrease.Other antilipidaemic drugs like fibrates did not possess the protective effect when given to patients of similar age, tumor and treatment characteristics.Competing causes of death or the likelihood that patient could decrease statin usage at the end of life did not seem to undermine the decreased risk observed.Major strengths of this study include the large number of patients and detailed knowledge on timing, dosage and duration of statin use.
