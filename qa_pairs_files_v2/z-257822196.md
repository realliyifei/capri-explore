## (s2) Empirical Evidences for the Planetary Origin of Solar and Climate Variability Cycles
(p2.0) Several academics have recently investigated the idea that the planets of the solar system might have an impact on solar activity since, especially over the last 15 years, more and more scientific data have been discovered to support this hypothesis. Many of these findings were examined by Scafetta and Bianchini [26]. Let us now overview the most supporting evidences. Section 3.1 demonstrates that realistic tidal models predict a tidal cycle of 10-12 years, which corresponds to the observed Schwabe 11-year sunspot cycle. Section 3.2 provides additional data in support of a planetary synchronized solar dynamo hypothesis.
## (s14) Conclusions
(p14.0) The scientific evidences presented in Section 2 suggest that the Sun is subject to planetary influence from monthly to millennial timescales. The most frequently documented solar cycles are those with periods of 0. Many of these oscillation are also found in climate records and could be used to forecast an important component of the natural climate variability [48,85]. On the contrary, the idea that changes in solar activity might be only governed by internal dynamo mechanisms appears to still fall short of fully explaining why all of these solar cycles coincide with the most significant planetary periods derived from the planets' orbits, spring tides, synodic cycles, and invariant inequalities.
