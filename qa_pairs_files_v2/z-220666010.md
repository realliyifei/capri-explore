## (s10) Other non-antibiotic approaches
(p10.0) A systematic review evaluated a range of non-antibiotic approaches to manage uncomplicated UTIs including cranberry products, Canephron N (a phytodrug), probiotics (Lactobacillus spp.), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, diclofenac), D-mannose, estrogens, vitamins (C and D), and immunotherapy. 49 The review captured RCTs and observational studies published from 1999 to 2019, which involved generally healthy adult non-pregnant women with no risk factors for recurrent UTIs. The overall conclusion was that the evidence was insufficiently conclusive to recommend non-antibiotic options in place of antibiotic usage, although incorporating some of these measures in the management strategy of UTIs may contribute to avoidance of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence for the role of these non-antibiotic approaches in the elderly population is currently lacking.
