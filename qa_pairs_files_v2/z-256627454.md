## (s4) Complete Case Analysis
(p4.0) Complete case analysis is a widely used technique for handling missing outcomes. In this methodology, individuals who have missing values in any of the variables under analysis are discarded. This method is simple but generally inefficient, since it may lead a substantial reduction of the sample size. The fact that individuals are removed when a single variable is missing makes this worse. Additionally, when the missingness mechanism depends on the outcome variable Y , complete case analysis may lead to biased estimators [15].
