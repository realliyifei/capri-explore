## (s16) Assessment of risk of bias in the included studies
(p16.0) Review authors (SORL and VPSS) will independently assess risk of bias in each study using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [19]. Disagreements will be solved through consensus or involving a third review author (ESRV).

(p16.1) Risk of bias will be assessed according to the following domains: Random sequence generation (selection bias): description of the method used to generate allocation sequence to verify whether it should produce comparable groups. Any important concerns about other possible sources of bias will be described and classified as low, high or unclear risk of bias.

(p16.2) Allocation concealment (selection bias): description of the method for allocation concealment before assignment, and assessment of whether allocation to intervention could have been foreseen before or during recruitment or changed after assignment.
