## (s14) FGFR1
(p14.0) Amplification of fgfr1 occurs in approximately 20% of patients with scc of the lung 57 . The fgfr pathway plays a key role in signal transduction in lung cancer. Activation is responsible for igniting the pi3k/akt and Ras/mapk pathways that stimulate growth and angiogenesis in several cancers, including scc 58 . Amplification of fgfr is associated with smoking and confers a worse prognosis 59,60 .
