## (s7) Polyelectrolyte complexation
(p7.0) Systems to produce this type of NPs can be very similar to that used in either ionotropic gelation, spraying/drying or coacervation with Na 2 SO 4 . The substantial difference with theses consists of the macromolecular nature of the employed polyanions in order to obtaining a polyelectrolyte complex (polyplexes), i.e., it can highlight the use of DNA to obtain this type of NMs. 38 A very important advantage of these systems is that they allow obtaining nanoparticles with positive or negative external charges, depending on which polyelectrolyte solution is allowed to drip on the solution of the other. Additionally, it is possible to construct NPs with a variable number of layers, which can be formed by alternating immersion of the initial NPs in the solutions of the polyelectrolytes of interest. Figure  2 shows a hypothetical molecular arrangement of both polyelectrolytes when drops of an aqueous solution of chitosan are dropped onto an aqueous solution containing a macromolecular polyanion. It is important to indicate that even when the initially formed spheres can exceed the nano scale, their size decreases considerably when they are thermally dried.
