## (s2) Genome Data Sets
(p2.0) The complete genomes of 2,765 prokaryotic (2,600 bacterial and 165 archaeal) organisms available in December 2013 were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ftp site (ftp:/ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/ Bacteria/) and constituted the primary data source. Closely related organisms were not excluded as evolutionary differences (presence/absence of the tRNA gene array, loss/gain of a tRNA gene within an array) in species belonging to the same genus could be observed. The A. ferrivorans CF27 genome (accession number CCCS020000000) was retrieved from the MicroScope website (https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/ microscope/) (Vallenet et al. 2013) under the AcidithioScope project.
