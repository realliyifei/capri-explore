## (s2) Data Sources and Search
(p2.0) Strategy. The search and data extraction stages were performed based on the PRISMA checklist [23]. Articles were extracted by searching the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. A combination of MeSH terms and keywords related to dashboards, usability, and questionnaires was used for the search strategy ( Table 1). The final search of articles was carried out without any time restrictions. Two researchers (SA and SS) searched and retrieved articles independently, and any disagreement was discussed with the senior author (RR).
