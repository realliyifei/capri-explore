## (s5) Fixation interface
(p5.0) For a long time, fixation failure has been an important cause of revision [27]. Artificial joints are mainly fixed with bone cement or biological fixation. Cemented fixation is realized by using fast-drying bone cement to "glue" the prosthesis and the bone together. The biological fixation is achieved by press-fit, and the prosthesis is specially textured or fabricated in a porous structure to allow bone ingrowth. The optimal fixation, whether cemented fixation or cementless fixation, has been an area of debate for decades.
