## (s12) Discussion
(p12.0) We found that BTURP has significantly less reduction in serum sodium postoperatively when compared to MTURP. Various theories have been postulated for this, one of which is that 0.9% Sodium Chloride is a physiological fluid and therefore causes less tissue toxicity and also helps with replacing any fluid losses as stated by El-Assmy et al 18 Also, the "cut and seal" mechanism offered by BTURP which leads to nonpassage of current through patient's body and rather through the loop could cause lesser interaction between irrigating fluid and the microvascular channels created intraoperatively. This could also be attributed to a wider knowledge of TUR syndrome and therefore surgeons being more aware of time restrictions for MTURP.

(p12.1) We also did not find a significant drop in Hematocrit post BTURP, which could also possibly be attributed to the cut and seal mechanism as it helps coagulate while resecting. The concomitant vaporization and hemostasis are also postulated to help improve intraoperative vision as stated by Ene et al 23 There have been concerns about BTURP causing more thermal injury and therefore causing a higher risk of urethral strictures.
