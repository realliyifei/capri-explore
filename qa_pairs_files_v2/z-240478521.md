## (s22) Future Prospects
(p22.0) Horticulture plays a key role in the economy of countries with a temperate climate. Unfortunately, horticultural crops are affected by several diseases, compromising the economic return of the farmers. In this context, better crop protection strategies require a close synergy between the research community, seed companies, and farmers, trying to fulfil needs of consumers interested in healthy products of high quality.

(p22.1) Here, we have outlined the major and most dangerous pathogens that affect tomato crop in the Mediterranean area and their effects on the cultivation of this important horticultural crop. Considering the tremendous impacts of pesticides on water quality and plants and animals and their linkage with several negative effects on human health, including short-term sickness and several kind of cancers; sustainable agricultural practices, such as crop rotation, precocious detection and prompt eradication of infected plants; and use of resistant varieties, certified propagation material, or chemical prophylaxis against insect vectors, are all strategies useful to contain pathogen infections and reduce the use of pesticides. Nonetheless, innovative strategies of pathogen containment must be adopted at the global level to implement a transition towards sustainable agricultural practices and sustainable living behaviours based on lower pesticide inputs and reduced food loss and food waste. Promising strategies also include the adoption of innovative cultural practices and innovative lighting sources to optimize plant growth. In particular, the technologies based on LEDs are particularly attractive for indoor cultivation of horticultural crops, eliciting not only photomorphogenic and biochemical traits but also physiological responses suitable to counteract pathogen attack [354].
