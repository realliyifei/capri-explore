## (s14) Post-harvest handling of ginger
(p14.0) Ginger requires optimal processing methods, storage types and mechanisms for the domestic and the export markets.Due to its different active ingredients, ginger is considered a safe medicinal plant with few significant side effects. [169]However, the traditional processing methods and storage pose challenges to ginger production and use.In processing, drying is the most widely used technique to preserve ginger, since fresh ginger contains a high-water content (80-95%) that can lead to microbial spoilage.Poor post-harvest handling and storage of fresh ginger results in reduced shelf life and significant post-harvest losses.These problems challenge ginger producers and processors in developing countries who may not have access to up-to-date methods.
