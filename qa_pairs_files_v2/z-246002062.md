## (s7) Assessment of study quality
(p7.0) Nine studies underwent the initial quality assessment and two studies were omitted; one lacked sufficient information to make an assessment [46] and one contained a measure of association for clinical pregnancy that fell outside the confidence interval (OR 0.14, 95% CI: 0.3-0.7) [47]. Study authors could not be reached to correct this error [47] (Table 1). Seven studies were rated as "acceptable" quality and were included in the review. In included studies, potential selection bias and reliability of exposure assessment were the most common inadequately addressed items (items 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.12, Table 1).
