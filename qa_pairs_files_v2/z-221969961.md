## (s16) EMBARC (Establishing Moderators/Mediators for a Biosignature of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care)
(p16.0) is a public data set made available by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). It recognizes the neurological sign of reaction to antidepressant treatment by using the resting-state EEG and machine learning algorithm. A total of 16 posterior electrodes were comprised of P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, PO3, PO4, PO7, PO8, POz, O1, O2, and Oz. [140].
