## (s24) Conclusions
(p24.0) This review presented the energy trilemma perspective for MG-EMS by categorizing the objectives, control and optimization methods in terms of flexibility, affordability, and security.The focus is given to the MAS and MPC-based approaches with different control architectures for energy management in MGs.The objectives that affect each element of the energy trilemma are presented in detail.The literature was scanned for MAS and MPC-based control methods from the energy trilemma perspective, and several inferences made from the existing research.The detailed analysis of MAS and MPC approaches, optimization methods, and their constituents to achieve the energy trilemma presented in this review can provide a fresh perspective for MGs-EMS.The MAS and MPC methods are used in all types of control architectures.However, MAS control complexities rise due to interactions and market transactions [170] in interconnected MGs.Incorporating AI-based machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms in the MAS-based methods has drawn attention recently to developing EMS for MGs with ICT technologies.Though the MPC approaches are used widely in developing EMS due to their fast dynamic response and reactive features in handling uncertainties, they require high computational power.Adaptive predictive control with AI and hybrid control techniques and practical SoS methods such as logical evolution operator-based techniques (epsilon operator) are employed in MPC to decrease the computational complexity.Finally, future recommendations and analysis related to stability, scalability, and resiliency of MGs-EMS that affect flexibility, affordability, and security in addition to EMS algorithm improvements are presented to benefit the MG research community.
