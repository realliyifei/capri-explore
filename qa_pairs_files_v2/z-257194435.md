## (s15) Effects on fertility
(p15.0) An ethanol extract from the cambogia seeds was administered to male rats 6 days a week to examine its impact on testis histology as well as the sperm count for 6 weeks.The extract increased the sperm count and interstitial spaces considerably at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg BW/day, causing degenerating and distorting the cells of the sperm series in all experimental rats. [18]The level of testis meiosis-aktivating sterol, which may be responsible for the transmission of the spermatogenesis signal, was reduced by oral administration at 102 mmol/kg of BW to male rats, which is intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis.The serum hormone levels -follicle-stimulating hormones, luteinizing hormone, estradiol and progesterone -have not changed in female rats, shows a subsequent study by the same group that (−) HCA administered at a dose of 154 mmol kg−1 day−1 for 4 weeks.The concentrations of follicle and corpus luteum, the follicular fluid ovarienic meiosis-activating sterol and the sterol testis have not changed over the course of the treatment.After treatment, body weight and abdominal fat decreased (Shaik et al.,  2017). [44]xicity of Garcinia cambogia

(p15.1) The majority of research agrees that taking Garcinia cambogia in the recommended quantities, which is up to 2,800 mg of HCA per day, is safe for healthy persons.Garcinia cambogia has also been linked to certain negative side effects.Digestive problems, headaches, and skin rashes are the most prevalent.However, more significant adverse effects have been reported in other trials.Garcinia cambogia consumption well beyond the maximum suggested dosage has been shown in animal tests to induce testicular atrophy, or shrinkage of the testicles.It has been shown in rats that it can influence sperm production.One lady suffered serotonin poisoning as a result of taking Garcinia cambogia with her antidepressant medicines, according to one study.Furthermore, numerous case studies show that Garcinia cambogia pills may cause liver damage or even death in certain people [45]
