## (s3) Patient & disease characteristics
(p3.0) Minimum and maximum values for each trial arm are used to describe the demographic and disease characteristics shown in Figure 1. Patient age and sex were fairly consistent between studies, with single-arm trials and RCTs in 1L and 2L settings enrolling patients aged 59-68 years (mean) or 51-73 years (median); 71-93% of patients were male. The proportion of patients from the Asia-Pacific region varied widely. Trials included a wide range of patients with vascular invasion (0-88%) and extrahepatic spread (21-86%).

(p3.1) There appeared to be a relationship between the proportion of patients enrolled from Asia-Pacific versus the prevalence of hepatitis B, but not the prevalence of hepatitis C (Supplementary Figure 2), which was expected given the regional epidemiology of hepatitis B [95].
