## (s2) Australia
(p2.0) Australia has a rich history in the field of neutron scattering.A major milestone in the history was the construction of the 10-MW High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) in 1958, which began to be utilized for neutron scattering research in the late 1960s until it was finally shut down in 2007 [25].In response to the need for a new, state-of-the-art neutron scattering facility, the Australian government initiated the construction of the Open-Pool Australian Lightwater (OPAL) research reactor at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), which became operational in 2007.The OPAL reactor is a modern, 20-MW multipurpose research reactor that provides a reliable and powerful neutron source for a diverse array of neutron scattering instruments.Currently, a total of 15 neutron instruments are available to users, six of which can perform polarized neutron experiments.
