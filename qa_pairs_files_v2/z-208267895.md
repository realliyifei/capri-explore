(p4.0) Paper Title: RP-2-Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Aggregation Based on Blockchain for Power Grid Communications in Smart Communities [11]. Problem Addressed: Real-time data from user appliance is required for optimal scheduling of Smart grids but it also means disclosing users private information and raise the issue of privacy. Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a privacy-preserving and efficient data aggregation scheme. Where users are divided into groups and attached with a blockchain to record data for the group members. Pseudonyms are being used to hide user identity within the group. Users are free to create as many pseudonyms and can associate their data with it. To ensure a fast authentication boom filter has been used.
