(p32.0) User identification on the basis of free texts has been performed in [53]. As mentioned in Section 4.2, three different views, namely time series of alphabet keystrokes, special character keystrokes, and accelerometer values, have been there employed to represent the collected data. A deep learning approach based on recurrent neural networks has been then used to separately model each considered time series. Specifically, three gated recurrent unit bidirectional recurrent neural networks, trained with a RMSprop approach with Nesterov momentum, process the considered views to extract discriminative representations, with the last layers of each network concatenated before performing identification. Network training is performed for an increasing number of enrolled users, from only two to all the 26 available subjects, to evaluate the behaviour of the achievable accuracy. As expected, given well-known properties of identification processes, the achievable performance worsens as long as the number of considered user increases.
