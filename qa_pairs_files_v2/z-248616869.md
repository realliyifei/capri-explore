## (s14) Proposition 3.12. [7, Proposition 3.5] Suppose
(p14.0) is strictly increasing on (0, ∞) and on −∞, 1 A(ν) . Proof. It is known ( [10]) that the function k ν (.) is strictly increasing on (0, ∞), we will use the same reasoning to show that it is also increasing on −∞, 1 A(ν) . We first observe that for θ ∈ −∞, 1 A(ν) , the expression (1 − θx) is negative for all x in the support of ν. In fact,
