## (s13) Multi-Omics Fusion Strategies
(p13.0) Multi-omics data fusion integrates information from multiple omics modalities to capture intra-omics and cross-omics interactions for a deeper insight into biological processes and better decision-making. It can leverage the interactions and supplementary information among omics data to provide richer knowledge compared to single omics learning. 125 Researchers have proposed a growing number of methods to fuse multi-omics data. We categorize all developed methods as shown in Figure  3 and discuss them in the following subsections.
