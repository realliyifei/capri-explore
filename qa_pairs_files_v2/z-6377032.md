## (s10) Alemtuzumab
(p10.0) Alemtuzumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen present at high levels on especially T and B lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab acts through antibodydependent cellular cytolysis and complement-mediated lysis following cell surface binding. The mechanism by which alemtuzumab exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is suggested to be by a depletion and repopulation of lymphocytes that reduces the potential for relapses and thereby delays disease progression [46]. Alemtuzumab is administered by intravenous infusion for two treatment courses. The initial treatment course is 12 mg/day for five consecutive days (60 mg total dose), and the second treatment course is 12 mg/day for three consecutive days (36 mg total dose) administered 12 months after the initial treatment course. Additional courses may be given 12 months after the latest treatment course if necessary. Based on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) licence alemtuzumab has indication as a first-line medication in active RRMS. Because the treatment increases the risk of secondary autoimmunity, most European neurologists would use this drug as a second-line preparation, however.
