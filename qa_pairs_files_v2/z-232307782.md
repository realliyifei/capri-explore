(p4.0) Let T 1 be the set of all semicomplete digraphs T satisfying the following: there exists a vertex u such that uv, vu ∈ A(T ) for any v ∈ V (T ) \ {u}. The following result concerns the structure of a minimal separator in a strong semicomplete composition Q = T [H 1 , . . . , H t ] when T ∈ T 1 .

(p4.1) Theorem 2.1 [58] Let Q = T [H 1 , . . . , H t ] be a strong semicomplete composition with T ∈ T 1 . Then every minimal separator S of Q induces in U (Q) a subgraph which consists of some connected components of U (Q). Moreover, each vertex s ∈ S is adjacent to every vertex of Q − S.

(p4.2) Note that the above result may not hold when T ∈ T 1 . Consider the following example [58]: let T be a semicomplete digraph such that for each j ∈ [t], u 1 u j , u j u 1 ∈ A(T ) and H i is a cycle of length four: u i,1 , u i,2 , u i,3 , u i,4 , u i,1 .

(p4.3) is a minimal separator of Q, and U (Q) consists of 2t components (each component is an edge). Clearly, the edge {u 1,1 , u 1,3 } is one such component, however, u 1,1 ∈ S and u 1,3 ∈ S.
