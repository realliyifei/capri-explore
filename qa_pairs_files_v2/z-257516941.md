## (s10) Discussion
(p10.0) Times have changed, and being considered fat has become the target of negativity, ending the era of "fat is beauty".Over the years, the standard of beauty has changed, and what was previously considered acceptable is now characterized as "ugly," "disease," and "shame," making thinness a goal to be achieved.There is a great emphasis in AN on adolescence, given that it is characterized as a troubled stage of life where individuals start their self-knowledge process, overcome biopsychological changes, and initiate relationships independent of their parents.In this period, peer interactions are established, so it is "doing everything to be accepted" and "to be considered cool."Specifically, it is usual for girls to follow fashion trends and standard bodies, damaging their self-image just because they do not have what social networks transmit.Variables such as economic success, happiness and attractiveness are associated with thinness and visibility.Adolescents who follow this reasoning do not feel satisfied with themselves, adopt strict diets, and believe that this is the only way they will be included in society.

(p10.1) Given the present historical time, it is impossible not to mention the pandemic.According to Walsh and McNicholas (2020), several obstacles were experienced by adolescents with AN during COVID-19, namely the inability to "escape" from parental control during meals and the inability to leave the house to exercise.On the other hand, advantages were also felt, like adolescents remained isolated at home and reduced social comparison (Walsh & McNicholas, 2020).
