## (s9) Physical Barrier
(p9.0) The intrinsic defense of the placenta is entrenched in its unique microarchitecture. The outermost syncytiotrophoblast cells form a fused multinucleated cell layer, lacking intercellular gap junctions that can be exploited by microorganisms through intercellular unions [82].
## (s10) Chemical Barrier: Cytokines, Exosomes, and microRNAs Cytokines
(p10.0) The placenta secretes antimicrobial components that target a wide range of viruses. Interferons (IFNs) are key cytokines involved in innate host defense against pathogens, particularly RNA viruses, DNA viruses, intracellular bacteria, and parasites [85]. There are three types of IFNs namely type I IFNs (including IFN-α, β, ε, τ, and δ), type II IFN (IFN-γ) and type III IFNs (IFN-λ1, λ2, λ3, and λ4). While type I IFNs function in a broad systemic manner, type III IFNs control infection locally restricted to barrier surfaces including the maternal-fetal interface, blood-brain barrier, gastrointestinal, and respiratory epithelial surfaces.
