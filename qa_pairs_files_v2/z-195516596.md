## (s4) GDPR Implementation
(p4.0) In order to comply with the Regulation and avoid fines, organizations must adopt protection policies and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the processing of personal data is in accordance with GDPR. This measures include pseudonymization, encryption, maintaining a record of the processing activities, and applying Privacy by Design and by Default principles. Furthermore, organizations must also be able to demonstrate compliance to Supervisory Authorities (European Commission, 2016). Besides technological challenges, GDPR also brings a lot of juridical and functional changes, along with the necessity to educate staff and change their mindset and culture to this new paradigm (Freitas and Mira da Silva, 2018). Since GDPR imposes a lot of changes and challenges, organizations will need to review their processes, routines and procedures, in order to ensure that they collect, hold and process personal data in accordance with the Regulation (Tikkinen-Piri et al., 2018).
