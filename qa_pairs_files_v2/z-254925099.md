## (s28) Carbon tetrachloride
(p28.0) Carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ), a known hepatotoxic agent, has been used as an effective solvent and cleaning agent in industrial manufacturers (101). Exposure to CCl 4 leads to liver injury and increases levels of GDH, ALP, ALT, and AST (101). EA (10 mg/kg, IP) protected the rat liver against CCl 4 toxicity (102). CCl 4 exposure induces cirrhosis through the activation of ROS formation and angiogenesis by expressing vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and increasing caspase-3 activity. These aforementioned effects were noticeably reversed by EA administration (103). EA (15 mg/kg, PO) supplementation also effectively diminished the plasma levels of ALT, AST, and albumin, and significantly suppressed the gene expression of iNOS and collagen I in cirrhosis mice (103) ( Table 5).
