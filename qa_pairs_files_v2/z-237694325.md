## (s25) Compressive Strength Prediction Model
(p25.0) Compressive strength of GSP is assessed by Cube compressive strength test. The values have a linear relationship with that of grouted hydrated cement mortar [137]. The expression is shown as below:
## (s74) Compressive Strength Prediction Model
(p74.0) Compressive strength of GSP is assessed by Cube compressive strength test. The values have a linear relationship with that of grouted hydrated cement mortar [137]. The expression is shown as below:
