## (s2) Search Strategy
(p2.0) A comprehensive search of literature was carried out using electronic databases including Clinical Trials.gov, Medline, PubMed, Science direct, Google scholar to identify relevant studies in August 2020. Criteria for inclusion in this review were: (1) human adults (aged 18 and over), (2) dietary brown seaweed intervention (either Ascophyllum nodosum or Fucus vesiculosus; or in combination), (3) included anthropometric parameters, inflammatory markers, glucose, insulin, blood lipids and energy intake as an outcome and (4) written in English. Owing to the small number of eligible papers, trials both with and without dietary restriction were included in spite of the potential for weight change to influence results and there was no limit placed on follow-up or study duration. Papers were omitted if they were not original research or if the study involved cell culture or animal models. An overview of the clinical trials included in the review are summarised in Table 1.
