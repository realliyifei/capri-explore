## (s16) Heterologous biosynthesis of surfactin
(p16.0) Heterologous expression of genes involved in the surfactin biosynthesis pathway has been challenging because of the large size of the srfA operon and the complex biosynthetic regulation by quorum sensing.

(p16.1) Wild-type B. subtilis 168 cannot synthesize surfactin because there is a stop codon in sfp, which plays an important part in surfactin synthesis.Wang et al. [87] integrated the complete sfp in B. subtilis 168, and the surfactin yield of the recombinant strain reached 0.45 g/L.
