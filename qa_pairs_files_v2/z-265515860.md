## (s6) Clinical Studies and Quality of Evidence
(p6.0) Most studies that supported or warned against NET insertion in patients with known EVs were limited by a small sample size, a lack of a comparison group, or a lack of randomization (â–ºTable 3).

(p6.1) Al Obaid et al's study is one of the largest and most recent studies to date to assess the risk of variceal bleeding after NET insertion in patients with known EVs. 20 In this retrospective study, 11 out of 75 patients had gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) within 48 hours of NET placement.It was also noted that a higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score and lower EV location were associated with a higher risk of GIB after NET placement.This study raises the concern that this risk of GIB after NET placement does actually exist although the risk is low.However, this is a noncontrolled study and these findings could be incidental.In addition, the type and cause of GIB were not specified, raising the question of whether the GIB was actually due to variceal bleeding versus other causes of upper or lower GIB.
