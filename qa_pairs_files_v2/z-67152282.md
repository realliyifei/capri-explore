## (s10) Conclusion
(p10.0) Eyelid defects form one of the challenging areas of reconstruction because of the highly specialized anatomy. The reconstruction of full-thickness eyelid defects is best approached using an algorithm of techniques based on defect size. 35 This requires careful assessment of the defect, including horizontal measurement under gentle tension. Combination of several techniques may be needed in the repair of complex eyelid reconstructions. The availability of tissues, technical expertise, and the specific needs of the patient have to be kept in mind before choosing a particular method. The procedure which produces functional improvement and best cosmetic result and is most convenient for the surgeon, should be the procedure of choice.
