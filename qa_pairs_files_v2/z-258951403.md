## (s23) Concept and Implementation of Mass Customization and Its Benefits for Prosthetic Socket Design
(p23.0) Mass customization in upper limb prosthetic design aims to provide personalized, effective, and accessible devices that satisfy individual user preferences and needs while maintaining the cost-efficiency and scalability associated with mass production. The concept revolves around employing modular components, digital design and fabrication, customer involvement, and automated, streamlined processes to create prosthetic devices tailored to specific users, ultimately leading to enhanced fit, comfort, improved functionality, increased user satisfaction, rapid iteration and refinement, and greater accessibility.

(p23.1) Ulrich [38] emphasized the role of product architecture in facilitating the implementation of mass customization through modular components. Modularity provides the flexibility and adaptability manufacturers require to cater to different user requirements by offering a range of interchangeable parts in various sizes, shapes, and functionalities. This approach simplifies the manufacturing process while enabling the production of personalized prosthetic devices that precisely match users' unique needs.
