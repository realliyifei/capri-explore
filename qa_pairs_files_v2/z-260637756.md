## (s19) Mucormycosis
(p19.0) Extensive necrosis with numerous large (6-30 Î¼m in diameter), branching, and non-septate hyphae at the periphery are seen upon histopathologic examination of the lesional tissue. [24]The hyphae typically branch at 90-degree angles.Without a doubt, the propensity of fungi for invasion of small blood vessels accounts for the significant tissue damage and necrosis associated with this disease.Due to the disruption of the normal blood flow to the tissue, infarction, and necrosis occur.Thus, angioinvasion with vessel thrombosis and tissue necrosis is the pathological hallmark of mucormycosis. [25]
## (s30) Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma.
(p30.0) Tumor necrosis is associated with a worse prognosis in several solid cancers.The degree of tumor necrosis influenced outcome in NK/T-cell lymphoma patients. [50]umor necrosis and complete resection are concluded to be novel independent prognostic factors in patients with upper aerodigestive tract. [50]
