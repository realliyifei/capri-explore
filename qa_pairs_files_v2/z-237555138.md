## (s1) Breast cancer
(p1.0) According to a global cancer statistics study, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and among the leading cause of cancer-related death in females (27) (Figure 4). Although there is an evident increase in breast cancer incidence and mortality among pre-and postmenopausal women, females of younger age are also at risk every year, with higher emphasis in developing countries (28). Hence, although advanced therapies and early detection have improved the survival rate (29), the causal factors of breast carcinoma still remain elusive.
