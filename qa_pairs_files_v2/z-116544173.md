## (s14) Kinetics and Thermal Conductivity Properties
(p14.0) For a specific chemical reaction applied for TES, the progress of the chemical reaction is much faster than the rate of thermal conductivity, as a result, the rate-limiting step of this chemical heat storage system is the rate of thermal conductivity [19]. Besides the heat transfer ability of the storage tank and internal heat exchanger, the most significant issue is the thermal conductivity of materials.
