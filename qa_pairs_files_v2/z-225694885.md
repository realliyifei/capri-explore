## (s7) British Society of Gastroenterology
(p7.0) This guideline focused on the management of adults diagnosed with CD and was based on the opinions of a panel of 21 individuals [13]. A regular review for the first 12 months after commencement of a strict GFD with a dietitian and a gastroenterologist was recommended, with subsequent annual review thereafter. Encouragement was given to join a coeliac support organisation. The regular assessment of micronutrient status, clinical state and serology was detailed along with regular assessment of adherence. Follow-up SBB should be considered but was recommended in those who appeared non-responsive to a GFD. Additional comments included ensuring adequate calcium, screening for osteoporosis and the consideration of inclusion of oats. Recommendations were supported by Grade C and D levels of evidence.
