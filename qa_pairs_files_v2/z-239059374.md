(p3.0) The investigated andrographolide potential effects on breast cancer development and inhibition of neovascularization and the precise mechanisms involved. This study demonstrates the andrographolide potential anticancer effect, which can inhibit COX-2 expression by reducing PX-HAT activity and inhibiting angiogenesis through the VEGF pathway. Cancer drugs can help treat breast cancer [13].

(p3.1) The effect of andrographolide on NFkB activation mediated by caspase-8 apoptosis, pyroptosis, and axon matrix degradation (ECM) in MW-MB231 of A431 and the SKOV-3 cell line. The results showed that andrographolide inhibits the growth and growth of tumor cell lines by inhibiting NFRB signaling. As the concentration of andrographolide increases, the expression of the tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1) increases significantly. Induction of TIMP1 inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and inhibits ECM degradation. Andrographolide does not cause microbial toxicity to tumor cells, it exhibits cytotoxicity through the NFkB signaling pathway, and inhibits the development of ovarian and breast cancer by inhibiting MMP-7 expression through TMPP1 overregulation. This drug is made for ovarian cancer and breast cancer [14].
