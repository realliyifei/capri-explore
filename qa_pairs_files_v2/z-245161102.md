## (s8) "Pseudo-Oligomeric" Surfactants
(p8.0) As stated above (Section 5.1), a strong association of anionic and cationic single-chain surfactants may be treated as a formation of a "pseudo-gemini" betaine surfactant species comprising anionic and cationic polar groups and two tails from both surfactants. However, such associations are transient and usually sensitive to salts.

(p8.1) A recently proposed interesting approach consists in the non-covalent self-assembly of "ordinary" single-chain cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) into a pseudo-gemini species by an interaction with di-or tricarboxylic acids (citric or maleic acid) [90]. The fluid possesses high viscosity (1000 PaÂ·s), strong viscoelasticity, and temperature and shear resistance. Such an approach eliminates the complex and expensive synthesis of oligomeric surfactants as cheap surfactants and acids may be used.

(p8.2) Therefore, the mixing of surfactants is an efficient way of obtaining viscoelastic networks of long WLMs with enhanced rheological performance. Promising approaches consist in using mixtures of single-chain and oligomeric surfactants or in the formation of "pseudo-oligomeric" surfactants.
