## (s18) Materials and methods
(p18.0) This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) list [13] and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registration number: CRD42023401152).The inclusion criteria were male or female patients aged ≥ 18 who underwent TKA.

(p18.1) The intervention groups comprised those who had undergone remote rehabilitation using the internet, smartphones, virtual reality or conference calls.The control groups received routine nursing and face-to-face rehabilitation therapy or were the blank control group.The primary outcome measures were pain, knee flexion and extension, timed up and go (TUG) test score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) and patient quality of life.The secondary outcome measures were adverse events, patient satisfaction and costs.The study type comprised systematic reviews of telerehabilitation in patients who underwent TKA with or without meta-analyses.The exclusion criteria comprised studies not published in English or Chinese, duplicate publications, conference abstracts, studies where the full text is unobtainable, studies mainly measuring the performance of applications and wearable devices and studies involving patients with other comorbidities in which TKA was not the main research topic.
## (s25) Reporting quality evaluation
(p25.0) Two researchers evaluated each study's quality using PRISMA [13], the preferred reporting method for determining items when assessing systematic reviews and meta-analyses.There were 27 items, including the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion and funding statements.The presence, partial presence or absence of each item was indicated by 'yes' , 'partially yes' and 'no' , with scores of 1, 0.5 and 0, respectively, with a total possible score of 27.A score of ≤ 15 was defined as a relatively severe information deficiency, 15-21 showed a certain reporting deficiency, and 21-27 indicated that the report was relatively complete.The results were checked after the evaluation, and discussions were held with a third person (fei wang)when the researchers disagreed.
## (s26) Risk of bias assessment
(p26.0) The risk of bias was assessed by two researchers using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) scale [15], which consists of three stages.The first stage assessed the correlations (selected based on the situation).The second stage determined the risk of bias in the process of systematic review production in terms of four areas: the inclusion criteria, search and screening, data extraction and quality assessment and data synthesis and presentation of results, with a total of 21 items.The third stage determined the ROBIS as high risk, low risk or uncertain.Using ROBIS, we checked the results following this evaluation, and any disagreements were discussed with a third person(fei wang).
