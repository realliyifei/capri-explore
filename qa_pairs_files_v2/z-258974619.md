## (s15) Treelet Transform
(p15.0) A composite of hierarchical CA and traditional PCA, treelet transform [72] provides an improvement over traditional PCA and an important contribution to clustering methodology.For clustering methodology, it provides a framework which actively searches for the correct underlying correlation structure of the data.Its improvement over PCA happens especially when the correlation matrix is believed to be sparse, as in the analysis of dietary patterns, and is generally worth note [123].
## (s24) Gwhere
(p24.0) ip ∼ Bern(υ (s) p ), υ(s)  p ∼ Bern(1, β(s) ),β (s) ∼ Γ(a, b),with the hyperparameters (a, b) used for varying the overall weight of each local component (deviated food item) of its corresponding subpopulation.For the global clustering process, the RPC adopts an overfitted finite mixture model[125], with an upper bound equal to 50 for the number of clusters K:P r(Ci = h) = π h , π • = (π 1 , . . ., π K ) ∼ Dir1 Dir indicates a Dirichlet distribution.The RPC replicates this scheme to specify the model for the local clustering: P r(L ip = l|s i = s) = λ
