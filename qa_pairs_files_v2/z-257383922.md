## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Mycotoxins consumed by food-producing animals with their feed can be transferred into their tissues and occur in foods made of them for human consumption, e.g., in milk consumed daily. Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of great concern, with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) produced by fungi on certain crops and converted into its metabolite aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) when ingested by cows with feed. AFB1 and AFM1 are both toxic and carcinogenic compounds.

(p0.1) Quantification of this transfer (carry-over) provides information about the relationship of the levels of contamination in feed and the resulting contamination in milk. Several studies have been published in the last few decades to determine the carry-over of aflatoxins from feed to milk. This transfer can be described, on the one hand, by the so-called bioconcentration factor (BF), showing AFM1 concentration in milk as a percentage of the AFB1 concentration in feed (1).
