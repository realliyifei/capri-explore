## (s7) Conclusion
(p7.0) TNBS induced colitis is a commonly utilized animal model that shares significant properties with human Crohn's disease. The advantages of its use include the reproducibility, the technical simplicity and the low cost [25]. The model is applicable in both rodents and guinea pigs with significant strain-dependent differences. Collectively, despite the introduction of genetic and spontaneous models that mimic Crohn's disease, TNBS-colitis remains a potent tool in our armamentorium to study immunopathogenesis and potential treatments of the disease. Of note, the model has several inherent limitations and does not recapitulate the disease in terms of aetiopathogenesis. Being aware of the model's limitations will enable researchers to properly use the model. More research is warranted to shed light on the exact mechanisms that underlie its pathogenesis and specifically the role of gut microbiota.
