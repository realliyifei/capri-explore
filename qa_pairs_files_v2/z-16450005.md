## (s1) Non-structure of the clone lattice
(p1.0) The size 2 2 |X| of Cl(X), the fact that it contains copies of all clone lattices over finite sets as intervals, and several "non-structure results" that will be discussed later in this survey have long indicated that the clone lattice is complicated, and that there is no hope of describing it completely. Recently, it has been shown that the clone lattice is in some sense the most complicated algebraic lattice of its size.

(p1.1) Theorem 1 (Pinsker [Pin07]). Let L be an algebraic lattice which has not more than 2 |X| compact elements. Then Cl(X) contains a copy of L as a complete sublattice.
