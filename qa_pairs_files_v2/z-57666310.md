## (s16) Model inputs and outputs
(p16.0) The most common input parameters in the TK models reported in the inventory are physiological parameters (e.g. body weight, organ weight, blood flow, organ and tissue volumes, blood flow to organs) that are non-dependent on the nanoform. Only one model in the inventory has a size-related input parameter (diameter) [22] that is applied in the calculation of the MPS uptake rate of MNs from blood circulation. Other physicochemical properties such as surface area, specific surface area, density and agglomeration state are not extensively considered as input parameters in the collected models. These physicochemical properties are well known to affect the TK of MNs. However, most available TK models were developed and parameterised on the basis of experimental data for a single MN, and their goal was not to predict TK for other MNs. As other computational kinetic models, the estimation of the concentration in tissues, time-dependent concentration in organs or other specific compartments is the main predicted model outcome of the collected TK models.
