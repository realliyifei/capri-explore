## (s19) FCN
(p19.0) Full convolution neural network (FCN) is the basis of image semantics segmentation. At present, almost all semantics segmentation models are based on FCN. FCN first extracts and codes the features of the input image using convolution, then gradually restores the feature image to the size of the input image by deconvolution or up sampling. Based on the differences in FCN network structure, the plant diseases and pests segmentation methods can be divided into conventional FCN, U-net [76] and SegNet [77].
## (s20) Mask R-CNN
(p20.0) Mask R-CNN is one of the most commonly used image instance segmentation methods at present. It can be considered as a multitask learning method based on detection and segmentation network. When multiple lesions of the same type have adhesion or overlap, instance segmentation can separate individual lesions and further count the number of lesions. However, semantic segmentation often treats multiple lesions of the same type as a whole. Stewart et al. [82] trained a Mask R-CNN model to segment maize northern leaf blight (NLB) lesions in an unmanned aerial vehicle image. The trained model can accurately detect and segment a single lesion. At the IOU threshold of 0.50, the IOU between the baseline true value and the predicted lesion was 0.73, and the average accuracy was 0.96. Also, some studies combine the Mask R-CNN framework with object detection networks for plant diseases and pests detection. Wang et al. [83] used two different models, Faster R-CNN and ask R-CNN, in which Faster R-CNN was used to identify the class of tomato diseases and Mask R-CNN was used to detect and segment the location and shape of the infected area. The results showed that the proposed model can quickly and accurately identify 11 class of tomato diseases, and divide the location and shape of infected areas. Mask R-CNN reached a high detection rate of 99.64% for all class of tomato diseases. Compared with the classification and detection network methods, the segmentation method has advantages in obtaining the lesion information. However, like the detection network, it requires a lot of annotation data, and its annotation information is pixel by pixel, which often takes a lot of effort and cost.

## (s32) Fine-grained identification
(p32.0) First, there is a large difference within the class, that is, the visual characteristics of plant diseases and pests belonging to the same class are quite different. The reason is that the aforementioned external factors such as uneven illumination, dense occlusion, blurred equipment dithering and other interferences, resulting in different image samples belonging to the same kind of diseases and pests differ greatly. Plant diseases and pests detection in complex scenarios is a very challenging task of finegrained recognition [101]. The existence of growth variations of diseases and pests results in distinct differences in the characterization of the same diseases and pests at different stages, forming the "intra-class difference" finegrained characteristics.
## (s35) Occlusion problem
(p35.0) At present, most researchers intentionally avoid the recognition of plant diseases and pests in complex environments. They only focus on a single background. They use the method of directly intercepting the area of interest to the collected images, but seldom consider the occlusion problem. As a result, the recognition accuracy under occlusion is low and the practicability is greatly reduced. Occlusion problems are common in real natural environments, including blade occlusion caused by changes in blade posture, branch occlusion, light occlusion caused by external lighting, and mixed occlusion caused by different types of occlusion. The difficulties of plant diseases and pests identification under occlusion are the lack of features and noise overlap caused by occlusion. Different occlusion conditions have different degrees of impact on the recognition algorithm, resulting in false detection or even missed detection. In recent years, with the maturity of deep learning algorithms under restricted conditions, some researchers have gradually challenged the identification of plant diseases and pests under occluded conditions [106,107], and significant progress has been made, which lays a good foundation for the application of plant diseases and pests identification in real-world scenarios. However, occlusion is random and complex. The training of the basic framework is difficult and the dependence on the performance of hardware devices still exists, we should strengthen the innovation and optimization of the basic framework, including the design of lightweight network architecture. The exploration of GAN and other aspects should be enhanced, while ensuring the accuracy of detection, the difficulty of model training should be reduced. GAN has prominent advantages in dealing with posture changes and chaotic background, but its design is not yet mature, and it is easy to crash in learning and cause model uncontrollable problems during training. We should strengthen the exploration of network performance to make it easier to quantify the quality of the model.
