## (s9) Indeterminate phase
(p9.0) The chronically infected individual remains a life-long source of the parasite as an indeterminate phase reservoir.Approximately one third of all individuals with indeterminate infections will develop chronic Chagas disease.The indeterminate phase of infection has been defined based on criteria of (i) positive specific IgG antibody test and/or parasitological demonstration; (ii) absence of symptoms and signs of Chagas disease; (iii) absence of ECG abnormalities; (iv) regular size of heart, esophagus and colon by X-ray.Using these criteria, regardless of the geographic area where field studies have been conducted, it has been estimated that two thirds of T. cruzi-infected individuals will remain in this condition during their economically-productive lives.Thus most patients with indeterminate infections are 20 to 50 years of age, comprising approximately 12 million people with positive immunologic tests for the parasite.Their life span is similar to that observed for the general population (Macedo 1999).Usually indeterminate phase individuals are identified as such during job application or blood bank screening.Denial of work is unjustified, but the candidate is disqualified from blood donation.
## (s11) Digestive form of Chagas disease
(p11.0) Gastrointestinal disorders are among the most common clinical manifestations of chronic Chagas disease.A clinical study aimed at the evaluation of autonomic function in chagasic patients showed esophageal alterations usually occurred earlier in the course of the chronic infections when compared to similar abnormalities in the heart (reviewed in Macedo 1999).A digestive disease patient may complain of difficulty swallowing and regurgitation of food, clinical symptoms related to megaesophagous.Alternatively, some complain of constipation due to a fecal bolus in the rectal ampoule as a result of megacolon.Megaesophagous and megacolon are seen frequently in endemic areas; patients showing these conditions bear specific antibodies to T. cruzi and consistently positive nucleic acid tests (NAT) assays.These 'mega' conditions can affect individual patients independently, in association with each other or in association with heart disease.

(p11.1) Megaesophagus can manifest clinically in chagasics as early as 2 years of age or any time throughout life, although the majority of cases are seen in men between 20 and 40 years old.Megaesophagus anticipates heart trouble in many patients.The disease manifests by dysphagia, heartburn, hiccups, regurgitation of food, and increasing salivation.This clinical picture associates chagasics megaesophagus and caquexis resulting from difficulty to eat.The disease appears to evolve during periods of dysphagia followed by long periods during which symptoms are absent.

(p11.2) Megacolon is seen considerably later in the course of Chagas disease in comparison with megaesophagus.The main symptom of chagasic megacolon is constipation.The progressive retention of hardened bolus leads to dilation and thickening of the walls of the colon, usually compromising the sigmoid colon and rectum.Difficulty with passing of bolus leads to dilation of the remaining intestines, increasing bowel movements, pain, and constant physical distress.The long-term use of laxatives can cause ulcerations of mucosal surfaces, septicemia, rupture of the wall of the intestine and peritonitis.Typical complications of megacolon are intestinal obstruction and rupture (reviewed in Prata 1999).
