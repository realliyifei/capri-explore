## (s1) Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms
(p1.0) The implementation of cryptography has helped different information forms for being legally accessed via an authentic user with the assist of its typical processes of encryption.But, there are several differences when implementing encryption on ordinary files and on digital images [11].The pixels' contents inside any digital image are infinite and so, the encryption algorithm relies on the sampling process as well.Recently, there are lots of developed researches that have concentrated on image encryption, however, until now there is no standard algorithm of encryption that provides full coverage of security standards (privacy, availability, integrity, confidentiality, etc.).The best algorithm of image encryption refers to the encrypted image that has a low correlation with the original image i.e. high imperceptibility for the encrypted image.
