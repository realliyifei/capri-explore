## (s1) Anti-oxidative effects
(p1.0) Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between oxidative and antioxidative processes in vivo (Sies, 2015).The overproduction of ROS and the release of a range of transcription factors that regulate oxidative stress are essential in triggering oxidative responses in ischemic cardiomyocytes (Kurian et al., 2016).
## (s3) Anti-inflammation
(p3.0) During cardiac ischemia, a large number of pro-inflammatory factors are released, causing the adhesion and migration of neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells, which eventually accumulate around myocardial tissue to release lysosomal enzymes, causing damage to myocardial cells and becoming a key factor inducing cardiac I/R injury (Qiu et al., 2018).
## (s6) Reduction of calcium overload
(p6.0) During MIRI, calcium overload can cause the generation and release of downstream active factors, induce harmful reactions in cells, and interact with inflammation, oxidative stress, and other mechanisms to cause or aggravate myocardial cell injury (Soares et al., 2019).
