## (s5) Antioxidant activity
(p5.0) The total level of antioxidant activity was higher in Crude Nerium oleander leaves extract (72.8%), as compared to flower (68%) and Superoxide radical whereas scavenging activity was higher in Crude flower extract (66%) as compared to leaves 25%. Nerium oleander possesses an effective antioxidant activity, which includes free radical scavenging and reducing power and the antioxidant activity was correlated with the amount of the total phenolic content present in the respective extracts in each assay [15]. The leaf, stem and root extracts of N. Oleander is an effective free radical scavenger and might be used as a natural source of potent antioxidant.
