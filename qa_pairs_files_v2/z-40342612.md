## (s4) IMAGING DURING (CHEMO) RADIOTHERAPY
(p4.0) Measurable anatomic changes occur during the course of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, mainly during the second half of the treatment. Such volumetric and geometric changes can have a potential dosimetric impact when conformal treatment techniques are applied. Compared to pre-treatment CT, the per-treatment tumor volume appeared significantly smaller on MRI than on CT. Per-treatment automatic segmentation of tumor volume on FDG-PET is not possible due to tremendous increase in background signal by radiation-induced inflammation (Robert, 2006).
