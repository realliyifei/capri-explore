## (s5) Current limitation
(p5.0) The preceding arguments underscore the importance of developing a better understanding of neurological disorders to develop pharmacological targets or evaluate therapeutic agents crossing the BBB. Therefore, comprehensive in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies should be conducted. In general, observations from animal and clinical experiments provide critical information on the physiology and pathophysiology of the BBB. However, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms is a significant challenge in these experiments. Although animal experimentation yields valuable results, ethical concerns have recently gained attention [44], and further incompatibilities between human and animal genomes cause several drug failures [45]. Consideration is given to the length of the experiment. On average, animal testing takes several months to a year, as do operational and consumable expenditures. Human in vitro BBB models are considered ideal for addressing limitations in animal investigations but require engineering methodologies that are both precise and cost-effective. Consequently, a strategic model that ensures physiological property similarity, cost-effectiveness, and operational speed is necessary.
## (s26) Concluding remarks and perspectives
(p26.0) As advances described above, the human BBB is a unique vascular barrier formed by microvascular NVU cells lining the cerebral capillaries that regulate the transport of molecules into brain tissues. Mini-BBB models are artificial frameworks that mimic the human BBB for culture systems that can open up a new avenue for investigating neurological pathways and evaluating the effectiveness of biopharmaceuticals and medicines [183]. Human mini-BBB models that replicate CNS systems in combination with human cells and ECM components create a more relevant milieu, resulting in more meaningful results. The pathophysiological properties of mini-BBB models are becoming more apparent at the molecular and cellular levels, indicating potential biomarkers for drug developers. Second, mini-BBB models with structural modifications represent the native BBB genotype and phenotype. Therefore, the direct assessment of medicinal drug penetration using human BBB models is believed to be more efficient than in vivo models because it elucidates the transport mechanism. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, novel medicines must undergo a thorough toxicological assessment to guarantee their safety and cellular response. The next generation of medicines will be achieved shortly using a human cell model similar to the patient model. Although current versions of the human mini-BBB have shown considerable promise for broad use, certain limitations prevent them from serving as a substitute for in vivo models. The primary challenge is that the human BBB is a complex system with numerous hidden mechanisms that current technologies cannot fully illuminate. In contrast, the human BBB model is a simplified model that cannot fully enumerate the complex aspects of physiopathology, frequently necessitating confirmation using animal models. The secondary challenge is researching neurological diseases, toxicity, and medication response, which requires a long time to verify cell-to-cell interactions and guarantee the safety of novel therapeutic agents, while published human BBB models only survive for a few days. Owing to these challenges, further research on complex long-term BBB models in vitro is needed. Although a complexity model is required, a suitable model for the intended application must be developed because complexity models are related to cost-effectiveness, operation control, and throughput. Integrating the BBB with additional cell types linked to disease scenarios may enhance the complexity of the BBB system. For instance, investigations of the BBB reaction to external stimuli require a simple BBB monolayer, whereas brain cancer development requires a sophisticated microvascular network system. As a result, the protocol and validation process must be tailored to the applications in question.

(p26.1) In addition, the advancement of the human brain model has expanded the possibilities for creating medicines, particularly CNS therapeutic agents. Recent advances in artificial human brain models have brought them closer to the microarchitecture of brain physiopathogenesis, serving as a potential tool for neurological research in neurodegenerative diseases and establishing them as attractive tools for basic drug discovery research. By gaining a better understanding of BBB physiopathology, the development of neuropharmacological drugs will become more accessible. Additionally, rebuilding the brain microvasculature and microvascular environments will be simpler than ever to undertake pathophysiological brain research, medication screening for delivery, toxicological analysis, and personalized medicine by providing easy tools and replacing animal studies.

(p26.2) In this review, we primarily address the present state and difficulties of mini-brain models for fundamental neuroscience research, neurodegenerative diseases, and neurological drug delivery. Although artificial mini-brain models have attained many physiopathological characteristics, they require further technical development to obtain native human BBB and brain properties. Thus, advancements in brain tissue engineering, biomaterial engineering, and microengineering are being made devoid of animal components for humans that are physiologically relevant under a micro-scalable controlled design. The discussion in this article will illuminate several alternative strategies for creating human BBB models. Numerous BBB models have been discussed in this review, and it is conceivable to connect them with other organs, such as the intestine for the gut-brain axis or the respiratory system, to replicate neurological abnormalities induced by external causes.
