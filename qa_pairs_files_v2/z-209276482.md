## (s21) Feed intake data (FEEDAP Panel)
(p21.0) The approach adopted by the FEEDAP Panel to estimate animal dietary exposure to feed additives from default values for body weight and daily feed intake is reported for the main categories of farmed and companion animals in the Guidance on the assessment of the safety of feed additives for the target species (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2017). This guidance recommends these default values for the main animal species/categories at specific growth rates or level of productivity and physiological status which are representative of the most sensitive phases of the production cycles (Table 3).
