## (s4) Hepatitis Virus Infection
(p4.0) Hepatitis viruses are well-known risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and worldwide approximately 56% and 20% of HCC cases are related to HBV and HCV infections, respectively [35]. Recent studies suggest that both HBV and HCV may also represent risk factors for CCA, particularly iCCA [36]. It seems that differences in HBV-and HCV-related CCA risk exist between Asian and Western populations. Indeed, while HBV infection represents a risk factor for CCA in some Asian countries such as China, where it is highly endemic, HCV-related CCAs mostly occur in Western countries and the United States [36]. The molecular mechanisms of HBV-and HCV-related CCA carcinogenesis still remain poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized that they may be similar to those driving HCC carcinogenesis, including a status of chronic inflammation due to the continuous presence of the virus in target tissues, and insertional mutagenesis in host cells of viral DNA, which can directly promote malignant transformation [37]. In HCC carcinogenesis, HBV-DNA insertion is an early event after viral infection and results in DNA damage and genomic instability in infected cells; furthermore, the integration sites of HBV-DNA are not random, but target specific loci of the tumor genome [38].
