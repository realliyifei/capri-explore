## (s12) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
(p12.0) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a member of the gammaherpesviruses subfamily. It is a ubiquitous virus acquired by most people by young adulthood. The virus is transmitted by saliva and infects epithelial cells and B cells of the oropharynx, causing a predominantly lytic infection in the former while establishing latency in the latter [102].
