## (s19) Studies with analysis based on renal function
(p19.0) The main characteristics of the only study that reported efficacy data based on renal function are presented in Table 1. The study was a post hoc subgroup analysis of two RCTs and their open-label extension study, including 211 patients with varying degrees of renal dysfunction [44]. The efficacy endpoint was an SU of <6 mg/dl for 80% of the time during months 3 and 6. Overall, there did not appear to be significant differences in efficacy based on renal function. Gout flare and infusion reactions were the most commonly reported adverse events, and there were no differences in the pegloticase safety profile according to renal function ( Table 2).
