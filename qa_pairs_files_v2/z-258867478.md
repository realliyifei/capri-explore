## (s3) MBI and cognitive function correlation
(p3.0) To better assess the role of MBI and its domains in preclinical AD, existing NPI data can be used. A retrospective study of psychiatric outpatients using the NPI for the diagnosis of MBI found that the hazard ratio (HR) for dementia was higher for MBI than other psychiatric diseases (HR = 8.07, 95% CI: 4.34-15.03, p < 0.001), and those with affective disorders had an increased risk of developing dementia among MCI patients (HR = 1.646) (28). This result is interesting in that we can see that MBI predicts a higher risk of dementia, and the predictive power seems to be different for different MBI domains, which informs the subsequent predictive power of dementia risk for individual MBI domains. Of course, the study has limitations, such as the follow-up time of some subjects was insufficient (minimum 1 month) and the retrospective study design may have some insufficient information.
