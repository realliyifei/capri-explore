## (s16) State-of-the-Art Classification Techniques
(p16.0) Plant species classification can be carried out by botanists easily, but computer-assisted systems cannot do so as easily. Consequently, plants are classified through leaf shape, vein, color and the texture of the leaves. Plant species are classified through different classifiers. A classifier requires two sets of data, a training set and a test set, but does not consider class relationships and the illumination invariance and positional invariance of images. Certain authors use manifold learning for classification since it preserves local neighbourhood structure, and high dimensional data is mapped into a low-dimensional structure. It also considers all illumination and positional challenges and processes noisy images. Compared to linear and supervised classifiers, manifold learning offers a good accuracy on plant species identification (Fig. 4). 6
