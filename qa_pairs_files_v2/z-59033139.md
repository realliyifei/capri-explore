## (s4) Classification and analysis
(p4.0) Following the screening and selection process, articles were then categorised according to either root causes of poor immunisation data or interventions that improved data quality.Within these two categories, classification of articles was based on previously researched conceptual frameworks.Lippeveld et al. [12] theorise that a health information system (HIS) is comprised of the information process and management structures [12].Building on this framework, Aqil et al. [13] Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) incorporates technical, organizational and behavioural factors as key determinants in the processes, outputs and outcomes of health information systems [13].A combined approach was employed using these existing theories to then guide the classification of articles.For identifying root causes, the following groupings were used: "governance", "programme management" and "HR capacity and practices".Governance consists of both policies and the HIS structure, reflective of the PRISM's organisational factor.Additionally, HR capacity and practices involve the attitudes and skills of staff similar to the PRISM's behavioural factors.Finally, programme management is determined by a combination of behavioural and organisational factors since its performance is a function of HIS infrastructure and managers' competencies.Interventions were split into two groupings: "Health Information Systems/Information Communication Technology (ICT) Interventions" and "Programme Management Interventions".Interventions that modify HIS/ICT operations fell under all three of PRISM's factors because as technical factors are introduced, governance and workers' skills also must be altered.Articles were analysed and subsequently ranked according to the methodology, generalizability, representativeness and baseline review for interventions.Results show the strongest articles at the top (Tables 1  and 2).
