## (s2) The Complex Relationship between microRNAs and MYC Expression
(p2.0) The deregulation of the expression of several miRNAs can directly or indirectly lead to increased or decreased MYC, ( Table 2). As described above, MYC plays a key role in the normal and tumor development, and the MYC/miRNA network is likely to contribute to the oncogenic functions of MYC. In the present review, we highlight some miRNAs that are altered in GC and are associated with MYC activation. Up Up [114] Up, upregulated expression in gastric cancer in relation to control; Down, downregulated expression in gastric cancer in relation to control; ?: absence of studies on direct relationship between the respective microRNA and MYC in gastric cancer.
