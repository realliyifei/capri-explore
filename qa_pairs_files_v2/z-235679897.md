## (s9) Study Search and Selection Criteria
(p9.0) During the search strategy, eight electronic databases were selected to search for scientific articles. Figure 1 depicts the four steps based on the PRISMA statement [47] to select the studies, which were finally reviewed. After identifying articles using the various search procedures described above and removing duplicates, several sources included and excluded at each phase should be tabulated. One option for presenting information regarding thirty (n = 30) articles that met this review's inclusion criteria is illustrated in Figure 1. All articles were subject to first and second-round screening. As Table 2 shows, articles which did not meet the eligibility criteria were screened out in hierarchical order, depending on the type of article, study concept, and focus, and lastly on population and sample. When all articles were aggregated, the three authors discussed with consensus any possible disagreements in the selection of studies.
