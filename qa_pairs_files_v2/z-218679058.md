## (s7) Enterobacteriacee
(p7.0) The prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is increasing worldwide. Regarding the resistance determinants, SHV, TEM, OXA-1-like and CTX-M-gp1 were predominant enzymatic variants, whereas CTX-M-gp9, CTX-M-gp2, KPC, VIM, GES, OXA-48-like, NDM and OXA-23-like were considered emerging enzymes (84) Also, some association between several risk factors and ESBL-KP infection such as length of hospitalization, use of cephalosporins, use of quinolones, presence of a nasogastric tube, presence of an intravenous catheter, mechanical ventilation and cerebrospinal fluid drainage were found .
## (s9) Klebsiella pneumoniae
(p9.0) Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen and leading cause of HAIs infections. The main clones described were ST258, ST101, ST147, ST 48, ST 512, ST 15 and ST 14 (99,103-107). Some exceptions could be observed. In a multicentre prospective cohort study in Spain K. pneumoniae ST405 predominated (108,109). On November 2015, a KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreak occurred in a general hospital in South Korea due to a clonal spread of K. pneumoniae ST307 carrying a self-transferable IncX3type plasmid harboring bla KPC-2 . Sporadic emergence of K. pneumoniae ST697 and a ST11 isolate were observed (110).
