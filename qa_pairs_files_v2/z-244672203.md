## (s2) Integrin signalling
(p2.0) The integrins comprise a superfamily of cell adhesion receptors that recognize ECM and cell-surface ligands [15]. There are 18 α-subunits and 8 β-subunits that assemble to create 24 functionally distinct transmembrane heterodimers. Integrins are grouped according to their ligand-binding specificity: collagen-binding integrins (α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1), laminin-binding integrins (α3β1, α6β1, α7β1, and α6β4), leukocyte-integrins (α4β1, α9β1, α4β7, αEβ7,αLβ2, αMβ2, αXβ2, and αDβ2) and arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-recognizing integrins (α5β1, α8β1, αVβ1, αVβ3, αVβ5, αVβ6, αVβ8, and αIIbβ3) [15] (Fig. 1a).
## (s7) Integrins as therapeutic targets for EOC
(p7.0) Novel therapies that focus on malignant cells and their interactions with the tumor microenvironment in EOC have gained substantial interest due to the complexity of this disease. As described in detail above, integrins are key regulators at various steps in the unique metastatic cascade of EOC, particularly during the process of spheroid formation during transit, and for peritoneal invasion where integrin-ECM interactions are essential during spheroid adhesion and invasion [36].
