## (s7) Strategy adopted for literature search
(p7.0) Based on Moher et al. [53] description of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, information on the review was generated from prominent databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, BioMed Central, JSTOR, African Plant, New York Botanical Garden, Brazilian Flora Online, Global Biodiversity Information), journals, books, and/or chapters, thesis, dissertations, and conference proceedings, when Daniellia oliveri was cross-referenced with terminologies such as medicinal plants, indigenous uses, ethnoveterinary potentials, phytochemistry, bioactive compounds, secondary metabolites, pharmacological effects, biological properties, toxicity or side effects, quality control, and nutritional benefits between 1994 and 2023, resulting in a total number of 121 scientific documents out of 134 downloaded or identified records.documents and remove (where necessary) duplicated information and those that do not align with the scope of the review.
## (s21) Neurological
(p21.0) The neurological effect of the root part of the plant was investigated by Beppe et al. [14] in in vivo technique.The aqueous root extract at 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg b.w. was evaluated on diazepam-induced amnesia in Swiss albino mice during the 14-day experimental period.The learning and memory of the animals evaluated using the radial arm maze and T-maze established 200 mg/kg b.w. to most efficiently increase the preferred arm compared with the dementia group; the positive effect was also shared by piracetam (150 mg/kg b.w.).Additionally, the increased number of returns of the arm as a result of the diazepam induction was brought down by the doses of the extract.Increased MDA content was reversed significantly (p < 0.001) with 100 mg/kg b.w.while the reduced glutathione concentration was enhanced significantly (p < 0.001) by the doses of the extract especially the 200 mg/kg b.w.The histopathological observation of the hippocampus revealed the presence of abnormal architecture (granular cell at the dentate gyrus) with evidence of cell degeneration in the diazepam without treatment group; however, these aberrations were reversed with 300 mg/kg b.w.indicating the neuroprotective action of the plant.For the purpose of conservation, it will be appropriate that the aerial parts (leaves and stem bark) be evaluated for neurological potential and the likely compounds responsible for the activity be determined for possible drug development.
## (s26) Discussion
(p26.0) Medicinal plant usage in the treatment and or management of diseases is an age-long tradition.Indigenous medicine is now in recent times recognized within the national healthcare system or policy of most countries [113].The effectiveness of herbal medicine on these illnesses is attributed to the richness in the arrays of embedded secondary metabolites and or compounds.Interestingly, D. oliveri is not an exception as various parts (leaves, stem, and roots) of the plants possessed several secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, alkaloids, saponins peculiar to most West African countries (Mali, Nigeria, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire and Togo) where studies on the plant have been attributed to numerous established pharmacological potentials including antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antiwrinkle, antimalarial, antimelanogenesis, antidiarrhoea, antisickling, hepatoprotective, cytotoxic and safety potentials.In fact, typical of some of these compounds isolated from this plant are rutin and quercetin reported or known from the literature to exhibit peculiar pharmacological potentials not limited to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer (quercetin) [114] as well as antioxidant, antiviral, anticancer, neuroprotective, cardioprotective (rutin) [115].Although, it suffices to mention that variation existed in the presence or detection of some other compounds such as terpenes, sterols, glycosides, carbohydrates, and reducing sugars in the same part of the plants going by findings submitted by authors from these countries.The differences in compound classes as observed and summarized in this review are not surprising as such variations are attributed to differences in geographical locations whether in the soil type, weather condition, state of maturity, harvest time, and so on.While the review establishes and applauds the huge number of phytoconstituents obtained from various extracts/fractions of the plant (and its parts) as determined through a few analytical methods from different regions, however, the lack of further purification of the fractions to be able to identify bioactive compounds is a gap that requires to be investigated from the established biological and pharmacological potentials and/or applications.

(p26.1) Notwithstanding the fact that the review found the predominant use of water and polar solvents such as ethanol and methanol (alcohol) as the most suitable medium for extraction in indigenous medicine [116] while the stem bark was the majorly explored part of the plant for extract formulation accounting for 47% followed by the leaves with 35%.The leaf part would have been expected to reveal the highest usage percentage from an ethnobotanical point of view based on the clamour for its use to encourage biodiversity, however, this report identifies and buttressed the wide choice of the stem (bark) part for many ailments by the indigenous people and/or medicinal plant users of West Africa.The reason for this could be partly because the part is greatly explored for other purposes such as firewood and as repellent for mosquitoes.

(p26.2) In an effort towards drug development, preliminary assays such as in vitro and in vivo evaluations, as well as toxicity studies, are important to be carried out as a way of partly confirming the indigenous usage and to guide decision-making on further studies such as preclinical and clinical trials.Literature reports established that to a larger extent, the plant was well studied in vitro and in vivo (to a smaller extent) against a number of diseases accounting for 52% and 37% respectively of the overall reported experimental models.The below-average percentage in animal-model reports may signify that a number of these established pharmacological effects needed to be confirmed in vivo.Toxicity evaluation accounted for 11% of the total reported investigations and no clinical study report on the plant at the time of compiling this review was established, hence, above all, it would be encouraged that more focus and or efforts on in vivo, preclinical in vivo, and translational experimental designs or studies centering on 'omics' (metabolomics, proteomics, genomics, and transcriptomics) applications and concept are required to be put forward on the plant which would serve as a template or preliminary basis for further studies such as clinical trials towards developing novel drugs since it is a known fact that findings from in vitro evaluation may not necessarily translate into in vivo outcomes.Although, while no clinical trial studies were found in the literature with respect to this plant, clinical relevance of medicinal plants generally has continued to increase based on their acceptance and usage by (conventional) physicians and/or pharmacists in the management of different diseases, thus, playing a pivotal role in the elongation of human life [117] Interestingly, D. oliveri is not an exception to this concept.Besides, the various pharmacological and safety attributes established on this plant in both in vitro and in vivo testing are indications of likely positive feedback or sign of successful outcomes by the time the plant is eventually subjected to clinical trials.

(p26.3) Deductions from the review also indicated that more than 95% of the studies took place in West Africa with Nigeria recording the highest percentage.While the reason for this could be due to the wide distribution of the plant across this region of the globe, it may also points to the fact that the plant had not been adequately explored or is still underutilized which is concerning, and until this is achieved globally, the full therapeutic potentials may not be realized or attained.Hence, though considerable pharmacological potentials of the plant particularly in in vitro evaluations have been established and laudable, the review identified the need for the reported activities to be replicated in other continents of the world so as to give a thorough insight into the effectiveness of the plant on many disease conditions across wider populations and cultures.Similarly, across the board, validation of in vitro investigation in animal models as well as in clinical trials are necessary.Above all, it can be concluded that despite the fact that the review was able to establish numerous nutritional and pharmacological benefits of the plant attributed to various chemical and bioactive components; thus providing insights into likely development of probable natural moieties against a number of diseases, it is still evident that much research undertakings are needed on the identified grey areas (for the afore-mentioned to be achieved) in order for the multitherapeutic effect of the plant to be maximally explored.
