## (s18) Additional exploratory analyses
(p18.0) In addition to controlling for author gender in our meta-analytic models (see above), we also examined whether author gender would moderate the extent to which a study would report gender bias on the part of prospective employers.However, author gender did not influence the amount of gender discrimination reported across all studies and years (-0.06,z = 0.60, p =.549).

(p18.1) In addition to categorizing jobs into female-typed, male-typed, and gender-balanced jobs, we also examined additional job grouping variables.First, we examined whether gender discrimination would vary as a function of whether a job requires physical strength (0 = no, 1 = yes; rated by four human coders; Fleiss kappa = 0.76, p <.001).Results suggest that job physicality significantly moderated the effect of gender on callbacks (0.26, z = 2.08, p =.038), such that the average odds of a male (vs.female) applicant to receive a callback was significantly higher for physical jobs (odds ratio: 1.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.92, 1.49) compared to non-physical jobs (odds ratio: 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.85, 0.96).However, note that the proportion of jobs that require physical strength (4.92%) is small in the present sample and should thus be seen as a tentative result requiring confirmatory tests involving larger samples of jobs.Second, we explored whether gender discrimination varied as a function of whether a job required nurturance (0 = no, 1 = yes; rated by four human coders; Fleiss kappa = 0.74, p <.001).We found that job nurturance did not moderate the effect of gender on callbacks (0.09, z = 0.85, p =.394).Similar to job physicality, the proportion of jobs that require nurturance (6.97%) is small, rendering any conclusions tentative.Effect sizes are grouped together depending on the year the applications were sent out and were combined using a univariate random-effects model.The top panel (Fig. 5A) shows the average odds ratio before 2009 and 2009 and thereafter, which corresponds to the theoretical crossover point of the time trend in Fig. 3.The bottom panel (Fig. 5B) compares the odds ratios using more granular time periods, including the post-#MeToo years of 2018-2020.Odds ratios above 1 indicate a greater preference for male applicants and odds ratios below 1 indicate greater preference for female applicants.Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval around the average odds ratio that is based on a normal distribution.The size of the symbols is proportional to the number of effect sizes in the respective bin.

(p18.2) Finally, we examined the potential influence of several country-level factors that could affect gender discrimination.First, in addition to including a country's gender inequality as a control variable, we tested whether the GII (described earlier) would moderate the present results; however, this was not the case (-0.713, z = 1.38, p =.168).Second, we examined whether a country's education level would affect the results, using the United Nation's Education Index (United Nations Development Programme, 2020).Similar to the GII, we matched the closest available Education Index value to each country and study year.However, education did not moderate the effect of applicant gender on discrimination (-0.291, z = 0.430, p =.667).Third, we tested whether gender discrimination may be influenced by economic prosperity, using GDP per capita data (log) retrieved from The World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/),but found no significant effect (-0.065, z = 0.716, p =.474).Fourth, we examined whether gender discrimination is influenced by the Human Development Index (HDI)-a summary measure of average achievement in human development, including longevity and standard of living among other factors (United Nations Development Programme, 2020).However, we found no significant moderating effect of HDI (0.036, z = 0.077, p =.939).Lastly, we examined whether culture would influence gender discrimination using the WEIRD index developed by Muthukrishna et al. (2020).However, we did not find any moderating effect (-1.465, z = 1.417, p =.157).
## (s22) Forecasters
(p22.0) The nationally representative sample of laypeople was recruited through Prolific Academic and included 499 participants with ages between 18 and 78 (mean 35).When asked for their gender, 248 selected 'female', 244 selected 'male', 6 selected 'other', and 1 did not respond.In terms of overall political views, 85 participants reported to be at least somewhat conservative, 95 reported to be in the 'middle of the road' and 318 reported to be at least somewhat liberal.The sample was designed to be as representative as possible of the U.S. population on the dimensions of age, sex, and ethnicity using census data from the U.S. Census Bureau.Although the Prolific sample reflects the general population of the United States on these dimensions, it is not nearly as ideologically diverse as would be ideal.A sample with more left-leaning than right-leaning Americans is typical of such onsite data collection sites (Levay, Freese, & Druckman, 2016).

(p22.1) Forecasters from the academic sample were recruited through social media, professional listservs, direct email, and doctoral seminars.In the academic sample (N = 312), the age of the participants ranged from 21 to 76 (mean 38).When asked for their gender, 116 participants selected 'female', 195 selected 'male', and 1 selected 'other'.Most academics reported being at least somewhat liberal in their overall political views (2 4 7), while 38 chose 'middle of the road' and 27 reported being at least somewhat conservative.The largest subgroups of academic forecasters were from the fields of psychology (139, including subfields such as social and clinical psychology), economics (64, including subfields such as behavioural economics) and management (41, including subfields such as organizational behaviour and marketing).Of the remaining 65 participants, 35 were distributed over 16 different fields, and 33 did not provide an academic field or responded with 'N/A'.Career stages included Assistant Professor (69), Associate Professor (57), Professor (63), Graduate Student (64), Postdoctoral Scholar ( 27), Teaching Faculty (12), Research Assistant (11), other academic position (6), and Professor Emeritus (1); two participants did not respond to this item.Forecasters were provided a copy of the draft empirical report in advance and asked if they would like to opt-in to consortium authorship and if so to provide their names and affiliations.Colleagues listed as members of the Gender Audits Forecasting Collaboration in the Appendix A both made forecasts and indicated they would like to be part of the consortium credit.Not all forecasters elected to be listed as consortium authors, thus the number of names in the Appendix A differs from the sample size for Study 2.
