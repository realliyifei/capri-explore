Diagnosis of HCC should be based on dynamic image studies (such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) and/or liver tumor biopsy, and the typical dynamic image of HCC shows intense arterial uptake followed by "washout" of contrast in the venous and/or delayed phases [18] . Even in liver tumors with elevated AFP, secondary malignancies still should be considered especially when the presentations of imaging studies are atypical, and liver tumor biopsy is recommended for differential diagnosis. In addition, risk factors such as liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C infection can usually be found among patients with HCC, but those risk factors may not be observed among patients with HAC. Once AFPproducing metastatic liver tumors are found, an intensive search for primary tumor origin should be initiated.
