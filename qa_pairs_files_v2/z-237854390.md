## (s9) Nanotechnology in the Textile Industry
(p9.0) Nanotechnology is utilized in cloth industry due to the expanded sturdiness of fabrics, comfortness, hygienic homes and decreased manufacturing cost. The pleasant homes of nanoparticles can provide excessive durability for handled fabrics as they possess large floor region and excessive floor energy that make certain better affinity for fabrics and led to an make bigger in sturdiness of the favored fabric function. The use of nanotechnology approves textiles to end up multifunctional and produce fabrics with distinct functions, inclusive of antibacterial, UV protection, convenient clean, water and stain repellent and antiodor [3].
