## (s2) Preparation of platelet-rich plasma
(p2.0) There is still no standardized method of preparation and application of PRP. PRP is produced through cell separation by centrifugation and then injected into androgen-dependent areas of the scalp. Multiple methods of preparation of PRP have been reported in the literature including commercial kits and manual methods using a laboratory centrifuge. Some devices include an accessory to reduce leukocyte count and increase platelet purity. Most preparations use either closed or semi-closed systems, which differ in their ability to concentrate platelets (Dhurat and Sukesh, 2014). This results in suspensions that contain different concentrations of platelets and leukocytes.
