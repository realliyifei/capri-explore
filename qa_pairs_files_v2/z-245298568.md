(p4.0) Finally, we conclude the article by highlighting some open challenges and future research directions in this field while putting a special emphasis on machine learning techniques for the detection and prevention of fraud in online ad systems.

(p4.1) Most of the previous research literature in this field (including [4,5]) have looked at the problem of advertising fraud in very generic ways, without explicitly identifying or naming the most likely fraud perpetrators and targets.The main novelty of this work is the fact that we focus on the categorization of ad fraud based on the main human actors (executors vs. victims).Furthermore, we provide illustrative real-world examples of different types of advertising fraud, thereby providing an important practical perspective that is very much missing in the current literature.Additionally, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing surveys that have identified the most important open challenges and future research directions in this field with a strong emphasis on the application of machine learning.

(p4.2) The remainder of this article is structured as follows.In Sections 2-6, we provide a general overview of the digital advertising ecosystem, while in Sections 7 and 8 we specifically focus on the topic of digital advertising fraud.In particular, in Section 2 we introduce the main elements of an online advertising ecosystem, the critical interactions among these elements, and various technologies involved in the delivery of the right ads to the right people at the right time.In Section 3, we specifically discuss different forms of digital advertising, and in Section 4 we describe two primary types of publisher-advertiser contract.In Section 5, we explain three most common types of revenue models used in digital advertising systems.In Section 6, we cover the concept of user tracking and profiling techniques as pertinent to digital advertising.Finally, in Section 7 we explore different types of fraud in the ad ecosystem, while in Section 8 we present a taxonomy of ad fraud prevention and detection methods.In Section 9, we outline the main conclusions of this study.
## (s18) Revenue Models in Digital Advertising Ecosystem
(p18.0) Advertisers are essentially companies with products to sell, and they invest money into buying online impressions hoping that these impressions will boost their profit.On the other side, publishers commit to displaying the advertisers' ads and, in return, will charge the advertisers a commission fee for the action(s) generated by the user.The amount of commission received by a publisher is called revenue [4].
