## (s2) Results
(p2.0) In April 2020, the research led to the detection of approximately 2000 articles (from 1980 to 2020), but in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles were enrolled in the present review. As the articles show detailed descriptions of surgical procedures to better clarify their singularities and effects, we grouped each article in accordance to which component of LPW is mostly involved and how deeply its modification occurs. As a result, we found four articles presenting surgical procedures in which SPC is manipulated and/or dissected, while in the remaining papers, PPM is the main structural target. In particular, five studies proposed a total or subtotal section of the muscle, four papers a partial section of the muscular fibers, and in four studies, minimal tissue handling is performed (Table 1, Figure 1).

(p2.1) Data on the efficacy and complications of LPW surgeries are shown in Table 1. The majority of samples included in the study consisted of patients affected by severe OSAS (mean pre-op apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 30). A mean reduction of more than 50% of AHI and a mean post-op AHI < 20 were observed in all series except one [10]. Some authors did not specify complications and their rates.
