## (s3) Receptors of β-glucan
(p3.0) The interaction between β-glucans and their receptors on human cells is likely to be very complex and only partially known. The main receptors that are involved in inflammatory and immune-response are Dectin-1, CR3, LacCer, NKp30 and scavenger receptors [9].
## (s6) NKp30
(p6.0) NKp30 belongs to immunoglobulin-like transmembrane receptor family and it was needed to bind 1-3 β-glucan by NK cells. It has been demonstrated that this receptor can activate Src family kinases and mediate granule polarization and perforin release in NK cells. In this sense, NKp30 has been recognized as a patternrecognition receptor, whose stimulation enhances NK cell killing of fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans [62].
