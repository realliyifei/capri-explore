## (s8) Multi-view feature analysis
(p8.0) Medical science witnesses everyday measurements from a series of medical examinations documented for each subject, including clinical, imaging, immunologic, serologic, and cognitive measures [50], as shown in Fig. 5. Each group of measures characterizes the health state of a subject from different aspects. This type of data is named as multi-view data, and each group of measures form a distinct view quantifying subjects in one specific feature space. Therefore, it is critical to combine them to improve the learning performance, while simply concatenating features from all views and transforming a multi-view data into a single-view data, as the method (a) shown in Fig. 6, would fail to leverage the underlying correlations between different views.
