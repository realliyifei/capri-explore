## (s6) Applications
(p6.0) The vegetation index (VI) is the integration of spectral data from two or more bands after a certain mathematical transformation [32]. Researchers usually establish mathematical prediction models by calculating the spectral value of the sensitive wavelength or by calculating and optimizing vegetation indices defined in botany.
## (s15) The principle of multispectral and hyperspectral imaging
(p15.0) The visible to long-wave infrared spectral spectrum (0.4-14 µm) is commonly used in scientific research. The electromagnetic waves in this band can be divided into four categories: VIS band (400-700 nm), NIR band (700-1000 nm), short-wave infrared band (1000-2500 nm) and long-wave infrared band (7.5-14 µm) [68].
## (s28) LiDAR scanning
(p28.0) Radar is an electronic device that transmits electromagnetic waves to the target and receives its echo, to obtain the distance and orientation from the target to the electromagnetic wave transmission point. LiDAR is a radar (radio detection and ranging) system that transmits a laser beam to detect the position, velocity and other characteristics of a target [124,125].

(p28.1) Radar is an electronic device that transmits electromagnetic waves to the target and receives its echo, to obtain the distance and orientation from the target to the electromagnetic wave transmission point. LiDAR is a radar (radio detection and ranging) system that transmits a laser beam to detect the position, velocity and other characteristics of a target [124,125].
## (s44) Applications
(p44.0) The vegetation index (VI) is the integration of spectral data from two or more bands after a certain mathematical transformation [32]. Researchers usually establish mathematical prediction models by calculating the spectral value of the sensitive wavelength or by calculating and optimizing vegetation indices defined in botany.
## (s53) The principle of multispectral and hyperspectral imaging
(p53.0) The visible to long-wave infrared spectral spectrum (0.4-14 µm) is commonly used in scientific research.
