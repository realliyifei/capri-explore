## (s5) Supply of veterinary pharmaceuticals to smallholder farmers
(p5.0) The availability, access and proper use of veterinary pharmaceuticals are critical for the success of veterinary interventions in the smallholder sector in Zimbabwe.However, smallholder farmers in Sub Saharan Africa, including Zimbabwe face significant challenges in accessing veterinary medicines (Jaime et al., 2022).Previously, smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe used to obtain veterinary drugs from Animal Health and Management Centres (AHMCs), but the hyperinflation and disbanding of the drug revolving fund system within the DVS have disrupted this supply chain (DVS, personal communication).As a result, farmers now have to travel to nearby towns or service centers, incurring high transport costs, to obtain the necessary drugs.

(p5.1) This scarcity of veterinary medicines has created opportunities for opportunistic individuals who take advantage of the unavailability of drugs and the lack of information by the farmers.As noted by Jaime et al., (2022), the supply of veterinary drugs in sub-Saharan Africa has been taken over by private non-professional actors.These individuals sometimes sell falsified, substandard, or improperly stored drugs, leading to improper use and potential risks to animal health and antimicrobial resistance.Farmers have reported purchasing veterinary drugs from roadside markets known as "baccosi,"
## (s6) Human health protection in the smallholder sector
(p6.0) In the smallholder sector, livestock is slaughtered for various purposes, including home consumption, sale, or as part of celebrations and ceremonies.However, the slaughtering practices often do not take place at registered hygienic slaughter facilities and are not subject to inspection (Prinsen et al, 2020).Additionally, there are instances where animals that have died from diseases or unknown causes are processed for human consumption.This situation presents a significant challenge in terms of zoonotic disease transmission, posing risks to human health.
