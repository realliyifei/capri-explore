## (s6) MRPL4 / TNF-α
(p6.0) Intracellular adhesion molecule type 1 gene is expressed in the respiratory epithelium and plays an important role in ocular sensitivities.The MRPL4 gene is located near 1-ICAM and at position p13.219 on the chromosome, and for this reason, it may be considered a risk factor for the occurrence of AR.Wei et al. [23] reported that the frequency of rs1799964 of the MRPL4 gene polymorphisms is significantly higher in people with NF-α allergic rhinitis than in healthy people.
## (s7) TNFSF4/ BLK
(p7.0) Recent studies indicate that the interaction between the type 4 tumor necrosis factor receptor gene and the B lymphocyte kinase gene can synergistically determine the direction of B and T cells.Shen et al. [24] studied rs1234314 and rs1234315 polymorphisms of the TNFSF4 gene and rs13277113 and rs1600249 polymorphisms of the BLK gene as effective biomarkers in allergic rhinitis susceptibility in the Chinese population.The results showed that the CC genotype (rs1234314 (r1234315) and the AA (rs1600249, 113277113) genotype have a protective effect against allergic rhinitis.At the same time, the AG (rs13277113) genotype was proposed as a risk factor in the occurrence of AR.It was also stated that the ACC haplotype in rs1234313 rs1234314 rs1234315 and GA in rs2254546 rs13277113 significantly reduce the risk of AR while GGT and AG haplotypes show a protective effect against AR.
