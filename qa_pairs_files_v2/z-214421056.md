## (s10) Selection of Included Studies
(p10.0) An overview of the selection of included studies is presented using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [38] diagram in Figure 1. The database search identified 1784 nonduplicated papers. The kappa statistic, a measure of inter-rater reliability, for the pilot screen was 0.72, meeting the above-defined threshold. Following the title and the abstract review, 229 papers were fully reviewed and assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This full-text screening was conducted independently by 2 authors (BL and JS). 
## (s16) Future Directions
(p16.0) This scoping review provides a preliminary insight into the role of analytics in evaluating mHealth apps for transition-aged youth and identifies both progress that has been made and future areas of exploration. Most importantly, this review adds to the sparse literature on analytics and highlights the need for researchers to assess and standardize how to integrate analytics into their evaluation plans [25]. The addition of more case studies on analytics may help to identify emergent patterns that help us understand how transition-aged youth decide to adopt a solution to address their needs [14].
