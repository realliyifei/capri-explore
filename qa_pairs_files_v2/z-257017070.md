## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Antibiotics have antibacterial, antiviral, and growth-promoting effects. Since the 1940s, antibiotics have been widely used in livestock and poultry production. Their effects of medical treatment, health care, and growth promotion have had a very beneficial impact on the development of animal husbandry (Yin et al., 2021;Murugaiyan et al., 2022). With the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for meat products increases greatly, which also prompts abuse antibiotics in the breeding process, resulting in antibiotic residues, and causing great harm to human health Yang et al., 2019; Lalou ckov a and Sk rivanov a, 2019). With the progress of science and technology and the improvement of people's safety awareness, the damage of antibiotics to human beings has become increasingly apparent. There are more and more calls to ban antibiotics. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued Notice 194 prohibiting the addition of antibiotics to feed from January 2020. Therefore, the development and utilization of new green residue-free feed additives have been paid more and more attention, and implementing a comprehensive antibiotic prohibition policy has been implemented.
