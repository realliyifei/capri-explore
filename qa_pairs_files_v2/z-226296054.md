## (s5) Antioxidative Effect
(p5.0) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced intracellularly act as subcellular messengers in signal transduction pathways or as a part of the cell defense mechanism [68]. However, their excessive production can result in damage of many molecules, including protein and lipid peroxidation, DNA strand breaks, and RNA modifications, which further generate intracellular oxidative stress. The alteration of intracellular homeostasis manifests with cell dysfunction, metabolic failure, and finally, cellular death induction. The intake of exogenous antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, phenolic compounds, and natural plant pigments, may support the antioxidative defense [69].
