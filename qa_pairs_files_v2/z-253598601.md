## (s10) Modern breeding and CWRs
(p10.0) There are now avenues to harness CWRs and overcome some of these barriers. For instance, wild-derived genes conferring desirable alleles can now be introduced through precise genome editing into elite backgrounds without the need for lengthy introgression regimes, bypassing the barriers of linkage drag and reduced fertility that so often complicate the use of CWRs (Bohra et al., 2021). These modern approaches, utilising the advances in genomics and genome editing, provide promising pathways to overcome long-standing challenges and push CWRs to the forefront of crop improvement. Table 3, included examples of successful application of CWRs for crop improvement via modern breeding approaches.
