## (s5) Neurodevelopment
(p5.0) Rosanoff proposed an association of schizophrenia with complications of pregnancy and delivery as early as 1934.According to these, the etiology of schizophrenia may involve pathologic processes, caused by both genetic and environmental factors, which begin before the brain approaches its adult anatomical state in adolescence 3 .

(p5.1) Several genes in the context of neurodevelopment have been studied, as we can see in the Table 1.However, only a few SNPs had nominal statistical association with the disease, whereas some have been connected with neuroimaging differences and cognitive function in both control and schizophrenia subjects.
