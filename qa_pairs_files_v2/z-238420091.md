## (s2) TOLAC -BETWEEN RISK AND BENEFITS
(p2.0) TOLAC is associated with a success rate ranging from 65% to 85% [12-14]. The rate of success depends on the previous indication for cesarean section (it is higher when the previous cesarean is done for malpresentation, gestational hypertension, or when the patient has a previous vaginal birth and may be lower when the cesarean is done for dystocia, diabetes, failure to progress or cephalopelvic disproportion) [15].
