## (s8) T1 mapping
(p8.0) Parametric mapping has allowed for additional CMR characterization of cardiac amyloid. Myocardial T1, which represents interstitial expansion that may be commonly related to myocardial edema or fibrosis, is also lengthened by the matrix expansion of myocardial amyloid deposition. The magnitude of T1 elevation is particularly large in CA, allowing for its distinction from other cardiomyopathies [59]. Importantly, so-called native T1 mapping provides a CMR mechanism to CA evaluation that does not require gadolinium contrast.
## (s10) Diffusion tensor MRI
(p10.0) Another non-contrast magnetic resonance technique that has emerged for the characterization of CA is diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). By tracking water diffusion through tissue, DT-MRI allows the evaluation of myocardial microstructure, quantifying fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and myocardial sheetlet orientation. Early studies have demonstrated that MD tracks well with ECV estimates across amyloid subtypes, but that diastolic sheetlet changes may differ between ATTR and AL [69]. Additional validation studies and standardization of clinical protocols are the next important steps for this promising technique.
