## (s7) Antenna for flexible and smart clothing
(p7.0) Coupling the textile antenna with the smart clothing is emerging in the recent years and it provides interesting solutions particularly where the replacement of batteries in wearable devices is impracticable. For electromagnetic energy harvesting applications, it developed a smart and stable fabric that was covered with a dual band textile antenna. This antenna was designed to operate at both the mobile communication (GSM) 900 and digital cellular system (DCS) 1800 bands. Seven separate prototypes were created by using the following two distinct production processes: thermal adhesive lamination and embroidery. In a vacuum table, the antennas are cemented together using an ironing technique that involves steam [22].
