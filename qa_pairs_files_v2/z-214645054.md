(p14.0) Compared to solid ground, friction on the water surface is much smaller and mobility is much higher, thus suggesting a slippery and unstable interface. On this interface, it is more difficult to keep balance or generate thrust. Additionally, predators generally come from above or from the lateral side on land, but on the water surface, predators can also attack from underneath (Armis√©n et al., 2015), demanding much higher jumping ability. We thus propose two directions that could be of interest to researchers in the field of biology and biomechanics. Fluidity of water: The water environment on which water striders live may have different parameters such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, salinity, and fluidity. From a biomechanical perspective, the first four parameters can have a potential influence on surface tension, whereas the last one may affect locomotion traits. However, surface tension and CA vary little with the first four parameters in the natural environment. As a result, we could rule out the influence of the first four parameters and focus on the fluidity of water.
