## (s5) BENZALKONIUM CHLORIDE MECHANISM OF ACTION
(p5.0) Similar to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, benzalkonium chloride (BC), the primary ingredient of NABHS, is generally not effective against nonenveloped viruses, 16,17 though a study demonstrating its efficacy against the nonenveloped human coxsackie virus suggest exceptions exist. 18 Despite this exception, it appears that the lipid envelope of either bacteria or viruses are critical structures for BC's effectiveness.
