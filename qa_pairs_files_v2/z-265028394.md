## (s2) Search strategy
(p2.0) The first part consists of substages such as Identification and Inclusion.The identification part includes preprocessing the search for corresponding publications using established keywords in a limited period.This helps determine the growing interest in dementia in machine learning and narrow the circle of results of interest.After analyzing the results of the first substage, it is possible to identify the top five keywords to continue the process in the substage "Inclusion".Investigation of the obtained results allows the extraction of irrelevant papers by applying limitations and acquiring documents that focus only on the area of interest [9].
## (s7) Identification
(p7.0) This phase considered searching for materials to collect documents related to artificial intelligence and medicine.The first step is the identification performed using the Scopus database to conduct an extensive review.In addition, Boolean operators have been used to save time from inappropriate matches [9].Initially, it was decided to use primary keywords that describe the general idea of research, "Machine learning" OR "Health."

(p7.1) The search was conducted to understand the topic's popularity over a time interval from 2001 to 2021.Since the area of interest was established in disease prediction of dementia by applying artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning techniques, two keywords were chosen for the first step.The results of this submission show 27,520 papers (in May 2022).For the last 2021 year, 8 852 studies were published, but in 2016, the number of studies reached 1019, which shows an increase of 869%.This describes the recent growing interest in using ML techniques for disease prediction (Table 1).

(p7.2) The next attempt specifies more searches by adding keyword such as "Data" to the previous "Machine learning" OR "Health."This method was used to conduct a thorough analysis of the relevance and development of the application of machine learning methods in the health field and, more specifically, to identify dementia.The total obtained result was 18,333 documents, and the first boost was noticed in 2017, starting with 1124 papers and continuing with 5748 studies in 2021.Again, proving the fact (Fig. 3) that after a long period of slight growth, which was maintained until 2016, the attraction of the theme was reactivated.

(p7.3) Working with this large number of documents is a challenge; therefore, to narrow the circle of publications for systematic literature analysis, the keyword "Dementia" was added to the previous set of keywords "Machine learning," "Health," and "Data."The keyword "Dementia" identified a necessary sector of the requested search and returned 209 files for the past 20 years.

(p7.4) As mentioned before, the first noticeable rise in interest in the topic of machine learning combined with the health field was noticed in 2017, and the research has grown since then.So, the same set of keywords was used to identify the number of publications for the last five years from 2017 to 2021; the final result was 183 works.However, because this review was written in the first part of 2022, it was fair to include documents of completed years and files from 2022 (183+19=202 publications for five months of 2022 year), considering only the future work description process to be informed of the latest innovations [9].
## (s8) Inclusion
(p8.0) After completing identification, the next step was the inclusion/exclusion process.This stage involves the selection process of documents, in which outcomes in the final set of publications are addressed to perform bibliometric analyses [9].First, we analyzed the returned 202 files for the top five most repetitive keywords.They turned out to be the leading search keywords, such as "Machine   Learning", "Dementia", and new "Controlled Study", "Major Clinical Study", "Alzheimer diseases", and "Neurodegenerative diseases", shown in Table 2, with the purpose of going to the next step of inclusion/exclusion.According to the results of the keyword examination (shown in Fig. 4), a new search on the Scopus database was initiated.Filters such as the five mentioned keywords and the period from 2017 to 2022 were applied to the investigation.This attempt reimbursed 54 documents, thus reducing the previous sum of the files.Papers that fulfilled specific exclusion criteria were excluded.
## (s11) Country analyses
(p11.0) This study used VOSViewer software to analyze 54 studies to comprehend relations between countries and authors through a scientific map and recognize countries that contribute the most to the application of ML in health.Forty-eight counties participated in the analysis.The data were extracted from the Scopus database and used to create the bibliometric network.The type of analysis is co-authorship, and the unit is the country.The threshold for the minimum number of documents for a country is one.The network graph was generated based on the set parameters, with the previously determined total strength of co-authorship links with countries.

(p11.1) The Fig. 7 is the bibliometric map describing network among 48 countries of international co-authorship.In this visualization, the unit is the country, and they are specified as labels and circles.The more important a country, the larger its label and its circle relatively.The size of the circle is proportional to the significance of the country and the larger number of articles published by the authors from that country.The lines connecting circles represent collaborations between organizations in these countries [13].The thickness of the lines describes the number of publications, and an extended distance can show a weak similarity of works.Each circle has its own color and a set of similar color circles close to each other built cluster.Consistent with the clustering technique, VOSViewer splits into 10 clusters of different colors (yellow, purple, green, blue, orange, etc.), and there are large and small clusters [12].

(p11.2) It is clear from the map, that two clusters (yellow and purple) with spread connections and grander than the others.The yellow cluster represents countries with works linked to the United States (28,82%), and the next purple cluster illustrates works with the United Kingdom (25,88%).After the last two countries, one more European country might be mentioned, such as the Netherlands (14,12%) with 24 international collaborations, whereas Germany has 12 total links strengths and Portugal has two international collaborations.The leader among Asian countries is China (13,53%) with 23 total link strengths, followed by Hong Kong (22 links), and South Korea (12 links).
## (s16) RQ2: the aim of ML methods usage
(p16.0) In this study, [15], investigated the possibility of classifying AD patients among 158 patients with MCI or dementia of various causes based on a neuropsychological test (NPT).The algorithm Support Vector Classifier was used to predict AD based on the results of the tests conducted and achieved high accuracy, 82-89%.Another study [16] aimed to identify morphological changes in brain tissue caused by AD and set it up as a diagnostic marker.The authors developed techniques for automatically detecting and segmenting the corpus callosum.1437 MRIs were applied in a multivariate pattern analysis using SVM.
