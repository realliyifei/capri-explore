## (s1) Design and protocol
(p1.0) This is an overview of reviews on the effects of psychosocial work environment interventions.We structured the overview in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (18).Although PRISMA was devel-oped for reviews of primary studies rather than overview of reviews, most PRISMA items are applicable.
## (s9) Quality assessment
(p9.0) Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the reviews using the "Health Evidence Quality Assessment Tool" (20), (e-Appendix 4).The instrument includes ten yes/no questions (table 1) yielding a total score of 0-10 points.Scores of 0-4, 5-7 and 8-10 points indicate weak, moderate, and strong quality, respectively.Disagreements were solved through discussion and by involvement of a third reviewer, if necessary.
