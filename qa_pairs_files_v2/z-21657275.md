## (s1) CHAPTER 2 DEROUICH MODEL OF DENGUE FEVER
(p1.0) We first study the model of Dengue fever developed by Derouich et al in [3]. Their model is based on the compartmental diagram shown in Figure 2 For the human population, the model developed by Derouich et al., [3], takes the

(p1.1) The parameter values are described in Table 2.1. One of the key features of the model is the fraction, p, that represents a (random) fraction of the human population that can be permanently immunized against the four serotypes that cause Dengue fever.
