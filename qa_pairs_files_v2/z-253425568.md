## (s4) Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis
(p4.0) Multiple sclerosis is a complex pathology with continuous inflammatory activity within the CNS (Central Nervous System), giving rise to tissue damage that results in brain and spinal cord atrophy and irreversible neurological disability. MS affects over 2.5 million people worldwide, especially women and young, usually with an age of onset between 18 and 40 years, seriously reducing the life quality and causing a significant financial burden (Walton et al., 2020).
