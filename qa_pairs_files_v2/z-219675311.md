## (s2) REQUIREMENT OF TELEDENTISTRY
(p2.0) Teledentistry can improve the accessibility to oral health care, upgrade the delivery of oral health care as well as lower its cost. It also has the prospective to terminate the disparities in the oral health care between rural and urban communities. Teledentistry may also turn out to be the fastest as well as cheapest method to bridge the rural and urban health divide and also can help in bringing specialized health care to the remotest corners of the world [6].
