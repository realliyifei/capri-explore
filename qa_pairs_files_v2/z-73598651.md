## (s9) Response Variables Investigated
(p9.0) The consequences of climate change and associated temperature shifts for species and populations are simple in principle: they can respond by range shifts; adaptation via evolutionary (genetically based) change or phenotypic plasticity; or become extinct.These responses may in turn impact higher level processes, community composition, and ecosystem functioning.A minority (30%) of the studies reviewed here specifically addressed one of the three ultimate species-level consequences of climate change, viz.range shifts, whereas no study addressed extinction or adaptation (Figure 2b).Approximately one fifth (22%) of studies investigated reproductive life-history traits or individual survival which can ultimately influence extinction risk, and one tenth (8%) concerned range shifts (Figure 2b).None of the studies reviewed here provided evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change-as discussed in greater detail elsewhere [15].
