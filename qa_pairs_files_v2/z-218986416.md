## (s14) Gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus capecitabine
(p14.0) The ongoing phase III ACTICCA-01 trial was initiated in 2014 to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant gemcitabine plus cisplatin every three weeks for a total of eight cycles versus observation in patients with cholangiocarcinoma or muscle-invasive gallbladder cancer following complete surgical resection. (Stein et al., 2015) After the presentation of the BILCAP trial results in 2017 at the ASCO meeting, the protocol has been amended to compare gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus capecitabine every three weeksinstead of observation. Patients stratification is based on lymph node status (N0 versus N1) and the localization of the tumor. A total of 781 patients will be included from various centers in Europe and Australia. The primary endpoint is RFS and the secondary endpoints are OS, adverse events, and quality of life.
