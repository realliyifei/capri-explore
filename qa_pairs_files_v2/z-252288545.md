## (s8) Discussion
(p8.0) Our survey demonstrates significant variability in the adherence to the explored recommendations for spinal trauma. This was coupled to disparities of income and to locoregional/geographical variation. Previous studies also showed a lower rate of adherence in LMICs than in HICs to some guidelines for the management of spinal trauma, mainly in the pre-hospital phases of treatment (Lepard et al., 2022).
