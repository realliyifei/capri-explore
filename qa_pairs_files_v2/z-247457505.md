## (s23) Improved planting density and distance
(p23.0) Careful management of the planting density, which is controlled by the planting ratio and distance, can improve intercropping. This could be accomplished by designing the planting pattern in narrow and wide rows, which allows maize plants to grow in narrow rows and soybean plants to grow in wide rows all the while preserving the appropriate distance for soybean plants to receive adequate light for optimal growth and development. Designing an efficient intercropping planting setup with a maximum shade density ranging from 20% to 30% (Raza et al., 2019b) to increase the soybean crop seed production in an intercropping system could be a promising future research topic.

(p23.1) The compact maize 'Zhendan-958' has a smaller shade area, making it better for relay cropping. Compact type maize cultivars were found to be more useful to reinforce production, which help to create better light conditions for sweet potato development (Yulong et al., 2017).
