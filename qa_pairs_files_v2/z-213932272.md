## (s11) Planning, decision making and vehicle control
(p11.0) The process of planning and decision-making includes route planning, behavioral decision-making and motion planning. Path planning is to select a route from the current position to the destination through the road network. By representing road network as a weighted directed graph corresponding to the cost of traversing a road segment, path planning can be converted into the problem of finding a minimum-cost path on the road network graph. Behavioral decision-making is to select the appropriate driving behavior at a specific time point based on the perceived behavior of other traffic participants (brake lights, turning lights, etc.), road conditions and infrastructure signals. In this process, machine learning based techniques (such as Gaussian mixture models, Gaussian process regression, etc.) and probabilistic planning (such as MDPs and their generalizations) are required to predict intention and estimate future trajectories of other traffic participants and then dictate driving actions. Motion planning is to translate selected driving behavior into a path/trajectory, to ensure dynamic feasibility and efficiency for vehicle, to ensure safety and comfort for passengers, and to avoid collisions with detected obstacles. Numerical approximation methods such as non-linear optimization in function space, graph-search approaches for the shortest path and incremental tree-based approaches to select the best branch are widely used.

(p11.1) The core function of vehicle control is path tracking/trajectory control, which executes the path/trajectory specified by the motion planning system, by selecting appropriate actuator inputs to carry out the planned motion and using a feedback controller to correct tracking errors, and ensures the reference path or trajectory stability in the presence of modeling errors and other uncertainties [15].

(p11.2) In the aspect of E/E architecture, distributed architecture is widely used, under which a large number of ECU units work together to provide various functions for drivers. With the demand for higher level automation (demanding an unprecedented increase in sensor technology, data bandwidth, processing performance, safety and security, etc.) and vehicle connectivity, from distributed processing to centralized processing gradually has become the main development trend of vehicle control, as shown in Table 1. Centralized E/E architecture will achieve higher overall system efficiency, faster system response time, and reduced performance requirements for lower level ECUs, with extremely high performance requirement for the high-level ECU and development/evaluation difficulties. The migration path of this process is firstly to add partial domain controllers to deal with sensor fusion and decision-making, so that more core functional modules are concentrated in the domain controllers, to achieve functional integration and domain fusion, and ultimately to realize a high-level vehicle controller managing overall autonomous strategy, passing decision information to lower level systems.
