## (s9) Consequences of epigenetic changes in IL-6 and ACE2 associated with COVID-19
(p9.0) Yao et al. conducted a study to elucidate the regulatory effect of chromosome 3p21.31 (genetic susceptibility locus for COVID-19) [81] in immune cell lines (THP-1, HL-60, Jurkat, and K562 resembling human monocytes, promyelocyte, T lymphocytes, and erythroid respectively) [18]. With CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genomic deletion, CCR9 and SLC6A20 were found to be target genes in the locus. Their investigation revealed six fine-mapped variants (rs34326463, rs76374459, rs73064425, rs13081482, rs35652899, and rs35044562) overlapping human T-cell specific primed enhancers. These findings insinuate of an epigenetic regulatory mechanism that can influence the T cell functions towards SARS-Cov-2 infection [18].
