## (s13) D. PALMPRINT TEMPLATE MATCHING METHODS
(p13.0) Matching shows the resemblance between data sets created by comparing the unfamiliar person's feature codes and those held in the system. Moreover, for a specific person's features, the score will be high and low for those who are different [90]. As earlier mentioned, feature extraction and matching are the most critical problems in palm print technology, which is equally grouped into holistic-based, feature-based and hybrid methods. Table 6 shows the various palmprint comparison methods, while Figure 16 shows the palm print matching/classification method.
