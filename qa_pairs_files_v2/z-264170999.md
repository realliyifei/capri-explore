## (s3) Review selection
(p3.0) The study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 16 with methods established prior to conducting the umbrella review.The protocol was registered on the international prospective register for systematic reviews PROSPERO (record no.CRD42023392281, see online supplemental appendix 1A).The objective was to capture systematic reviews, with or without metaanalyses, and narrative reviews aimed at mapping placebo and nocebo effects, or related effects, associated with pharmacological interventions.These studies were then to be informative in terms of biological mechanisms and/ or effect sizes.

(p3.1) The electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE/ PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched in September 2022, according to the search equation provided in online supplemental appendix 1B.The search was conducted applying the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study (PICOS) criteria reported in table 1, and no time restrictions were set.

(p3.2) Regarding the interventions, we excluded the investigation of placebo/nocebo effects and placebo-related/ nocebo-related effects in non-pharmacological interventions (eg, psychotherapy, acupuncture, surgery, neuromodulation, physical therapies, hypnosis, mindfulness training, biofeedback, neurofeedback, music) in order to circumscribe the area of investigation and reduce the degree of methodological variability among studies.
## (s6) Critical appraisal
(p6.0) EF and FP independently appraised the captured systematic reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool, which has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and construct validity. 17In assessing the overall quality of individual studies, more weight was given to the AMSTAR 2 critical domains (ie, 7 out 16 items). 17About the protocol domain, an explicit statement was required that the methods had been established prior to conducting the systematic review and/or that PRISMA guidelines 16 or those for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies 18 had been adhered to, and/or that any deviations from protocol had been reported.

(p6.1) In online supplemental appendix 2, the full assessment according to AMSTAR 2 tool was provided for each of the examined systematic reviews, including the seven critical domains marked in yellow and the final positive or negative rating.

(p6.2) Because of the real heterogeneity in the examined conditions and in studies design included in each systematic review, we did not use funnel plots and we choose to summarise the umbrella review results mainly through narrative synthesis and tables.
