## (s6) Review Addressing Food Choice and Nutrition Among Older Consumers
(p6.0) This systematic review [36] concluded that the most effective way to improve the quality of older consumers' diets is by a comprehensive approach to a healthier lifestyle that includes nutrition education, more physical activity, but also that alters the availability of foods considered to be healthier by most recommendations (e.g., foods of plant origin, such as nuts, fruits, vegetables, pulses, olive oil), and thus improving the quality of the diet. It is important to consider that sensory characteristics [31,36,50] of foods for older people are to be underscored during the design of meals and other food products for this consumer segment.
