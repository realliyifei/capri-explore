## (s3) Non-destructive Monitoring of Alternating current field measurement (ACFM) Technology
(p3.0) Alternating current field measurement (ACFM) is a nondestructive testing technology developed from ACPD.The theoretical analysis of ACFM was completed by University of London in 1980s.In the early 90s, it began to be applied to the detection of offshore oil platforms.ACFM uses the effect that defects in conductive materials change the distribution of electromagnetic fields to produce piezoelectrography, and determines defects by measuring changes in the distribution of electromagnetic fields and comparing them with electromagnetic fields formed by standard ideal defects.This method combines ACPD and eddy current detection methods, and realizes detection by measuring the magnetic field change near the surface of the detection area, rather than the electric field voltage, so that non-contact defects detection can be achieved.The specific method of determining the size of the defect using the ACFM non-contact method is used: First, an alternating current is input in the area to be measured, and due to the "skin effect", the alternating current will collect on the surface of the conductor.If there is a defect in the test piece, the current line will be deflected near the defect, thereby inducing a distorted magnetic field on the test piece.We can then measure the change in the component of the magnetic field with a magnetic field probe to determine the length and depth of the crack [5].ACFM has the following characteristics: (1) Fast detection speed, high precision, qualitative and quantitative detection of crack defects at one time; (2) Implementing non-contact detection without cleaning the paint and coating of the tested surface; (3) Any electrical conductor material can be measured; (4) No complicated instrument calibration is required; (5) Minimize the error caused by human factors; (6) High stability and resolution, it can accurately detect the length and depth of cracks; (7) Sufficient accuracy regardless of the size of the defect; (8) Good adaptability.Due to the above characteristics, ACFM is expected to dominate the area of the detection of underwater structural crack defects, replacing underwater ultrasound, magnetic particle and other detection technologies.
