Fields: Biology

## (s3) Identification of spliceosomal snRNAs
(p3.0) Each genome was searched for the presence of the minor snRNAs U11, U12, U4atac and U6atac using INFERNAL v1.3.3 [58] with covariance models retrieved from Rfam (RF00548, RF00007, RF00618, RF00619). The default Evalue cutoff of 0.01 was used to identify positive snRNA matches, and any snRNA with at least one match below the E-value cutoff was considered present.

LLM judge: NO

Violates Criteria 6: The content contains technical terms and acronyms such as snRNAs, U11, U12, U4atac, U6atac, INFERNAL, and Rfam without providing explanations or context for non-experts to understand. 
Other issues: The content is highly specialized and may be difficult for a general audience to grasp without additional background information.

## (s6) Intron position within transcripts and intron phase
(p6.0) Included in the output of intronIC [56] is information about the relative position of each intron within its parent transcript, represented as a percentage of the total length of coding sequence, as well as intron phase (for introns defined by CDS features). These were extracted for every species and used in the associated analyses.

LLM judge: YES

## (s14) Intron retention and splicing efficiency
(p14.0) For each RNA-seq sample, IRFinder-S v2.0 [53] was used to compute intron retention levels for all annotated introns. Introns with warnings of "LowSplicing" and "Low-Cover" were excluded from downstream analyses. Across replicates within each cell type, a weighted mean retention value was calculated for each intron, with weights derived by combining the average number of reads supporting the two intron-exon junctions and the total number of reads supporting the exon-exon junction.

LLM judge: NO

Violated criteria: 6. The content contains too many technical terms and specialized terms that may not be easily understood without prior knowledge in the field.

Other issues: The content is highly technical and specific to a scientific process, which may not be generally informative or useful for a question answering dataset without more context or explanation.

## (s17) Minor intron diversity in thousands of eukaryotic genomes
(p17.0) In order to better assess the landscape of minor intron diversity in eukaryotes, we used the intron classification program intronIC [56] to process ∼270 million intron sequences and uncover minor intron numbers for over 3000 publicly-available eukaryotic genomes, representing to our knowledge the largest and most diverse collection of minor intron data assembled to date (Fig. 1, underlying plain text data available at https://doi.org/10.6084/ m9.figshare.20483655).

## (s18) Minor intron enrichment
(p18.0) A number of cases of minor-intron-rich lineages are worth highlighting. As shown in Fig. 3, the highest known minor intron density is found within the Amoebozoa; our recentlyreported data in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum [41] dwarfs all other known instances of local minor intron enrichment and appears to be an extremely rare example of significant minor intron gain. In the present study, we also find relatively high numbers of minor introns (compared to other amoebozoan species) in both the flagellar amoeba Pelomyxa schiedti (n=90) and the variosean amoeba Protostelium aurantium (labeled Planoprotostelium fungivorum 1 in Fig. 1) (n=265). Although the numbers of minor introns in these species conserved with minor introns in other lineages (e.g., human) are very low, in all cases we find at least some degree of conservation. For example, in alignments between human and P. aurantium orthologs, 11% of human minor introns are conserved as minor introns in P. aurantium, comparable to proportions shared between human and many plant species [56]; in alignments with P. schiedti the proportion of conserved human minor introns is closer to 2.5%, although this appears to largely be due to massive minor-to-major conversion of ancestral minor introns in P. schiedti, as 69% of the human minor introns in those alignments are paired with major introns in P. schiedti.

(p18.1) As reported by Gentekaki et al. [28], the parasitic microbe Blastocystis sp. subtype 1 within the stramenopiles contains hundreds of minor introns, although our pipeline identifies ∼45% fewer (n=253) than previously described. Interestingly, the Blastocystis sp. subtype 1 minor introns we identify are highly enriched for the AT-AC subtype (77% or 196/253, where AT-AC introns are only ∼26% of all minor introns in human), and the classic minor intron bias away from phase 0 is inverted, with 49% (124/253) of the putative minor introns in Blastocystis being phase 0. Blastocystis also has the shortest average minor intron length in the data we analyzed at just under 42 bp (median 39 bp) (introns shorter than 30 bp were systematically excluded in all species).

## (s20) Minor introns have lower average conservation than major introns
(p20.0) A persistent result in the minor intron literature is that minor introns are more highly conserved than major introns (specifically, between animals and plants and even more specifically, between human and Arabidopsis thaliana) [4], although this assertion has been contradicted by at least one more recent analysis [56]. The claim that minor intron conservation exceeds major intron conservation largely rests upon the numbers of introns of both types found in identical positions within 133 alignments of orthologous human-Arabidopsis sequences, as reported in Table 1 of Basu et al. [4]. For major (U2-type) introns, they report 115 conserved as major in aligned ortholog pairs, and 1391 as either not present in one of the two orthologs or present as a minor intron; for minor (U12-type) introns, they find 20 conserved and 135 missing/converted. For each intron type, taking the number conserved and dividing by the total number of introns of that type present in the alignments results in conservation percentages of 7.6% ( 115 115+1391 ) for major introns and 12.9% ( 20 20+135 ) for minor introns (although the aforementioned values are not explicitly stated in the text), leading to the conclusion that minor introns are more highly conserved between human and Arabidopsis than are major introns. To the extent that we correctly understand their approach, however, we believe there may be a complication with this analysis.

(p20.1) Examining the ortholog pairs the authors provide in the supplementary data, it is evident that many of the same Arabidopsis sequences are present in multiple ortholog pairs, which suggests that a standard reciprocal-best-hit criteria for ortholog identification was not employed and that certain introns will be counted multiple times within the orthologous alignments. As many minor introns occur in larger paralogous gene families, this methodology could lead to artificial inflation of the calculated minor intron conservation, especially given the small absolute number of minor introns involved. To attempt to more thoroughly address the question of minor vs. major conservation, we identified orthologs in many different pairs of species across a range of evolution-ary distances (see Methods), and calculated intron conservation using the same metric as above. Within more than 100 such comparisons between animals and plants (and more than 60 between animals and fungi), we find no cases where minor intron conservation exceeds major intron conservation (Fig. 5a).

(p20.2) Furthermore, we observe only a handful of cases where minor intron conservation marginally exceeds major intron conservation in alignments of more closely-related species (∼3% greater between the starfish Asterias rubens and the stony coral Orbicella faveolata, for example). In the specific case of human-Arabidopsis considered by Basu et al., our data show minor intron conservation to be around half that of major intron conservation (Table 1). Thus, in the final analysis we find no compelling support for the idea that minor introns are in general more conserved than major introns and in fact, the opposite seems to be true in the vast majority of cases.
