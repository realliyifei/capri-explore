## (s1) HIF-1α expression and research status in the TNBC
(p1.0) Recent studies have shown that the HIF-1 pathway is overactive in TNBC, compared to other isotypes, and that the HIF-1 protein is overexposed in more than 80% of TNBC patients. [13,14]Several signaling pathways, noncoding RNA, inflammatory mediators secreted by tumor cells, in the TNBC tumor microenvironment of oxygen levels, and other factors could all play a role.Moreover, epigenetic changes control HIF-1's expression.Several factors control HIF-1's expression, which is more favorable in TNBC.For instance, HIF-1 is expressed on the surface of cancer cells through its interaction with chemokines, and also can be activated by cytokine receptors.Without a sufficiently high drug concentration locally, even a normoxic tumor microenvironment does not guarantee that all tumor cells are sensitive to chemotherapy, especially when treated tumor cells activate survival molecules such as HIF-1.To determine the effects of doxorubicin on normoxic HIF-1a accumulation, we selected several doxorubicin concentrations in the ranges of in vivo drug concentrations in 4T1 and MCF-7 tumors.
