## (s8) C7 Intralaminar Screw Fixation
(p8.0) Another option of screw fixation at C7 is translaminar screws. This can be a very helpful bailout technique when C7 fixation is need and the lateral mass/pedicle screw fixation is not possible. The freehand technique for C7 translaminar screw is described as following 25,26 :

(p8.1) 1. A small initial hole is made about 4 mm at the caudal aspect of the spinolaminar junction, whereas the second hole is made in the rostral aspect of the spinolaminar junction on the other side. 2. A hand drill is then used aimed the opposite lamina with slightly increments, checking violation of the cortical with a ball trip probe. Screws of about 3.5 Ã‚ 24 mm are then inserted. 25 Figure 9 illustrates the surgical technique.
