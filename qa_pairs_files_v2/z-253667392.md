## (s4) Related Application in Tooth Regeneration
(p4.0) The molecules controlling tooth innervation may be applied for achieving better regeneration of the tooth neural network. In a study of preserving immature teeth with nonvital pulp, the application of amelogenin after root canal treatment successfully induces pulp regeneration with a dense neural network [47]. Amelogenin is a vital component of the enamel matrix. This confirms molecules other than neurotrophins and semaphorins may also regulate tooth innervation and again demonstrates that a developing tooth controls its own innervation.

(p4.1) Similarly, neurotrophins and semaphorins may also be applied in tooth and periodontium regeneration. However, this study, like many other regeneration studies, did not compare the distribution, pattern, and function of the regenerated pulp neural network with those of a natural one, meaning the regeneration may not be fully successful. Therefore, if neurotrophins and semaphorins are really to be applied, their physiological expression pattern during tooth development should be carefully scrutinized to instruct proper application so that the tooth neural network can best mimic a natural one.
