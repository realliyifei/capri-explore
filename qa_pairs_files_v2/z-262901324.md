## (s3) Search strategy
(p3.0) The report followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [27].A comprehensive search of both peer-and non-peer-reviewed articles from online bibliographic databases and grey literature search using relevant MeSH words or subheadings of keywords was conducted in May 2022.

(p3.1) Studies of community engagement as a health intervention for the support of mental well-being among children and mothers experiencing housing insecurity were identified from five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Global Health and Child Development & Adolescent Studies).
## (s5) Screening and selection
(p5.0) All retrieved titles and abstracts were reviewed by one reviewer (NJ) with a second reviewer independently screening 12% of eligible studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria (JA).The interrater reliability was deemed to be in fair agreement (Cohen's Kappa = 0.31) for the title and abstract screenings [33].The third reviewer (A-MB) independently resolved conflicts with planned discussions.Full texts of all eligible articles were retrieved and screened by one reviewer (NJ) using the eligibility criteria and excluded with reason.
## (s6) Data extraction
(p6.0) Data were extracted based on study characteristics (study aims, sample, methods, outcomes).The intervention characteristics (e.g., study context, intervention reason, intervention details, location of intervention, intervention deliverer) were extracted using the TIDieR checklist to standardise the reporting of the intervention [34,35] (Appendix
## (s24) Personal outcomes
(p24.0) Maternal indicators for personal outcomes included self-efficacy, financial stress, transitioning out of homeless shelters, and health literacy.Eight positive findings were identified out of ten personal outcomes across the included studies (self-efficacy, financial stress, communication, family unity and transitioning out of homeless shelter and health literacy for sub-group analysis) (Table 12).Studies included overall findings which identified outcome changes when combining both the intervention and comparator groups.Brown et al., (2020) identified an overall non-significant finding for health literacy post-intervention however upon sub-group analysis, the health literacy among mothers that had low health literacy at baseline had significant improvement in health literacy at follow-up (p = 0.003) [40].
