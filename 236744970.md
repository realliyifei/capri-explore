## Techniques for making conductive textile by incorporating nanomaterials

There are many techniques for making nano-enhanced conductive smart textiles. The different techniques for incorporation of conductive nanofillers in textiles are -


## 1.

Finishing of textiles using conductive nanofillers by dip and dry method or layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition [19] 2. Nanocoating of conductive fillers on textiles by different techniques such as sputter coating, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electroless plating etc. [20] 3.

Coating of conductive polymer nanocomposites on textiles [16] 4. Use of conducting polymer nanocomposite fibers for making conductive yarn/fabric [18] 5.

Preparation of polymer nanocomposite-based nanofibers by electrospinning process [21] Applications of conductive textiles

In conjugation with conductive nanomaterials, textiles offer many smart features for high-performance applications such as electroconductive textiles, EMI shield textiles, antistatic textiles, textile-sensors, textile batteries, supercapacitors, piezo-electric textiles, thermoregulating textiles, wearable antenna photonic textiles and many others [4,9,22], as summarized in Figure 1.

Recently, conductive smart textiles have huge demand coving a wide range of application areas such as healthcare, sports, workwear and many other technical fields. 


## Conclusion

In summary, different conductive nanofillers have huge potential for enhancing the conductive property of materials which will drive the futuristic development of smarter conductive textiles for multi-direction applications.
