Background: Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are a global public health burden whose resulting morbidity and mortality disproportionately impact low-and middle-income countries with stressed health systems. There is a paucity of published studies that evaluate the sociodemographic distribution of RTCs using nationally representative samples from the African region.Aim: To examine population-wide associations between sociodemographic factors and involvement in RTCs in Kenya.Methods: Data were obtained from the 2014 Kenyan Demographic Health Survey, representing all 47 counties in Kenya, from May to October of 2014. We estimated the prevalence of RTCs and utilized logistic regression for bivariate and multivariable analyses to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with RTCs. Study variables included age, place of residence, household wealth index, educational attainment, and history of alcohol consumption. We computed odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A higher prevalence was reported among men (8.76%) versus women (3.22%). The risk factors among men included being 20−34 years of age, living in a rural area (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09, 1.74), drinking alcohol (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11, 1.59), and having not higher than a primary (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.19, 3.03) or secondary (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.04, 2.71) education. The strongest risk factors for women included the being aged 45−49 (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.44, 3.67) and 20−24 years (OR 1.81, 95% 1.17, 2.79) as well as being in the fourth wealth quintile (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.15, 2.91). Conclusion: Men and the most economically productive age groups were more likely to report being involved in RTCs. Strategies to reduce the occurrences of RTCs should prioritize the most vulnerable sociodemographic groups. K E Y W O R D S Africa, demographic health survey, epidemiology, Kenya, road traffic crashes Health Sci. Rep. 2022;5:e809. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/hsr2 | Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are a global public health threat contributing to 9% of all causes of mortality worldwide 1 and are a major contributor to disability-adjusted life years lost (DALYS) from unintentional injuries. Lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) disproportionately experience 85% of the mortality and 90% of DALYS associated with RTCs. 2 The rapid motorization of transport combined with poorly planned urbanization has put many countries in the African region in a precarious situation with regard to RTCs. 3 For instance, the African region alone is projected to record 6−14 million new cases of traumatic brain injuries resulting from RTCs in 2050. 4 In Kenya, RTCs are the number one cause of unintentional injuries accounting for 36.8%−41.7% of all injuries and 2.4%−10% of injury-related mortality. 5,6 In addition, injuries from RTCs in Kenya had the second highest increase in DALYS between 1990 and 2010. 7 The lack of formalized resilient post-injury psychosocial support systems in LMICs additionally aggravates the personal resource losses arising from RTCs beyond physical debilitation, financial incapacitation to mental distress. 8 Saidi and Mutisto 9 estimated the average duration of hospital stays (away from work) following RTCs in Kenya at 24.3 days at an average cost of Kenyan shillings 31,783 (US$282). Moreover, 51.7% of these patients needed surgical intervention for injuries mainly involving the limbs, head, and neck. Evidence shows that even at 3 months postsurgical intervention, most of these patients do not recover fully to their preinjury level of function. 10 There seems to be a link between sociodemographic factors and the occurrence of RTCs, with the resulting injuries disproportionately affecting the poor. 11 According to Odero et al., 12 men in the most economically productive age group (20−49) are the most affected, contributing up to 75% of injuries compared to their female counterparts. In addition, unemployed and uneducated individuals with a low-wealth index are overrepresented among RTCs. 11 On the other hand, road traffic injuries that affect pedestrians commonly occur in poorly designed urban areas 13 but most fatal ones involving passengers have been reported on highways traversing rural areas, with the two vulnerable groups accounting for 80% of RTC casualties. 12 Knowledge of the most vulnerable populations is key to targeted preventive policy, particularly in LMICs with constrained budgets dedicated to the health sector. Kenya is one of such countries transitioning from an infectious, maternal, and child health disease burden to a noncommunicable and injury-related morbidity and mortality burden. According to Bachani et al., 14 the country experienced a road traffic injury rate of 60 per 100,000 population as of 2009, mainly resulting from speeding motor vehicles and motorcycles. Moreover, injury statistics are often underreported in Kenya due to a lack of robust trauma data registries. 15 The lack of preventive education campaigns, poorly monitored and uncoordinated road safety interventions, lack of coalition RTC event information. RTC events in and of themselves are not equivalent to injuries sustained in the road traffic environment. For this study, it was not possible to estimate the prevalence of injuries as a result of the RTCs. Fourth, the questionnaire did not assess the use of illicit substances. The use of illicit substances could potentially influence RTCs and it may be worthwhile to collect information about their use in future surveys. Finally, assessing alcohol intake viaquestionnaires has been shown to be imprecise, 40 and it is this imprecision that has a tendency to drive associations toward the null.| CONCLUSIONThe present study has revealed that men and the economically productive age groups were more likely to report RTCs. Higher odds of RTCs were also reported by women in the fourth wealth quintile and men with primary or secondary levels of education as well as those who consumed alcohol. There is an urgent need to emphasize injury control measures that simultaneously take into consideration the socio-economic gradients that underpin and influence human behavior. These aspects are important drivers of RTCs at the population level.

among road safety stakeholders, an increasing number of motorcycles, and poorly designed roads in congested urban areasare major contributing factors to RTCs in Kenyan settings. 9,12,13 For instance, whereas 57%−58% of cars in Kenya's main cities are driven above local speed limits, 7 seat belt use among drivers and passengers is reported at 12.5%. 1 Furthermore, helmet use is at 33% and 3% among motorcyclists and their passengers, respectively, 14 despite the known severe head injury risk for non-helmet use. 16 In addition, only 8.5% of road traffic crash incidents are reported to police for legal action 17 with 8.1% of RTCs in Kenya being at least partly linked to alcohol-influenced driving. 1 Unfortunately, the legal enforcement of the traffic act in Kenya has not yielded any reduction in injury severity. 18 Despite the poor trauma care indices in the country, 19 Kenya is regarded as one of the countries in the African region with an improved prehospital care system, 20 


## | Sampling approach

A two-stage cluster sampling design was used in KDHS-2014 for providing a representative sample on a range of health and population indices, including involvement in RTCs at the national level, for urban and rural areas separately, and at the regional/provincial levels. 


## | Study variables

A single question in the KDHS-2014 inquired about involvement in RTCs. This outcome variable was determined from the question, "In the past 12 months, have you been involved in a road traffic accident as a driver, passenger, pedestrian, or a cyclist?". Affirmative answers were coded as 1 and negative answers were coded as 0. 


### | Residence

Residency status in terms of urban or rural was examined. The urban residency status was used as the reference group in the bivariate and multivariable analyses.


### | Wealth index

Each household's wealth index was calculated in the KDHS-2014 based on ownership of certain assets and categorized into five groups, that is, quintiles ranging from "lowest," "second," "middle," "fourth,", and "highest." The lowest age wealth quintile was used as the reference group in the bivariate and multivariable analyses.


### | Educational attainment

Four categories were used to determine educational attainment ranging from "no education," "primary education," "secondary education," and the final category entailing "higher" educational attainment.

The no education group was used as the reference group in the bivariate and multivariable analyses.


### | Alcohol use

This was determined from the KDHS-2014 question, "Do you drink alcohol?", with binary response options of either "yes" or "no." The alcohol nonuser group was used as the reference group in the bivariate and multivariable analysis.


## | Data analysis

The "women" and "men" data sets of the KDHS-2014 were downloaded in the STATA format from the DHS program website, after obtaining written permission. 21 The complex survey design of the KDHS-2014 was taken into account. Proportions, presented as percentages, were calculated separately for both sexes, including their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Associations between the RTCs and sociodemographic characteristics, that is: age, place of residence in terms of urban/rural residency status, household wealth index, and educational attainment, were determined using simple binary logistic regression models.

Additionally, the association between alcohol use and RTCs was also determined. Results are reported as odds ratios and their corresponding 95% CIs. Variable associations that were found to be statistically significant at the level of p < 0.05 were included in the final multivariable logistic regression model, and adjusted odds ratios and their 95% CIs are reported. The final multivariable models were found to have a good fit based on the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for survey data. 23 All analysis was conducted using STATA version 16 (StataCorp).


## | Ethical considerations


## KDHS-2014 was granted ethical approved by the Kenya Medical

Research Institute. Data were collected after receiving informed consent from every participant. 22 For this study, ethical approval was not applicable since this is a secondary analysis of the publicly available data.


# | RESULTS

A total of 440 women (3.22%: 95% CI 2.80−3.69) and 1123 men (8.76%: 95% CI 8.02−9.57) reported having sustained an RTC in the 12 months preceding the survey. Table 1 shows the results of the exploratory data analysis in terms of RTC proportions and their corresponding 95% CIs, for both women and men disaggregated by the five explanatory variables, and their unweighted counts. The highest prevalence of RTCs in women was found in the 45-49-year age group (4.93%), while the lowest prevalence was in the 30-34-year age group (2.05%). In men, the highest prevalence was reported by the 25-29-year-old group (11.29%), while the lowest prevalence was reported by the 50-54-year-old group (3.67%). The relationship between age and the occurrence of RTCs is presented in counterparts. On the other hand, men living in rural areas reported a higher RTC prevalence (9.59%), compared to men from urban areas.

For educational attainment, women with higher educational status reported the highest RTC prevalence (3.76%), and those with no education reported the lowest (1.34%). For men, the highest prevalence was reported by those with primary education (9.64%), and those with no education the lowest (5.39%). For household wealth index in terms of quintile, the highest RTC prevalence was reported by women in the fourth quintile (4.17%), and the lowest prevalence was reported by those in the lowest wealth quintile (1.89%). In men, the highest RTC prevalence was reported in the middle quintile (10.03%), and the lowest in the highest wealth quintile. For both women as well as men, those who reported use of alcohol had a higher RTC prevalence with 5.28% in women and 10.52% in men. Tables 2 and 3 show the results of simple and multivariable logistic regression models in terms of crude odds ratios (OR), adjusted odds ratios (aOR), their statistical significance, and the associated 95% CIs for women and men, respectively. Based on the results of the binary simple logistic regression models: out of five explanatory variables, among women residency status in terms of urban/rural residency was not found to be statistically significant, while in men 


# | DISCUSSION

The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of RTCs and the associated factors. The prevalence was 3.22% among women and 8.76% among men. A higher prevalence was also observed among the economically productive age groups in both women and men.

We found that age groups lying within ( Men residing in rural areas were more likely to report RTCs.

However, a higher risk among urban dwellers was reported in a nationally representative Ethiopian study. 30 17 In addition, the psychosocial stress and substance abuse among the uneducated poor could contribute to their vulnerability to RTCs. 35 African men are twice as likely to engage in substance use compared to their female counterparts 36 


## and for

Kenya's situation, this assertion is true even at the time of the road traffic crash. 37 Men who consumed alcohol were more likely to report RTCs.

Gathecha et al., 6 found no association between alcohol consumption and road traffic injuries in a nationally representative sample in Kenya. In this study, it was not possible to ascertain whether the consumption of alcohol had a direct influence on the RTCs reported.

The Kenyan national alcohol consumption rate is reported at 13.3% 38 and there are instances of drunk driving according to the police reports. 11 Drunk driving, in combination with other environmental and behavioral factors or vehicle characteristics, is likely to exacerbate RTC incidents. 11 Behavioral changes to improve road safety in general are still required to reduce the incidence of RTCs and safeguard the population to minimize avoidable injuries which may arise.


## | Study limitations

The present study was not without limitations. First, the data are silent on the involvement of children and adolescents less than 15 years of age in traffic collisions. RTCs are known to be one of the most significant contributors to traumatic brain injuries among children outside of the home environment. 34,39 Second, information concerning the location of the RTC event was not captured in the survey, which would be a useful consideration when designing targeted strategies for prevention efforts. Third, the question about the RTCs asked in the questionnaire was not sufficiently explicit in its SHAIKH ET AL. | 7 of 9


signifying the disproportionate unmet need for trauma care in the region. However, there is a paucity of published studies that have evaluated the sociodemographic distribution of RTCs in Kenya which involve nationally representative samples. A similar study by Odhiambo et al., 19 was limited to general trauma-related mortality in rural western Kenya. The present study explored RTCs and associated sociodemographic variables using a nationally representative sample from the Kenyan contribution to the Demographic and Health Survey (2014).

Study design We used previously collected Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey 2014 (KDHS-2014) data to inform this study. DHS surveys have been conducted in 91 LMICs in collaboration with each country's national agencies and the DHS program. DHS surveys are one of the only or the most recent nationally representative surveys available on health and demographic indices in participating countries. The KDHS-2014, for the very first time, provided national estimates on RTC events as well as on other unintentional injuries. The KDHS-2014 is the sixth DHS conducted in the Republic of Kenya. Additional information is available elsewhere. 21

The lowest age group of 15−19 years was used as the reference group in the bivariate and multivariable analyses.

Data were collected from all 47 counties from clusters sampled with a probability proportional to the size sampling methodology. From a total of 96,251 enumeration areas, based on the 2009 Kenya Population and Housing Census, in the first stage, 1,612 clusters were selected (995 rural and 617 urban areas), while in the second stage, 25 households were randomly selected from each cluster, resulting in a total of 39,679 households selected for the final sample. 22 2.3 | Data collection The survey was conducted by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in partnership with the Ministry of Health. The data collection phase of the KDHS-2014 was done from May to October 2014. 21 KDHS-2014 asked the question, "In the past 12 months, have you been involved in a road traffic accident as a driver, passenger, pedestrian, or a cyclist?". The responses were coded as either "yes" or "no." Cumulatively, 14,730 women aged 15−49 years and 12,816 men aged 15−54 years answered the question on RTC involvement in the 12 months preceding the survey.


adherence to traffic laws. Traffic laws are less likely to be enforced in rural areas where there is a limited presence of traffic police.11,31  Approximately 60% of RTCs have occurred on rural roads in Kenya.12 On the other hand, it was not possible to determine the location where the RTC events occurred in this study nor examine subpopulations such as pedestrians, passengers, or drivers.For the wealth index variable, women in the fourth quintile were 1.8 times more likely to be involved in an RTC event. An Ethiopian study using the 2016 DHS data also found a higher risk among the higher wealth quintiles.30 Globally, the occurrence of unintentional injuries tends to decline with increasing social demographic index 32 ; however, the road traffic injuries seem to follow an opposite trend.1 This might be attributable to automobile ownership which is reported to be high among individuals with a higher wealth index, 33 but because the casualties might be pedestrians, passengers, or drivers, this association might be hard to ascertain.In addition, we found that RTC events were significantly associated with men with primary and secondary educational attainment but not women. In a similar study byBachani et al.,34 education and being in school were protective against injuries even after controlling for age, gender, occupation, and the country's income profile. However, in this Kenyan study, the increased risk among the men with primary and secondary education could be attributed to insufficient exposure to safe traffic practices. Having minimal educational attainment as a risk to RTCs might be due to inadequate exposure to preventive education information such as road traffic signs that are largely embedded into the country's standard school curriculum. Individuals with inadequate exposure to road traffic safety information are 1.3 times more likely to be involved in RTCs.As opposed to our study that only had 

information on RTC events with no mention of injuries, the Ethiopian 

study collected information about road traffic casualties, for instance, 

resulting in death or severe injuries. 30 It is possible that a number of the 

RTC events in Kenya happened along rural roads due to inadequate
