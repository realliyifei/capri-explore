participants were more likely to watch TV when they were with close family members (e.g., spouse, grown children) than with friends or acquaintances. Findings from these multiple methods suggest that close family may encourage risks (e.g., sedentary behaviors) as well as benefits in late life. In this presentation we discuss challenges and opportunities presented by the use of mixed methods to study continuity, change, and conflict related to religion-and the absence of religion-in multigenerational families. Discussion centers on the complementarity of quantitative and qualitative approaches, strategic decisions in tone and emphasis of the manuscript, and uncertainties in navigating the peer review process. An empirical example is provided to illustrates these points. We present an analysis that tracked patterns of religious change across three generations using survey data and in depth interviews emphasizing epistemological issues in knowledge generation.

## ASIAN OLDER ADULTS' ONLINE AND OFFLINE HEALTH INFORMATION PREFERENCES AND BEHAVIORS

Chair: Bo Xie, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States Co-Chair: Kristina Shiroma, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States Older adults living in Asia or of Asian origin have unique preferences for information that require special attention. This symposium focuses on the health information preferences and behaviors of Asian older adults. Song et al. investigated the relationship between Internet use and perceived loneliness among Older Chinese using from survey data collected in the 2015 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a national study involving 12,400 households in Mainland China. Multiple regression results suggest that older Chinese Internet users perceived significantly less loneliness compared with their age peers who were non-Internet users. Zhang et al. investigated the role of information and communication technologies in supporting antiretroviral therapy (ART)-related knowledge seeking among older Chinese with HIV. Their cross-sectional survey data were collected from 2012 to 2013 in Guangxi, China. The results suggest that less than 5% of the participants sought HIV-related information via computers. Patients less knowledgeable about ART were more likely than those more knowledgeable to consult medical professionals about the disease via cell phones. Shiroma et al. report findings of a systematic literature review conducted in spring 2019 that examined Asian ethnic minority older adults' preferences for end-of-Life (EOL) information seeking and decision making. The results suggest Asian ethnic minority older adults are understudied in the literature on EOL information and decision making, especially in terms of their unique cultural contexts. Du et al. examined how health information obtained from different types of social networks affect osteoporosis self-management behaviors among older White and Asian women.

Older adults of Asian ethnic minority groups are often underrepresented in the literature on cultural aspects of end-of-life (EOL) decision making. This literature review aimed to systematically investigate the cultural aspects of EOL decision making for aging adults of Asian ethnic minority groups. In February 2019, systematic searches were conducted in PubMed using MeSH terms "end-of-life", "decision-making", and "culture OR cultural". Articles with human subjects, full text in English, published in the past 10 years, with original, empirical findings were included. After multiple rounds of screening, the final sample included 22 results, with sample sizes ranging from 11 to over 9 millions representing South Asian, Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, Singaporean, Asian and Asian/Pacific adults. The findings suggest the literature on older Asian adults is present, but limited. Future research is needed to explore cultural aspects of Asian ethnic minority groups in respect to older adult's information preferences in EOL decision-making. Little is known about how health information obtained from different types of social networks affect health behaviors. This study aimed to explore the effect of health information on osteoporosis management behaviors among White and Asian women from a social capital (SC) perspective using a variety of SC measures (e.g. bonding: family, friends, coworkers; bridging: churches, clubs; linking: health providers). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 412 Innovation in Aging, 2019, Vol. 3, No. S1
