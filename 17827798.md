Biologics such as rituximab are an important component of oncology treatment strategies, although access to such therapies is challenging in countries with limited resources. This study examined access to rituximab and identified potential barriers to its use in the United States, Mexico, Turkey, Russia, and Brazil. The study also examined whether availability of a biosimilar to rituximab would improve access to, and use of, rituximab. Overall, 450 hematologists and oncologists completed a survey examining their use of rituximab in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Less than 40% of physicians considered rituximab as easy to access from a cost perspective. Furthermore, many physicians chose not to treat, were unable to treat, or had to modify treatment with rituximab despite guidelines recommending its use in NHL and CLL patients. Insurance coverage, reimbursement, and cost to patient were commonly reported as barriers to the use of rituximab. Across all markets, over half of physicians reported that they would increase use of rituximab if a biosimilar was available. We conclude that rituximab use would increase across all therapy types and markets if a biosimilar was available, although a biosimilar would have the greatest impact in Brazil, Mexico, and Russia.

standards have been established in Europe based on recommendations set by the European Medicines Agency Committee for Human Medicinal Products [30].

With these issues in mind, the objectives of the current study were to examine the true level of access that physicians in the US, Mexico, Turkey, Russia, and Brazil have to Rituxan™/MabThera™ and to identify potential barriers that may prevent the use of rituximab, as recommended by treatment guidelines [31][32][33], in patients with NHL or CLL. An additional objective of this study was to determine whether the introduction of a biosimilar to rituximab would improve access to, and use of, rituximab in these countries.


## Experimental


### Approach

A survey was designed to yield data on the access to, and usage of, rituximab by hematologists or oncologists in the US and emerging markets, including Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey. The survey was administered from July to August 2013.


### Recruitment

Potential survey participants were identified and engaged by recruiters in each country. Recruiters were native speakers with insight into their country's healthcare systems and cultures. Physicians were identified from proprietary databases, association lists, phone directories, and other commercially available sources. Alternatively, physicians who were already part of a recruiter's online community could request to be part of the survey. Physicians were invited via phone or email and explained the purpose of the survey, why they were chosen to participate, and assured confidentiality of their responses. Those who agreed to participate were sent an email containing a link to the automated online survey. Physicians had to meet the following requirements, via a short screener survey, to participate in the main survey: full-time hematologist or medical oncologist; have been practicing for 2-35 years; ≥75% of time spent in direct patient care; practice is a mixture of hospital-and office-based; and ≥10% of their patients have CLL (at least 10 patients), NHL (at least 25 patients), or other malignancies. Upon completion of the main survey, participants were credited with a gift certificate or honorarium depending on country. Follow-up emails were sent to participants who began, but did not complete, the survey.


### Survey Details

The survey asked questions related to patients with NHL and CLL. Specific questions were related to the following: type of malignancy; disease categories; types of patient insurance encountered; factors considered when making treatment decisions; treatment guidelines commonly followed; accessibility of rituximab; use of rituximab; barriers to the use of rituximab; and questions related to their potential use of a less-expensive (biosimilar) version of rituximab if it were available. Questions were answered in a variety of forms including: yes/no; percentages (example: what percentage of your patients are A, B, or C); 5-or 7-point Likert scales (examples: 1 = never to 5 = always; 1 = very easy to 7 = not at all easy); and select all that apply (example: A through Z). In certain cases, participants were given a text box to further explain their answers if necessary. The survey took approximately 10 minutes to complete.


### Data

In total, 450 physicians completed the survey: 150 in the US and 75 each in Brazil (BRZ), Mexico (MEX), Russia (RUS), and Turkey (TUR). Data are presented as the percentage of physicians reporting a specific response and are given for physicians across all markets and in each individual market examined. The margins of error at a 90% confidence interval were ±3.9% (all markets combined), ±6.7% (US), and ±9.5% (BRZ, MEX, RUS, TUR). The margins of error at a 95% confidence interval were ±4.6% (all markets combined), ±8.0% (US), and ±11.3% (BRZ, MEX, RUS, TUR).


## Results


### Cancer Patient Population

Initially, physicians were asked to describe the cancer patient population under their care. Overall, physicians reported that roughly half (48%) of their cancer patients had a hematological malignancy as opposed to a solid malignancy (Table 1). Across all markets, NHL was the most commonly reported hematological malignancy (40% of all cases), whereas CLL accounted for 26% of all cases and "other hematological malignancies" accounted for the remaining 34% (Table 1). A majority of CLL cases (55% of all CLL patients) were classified as first-line therapy. Likewise, 56% of all FL patients and 60% of all DLBCL patients were classified as first-line therapy. Across all markets, only 14% of physicians reported that their NHL and CLL patients differ with respect to types of insurance coverage utilized. Patients with NHL and CLL were most likely to receive government-funded insurance, particularly in Turkey and Russia (Overall = 51%, US = 39%, BRZ = 27%, MEX = 40%, RUS = 76%, TUR = 86%). Overall, 20% of patients received private medical insurance through their employer (US = 30%, BRZ = 36%, MEX = 15%, RUS = 2%, TUR = 6%), whereas 17% (US = 19%, BRZ = 27%, MEX = 27%, RUS = 7%, TUR = 6%) paid for their own private insurance. Patients in Mexico and Russia were the most likely to have no insurance and pay for medical expenses out of pocket (Overall = 9%, US = 5%, BRZ = 7%, MEX = 18%, RUS = 15%, TUR = 3%).


### Factors Considered When Treating CLL and NHL Patients

Physicians were then asked to identify specific factors they consider when making decisions regarding the treatment of patients with NHL and CLL. Across all markets, physicians reported "goals of therapy" (76%), "treatment guidelines" (73%), and "patient co-morbidities" (73%) as the factors most considered. These were followed by "patient age" (67%), "recommendations from thought leaders" (50%), "patient insurance status" (32%), and "geographic locale" (16%).

A majority of all physicians (Overall = 60%) ranked the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as the most influential treatment guidelines with respect to NHL and CLL patients. Indeed, 71% (US = 92%, BRZ = 49%, MEX = 87%, RUS = 32%, TUR = 73%) of all physicians considered NCCN guidelines when treating patients. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Overall = 45%, US = 43%, BRZ = 38%, MEX = 68%, RUS = 24%, TUR = 52%) and European Society for Medical Oncology (Overall = 38%, US = NA, BRZ = 21%, MEX = 53%, RUS = 26%, TUR = 55%) were also commonly taken into consideration by physicians. Local hospital guidelines were considered by 39% of physicians in Russia.

Physicians were then asked whether the specific clinical guidelines they follow, with respect to the treatment of CLL patients, explicitly recommend the use of rituximab. Across all markets, physicians reported that rituximab is more explicitly recommended for use as first-line therapy (Overall = 86%, US = 95%, BRZ = 93%, MEX = 85%, RUS = 75%, TUR = 75%) or in a relapsed setting (Overall = 82%, US = 89%, BRZ = 92%, MEX = 88%, RUS = 73%, TUR = 63%) than in a refractory setting (Overall = 58%, US = 60%, BRZ = 78%, MEX = 49%, RUS = 55%, TUR = 48%). Physicians were also asked whether the clinical guidelines they follow explicitly recommend the use of rituximab for the treatment of FL. Across all markets, physicians reported that rituximab is more explicitly recommended for use as first-line therapy (Overall = 91%, US = 95%, BRZ = 97%, MEX = 95%, RUS = 87%, TUR = 79%) and as first-line consolidation/maintenance therapy (Overall = 89%, US = 90%, BRZ = 96%, MEX = 88%, RUS = 88%, TUR = 80%) compared with second-line (Overall = 84%, US = 86%, BRZ = 87%, MEX = 83%, RUS = 87%, TUR = 75%) or second-line consolidation/maintenance therapy (Overall = 76%, US = 71%, BRZ = 86%, MEX = 75%, RUS = 84%, TUR = 68%). Finally, physicians were asked the same question with respect to DLBCL patients. Across all markets, physicians reported that rituximab is more explicitly recommended for use as first-line therapy (Overall = 93%, US = 95%, BRZ = 99%, MEX = 99%, RUS = 88%, TUR = 85%) as opposed to use in a relapsed or refractory setting (Overall = 81%, US = 80%, BRZ = 88%, MEX = 75%, RUS = 85%, TUR = 76%).


### Access to Rituximab

Across all markets, only 39% of physicians considered rituximab easy to access from a cost perspective (Table 2). However, this was reported much more by physicians in the US and Turkey than by physicians in Brazil, Mexico, or Russia. Among physicians who rated rituximab access in the middle (a rating of 3, 4, or 5 on a scale from 1 = not at all easy to access to 7 = very easy to access), issues related to cost were a primary reason, especially in Mexico and Russia (Overall = 37%, US = 31%, BRZ = 29%, MEX = 55%, RUS = 42%, TUR = 15%). Insurance coverage issues were also commonly reported, particularly outside the US (Overall = 22%, US = 9%, BRZ = 45%, MEX = 18%, RUS = 14%, TUR = 31%). Cost (Overall = 56%) and insurance (Overall = 31%) issues were also the most frequently reported reasons given by physicians who rated the access to rituximab as poor (a rating of 1 or 2).


### Rituximab Usage and Barriers to Treatment

Physicians were asked to report how frequently (1 = always, 2 = frequently, 3 = not so often, 4 = rarely, 5 = never) they used rituximab in patients with CLL as a first-line therapy, in a relapsed setting, and in a refractory setting. Physicians who reported a score of 3, 4, or 5 were asked to identify the reasons they did not use rituximab in a certain setting (Table 3). Across all markets, common barriers to the use of rituximab as a first-line therapy or in a relapsed setting (the two settings in which rituximab use is most recommended by treatment guidelines) were related to treatment guidelines, cost to patients, accessibility to patients, and insurance coverage. Likewise, physicians were also asked to report how frequently they used rituximab in patients with FL. Across all markets, common barriers to the use of rituximab as a first-line therapy or as a first-line consolidation/maintenance therapy were related to: cost to patients, insurance coverage, and issue with patient compliance (Table 3). Finally, physicians were asked to report how frequently they used rituximab in patients with DLBCL. Across all markets, common barriers to the use of rituximab as a first-line therapy were related to: cost to patients, patient comorbidities, insurance coverage, efficacy, and accessibility to patients (Table 3).

All physicians were asked whether issues related to cost have affected their use of rituximab in the past. One third of all physicians, particularly those outside the US, commonly answered yes to the following question: "Are there any instances where you have not been able to treat a patient with rituximab or have had to delay their treatment due to reimbursement issues", with percentages as follows: US = 16%, BRZ = 45%, MEX = 44%, RUS = 25%, TUR = 49%. Across all markets, the most common reasons for this inability or delay were related to insurance or payment issues (Table 4). Rituximab is typically administered to patients with NHL and CLL over 6-8 cycles [1,2]. A substantial percentage of physicians, particularly in Mexico, Russia and Turkey, reported that they have had to reduce the number of desired rituximab treatment cycles due to cost issues (Overall = 26%, US = 9%, BRZ = 17%, MEX = 52%, RUS = 30%, TUR = 41%). The three most common reasons for reducing the number of cycles were issues related to patient response, insurance coverage, and patients' inability to pay (Table 4).   Across all markets, over half of physicians reported that they would increase their use of rituximab if a less-expensive (30% lower cost) version were available. This was especially evident in Brazil, Mexico, and Russia (Overall = 52%, US = 26%, BRZ = 77%, MEX = 76%, RUS = 63%, TUR = 47%). Hospital did not have funds to provide rituximab 


## Discussion

Physicians participating in this survey reported that roughly half of the cancer patients under their care were treated for a hematological malignancy (range across all markets = 42%-57%). NHL patients represented 40% of hematological malignancy cases, while CLL and "other" represented 26% and 34%, respectively. More than half of all patients with NHL or CLL were classified as first-line therapy.

Nearly three fourths of all physicians reported that they consider clinical guidelines when making treatment decisions regarding their patients with NHL and CLL. More than 80% of physicians reported that the specific treatment guidelines they follow explicitly recommend the use of rituximab for the treatment of CLL (as a first-line therapy or in a relapsed setting), FL (as a first-line therapy, as a first-line consolidation/maintenance therapy, or as a second-line therapy), and DLBCL (as a first-line therapy or in a relapsed/refractory setting). Despite these treatment guidelines, a number of physicians across all markets (range = 12%-22%) reported that they "not so often", "rarely", or "never" use rituximab to treat their patients with CLL (as a first-line therapy or in a relapsed setting), FL (as a first-line therapy, as a first-line consolidation/maintenance therapy, or as a second-line therapy), or DLBCL (as a first-line therapy or in a relapsed/refractory setting). The most common reasons for not utilizing rituximab, across all markets and types of malignancy, were related to insurance coverage, cost to the patient, treatment guidelines, and patient comorbidities. Indeed, less than 40% of physicians considered rituximab as easy to access from a cost perspective. This was especially evident in Brazil (25%), Mexico (19%), and Russia (31%). Outside the US, issues related to cost and insurance coverage were most frequently cited by physicians rating access to rituximab ≤ 5 (on a scale from 1 = not at all easy to 7 = very easy). Such issues commonly led to a change in desired treatment strategy. One-third of all physicians, particularly those in Brazil (45%), Mexico (44%), and Turkey (49%) reported having had to delay treatment with rituximab due to reimbursement issues, mostly related to insurance or patient payment issues. Likewise, a substantial percentage of physicians, particularly in Mexico (52%), Russia (30%), and Turkey (41%) reported that they have had to reduce the number of desired rituximab treatment cycles, most commonly due to issues regarding patient response, insurance coverage, and patient's inability to pay.

Overall, these data demonstrate that a population of physicians chooses not to treat, is unable to treat, or has to modify treatment with rituximab despite explicit guidelines recommending its use in patients with NHL and CLL. Although issues directly related to the patient (such as patient comorbidities) are part of this decision-making process, issues related to insurance coverage, reimbursement, and cost to the patient were commonly reported as barriers to the use of rituximab. Indeed, across all markets, over half of physicians reported that they would increase their use of rituximab if a less expensive version was available. Therefore, we conclude that rituximab use would increase across all therapy types and markets if a biosimilar was available. However, a biosimilar to rituximab would have the greatest impact in the Brazil, Mexico, and Russia since, of all markets examined, physicians from these countries were least likely to rate rituximab as easy to access from a cost perspective. In addition, patients from these countries, especially Mexico and Russia, were most likely to have to pay for medical expenses out of pocket due to a lack of insurance coverage. Finally, physicians from these countries were also the most likely to increase use of rituximab if a less costly version was available.

Such conclusions are reinforced by examining the introduction of Reditux™ to India. Reditux™ (Dr Reddy's) was the first intended biosimilar developed for rituximab [34]. In 2007, Reditux was launched at 50% lower cost than the originator (MabThera™) [34]. Within three years of launch, the number of patients receiving rituximab therapy increased six-fold in India, where the gross national income per capita is roughly $1,500 (data for year 2012) [35] and where a majority of patients have to pay for a substantial portion of their own medical care [34]. Furthermore, a study comparing the cost of intended biosimilar versus originator versions of paclitaxel, gemcitabine, docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan in India found savings of $900-$4300 associated with use of the intended biosimilar versions [36]. This resulted in yearly savings of approximately $843 million dollars for health systems in India [36]. Due to such cost savings, the use of biosimilars to rituximab is expected to substantially increase globally in the near future. Reditux™, for example, has now been marketed in Bolivia, Chile, and Peru [3]. In addition, Probiomed has marketed Kikuzubam™, another intended biosimilar to rituximab, in Mexico. Patents are set to expire shortly in both the US and European Union, providing more opportunities for the use of biosimilars to rituximab [3]. Indeed, a majority of oncologists surveyed (number surveyed = 183) from the US and Europe expect to prescribe biosimilars to common monoclonal antibody treatments within the first 12 months of their launch [37].

The availability of a biosimilar to rituximab will also benefit patient populations outside of the oncology arena. In the US and European Union, for example, rituximab is also approved for the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis (in combination with methotrexate), and for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis (in combination with glucocorticoids) [1,2]. Rituximab is also used to treat idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [38], autoimmune hemolytic anemia [38], thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [39], and Evan's syndrome [38]. Although rituximab is not FDA-approved for any of these benign hematological conditions, its use is supported by evidence-based medicine and recommended by major hematological treatment guidelines such as those provided by the American Society of Hematology. However, our research did not specifically address the use of rituximab in these conditions, and care must be taken when attempting to generalize our findings to other physician/patient populations.

Some of the findings presented in this study, as for all survey research, may be limited in that respondents may not precisely recall their experiences, particularly experiences that happened in the distant past. It should be noted that some survey questions are limited in that answers are framed in the "yes/no", Likert scale, or multiple-choice formats, which may not capture detailed accounts of physician experience or additional, unanticipated responses. However, all attempts were made to include an option of "other: please explain" when appropriate in this survey. Finally, these surveys were conducted across multiple countries having different healthcare systems and cultural backgrounds. Care must be taken in attempting to generalize these findings to physicians from countries not included in the current study.

Our study did not specifically address factors taken into account by physicians when they are considering the use of a biosimilar. Is the safety and efficacy profile of a biosimilar to rituximab a potential concern for physicians? We may infer, at least among physicians who reported that they would use a biosimilar to rituximab, that the safety and efficacy of a biosimilar is not a barrier to use provided these parameters are sufficiently demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Future research is warranted to determine precisely what type and amount of clinical data physicians examine before they are convinced of a biosimilar's safety and efficacy. Additional data will also identify additional factors, other than safety and efficacy, that affect a physician's decision to prescribe a biosimilar. Cost will certainly play a role in this decision. However, government regulations and payer recommendations greatly affect market access of biosimilars and, thus, influence physician treatment decisions.


## Conclusions

Overall, we conclude that a biosimilar to rituximab would increase the use of rituximab in the oncology arena, particularly in the emerging markets of Russia, Mexico, and Brazil. A biosimilar to rituximab would address an unmet need in patients with CLL and NHL who currently do not receive rituximab, or receive less than optimal treatment with rituximab, due to insurance coverage or cost issues related to such treatment.
