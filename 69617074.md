Snakes play essential role in the eco-system and are not indispensable. Deforestation are disturbing the habitat of snakes. Identification of the snake is important in planning treatment in certain areas of the world, but is not always possible. Snake bite is more common, local knowledge not may be sufficient to recognize the snake. Attempting to catch or kill the offending snake also puts one at risk , and generally is not recommended. To prevent this , proposed system is introduce to tackle this problem which can identify accurately the species of snake.
