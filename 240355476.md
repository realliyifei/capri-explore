Emergency contraceptive (EC) pills are used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse. Levonorgestrel is an EC pill, which has been only approved in Japan; it is more eŠective the sooner it is used after intercourse and safe without serious side eŠects. EC pills are already available at accessible community pharmacies in more than 90 countries around the world. In Japan, citizens have signed a petition calling for the sale of emergency contraceptives at community pharmacies. However, little is known about the thoughts of pharmacists who engage with patients and sell medicines at pharmacies. Therefore, we conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey to determine the level of preparation in community pharmacies and the awareness of pharmacists regarding the sale of EC pills. A total of 1338 pharmacists responded to the survey from November 7, 2020, to December 16, 2020. In terms of the level of preparation for selling EC pills at pharmacies, 1067 (83.9％) respondents cited``lack of preparation of medical questionnaires and explanatory materials'', and 975 (76.7％) respondents cited``lack of knowledge of pharmacists'' as the most common reasons that were``barriers to EC pill sales at pharmacies''. In terms of conˆdence level, only 289 (22.7％) respondents were conˆdent about conducting the necessary checks while administering medicine. On the other hand, 944 (74.3％) respondents agreed to be able to sell EC pills at their pharmacies. The survey revealed that most of the pharmacists who participated in the survey believe that it is possible to sell EC pills in pharmacies.

## INTRODUCTION

Emergency contraceptive (EC) pills are a contraception method used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse. The World Health Organization has increased access to EC medicines as part of sexual and reproductive health and rights intervention. 1) Levonorgestrel, an EC pill, is highly eŠective when used immediately after intercourse, although it can be administered within 3 days of intercourse. 2) Furthermore, it has no severe side eŠects or teratogenicity. 3) EC pills are already available in pharmacies in more than 90 countries around the world. 4) In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Study Council for the Evaluation of Diversion from Medical Use to Guidance and OTC Use deter-mined in 2017 that the sale of EC pills in pharmacies was premature. Instead, telemedicine policy was to be implemented as a special exception, starting in 2020, and training had begun for pharmacies to deliver EC pills after telemedicine. However, it has been suspended in many areas due to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). 5,6) Citizens have signed a petition calling for the sale of EC pills at pharmacies. However, the presidents of the Japanese Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society of Obstetrics and Gynecological Medicine have expressed their cautious opinion towards it. 7 9) Against this background, the Cabinet O‹ce's Expert Committee on the Fifth Basic Plan suddenly announced that it would``consider selling EC pills at pharmacies without a prescription''. 10) On the other hand, pharmacies have just begun to respond to online medical treatment, and there has been little research on the level of preparation and awareness of pharmacists regarding the sale of EC pills at pharmacies. Therefore, we conducted a web survey to determine the level of preparation in community pharmacies and awareness of pharmacists regarding the sale of EC pills at pharmacies. 10) MATERIALS AND METHODS


## Research Design

Web-based cross-sectional survey Participants Inclusion criteria Community pharmacists who accessed the Kyoto University Pharmacy Informatics Group website and agreed to participate in this web survey.

Exclusion criteria Non-pharmacists, those who worked at the headquarters of pharmaceutical companies, those in charge of education, and those who work in hospitals.


## Recruitment of survey participants

We sent out survey-related information about EC pills selling via pharmacist-related web magazines and social networking services (SNS: Facebook and Twitter). Also, e-mails were sent to chain pharmaceutical companies and Japanese pharmaceutical associations, seeking their cooperation.


## Web-survey system

Respondents were asked a yes/no question about their workplace readiness to fulˆll EC pill prescriptions/sell EC pills and if they viewed it as an``obstacle to pharmacy sales''. To understand the``barriers to EC pill sales in pharmacies'', respondents were asked to agree or disagree with the following reasons: 1) lack of knowledge about EC pills among pharmacists, and 2) lack of explanatory materials. To determine their level of conˆdence on what should be done at the time of sale, respondents were asked about the following factors: 1) checking of customers' information, and 2) explanation of precautions. In both cases, respondents were asked to answer on 6-point Likert scales, each ranging from``1-completely disagree'' to``6-completely agree'', resulting in a total of 12 disability and conˆdence scores each. The knowledge score com-prisedˆve correct questionsone point per question leading to a total score ofˆve points. Similarly, attitudes toward the sale of EC pills in pharmacies were checked and scored on 6-point scale.

Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using STATA/SE 16.1 for Windows (Stata Corp LLC, College Station). Multiple regression analysis was performed by forced entry using the attitude score for EC pill sales in pharmacies (6 points) as the objective variable. The adjustment variables were gender (male, female), job title (manager, working pharmacist), access to information source (company contact, others), pharmacy preparedness (yes or no), and conˆdence score (12 points). The statistical signiˆcance level was set at 5％.

Ethical Considerations Consent was obtained from participants by mentioning a statement on the purpose of the study and checking a box for research data disclosure -``This is an anonymous survey, and no personally identiˆable information will be collected''. The research protocol was submitted to the Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee; as it was revealed that this study was opt-in and did not involve the collection of personal information, the review was not required (November 2, 2020).


## RESULTS

1338 respondents responded to the survey over 40 days from November 7, 2020, to December 16, 2020. Excluding 67 respondents who were not community pharmacists (head o‹ce workers, hospital pharmacists, pharmacy staŠ, doctors, etc.), 1271 respon-  Vol. 141, No. 11 (2021) dents were included in the analysis.

There were 759 (59.7％) female respondents. The job titles recorded were manager of pharmacists 625 (49.2％), full-timer 371 (29.2％), part-timer 183 (14.4％), and owner 48 (3.8％). The most common reason for participating in the web survey was contact from the company 896 (70.5％), trade publications and web magazines 157 (12.4％), and SNS 132 (10.4％), respectively ( Table 1).

In terms of the level of preparation for selling EC pills at pharmacies, 1067 (83.9％) respondents cited`l ack of preparation of medical questionnaires and explanatory materials'', and 975 (76.7％) respondents cited``lack of knowledge of pharmacists'' as the most common reasons that were``barriers to EC pill sales at pharmacies''. Speciˆcally, 839 (66.0％) respondents answered:``Totally agree'' to``Lack of explanatory materials'' ( Table 2). In terms of conˆdence level, only 289 (22.7％) respondents were condent about conducting the necessary checks at the time of administering medicine, and 300 (23.6％) respondents were conˆdent about explaining the required precautions at the time of selling EC pills. On the other hand, in terms of attitude, 944 (74.3％) respondents agreed to be able to sell EC pills at their pharmacies. The Japanese questions on the web survey are shown in Table 3.


## DISCUSSION

We conducted a survey on the readiness of pharmacies and the awareness of pharmacists regarding the sale of EC pills. Although the majority of pharmacists felt that they lacked the knowledge and explanatory materials required to sell EC pills at their pharmacies and did not have enough conˆdence in explaining and conducting checks while selling EC pills, three-fourths of the respondents agreed that they could sell EC pills at their pharmacies.

The sale of EC pills at pharmacies began in France in 2000, and in the UK, in the following year. 4) In a survey of pharmacists in the UK, before the start of EC pill sales, pharmacists at pharmacies complained about a lack of knowledge, which is consistent with this survey results. 11) In the UK, Ulipristal was approved in 2018. Ulipristal can prevent pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse comparing to Levonorgestrel that is required to be taken within 3 days after intercourse. Although approximately 40％ of customers were young people aged 16 20 years, there were no reports of multiple purchases, which was a concern earlier. Pharmacies have been reported to support users due to the convenience of obtaining EC pills in emergency situations. 12,13) These reports have much in common with the current concerns and issues in Japan.

While implementing the sale of EC pills in pharmacies, making inventory reporting mandatory and requiring pharmacists to check many points of sale to customers would suppress the number of pharmacies selling EC pills. Hence, to enable the maximum number of pharmacies to sell EC pills, which would improve citizens' access to them, it is necessary to not only strengthen regulations on pharmacies but also enhance the judgment capabilities of pharmacists in theˆeld and leave some measures to their discretion. Therefore, apart from the group training currently being provided by obstetricians and gynecologists, it is necessary to create explanatory materials that can be used in pharmacies as well as videos that can be viewed on the internet, such as those developed in this study, to enhance opportunities for pharmacists to acquire specialized knowledge. In an increasingly sophisticated healthcare environment, pharmacists need to develop an environment where they can demonstrate their capabilities in ensuring safe and appropriate delivery of medicines in society.
