Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) sensing utilization has been widespread, especially for human behavior/activity recognition.It provides high flexibility since it does not require the person/object to carry any device known as device-free.This "passive" concept is also helpful for another application of Wi-Fi sensing, i.e., indoor localization.The "sensing" is conducted using particular parameters extracted from communication links of Wi-Fi devices, i.e., Channel State Information (CSI).This paper explores the recent trends in CSI-based indoor localization with Wi-Fi technology as its core, including their advantages, challenges, and future directions.We found tremendous benefits can be gained by employing Wi-Fi sensing in localization supported by its performance and integrability for other intelligent systems for activity recognition.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Significant use of location-based service (LBS) has been to the point of needing indoor service coverage.After the COVID-19 pandemic passed, the increasing use of indoor activities has been the main drive in indoor LBS development.As the Global Positioning System (GPS) poorly provides sure accuracy, especially in indoor environments, indoor localization research is still in high demand [1].Indoor localization provides benefits when satellite signals are blocked, and GPS cannot work well.It also supports some applications, i.e., activity recognition, especially utilizing Radio -Frequency (RF) -based technology, e.g., Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), ZigBee, and ultrawideband (UWB) [2].The Wi-Fi technology, which is low-cost and widely available, is a promising technology for indoor localization.One recent trend in Wi-Fi-based research, especially on indoor localization, is exploring the sensing capabilities of Wi-Fi signal, or "Wi-Fi Sensing."[3]- [5] Wi-Fi technologies are available in almost any personal device, e.g., smartphones, tablets, and car gadgets.Wi-Fi sensing can be described as the utilization of Wi-Fi signal parameters to sense the environment, i.e., by observing the change in the channel properties known as Channel State Information (CSI), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Time-of-Flight (ToF), and Doppler effect analysis [5].In this survey, we focus on CSI-based Wi-Fi sensing because of its beneficial points in recognition of coarse-grained or fine-grained human activities, from the heartbeat signal low to high-moving types of activities.[6].

Unlike RSSI, which is prone to fluctuation, CSI gives a more accurate parameter representation since it comprises amplitude, phase, and power.The main drawback of CSI utilization is that this parameter could be more straightforward to obtain.However, notable work recently made the CSI more flexible and low-cost has been published [3].In addition to human activity recognition, the CSI parameter is also helpful for indoor localization parameters, especially the one usually defined as passive localization or device-free localization, which means that the objects or targets do not need to carry any devices to localize.

Several survey papers focus on indoor localization or Wi-Fi sensing for general purposes [3]- [7].In this paper, we present a survey on Wi-Fi sensing for indoor localization via CSI, which is highly flexible and identifies some challenges in its implementation.We expect to get insight, especially into the low-cost and straightforward setup in the recent development of CSI-based indoor localization.The papers cited for this survey are based on the latest findings related to Wi-Fi Sensing and CSI-based indoor localization.

We organize this survey paper: the first part introduces Wi-Fi sensing and indoor localization, followed by the Wi-Fi sensing theory and techniques.The third part will discuss the CSI in detail, followed by Wi-Fi-based indoor localization using CSI.The fifth to seventh part will focus on CSI-based indoor localization performance evaluation, challenges with future directions, and applications and case studies, respectively.


## II. WI-FI SENSING


## A. Wi-Fi Sensing Techniques

Ubiquitous Wi-Fi networks' coverage has become the primary spark in research on intelligent systems and the Internet of Things (IoT).Wi-Fi applications are generally popular from the desktop or personal computer connection to the internet.Recently, with the support of the advanced technology development and standard of IEEE 802.11, the applications of Wi-Fi sensing are now expanding to intrusion detection, virtual and augmented reality, healthcare, smart home, and indoor localization [5], [6].

This paper survey the application of Wi-Fi sensing on indoor localization system, especially for the most common techniques utilized by RSSI and CSI.These two parameters also usually come along as reasonable compensation for coarse-grained and fine-grained localization: 1) RSSI-based Technique: RSSI represents the power in the receiver.This parameter has the trait to be high in fluctuation due to environments and transmitting time.The parameter can be straightforwardly obtained by lowcost and less complex RF-based, especially Wi-Fi devices, both dedicated and infrastructure-based. RSSI can be applied to indoor localization for distance and distance-free techniques, trilateration, and fingerprint or radio maps.For its fast and straightforward implementation, RSSI is known for the best parameter selection for indoor localization.However, it poses some challenges, especially when the environment is highly dynamic [1].Most approaches are also device-based or conventional, where the target must carry a localization device.In addition to inflexibility, it also comes in cost when the system's scalability increases; some fluctuation due to the larger area of interest or more extended time in collecting data will degrade the overall system's accuracy as we concern only a few approaches using RSSI for passive localization (device-free) [8].

2) CSI-based Technique: Unlike RSSI, the main challenge of CSI is its data extraction or collection as it is channel model-based, and the signal parameters are pretty complex.Compared to RSSI, CSI needs some extension of hardware and software, for example, the Atheros CSI tools.CSI represents the multipath effects on the propagation mechanism of the transmission link.The main difference in features compared to RSSI is that CSI has information on phase, direction of signals (out and in), delay (flight time), and power or amplitude.Exploring CSI can open up opportunities, especially in changing those features when the position or activity of humans/objects changes in the area of interest.CSI is a top choice for device-free indoor localization [9], [10].

There are also some techniques in Wi-Fi sensing, e.g., ToF, where the main parameters are the traveling time of signals from the transmitter to the receivers and machine learning (ML).We will discuss using CSI, including its benefits, challenges/limitations, and prospective research directions.


## B. Wi-Fi Sensing vs. Other Localization Methods

Wi-Fi sensing employs the interaction between the Wi-Fi signals and a person/object inside an indoor environment to detect movement, track position, and even for the signal change in biological vital signs, i.e., breathing.The most fundamental advantage of Wi-Fi is that it is widely and readily available compared to other localization methods [11], [12]:

1) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): Detecting change in position, orientation, and acceleration, IMU emphasized using sensors, i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes.Unlike RF-based, the IMU-based localization method can work without signal infrastructure.However, in the long run, the accumulated device error can reduce performance.

2) Vision-based method: Camera and computer vision can reliably locate the target/object and recognize gestures and activities.The main drawback is related to the privacy-obstruction issue and is significantly affected by the magnetic field and calibration issues on preinstallation.Furthermore, the methods also need favorable lighting conditions.

3) Acoustics localization: Positioning based on its ToF by using sound or audio signal.This method is suitable in the industrial setting with many metal objects.The challenges are in noise reduction from surrounding environment acoustics properties.4) Magnetic-field-based: A magnetic field can estimate position based on signal strength and orientation.Because of magnetic fields, it can easily be affected by metallic objects and variations in magnetic fields in the area of interest.


## C. Wi-Fi Sensing Advantages and Limitations

The advantage of Wi-Fi sensing is its applicability in directly implementing the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure.It also gives an advantage in the deployment cost, finegrained localization (especially using CSI), can locate multi-target, non-intrusive (device-free), and adaptability to environmental change.However, some limitations must be considered in developing Wi-Fi sensing-based indoor localization [13].

The first limitation is related to the accuracy.One limitation of Wi-Fi infrastructure is its limited access.The collecting of Wi-Fi data can also raise privacy concerns.The Wi-Fi operates in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, as the operational frequency of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands is also in the same frequency band, which signal interference might happen [4].Other concerns are limited range, signal analysis complexity, and environmental variation.Thus, the selection of Wi-Fi parameters, the system design, scale, and the performance requirement need to be harmonized so that the indoor localization system can be reliable and accurate.The main advantages and limitations concerning its implementation are presented in Table 1.


## Table 1. Advantages and Limitations Wi-Fi Sensing


## Advantages Limitations

High-range resolution [13] Need user to keep moving [14] Wide coverage [13], [15] Multipath effects in NLoS [16] Reasonable Tx power [13] Not straightforward extraction [17] III.CHANNEL STATE INFORMATION

The core of channel state information (CSI) is representing the signal properties of wireless communication link to estimate the channel.CSI is widely used for human behavior/activity recognition since it can predict the behavior from fine to coarse-grained.However, in the beginning, some applications still used the traditional ways that attached the devices, predominantly sensor devices, e.g., temperature, humidity, accelerometer, for observing the changes of human condition yield on its behavior classification from recognition techniques/algorithms as seen in Figure 1.


## A. Introduction to CSI

The disadvantage of traditional methods is that the devices must be attached to the object.On the other hand, CSI uses the spectrum change of signal in communication link properties, e.g., amplitude, phase, time, and power, to detect the change and combine it with the specific technique to predict human behavior or activities.

For the non-intrusive nature of the human behavior system, CSI is essential and top choice.Moreover, in Wi-Fi devices, CSI can also be extracted.Another parameter of Wi-Fi can also be used, especially for indoor localization, i.e., received signal strength indicator (RSSI).However, this parameter is known for its high fluctuation in nature and is also accurate enough for coarse localization.CSI is a more "grained" metric than RSSI.CSI can describe amplitude attenuation and phase shift well, which can be used as the foundation of human behavior and lead to indoor localization implementations.Furthermore, CSI can effectively recognize the basic vital signs of complex actions human or inhabitants' activities.The illustration of CSI-based human behavior/activities, which can also be further extended as the indoor localization scenario, is depicted in Figure 2. It also depicts that the target/object does not need to carry any device (device-free).The multipath effects caused by the person's activities can be represented as propagation mechanisms, e.g., reflection, diffraction, and scattering.Reflection is reflected signal from human and surrounding interactive objects (IOs), while diffraction is diffracted signal from the surfaces, while scattering is signals scattered by small objects or sharp edges IOs [6].

The core of CSI is multipath propagation, especially in an indoor environment where the signal extensively experiences these multipath effects.For instance, giving that  is the number of different path signals traveling from TX/Access Points (APS) to RX/Station (STA).From these different paths, the signal and delay attenuation at  th path are described as   and   , respectively.The frequency response of the channel ℎ() then can be expressed as [5]
ℎ(𝑓) = ∑ 𝛼 𝑙 𝑒 −𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑡 𝑙 𝐿 𝑙  ()
with f as the center frequency.

CSI is a metric that describes the channel properties of wireless communication links and considers the several factors affecting signal propagation, such as signal scatter, environmental attenuation, and distance attenuation.In the matrix form, Eq. ( 1) can also be expressed as
𝒀 = 𝑯𝑿 + 𝑵  ()
 is received signal vector,  is transmitted signal vector,  is channel matrix presented in CSI format, and  is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).Accordingly,  can be expressed as  = |()| ∠() .


## B. Importance of CSI in Wi-Fi Sensing for Indoor Localization

As CSI is the channel state information between transmitter and receiver, it poses a significant role in indoor localization methods.As it includes the signal's phase, amplitude, and frequency of the received signals, it can contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the indoor localization system.Some contributions of CSI for indoor localization are mentioned as follows [3], [5], [6].


## 1) Fine-grain information

Compared to RSSI, in which power is the average value from all considered paths, the CSI can be detailed even on individual paths.As previously mentioned, CSI provides detailed information on several propagation mechanisms and allows precisely the physical environment understanding and location of objects within the enclosed area of interest.


## 2) Spatial diversity

As the signal takes various paths traveling from transmitter to receiver, CSI can harness the spatial diversity for accurately locating the objects between the transmission links.


## 3) Mitigation of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS)

The complex shape and layout of the indoor environment often lead to the unavailability of the Line of Sight (LoS), which will degrade some signal parameters, e.g., direction, time, and power.CSI can assist in identifying the NLoS paths and enabling algorithms to correct the impact on the localization process.


## 4) Dynamic environment

As a result of NLoS mitigation, CSI also provides real-time updates on the change of environment.This dynamic information is helpful for the localization process since it allows the fast adaptation of the localization system.


## 5) Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The particular features of CSI data are suitable as input in almost all modern ML and AI models.They allow flexibility and high performance based on the available data and help extract meaningful data patterns for localization.


## 6) Privacy and security

One feature of CSI that is helpful in localization system is the flexibility in use on the considered devices, which reduces the privacy and concerns about transmitting location information to the external servers.


## 7) Multi-modal sensing

This feature will benefit from the compensation of using other parameters, e.g., RSSI, Time-of-Flight (ToF), and event physical sensors, for creating a multi-modal localization system.The data fusion from these parameters can help to improve indoor localization performance.The CSI data collection can be achieved by many devices ranging from low-cost and straightforward to sophisticated yet reliable.Some devices used for CSI data collection are listed in Table 2. Packet capture is done by generally employing the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channel via Atheros CSI tool, then extracted to be readable parameters, e.g., phase, amplitude, and frequency of the received signal.Like other localization parameters, the preprocessing stage progresses through filtering and noise reduction.After pre-processing, we have to limit the data by feature extraction, i.e., reducing the data dimensionally.


## C. CSI-based Indoor Localization Process

The process is then continued by the localization algorithm, classical, geometrical, or ML-based models.Two essential processes: training to establish a relationship between CSI and actual positions.At the same time, calibration is needed to tune the algorithms and parameters.The multi-modal process is optional, where the localization system comprises several parameters.CSI is a very dynamic parameter and needs to be updated to ensure the performance of the localization process.This real-time update affects the CSI signal and its representation of locations.The last step is to estimate the location as the localization output.


## IV. CSI LOCALIZATION TECHNIQUES

Indoor localization is the process of finding the location of an object or target in a closed indoor environment.By utilizing Wi-Fi sensing, it falls to the influence of Wi-Fi signal propagation forming specific patterns, which further we can develop the Wi-Fi fingerprint.This part will discuss this "fingerprint" by using CSI.


## A. Classification of CSI Fingerprint

CSI fingerprints are commonly used for two primary purposes: activity recognition and indoor localization.For example, there are falling detection for elderly care, biological keystrokes, and hand-sign for computer interaction.This survey paper focuses on indoor localization, where CSI fingerprints are collected based on the target/object locations and then further trained in the classification to determine those target locations.

For this "classifier," there are three main popular approaches: statistical, building datasets, and deep learning [25].


## 1) Statistical

The classifiers apply statistical values, e.g., mean, median, mode, entropy, as features, i.e., to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM).This statistical-based requires a well-understanding related feature design, especially for localization determination.


## 2) Building datasets

The first step is to build a dataset with a CSI fingerprint.For example, in the case of Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) + k Nearest Neighbors (kNN), the approach needs to provide all distances from all tests and all samples within the dataset.The process will require more time and complexity than a pre-training type of classifier.


## 3) Deep learning (DL)

Generally, DL is a subset of machine learning that is fed by more significant and more complex datasets.Moreover, the networks and hyperparameters are also "deeper" in terms of design and further analysis and training.In terms of computation complexity, the depth of neural networks is concerned.Several DL models are used for classifiers, e.g., Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), ResNet, Inception, or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the CSI fingerprint classifier.


## B. DL-based Indoor Localization using CSI [9] 1) Generative Deep Learning

The first introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been a significant breakthrough in the popularity of "Generative AI" followed by ChatGPT, Dall-E, and MidJourney.The concept of generative AI is to generate new data based on the input or learned data.It is showing that DL can have an imagination.In this paper context, the generated CSI from generative AI is helpful because data is gold.


## 2) Discriminative Deep Learning

Unlike generative models, discriminative DL is mainly used for classification purposes, i.e., CNN.


## V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS

This section delves into the essential metrics utilized for evaluation, followed by a discussion of experimental configurations and the publicly available CSI dataset.We want to find the answer to the general metric in CSI-based localization.


## A. Metrics evaluation of Wi-Fi-based localization systems

In the following, we define the most common metrics in papers for Wi-Fi-based localization systems using CSI.These metrics guarantee the reliability, practicality, and widespread feasibility of constructing indoor localization systems.


## 1) Accuracy and Precision

Accuracy is the measurement of the distance between the estimated position and the actual one, while precision involves the closeness of a quantity in repetitive measurements across different instances.Accuracy signifies that the spread of outcomes remains consistent across multiple trials.Various factors like noise, obstacles, and multipath effects influence these.Consequently, it becomes crucial for the system to mitigate the influence of elements that diminish accuracy [1].An indoor localization system is considered reliable when it demonstrates high accuracy and precision.Thus, many research papers mainly concentrate on enhancing accuracy through diverse methods [26].


## 2) Complexity and cost

Complexity is an important parameter that should be appropriately managed while designing the localization algorithms [27].Practical implementation demands reduced complexity and cost, leading to acceptable levels of accuracy and precision [28].Thus, by maintaining lower complexity and cost, indoor positioning systems can achieve widespread utilization [29].Consequently, complexity emerges as an essential aspect in realizing the real-world deployment of indoor positioning.


## 3) Availability and Scalability

A fundamental prerequisite for indoor localization is utilizing a readily available technology on user devices that does not necessitate extra hardware.The availability of such technology significantly influences scalability, allowing for the expansion or reduction of system nodes and geographic coverage.Currently, Wi-Fi is the predominant technology accessible on most users' devices.However, the existing Wi-Fi mobile devices lack support for extracting CSI, necessitating additional hardware.


## B. Experiment setups and datasets

For evaluation purposes, essential components of the experimental setup include the configuration of access points (APs) and receivers.Various studies concerning indoor localization using Wi-Fi have utilized dedicated hardware such as Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300 Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Network Interface Card (NIC), Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 Software Defined Radio (SDR), and chipsets like Atheros AR9390 or Atheros AR9580 [30], [31] The initial phase of developing a fingerprint-based localization technique involves the acquisition of a radio map.Various aspects of the radio map, such as the distance between reference points (RPs), the number of RPs used for training, or the positions of target points (TPs) concerning RPs, will impact the algorithm's performance.The authors in [32] provide the open CSI datasets for localization.


## VI. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS


## A. Challenges and limitations

CSI-based indoor localization can provide higher accuracy than RSSI utilization up to a centimeter scale.

However, this also has several disadvantages related to hardware requirements, signal data characteristics, and dynamic environment calibration.


## 1) Hardware requirements

Wi-Fi-based CSI indoor localization relies on accessing CSI data from the user's device.Despite the prevalence of Wi-Fi networks in various buildings, collecting CSI data is challenging because common smartphones do not have CSI extraction capabilities [33], and obtaining such data may demand specialized devices like channel sounders or software-defined radios [34], which can be expensive to implement.


## 2) Signal complexity

Signal reflections, interference, and multipath fading contribute to the difficulty of accurately retrieving signal information.CSI-based indoor localization algorithms often exhibit complexity, requiring significant training data.This complexity presents challenges for costeffective and streamlined deployment.Furthermore, the high-dimensional characteristics of signal data can also interfere with the practical training of machine learning approaches [33], [35].


## 3) Dynamic environment

Indoor environments are dynamic, with objects and people moving around [31].This dynamic nature can lead to rapid changes in patterns over time, which can also cause the CSI to vary [36].This variation can make it challenging to maintain accurate localization over time.


## B. Potential solutions and advancements

There are related potential solutions for each of the difficulties and limitations that CSI-based indoor localization faces.Currently, various research is in progress aiming to create smartphone hardware capable of CSI data extraction such as in [37].These advancements could make CSI-based indoor localization more attainable and economically viable.Although conventional smartphones lack built-in CSI extraction capabilities, collaborative work between device manufacturers and researchers could lead to the integration of CSI-based hardware.Investigating low-cost strategies for integrating specialized devices is an additional option to consider.This concerted effort to enhance hardware capabilities could pave the way for broader utilization of CSI-based indoor localization.

The robustness enhancement in CSI-based algorithms can be achieved by developing sophisticated signal processing methodologies that effectively address signal reflections, interference, and multipath fading.Strategies such as beamforming, wavelet analysis, and noise mitigation can play a crucial role in refining CSI data, consequently increasing the accuracy of indoor localization.Additionally, machine learning holds great promise for strengthening CSI-based algorithms against difficulties because of the capacity of machine learning techniques to comprehend the complicated correlation between CSI and the user's location, even in complex scenarios.By using machine learning's adaptability, algorithms can more effectively adapt to the complex requirements of CSI-based indoor localization, producing higher performance results [38].

In response to the dynamic nature of indoor environments, implementing adaptive algorithms that dynamically recalibrate in response to real-time fluctuations emerges as a promising solution [39].Adopting machine learning models with the capacity to quickly adjust to changing CSI patterns has the potential to maintain accuracy in the face of environmental changes.Developing novel algorithms aims to monitor alterations in the surroundings proficiently and subsequently finetune localization strategies.This ground-breaking method aims to guarantee consistent and accurate localization, even in dynamic and constantly changing environments, thereby improving the application and reliability of CSIbased indoor localization systems.


## VII. CONCLUSION

In this survey, we comprehensively overview Wi-Fi Sensing for Indoor Localization.We introduce the Wi-Fi sensing localization approaches, focusing on the most popular ones that use CSI and RSSI for localization.We comprehensively introduce CSI with a focus on Wi-Fi sensing localization.To develop localization algorithms, we also provide the performance evaluation, which includes evaluation measures, experiment setups, and the public dataset.In our final section, we highlight the difficulties CSI-based positioning faces and suggest some potential future possibilities.The methods utilized in Wi-Fi-based indoor localization can be understood, used, and developed using the information in this paper.
