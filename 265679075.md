Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in Indonesia is increasingly complex for various reasons.The quantity of solid waste is expected to increase substantially due to an increasing population and rapid urbanization.Each municipality in Indonesia has a distinct technique and method to manage solid waste, depending on the peculiarities and problems.Cities and regencies have different characteristics.Research on municipal solid waste management conducted in regency areas is still limited.This study aims to investigate the implementation of MSWM in Indonesian regency areas.This study is based on a literature review and the relevant policies, but it also incorporates simple statistical analysis to support the points and arguments in this paper.The review found differences characteristic of MSWM in regency areas and city areas, such as waste generation, waste composition, and source of waste.MSWM solutions vary according to each municipality and rely heavily on local governments' commitment and their financial, technical, and institutional capacity.The existing waste problem must be addressed holistically from upstream to downstream with a 'cradle-to-grave' mindset to create tangible advances in Indonesia's solid waste management.

## Introduction

Indonesia is one of Southeast Asia's largest economies, comprised of 34 provinces, 17.500 islands, and around 1.890.000km 2 total area.According to the latest Census of Indonesia in 2020, the population of Indonesia in 2020 was 270 million, which makes Indonesia the fourth most populated nation in the world.Meanwhile, according to published statistics, Indonesia's population increased by 3.26 million people, or 1.25% each year, from 2010 to 2020 [1].Since the country's average output of municipal solid waste has grown from 0.8 kg per capita to 2.1 kg per capita over the last decade, the country has become exposed to environmental effects.With an increasing population, Indonesia is also a growing economy with an average annual economic growth rate of 5.3 percent from 2000 until 2019 (Figure 1).Despite the fact that the COVID-19 epidemic reduced Indonesia's real GDP growth from 5% in Q4 2019 to 0% in 2020, it is expected to rise to 4.8% in 2021 and 6% in 2022 [2].Population growth and increased resource use imply an increase in waste generated by the population.As a result, one of Indonesia's most pressing concerns today is managing the exponentially expanding volumes of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated.1979-1984. Following this, 1990 the Indonesian Environmental Impact Management Agency was founded, and in 1989, the government launched an award program for the city with the cleanest environment, named Adipura.In its development of conducting waste management in Indonesia, the Indonesian government has made various policies regarding waste management, such as Law 18/2008 about waste management, Law 32/2009 about environmental protection and management, Government Regulation 81/2012 about domestic waste and domestic waste equivalent management, Presidential Regulation 97/2017 about national policy and strategy for domestic waste and domestic waste equivalent management, known as Jakstranas, as well as various regulations issued by each region in Indonesia for waste management.

Each municipality in Indonesia has a distinct technique and method to manage solid waste, depending on the peculiarities and problems of each municipality.Numerous issues have been explored in studies on MSWM in Indonesian cities.Previous research has looked at how Indonesian municipalities tackle waste issues from a variety of perspectives, including sustainability, leadership, management, environmental education, community engagement, social factors, and technology [4][5][6][7].Most of the research focuses on explaining certain methods and approaches to managing waste in city areas, while discussion in the regency area is still limited.

This research was conducted in regency areas in Indonesia to address this gap in research.A regency is an administrative division typically covering a larger geographical area, including urban and rural areas.It is also known as a district or county in some regions.Regencies are usually located outside of major cities and can encompass multiple towns, villages, or other smaller settlements.Cities and regencies have different characteristics.That makes solid waste management in regency areas distinguishable from that in cities. Regencies have larger areas than cities and have a more even population distribution.That causes waste management in the regency area very complex and particularly challenging because of its extensive service area.


## Methods

Deli Serdang is a regency located in North Sumatra province and directly adjacent to Medan city.Deli Serdang has 2 sanitary landfills.Deli Serdang is one of the National Strategic Areas based on Indonesia Presidential Regulation 62/2011.It is located on the eastern coast of Sumatra and covers an area of approximately 2,497.72 km 2 or 249,772 Ha, and it consists of 22 sub-districts and 394 villages.According to Deli Serdang Central Bureau of Statistics data, the Deli Serdang population in 2018 was 2,155,625 people, 1,084,679 men and 1,070,946 women with 1,04,955 households, and about four people inhabited each household.

This research is a descriptive qualitative review.The data and information are obtained by reviewing the related literature and policies.Research and discussion references related to regency municipal solid waste management are gathered under the specific theme of comparing it with city's municipal solid waste management.Municipal solid waste management in regency areas is synthesized from a currentcondition perspective in Deli Serdang regency.


## Results and Discussions


### Waste generation in Deli Serdang Regency

Understanding waste generation and solid waste composition might be deemed critical in planning and developing MSWM strategies [8] [9].Solid waste generation was found to be different because there were different levels of consumption patterns in different locations, respectively indicating that the factors affecting the environmental aspects of solid waste management in developing countries are the lack of environmental control systems and real impact evaluation [10].The consequences of excessive waste generation are significant and can adversely affect the environment and human health.Improper municipal solid waste management may result in pollution of land, water, and air, which contributes to climate change, habitat destruction, and disease transmission.Based on SIPSN data, in 2021, waste generation in Deli Serdang regency reached 408,129.86 tons/year, which is still smaller than Medan city, which has a population of around 2.4 million people.Solid waste generation in the regency area in Indonesia is still smaller than in cities (Figure 2).That can happen due to several factors: population, rate of consumption, socio-economic, climatic conditions, food habits, lifestyle, economic activities, level of technology, urbanization, culture and tradition, literacy level, local regulations related to waste, usage behavior, and recoverability.


### Source of waste in Deli Serdang Regency

MSW is typically generated from a range of sources where various human activities occur.According to various studies, households generate most of the MSW in developing countries (55-80%), followed by market or commercial sectors (10-30%).[11].composed of varied amounts created by industry, roadways, institutions, and several other elements.Data on waste sources can help define the goal of MSWM.Based on SIPSN data 2021, Figure 3 shows the proportion of waste sources in Deli Serdang Regency and Medan city.The sources of waste varied slightly between the regency area and the city area.Households are the largest waste generators in Deli Serdang regency and Medan city at 43%, and differences can be seen from other sources, such as the market.Traditional markets in regency areas generate more waste than those in city areas because traditional markets are frequented in city areas, and residents in city areas prefer to visit supermarkets and contemporary marketplaces.A similar effect is found for offices in cities that create a higher proportion of solid waste than offices in regencies.Due to the number and complexity of operations in city commercial areas, city commercial areas create a greater percentage of MSW than regency commercial areas.


### Waste composition in Deli Serdang Regency

Waste composition information is critical for MSWM planning and decision-making [12].Figure 4 shows the differences in the composition of solid waste in regency and city areas.The fundamental difference in waste composition between regencies and cities is the percentage of food waste.City areas produce more food waste because consumption patterns and lifestyles differ from those of regency areas.

In Deli Serdang, a lot of food waste is still processed back into compost and used as animal feed by most of the population working as farmers and ranchers.Hence, the food waste composition in Deli Serdang regency is less than in Medan city.


### Waste collection and transportation system in Deli Serdang Regency

Previous research found that improper waste collection systems, bad route design, a lack of knowledge regarding collection schedules, inadequate infrastructure, poor roads, and a lack of waste collection facilities all had an impact on waste collection and transportation practices [13][14][15].In general, Indonesia's waste collection and transport systems are quite similar.The frequency of transfers and the size and type of trucks are determined by the amount of waste generated and the local government's financial resources.MSWM in Deli Serdang is managed by the local government.At the source, there are no distinct types of MSW separated, they are all put into a bag and dumped in solid waste facilities.MSWs are collected every day in all Deli Serdang regency areas.In Medan city, those responsible for waste collection and transportation are the Cleanliness and Gardening Agency, different from Deli Serdang Regency.In Deli Serdang, the head of sub-districts (Camat) is responsible for waste collection and transporting from household to the landfill.That was done because Deli Serdang has a very wide area, so the placement of truck depots at each sub-district office is considered more efficient for transporting waste from households to landfills.In Deli Serdang, MSW is collected by door-to-door trucking service, as shown in Figure 5, from households directly to the landfill; from households transported to the communal container and then transported to the landfill; and from households transported to TPS3R then the residual waste is transported to the landfill.


### Reduce, reuse, and recycle activities in Deli Serdang Regency

Local governments in Indonesia have yet to be able to implement the 3R system in MSWM even though Law 18/2008 about waste management had mandated it 15 years ago.Law No. 18/2008 aims to improve environmental quality and public health while also making waste a resource with economic potential.The law emphasizes the government's 3Rs policy.In addition, the law specifies that waste management is the joint duty of all parties, including individuals, communities, businesses, and the government.Law No. 18/2008 directives on waste management at the source as early as feasible and considering waste with economic potential may be satisfied by establishing Material Recovery Facilities (MRF) in Indonesia, known as TPS-3R and TPST [16].3R in the Deli Serdang regency is limited to concepts, discourse, socialization, and campaigns.Indonesia's central government's 3R activities have reached the local government, including implementation and waste bank promotion.The local government of Deli Serdang also always tries to make innovations in conducting socialization and campaigns for implementing 3R, such as conducting door-to-door 3R socialization, conducting forum group discussions (FGD) about 3R in sub-districts and villages, conducting 3R socialization at religious events, etc (Figure 6).In addition to the formal sector, the informal sector is critical to MSWM activities [17] in Deli Serdang.Communities and scavengers drive the informal sector.The community intends to educate households on minimizing and separating recyclable waste and economic potential waste at the source.The waste bank will purchase recyclable waste that has been sorted from households.Waste banks will sort it 6 further before selling it to recycling companies.Scavengers are there due to commercial motivation in finding valuable recyclable waste.Scavengers sell recyclable waste to waste collectors.From the waste collector, recyclable waste is sold to recycling companies.Scavengers may be found anywhere, including residential areas, communal containers, and even landfills.


### MSWM problems in Deli Serdang

Regency MSWM in Indonesia is increasingly complex for various reasons.The quantity of MSW is expected to increase substantially due to an increasing population and rapid urbanization.There are still many municipalities that do not have their own landfill, this generally occurs in cities due to the unavailability of land.Developing a phased technical and legal framework for waste management is necessary as a first step in addressing MSWM issues.In addition to implementing MSWM policies, a legal framework is also required.Many studies try to document how an adequate legal framework positively contributes to the development of an integrated municipal solid waste management system.A well-defined legal framework can aid effective implementation.The legal framework should also include an effective law enforcement system.

In general, the coverage of services provided by municipalities in Indonesia is insufficient, notably in low-income and/or slum neighborhoods with limited roadways or in remote suburban areas [18].Deli Serdang has a very wide area, which makes the efficiency of waste collection and waste transportation must be a top priority for the Deli Serdang government in carrying out MSWM.The efficiency of waste collection and transportation must be improved by increasing the coverage of collection areas [19], and cost-effective transportation with a scheduled collection system [20].Increasing the coverage of the collection area can reduce the amount of waste disposed of improperly, such as illegal dumping and open waste burning.

Inadequate MSWM facilities are an issue in most Indonesian municipalities [21].Deli Serdang experiences similar problems as most Indonesian municipalities.That is caused by institutional and financial issues.Deli Serdang government needs to increase the allocation of local government budget funds for MSWM, along with alternative funding from the private sector through Public Private Partnership schemes.The government should also immediately consider the participation of the business sector as part of the company's responsibility for the product waste they produce through the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program and also consider alternative financing by enactment and enforcement of tourist waste tax.


## Conclusion

This paper aimed to compare MSWM in regency areas with city areas and identify the current conditions and challenges of MSWM practices in regency areas in Indonesia.Waste composition in regency and city areas has a different composition, especially food waste.Cities and regencies have different characteristics, which makes MSWM in regency areas different from in city areas.The solid waste problem in Indonesia is complicated, and there is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution because problems vary according to each municipality and rely heavily on the local government's commitment, as well as their financial, technical, and institutional capabilities.The existing waste problem must be addressed holistically from upstream to downstream with a 'cradle-to-grave' mindset in order to create tangible advances in Indonesia's solid waste management.
