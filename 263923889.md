with data on body mass index (BMI) and self-reported comorbidities from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2005-2014.Logistic regression was used to quantify the association between BMI categories (<18.5, 18.5-24.9,25-29.9,≥30 kg/m2) and multimorbidity (yes/no).Change in proportions of obesity coexisting with multimorbidity by year was tested through linear regression.All analysis used NHANES survey design and weighting to be representative of the US population.The overall proportion of individuals with concomitant multimorbidity and obesity was 75%.As compared to a normal BMI (18.5-24.9kg/m2), older adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) had higher odds of multimorbidity (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.49,2.12).Persons with obesity had higher odds of decline in physical (1.41 [1.06,1.88]),basic (1.56 [1.13,2.15]),and instrumental activities of daily living (OR 1.58 [1.03,2.40]).The proportion of individuals with obesity and multimorbidity increased over time, but did not reach significance (β = 0.008, p=0.051).These results emphasize the role of obesity as a contributing factor to the burden of multimorbidity among older adults and underscore the importance of identifying and addressing obesity and multimorbidity via interventions to decrease obesity prevalence.


PANDEMIC-INSPIRED STRATEGIES FOR CROSS-SECTOR COLLABORATION ON FOOD EQUITY ACROSS THE LIFESPAN Joan Ilardo, and Angela Zell, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, East Lansing, Michigan, United States

Early during the pandemic, access to food by residents across the lifespan was problematic in many communities.We observed well-intentioned responses by community organizations but a lack of centralized coordination across sectors, even as donations and resources significantly increased.Most of the organizations were in various sectors and not aware of the efforts and capabilities of others causing duplication or gaps in services.To prepare for future emergencies, our team created a project to develop and pilot a user-friendly, evidence-based roadmap to guide communities through the process of developing and sustaining effective collaborative partnerships for food and nutrition-related problems they could address together.We will describe the process through which we developed the roadmap structure and recruited stakeholders and content experts for our advisory board.To determine the effectiveness of our interventions, we designed methods with which we can analyze the organizations willing to use the roadmap and participate in the collaborative partnership; how they implement the roadmap; and ways they cope with challenges they face during implementation using strategies in the roadmap.We will describe elements of an effective, efficient roadmap development process using as many currently available evidence-based resources as possible and creating evidence-informed resources when we identify gaps.Expected outcomes are: 1) format of the final roadmap; 2) types of groups willing to use it; 3) how well the roadmap was implemented; 4) feasibility of continued use of the roadmap by groups over the long term; and 5) potential to expand roadmap use to other communities.


PERCEIVED STRESS AND LIFE STRESSORS IN ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT FIBROMYALGIA

Ha Nguyen, Courtney Buck, Barbara Cherry, and Laura Zettel-Watson, California State University, Fullerton, F## ullerton, California, United States Fibromyalgia (FM) is a widespread chronic pain condition often accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as depression, which may impact perception of stress severity.The current study examined perceived stress and life stressors in adults ages 50 and older with and without FM.It was hypothesized that individuals with FM and/or depression would subjectively rate stressors as more severe than those without.Ninety-four participants (52% with FM, 78% female) aged 50 to 93 (M = 67.72,SD = 9.26) were administered the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure perception of stress and an updated version of the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) to assess stressors (i.e., major life events).The difference between the SRRS predetermined values and participants' subjective ratings was calculated.Difference scores indicated that self-reported severity exceeded standardized values.Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that older adults and men were less likely to report exaggerated stress severity.Controlling for age and gender, individuals with FM were significantly more likely to report stress severity far above standardized severity scores.Both depression and chronic pain impact stress ratings, but when controlling for the former, FM impact was no longer significant, suggesting that the impact is significantly greater for depression.Results also found a significant interaction between FM status and depression for perceived stress, but not for life event stressors, which may further emphasize the distinctions between the two measures.The findings underline the importance of assessing different types of stress and stressors in individuals with chronic pain and other related comorbidities.


SARCOPENIC OBESITY IN OLDER ADULTS: FINDINGS FROM THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY

Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, BALTIMORE, Maryland, United States, 3. University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States Sarcopenic obesity increases risk for dysmobility and loss of independence, (Gandham et al., 2021).However, the national burden of sarcopenic obesity and the resultant impacts for older adults has yet to be described.Within a nationally representative sample from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), 2066 communitydwelling older adults were obese, representing 12,136,374 individuals in the United States, or 31.8% of all community dwelling older adults.Based on the European Working Group definition, 18% of the obese older adults were sarcopenic.Sarcopenic obese older adults were more likely to have fallen in the last month and been hospitalized over the prior year.After adjusting for age and sex, sarcopenic obese older adults were 3.7 times more likely (95% CI 2.2-5.0) to have 2 or more comorbid conditions and frailty was 6.4 times more likely (95% CI 4.4-9.5)compared to nonsarcopenic obese older adults.Sarcopenic obese older adults were also more likely to have 1+ ADL disabilities (OR 3.7; 95% CI 2.5-5.4).Further, they were more likely to be socially isolated (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.3-3.2) and report food insecurity (OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.8-2.9).These findings suggest older adults with obesity and sarcopenia have higher rates of geriatric vulnerabilities, which might indicate a need for caution when recommending weight loss alone as an intervention.A more comprehensive intervention may be necessary to address social and physiological risks.Future studies should examine whether early intervention in sarcopenic obese older adults can reduce chronic health risk and preserve independence.

Ha Nguyen, Courtney Buck, Barbara Cherry, and Laura Zettel-Watson, California State University, Fullerton, Fullerton, California, United States Fibromyalgia (FM) is a widespread chronic pain condition often accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as depression, which may impact perception of stress severity.The current study examined perceived stress and life stressors in adults ages 50 and older with and without FM.It was hypothesized that individuals with FM and/or depression would subjectively rate stressors as more severe than those without.Ninety-four participants (52% with FM, 78% female) aged 50 to 93 (M = 67.72,SD = 9.26) were administered the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure perception of stress and an updated version of the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) to assess stressors (i.e., major life events).The difference between the SRRS predetermined values and participants' subjective ratings was calculated.Difference scores indicated that self-reported severity exceeded standardized values.Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that older adults and men were less likely to report exaggerated stress severity.Controlling for age and gender, individuals with FM were significantly more likely to report stress severity far above standardized severity scores.Both depression and chronic pain impact stress ratings, but when controlling for the former, FM impact was no longer significant, suggesting that the impact is significantly greater for depression.Results also found a significant interaction between FM status and depression for perceived stress, but not for life event stressors, which may further emphasize the distinctions between the two measures.The findings underline the importance of assessing different types of stress and stressors in individuals with chronic pain and other related comorbidities.


## SARCOPENIC OBESITY IN OLDER ADULTS: FINDINGS FROM THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY

Kathleen Dondero, 1 Jason Falvey, 1 Brock Beamer, 2 and Odessa Addison, 3 , 1. University of Maryland -Baltimore, Baltimore, Maryland, United States, 2. Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, BALTIMORE, Maryland, United States, 3. University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States Sarcopenic obesity increases risk for dysmobility and loss of independence, (Gandham et al., 2021).However, the national burden of sarcopenic obesity and the resultant impacts for older adults has yet to be described.Within a nationally representative sample from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), 2066 communitydwelling older adults were obese, representing 12,136,374 individuals in the United States, or 31.8% of all community dwelling older adults.Based on the European Working Group definition, 18% of the obese older adults were sarcopenic.Sarcopenic obese older adults were more likely to have fallen in the last month and been hospitalized over the prior year.After adjusting for age and sex, sarcopenic obese older adults were 3.7 times more likely (95% CI 2.2-5.0) to have 2 or more comorbid conditions and frailty was 6.4 times more likely (95% CI 4.4-9.5)compared to nonsarcopenic obese older adults.Sarcopenic obese older adults were also more likely to have 1+ ADL disabilities (OR 3.7; 95% CI 2.5-5.4).Further, they were more likely to be socially isolated (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.3-3.2) and report food insecurity (OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.8-2.9).These findings suggest older adults with obesity and sarcopenia have higher rates of geriatric vulnerabilities, which might indicate a need for caution when recommending weight loss alone as an intervention.A more comprehensive intervention may be necessary to address social and physiological risks.Future studies should examine whether early intervention in sarcopenic obese older adults can reduce chronic health risk and preserve independence.


## SOCIAL SUPPORT AND LIVING SITUATION OF OLDER ADULTS WITH HIP-FRACTURE:

A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY Alexandra Krassikova, 1 Steven Stewart, 2 Jennifer Bethell, 3 Aileen Davis, 4 and Katherine McGilton, 5 , 1. University of Toronto, Univerity of Toronto,Ontario,Canada,2.

University of Toronto,University of Toronto,Ontario,Canada,University Health Network,Toronto,Ontario,Canada Sustaining a hip-fracture is a life-changing event negatively affecting older adults.Although, social support is a known determinant of health outcomes, the relationship between social support and living situation of older adults with hip fracture remains under researched.For this study social support is conceptualized using the Finfgeld-Connett framework, where social support is seen as being composed of emotional and instrumental support.The objectives were to examine the relationship between two domains of social support and living situation: 1) after discharge; 2) 3-months after discharge; and 3) 6-months after discharge from an inpatient rehabilitation facility in a sample of older adults with hip fracture.Emotional support was measured as frequency of interaction with someone one week prior to hip fracture, whereas instrumental support was measured as help received in instrumental activities of daily living.Logistic regression was performed to examine the association between social support and living situation.Majority of study participants (N=139) were older (mean age 81.31), female (77.70%), had no cognitive impairment (68.35%), were not married (58.99%), and lived with someone (51.80%) in their own house (71.95%).Older adults with more emotional support were more likely to be discharged home, however little can be said about the effect of the association (OR 6.80, 95% CI 1.08, 22.31, P<.001).Persons receiving more instrumental support had less odds of living at home 3-months (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21, 0.78; P=.007) and 6-months after discharge (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38, 0.91, P=0.017).Social support is important for older adults during recovery.

The rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among older adults is an increasing concern in the U.S. and is expected to nearly triple within the next 40 years.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of Medicare Annual Wellness Visits (AWV) utilization on the management of DM among Medicare beneficiaries using data from 26,703 Medicare beneficiaries seen at 13 primary care community clinics (clinic visits between 2017 and 2019).A total of 34% of Medicare beneficiaries participated in an AWV.The total sample was, on average, 72.6 years old (SD=7.0),57% female, 84% White, and 91% non-Hispanic and had between zero and three co-morbid conditions.The AWV group was significantly younger (mean difference 2.0 years; p<.001) and had fewer comorbid conditions (mean difference 0.1; p<.001) than the non-AWV group at their initial visits.Comparing AWV and non-AWV groups at the first patient visit and last patient visit, there were significantly fewer patients with DM in the AWV group compared to the non-AWV groups (19.2% vs. 24.7%;p<.001 and 53.5% vs. 59.2%;p<.001).DM management was better in the AWV group compared to the non-AWV group at both the first and last patient visits, as exhibited by lower A1C levels (M= 5.9(SD=0.8)vs. M=6.2(SD=1.1);p<.001 and M= 6.6(SD=0.8) vs. M=6.9(SD=1.4);p=.013), lower glucose levels (M=114.0(SD=34.0)vs. M=123.0(SD=51.0);p<.001), and fewer DM medications (M=0.1(SD=.4) vs. M=0.2(SD=0.5);p<.001 and M=0.2(SD=0.6) vs. M=0.3(SD=0.6);p<.001).These results suggest that AWV are effective managing diabetes in older adults Medicare beneficiaries.

## AGING IN PLACE (BSS POSTER) DISPARITIES IN BASIC HOUSING NEEDS AS A PREDICTOR OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AMONG OLDER ADULTS

Meghan Custis, 1 Jeongeun Lee, 2 and Natasha Peterson, 3  Adequate housing and safe environments are among older adults' foundational needs.Prior research suggests minority older adults face significant barriers to accessing affordable and appropriate housing.However, the effects of this environmental press on their psychological well-being are rarely addressed.This project examined racial disparities between minority and white older adults' housing and environment conditions and the differential
