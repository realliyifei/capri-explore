IMMEDIATE DRUG RELEASE DOSAGE FORM: A REVIEW
2250-117743F970C13CEBFF695A70C974B59D7E08Immediate releasepolymerssuperdisintegrant
Among all dosage forms tablet is the most popular dosage form existing today because of its convenience of self administration, compactness and easy manufacturing; sometimes immediate onset of action is required than conventional therapy in many cases.So that to overcome these drawbacks, immediate release dosage form has emerged as alternative oral dosage forms.Immediate drug release dosage forms disintegrate rapidly after administration with enhanced rate of dissolution.The basic approach used in development tablets is the use of superdisintegrants like Cross linked Polyvinylpyrrolidone or crospovidone (Polyplasdone), Sodium starch glycolate (Primogel, Explotab), carboxymethylcellulose (Croscarmellose) etc.These superdisintegrants provide instantaneous disintegration of tablet after administration in stomach.In this field immedi ate release liquid dosage forms and parenteral dosage form have also been introduced for treating patients.In liquid dosage form can be suspensions with typical dispersion agents like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, AOT (dioctylsulfosuccinate) etc.The development of immediate release therapy also provides an opportunity for a line extension in the marketplace, a wide range of drugs e.g., neuroleptics, cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, antihistamines and other drugs can be considered candidates for this dosage form.As a drug entity nears the end of its patent life, it is common for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop a given drug entity in a new and improved dosage form.A new dosage form allows a manufacturer to extend market exclusivity, while offering its patient population a more convenient dosage form or dosing regimen.

## INTRODUCTION:

In the present study and research novel drug delivery systems are developed for expanding markets/indications, extending product life cycles and generating opportunities.Oral administration is the most popular route for systemic effects due to its ease of ingestion, pain, avoidance, versatility and most importantly patient compliance.In these solid formulations do not require sterile conditions and are therefore, less expensive to manufacture.Patient compliance, high-precision dosing, and manufacturing efficiency make tablets the solid dosage form of choice.Excipients and equipments choices will be significantly affected should solid dosage form technologies change in response to the unprecedented shifts in the drug discovery such as genomics.The development of enhanced oral protein delivery technology by immediate release tablets which may release the drugs at an enhanced rate are very promising for the delivery of poorly soluble drugs high molecular weight protein and peptide .The oral route remains the perfect route for the administration of therapeutic agents because the low cost of therapy, manufacturing and ease of administration lead to high levels of patient compliance.Many patients require quick onset of action in particular therapeutic condition and consequently immediate release of medicament is required.It is estimated that50% of the population is affected by this problem, which results in a high incidence of ineffective therapy.


## Definition:

Immediate release tablets are those which disintegrate rapidly and get dissolved to release the medicaments.Immediate release may be provided for by way of an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier, which diluent or carrier does not prolong, to an appreciable extent, the rate of drug release and/or absorption.This term excludes formulations which are adapted to provide for "modified", "controlled", "sustained", "prolonged", "extended" or "delayed" release of drug.

Release term includes the provision (or presentation) of drug from the formulation to the gastrointestinal tract, to body tissues and/or into systemic circulation.For gastrointestinal tract release, the release is under pH conditions such as pH=1 to 3, especially at, or about, pH=1.In one aspect of the invention a formulation as described herein with a compound of formula (I), or an acid addition salt thereof, in crystalline form releases drug under a range of pH conditions.In another aspect of the invention a formulation as described herein with a compound of formula (I), or an acid addition salt thereof, releases drug under pH conditions such as pH=1 to 3, especially at, or about, pH=1.Thus, formulations of the invention may release at least 70% (preferably 80%) of active ingredient within 4 hours, such as within 3 hours, preferably 2 hours, more preferably within 1.5 hours, and especially within an hour (such as within 30 minutes), of administration, whether this be oral or parenteral.


## Pharmacokinetics:

It is the study of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion.After absorption, drug attains therapeutic level and therefore elicits pharmacological effect, so both rate and extend of absorption is important.In conventional dosage form there is delay in disintegration and therefore dissolution is fast.Drug distribution depends on many factors like tissue permeability, perfusion rate, binding of drug to tissue, disease state, drug interaction etc. Duration and intensity of action depends upon rate of drug removal from the body or site of action i.e. biotransformation.Decrease in liver volume, regional blood flow to liver reduces the biotransformation of drug through oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis.Excretion by renal clearance is slowed, thus half-life of renal excreted drugs increase.


## Pharmacodynamic:

 Drug reception interaction impaired in elderly as well as in young adult due to undue development of organ.

 Decreased ability of the body to respond reflexive stimuli, cardiac output, and orthostatic hypotension may see in taking antihypertensive like prazosin.

 Decreased sensitivity of the CVS to α-adrenergic agonist and antagonist.

 Immunity is less and taken into consideration while administered antibiotics.

 Altered response to drug therapy-elderly show diminished bronchodilator effect of theophylline shows increased sensitivity to barbiturates.Other Excipients:

Excipients balance the properties of the actives in immediate release dosage forms.This demands a thorough understanding of the chemistry of these excipients to prevent interaction with the actives.Determining the cost of these ingredients is another issue that needs to be addressed by formulators.The role of excipients is important in the formulation of fast-melting tablets.These inactive food-grade ingredients, when incorporated in the formulation, impart the desired organoleptic properties and product efficacy.Excipients are general and can be used for a broad range of actives, except some actives that require masking agents.


## Bulking Materials:

Bulking materials are significant in the formulation of fastmelting tablets.The material contributes functions of a diluent, filler and cost reducer.Bulking agents improve the textural characteristics that in turn enhance the disintegration in the mouth, besides; adding bulk also reduces the concentration of the active in the composition.The recommended bulking agents for this delivery system should be more sugar-based such as mannitol, polydextrose, lactitol, DCL (direct compressible lactose) and starch hydrolystate for higher aqueous solubility and good sensory perception.Mannitol in particular has high aqueous solubility and good sensory perception.Bulking agents are added in the range of 10 percent to about 90 percent by weight of the final composition .


## Emulsifying Agents:

Emulsifying agents are important excipients for formulating immediate release tablets they aid in rapid disintegration and drug release.In addition, incorporating emulsifying agents is useful in stabilizing the immiscible blends and enhancing bioavailability.A wide range of emulsifiers is recommended for fast-tablet formulation, including alkyl sulfates, propylene glycol esters, lecithin, sucrose esters and others.These agents can be incorporated in the range of 0.05 percent to about 15 percent by weight of the final composition.


## Lubricants:

Lubricants, though not essential excipients, can further assist in making these tablets more palatable after they disintegrate in the mouth.Lubricants remove grittiness and assist in the drug transport mechanism from the mouth down into the stomach.


## Flavours and Sweeteners:

Flavours and taste-masking agents make the products more palatable and pleasing for patients.The addition of these ingredients assists in overcoming bitterness and undesirable tastes of some active ingredients.Both natural and synthetic flavours can be used to improve the organoleptic characteristic of fast-melting tablets.Formulators can choose from a wide range of sweeteners including sugar, dextrose and fructose, as well as nonnutritive sweeteners such as aspartame, sodium saccharin, sugar alcohols and sucralose.The addition of sweeteners contributes a pleasant taste as well as bulk to the composition.


## Super Disintegrants:

A disintegrant is an excipient, which is added to a tablet or capsule blend to aid in the break up of the compacted mass when it is put into a fluid environment.


## Advantages:




## Direct Compression Method:

In this method, tablets are compressed directly from the mixture of the drug and excipients without any preliminary treatment.The mixture to be compressed must have adequate flow properties and cohere under pressure thus making pretreatment as wet granulation unnecessary.Few drugs can be directly compressed into tablets of acceptable quality.A type of disintegrant and its proportion are of prime importance.The other factors to be considered are particle size distribution, contact angle, pore size distribution, tablet hardness and water absorption capacity.All these factors determine the disintegration.The disintegrant addition technology is cost effective and easy to implement at industrial level.


## Wet Granulation Method:

Wet granulation is a process of using a liquid binder to lightly agglomerate the powder mixture.The amount of liquid has to be properly controlled, as over-wetting will cause the granules to be too hard and under-wetting will cause them to be too soft and friable.Aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than solvent-based systems but may not be suitable for drugs which are degraded by hydrolysis.


## Procedure

 The active ingredient and excipients are weighed and mixed.

 The wet granulate is prepared by adding the liquid binder-adhesive to the powder blend and mixing thoroughly.Examples of binders/adhesives include aqueous preparations of cornstarch, natural gums such as acacia, and cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, gelatin, and povidone.

 Screening the damp mass through a mesh to form pellets or granules.

 Drying the granulation.A conventional tray-dryer or fluid-bed dryer are most commonly used.

 After the granules are dried, they are passed through a screen of smaller size than the one used for the wet mass to create granules of uniform size.

Low shear wet granulation processes use very simple mixing equipment, and can take a considerable time to achieve a uniformly mixed state.High shear wet granulation processes use equipment that mixes the powder and liquid at a very fast rate, and thus speeds up the manufacturing process.Fluid bed granulation is a multiple-step wet granulation process performed in the same vessel to pre-heat, granulate, and dry the powders.It is used because it allows close control of the granulation process.


## Mass-Extrusion (Mass-Extrusion):

This technology involves softening the active blend using the solvent mixture of water-soluble polyethylene glycol and methanol and subsequent expulsion of softened mass through the extruder or syringe to get a cylinder of the product into even segments using heated blade to form tablets.The dried cylinder can also be used to coat granules for bitter drugs and thereby achieve taste masking.


## By solid dispersions:

When formulating such solid amorphous dispersions into immediate release solid dosage forms for oral administration to a use environment such as the GI tract of an animal such as a human, it is often desirable to maximize the amount of dispersion present in the dosage form.This minimizes the size of the solid dosage form required to achieve the desired dose.Depending on the drug dose, it is often desired that the solid amorphous dispersion comprise at least 30 wt %, preferably at least wt %, and more preferably at least 50 wt % or more of the solid dosage form.Such high drug loadings of dispersion in a solid dosage form minimize the dosage form's size, making it easier for the patient to swallow it and tending to improve patient compliance.

The immediate release dosage forms containing a solid dispersion that enhances the solubility of a "low-solubility drug," meaning that the drug may be either "substantially water-insoluble," which means that the drug has a minimum aqueous solubility at physiologically relevant pH (e.g., pH 1-8) of less than 0.01 mg/mL, "sparingly water-soluble," that is, has an aqueous solubility up to about 1 to 2 mg/mL, or even low to moderate aqueoussolubility, having an aqueous-solubility from about 1 mg/mL to as high as about 20 to 40 mg/mL.

The drug dispersions used in fabricating the high loading immediate release dosage forms of the present invention comprise solid dispersions of a drug and at least one concentration-enhancing polymer.The concentrationenhancing polymer is present in the dispersions used in the present invention in a sufficient amount so as to improve the concentration of the drug in a use environment relative to a control composition.At a minimum, the dispersions used in the present invention provide concentration enhancement relative to a control consisting of crystalline drug alone.Thus, the concentration-enhancing polymer is present in a sufficient amount so that when the dispersion is administered to a use environment, the dispersion provides improved drug concentration relative to a control consisting of an equivalent amount of crystalline drug, but with no concentration-enhancing polymer present.


## Evaluation of powder blend:

The prepared blend is evaluated by following tests.Angle of repose was determined by using fixed funnel method.The fixed funnel method employ a funnel that was secured with its tip at a given height (2cm), above the graph paper that was placed on a flat horizontal surface.Granules or tablet blend were carefully poured through the funnel until the apex of the conical pile just touches the tip of the funnel.Thus, with r being the radius of the base of the conical pile.Angle of repose was calculated using the following equation.


## Tapped Density:

Tapped density is ratio of mass of tablet blend to tapped volume of tablet blend.Accurately weighed amount of tablet blend poured in graduated cylinder and height is measured.Then cylinder was allowed to 100tap under its own weight onto a hard surface.The tapping was continued until no further change in height was noted.

Here; m = weight of powder or granules (gm.) v = Tapped Volume (cm.


## Hausner's Ratio:

Hausner's ratio indicates the flow properties of powder and measured by the ratio of tapped density to bulk density.Hausner's ratio was determined by the given formula


## Carr's Index (Compressibility Index):

Compressibility is the ability of powder to decrease in volume under pressure using bulk density and tapped density the percentage compressibility of powder were determined, which is given as carr's compressibility index.

It is indirectly related to the relative flow rate.Carr's compressibility index was determined by the given formula


## EVALUATION OF TABLETS

These tests are as following:- The general appearance of tablet is its visual identity and all over elegance, shape, color, surface textures.These all parameters are essential for consumer acceptance.


## Thickness:

The thickness of the tablets was determined by using vernier calipers.Randomly 10 tablets selected were used for determination of thickness that expressed in Mean± SD and unit is mm.


## Hardness:

The hardness of tablet is an indication of its strength against resistance of tablets to capping, abrasion or breakage under conditions of storage, transportation and handling before usage.Measuring the force required to break the tablet across tests it.Hardness of 10 tablets (randomly) from whole tablet batch was determined by Monsanto hardness tester.Hardness measured in kg/cm 2 .


## Weight variation:

The weight variation test is carried out in order to ensure uniformity in the weight of tablets in a batch.The total weight of 20 tablets randomly from whole batch was determined and the average was calculated.

The individual weights of the tablets were also determined accurately and the weight variation was calculated.


## Friability test:

Friability is the loss of weight of tablet in the container due to removal of fine particles from the surface during transportation or handling.Roche friabilator was employed for finding the friability of the tablets.For tablets with an average weight of 0.65 g or less take a sample of whole tablets corresponding to about 6.5 g and for tablets with an average weight of more than 0.65 g take a sample of 10 whole tablets.Roche friabilator is rotated at 25rpm for 4 minutes for 100rounds.The tablets were dedusted and weighed again.The percentage of weight loss was calculated using the formula


## Disintegration test:

The USP device to rest disintegration was six glass tubes that are "3 long, open at the top, and held against 10" screen at the bottom end of the basket rack assembly.One tablet is placed in each tube and the basket rack is poisoned in 1 liter beaker of distilled water at 37± 2 0 C, such that the tablets remain below the surface of the liquid on their upward movement and descend not closer than 2.5cm from the bottom of the beaker.


## Uniformity of dispersion:

Two tablets were kept in 100ml water and gently stirred for 2 minutes.The dispersion was passed through 22 meshes.The tablets were considered to pass the test if no residue remained on the screen.


## Wetting Time:

The wetting time of the tablets was measured using a simple procedure.Five circular tissue papers of 10cm diameter were placed in a petridish containing 0.2% w/v solution of amaranth (10ml).One tablet was carefully placed on the surface of the tissue paper.The time required for develop blue color due to amaranth water soluble dye on the upper surface of the tablets was noted as the wetting time.


## Water Absorption Ratio:

A small piece of tissue paper folded twice was placed in a small petridish containing 6ml of water.A tablet was put on the paper.The wetted tablet was then weighed.Water absorption ratio, R was determined by using following formula


## R x 100

Here, R = Water absorption ratio W b = Weight of tablet before water absorption W a = Weight of tablet after water absorption 10.Drug content:

10 tablets were powdered and 100mg drug equivalent powder dissolved in suitable media buffer or 0.1N HCl.Volume of the solution made up to 100ml by that media.Solution was filtered and diluted 100times and analyzed spectrophotometrically and further calculation carried out to determine drug content in one tablet.


## In vitro drug release studies:

The immediate release tablets are subjected to in vitro drug release studies in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer or 0.1N HCl for 30 minutes to access the ability of the formulation for providing immediate drug delivery.

Drug release studies were carried out in dissolution test apparatus using specified volume 900ml of dissolution media maintained at 37±0.2 0 C. The tablets are kept in the cylindrical basket or directly placed in medium with paddle then rotated at 100 rpm.5ml of the sample from the dissolution are withdrawn at each time interval (5, 10, 15 & 30 minutes) and 5ml of fresh medium was replaced each time.The samples were filtered and from the filtrate 1ml was taken and diluted to 10ml.These samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically and further calculation was carried out to get drug release.The drug released data were plotted and tested with zero order (Cumulative % drug released Vs time), First order (Log % Remained Vs time).The in vitro dissolution kinetic parameters, dissolution rate constants, correlation coefficient and dissolution efficiency were calculated.


## Stability study:

Stability is defined as the ability of a particular drug or dosage form in a specific container to remain within its physical, chemical, therapeutic, and toxicological specifications.Drug decomposition or degradation occurs during storage, because of chemical alteration of the active ingredients or due to product instability, lowering the concentration of the drug in the dosage form.

Stability study of the dosage form must include a section for product characterization and another section to study the product stability during storage.Formulations are evaluated for their appearance, possible weight gain in drug content thickness, flatness, folding endurance, tensile strength, moisture content and moisture uptake, and invitro release study by keeping dosage form in different temperature and humidity condition after a specified time.The stability study indicates that the formulation is quite stable at different conditions of storage.


## CONCLUSION:

This is new enhanced oral product arising within this market segment and applicable to a wide range of therapeutic agents.Approximately one-third of the patients need quick therapeutic action of drug, resulting in poor compliance with conventional drug therapy which leads to reduced overall therapy effectiveness.A new dosage format, the immediate release pharmaceutical form has been developed which offers the combined advantages of ease of dosing and convenience of dosing.These tablets are designed to release the medicaments with an enhanced rate.Due to the constraints of the current technologies as highlighted above, there is an unmet need for improved manufacturing processes for immediate release pharmaceutical form that are mechanically strong, allowing ease of handling and packaging and with production costs similar to that of conventional tablets.To fulfill these medical needs, formulators have devoted considerable effort to developing a novel type of tablet dosage form for oral administration, one that disintegrates and dissolves rapidly with enhanced dissolution.An extension of market exclusivity, which can be provided by immediate release dosage form, leads to increased revenue, while also targeting underserved and under-treated patient populations.

## Problems with Existing Oral Dosage Form:
 Concomitant illnesses are often present in elderly,which is also taken into consideration, while multipledrug therapy prescribed.Research workers have clinically evaluated drugcombination for various classes' cardiovascularagents, diuretics, anti-hypertensive etc. for immediaterelease dosage forms. The combination choicedepends on disease state of the patient. Patient may suffer from tremors therefore they havedifficulty to take powder and liquids. In dysphasiaphysical obstacles and adherence to an oesophagusmay cause gastrointestinal ulceration. Swallowing of solid dosage forms like tablet andcapsules and produce difficulty for young adult ofincomplete development of muscular and nervoussystem and elderly patients suffer from dysphasia. Liquid medicaments (suspension and emulsion) arepacked in multidose container; therefore achievementof uniformity in the content of each dose may bedifficult. Buccal and sublingual formation may cause irritationto oral mucosa, so patients refused to use suchmedications. Cost of products is main factor as parenteralformulations are most costly and discomfort.

## Desired Criteria for Immediate Release Drug Delivery System:
 Exhibit low sensitivity to environmental condition ashumidity and temperature. Be manufactured using conventional processing andpackaging equipment at low cost. Rapid dissolution and absorption of drug, which mayproduce rapid onset of action.Immediate release dosage form should- In the case of solid dosage it should dissolve ordisintegrate in the stomach within a short period. In the case of liquid dosage form it should becompatible with taste masking. Be portable without fragility concern. Have a pleasing mouth feel. It should not leave minimal or no residue in themouth after oral administration.

## Merits of Immediate Release Drug Delivery System:
 Improved compliance/added convenience Improved stability, bioavailability Suitable for controlled/sustained release actives Allows high drug loading. Ability to provide advantages of liquid medication inthe form of solid preparation. Adaptable and amenable to existing processing andpackaging machinery Cost-effective Improvedsolubility of thepharmaceuticalcomposition; Decreased disintegration and dissolution times forimmediate release oral dosage forms;



In this technology, water-soluble ingredients are used so that tablet disintegrate and dissolve rapidly.The powder blend is moistened with a hydro alcoholic solvent and is molded in to tablet using compression pressure lower than used in conventional tablets compression.The solvent is then removed by air-drying.Molded tablets have a porous structure that enhances dissolution.Two problems commonly encountered are mechanical strength and poor taste masking characteristics.Using binding agents such as sucrose, acacia or poly vinyl pyrrolidone can increase the mechanical strength of the tablet.To overcome poor taste masking characteristic Van Scoik incorporated drug containing discrete particles, which were formed by spray congealing a molten mixture of hydrogenated cottonseed oil, sodium bicarbonate, lecithin, polyethylene glycol and active ingredient into a lactose based tablet triturate form.
