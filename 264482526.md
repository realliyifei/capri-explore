## INTRODUCTION

The condition of the COVID-19 pandemic that has occurred since the beginning of 2020 throughout the world community has undoubtedly had a significant impact on all aspects of human life.One of the fundamental areas affected is the field of higher education.According to Bilecen (2020), the impact can be seen in changes in lecturer teaching patterns in digital classrooms, students no longer occupying classrooms, laboratories, libraries, or campus facilities, and the elimination of face-to-face learning activities on campus.Health and economic factors are also essential factors that undoubtedly contribute to higher education's teaching and learning conditions (Bilecen, 2020).The economic impact is undoubtedly very pronounced, especially for parents of students, because the data shows that these conditions affect the world economy, and the number of job dropouts is rampant.

The impact of COVID-19 pandemic conditions on higher education can be seen from two categories: physical and psychological.Physical conditions are oriented toward physical buildings, systems, and facilities on campus.Meanwhile, the psychological conditions in question lead to students.Research conducted by Son et al. (2020) showed that 138 (71%) showed increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Several stressors were identified that contributed to increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among college students.These include fears and concerns about their health and that of their loved ones (91%) reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty concentrating (89%), disrupted sleep patterns (86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distance (86%) and increased attention to academic performance (82%).

In facing the risks that occur during the COVID-19 pandemic, both physical and psychological (Wolkoff, 2020).Students, as human learners, need to try to adapt.Adaptability is believed to be a primary modality possessed by every learner.Based on research on students' ability to deal with change, the results show that adaptability is positively correlated with student engagement.In addition, the study also explained that good adaptability is positively correlated with mood conditions that students tend to experience positively.However, it negatively correlates with negative mood (Zhang et al., 2021).

The ability to be able to adjust to change is an important part that students need to strive for.During the pandemic, every student feels the challenges and difficulties faced in the learning process (Wolkoff, 2020).Based on a survey of the effectiveness of online learning at the beginning of the pandemic conducted by Sulaiman (2020) on 174 psychology students from one of the universities in Indonesia.The survey results on the effectiveness of online lectures show that 91% of students prefer the learning process in online learning rather than face-to-face.In addition, some students complain about the number of assignments, physical fatigue, difficulty concentrating, or internet network interruptions during the learning process.To increase students' resilience in facing these situations, it is necessary to formulate learning targets to be achieved both in the short and long term.This target will undoubtedly help students in achieving learning success.Then, the survey also obtained data showed that 30% of students feel physical disturbances, such as zoom fatigue, headache, and eyes feeling tired quickly.On the other hand, in the psychological aspect, this survey also showed that 46% of the total participants experienced problems in the psychological realm, such as stress, delaying the completion of assignments, and feeling anxious more easily.

Based on theoretical analysis, many factors determine research success.According to Duckworth & Gross (2015), cognitive and non-cognitive factors contribute to learning achievement.The cognitive factors in question are each student's intelligence capacity (IQ) and talent.Meanwhile, there are non-cognitive factors that also play an essential role in contributing to learning achievement.The non-cognitive factor is called grit.This found aligns with research conducted by Christopoulou et al. (2018), which also explained that gritted was a non-cognitive factor that played a significant role in student success in various fields.Duckworth's (2016) findings on gritted enrich the studied of factors that contribute to one's success.According to him, a person's true success influenced by talent and requires gritted.Individuals full of grit showed behaviors that could maintained their enthusiasm and motivation in the longed ran.Meanwhile, grit combines passion and fought power to achieve long-term goals.Duckworth (2020) also explained four domains of grit, namely (1).An interest is an attitude of liking to do something (2).The practice leads to a focus on improving skills (3).The intention is interpreted as a strong belief that everything done will benefit oneself and others, and (4).Hope is the belief that with consistent effort, everyone can overcome difficulties.

Grit can also be developed based on external factors, including (a).Parenting style, according to Duckworth, the role of parenting is an essential part of developing grit in children (b).Provide space for individuals to continue practicing.Space to practice is needed by individuals, especially in strengthening endurance which is also an essential factor of grit.and C).Develop a culture of grit (Duckworth, 2016).Culture is influential because the positive habits that are built will undoubtedly form an individual's identity, so this modality will be seen in all activities.Based on this explanation and referring to the results of systematic research on grit, it shows that aspects of passion and perseverance are positively correlated with academic achievement; the problem formulation in this study is how is the description of Grit implementation among psychology students at Private Universities?


## METHOD


## Study design

This research uses descriptive quantitative.This research was conducted in 2022 at psychology students in a Private University, Jakarta.Data collection was carried out in the period March -June 2022.


## Participant

The sampling technique used is convenience sampling.The sample criteria in this research are active psychology students consisting of semester one to semester ten, have an age range of 18-25 years, and are domiciled in Indonesia.Based on these criteria, the number of respondents involved was 336 students consisting of 46 males and 249 females.


## Instruments

A 12-item Grit scale developed by Angela Duckworth was used to measure students' grit.This questionnaire was structured based on two aspects of Grit: persistence of effort and consistency of interest.This measuring instrument uses a likert scale with answer options consisting of (1) Not like me at all, (2) Not much like me, (3) Somewhat like me, (4) Mostly like me and (5) Very much like me.I also provide examples of some of the items from the grit measurement tool used in this study: I have overcome setbacks to conquer important challenges, New ideas and projects sometimes distract me from the previous ones, My interests change from year to year, Setbacks do not discourage me, I am a hard worker, I am an organized person, I am an organized person (Duckworth, Petterson, Matthews & Kelly, 2007).

Based on the results of the tryout test, it was found that this test instrument was classified as reliable with a Cronbach alpha score: of 0.71.In addition, the validity test results using the item-rest correlation technique showed that all items were declared valid.The data collection process in this.Based on a recent study conducted on the millennial generation in Indonesia, especially in Surabaya from April to July 2019 through CFA analysis, the short grit scale proved to be valid (Priyohadi, Suhariadi & Fajrianti, 2019).A study by Xu K, Meijs, Gijselaers, et al. (2020) shows that measuring grit instruments based on the perseverance and passion domains has fulfilled the prerequisites of good psychometric properties.


## Procedure

The data collection process in this research uses Google Forms by changing the A 12item grit scale in the online version.After that, the researcher also prepared an informed consent to meet the ethical rules and the approval of prospective participants to be involved in this research.Regarding data analysis, this study uses descriptive statistical analysis techniques through the JASP version 16 application.This data processing includes calculating the respondents' demographic data and classifying the Grit application based on the standardization described by Angela Duckworth.


## Data Analysis

This study analyzed data using descriptive statistics through JASP software version 16.0.Descriptive statistical analysis was used to provide a classification of the quality of the implementation of Grit in students based on the norms of measuring instruments that Angela Duckworth has compiled.Based on Table 1, it is known that the male respondents were 46 people, with a percentage of 13.7%.Meanwhile, 290 others are female, with a percentage of 86.3%.Based on Table 2 regarding the distribution of semesters, it is known that most semester distributions are found in semester one student with 159 people or with a percentage of 47%.After that, it was followed by semester 2 with 50 students and then by semester three with 30 students.5th-semester students with 28 students with a percentage of 8%.They are followed by semesters four and 7 with a quantity of 5% or 18 people.Then, the other 16 respondents were students spread over semesters 8, 9, and 10.Based on Table 3 regarding the description of the application of Grit to students.From the research that has been done, the results show that 72% or as many as 243 participants are classified as individuals with quite gritty.According to Duckworth (2016), individuals classified as gritty are described as individuals who consistently maintain interest and passion for helping achieve long-term goals in the study.In addition, individuals with optimal Grit are described as individuals with strong resilience in the face of difficulties/obstacles in their studies.Based on this explanation, quite gritty can be interpreted as an individual who can sufficiently maintain interest and passion so that these modalities can contribute internally to the success of individuals in their studies.


## RESULT


## Participant's characteristics


## Data analysis

Referring to a recent studied conducted on Gritted on students in Indonesia, the findings supported this researched.Wadidah and Herdian (2021), in their studied entitled Grit on Students in Indonesia, showed that the leveled of Grit of students in Indonesia was in the moderate category (Quite Gritty).Meanwhile, this research also found results showing that the more optimal the application of Grit, the higher the learner's cumulative achievement index (GPA).The results of this study align with Feldman (2017), which shows that individuals classified as gritty have good academic performance, which impacts learning achievement (GPA).In addition, in his book, Feldman (2017) also explains that Grit is very strong in the effort domain.Elaboration of effort and talent is believed to be a skill.Then, skill and effort ultimately contribute to achievement.


## DISCUSSION

This study showed that implementing gritted-on students in private universities was considered optimal because it was in the category of quite gritty to gritty.The factors that contribute to the formation of gritted were (a).A high level of education can also set long-term learned goals that require good cognitive abilities.(b).Participants had a growth mindset modality, and (c).They tried to apply self-efficacy.The three factors contributing to grit formation are supported by previous studies described in the research The Role of Grit in Indonesian Students by Muhibbin and Laksono (2021).

The results of this study are supported by previous research, which confirms that the ability to apply grit in students is in the moderate category (Wahidah & Herdian, 2021).Previous research has shown that grit has been shown to improve academic achievement, career, and wellbeing and positively impact psychological aspects (Datu, 2021).On the other side, based on previous studied carried out by Tang, Wang, Guo & Aro (2019) The findings suggested that grit is associated with increased engagement and academic achievement, and practitioners who want to be improved gritted in adolescents could encouraged goal commitment more than a growth mindset.

Several recommendations can be given to parties with roles and responsibilities toward students.Students need to continue to develop the Grit aspect in the entire study process by exploring interests and formulating short-and long-term learning goals.Of course, these goals must be measurable and realistic.Maintain hope and train yourself to develop self-capacity (Duckworth & Gross, 2015).

In addition, previous studies show that students need to develop a growth mindset because it strongly correlates with the formation of Grit (Park, Tsukayama, Yu & Duckworth (2020).Individuals with a growth mindset believe that their abilities in them are not starting, even though they will be able to see difficulties and challenges as opportunities to continue to grow (Christantiana & Sembiring, 2017).The study also shows that a growth mindset contributes 40% to grit formation.Meanwhile, a fixed mindset reduces grit quality (Christantiana & Sembiring, 2017).

The academic supervisor's role also significantly contributes to the student's study journey.To improve the grit quality, the support factor from the supervisor can be optimized through the guidance room, which is held periodically with an agenda prepared in advance.For parents, it is in line with Duckworth's explanation in his book that external factors also contribute, namely the role of parents in parenting patterns and responses to the process while undergoing studies.Parents are expected to respond sincerely and positively.Appreciation can be given as an expression of pride for the efforts made.If there are unsatisfactory achievements, parents can also continue to motivate children.

Study according to the study program he is taking.The University can also carry out efforts to improve the quality of Grit by carrying out a comprehensive follow-up by conducting an initial assessment to determine the category of implementation.After that, the University, through the study program, can design an initiative program to improve the quality of Grit, of course not in a short time but continuously, until finally a reassessment can be carried out after the treatment is given to ensure and objectively measure the changes experienced by students at the end of the semester before completing the term.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTIn this section, as the researcher, I express my gratitude for the support that has been given so that this research can be carried out well.For the participation of students willing to be involved in this research.I would also like to thank the University for the financial support that certainly contributed to the completion of this research.Of course, colleagues who gave their willingness to help and advice for the completion of this manuscript.The limitation of this study is that the sampling technique needs to be more representative because it still uses non-probability types.Hence, researchers suggest further research to consider doing probability sampling so that the results are more representative in describing the population.The scope of the sample, which only focuses on the Psychology Department at one private university and there are difficulties in obtaining students' willingness as samples because this research was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic.In addition, this research still measures the quality of Grit implementation in general, meaning that it needs to explicitly look at the quality of 2 domains: passion and perseverance.Researchers could suggest this for future research so that the findings became richer to explore the optimal quality of Gritted application and was immediately supported by good application in these two domains.CONCLUSIONThe results of this study indicate that many respondents, namely 243 students or about 72%, are Quite Gritty.Meanwhile, 82 other respondents, with a percentage of around 25%, are in the Gritty category.Then, the other 11 respondents needed to be Gritty.This research data shows that the students have an excellent Grit modality.CONFLICT OF INTERESTIn this section, as the researcher, I declare that there is no conflict of interest in this research.If it is proven that there is a conflict of interest as intended in the future.Then, I am ready to take responsibility for these findings.
