The hotel industry can use social media to communicate with consumers and clients and learn about their needs. Before, during, and following a customer's vacation, the hotel sector can engage with them on numerous social networking sites. Affordableness, the ability to quickly and broadly disperse brand recognition, the power to draw attention, and the ability to produce substantial volumes of traffic are just a few of the many advantages of social media, a medium despite is still relatively new. The application of the WWW providing a forum for expressing opinions, grievances, and suggestions about goods and businesses has received extensive coverage in the popular media. Furthermore, familiarity with the company and whether the supplier is a pure Internet or a clicks-and-mortar organization influence how negatively WOM information affects perceived reliability and buy inclinations. The new study, which is essential for the proposed theory of how consumers act on the internet, shows for the initial time the influence gender plays on that impact and interprets it from the perspective of focused bias.Additionally, it clarifies the basic mechanism by which internet reviews affect purchasing decisions.

## INTRODUCTION

A small number of businesses have started incorporating social media platforms into their holistic marketing strategy in recent years. A message that is focused on the client is produced by integrating marketing, PR, and sales promotion. The growth of platforms has given users access like never before. The hotel industry should think about utilizing social networking sites as a platform to increase brand awareness and encourage direct client input because they are so easily PSYCHOLOGY AND EDUCATION (2018)  accessible to everyone with an internet connection. Advertising awareness has a favorable effect on brand identification on social media. In the current cutthroat, online-driven economy, a business that understands the advantages of networking sites is fully aware of the significance of social media in producing new clients.

Although most marketers would concur that running a successful community on the Internet is now extremely relevant to many organizations' successful marketing efforts, studies on online communities have rarely been carried out in the hotel industry (Kandampully et al., 2018). As a result, the current study stresses the need of figuring out what draws customers to hotel-related online communities and research the connections between involvement in these communities and loyalty to particular brands. Social media is becoming one of the most important platforms used by hotel owners to sell their establishments and cultivate relationships with visitors. To share their travel and holiday experiences, travelers frequently use social media platforms which include social media platforms, microblogs, and content-sharing groups. With the emergence of social media, research interests have turned to customer engagement. The types of content, media, and posting times that motivate customer participation in social media platforms include information gratification (Schuckert et al., 2015). Figure 1 shows that social-media work from many-to-many (Kudeshia and Mittal, 2015).  Website quality won't be part of the study's scope due to how difficult it is to measure the influence of other dimensions on purchase intentions.


## LITERATURE OF REVIEW

Leung et al., (2017) said that this is hardly surprising considering that most hotels and other lodging facilities promote reviews. If there were more reviews accessible for those aspects, one may anticipate an increase in the perceived benefit for other decisions. As the majority of travelers are required to submit an email address when making an Internet reservation, it is rather simple to encourage hotel reviews. After a guest's stay, hotels and online travel firms frequently send them an email asking for a review. There is a need for various models to offer rewards for reviews of destinations, restaurants, activities, and scheduling. To make traveling preparation more effective, evaluations should be smoothly merged with other content, such as maps and movies, rather than remaining on specialist websites.  Varkaris and Neuhofer (2017) told that it seems that online reviews are a strategic tool that is crucial to the management of hospitality and tourism, particularly in terms of advertising, online sales, and reputation management. It is anticipated that after reading this study, academics would have a comprehensive understanding of the prior research on online reviews in the hotel and tourism industries as well as the shortcomings of the current body of knowledge. Additionally, the authors hope that by providing managers with a summary of the key conclusions of recent research on online reviews, they will encourage them to reconsider revising or upgrading their ecommerce strategy. The following are some directions for future research that we suggest based on the shortcomings of previous research and the current operational status. Choi et al., (2016) described that the well-known promotional guru contends that an advertising message is essential, especially when using the internet platforms for marketing purposes. Using social media to hunt up travel-related information is more prevalent. Social media are viewed from a business perspective as advantageous instruments and effective platforms for fostering customer engagement and increasing consumer-company connections. It is not surprising that the hospitality sector is interested in social media usage for hotel social media marketing.

Additionally, it was said that hoteliers now placed high importance on social media and that approximately two-thirds of all accommodations used social media in some capacity to draw guests.


## Hongcharu and Eiamkanchanalai (2009) discovered along with the features of online reviews,

there is a favorable association between reviewer expertise and an individual's intent to book. This is consistent with past studies on how source information affects respondents' impressions.

These qualities of public speaking in the hotel industry, including a strong reputation, in-depth hotel information, and an absence of credit rating, make up this competence... People who often and favorably affect others' opinions and behaviors are known as opinion leaders. Although the reasons behind opinion leadership remain a mystery, a sizable body of research supports its significance in numerous fields. In their 1996 empirical investigation of the connection between involvement and leadership in opinion in tourism, Jamrozy et al. proposed that opinion leaders can be identified.


## Phelan et al., (2013)

found that because it has altered how consumers research, create, and share data concerning vacation-related goods web as well as when they select hotels, social media is crucial to the hospitality and tourist industry. It is not yet known how social media is utilized or how it affects consumers' hotel booking decisions. This study employed the qualitative deep-dive interview method with somewhat structured questions to examine how social media influences customer behavior while booking hotels. The study highlights the subtleties of online discourse

The e-commerce sector is expanding like a fungus. The online market in India has experienced tremendous expansion in recent years, which has had an impact on how travel items are distributed as well as how tourists seek and buy such products. The recently founded online travel planning companies currently account for a considerable share of global travel sales(Kim et al., 2011). Thanks to internet travel industry middlemen, the consumer has access to a variety of housing options, tourist items, travel destinations, brand choices, price ranges, and-most importantly-convenience. Service quality is determined by the customer's comparing the projected levels of service with the actual provider's performance. It is easier to assess the standard of hotel services.It is therefore inappropriate to utilize the event of online booking until after customers have stayed in the hotel accommodations. Online hotel reservations require communication with the website. Website quality is evaluated as a multi-dimensional notion and is an antecedent of trust and buy intention(Gautam and Sharma, 2017). This integrated model will get more difficult if website quality is added because more factors would need to be investigated and assessed.


Zhao et al. (2015) described that customer loyalty models nowadays include new ideas because of the shifting role of customers and their capacity to serve as a company's greatest asset and emotionally invested brand ambassador. Companies are no longer satisfied with the just passive support of a devoted consumer; instead, they want actively involved collaborators of value who take on joint ownership of their company and serve as brand ambassadors. Both businesses and customers are embracing the newest forms of engagement and communication. During the prebuy, purchase, and post-purchase phases of a transaction, customers virtually connect with other customers and businesses; as a result, businesses must innovate not just in their communication strategies but also, and perhaps more crucially, in how they engage customers.


Casaló et al.,(2007)  described that additionally, it was discovered that expertise affects customers' desire to read online evaluations for social validation. People with a moderate amount of hotel booking expertise, regardless of gender, demonstrated the greatest level of incentive to participate in reviews on the Internet for social reassurance. Consumers with a high degree of competence may believe they do not require social validation because they are secure in their knowledge, but individuals with a low level of understanding may be unaware of the social advantages of online evaluations, which is one reason for these findings. Website owners can encourage users to gain from social benefits by fostering a sense of a virtual community, allowing users to express more emotions, and allowing users to compare their opinions.Bruhn et al., (2012) illustrated that global communication among billions of people hastransformed as a result of the growth of web technology. Social media began to become more the early 1990s. It is a form of online community created using web technology to encourage greater connections between businesses and their clients regardless of distance. Some of the high fashion companies that have already adopted social media as an advertisement growth strategy include LinkedIn, Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter.
