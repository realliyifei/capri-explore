Supplementary Figures Patterns of tobacco use in low-and middle-income countries by tobacco product and sociodemographic characteristics: a study of nationally representative surveys from 82 countries



## Contents

Notes: The absolute difference (average marginal effect) was obtained from logistic regression models adjusting for sex and age (exposure: household residency, education, household wealth), sex (exposure: age), or sex (exposure: age). Horizontal bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Regressions models were estimated using sampling weights and standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the PSU level. For Colombia, standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the household level and for Marshall Islands at the country level. Country names are abbreviated using their ISO-3 code.


## Figure S 12: Current and daily smoking prevalences among adults aged 18-49 years by household residency and country

Notes: The results of the weighted logistic regression models are displayed as average adjusted predictions (AAP), which can be interpreted as prevalence among adults aged 18-49 years. Regression models were adjusted for sex and age. Horizontal bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Confidence intervals were censored at 0.00 and 100.00. Robust standard errors were clustered at the PSU level. Panels are sorted in ascending order according to countries' GDP per capita in the survey year. Note: The absolute difference (average marginal effect) was obtained from logistic regression models adjusting for sex and age (exposure: household residency, education, household wealth), sex (exposure: age), or sex (exposure: age).

Country names are abbreviated using their ISO-3 code.


## Figure S 18: Tobacco product use prevalence among daily smokers/users

Notes: Adjusted use prevalences among daily smokers / smokeless tobacco users are displayed. Estimates were obtained from logistic regression models with country fixed effects and adjusting for sex and age (exposure: household residency, education, household wealth), sex (exposure: age), or sex (exposure: age). Regressions models were estimated using sampling weights and standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the PSU level. Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

Abbreviations: Q=quintile (the least wealthy household wealth quintile is denoted as Q1 and the wealthiest as Q5)


## Figure S 19: Current and daily smokeless tobacco use prevalences by household residency and country

Notes: The results of the weighted logistic regression models are displayed as average adjusted predictions (AAP), which can be interpreted as prevalence among adults in the sampled age range. Regression models were adjusted for sex and age. Horizontal bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Confidence intervals were censored at 0.00 and 100.00. Robust standard errors were clustered at the PSU level. Panels are sorted in ascending order according to countries' GDP per capita in the survey year.

Note: : Panels display the crude (i.e., not age-standardized) smoking and smokeless tobacco use prevalences among adults in the sampled age range. Mean pack-years were calculated among current smokers who reported to smoke cigarettes. Sampling weights were used in all estimations to account for the complex survey design. Horizontal bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Country names are abbreviated using their ISO-3 code(Table 1).Figure S 2: Pack-years among current cigarette smokers globally and by countryNote: : Mean pack-years among adults in the sampled age range.

Notes: Panels display the crude (i.e., not age-standardized) daily smoking and daily smokeless tobacco use prevalences and mean pack-years among adults in the sampled age range. Mean pack-years were calculated among daily smokers who reported to smoke cigarettes. Sampling weights were used in all estimations to account for the complex survey design. Papua New Guinea was an outlier with a daily smokeless tobacco use prevalence of 65%.

Tuvalu was not part of the shape file and could thus not be displayed. Grey: LMICs for which no data were available. Blue: High-income countries.

Figure S 65: Tobacco use frequencies among current users of the respective product across all study countries by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and tobacco product (fully adjusted model) Notes: Pack-years were estimated among current smokers who reported smoking cigarettes. Estimates were obtained from Ordinary Least Squares regression models with country fixed effects and adjusting for sex and age (exposure: household residency, education, household wealth), sex (exposure: age), or sex (exposure: age). Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Regressions models were estimated using sampling weights and standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the PSU level.
