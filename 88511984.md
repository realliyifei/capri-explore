A brief presentation of basics of the theory of Tchebycheff and Markov systems of functions and its applications to extremal problems for integrals of such functions is given. The results, as well as all the necessary definitions, are stated in most common terms. This work is motivated by specific applications in probability and statistics. A few related questions are also briefly discussed, including the one on the existence of a Tchebycheff system on a given topological space.

For a nonnegative integer n, let g 0 , . . . , g n be (real-valued) continuous functions on a compact topological space X. Let M denote the set of all (nonnegative) Borel measures on X. Take any point c = (c 0 , . . . , c n ) ∈ R n+1 such that M c := µ ∈ M : X g i dµ = c i for all i ∈ 0, n = ∅;

(1)

Consider also the condition that the (generalized) polynomial n 0 λ i g i is strictly positive on X, for some (λ 0 , . . . , λ n ) ∈ R n+1 .

Carathéodory Principle. (See e.g. [3,5].) If the topologcal compact space X is Hausdorff and (2) holds, then the maximum of X g n+1 dµ over all µ ∈ M c is attained at some measure µ max ∈ M c with card supp µ max n + 1.

Here, as usual, card stands for the cardinality and supp µ denotes the support set of the measure µ. Note that in [5] it is additionally assumed that g 0 = 1, which is used to provide for the weak compactness of M c . However, the same effect is achieved under the more general condition (2). Remark 1. The condition that X be compact can oftentimes be circumvented by using, for instance, an appropriate compactification, say X, of X if X is (say) only locally compact (as, for instance, R k is). At that, one may be able to find a function h, which is positive and continuous on X and such that the functions g0 h , . . . , gn h can be continuously extended from X to X; sometimes one of the g i 's can play the role of h; or, more generally, h can be constructed as (or based on) a polynomial n 0 λ i g i . Replacing then g 0 , . . . , g n by the continuous extensions of the functions g0 h , . . . , gn h to X and, correspondingly, replacing the measure µ by the measure ν (on X and hence on X) defined by the formula dν = h dµ, one will largely reduce the original optimization problem on X to one on the compact space X.

The essential fact is that the upper bound n + 1 on the cardinality of the support of an extremal measure µ given in the Carathéodory Principle can be approximately halved in the presence of the Tchebycheff or, especially, Markov property. Definition 1. The sequence (g 0 , . . . , g n ) of functions is a T -system if the restrictions of these n + 1 functions to any subset of X of cardinality n + 1 are linearly independent. If, for each k ∈ 0, n, the initial subsequence (g 0 , . . . , g k ) of the sequence (g 0 , . . . , g n ) is a T -system, then (g 0 , . . . , g n ) is said to be an M -system (where M refers to Markov).

By Haar's theorem, linearly independent functions g 0 , . . . , g n on X form a T -system on X if and only the problem of best uniform approximation of any given continuous function on X by a polynomial n 0 λ i g i has a unique solution; see e.g. [13].

Any T -system satisfies the condition (2); see e.g. [6, Theorem II.1.4].

For any n 1 and any topological space X of cardinality n + 1, if there exists a T -system (g 0 , . . . , g n ) of continuous functions on X, then X is necessarily Hausdorff. Indeed, take any distinct x 0 and x 1 in X. Let x 2 , . . . , x n be any points in X such that x 0 , . . . , x n are distinct. The restrictions of the functions g 0 , . . . , g n to the set {x 0 , . . . , x n } are linearly independent and hence g i (x 0 ) = g i (x 1 ) for some i ∈ 0, n. Take now any disjoint open sets O 0 and O 1 in R containing g i (x 0 ) and g i (x 1 ), respectively. Then the pre-images g −1 i (O 0 ) and g −1 i (O 1 ) of O 0 and O 1 under the mapping g i are disjoint open sets in X containing x 0 and x 1 , respectively. Thus, X is a Hausdorff topological space.

In connection with Remark 1, it should be noted that, clearly, if (g 0 , . . . , g k ) is a T -system or an M -system, then the same is true of the sequence ( g0 h , . . . , gn h ), for any positive continuous function h. Note also that, if (g 0 , . . . , g n ) is a Tsystem on a set X ′ containing X and such that card(X ′ \ X) n, then
(h 0 , . . . , h n ) := A(g 0 , . . . , g n ) is an M -system on X for some linear (necessarily nonsingular) transformation A of R n+1 ; cf. [6, Theorem II.4.1].
A T -system (g 0 , . . . , g n ) with n 1 on (the compact topological space) X exists only if X is one-dimensional (which will be the case in many applications). More precisely, if for some n 1 there exists a T -system of n + 1 functions on X, then X must be homeomorphic to a subset of a circle; for X ⊆ R k this was proved in [7], and for general X in [2] (with an additional restriction) and in [16]; a further extension of this result to complex T -systems was given in [14], where one can also find yet another proof of the real-valued version.

In fact, the general case of (real-valued) T -systems can be easily reduced to the special case with X ⊆ R k . Indeed, for any natural n consider the mapping x → r(x) := g(x)/ g(x) of X into the unit sphere S n in R n+1 , where g(x) := (g 0 (x), . . . , g n (x)) and · is the Euclidean norm. In view of the T -property of (g 0 , . . . , g n ) and the compactness of X, this mapping is correctly defined since g(x) is nonzero for any x ∈ X , one-to-one, and continuous, and hence a homeomorphism of the compact Hausdorff set X onto the image in S n of X under the mapping r. In the case n = 1, this also proves the mentioned result of [7,2,16]. Another elementary observation in this regard, presented in [1], is that a T -system (g 0 , . . . , g n ) with n 1 on X may exist only if X does not contain a "tripod", that is a set homeomorphic to the set
{(s, 0) ∈ R 2 : |s| < 1} ∪ {(0, t) ∈ R 2 : 0 < t < 1}.
We shall henceforth consider the case when X = [a, b] for some a and b such that −∞ < a < b < ∞. Let (g 0 , . . . , g n ) be a T -system on [a, b]. Let det g i (x j ) n 0 denote the determinant of the matrix g i (x j ) : i ∈ 0, n, j ∈ 0, n . This determinant is continuous in (x 0 , . . . , x n ) in the (convex) simplex (say Σ) defined by the inequalities a x 0 < · · · < x n b and does not vanish anywhere on Σ. So, det g i (x j ) n 0 is constant in sign on Σ. Definition 2. The sequence (g 0 , . . . , g n ) is said to be a T + -system on [a, b] if det g i (x j ) n 0 > 0 for all (x 0 , . . . , x n ) ∈ Σ. If (g 0 , . . . , g k ) is a T + -system on [a, b] for each k ∈ 0, n, then the sequence (g 0 , . . . , g n ) is said to be an M + -system on [a, b].

Clearly, if (g 0 , . . . , g n ) is a T -system on [a, b], then either (g 0 , . . . , g n ) or

imsart-generic ver. 2009/05/21 file: arxiv.tex date: February 17, 2022 (g 0 , . . . , g n−1 , −g n ) is a T + -system on [a, b]. Similarly, if (g 0 , . . . , g n ) is an Msystem on [a, b] then, for some sequence (s 0 , . . . , s n ) ∈ {−1, 1} n+1 of signs, (s 0 g 0 . . . , s n g n ) is an M + -system on [a, b].

In the case when the functions g 0 , . . . , g n are n times differentiable at a point x ∈ (a, b), consider also the Wronskians
W k 0 (x) := det g (j) i (x) k 0 ,
where k ∈ 0, n and g The proof of Proposition 1 can be obtained by induction on n using the recursive formulas for the determinants det g i (x j ) n 0 and W n 0 as displayed right above [4, (5.5) in Chapter VIII] and in [4, (5.6) in Chapter VIII], where we use g i in place of ψ i . Proposition 2. Suppose that (g 0 , . . . , g n+1 ) is an M + -system on [a, b] or, more generally, each of the sequences (g 0 , . . . , g n ) and (g 0 , . . . , g n+1 ) is a T + -system on [a, b]. Suppose also that condition (1) holds. Let m := ⌊ n+1 2 ⌋. Then one has the following.

(I) The maximum (respectively, the minimum) of b a g n+1 dµ over all µ ∈ M c is attained at a unique measure µ max (respectively, µ min ) in M c . Moreover, the measures µ max and µ min do not depend on the choice of g n+1 , as long as g n+1 is such that (g 0 , . . . , g n+1 ) is a T + -system on [a, b]. (II) There exist subsets X max and X min of [a, b] such that X max ⊇ supp µ max , X min ⊇ supp µ min , and (a) if n = 2m then card X max = card X min = m + 1, X max ∋ b, and X min ∋ a;

(b) if n = 2m − 1 then card X max = m + 1, card X min = m, and X max ⊇ {a, b}.

Whereas the maximizer µ max and the minimizer µ min are each unique in M c for each given c with M c = ∅, in particular applications such as the ones in [8], one may want to allow the vector c to vary, and then the measures µ max and µ min will vary with c, and thus the corresponding subsets X max and X min of [a, b] may vary. Then the number of real variables needed to describe each of the sets X max and X min will be about n+1 2 , that is, half the number of restrictions on the measure µ and also half the upper bound on card supp µ max in the Carathéodory Principle; here one should also take into account that, as described in part (II) of Proposition 2, the sets X max and X min may have to contain at least one of the endpoints a and b of the interval [a, b], with the corresponding reduction in the required number of variables. On the other hand, the Carathéodory Principle holds for more general systems of functions, defined on a set X of a much more general class.

To illustrate Proposition 2, one may consider the simplest two special cases when the conditions of the proposition hold and its conclusion is obvious: These examples also show that the T -property of systems of functions can be considered as generalized monotonicity/convexity; see e.g. [15] and bibliography there.
(i) n = 0, g 0 (x) ≡ 1,
Proof of Proposition 2. Consider two cases, depending on whether c is strictly or singularly positive; in equivalent geometric terms, this means, respectively, that c belongs to the interior or the boundary of the smallest closed convex cone containing the subset {(g 0 (x), . . . , g n (x)) : x ∈ [a, b]} of R n+1 [6, Theorem IV.6.1].

In the first case, when c is strictly positive, both statements of Proposition 2 follow by [6, Theorem IV. 1.1]; at that, one should let X max = supp µ max and X min = supp µ min . (The condition that c be strictly positive appears to be missing in the statement of the latter theorem; cf. [4, Theorem 1.1 of Chapter 1.1].)

In the other case, when c is singularly positive, use [6, Theorem III.4.1], which states that in this case the set M c consists of a single measure (say µ * ), and its support set X * := supp µ * is of an index n; that is, ℓ − + 2ℓ + ℓ + n, where ℓ − , ℓ, and ℓ + stand for the cardinalities of the intersections of X * with the sets {a}, (a, b), and {b}. It remains to show that this condition on the index of X * implies that there exist subsets X max and X min of [a, b] satisfying the conditions (IIa) and (IIb) of Proposition 2 and such that X max ∩ X min ⊇ X * .

If n = 2m then card(X * ∩ (a, b)) = ℓ ⌊ 2m−ℓ−−ℓ+ 2 ⌋ ⌊ 2m−ℓ− 2 ⌋ = m − ℓ − ; so, card(X * ∪ {b}) ℓ − + (m − ℓ − ) + 1 = m + 1. Adding now to the set X * ∪ {b} any m+ 1 − card(X * ∪{b}) points of the complement of X * ∪{b} to [a, b], one obtains a subset X max of [a, b] such that X max ⊇ X * , X max ∋ b, and card X max = m + 1. Similarly, there exists a subset X min of [a, b] such that X min ⊇ X * , X min ∋ a, and card X min = m + 1.

If n = 2m − 1 then card(X * ∩ (a, b)) = ℓ ⌊ 2m−1−ℓ−−ℓ+ 2 ⌋ m − 1 and hence card(X * ∪ {a, b}) 1 + (m − 1) + 1 = m + 1. So, there exists a subset X max of [a, b] such that X max ⊇ X * , X max ⊇ {a, b}, and card X max = m + 1. One also has card X * = ℓ − + ℓ + ℓ + ⌊ 2m−1+ℓ−+ℓ+ 2 ⌋ ⌊ 2m+1 2 ⌋ = m. So, there exists a subset X min of [a, b] such that X min ⊇ X * and card X min = m.

## .
Suppose that the functions g 0 , . . . , g n are (still continuous on [a, b] and) n times differentiable on (a, b). Then, for the sequence (g 0 , . . . , g n ) to be an M + -system on [a, b], it is necessary that W k 0 0 on (a, b) for all k ∈ 0, n, and it is sufficient that u 0 > 0 on [a, b] and W k 0 > 0 on (a, b) for all k ∈ 1, n. Thus, verifying the M + -property largely reduces to checking the positivity of several functions of only one variable.A special case of Proposition 1 (with n = 1 and g 0 = 1) is the following wellknown fact: if a function g 1 is continuous on [a, b] and has a positive derivative on (a, b), then g 1 is (strictly) increasing on [a, b]; vice versa, if g 1 is increasing on [a, b], then the derivative of g 1 (if exists) must be nonnegative on (a, b).As in this special case, the proof of Proposition 1 in general can be based on the mean-value theorem; cf. e.g. [4, Theorem 1.1 of Chapter XI], which states that the requirement for W k 0 to be strictly positive on the closed interval [a, b] for all k ∈ 0, n is equivalent to a condition somewhat stronger than being an M + -system on [a, b]; in connection with this, one may also want to look at [6, Theorem IV.5.2]. Note that, in the applications to the proofs of [8, Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3], the relevant Wronskians vanish at the left endpoint of the interval.


g 1 is increasing on [a, b], and c 0 0; then supp µ max ⊆ {b} and supp µ min ⊆ {a}; in fact, µ max = c 0 δ b and µ min = c 0 δ a ; here and in what follows, δ x denotes the Dirac probability measure at point x. (ii) n = 1, g 0 (x) ≡ 1, g 1 (x) ≡ x, g 2 is strictly convex on [a, b], c 0 0, and c 1 ∈ [c 0 a, c 0 b]; then supp µ max ⊆ {a, b} and card supp µ min 1; in fact, µ max = c0b−c1 b−a δ a + c1−c0a b−a δ b , and µ min = c 0 δ c1/c0 if c 0 > 0 and µ min = 0 if c 0 = 0.
