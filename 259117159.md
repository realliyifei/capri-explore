This paper sought a qualitative/quantitative bibliometric approach, using the literature review, to present the main strategies with a bias toward sustainability, used by private Higher Education Institutions, in an attempt to neutralize the effects of the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. To meet the reliability requirements of the source of the papers used, a search was made in the Web of Science and Scopus databases, where 47 papers were selected. As a result, there was a scattering of strategic actions in several works. However, no actions were identified that orientated to deliberate planning, as a way of confrontation with the new environment that was quickly established, caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, we found fragmented or emerging strategic actions, mostly concentrated on Teaching activities as a possible response, given the circumstances, to a situation that presented itself as an emergency. This study divides the actions identified in the strategic areas of the Institutions into Teaching, Research, Extension, Business Management, and Teacher Training.

## Introdution

Periods of crisis generate impacts on the performance of organizations, establishing new relationships between market participants in which they operate. (Salunkhe, Rajan & Kumar, 2021;Wade, 2009). The Covid-19 disease spread rapidly across the planet, forcing the closure of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) around the world, reaching all countries in a way never seen before (Akinbi, Forshaw, & Blinkhorn, 2021;Cordova et al., 2021;Tomé & Gromova, 2021). The crisis forced the governments of countries around the world to decree the suspension of school activities associated with measures to safeguard the financial health of HEIs, in an attempt to slow down the spread of Covid-19 (Pan, 2021;Barnová, Krásna, & Gabrhelova, 2020). As a result of this crisis, HEIs were forced to migrate to remote mode, forcing professors, students, and the administrative staff of HEIs to quickly adapt to the new reality (Bartolic et al., 2021;Biwer et al., 2021). This sudden migration revealed social inequalities, which became challenges to overcome in the attempt to offer distance education for all (Oyedotun, 2020).

HEIs with experience in remote activities found this migration easier. This does not exclude the need for interaction provided by face-to-face activities (Kocak-Tufan, 2020;Appoloni et al., 2021). Thanks to advances in communication technologies and the need for survival, HEIs have had accelerated access to remote learning platforms (McInnes, Aitchison, & Sloot, 2020). According to Rababah et al. (2021), the postponement of projects in HEIs was inevitable, in addition to the need to review their priorities. As a consequence, budgets had to undergo revisions, affecting all stakeholders (Behan, 2021). The term sustainability commonly refers to environmental issues, although the term can be extended to the long-term intra-organizational environment (Neubert & Bruno, 2016).

Based on the research carried out, this is the first study to assess the effects of Covid-19 from the perspective of Teaching, Research, Extension, Teacher Training and Business Management. This study differs from the others, as the researched articles deal with these areas of Teaching, Research, and Extension in education, in isolation. The present work elaborates its evaluations under the perspective of the Teaching, Research, and Extension areas together, associating them also under the perspective of Teacher Training and Business Management. This view becomes important, as it provides a broad understanding of the enterprise, thus facilitating decision-making. In addition, there is a need to review the literature on initiatives developed by private HEIs, whose sustainability is more vulnerable to the challenges posed by the pandemic. This review aims to provide relevant information to identify sustainable strategies developed by these institutions and to verify gaps in the literature. Thus, this review focused on previously published studies that addressed private HEIs that, during the Covid-19 pandemic, sought to develop sustainable strategies from the entrepreneurship point of view. The research questions that this review proposes are: Have private HEIs been able to develop sustainable strategies from the point of view of business management during the Covid-19 pandemic? What were the strategies that best responded to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic? This study uses a bibliometric and qualitative approach in the literature review process.


## Methodology

The study uses an approach bibliometric qualitative/quantitative through the literature review process to define a set more focused on the central theme. Gil (2008) states that bibliographic research is developed based on material already prepared, such as books and papers. Having an exploratory character, it proposes an analysis of the different positions on a problem. Cervo, Bervian & Da Silva (2007) argue that in bibliographic research, the source and information are presented in the form of documents, whether printed or electronic, and Marconi & Lakatos (2010) explained that the goal is to place the researcher in contact with everything that has already been produced on a given topic. Following these guidelines, the sources of information, the search algorithms and the steps for defining the set of documents to be analyzed qualitatively were defined.

The research material (scientific articles) was searched in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Only complete articles were included, excluding abstracts and other types of publications accepted. Articles that contained only published abstracts were excluded.


### Procedures used in the research

The delimitation of the scope and definition of the study parameters, led to the definition of the keywords used in the research of the databases, which were: "strategic", "university", "sustainable", "sustainable management" and "Covid-19". The use of keywords in English was used in order to cover the largest number of publications, the search feature used the Boolean operators AND and OR to form the search strings. Papers from the last 3 (three) years were selected due to the Covid-19 epidemic event being the generating factor of the events that guide the research. Using the combination University AND Strategic AND Sustainable AND Covid-19, 64 occurrences were found; using the combination University AND Strategic AND (Sustainable OR Covid-19) 1122 occurrences were found; using the combination University AND Strategic AND ("sustainable management" OR Covid-19), 86 occurrences were found; using the combinations University AND Strategic* AND Covid-19, 74 occurrences were found; using the combinations University AND Strategic AND "Sustainable Management" AND Covid-19, 36 occurrences were found. In order to expand the ability to search for studies on the subject, the combination (school* AND financ* AND universit* AND privat* AND pandem*) was used, where 26 papers were found, totaling 1408 occurrences. After selection using the filters: topic selection (management, business, Business Finance, education educational research, Education Scientific Discipline), selection by full papers and selection by languages (English, Portuguese and Spanish), limited to the periods from 2020 to 2022,154 papers remained. After the selection based on the reading of the abstracts, where only the articles that addressed private Higher Education Institutions were chosen, 68 articles remained and after reading the articles, 47 studies were selected, that met the research objectives. This bibliographic review took place between March 15 and 31, 2022. Fig. 1 shows the flowchart of the selection of articles performed.

Once the most relevant documents were defined, the classification and analysis of the strategies of private educational institutions were carried out.


## Results and discussions

The network maps were created using the VOSviewer software, through the bibliographic data obtained from the analysis of the articles selected for this review. The network that represents the co-authorship relationship between authors shows the level of cooperation. In the elaboration process, 159 authors were identified divided into 43 clusters, with 6 (six) main clusters (Table 1): Cluster 1, formed by 12 (twelve) authors who studied business management in universities, focused in the area of social responsibility during the pandemic; cluster 2, formed by 11 (eleven) authors who studied the teaching area, more precisely the impacts of covid-19 on returning to classes at universities; cluster 3, formed by 10 (ten) authors focused on extension activities with the involvement of the university community in order to develop ideas to increase safety and well-being in the campus; cluster 4, formed by 9 (nine) authors, who discussed the difficulties of maintaining internationalization activities in Latin America during the lockdown; cluster 5, formed by 7 (seven) authors who studied, within the context of Teaching, the importance of synchronous activities for students during the pandemic; and cluster 6, formed by 7 (seven) authors who studied the analysis of the practice of distance learning, where students value time with family and the availability of flexible hours more than academic experiences, resulting in proximity to cluster 3. Fig. 2 represents the main keywords used by the authors, where 4 (four) significant clusters were found. The term Covid-19 is at the heart of the issue, showing a direct relationship with almost all of the identified words, with some words keeping relationships with each other. The proximity between the words points to the research theme. The word Covid-19 (green cluster) and its ramifications (basic medical science, business schools, covid-19, school management) takes on a prominent role as it represents the environment that triggered the entire process of change throughout society; higher education (yellow cluster), and its connections (corporate social responsibility, digital skills, higher education, student-centred learning, sustainable development goals), standing out as the main object of the study. The red cluster is composed by the terms e-learning, education and economy with their connections (e-learning, economy, education, knowledge manager, management, student satisfaction index model, sustainability, teaching) sumarize the main action that involves the Business Management, which were used by the educational institutions as immediate resources for the continuity of activities, avoiding the flight of financial resources during the pandemic; and the blue cluster formed by the term distance learning and its derivations (education innovation, Microsoft teams, motivation for learning,  Source: Research Data teacher education), which represents the main strategic action used by HEI as an immediate response aiming at the continuity of their activities. Fig. 3 represents the incidence of terms in all the papers, with 316 terms found in the base of the texts with at least two occurrences. From this combination, 4 (four) clusters were generated, highlighting the cluster in red which covers themes related to the university and its internal issues such as controlling the movement of people and strategic approaches as a solution; the green cluster highlights teaching activities, emphasizing academic issues, business sustainability and its impacts on the student body; the blue cluster gathers the studies that evaluated the main strategic action used by the HEI, which was remote teaching; and finally the yellow cluster, where the papers discussed the impacts of Covid-19 on HEI from the point of view of the enterprise and its impacts on stakeholders. Table 2 shows the considerable experience in scientific production of the first authors of the selected papers. The productions found in the Web of Science and Scopus databases were counted, without excluding repeated documents. Authors with at least 3 (three) publications in the research area of this study were highlighted. Table 3 shows the countries in which there were the highest number of publications. Those who obtained at least 02 (two) publications on the subject were selected, showing a balance of publications between countries, but keeping the United States in the lead of scientific production in the area, although most of the studies are from Europe. Table 4 presents the scientific magazines that published more than 1 paper on the topic addressed by this literature review. Among the 27 magazines selected by this study, Sustainability stands out, mainly covering studies on Sustainable Management and Strategies and Social Responsibility.

Up to this point, the vast experience of the main selected authors has been demonstrated. The distribution of surveys selected by countries is balanced. In addition to presenting the scientific journals that concentrated the largest number of publications in the researched area. From this point on, it is important to show the strategic areas that were the focus of the main interests.

This study selected 47 papers based on strategic areas of private HEI, such as Teaching, Research, Extension, Business Management and Teacher Training. Table 5, built from the information contained in Table 6 (Annex 1), where contains the analysis of selected papers, presents the distribution of authors by strategic areas.

In the Teaching area, the articles addressed the relationship between teachers and students in the virtual environment, as well as the consequences of moving away from the academic environment, in addition to highlighting the lack of planning when migrating to remote activity (Gourlay, 2021;Serna-Tuya et al., 2020;Sobral et al., 2021;Lee & Jung, 2021;López, 2022;Bautista, Bleza, Buhain, & Balibrea, 2021;Lara-Pietro et al., 2021). It was also highlighted in the papers, the concern with changes from face-to-face teaching to remote activity, the use of teaching technologies and their adaptations, as well as the hybrid teaching system, the concern with the health of teachers and students due to the need for confinement (Aristovnik et al., 2020;Degollación Coz & y Rimac Ventura, 2022;Drozdikova-Zaripova et al., 2021;Mishall, Meguid, Khalil, Lee, & Lisa, 2022;Monteiro & Leite, 2021;Owolabi, 2020;Owolabi & Bekele, 2021;Perrin & Wang, 2021;Ribeiro & Corrêa, 2020;Yusof, Atan, Harun, Rosli, & Majid, 2021), in addition to the concern with maintaining the course's internationalization activities (Cordova et al., 2021). In summary, in the area of education, institutions focused their concern on the continuity of academic activities, partly as a mission, and partly as a fundamental action for financial survival.

In the Research area, the study presented indicates that in most Institutions the flow of resources destined for the research area was interrupted, keeping only the resources for research in activities directly related to the Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the concern with the aspects of ethics involved (Malherbe & Schutte, 2021). The fact that I did not find more articles on the maintenance or attempt to maintain research activities during the pandemic, reveals that during a crisis and because of the need to reduce costs, the following conditions were observed: a) given the difficulty of carrying out laboratory activities remotely, many types of research were interrupted; b) that, given the need to reduce costs to ensure the survival of Educational Institutions, research activities were relegated to the background.

In the Extension area, a study was found that emphasizes partnership actions with companies to prepare students through practical activities to insert them into the job market, and another highlighting the effort to seek community participation in the decision-making process. of the Higher Education Institution (Hodges & Martin, 2020;Day et al., 2021).

In the area of Business Management, the works found focused their actions on satisfying the interests of their Stakeholders, through the maintenance and reinforcement of values and strategic guidelines (Mission and Vision, Values and Objectives) as a value proposition (Behan, 2021;Falkenstein, Hommel, Snelson-Powel, & Annie, 2022;Ungheri, Lelis, Soares, Ferreira, & Da Silva, 2021;Badawood, 2021;-Tawaha, 2021), agility in responses, the importance of accounting data and the approximation between administration and teachers and other employees and other types of actions, as a way to streamline strategic actions and reduce costs, prioritizing activities, without prejudice to the quality of the service (Tomé and Gromova, 2021;Ihnatova et al., 2021;Ng, 2021;Makgahlela et al., 2021), for the importance of the strategy based on institutional Information and Communication Technology, using social media as a strategic communication tool (Al-Youbi et al., 2020;H ashim et al., 2022), in addition to the impacts of the pandemic on social responsibility activities and actions (Rababah et al., 2021).

In the area of Teacher Training, in general, training was limited to training for the exercise of remote activity, more specifically in an attempt to become familiar with the virtual environment Based on the analysis of Table 6, Graph 1 can be drawn up, showing that most research focused their interests on Teaching activities (51%) due to the urgency of Institutions to return to activities, even remotely. The Research activity accounted for 2% of the studies, which may indicate that the Educational Institutions prioritized the continuity of activities in the classroom, instead research activities. On the one hand, due to the need to guarantee a cash flow to provide financial sustainability and, on the other hand, as a way to reduce costs, paralyzing, even if momentarily, investments in research. Papers that highlighted Extension activities accounted for 4% of publications as a result of efforts to keep these activities running, even remotely. The papers that showed Business Management accounted for 36% of published research, which deserves attention, since the lockdown directly put the enterprise at risk, forcing HEI to reinvent themselves with the aim of remaining sustainable without losing sight of the post-pandemic period. Teacher Training activities accounted for 4% of scientific production, a percentage that reinforces the interest of Teaching Institutions in continuing with school activities, however, with little concern to train teachers, understanding that the situation was momentary, and that soon, the activities would return to the "normal" model of teaching.

After evaluating the works selected by this review, listed in Table 6 and it was demonstrated that the Institutions' priority was to maintain the continuity of classroom activities remotely (Teaching) leaving the activities of research in the background as an attempt to maintain the financial sustainability of the enterprise, and Extension, since most   Source: Research Data.

activities involve direct contact with the community. As an attempt to maintain the sustainability of the enterprise, the activities involving Business Management focused their actions on responding to possible concerns of the stakeholders. The Teacher Training activities emphasized the importance of preparing the teaching staff as an attempt to maintain the quality of teaching in the remote environment. Based on the strategic guidelines of renowned researchers, the strategies identified in this review can be analyzed.


### A comparative analysis based on the main authors on strategy

To guide managers of private Higher Education Institutions, we present a comparative analysis between the concepts of the main authors in business strategy and the behavior observed by most of the Higher Education Institutions surveyed. Porter (1986) states that the essence of strategy is to develop unique differentials that lead the organization to a sustainable competitive advantage over rivals, but what was observed in this review is that the actions identified portray the need for survival as a preponderant factor. In the future, this experience should support the development by HEI of competitive strategies. However in face of the pandemic phenomenon, actions responded to an emergency situation where, according to the studies evaluated here, the absence of planning and a deliberate strategy that already had the effects of a disruptive event prevailed. Johnson, Scholes, and Whittington (2005), and Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and Lampel (2000), understand the concept of deliberate strategy as an intentional movement to influence a given situation and emerging strategies as a learning process of the organization about the situation faced, and its ability to deal with her. In this study, actions that resembled a deliberate strategic formulation model were not identified in the selected works, approaching more to an emerging model, in which the organization seeks to learn from the reality that is presented and the impositions defined by the environment of business. Johnson et al. (2005), define strategy as a long-term activity, related to the scope of the organization to obtain an advantage over competitors, adjusting its strategy to environmental forces. However, it can be understood as the creation of opportunities through the development of competencies combined with the creation of values, satisfying the expectations of its stakeholders. The researched articles demonstrated the importance of the stakeholders in the construction of the strategies chosen by the private HEIs, and with the concern in the development of short-term actions. No evidence was found of attempts at strategic elaborations seeking a competitive advantage, but actions to adapt to the new environment that presents itself intending to survive an unexpected situation.

The formulation of fragments of strategies that met an emerging need was evidenced, thus approaching the definition of Mintzberg et al. (2000).

Private Higher Education Institutions faced a major challenge during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Unlike Federal and State Higher Education Institutions that, due to their characteristics, receive government resources to maintain their activities, private HEIs needed to develop creative and innovative strategies to remain economically viable, since the resources for their maintenance as an organization are derived from the of course tuition payment.

And based on the analysis of the selected papers, the results found point to the lack of deliberate strategies, and yes evidence was found that private HEIs, in an attempt to maintain the viability of the business, resorted to emergency actions as an attempt to survive. The content of the papers on the strategies defined here makes clear the option for the continuity of academic activities, through remote teaching, to the detriment of research activity, as a way to reduce the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on HEIs, ignoring the consequences of this choice in the quality of teaching.


## Conclusion

The present work reviewed the available bibliography, to contribute to the managers of private Higher Education Institutions identifying whether these Institutions were able to develop sustainable strategies as a way of mitigating the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis. Therefore, two research questions were elaborate: Have private HEIs been able to develop sustainable strategies from the point of view of business management during the Covid-19 pandemic? What were the strategies that best responded to the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic? As a result, we can see, in a comparison with renowned authors on the subject, that emerging strategies prevailed over deliberate strategies. The research also points towards a strategic action that prevailed, through the studies presented, which was the direction of actions aimed at remote teaching, as the best possible response to the challenges that arise.

As research limitations, this study does not address the impacts of transferring to remote teaching on students' health and its consequences for the continuity of post-pandemic teaching, moreover, it leaves some gaps that need to be filled with future research, such as: a) Was remote emergency teaching able to maintain the same level of quality as face-toface teaching? b) As part of a sustainable strategy, were the other jobs in the HEIs preserved? c) What is the impact of the return to face-to-face activities on the strategies of Higher Education Institutions?

Other studies must address this issue, as it is a strategic mistake to believe that there will be a return to normality in terms before the pandemic.
