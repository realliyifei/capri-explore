# Overview

In this note we shall give a novel proof that Hardy's Operator H, defined on L 2 ([0, 1]) by the formula,
Hf (x) = 1 x x 0 f (t)dt, x ∈ (0, 1],
is bounded. This new proof relies only on algebra together with the observation that the monomial functions are eigenvectors for H. Specifically, for each k ≥ 0,
Hx k = 1 k + 1 x k . (1.1)
Always intrigued by results in analysis whose proofs rely mainly on algebra, the new proof of Hardy's Inequality prompts the authors to propose the following definition. 
V f (x) = x 0 f (t)dt, x ∈ (0, 1].
Both M x and V are of order In this note we shall prove the following result. Theorem 1.5. If T is a monomial operator, then T is vanishing preserving.

Why might such a theorem be true? If T is a monomial operator, and f is a polynomial that vanishes at 0 to some high order M, then T f also vanishes to order at least M. So if one thinks of vanishing on [0, s] as an extreme case of vanishing to high order, one might believe that monomial operators preserve this property.

Our proof of Theorem 1.5 relies on a new type of Müntz-Szász Theorem, wherein the monomial sequence is allowed to drift. This may be more interesting than the theorem itself!


# Hardy's Inequality

For a continuous function f on [0, 1] consider the continuous function Hf on (0, 1] defined by the formula
Hf (x) = 1 x x 0 f (t)dt, x ∈ (0, 1]. (2.1)
Noting that as x → 0, 1 x → ∞ and

x 0 f (t)dt → 0, the following question arises:

How does Hf behave near 0?

Invoking the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals yields that for each x ∈ [0, 1], there exists c ∈ [0, x] such that Hf (x) = f (c). Thus,
|Hf (x)| ≤ max t∈[0,x] |f (t)|,
x ∈ (0, 1], (2.2) so that in particular, Hf is bounded near 0. More delicately, if we apply the MVT to the function f (x) − f (0), we obtain the estimate
|Hf (x) − f (0)| ≤ max t∈[0,x] |f (t) − f (0)|, x ∈ (0, 1],(2.3)
which implies that Hf (x) → f (0) as x → 0. Therefore, if we agree to extend the definition of Hf at the point x = 0 by setting Hf (0) = f (0), then our observations imply the following proposition. |f (x)|.

(2.5)

Hardy [5] was the first to study the local behavior of H at 0 for functions equipped with norms other than the supremum norm. His result when specialized to L 2 ([0, 1]), the Hilbert space of square integrable Lesbesgue measurable functions on [0, 1], is as follows. 
|Hf (x)| 2 dx ≤ 4 1 0 |f (x)| 2 . (2.7) A linear operator T on a normed vector space V is called bounded 1 if there is some constant C so that T v ≤ C v ∀v ∈ V. (2.8)
The infimum of all C for which (2.8) holds is called the norm of T , and written T . Using this terminology, (2.7) says H ≤ 2.

Our proof of Proposition 2.6 in Section 4 relies on a new "sum of squares identity" involving the operator H, proved using (1.1).


# Hilbert Space distance formula

Let h 1 , . . . , h n be n vectors in a hilbert space H. We may associate to these vectors their Gram matrix, i.e., the n × n matrix G[h 1 , . . . , h n ] defined by
G[h 1 , . . . , h n ] ij = h j , h i H .
An often used application is the following elegant formula for the distance to the span of h 1 , . . . , h n . 
dist(h, span{h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N }) = det G[h, h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N ] det G[h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N ] . (3.2) Proof. Write h = k + m, where k is in the span of {h 1 , . . . , h N } and m is perpendicular to the span. Then m = dist(h, span{h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N }). We can write det G[h, h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N ] = det G[k, h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N ] + det G[m, h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N ].
Since k is in the span of
{h 1 , . . . , h N }, we have det G[k, h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N ] = 0. Moreover, G[m, h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N ] is a matrix whose first row is ( m , m , 0, . . . , 0). Therefore det G[m, h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N ] = m 2 det G[h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N .
Combining these observations, we get (3.2). QED


# A Hilbert space proof of Hardy's Inequality

The key step in our proof is the following lemma.

Lemma 4.1. An Identity for H
f 2 = (1 − H)f 2 + 1 0 f (x)dx 2 ∀f ∈ L 2 ([0, 1]).
Proof. It suffices to show for f a polynomial, since the polynomials are dense in
L 2 [0, 1]. If f (x) = n j=0 a j x j then f 2 = 1 0 n i,j=0 a i a j x i+j dx = n i,j=0 a i a j 1 i + j + 1 .
Likewise, as
(1 − H)f (x) = n j=0 j j + 1 a j x j , (1 − H)f 2 = n i,j=0
a i a j ij (i + 1)(j + 1)(i + j + 1) .

Hence
f 2 − (1 − H)f 2 = n i,j=0 a i a j 1 i + j + 1 − ij (i + 1)(j + 1)(i + j + 1) = n i,j=0 a i a j 1 (i + 1)(j + 1) = | 1 0 f (x)dx| 2 .

## QED

Proof. We now complete the proof of Proposition 2.6. We want to prove that H ≤ 2. By Lemma 4.1, (1 − H) ≤ 1. Therefore,
H = 1 − (1 − H) ≤ 1 + 1 − H ≤ 1 + 1 = 2.

# An asymptotic Müntz-Szász Theorem

Let S be a subset of the non-negative integers. When is the linear span of the monomials {x n : n ∈ S} dense? The Müntz-Szász Theorem, proved by Müntz [6] and Szász [7], answers this question in both L 2 [0, 1] and C[0, 1], the continuous functions on [0, 1]. The answer is basically the same in both cases, but the constant function 1 plays a special role in C[0, 1], since it cannot be approximated by any polynomial that vanishes at 0 (which all the other monomials do). For each n let ρ n denote the fraction of the non-negative integers less than or equal to n + N n that do not lie in S n , i.e., ρ n = n n + N n + 1 .


## Finally, with this setup, let
M ∞ = {f ∈ L 2 ([0, 1]) | lim n→∞ dist(f, M n ) = 0}. (5.3)
We wish to characterize M ∞ (Theorem 5.12 below). We shall follow Müntz's original proof of Theorem 5.1 [6]. His argument involved an ingenious calculation using Theorem 3.1 and the following venerable formula of Cauchy [3]. 
M =      1 x 1 −y 1 1 x 1 −y 2 . . . 1 x 1 −y N 1 x 2 −y 1 1 x 2 −y 2 . . . 1 x 2 −y N . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 x N −y 1 1 x N −y 2 . . . 1 x N −y N      ,
where for all i and j, x i = y j , then
det M = 1≤j<i≤N (x i − x j )(y j − y i ) 1≤i,j≤N (x i − y j )
.

We need two more auxiliary results. Proof. Note that the constant function 1 has the unique representation in L 2 ([0, 1]),
1 = f + g (5.6)
where f ⊥ M and g ∈ M. The fact that M is M x invariant, implies that pg ∈ M whenever p is a polynomial 2 , it follows that f ⊥ pg whenever p is a polynomial. But then fḡ ⊥ p for all polynomials which implies that fḡ = 0 (5.7)

For a Lesbesgue measurable set E ⊆ [0, 1] we let χ E denote the characteristic function of E, i.e., the function defined by
χ E (x) = 0 if x ∈ E 1 if x ∈ E .
We observe that (5.6) and (5.7) imply that there exists a partition of [0, 1] into two measurable sets F and G such that f = χ F and g = χ G . We define a parameter s ∈ [0, 1] by setting
s = sup{x | g(t) = 0 for a.e. t ∈ [0, x]}. (5.8)
Notice that with this definition, we have that Since g ∈ M, we have V g ∈ M. Also, recall that f ∈ M ⊥ . Therefore, using (5.9) we see that F ⊆ [0, s]. In light of (5.6), this implies [s, 1] ⊆ G, which in turn, implies via (5.8) that Proof. Observe first that if Now fix N + 1 distinct real numbers α 0 , α 1 , . . . , α N ∈ (− 1 2 , ∞). In Theorem 5.4 if for i, j = 1, 2, . . . , N we let x i = α i + 1 2 and y j = −(α j + 1 2 ) we obtain that
p(x) = n+Nn k=n a k x k ∈ M n , then M x p(x) = xp(x) = n+Nn+1 k=n+1 a k−1 x k ∈ M n+1 . Hence, M x M ∞ ⊆ M ∞ . Likewise, V M ∞ ⊆ M ∞ .det G(x α 1 , . . . , x α N ) = 1≤j<i≤N (α i − α j ) 2 1≤i,j≤N (α i + α j + 1) . Likewise, det G(x α 0 , x α 1 , . . . , x α N ) = 0≤j<i≤N (α i − α j ) 2 0≤i,j≤N (α i + α j + 1) . Therefore, det G(x α 0 , x α 1 , . . . , x α N ) det G(x α 1 , . . . , x α N ) = 1 2α 0 + 1 N i=1 (α i − α 0 ) 2 N i=1 (α i + α 0 + 1) 2
Hence, using Theorem 3.1 we get
dist(1, M n ) 2 = det G(x 0 , x n , . . . , x n+Nn ) det G(x n , . . . , x n+Nn ) = Nn i=0 (n + i) 2 Nn i=0 (n + i + 1) 2 = ( n n + N n + 1 ) 2 = ρ 2 n .
Equation ( 
then M unif ∞ = {f ∈ C[0, 1]|f = 0 on [0, ρ 2 ]}.
Proof. As the supremum norm is larger than the L 2 norm, we have
M unif ∞ ⊆ M ∞ ∩ C[0, 1] = {f ∈ C[0, 1]|f = 0 on [0, ρ 2 ]}.
For the reverse inclusion, notice that it follows from Cauchy-Schwarz that the Volterra operator is a bounded linear map from L 2 [0, 1] into C[0, 1]. (Indeed, if g ∈ L 2 [0, 1], we get that V g satisfies a Hölder continuity condition of order 1 2 .) Let f be a C 1 function that vanishes on [0, ρ 2 ]. Then f = V g, where g = f ′ . By Theorem 5.12, there are polynomials p n ∈ M n that converge in L 2 to g. Then V p n converges in C[0, 1] to f , so f is in M unif ∞ . As M unif ∞ is closed, and the C 1 functions that vanish on [0, ρ 2 ] are dense in the continuous ones, we get As T is bounded, T p n → T f in L 2 ([0, 1]).

Also, as T is a monomial operator of order m, for each n, T p n has the form T p n (x) = x m n+Nn k=n d k x k .

For any s > 0, multiplication by x m is a bounded invertible map from L 2 ([s, 1]) to itself. Therefore n+Nn k=n d k x k converges, as n → ∞, to some function g(x), which by Theorem 5.12 is in L 2 ([s, 1]). So T f = x m g(x), and lies in in L 2 ([s, 1]). QED

## Definition 1. 2 .
2We say that T is a monomial operator if T is a bounded operator on L 2 ([0, 1]) and there exist a number m and a sequence of scalars c 0 , c 1 , c 2 . . . such that for all k, T x k = c k x k+m . (1.3) We shall call the number m in (1.3) the order of T . It can be any complex number with non-negative real part, though in all our examples it will be a natural number. In addition to H, a monomial operator of order 0, other examples of monomial operators are the multiplication operator M x that sends a function f (x) to the function xf (x), and the Volterra operator V = M x H, the operator given by


Theorem 5.1. (Müntz-Szász Theorem) (i) The linear span of {x n : n ∈ S} is dense in L 2 ) The linear span of {x n : n ∈ S} is dense in C[0, 1] if and only if 0 ∈ S and (5.2) holds. What happens if the approximants come from a set of linear combinations of monomials that is losing as well as gaining members? Fix an increasing sequence {N n } of natural numbers and for each n define S n = {n, n + 1, . . . , n + N n } and M n = span {x n , x n+1 , . . . , x n+Nn }.


Theorem 5.4. (The Cauchy Determinant Formula) If M is the N × N Cauchy matrix defined by the formula


Brodskii-Donoghue Theorem) Let M be a closed subspace of L 2 [0, 1] that is invariant under both M x and V . Then M = L 2 [s, 1] for some s between 0 and 1.


V g(x) = 0 for a.e. ∈ [0, s] and V g(x) > 0 for a.e. ∈ [s, 1]. (5.9)

## f
= χ [0,s] and g = χ [s,1] . (5.10) As pf ∈ M ⊥ and pg ∈ M whenever p is a polynomial, it follows immediately from (5.10) and the fact that the polynomials are dense in both L 2 ([0, s]) and L 2 ([s, 1]), that L 2 ([0, s]) ⊆ M ⊥ and L 2 ([s, 1]) ⊆ M. Hence, we have that both L 2 ([s, 1]) ⊇ M and L 2 ([s, 1]) ⊆ M, so that L 2 ([s, 1]) = M, as was to be proved. QED We call Proposition 5.5 the Baby Brodskii-Donoghue Theorem because Brodskii and Donoghue independently proved the far deeper fact that the only closed invariant subspaces of V are L 2 [s, 1] [2, 4]. The operator M x has other invariant subspaces. Indeed the ideas in the preceding proof can be adapted to show that the invariant subspaces of M x are the spaces {f ∈ L 2 [0, 1] : f (x) = 0 a.e. on F }, where F is any measurable subset of [0, 1]. Lemma 5.11. If M ∞ is as in (5.3), then there exists s ∈ [0, 1] such that M ∞ = L 2 ([s, 1]).


Now the result follows from Lemma 5.5. QED Theorem 5.12. (Asymptotic Müntz-Szász Theorem) Let S n = {n, n + 1, . . . , n + N n }, let M n = span {x n , x n+1 , . . . , x n+Nn }, and let ρ n = n n+Nn+1 . If lim n→∞ ρ n = ρ, then M ∞ = L 2 ([ρ 2 , 1]). Proof. By Lemma 5.11 there exists s ∈ [0, 1] such that M ∞ = L 2 ([s, 1]). Noting that dist(1, L 2 ([s, 1])) = √ s, we see that the theorem will follow if we can show that dist(1, M ∞ ) = ρ, or equivalently that lim n→∞ dist(1, M n ) = ρ. (5.13)


{f ∈ C[0, 1]|f = 0 on [0, ρ 2 ]} ⊆ M unif ∞ . QED Question 6.4. Can one prove Theorem 6.3 directly using Bernstein approximation? 7 Proof of Theorem 1.5 Proof. Assume that T is a monomial operator of order m, let s ∈ (0, 1), and fix f ∈ L 2 ([s, 1]). We wish to prove that T f ∈ L 2 ([s, 1]). Choose an increasing sequence of natural numbers {N n } such that lim n→∞ n n + N n = √ s. By Theorem 5.12, there exists a sequence of polynomials {p n } where for each n, p n has the form p n (x) = n+Nn k=n c k x k and such that p n → f in L 2 ([0, 1]).


Definition 1.4. We shall say that a bounded operator T :L 2 [0, 1] → L 2 [0, 1] is vanishing preserving if T L 2 [s, 1] ⊆ L 2 [s,1] for every s in [0, 1).1. 
For 0 ≤ s ≤ 1 we shall use L 2 [s, 1] to denote the closed subspace of L 2 [0, 1] of functions 
that are 0 on [0, s]. 



5.13) now follows. QED 6 The Bernstein Conundrum: Asymptotic Müntz-Szász Theorem for C[0, 1] Theorem 6.3. (Asymptotic Müntz-Szász Theorem, Continuous Case) Iflim 

n→∞ 

ρ n = ρ, 


It is a straightforward exercise to show that a linear operator is bounded if and only if it is continuous.
Note that it is also true that pf ∈ M ⊥ whenever p is a polynomial, since M x is self-adjoint.
This means f C[0,1] = sup 0≤x≤1 |f (x)|.
The C[0, 1] Müntz-Szász Theorem can be deduced from the L 2 version. What about the asymptotic version? Let M n be as in Section 5, and let M unif ∞ bewhere in this section all distances are with respect to the supremum norm 3 . One way to prove the Weierstraß approximation theorem is to use the Bernstein polynomials. For each n, these are the n + 1 polynomials defined byBernstein proved in 1912[1]that for every continuous function f ∈ C[0, 1], the polynomialsconverge uniformly on [0, 1] to f . As the lowest order term in b k,n is x k , if f vanished on [0, ρ n ] and one used the Bernstein formula (6.2) to approximate it, the corresponding polynomial p n+Nn+1 would lie in the span of {x n+1 , . . . , x n+Nn+1 } which is in xM n ⊆ M n+1 . So one immediately gets that M unif ∞ contains all the continuous functions that vanish on [0, ρ].This construction seems natural, and could lead one to suspect that M unif ∞ should be the functions that vanish on [0, ρ]. However, Theorem 6.3 shows this is incorrect.
