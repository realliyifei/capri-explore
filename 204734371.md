A SURVEY OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF FOUR-MANIFOLD THEORY IN THE TOPOLOGICAL CATEGORY

The goal of this survey is to state some foundational theorems on 4-manifolds, especially in the topological category, give precise references, and provide indications of the strategies employed in the proofs. Where appropriate we give statements for manifolds of all dimensions. streit,

## Introduction

Here and throughout the paper "manifold" refers to what is often called a "topological manifold"; see Section 2 for a precise definition. Here are some of the statements discussed in this article.

(1) Existence and uniqueness of collar neighbourhoods (Theorem 2.5).

(2) The Isotopy Extension theorem (Theorem 2.10).

(3) Existence of CW structures (Theorem 4.5).

(4) Multiplicativity of the Euler characteristic under finite covers (Corollary 4.8).

(5) The Annulus theorem 5.1 and the Stable Homeomorphism Theorem 5.3. (6) Connected sum of two oriented connected 4-manifolds is well-defined (Theorem 5.11). (7) The intersection form of the connected sum of two 4-manifolds is the sum of the intersection forms of the summands (Proposition 5.15). (8) Existence and uniqueness of tubular neighbourhoods of submanifolds (Theorems 6.8 and 6.9). (9) Noncompact connected 4-manifolds admit a smooth structure (Theorem 8.1). (10) When the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant of a 4-manifold vanishes, both connected sum with copies of S 2 ×S 2 and taking the product with R yield smoothable manifolds (Theorem 8.6). (18) Poincaré duality for compact manifolds with twisted coefficients (Theorem A.15 and Theorem A.16). Many of these results are essential tools for the geometric topologist. Our hope is that with the statements from this note the "working topologist" will be equipped to handle most situations. For many of the topics discussed in this paper the corresponding statements for 4-manifolds with a smooth atlas are basic results in differential topology. However for general 4-manifolds, it can be difficult to find precise references. We aim to rectify this situation to some extent. Throughout the paper we make absolutely no claims of originality.


## Conventions.

(1) Given a subset A of a topological space X we denote the interior by Int A.

(2) For n ∈ N 0 we write D n = {x ∈ R n | x ≤ 1} for the closed unit ball in R n . We refer to Int D n = {x ∈ R n | x < 1} as the open n-ball. (4) On several occasions we use cup and cap products and we cite several results from [Dol95,Bre97,Hat02,Fri19]. Different books on algebraic topology often have different sign conventions for cup and cap products, but in all statements that we give, the sign conventions are irrelevant, so it is not a problem to mix results from different sources.


## Manifolds

In the literature the notion of a "manifold" gets defined differently, depending on the preferences of the authors. Thus we state in the following what we mean by a manifold.

Definition 2.1. Let X be a topological space.

(1) We say that X is second countable if there exists a countable basis for the topology.

(2) An n-dimensional chart for X at a point x ∈ X is a homeomorphism Φ : . , x n ) ∈ R n | x n ≥ 0} and Φ(x) lies on E n−1 = {(x 1 , . . . , x n ) ∈ R n | x n = 0}. In the former case we say that Φ is a chart of type (i) in the latter case we say that Φ is a chart of type (ii).
U → V where U is
(3) We say that X is an n-dimensional manifold if X is second countable and Hausdorff, and if for every x ∈ X there exists an n-dimensional chart Φ : U → V at x. (4) We say that a point x on a manifold is a boundary point if x admits a chart of type (ii). (A point cannot admit charts of both types [Hat02,Theorem 2B.3].) We denote the set of all boundary points of X by ∂X. (5) An atlas for a manifold X consists of a family of charts such that the domains cover all of X. An atlas is smooth if all transition maps are smooth. A smooth manifold is a manifold together with a smooth atlas. Usually one suppresses the choice of a smooth atlas from the notation.

To avoid misunderstandings we want to stress once again that what we call a "manifold" is often referred to as a "topological manifold". Using the cross product one can show that the product of two oriented manifolds admits a natural orientation. Furthermore, the boundary of an oriented manifold also comes with a natural orientation. The proof of the latter statement is slightly delicate; we refer to [GH81,Chapter 28] or to [Fri19,Chapter 45.9] for details.

2.1. Collar neighbourhoods. We discuss the existence of a collar neighbourhood of the boundary. First we recall the definition of a neighbourhood. Definition 2.3 (Neighbourhood). Let X be a space. A neighbourhood of a subset A ⊆ X is a set U ⊆ X for which there is an open set V satisfying A ⊆ V ⊆ U .

Next we give our definition of a collar neighbourhood.

Definition 2.4 (Collar neighbourhood). Let M be a manifold and let B be a compact submanifold of ∂M . A collar neighbourhood is a map Φ : B × [0, r] → M for some r > 0 with the following three properties:

(1) Φ is a homeomorphism onto its image, (2) for all P ∈ B we have Φ(P, 0) = P ,
(3) we have Φ −1 (B × [0, r]) ∩ ∂M = B.
Often, by a slight abuse of language, we identify B × [0, r] with its image Φ(B × [0, r]) and we refer to B × [0, r] also as a collar neighbourhood.

It is a consequence of the invariance of domain theorem that a collar neighbourhood of ∂M is in fact a neighbourhood of ∂M . Now we can state the collar neighbourhood theorem in the formulation of [Arm70, Theorem 1]. The existence of collars is originally due to Brown [Bro62].

Theorem 2.5 (Collar neighbourhood theorem). Let M be an n-manifold. Let C be a compact (n − 1)-dimensional submanifold of ∂M . (In most cases we take C = ∅.) Given any collar neighbourhood C × [0, 2], the restriction to C × [0, 1] can be extended to a collar neighbourhood ∂M × [0, 1].

To formulate a uniqueness result for collar neighbourhoods it helps to introduce the following definition.

Definition 2.6. Let f, g : X → Y be two maps between topological spaces and let Z be a subset of Y . We say f and g are ambiently isotopic rel. Z if there exists an isotopy H = {H t } t∈[0,1] : Y × [0, 1] → Y such that H 0 = Id, H t | Z = Id Z for all t and such that H 1 • f = g. The following corollary is a straightforward consequence of the Collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5. The corollary often makes it possible to reduce arguments about manifolds with boundary to the case of closed manifolds.  Now we stretch the last chart U k all the way back to x = x 0 . Define U = (H 1 ) −1 (U k ) and note that U contains both x and y. The homeomorphism φ = ψ k • H 1 : U → R n defines the required chart on M .

To obtain a locally flat arc connecting x and y, connect the points x and y by a straight line in the chart (U, φ).

A related result [DV09,Proposition 4.5.1] shows that one can approximate a map of a compact polyhedra into a manifold by a (non-locally flat) embedding.


## Smooth 4-manifolds and their intersection forms

In this chapter we consider some of the most famous 4-manifolds. Recall that not all symmetric unimodular pairings over Z can be realised as the intersection forms of closed, smooth 4-manifolds. We discuss some of these limitations below.

We start out with the definition of the intersection form.

Definition 3.1.

(1) Given a finitely generated abelian group H we write FH := H/torsion subgroup.

(2) Given an oriented compact 4-manifold M we refer to the map Let E 8 denote the even 8 × 8 Cartan matrix of the eponymous exceptional Lie algebra; that is, 
E 8 =                      .
Note that this is a symmetric integral matrix with determinant one.

Example 3.2. Here are some important closed, smooth 4-manifolds.

(1) The 4-sphere S 4 . This is simply connected and has H 2 (S 4 ; Z) = {0}.

(2) The complex projective plane CP 2 , which comes with a canonical orientation. The same underlying manifold with the opposite orientation is CP 2 . They are simplyconnected manifolds with H 2 (CP 2 ; Z) ∼ = Z. The intersection form of CP 2 is (1) and the intersection form of CP 2 is (−1). (3) The real projective space RP 4 , which is non-orientable and not simply-connected.

(4) The products S 2 × S 2 and S 1 × S 3 . The manifold S 2 × S 2 is simply-connected and H 2 (S 2 × S 2 ; Z) ∼ = Z ⊕ Z. The intersection form of S 2 × S 2 is represented by the standard hyperbolic form H := 0 1 1 0 .

(5) The K3 surface or Kummer surface K3 := [z 1 : z 2 : z 3 : z 4 ] ∈ CP 3 z 4 1 + z 4 2 + z 4 3 + z 4 4 = 0 This is a simply connected, smooth, spin, closed 4-manifold with H 2 (K3; Z) ∼ = Z 22 . As is shown in [GS99, Theorem 1.3.8] or alternatively [MS17,p. 176], the intersection form of K3 is isometric to E 8 ⊕ E 8 ⊕ H ⊕ H ⊕ H.

In Theorem 11.2 we will see that any unimodular symmetric form occurs as the intersection form of a closed oriented 4-manifold. In the following we survey results on intersection forms of closed oriented smooth 4-manifolds. As we will see, the results in the smooth setting differ dramatically from the results in the topological setting. Proof. Write Sq k for the kth Steenrod square operation. The kth Wu class v k ∈ H k (M ; Z/2) satisfies Sq k (a) = v k ∪ a, for every class a ∈ H 4−k (M ; Z/2). Hence if a ∈ H 2 (M ; Z/2) then v 2 ∪ a = Sq 2 (a) = a ∪ a. But the nth Stiefel-Whitney class of M is given by w n = i Sq i (v n−i ) (see [MS74,Theorem 11.14]). Since M is oriented and spin, we have 0 = w 1 = Sq 0 (v 1 ) = v 1 , and 0 = w 2 = Sq 0 (v 2 ) + Sq 1 (v 1 ) = v 2 . So for any a ∈ H 2 (M ; Z/2), we have a ∪ a = 0 ∪ a = 0 ∈ Z/2. But this implies that for any x ∈ F H 2 (M ; Z) we have that Q M (x, x) = PD −1 (x) ∪ PD −1 (x), [M ] ≡ 0 (mod 2). In other words Q M is an even form. It is then an algebraic fact, see e.g. [MH73,Theorem 5.1], that for any symmetric nonsingular bilinear even form Q the signature is divisible by 8.

Rochlin's Theorem [Roh52] gives an extra restriction on the signatures of intersection forms of spin 4-manifolds that admit a smooth structure.

Theorem 3.4 (Rochlin). Let M be a closed, oriented, spin, smooth 4-manifold. Then the signature sign(M ) is divisible by 16.

Remark 3.5. Let M be a closed oriented 4-manifold with an even intersection form and such that H 1 (M ; Z) has no 2-torsion. This implies H 2 (M ; Z/2) ∼ = Hom(H 2 (M ; Z), Z/2) and that the mod 2 reduction of Q M is isomorphic to the pairing (a, b) = a ∪ b, [M ] on H 2 (M ; Z/2). As Q M is even, this implies that (a, a) = 0 ∈ Z/2 for any a ∈ H 2 (M ; Z/2). But we saw above that a ∪ a = v 2 ∪ a, so we must have that v 2 = 0 as this pairing is nondegenerate. We also saw above that v 2 = w 2 when M is oriented, so in fact w 2 = 0 and M admits a spin structure.

It is not true that simply having an even intersection form implies M is spin. Indeed, it is possible to construct a closed oriented 4-manifold M that has Q M = 0 (which is in particular an even form), but has non-vanishing w 2 [GS99, Exercise 5.7.7(a)]. In a similar spirit, by [Hab82,FS84] there exists a closed oriented 4-dimensional smooth manifold M with an even intersection form Q M that satisfies sign(M ) = 8. Hence this must also fail to be spin, now by Rochlin's theorem.

Corollary 3.6. There exists a closed orientable 4-manifold that does not admit a smooth structure.

Proof. By Theorem 11.2 there exists a simply connected closed orientable 4-manifold M with Q M ∼ = E 8 . By Rochlin's Theorem 3.4 this manifold does not admit a smooth structure.

In a remarkable twist, shortly after Freedman proved Theorem 11.2, Donaldson [Don83, Theorem A] [Don87, Theorem 1], proved the following result regarding intersection forms of smooth 4-manifolds. It follows from [MH73,Theorem II.5.3] that every nonsingular indefinite odd symmetric form is isometric to k · (1) ⊕ · (−1). These are realised by k · CP 2 # · CP 2 . Therefore we only need to discuss the realisability of nonsingular indefinite even symmetric forms. Again by [MH73,Theorem II.5.3], every nonsingular even indefinite symmetric form is isometric to n · E 8 ⊕ m · H for some (m, n) ∈ N 0 × Z \ {(0, 0)}. The following theorem, proved by Furuta [Fur01], gives some restrictions on the possible values of m and n.

Theorem 3.8 (Furuta's 10/8 Theorem). If M is a closed oriented connected smooth 4manifold with indefinite even intersection form, then b 2 (M ) ≥ 10 8 · | sign(M )| + 2. In particular Q M ∼ = n · E 8 ⊕ m · H for some n ∈ 2Z and m ∈ N with m ≥ |n| + 1.

Furuta's 10/8 Theorem is not yet optimal since it does not quite close the gap between the forms we can realise by smooth manifolds and the forms we can exclude. More precisely, it follows from the calculation of the intersection form of the K3-surface and of S 2 × S 2 that for any n = 2p ∈ Z and every m ≥ 3|p| there exists a closed oriented simply connected 4-dimensional smooth manifold with intersection form isometric to n · E 8 ⊕ m · H. In other words, we have intersection form of p · K3 # (m − 3|p|) · (S 2 × S 2 ) ∼ = 2p · E 8 ⊕ m · H.

The following conjecture predicts that this result is optimal. Conjecture 3.9 (11/8-Conjecture). If M is a closed oriented smooth 4-manifold with indefinite even intersection form, then b 2 (M ) ≥ 11 8 · | sign(M )|. Equivalently, if Q M ∼ = 2p · E 8 ⊕ m · H with p = 0, then m ≥ 3|p|.

Remark 3.10.

(1) A proof of the 11/8-Conjecture would imply, by Freedman's Theorem 11.2, that any closed oriented simply connected smooth 4-manifold is homeomorphic to either a connected sum of the form k · CP 2 # · CP 2 or to a connected sum of the form n · K3#m · (S 2 × S 2 ). (2) Currently the best known result in the direction of the 11/8-Conjecture is [HLSX18, Corollary 1.13], which says that if M is a closed oriented simply-connected 4manifold that is not homeomorphic to S 4 , S 2 × S 2 or the K3-surface and whose intersection form is indefinite and even, then b 2 (M ) ≥ 10 8 · | sign(M )| + 4.


## CW structures

In this chapter we will discuss the existence of CW-structures on manifolds.

Definition 4.1 (CW complex). A CW complex is a topological space X together with a filtration ∅ = X −1 ⊆ X 0 ⊆ X 1 ⊆ X 2 ⊆ · · · with X = colim − −−−− → X n , such that for each n ≥ 0, the space X n arises as a pushout j∈Jn S n−1 / / X n−1 j∈Jn D n / / X n where J n indexes the discs D n . It is implicit in the statement X = colim − −−−− → X n that the topology of X agrees with the weak topology induced from the discs D n . The interiors Int D n of the discs are called the n-cells. For n ≥ 0, a CW complex X is said to be n-dimensional if X n \ X n−1 = ∅ and X i = X i+1 for all i ≥ n. A manifold M admits a CW-structure if M is homeomorphic to a CW complex.

First we discuss the case of smooth manifolds. In [Mun66,Theorem 10.6] and [Whi57,Chapter IV.12] it is shown that every smooth manifold admits a simplicial structure, in particular it admits a CW-structure. Alternatively, it is shown in [Mil63, Section 3] and [Hir94, Section 6.4] that every compact smooth manifold admits a handle decomposition which implies by [Mil63,Theorem 3.5] that every compact smooth manifold is homotopy equivalent to a compact CW-complex.

It is natural to ask whether a similar result holds if we drop the smoothness hypothesis. The next theorem summarises what seems to be the state of the art. (1) For n ≤ 3 every compact n-manifold admits the structure of a finite n-dimensional CW complex.

(2) Let n ≥ 5 and let M be a compact n-manifold. Then M is homeomorphic to the mapping cylinder of some map f : ∂M → X, where X is a finite CW complex.

(3) For n ≥ 5, every closed n-manifold admits the structure of a finite n-dimensional CW complex.

Proof. Radó [Rad26] showed in 1926 that every compact 2-manifold has a simplicial structure and so in particular has a CW structure. Hatcher's exposition [Hat13] is well worth reading. Moise [Moi52,Moi77] proved the analogous result for 3-manifolds. See also [Ham76]. In particular, if M is closed, it admits the structure of a finite n-dimensional CW complex, which shows (3).

It is not clear to us whether Theorem 4.2 suffices to show that every compact highdimensional manifold admits a CW structure. Put differently, to the best of our knowledge the following question is still open for manifolds with nonempty boundary. Casson [AM90,p. xvi] showed in the 1980s that there exist closed 4-manifolds that do not have a simplicial structure. It is now known that in every dimension n ≥ 5, there exists a closed n-manifold that does not admit a simplicial structure. This question was reduced to a problem about homology 3-spheres [Mat78,GS80], which was then solved by Manolescu [Man16]. Note that a simplicial structure is not necessarily a PL structure; an n-dimensional PL structure satisfies the additional condition that the link of an m-simplex be homeomorphic to an (n − m − 1)-dimensional sphere. To the best of our knowledge the following question is still open.

Question 4.4. Does every compact 4-manifold have a CW structure?

We have the following theorem regarding CW structures and manifolds. Given Theorem 4.2, the first statement is only of interest in dimension 4. We are not sure whether the second statement in dimension other than 4 has previously appeared explicitly in the literature.

Theorem 4.5.

(1) Every compact n-manifold is homotopy equivalent to an n-dimensional finite CW complex.

(2) Every connected compact n-manifold with nonempty boundary is homotopy equivalent to an (n − 1)-dimensional finite CW complex.

In the proof of Theorem 4.5 we will use the following theorem proved by Wall [Wal66, Corollary 5.1].

Theorem 4.6. Let X be a finite connected CW complex. Suppose that there is an integer n ≥ 3 such that H i (X; Z[π]) = 0 for all i > n. Then X is homotopy equivalent to an n-dimensional finite CW complex.

The proof of Theorem 4.5 also makes use of the following definition. Recall that a space is metrisable if it admits the structure of a metric space inducing the given topology.

Definition 4.7 (Absolute Neighbourhood Retract (ANR)). A space X is called an absolute neighbourhood retract if X is metrisable and if whenever X ⊆ Y is a closed subset of a metrisable space Y , then X is a neighbourhood retract of Y . That is, there is an open neighbourhood U ⊆ Y containing X, with a map r : U → X such that the composition X → U r − → X is equal to the identity on X.

Proof of Theorem 4.5. Hanner [Han51,Theorem 3.3] showed that every manifold is an ANR, and West [Wes77] showed that every compact ANR is homotopy equivalent to a finite CW complex. (An alternative proof that every compact manifold has the homotopy type of a finite CW complex is given in Kirby-Siebenmann [KS69, Section 1 (III)].)

Let M be a compact n-manifold. By the results above, M is homotopy equivalent to a finite CW complex X. By Theorem 4.2 we need to complete the proof of (1) only in the case n = 4. But since the subsequent argument works for all n ≥ 4 we also state it for all n ≥ 4. Since M is n-dimensional it follows from Universal Poincaré duality (Theorem A.15) that for any k > n and any Z[π 1 (X)]-module Λ we have H k (X; Λ) ∼ = H n−k (X; Λ) = 0.

By Theorem 4.6, X is homotopy equivalent to an n-dimensional finite CW complex. Note that to apply Theorem 4.6 we have used that n ≥ 3. Now we turn to the proof of (2). We start with n = 1, 2 or 3. We saw in the proof of Theorem 4.2 that a compact connected n-manifold admits a simplicial structure. It is well known that a compact connected n-manifold with nonempty boundary and a simplicial structure is homotopy equivalent to an (n−1)-dimensional simplicial complex: collapse top dimensional simplices starting with those that have a face on the boundary. In particular such a manifold is homotopy equivalent to an (n − 1)-dimensional finite CW complex. Now suppose that n ≥ 4. By (1) we know that if M is a connected n-manifold with nonempty boundary, then it admits the structure of a finite CW complex. Let k ≥ n and let Λ be a Z[π 1 (X)]-module. By Poincaré-Lefschetz duality (Section A) we have
H k (X; Λ) ∼ = H n−k (X, ∂X; Λ) = 0.
Here the last conclusion is obvious for k > n. For k = n the conclusion follows from the fact that ∂X = ∅, that X is connected and the explicit calculation of 0-th twisted homology groups as given in [HS97,Chapter VI.3]. It follows from Theorem 4.6 that X is homotopy equivalent to an (n − 1)-dimensional finite CW complex. Note here that to apply Theorem 4.6 we used n ≥ 4.

Theorem 4.5 is strong enough to recover many familiar statements.

Corollary 4.8. Let M be a compact connected manifold.

(1) The group π 1 (M ) is finitely presented.

(2) All homology groups H k (M ; Z) are finitely generated abelian groups, in particular it makes sense to define the Euler characteristic
χ(M ) := n (−1) n · b n (M ).
(3) Let p : M → M be a finite covering. Then Proof. The first two statements in the corollary are an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.5 and standard results on fundamental groups and homology groups of finite CW complexes. We turn to the final statement. Let X be a finite CW complex homotopy equivalent to M . Use the fact that the Euler characteristic is multiplicative for finite covers of finite CW complexes and use that a k-fold cover M of M induces a k-fold cover X of X such that M and X are homotopy equivalent, to deduce the result.
χ( M ) = [ M : M ] · χ(M
Remark 4.10. As pointed out above, every compact smooth manifold admits the structure of a finite CW complex. One can combine this fact with Theorem 8.6 below to obtain an alternative proof of Corollary 4.8. Theorem 8.6 says that for any 4-manifold M there is a 4-manifold N such that the connected sum M #N admits a smooth structure.


## The annulus theorem

The annulus theorem is a fundamental result in the development of the theory of manifolds. In high dimensions, it underpins the product structure theorem [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.1], which itself underpins all the results of [KS77]. We state the product structure theorem in Section 5.4. In dimension four, the annulus theorem is needed for the proofs of smoothing theorems (Section 8), existence and uniqueness of normal bundles (Section 6), and transversality (Section 10). We discuss these developments in later sections. Later in this section (Section 5.2), we will discuss a more immediate application: showing that connected sum is a well-defined operation on connected topological manifolds. Here is the annulus theorem.

Theorem 5.1 (Annulus theorem). Let n ∈ N and let f, g : D n → R n be two orientationpreserving locally flat embeddings.
If f (D n ) ⊂ Int(g(D n )), then g(D n ) \ Int(f (D n )) is homeomorphic to S n−1 × [0, 1].
For n = 2, 3 the annulus theorem follows from the work of Radó [Rad26] and Moise [Moi52,Moi77] (see also [Edw84,p. 247]). The annulus theorem was proved for dimensions = 4 by Kirby [Kir69] and in dimension 4 by Quinn [Qui82,p. 506]; see also [Edw84,p. 247].

The known proofs of the annulus theorem deduce it from the stable homeomorphism theorem. In the next section we will state the stable homeomorphism theorem 5.3 and we will show how the annulus theorem can be deduced from that theorem.

5.1. The stable homeomorphism theorem. We reduce the annulus theorem to the stable homeomorphisms theorem stated in Theorem 5.3. This follows from work of Brown and Gluck [BG64b], but since it requires some work to find this deduction in [BG64b], we give the details here.

Definition 5.2. A homeomorphism f : R n → R n is said to be stable if there is a sequence of homeomorphisms f 1 , . . . , f n : R n → R n such that f n • · · · • f 1 = f and such that for each i, the homeomorphism f i is somewhere the identity, which means that there is an open nonempty set U ⊆ R n such that f i | U is the identity on U .

The key ingredient to the subsequent discussion is the following theorem.

Theorem 5.3 (Stable homeomorphism theorem). Let n ∈ N. Every orientation preserving homeomorphism from R n to itself is stable.

For n ≥ 5 this was proved by Kirby [Kir69,p. 575]. Slightly more precisely, Kirby [Kir69] showed that the stable homeomorphism theorem in dimensions at least five is a consequence of the surgery theoretic classification of PL homotopy tori which had been worked out by Wall [Wal70],[Wal99, Section 15A] and independently by Hsiang-Shaneson [HS69, p. 688], both proofs building on the work of Browder, Novikov and Wall. For n = 4 the stable homeomorphism theorem was proven by Quinn, see also [Edw84,p. 247].

Before we discuss consequences of the Stable homeomorphism theorem 5.3 we recall the two versions of the Alexander trick.

Lemma 5.4 (Alexander trick).

(1) Every homeomorphism of S n−1 can be extended radially to a homeomorphism of D n that sends 0 to 0.

(2) Let f and g be two homeomorphisms of D n . If the restrictions of f and g to S n−1 are isotopic, then f and g are isotopic homeomorphisms of D n .

The extension in the first statement can be obtained by coning: f (t · x) = t · f (x). The second one is an amusing exercise; see [Han89,Lemma 5.6] for a proof. The same idea extends to show that the topological group Homeo ∂ (D n ) of homeomorphisms of D n fixing the boundary pointwise is contractible.

We can now prove the following almost immediate consequence of the Stable homeomorphism theorem 5.3.

Corollary 5.5. Every orientation preserving self-homeomorphism of S n is isotopic to the identity.

Proof. We identify S n with R n ∪ {∞}. Let h be a self-homeomorphism of S n = R n ∪ {∞}. After an isotopy (using Theorem 2.10) we can assume that h(∞) = ∞. By the Stable homeomorphism theorem 5.3 we know that h is stable. Thus we only have to consider the case that h fixes an open subset of R n ∪ {∞} = S n . After an isotopy we can assume that h fixes an open neighbourhood of ∞, so in particular there exists C > 0 such that h is the identity on {x ∈ R n | x ≥ C}. It follows from Lemma 5.4 (2) that h is isotopic to the identity.

Denote the set of locally flat embeddings of D n into R n by Emb(D n , R n ); see Definition 6.2 for the definition of locally flat.

Definition 5.6. We say that two elements
f 0 , f 1 ∈ Emb(D n , R n ) are intertwined if there exists an h ∈ Homeo(R n , R n ) with h • f 0 = f 1 .
We will need the following straightforward technical lemma. Proof. Let f : D n → M be a locally flat embedding. By definition f (D n ) is a submanifold of M . It is straightforward to see that W := M \ f (Int D n ) is also a submanifold of M . By the collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5 there exists a collar f (S n−1 ) × [0, 1]. The map
F : R n → M x → f (x), if x ∈ D n , f (y), 2 π arctan(t − 1) if x = t · y with t ∈ [1, ∞) and y ∈ S n−1 ,
is easily seen to be a locally flat embedding.

Lemma 5.8. Any two elements f 0 , f 1 ∈ Emb(D n , R n ) are intertwined.

Proof. It suffices to show that any f ∈ Emb(D n , R n ) is intertwined with the standard embedding D n ⊂ R n . So let f ∈ Emb(D n , R n ). Apply Lemma 5.7 to extend f to a locally flat embedding F : D n ( 3 2 ) → R n . Note that F restricts to a locally flat embedding of S n−1 × [ 1 2 , 3 2 ] into S n = R n ∪ {∞}. Let D n be another copy of D n . By the generalised Schoenflies theorem [Bro60, Theorem 5] there exists a homeomorphism g : D n → S n \ f (Int D n ). Since the homeomorphisms of D n act transitively on the interior of D n , arrange that g(0) = ∞.

Note that g −1 • f : S n−1 → S n−1 is a homeomorphism. By Lemma 5.4 (1) this homeomorphism extends to a homeomorphism φ of D n . Replace g by g • φ if necessary to obtain that f = g : S n−1 → f (S n−1 ). Identify S n = R n ∪ {∞} = D n ∪ D n in such a way that 0 ∈ D n corresponds precisely to ∞. Consider the map
F : S n = D n ∪ D n → S n x → f (x) x ∈ D n g(x) x ∈ D n .
The maps f and g agree on the overlap, so the map is well-defined and is a homeomorphism. Note that F restricts to a homeomorphism of R n which has the property that the restriction to D n equals f . This shows that F • Id = f so Id and f are intertwined.
Definition 5.9. Let f 0 , f 1 ∈ Emb(D n , R n ) with f 0 (D n ) ⊂ Int f 1 (D n )
. We say f 0 and f 1 are strictly annularly equivalent if there exists a map F : S n−1 × I → M that is a homeomorphism onto its image such that F (x, 0) = f 0 (x) and F (x, 1) = f 1 (x) for all x ∈ S n−1 .
Theorem 5.10. Let f 0 , f 1 ∈ Emb(D n , R n ) with f 0 (D n ) ⊂ Int f 1 (D n ).
If f 0 and f 1 are orientation preserving, then they are strictly annularly equivalent if and only if they are intertwined.

Proof. If two such elements are strictly annularly equivalent, then they are intertwined by [BG64b,Theorem 5.2]. Now suppose that f 0 and f 1 are intertwined, that is there exists an h ∈ Homeo(R n , R n ) with h • f 0 = f 1 . By the Stable homeomorphism theorem 5.3 we know that h is stable. Thus we know from [BG64b,Theorem 5.4] that the embeddings are annularly equivalent, i.e. there exist h 0 , . . . , h k ∈ Emb(D n , R n ) such that h 0 = f 0 , h k = f 1 and for each i the maps h i and h i+1 are strictly annularly equivalent. Since f 0 (D n ) ⊂ Int f 1 (D n ), the embeddings of the boundary spheres f 0 (∂D n ) and f 1 (∂D n ) are disjoint. Therefore it follows from [BG64a,Theorem 3.5] that f 0 and f 1 are not only annularly equivalent, but are moreover strictly annularly equivalent. Now we can easily prove the Annulus theorem 5.1.

Proof of the Annulus theorem 5.1. Let f 0 , f 1 : D n → R n be two orientation-preserving locally flat embeddings with f 0 (D n ) ⊂ Int(f 1 (D n )). By Lemma 5.8 and Theorem 5.10 the two maps f 0 and f 1 are strictly annularly equivalent. But this immediately implies that
f 1 (D n ) \ Int(f 0 (D n )) is homeomorphic to S n−1 × [0, 1].
5.2. The connected sum operation. We recall the construction of the connected sum of two connected oriented n-manifolds M and N . Pick two orientation preserving locally flat embeddings of n-balls Φ M : D n → M and Φ N : D n → N . Define the connected sum M #N of M and N by
M #N := (M \ Φ M (Int(D n ))) ∪ Φ M (S n−1 )=Φ N (S n−1 ) (N \ Φ N (Int(D n )))
where we glue the left hand side to the right hand side via the map
Φ N • Φ −1 M : Φ M (S n−1 ) ∼ = − → Φ N (S n−1 ).
It follows from the Collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5 that the topological space M #N inherits the structure of an n-manifold; see [Lee11, Proposition 6.6] for details. Furthermore M #N can be oriented in such a way that M and N are oriented submanifolds.

Theorem 5.11. The connected sum M #N of two connected oriented n-manifolds M and N is independent of the choice of embeddings of the n-balls.

Remark 5.12. The manifolds CP 2 #CP 2 and CP 2 #CP 2 have different intersection forms, so they are not homeomorphic; see Proposition 5.15. Thus connected sum is not welldefined on orientable 4-manifolds, rather it depends on the choice of orientation. On the other hand for nonorientable manifolds, the connected sum is well-defined. As discussed in [BCF + 19], in contrast to the case of orientable 3-dimensional manifolds, orientable 4dimensional topological manifolds do not admit a unique decomposition as a connected sum of irreducible 4-manifolds.

The proof of Theorem 5.11 relies on the following two lemmas. The elementary proof of the first lemma is left to the reader.

Lemma 5.13. Let D n r (x) and D n s (y) be two Euclidean balls in R n . There exists a homeomorphism f : R n → R n with f (D n r (x)) = D n s (y) such that f is the identity outside of some compact set.

The next lemma is a consequence of the annulus theorem 5.1.

Lemma 5.14. Let ϕ, ψ : D n → R n be two orientation-preserving locally flat embeddings. If ϕ(D n ) ⊂ Int(ψ(D n )), then there exists a homeomorphism f of R n with f (ϕ(D n )) = ψ(D n ) such that f is the identity outside of some compact set.

Proof. By the annulus theorem 5.1 and the collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5 we can find a locally flat embedding θ : S n−1 × [−1, 2] such that θ(S n−1 × [−1, 0]) is a collar for ϕ(D n ), such that θ(S n−1 × [0, 1]) = ψ(D n ) \ ϕ(Int D n ) and such that θ(S n−1 × [1, 2]) is a collar for R n \ ψ(Int D n ). It is now obvious that we can find a homeomorphism f with f (ϕ(D n )) = ψ(D n ) which is the identity outside of θ(S n−1 × [−1, 2]).

The subsequent proof is partly based on the sketch given in [Rol90,p. 42].

Proof of Theorem 5.11. We have to show that the connected sum is independent of the choice of Φ M : D n → M and Ψ N : D n → N . By symmetry and transitivity it suffices to show that the connected sum is independent of the choice of Φ M . So suppose we are given two orientation-preserving embeddings Φ 1 : D n → M and Φ 2 : D n → M and suppose we are given an orientation-preserving embedding Ψ : D n → N . We introduce the following notation.

(1) Write D i := Φ i (D n ).

(2) Let X i := M \ Φ i (Int D n ) and let Y := N \ Ψ(Int D n ), (3) Denote the restriction of Φ i to S n−1 by ϕ i and denote the restriction of Ψ to S n−1 by ψ. Figure 1 hopefully makes it easier for the reader to internalise the notation. We have to show that there exists a homeomorphism
(X 1 ∪ Y )/ϕ 1 (x) ∼ ψ(x) → (X 2 ∪ Y )/ϕ 2 (x) ∼ ψ(x)
where the gluing on both sides is given by taking x ∈ S n−1 .  
M Ψ X ψ C ϕ 1 D 2 Φ 1 Φ 2 D 1 Figure 1.
Claim. There exists a homeomorphism h of M so that h(D 1 ) = D 2 .

First note that it follows from Lemma 5.7 and Lemma 5.13, together with our hypothesis that M is path connected, that there exists a homeomorphism µ of M such that µ(D 1 ) ⊂ Int D 2 . Then apply Lemma 5.7 and Lemma 5.14 to find a homeomorphism ν of M such that ν(µ(D 1 )) = D 2 . This concludes the proof of the claim.

It follows from the claim that ϕ −1 2 • ϕ 1 is a homeomorphism of S n−1 . By Corollary 5.5 we know that there exists an isotopy H : S n−1 × [0, 1] → S n−1 from ϕ −1 2 • ϕ 1 to the identity. We write C := Φ(S n−1 ). By the collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5 we can pick a collar C × [0, 1] for Y . It is straightforward to verify that
(X 1 ∪ Y )/ϕ 1 (x) ∼ ψ(x) → (X 2 ∪ Y )/ϕ 2 (x) ∼ ψ(x) P →    h(P ), if P ∈ X 1 , ψ(H(ψ −1 (Q), t)) if P = (Q, t) ∈ C × [0, 1] P, if Y \ P ∈ C × [0, 1]
is a well-defined map and is a homeomorphism. This shows that the connected sums defined using Φ 1 and Φ 2 give rise to homeomorphic manifolds.


## 5.3.

Further results on connected sums. The definition of the intersection form was given in Definition 3.1. The next proposition shows that the intersection form is well behaved under the connected sum operation.

Proposition 5.15. Let M and N be two oriented compact 4-manifolds.
Then Q M #N is isometric to Q M ⊕ Q N .
Proof. In the smooth case this statement follows immediately from the fact that any class in second homology can be represented by an embedded oriented submanifold [GS99, Proposition 1.2.3] and the fact that one can calculate the intersection form in terms of algebraic intersection numbers of embedded oriented surfaces [Bre97, Theorem VI.11.9]. To apply this approach to general manifolds, one needs to use topological transversality, which holds, as discussed in Section 10.

On the other hand the statement for general manifolds (and thus also for smooth manifolds) can be proved directly with the usual tools of algebraic topology, namely functoriality of the cup and cap products [Bre97, Theorem VI.5.2.(4)] for maps between pairs of topological spaces, a Mayer-Vietoris argument and the excision theorem. Full details are provided in [Fri19, Proposition 72.11].

5.4. The product structure theorem. The product structure theorem [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.1], is a key result for the development of topological manifold theory in high dimensions. It is a consequence of the stable homeomorphism theorem 5.3, and in turn is used in [KS77] to deduce handle structures, transversality, smoothing theory, and the existence of a canonical simple homotopy type, for high dimensional (n ≥ 6) manifolds. We will give some examples of the use of the product structure theorem below. Even though it is only for high dimensional manifolds, it still appears in the development of the theory of 4-manifolds.

The product structure theorem will be stated for upgrading to either a smooth or PL structure. A concordance of (smooth, PL) structures Σ, Σ on a manifold N is a (smooth, PL) structure Ω on N × I that restricts to Σ on N × {0} and restricts to Σ on N × {1}.

Theorem 5.16 (Product structure theorem). Let M be a manifold of dimension n ≥ 5. Let Σ be a (smooth, PL) structure on M × R s , with s ≥ 1. Let U be an open subset of M with a (smooth, PL) structure ρ on U such that ρ × R s = Σ| U ×R s . If n = 5 then suppose that ∂M ⊂ U .

Then there is a (smooth, PL) structure σ on M extending ρ, together with a concordance of (smooth,PL) structures from Σ to σ × R s , that is a product concordance in some neighbourhood of U × R s and that is a product near M × R s × {i} for i = 0, 1.

Remark 5.17. The statement of the product structure theorem was modelled on the Cairns-Hirsch theorem [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.3], which was proven in the early 1960s, and provided the analogous upgrade from PL structures to smooth structures. See [HM74] for a comprehensive treatment of smoothing theory for PL manifolds. The Cairns-Hirsch theorem tells us that if M already has a PL structure , such that × R s is Whitehead compatible (see the discussion below [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.3] for details) with a smooth structure Σ on M × R s , then the smooth structure σ on M produced by Theorem 5.16 is Whitehead compatible with .

In Section 14.1 on the simple homotopy type of a manifold we make use of the following stronger local version. (
1) A (smooth, PL) structure Σ on W that equals Σ on (W \ V ) ∪ ((C × R s ) ∩ W )
and is a product (smooth,PL) structure ρ×R s on (N (D)×R s )∩W for some neighbourhood N (D) of D and for some (smooth, PL) structure ρ on N (D).

(2) A concordance of (smooth, PL) structures from Σ to Σ , that is a product concordance on some neighbourhood of (W \ V ) ∪ ((C × R s ) ∩ W ) and that is a product near W × {i} for i = 0, 1.

Note that the concordance implies isotopy theorem [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 4.1] means that the concordances in Theorems 5.16 and 5.18 can be upgraded to isotopies of (smooth, PL) structures under the same hypotheses on dimensions, that is n ≥ 6 or n = 5 and the structures already agree on ∂M .

6. Tubular neighbourhoods 6.1. Submanifolds. Every smooth submanifold of a smooth manifold admits a normal vector bundle and, by the smooth Tubular neighbourhood theorem, also admits a tubular neighbourhood [Hir94, Sections 5 & 6][Wal16, Chapter 2.5]. However in the topological category n-manifolds may not admit normal vector bundles, a general problem we discuss further below and in Section 7 once we have developed the necessary language. Curiously, in the special case of 4-manifolds these general problems do not exist, and familiar smooth results hold true using an appropriate notion of normal vector bundles (Definition 6.15).

Before discussing tubular neighbourhoods and normal vector bundles in the topological category, we give our convention for submanifolds. Recall that E n−1 ⊂ R n is the hyperplane {x n = 0}.

Definition 6.1. Let M be an n-dimensional manifold. We say a subset X ⊂ M is a k-dimensional submanifold if given any P ∈ X one of the holds:

(1) there exists a chart Φ : U → V of type (i) for M and P such that
Φ(U ∩ X) ⊂ {(0, . . . , 0, x 1 , . . . , x k ) | x i ∈ R},
(2) there exists a chart Φ : U → V of type (ii) for M and P such that Φ(P ) lies in E n−1 and Φ(U ∩ X) ⊂ {(0, . . . , 0, x 1 , . . . , x k ) ∈ R n | x k ≥ 0},

(3) or there exists a chart Φ : U → V of type (i) for M and P such that Φ(P ) lies in E n−1 and
Φ(U ∩ X) ⊂ {(0, . . . , 0, x 1 , . . . , x k ) ∈ R n | x k ≥ 0}.
If for every P ∈ X we can find charts as in (1) and (2), then we call M a proper submanifold. (2) In point set topology, one often defines a topological embedding to be a map f : X → Y of topological spaces that is a homeomorphism to its image. The image of a topological embedding is not necessarily a submanifold and such an image is sometimes called wild due to the bizarre properties that such objects can exhibit. For example, the famous Alexander horned sphere [Ale24] is not a submanifold of S 3 under Definition 6.1, but it is the image of a wild topological embedding S 2 → S 3 . (3) In the literature a compact subset F of 4-manifold is often called a locally flat surface if F is homeomorphic to a compact 2-dimensional manifold with ∂F = F ∩ ∂M and if F has the following properties. (a) Given any P ∈ F \ ∂F there exists a topological embedding ϕ :
D 2 × D 2 → M \ ∂M with ϕ(D 2 × D 2 ) ∩ F = ϕ(D 2 × {0}
) and with P ∈ ϕ(D 2 × {0}). (b) Given any P ∈ ∂F there exists a topological embedding ϕ :
D 2 ≥0 ×D 2 → M such that ϕ(D 2 ≥0 × D 2 ) ∩ F = ϕ(D 2 ≥0 × {0}), ϕ(D 2 ≥0 × D 2 ) ∩ ∂M = ϕ(∂ y=0 D 2 ≥0 × D 2 ), and with P ∈ ϕ(D 2 ≥0 × {0}).
Here, we used the following abbreviations D 2 ≥0 = {(x, y) ∈ D 2 | y ≥ 0} and ∂ y=0 D 2 = {(x, 0) ∈ D 2 }. It follows easily from the definitions that F ⊂ M is a locally flat surface if and only if F is proper submanifold of M .

The following is a common justification for requiring slice discs to be locally flat in the theory of knot concordance.

Proposition 6.4. Given a knot K ⊂ S 3 the corresponding cone
Cone(K) := {r · Q | Q ∈ K and r ∈ [0, 1]} ⊂ D 4 .
is locally flat if and only if K is the unknot.

Proof. Consider the specific unknot U that is the equator of the equator U = S 1 ⊂ S 2 ⊂ S 3 = ∂D 4 . Taking the cone radially inwards to the origin of D 4 exhibits cone(U ) as a locally flatly (properly) embedded disc. Any other unknotted K ⊂ S 3 is related to U by a homeomorphism of S 3 . By the Alexander trick 5.4(1), this homeomorphism extends radially inwards to a homeomorphism of D 4 fixing the origin. Thus the cone on any other unknot K is locally flatly embedded, as we obtain a chart as in Definition 6.1(1) at the origin of D 4 .

Conversely, suppose K ⊂ S 3 is a knot such that C := Cone(K) is locally flat. This implies that there is a chart Φ : D 4 → D 4 such that Φ(0) = P and such that Φ(D 2 × {0}) = Φ(D 4 ) ∩ C. We introduce the following notation. An elementary argument shows that there exist s 1 < t 1 < s 2 < t 2 < s 3 such that
D [0,s 1 ] ⊂ N [0,t 1 ] ⊂ D [0,s 2 ] ⊂ N [0,t 2 ] ⊂ D [0,s 3 ] .
We make the following observations:

(1) For any I ⊂ [0, 1] we have homeomorphisms D I \ C ∼ = (S 3 \ K) × I and N I \ C
Φ −1 − − → D I \ U ∼ = (S 3 \ U ) × I.
(2) For any inclusion I ⊂ J of intervals the inclusion induced maps D I → D J and N I → N J are homotopy equivalences.

We consider the following commutative diagram where all maps are induced by inclusions
π 1 (S 3 \ K) ∼ = π 1 (D {t 2 } \ C) ∼ = * * / / π 1 (N [t 1 ,t 2 ] \ C) ∼ = Z u u π 1 (D [t 1 ,t 3 ] \ C).
Since the inclusion D {t 2 } \ C → D [t 1 ,t 3 ] \ C is a homotopy equivalence we see that the left diagonal map is an isomorphism. Thus we see that we have an automorphism of π 1 (S 3 \ K) that factors through Z. Since the abelianisation of π 1 (S 3 \ K) is isomorphic to Z we see that π 1 (S 3 \K) ∼ = Z. It follows from the Loop Theorem that K is in fact the unknot [Rol90, Theorem 4.B.1].

In some applications one needs the following refinement of the Collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5. Theorem 6.5 (Collar neighbourhood theorem for proper submanifolds). Let M be a manifold and let X ⊂ M be a proper submanifold. There exists a collar neighbourhood ∂M ×[0, 1] such that (∂M × [0, 1]) ∩ X is a collar neighbourhood for ∂X ⊂ X.

Proof. By the earlier Collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5 we can pick a collar neighbourhood ∂M × [0, 2] for ∂M and we can also pick a collar neighbourhood ∂X × [0, 2] for ∂X. Given t ∈ [0, 1] we consider the obvious homeomorphisms
f t : M = (M \ (∂M × [0, 2))) ∪ (∂M × [0, 2]) → (M \ (∂M × [0, 2))) ∪ (∂M × [t, 2])
and
g t : X = (X \ (∂X × [0, 2))) ∪ (∂X × [0, 2]) → (X \ (∂X × [0, 2))) ∪ (∂X × [t, 2]).
Next we consider the following proper locally flat isotopy:  h 1 (X) X Figure 3. Illustration of the proof of the Collar neighbourhood theorem 6.5. 6.2. Tubular neighbourhoods: existence and uniqueness. In the literature one can find many different definitions of tubular neighbourhoods for smooth manifolds. We will give a definition for manifolds that is modelled on the definition provided by Wall [Wal16] for smooth manifolds. To do so we first need one extra definition.
h : X × [0, 1] → M (x, t) → (y, s) ∈ ∂M × [0, t], if x = (y, s) with y ∈ ∂X, s ∈ [0, t], f t (g −1 t (x)),
Definition 6.6. Let M be an n-dimensional manifold. We say a subset W ⊂ M is a k-dimensional submanifold with corners if given any P ∈ W there exists a chart of the type (1), (2) or (3) as in Definition 6.1 above, or if (4) there exists a chart Φ : U → V of type (ii) for M such that
Φ(U ∩ W ) ⊂ {(0, . . . , 0, x 1 , . . . , x k ) | x i ∈ R with x k−1 ≥ 0 and x k ≥ 0}
and with Φ(P ) ∈ {(0, . . . , 0, x 1 , . . . , x k−2 , 0, 0) | x i ∈ R}.

If W is an n-dimensional submanifold with corners we write 
∂ 0 W := W ∩ M \ W ,corner x k−1 x k M M ∂ 1 W ∂M W ∂ 0 W Figure 4.
Definition 6.7. Let M be an n-manifold and let X be a compact proper k-dimensional submanifold. A tubular neighbourhood for X is a pair (N, p : N → X) with the following properties:

(1) N is a codimension zero submanifold with corners.

(2) The map p : N → X is a linear D n−k -bundle such that p(x) = x for all x ∈ X.

(3) We have ∂ 1 N = p −1 (∂X).

Here linear means that there exists an atlas of trivialisations such that the transition maps take values in O(n − k) instead of Homeo(D n−k ).

In the topological category, tubular neighbourhoods do not always exist. Indeed it is shown in [Hir68,Theorem 4] that there exists a 4-dimensional submanifold of S 7 that does not admit a tubular neighbourhood.

Fortunately, for submanifolds of 4-manifolds, tubular neighbourhoods exist and they are unique in the appropriate sense.

Theorem 6.8 (Tubular neighbourhood theorem). Every compact proper submanifold X of a 4-manifold M admits a tubular neighbourhood. Theorem 6.9. (Uniqueness of tubular neighbourhoods) Let M be a 4-manifold and let X be a compact proper k-dimensional submanifold. Furthermore let p i : N i → X, i = 1, 2 be two tubular neighbourhoods of X, with inclusion maps ι i : N i → M . Then there exists an isomorphism Ψ : N 1 → N 2 of linear disc bundles such that ι 2 •Ψ : N 1 → M and ι 1 : N 2 → M are ambiently isotopic rel X.

The proofs of the above two theorems rely on the existence and uniqueness results for normal vector bundles in [FQ90, Section 9], which we discuss further in Section 6.3. Thus we postpone the proofs of the above two theorems to Section 6.4.

Right now, let us first observe some nice consequences of the existence and uniqueness of tubular neighbourhoods.

Remark 6.10. Let X be a compact proper submanifold of a 4-manifold M . By Theorem 6.8 we can pick a tubular neighbourhood p : N → X. We refer to E X := M \ Int N as the exterior of X. By Theorem 6.9 the homeomorphism type of the exterior is well-defined.

Lemma 6.11. Let X be a compact proper submanifold of a 4-manifold M . The exterior E X of X is a deformation retract of the complement M \ X.

Proof. Let p : N → X be a tubular neighbourhood for X. Using the fact that p is a linear bundle, introduce compatible radial coordinates in the fibres and isotope radially outwards. This implies that ∂ 0 N is a deformation retract of N \ X. But this also implies that the exterior E X = M \ N is a deformation retract of M \ X.

Corollary 6.12. Let X be a submanifold of a compact 4-manifold M . If X is compact, then π 1 (M \ X) and H * (M \ X) are finitely generated.

Proof. It follows from Lemma 6.11 that M \ X is homotopy equivalent to the exterior of X which in our case is a compact 4-manifold since we assume that M is compact. The corollary is now a consequence of Corollary 4.8.

Proposition 6.13. Let X ⊂ M be a 2-dimensional orientable submanifold of a compact orientable 4-manifold M , such that each connected component of X has nonempty boundary. Then the tubular neighbourhood of Theorem 6.8 is homeomorphic to X × D 2 .

Proof. A linear D n -bundle is the unit disc bundle of a vector bundle. Connected surfaces with boundary are homotopy equivalent to wedges of circles. Every orientable vector space bundle over a wedge of circles is trivial, and so are their unit disc bundles.

6.3. Normal vector bundles. The reader will be familiar with the definition of a normal vector bundle when working in the smooth category: if X ⊂ M is a smooth submanifold of a smooth manifold, then the normal vector bundle is the quotient vector bundle T M | X /T X. This definition uses the smooth structure to ensure the existence of tangent vector bundles, and vector bundles are a strong enough bundle technology to ensure the existence the perpendicular subspaces required to form the quotient bundle. While some (weaker) canonical tangential structures do exist in the topological category (see Section 7), the idea of 'quotient bundle' no longer makes sense for them.

In the topological category, following [FQ90, Section 9], we will use a definition of normal vector bundle that is much closer to the geometry of tubular neighbourhoods. We begin with a definition that is almost what we need but suffers from a slight technical problem, which we then remedy.

Definition 6.14. Let M be a n-manifold and let X be a proper k-dimensional submanifold. An internal linear bundle over X is a pair (E, p : E → X) with the following properties:

(1) E is a codimension zero submanifold of M .

(2) The map p : E → X is an (n − k)-dimensional vector bundle such that p(x) = x for all x ∈ X.

(3) We have ∂E = p −1 (∂X).

An internal linear bundle (E, p : E → X) is intended to recover, from the smooth category, an open tubular neighbourhood of X. As such, the definition as stands suffers from the potential technical problem that the closure of E in M , which should be a closed tubular neighbourhood, may be an immersion; see Figure 5. As in [FQ90,p. 137], we use the following additional idea to rule out this problem.

Definition 6.15. Let M be an n-manifold, let X be a proper k-dimensional submanifold, and let (E, p : E → X) be an internal linear bundle over X. Suppose that given any (n − k)-dimensional vector bundle (F, q : F → X), any radial homeomorphism from an open convex disc bundle of F to E can be extended to a homeomorphism from the whole of F to a neighbourhood of E. Then we say (E, p : E → X) is extendable.

In Figure 5 we illustrate an example of a non-extendable internal linear bundle. 
radial homeomorphism F M X disk bundle in F the closure of E touches itself X E Figure 5.
Now we can define the notion of a normal vector bundle.

Definition 6.16 ([FQ90, p. 137]). Let M be a n-manifold and let X be a proper kdimensional submanifold. A normal vector bundle for X is an internal linear bundle that is extendable.

Theorem 6.17 (Existence of normal vector bundles). Every proper submanifold of a compact 4-manifold admits a normal vector bundle.

Remark 6.18. Generally, the existence of normal vector bundles is peculiar to when the submanifolds has low dimension or low codimension. We refer the reader to [FQ90, Section 9.4] for a discussion of the other known situations where these objects always exist. Here is a summary of the known cases. A submanifold of dimension at most 3 in a closed manifold of dimension at least 5 has a normal bundle, and codimension one submanifolds have normal bundles [Bro62]. That every codimension two submanifold of a manifold of dimension not equal to four have normal bundles was shown in [KS75], and this was extended to include dimension four in [FQ90, Section 9.3]. It is striking that, while among smooth manifolds dimension 4 exhibits worse than usual behaviour, in the topological category the existence of normal vector bundles seems to show it is among the better behaved of the dimensions.

For the proof of Theorem 6.17 we will essentially appeal to [FQ90,Theorem 9.3A] and [FQ90, Theorem 9.3D]; the former deals with existence while the latter deals with uniqueness. We reproduce this theorem here for the benefit of the reader.

Theorem 6.19. Let N be a submanifold of a 4-manifold M , with a closed subset K ⊆ N \ ∂N and a normal bundle over some neighbourhood of K in N . Then there is a normal bundle over N that agrees with the given one over the neighbourhood of K. Moreover this extension is unique up to ambient isotopy relative to some neighbourhood of K.

Proof. Let X be a proper submanifold of a compact 4-manifold M . The case that X has no boundary is dealt with in [FQ90, Theorem 9.3A]. The case that X has nonempty boundary follows also from [FQ90, Theorem 9.3A] if we apply more care. We sketch the argument.

First, in dimension three the topological and the smooth category are the same. Thus we can view the submanifold ∂X ⊂ ∂M as a smooth submanifold. Hence it has a smooth normal vector bundle e.g. [Kos93, Chapter III.2] or [Lan02b, Section IV.5].

Next use the Collar neighbourhood theorem 6.5 to obtain a collar ∂M × [0, 1] ⊂ M that restricts to a collar ∂X × [0, 1] for the boundary of X. Extend the smooth tubular neighbourhood of ∂X ⊂ ∂M into the collar by taking a product with [0, 1].

Finally, consider the 4-manifold without boundary M :
= M \ (∂M × [0, 1 2 ]). What remains of X is a submanifold N := X \ (∂X × [0, 1 2 ])
. The submanifold N already has a preferred normal vector bundle on the closed subset K := ∂X × (1/2, 1]. Now apply [FQ90,Theorem 9.3A] to the triple (M , N, K) to obtain a normal vector bundle E → N agreeing with the given one on K. The normal vector bundles over N and ∂X × [0, 1] agree on the overlap K. Thus they define a normal vector bundle on all of X. Next we turn to the uniqueness of normal vector bundles.

Theorem 6.20 (Uniqueness of normal vector bundles). Let M be a compact 4-manifold and let X be a proper submanifold of M . Suppose we are given two normal vector bundles
p i : E i → X, i = 1, 2 for X. For i = 1, 2 let ι i : E i → M be the inclusion map. Then there exists a bundle isomorphism f : E 1 ∼ = − → E 2 such that ι 2 • f and ι 1 are ambiently isotopic rel. X.
Proof. If X has no boundary, then the theorem is an immediate consequence of [FQ90, Theorem 9.3D]. Now suppose that X has nonempty boundary.

First we claim that any normal vector bundle of X is obtained by the construction outlined in the proof of Theorem 6.17. To see this, let p : E → X be a normal vector bundle. Pick a collar neighbourhood ∂X × [0, 2] ⊂ X. Since p is extendable, we can view p as the interior of a disc bundle q :
F → X in M . Write C := q −1 (∂X) ⊆ ∂M . The disc bundle q : q −1 (∂X × [0, 2]) → ∂X × [0, 2] defines a collar neighbourhood C × [0, 2]
for the compact submanifold C of ∂M . By the collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5 we can extend the collar neighbourhood C ×[0, 1] of C to a collar neighbourhood ∂M ×[0, 1]. With this choice of collar neighbourhood of ∂M , the construction in the proof of Theorem 6.17, with further appropriate choices, gives rise to the normal vector bundle p : E → X. This completes the proof of the claim.

After this long preamble it suffices to prove the theorem for any two normal vector bundles obtained as in the proof of Theorem 6.17. Uniqueness follows by arguing that each step in the proof of existence of normal vector bundles was essentially unique. The proofs of uniqueness in the three steps make use of the following ingredients.

First, apply the uniqueness statement for normal vector bundles of submanifolds of smooth manifolds to ∂X ⊆ ∂M e.g. [Kos93, Chapter III.2] or [Lan02b, Section IV.5].

Next use the uniqueness of collar neighbourhoods as formulated in Theorem 2.7, applied to the two collar neighbourhoods of ∂M subordinate to the given normal bundles of X.

Finally apply the full relative version of [FQ90,Theorem 9.3D] to extend the normal vector bundle uniquely over the rest of X.

6.4. Tubular neighbourhoods: proofs. Now we will use the results from the previous section to prove the existence and uniqueness of tubular neighbourhoods. First we show how one can obtain tubular neighbourhoods from normal vector bundles.

Definition 6.21. Let p : E → X be a vector bundle. Given x ∈ X, write E x := p −1 (x). A positive definite form g = {g x } x∈X consists of a positive definite form g x for every E x such that g x changes continuously with x.

The following lemma follows from standard techniques, so we leave it to the reader to fill in the details.

Lemma 6.22. Let X be a compact manifold and let p : E → X be an n-dimensional vector bundle. Then the space of positive definite forms on E is nonempty and convex. Furthermore, let g = {g x } x∈X be a positive definite form on E and consider the map
p : E(g) := x∈X {v ∈ E x | g x (v, v) ≤ 1} → X.
This map has the following properties:

(1) The map p : E(g) → X is a linear D n -bundle.

(2) Given two different positive definite forms g and h on E there exists an isotopy of the vector bundle E sending E(g) to E(h), and restricting to the identity on the 0-section and outside some compact subset of E.

Let X be a compact manifold and let p : E → X be a vector bundle. Given any positive definite form g we refer to
p : E := x∈X {v ∈ E x | g x (v, v) ≤ 1} → X
as a corresponding disc bundle. It follows from Lemma 6.22 that for most purposes the precise choice of g is irrelevant.

We can now prove the existence of tubular neighbourhoods.

Proof of the tubular neighbourhood theorem 6.8. Let X be a compact proper submanifold of a 4-manifold M . By Theorem 6.17 there exists a normal vector bundle p : N → X for X. A choice of corresponding disc bundle is easily seen to be a tubular neighbourhood.

The uniqueness proof for tubular neighbourhoods also requires us to associate a normal vector bundle to a tubular neighbourhood.

Lemma 6.23. Let M be a compact 4-manifold and let X be a compact proper k-dimensional submanifold. Let p : N → X be a tubular neighbourhood for X. There exists a normal vector bundle q : E → X and a positive definite form g such that N = E(g) and p : N → X equals q : E(g) → X.

Proof. Let p : N → X be a tubular neighbourhood for X. Recall that we have Int N = N \ ∂ 0 N . Consider W := M \Int N . This is a compact 4-manifold. Pick a collar neighbourhood ∂W × [0, 1] and set E := N ∪ ∂ 0 N × [0, 1 2 ). We have an obvious projection map q : E → X turning q into a bundle map where the fibre is given by the open (4 − k)-ball of radius 3 2 . We leave it to the reader to turn q : N → X into an internal linear bundle, to show that it is in fact extendable (at this point one has to use that in the definition of E we only used "half" of the collar neighbourhood ∂ 0 N × [0, 1]), and to equip N with a positive definite form g such that N = E(g).

We conclude the section with the proof of the uniqueness theorem for tubular neighbourhoods.

Proof of Theorem 6.9. Let M be a 4-manifold and let X be a compact proper k-dimensional submanifold. Furthermore let p i : N i → X, i = 1, 2 be two tubular neighbourhoods of X. For i = 1, 2, let q i : E i → X be two corresponding normal vector bundles and let g i be the positive definite forms provided by Lemma 6.23. It follows from Theorem 6.20 that there exists a bundle isomorphism f : E 1 ∼ = − → E 2 such that ι 2 • f and ι 1 are ambiently isotopic rel X. It follows from the definitions that N 2 is equivalent to the disc bundle defined by f * g 2 on E 1 . But Lemma 6.22 (3) implies that f * g 2 and g 1 define equivalent tubular neighbourhoods.


## Background on bundle structures

In this section we recall the bundle technologies we will need to use in later sections. First we recall the three standard types of fibre bundle with fibre R n : O, PL and TOP.

Definition 7.1. Let TOP(n) be the subgroup of homeomorphisms of R n that fix the origin, topologised using the compact open topology. A principal TOP(n)-bundle has an associated fibre bundle with fibre R n and a preferred 0-section. Call such a bundle a topological R nbundle. Let TOP be the colimit colim − −−−− → TOP(n) under the inclusions − × Id R : TOP(n) → TOP(n + 1). Write BTOP(n) and BTOP for the corresponding classifying spaces.

Let O(n) be the orthogonal homeomorphisms of R n that fix the origin. Similarly to the case of homeomorphisms, define BO(n), O, and BO.

The definition of the analogous spaces for PL is a little more involved, using semisimplicial groups. For a gentle introduction to simplicial sets, see [Fri12]. The canonical reference for classifying spaces constructed using simplicial groups is [May75].
Definition 7.2. A homeomorphism f : K → L between two simplicial complexes K and L is a PL-homeomorphism if there are subdivisions K of K and L of L such that f : K → L is a simplicial map.
For background on piecewise linear topology see [RS72]. The next definition comes from [RS68a]. Let ∆ k be the standard k-simplex.

Definition 7.3. Let PL(n) • be the semi-simplicial group defined as follows.

(i) The group PL(n) k assigned to the k-simplex is the group of PL homeomorphisms
f : R n × ∆ k → R n × ∆ k over ∆ k , such that f | R n ×{t} fixes the origin in R n for every t ∈ ∆ k . That is, with p : R n × ∆ k → ∆ k the projection, the diagram R n × ∆ k p $ $ f / / R n × ∆ k p z z ∆ k commutes. (ii)
The ith face map is given by restricting to the ith face of ∆ k . Now define BPL(n) by first using the level-wise bar construction to obtain a semi-simplicial space, and then geometrically realising to obtain a space BPL(n). Define PL and BPL as colimits analogously to Definition 7.1.

Remark 7.4. It is interesting that we do not define PL(n) using the subspace topology from TOP(n). Note that we also do not define Diff(n) = Diff(R n ) in this way. But for defining Diff(n) as a topological group, and using this topology to define BDiff(n), we have the bespoke Whitney topology. In the absence of an analogous topology for PL(n), we use the simplicial strategy. In fact this simplicial method could be used to define all three of TOP(n), PL(n) and Diff(n), giving a uniform treatment. But only in the PL case do we really know of no other method that works.

All smooth manifolds have tangent vector bundles and all smooth submanifolds have normal vector bundles. This is one reason that vector bundles, corresponding to the structure group O(n), are the de facto bundle technology in the smooth category. A general difficulty we will face when talking about manifold transversality in Section 10 is that we will need to use some well-defined notion of normal structure for a submanifold and, outside of the smooth category, submanifolds do not necessarily admit normal vector bundles. However, various weaker bundle technologies have been developed, which replace this crucial concept in the topological category.

The rest of this section is devoted to a discussion of microbundles [Mil64]. The existence and uniqueness of microbundles leads to the existence and uniqueness of tangent and (stable) normal R n -bundles for TOP(n), as discussed below. Source material on microbundles is not hard to find in the literature, but has been included here for the convenience of the reader, in order for this survey to be more self-contained.

The interaction between the weaker fibre automorphism groups PL(n) and TOP(n) for tangent and (stable) normal R n -bundles, and the topological/piecewise linear/smooth structures on the manifold itself are the topic of smoothing theory, to which we turn in Section 8.

Definition 7.5. An n-dimensional microbundle ξ consists of a base space B and a total space E sitting in a diagram 
B i − → E r − → B, such that r •i = Id B ,phism φ b : V → U × R n such that V r & & φ b U i 8 8 ×{0} % % U U × R n pr 1 9 9
commutes.

Note that we only require a neighbourhood of i(b) to be trivial, and not all of the fibre r −1 (b). In fact, we only care about neighbourhoods i(B) ⊂ E, and declare two microbundles B → E → B and B → E → B to be equivalent, if i(B) and i (B) have homeomorphic neighbourhoods such that the homeomorphism commutes with both the inclusion map and the restriction of the retraction map.

Definition 7.6. Let r : E → B be a microbundle ξ and let f :
A → B be a map. The pullback of ξ under f is the microbundle f * ξ with total space f * E = (a, e) ∈ A × E | f (a) = r(e) ,
retraction (f * r)(a, e) = a, and section (f * s)(a) = a, s(f (a)) . In the case that f is an inclusion, also consider the microbundle ξ| A , which has total space r −1 (A) ⊂ E, and retraction r A : r −1 (A) → A and section s A : A → r −1 (A) are both the restrictions of r, s. In this case, the map of total spaces (a, e) → e gives a preferred isomorphism f * ξ to ξ| A .

A topological R n -bundle clearly has an underlying microbundle. Kister 
i − → E r − → B be an n-dimensional microbundle ξ. Then there exists an open set F ⊂ E containing i(B) such that r : F → B
is the projection map of a topological R n -bundle, whose 0-section is i and whose underlying microbundle is ξ. Moreover, if F 1 and F 2 are any two topological R n -bundles over B such that the underlying microbundles are isomorphic, then F 1 and F 2 are isomorphic as topological R n -bundles.

Every manifold admits a tangent microbundle. More subtle is the concept of a normal microbundle.
Definition 7.9 (Normal microbundle). A normal microbundle of a submanifold S of a manifold M is a microbundle S → E → S such that E is a neighbourhood of S in M .
It is immediate from the definition of normal microbundle that the local flatness in the definition of a submanifold S is a necessary condition for the existence of a normal microbundle. Wild submanifolds that are not submanifolds do not admit normal microbundles. Indeed, it is generally far from straightforward to prove the existence of normal microbundles at all. Here is an existence and uniqueness result due to Stern [Ste75, Theorem'4.5]. See also [Hir66], [Hir68,p. 65], and [KS77, Essay IV, Appendix A].

Theorem 7.10. Let M n+q be a manifold, and let N n ⊂ M n+q be a proper submanifold of codimension q. Suppose that n ≤ q + 1 + j and q ≥ 5 + j for some j = 0, 1, 2. Then N admits a normal microbundle restricting to a normal microbundle of ∂N ⊂ ∂M .

If in addition n ≤ q + j, then this normal microbundle is unique up to isotopy.

Remark 7.11 (Unique up to isotopy). For a submanifold N ⊂ M we say a normal microbundle ν(N ) is unique up to isotopy if whenever there is another normal microbundle ν (N ), there exists a microbundle equivalence f between ν(N ) and ν (N ) such that π • f is isotopic to π relative to N .

We exploit these theorems to define a stable normal structure on any manifold, that will play an important role in Section 8. Consider that any closed n-manifold M can be embedded as a submanifold M ⊂ R m for large m [Hat02, Corollary A.9]. For large enough m, any two such embeddings are isotopic. For large enough m, Theorem 7.10 implies there is a normal microbundle ξ. After possibly increasing m further, the last sentence of Theorem 7.10 implies this normal microbundle ξ is unique. By the Kister-Mazur Theorem this defines a unique topological R m−n -bundle. We remove the dependence on m by passing to the stable bundle TOP(m − n) ⊂ TOP. Thus the process described gives a well-defined classifying map ν M : M → BTOP. Summarising, we have the following.

Definition 7.12. Given any closed n-manifold, the topological R ∞ -bundle ν M : M → BTOP, described above, is called the stable topological normal bundle. It is well-defined and unique.

The next example shows that outside the hypotheses of Theorem 7.10, we should expect that normal microbundles can be very badly behaved.

Example 7.13. Normal microbundles do not necessarily exist. Rourke and Sanderson [RS67, Example 2] construct S 19 as a submanifold of a certain 28-dimensional PL manifold M in such a way that it does not admit a topological normal microbundle. The embedding is even piecewise linear.

Even when topological normal microbundles exist, they are not always unique: Rourke and Sanderson consider the smooth standard embedding S 18 ⊂ S 27 [RS68b, Theorem 3.12] and construct a certain normal microbundle ξ of S 18 ⊂ S 27 . The construction of ξ is such that if ξ were concordant to the trivial normal microbundle, this concordance would induce a normal microbundle structure back on the embedding S 19 ⊂ M 28 of the previous example. As this is not possible, ξ is non-trivial. Note that the smooth normal bundle νS 18 of the standard embedding is trivial, so S 18 ⊂ S 27 admits at least two different normal microbundles.

The following theorem ensures the issues of the previous example are not seen in dimension 4.

Theorem 7.14. Let X be a codimension n proper submanifold of a 4-manifold M . Then X admits a normal microbundle. Moreover, if ξ is a normal microbundle of X, it is the underlying microbundle to a normal vector bundle.

Proof. The existence of normal microbundles in ambient dimension 4 is an immediate consequence of the existence of normal vector bundles (Theorem 6.17).

Given a normal microbundle ξ, we apply the Kister-Mazur theorem 7.7 to obtain an embedded R n -bundle with underlying microbundle ξ. For n ≤ 2, the homotopy fibre TOP(n)/ O(n) for the forgetful map BO(n) → BTOP(n) is contractible, and for k ≤ 4 we have π k (TOP(3)/ O(3)) = 0 [KS77, Essay V, Theorems 5.8 and 5.9]. Using these facts, and checking the obstructions in each of the cases n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, we see in each case the embedded topological R n -bundle can be upgraded to an embedded vector bundle. Choose such a vector bundle refinement. By restricting to an open disc bundle and rescaling we can ensure this internal linear bundle is extendable and thus a normal vector bundle in the sense of Definition 6.15.

We will make use of our discussion of normal microbundles in Section 10 on topological transversality.


## Smoothing 4-manifolds

We present three theorems which associate a smooth manifold to a given 4-manifold. Often these theorems can be used to reduce proofs about 4-manifolds to the case of smooth 4-manifolds, where the standard tools of differential topology are available. Theorem 8.1. Every connected, noncompact 4-manifold is smoothable. Thus every 4manifold M has a smooth structure in the complement of any closed set that has at least one point in each compact component of M .

There are some related statements in the literature on smoothing 4-manifolds in the complement of a point, that appeared prior to Freedman's work [Fre82] and prior to [Qui82]. We discuss them briefly here. For the case of PL structures on noncompact 4-manifolds, given a lift of the (unstable) tangent microbundle classifying map M → BTOP(4) to the PL category M → BPL(4) (see Section 7), the proof can be found in [Las70,p. 54] and [KS77, Essay V, Addendum 1.4.1]. This result was stated for smooth bundle structures and smooth structures on manifolds in [Las71]. Alternatively, [HM74], [FQ90,Theorem 8.3B] apply to improve a PL structure to a smooth structure, unique up to isotopy, for any manifold of dimension at most six. Again, in [Las71] Lashof assumes a lift of the (unstable) tangent microbundle classifying map M → BTOP(4) to a map M → BO(4). For noncompact connected 4-manifolds, such a lift always exists, as was later shown by Quinn [Qui82,Qui84], [FQ90,p. 116] using the full disc embedding theorem [Fre82], and giving rise to Theorem 8.1.

Due to the seminal nature of Freedman's Field's medal winning paper [Fre82], it is well worth clarifying the details of some citations therein. In the proof of Corollary 1.2, in the proof of Theorem 1.5 on page 369, in the proof of Theorem 1.6, and at the start of Section 10, Freedman uses that smoothing theory is available for noncompact 4-manifolds. In particular, smoothing for noncompact contractible 4-manifolds plays a vital rôle in Freedman's proof of the topological 4-dimensional Poincaré conjecture [Fre82, Theorem 1.6]. Freedman cites [KS77] for this fact, however [KS77, Essay V, Remarks 1.6 (A)] specifically excludes smooth structures (but for a stronger result). Nevertheless, as mentioned above, Lashof 
)/ O(4) → TOP / O K(Z/2, 3) is 5-connected [FQ90, Theorem 8.7A],
where only 3-connected is needed for Theorem 8.1. In other words, it was shown prior to Freedman's work that homotopy 4-spheres admit a smooth structure in the complement of a point, so the results that Freedman required were indeed known. However, smoothing in the complement of a point was not known for general connected 4-manifolds until after the work of Quinn in 1982. Further discussion can also be found in Quinn [Qui84] and Lashof-Taylor [LT84].

Below we will give applications of Theorem 8.1, see e.g. the proof of Theorem 10.9. Here, we used again that 4-manifolds have the homotopy type of a CW-complex. We refer to the corresponding element of Z/2 as the Kirby-Siebenmann ks(M ) invariant of the compact, connected manifold M . For disconnected compact 4-manifolds,
M = n i=1 M i , define ks(M ) = n i=1 ks(M i ) ∈ Z/2.
In the following theorem we summarise some key properties of the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant.

Theorem 8.2. Let M and N be compact 4-manifolds.

(1) If M × R admits a smooth structure (e.g. if M admits a smooth structure), then ks(M ) = 0.

(2) The Kirby-Siebenmann invariant is additive under the connected sum operation. We could not find explicit proofs of these facts in the literature, so we give some details. 
Proof. Let us prove (1). The tangent bundle of M × R is isomorphic to τ M ⊕ ε, where τ M isτ M ⊕ ε = p • τ Diff M ×R .
Passing to the stable classifying spaces, we obtain a lift M → BO whose composition with the canonical map BO → BTOP agrees with τ M ⊕ ε ∞ , the stable tangent microbundle of M . Since the map BO → BTOP factors through BPL → BTOP, we have a stable lift of τ M and so ks(M ) = 0. This completes the proof of (1).

Next, (2) is a consequence of (5). However since (5) follows from (3), we also remark that (2) follows from (3)  This completes the proof of (3). Now (4) follows easily. First note that the addition on Ω TOP 4 is by disjoint union, so ks is additive by definition. The map ks : Ω TOP 4 → Z/2 is well-defined by (3). Therefore ks : Ω TOP 4 → Z/2 is a homomorphism as desired.

To prove (5), it was suggested by Jim Davis to consider the exact sequence
Ω O 4 → Ω TOP 4 → Ω {O→TOP} 4 → Ω O 3 = 0.
Here Ω 
∂W = M ∪ ∂M ∂ vert W ∪ ∂N N, for some smooth 4-dimensional cobordism ∂ vert W with boundary ∂M ∂N .
By the exact sequence, Ω and is therefore isomorphic to Z/2 via the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant. We therefore need to show that the disjoint union M N is bordant to M ∪ S=T N , where S ⊂ ∂M and T ⊂ ∂N are compact codimension zero submanifolds with S ∼ = T . Here is a construction of such a bordism. For
I = [0, 1], take (M × I) (S × I × [1/2, 1]) (N × I), identify S × {0} × [1/2, 1] ∼ S × [1/2, 1] ⊆ (M × [1/2, 1]),
and, using the identification S ∼ = T , identify
S × {1} × [1/2, 1] ∼ T × [1/2, 1] ⊆ N × [1/2, 1].
Let W be the result of this gluing and some rounding of corners. The boundary of W is
(M N ) ∪ ∂M ∂N ∂ vert W ∪ ∂(M ∪ S=T N ) M ∪ S=T N, where ∂ vert W = (∂M × [0, 1/2]) ∪ (∂M \ S × [1/2, 1]) ∪(S × I × {1/2}) ∪ (∂S × I × [1/2, 1]) (∂N × [0, 1/2]) ∪ (∂N \ T × [1/2, 1]).
This shows that M N and M ∪ S=T N are equal in Ω , and therefore have the same Kirby-Siebenmann invariants. Since ks(M N ) = ks(M ) + ks(N ), this completes the proof of (5).

To prove (6), we consider the following diagram. The maps between bordism groups are structure forgetting maps, so the diagram commutes. Both sequences are exact: a smooth manifold has vanishing ks invariant, and vanishing ks(M ) implies smoothable after adding copies of S 2 × S 2 by Theorem 8.6 below. Since M #S 2 × S 2 is (spin) bordant to M , the sequences are exact at their middle terms. Finally, a topological null bordism of a compact smooth 4-manifold can be smoothed by high dimensional smoothing theory, so the left hand maps are injective.

We claim that the sequence in the upper row does not split. Consider the K3 surface generating Ω Spin On the other hand the E 8 -manifold, whose existence was established by Freedman [Fre82, Theorem 1.7] as a key step in the proof of the classification theorem 11.2, represents a class in Ω TOPSpin 4 and maps to (8, 1) ∈ Z ⊕ Z/2 ∼ = Ω STOP 4 . We note for later that the E 8 manifold has ks(E 8 ) = 1: E 8 cannot be smoothed, even after adding copies of S 2 × S 2 , by Rochlin's theorem (Theorem 3.4) that every closed spin smooth 4-manifold has signature divisible by 16, whereas if ks(E 8 ) = 0, then E 8 would be stably smoothable by Theorem 8.6.

It follows that 2 · [E 8 ] maps to 0 ∈ Z/2 so has trivial ks invariant, and therefore by exactness of the top row lies in the image of Ω Spin 4 . Let N be a closed spin smooth 4-manifold
TOPSpin-bordant to E 8 #E 8 . Since σ(E 8 #E 8 ) = 16 = σ(K3), we have [N ] = [K3] ∈ Ω Spin 4 .
It follows that K3, the generator of Ω Spin
4 ∼ = Z, maps to 2 · [E 8 ] ∈ Ω TOPSpin 4
. Thus we have a diagram with exact rows:
0 / / Z ·2 / / = Z / / 1 →[E 8 ] Z/2 / / = 0 0 / / Z 1 →2·[E 8 ] / / Ω TOPSpin 4 / / Z/2 / / 0
Since ks(E 8 ) = 1, the diagram commutes. Then by the five lemma, Ω TOPSpin 4 ∼ = Z, generated by E 8 , and the sequence does not split, as claimed. The diagram
Ω TOPSpin 4 ∼ = σ/8 / / Z 1 →(8,1) $ $ Ω STOP 4 ∼ = / / Z ⊕ Z/2 ks / / Z/2,
which commutes by computing on the generator E 8 of Ω TOPSpin
4 ∼ = Z, shows that ks(M ) = σ(M )/8 ∈ Z/2 for TOPSpin manifolds M .
This completes the proof of (6) and therefore of Theorem 8.2.

The following theorem says that the converse to Theorem 8.2 (1) holds. on the trefoil has σ/8 odd. Therefore the contractible 4-manifold (with signature zero) has Kirby-Siebenman invariant 1. So by Theorem 8.2 (5), we have ks( * CP 2 ) = 1. The Chern manifold * CP 2 is homotopy equivalent to CP 2 but is not homeomorphic. For further discussion of the star construction, see [FQ90,Section 10.4] and [Tei97].

The following theorem says in particular that given any compact 4-manifold M there exists a closed orientable simply-connected 4-manifold N such M #N is smoothable.

Theorem 8.6. Let M be compact 4-manifold. There exists a closed, orientable, simply connected 4-manifold N such M #N admits a smooth structure. If moreover the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant of M is zero, then there exists a k ∈ N 0 such that M # k S 2 × S 2 admits a smooth structure.

Proof. Let M be compact 4-manifold. Perform the connected sum with an appropriate number of copies of * CP 2 , the closed oriented simply-connected 4-manifold with nontrivial Kirby-Siebenmann invariant, homotopy equivalent to CP 2 , constructed on [FQ90,p. 167], in order to obtain a manifold with every connected component having zero Kirby-Siebenmann invariant. It follows from the discussion on [FQ90,p. 164] and the Sum-stable smoothing theorem [FQ90,p. 125], that performing the connected sum with enough copies of S 2 × S 2 produces a manifold that admits a smooth structure.

Remark 8.7. Given a lift of the classifying map of the (unstable) tangent microbundle of M to BO(4), Lashof-Shaneson [LS71] showed that there exists a k ∈ N 0 such that M # k S 2 ×S 2 admits a smooth structure. The result quoted in the previous proof extended this to a lift of the corresponding stable maps.


## Tubing of surfaces

As an example of the use of the technology we have discussed thus far, we show that one can tube together two locally flat embedded surfaces in a 4-manifold, to obtain an embedding of the connected sum. This operation is standard in the smooth category, but as ever in the topological category one should take some care.

The following situation is by no means the most general such result possible. We wish to illustrate two things. First, that operations on surfaces that can be performed in the smooth category can usually also be performed in general 4-manifolds with locally flat surfaces (although performing these operations in a parametrised way seems to be beyond current knowledge). Second, we want to show the level of detail required to demonstrate that such operations work. (iii) The arc C extends to a neighbourhood C × D 2 embedded in M such that E S := {P } × D 2 ⊆ S and E T :
= {Q} × D 2 ⊆ T . (iv) We have (C × D 2 ) \ (E S ∪ E T ) ⊆ M \ (S ∪ T ). (v)
The intersection of C × D 2 with a normal disc bundle D(S) of S is such that for every d, (C × {d}) ∩ D(S) is a ray in a single fibre of D(S), and similarly for T . Moreover there is a trivialisation of the normal bundle over E S as E S × D 2 such that for every
c ∈ C with ({c} × D 2 ) ∩ D(S) = ∅, we have that {c} × D 2 = E S × {e}
for some e ∈ D 2 , and all such e that arise this way lie on a fixed ray from the origin of D 2 .

These data allow us to perform tubing of surfaces ambiently.

Proposition 9.2. Given data S, T , C × D 2 , E S and E T as in Proposition 9.1, the subset
(S \ 1 2 E S ) ∪ (T \ 1 2 E T ) ∪ C × 1 2 S 1
is a 2-dimensional submanifold abstractly homeomorphic to S#T .

Proof. The surfaces and the tube are locally flat by assumption, or by construction from Proposition 9.1. The circles where the tube is glued to the surface are locally flat points.

To see this observe that we have arranged a coordinate system in which this gluing is a completely standard attachment at angle π/2. 
∂ S X ∪ ∂ T X = ∂X \ ∂M .
Choose a trivialisation of the normal bundle νS in a neighbourhood N (E S ) of E S , as N (E S ) × D 2 . A ray in D 2 from the origin to the boundary determines an embedding E S ×[0, 1] ⊂ 1 2 D(S). We obtain in particular a disc E S ×{1} ∈ N (E S )×{pt} ⊂ N (E S )×S 1 . Choose a smooth structure on ∂X (which we may do since ∂X is a 3-manifold), and choose a smoothly embedded neighbourhood F S ∼ = D 3 in ∂ S X that contains E S ×{1} in its interior.

Make the analogous set of choices and constructions for T , to obtain
E T , N (E T ), E T × [0, 1] ⊂ 1 2 D(T ), and F T ∼ = D 3 in ∂ T X that contains E T × {1} in its interior.
Remove a point r from X, and using Theorem 8.1 choose a smooth structure on X \ {r} extending the chosen smooth structure on ∂X. Choose a smoothly embedded path C X ⊂ X between the centres of E S × {1} and E T × {1}, such that C X extends along the previously chosen rays inside the normal bundles to a path C between P and Q such that [C] = [γ] ∈ H 1 (M, {P, Q}; Z). Extend C X to a codimension zero submanifold N (C X ) homeomorphic to I × D 3 , with I × {0} ⊂ I × D 3 mapping to C X , and such that {0} × D 3 maps to F S ⊆ ∂ S X and {1} × D 3 maps to F T ⊂ ∂ T X.  We now obtain a codimension zero submanifold C X × D 3 homeomorphic to I × D 3 such that, with respect to the collar neighbourhood Ψ 2 , we have:
∂ T X ∂ S X X = M \ (Int 1 2 D(S) ∪ Int 1 2 D(T )) T C X N (C X ) ∼ = D 3 ×I disc bundle D(T ) disc bundle D(S) r E S S P E S ×{1} Q E T E S ×{1}• For all c ∈ C X such that {c} × D 3 ∩ Ψ 2 (∂X × [0, 1]) = ∅, we have that {c} × D 3 ⊂ Ψ 2 (∂X × {t}) for some t ∈ [0, 1]. • For every d ∈ D 3 , (C × {d}) ∩ (∂X × [0, 1]) = Ψ 2 ({x} × [0, 1])
for some x in either F S or F T . In addition, above we constructed two discs E S ⊂ F S and E T ⊂ F T . Any two embedded discs in a 3-ball are ambiently isotopic: place this isotopy inside C X ×D 3 to obtain a locally flat embedding C X × D 2 ∼ = I × D 2 ⊂ C X × D 3 . Now consider X ⊂ M and take the union
(E S × [0, 1]) ∪ (C X × D 2 ) ∪ (E T × [0, 1]) ⊆ M
to obtain an embedding C × D 2 ∼ = I × D 2 whose intersection with S equals E S and whose intersection with T equals E T . The core C = C × {0} is of course a locally flat embedded path in M from P to Q with interior in M \ (S ∪ T ) and with the correct relative homology class in H 1 (M, {P, Q}; Z). We may then perform the tubing S#T :
= (S \ E S ) ∪ (T \ E T ) ∪ C × S 1 as promised.

## Topological transversality

We turn to the subject of transversality in the topological category. Some discussion of this concept is in order. There are two important contexts for transversality: submanifold transversality and map transversality. In this article, map transversality will be deduced from submanifold transversality. Submanifold transversality when none of the manifolds involved has dimension 4 is due to to Marin [Mar77]; cf. [KS77, Essay III, Section 1]. Transversality in the remaining cases is due to Quinn [Qui82,Qui88]; see also [FQ90,Section 9.5].

A naive definition of submanifold transversality in the topological category is that manifolds are locally transverse if around any intersection point there is a chart in which the submanifolds appear as perpendicular planes. On the other hand, there are examples (in the relative setting) of submanifolds which cannot be made locally transverse via ambient isotopy; see Remark 10.4. Thus one cannot generally use this definition.

In light of this, in order to make general statements, one passes to some notion of global transversality. Global transversality means that transversality statements are made with respect to a given choice of normal structure on one of the submanifolds involved. Of course, this forces one to engage with the question of existence and uniqueness of whatever normal structure is used, and the 'correct' choice of normal structure is still not fully settled in the topological category. We refer the reader to [FQ90, Sections 9.4, 9.6C] for a brief discussion of the competitors.

The most general statement of transversality [Qui88, Theorem] uses microbundles to describe normal structure, and this is the technology we will use. As discussed in Section 7, for general manifolds, tangent microbundles always exist but normal microbundles do not (see Example 7.13). The case of dimension 4 is special, since here the normal vector bundles of Section 6.3, which are a stronger notion than normal microbundles, always exist. In fact, the results obtained for these normal vector bundles in dimension 4 are a strong enough to ensure that submanifold transversality holds in ambient dimension 4 with the νX Y Figure 9. Sketch of a transverse intersection of Y to νX.

naive, local transversality definition discussed above. The reader may therefore wonder why we even introduce normal microbundles into a discussion of 4-manifold transversality. The answer is that the 'submanifold transversality implies map transversality' argument of Section 10.2 requires a bundle technology that works in all dimensions, and microbundles appear to be the most convenient. 
E(νX) of X such that Y ∩ U = r −1 X (X ∩ Y ) ∩ U .
Lemma 10.2. Let X, Y submanifolds of M . Let Y be transverse to a normal microbundle νX. Then X ∩ Y is a submanifold of Y with normal microbundle (νX)| X∩Y .

Proof. Once we have established that (νX)| X∩Y is a normal microbundle of X ∩ Y in Y , the subspace X ∩ Y will automatically be a submanifold since the trivialisation of the microbundle (νX)| X∩Y gives the required charts for X ∩ Y .

At least after shrinking the total space of E(νX), each fibre r −1 (x) for x ∈ X ∩ Y will be contained in Y by the definition of transversality. That is E((νX)| X∩Y ) is a subset of Y and neighbourhood of X ∩ Y . This shows that (νX)| X∩Y is a normal microbundle of
X ∩ Y ⊂ Y .
Transversality in high dimensions is due to to Marin [Mar77], cf. [KS77, Essay III, Section 1]. The formulation below is from Quinn [Qui88]. Recall Definition 6.1 of a proper submanifold. Note that in the next theorem there is no restriction on dimensions. The manifold M is allowed to be noncompact and have nonempty boundary.

Theorem 10.3 (Transversality for submanifolds). Let X and Y be proper submanifolds of a compact manifold M . Let νY be a normal microbundle for Y . Let C be a closed subset such that X is transverse to νY in a neighbourhood of C. Let U be a neighbourhood of the set M \ C ∩ X ∩ Y . Then there exists an isotopy of X supported in U to a proper submanifold X such that X is transverse to νY .

Proof. See Quinn [Qui88] for all cases but dim M = 4, dim X = 2 and dim Y = 2. For the remaining case, first establish local transversality using [FQ90, Section 9.5]. Note that X ∩ Y is a discrete collection of points. Therefore, the coordinate chart, witnessing local transversality, defines a normal neighbourhood of Y near X ∩Y . This normal vector bundle can be extended to a normal vector bundle νY on all of Y by [FQ90, Theorem 9.3A]. The submanifold X is now transverse to νY , but (possibly) not to νY . By Theorem 7.14, our microbundle νY comes from a normal vector bundle. By uniqueness of normal vector bundles (Theorem 6.20), there is an isotopy from νY to νY . Apply this isotopy to X. Now X is transverse to νY .

Remark 10.4. The analogous statement to Theorem 10.3 is false for local transversality. Examples of this failure even exist in the PL category: Hudson [Hud69] constructs, for certain large n, closed PL submanifolds X, Y ⊂ R n , that are topologically unknotted Euclidean spaces of codimension ≥ 3, in such a way that X and Y are PL locally transverse near a closed neighbourhood K of infinity but also so that it is impossible to move X and Y by isotopy relative to K to make them PL locally transverse everywhere.

Although transversality for submanifolds (Theorem 10.3) is only stated for a pair of submanifolds, it can be used to make collections of submanifolds transverse.

Lemma 10.5. Let M be an 2m-dimensional manifold for m ≥ 1, and let X 1 , . . . , X n be m-dimensional compact submanifolds with normal microbundles νX i . Then the submanifolds X i can be isotoped such that there are no triple intersection points and the submanifolds intersect (pairwise) transversely.

Proof. We give a proof by induction. When n = 1, there is nothing to show, since every submanifold is embedded. For the inductive step, denote X n by Y . The inductive hypothesis states that we can isotope any n − 1 submanifolds X 1 , . . . , X n−1 so that there are no triple points and that they intersect pairwise transversely. We will prove that the submanifolds X 1 , . . . , X n−1 can be further isotoped so that they are transverse to νY and Y is free of triple points. Note that having no triple points on Y implies that there exists an open set U Y such that:
X i ∩ X j ⊂ U Y for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 1, and M \ U Y is a neighbourhood of Y .
To obtain the lemma apply the inductive hypothesis, picking all further isotopies to be supported in U Y .

We proceed by showing the inductive step: we can isotope every X i to be transverse to νY such that no triple points lie on Y . For each i = 1, . . . , n − 1, apply Theorem 10.3 to arrange that Y and X i intersect transversely. By compactness of the submanifolds, the subset T Y = Y ∩ (X 1 ∪ · · · ∪ X n−1 ) is compact. Pick disjoint open neighbourhoods V y ⊂ Y around each point y ∈ T Y . Pick a chart φ of Y around φ(0) = y contained in V y , and a microbundle chart around y ∈ Y . In Figure 10. Displacing a triple point y in a microbundle chart.
X i and X j X i X j Y y u i u j
the local model, Y corresponds to R m ×{0} and the X i that intersect Y in y will be mapped to 0 × R m . For those X i , pick disjoint points u i ∈ R m (here we use m > 0), and pick a continuous function η :
R ≥0 → [0, 1] with η(t) = 1 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and η(t) = 0 for t ≥ 2. Replace X i in the chart with the image of R m → R m × R m v → η v u i , v .
Call this new submanifold X i . It agrees with X i outside the ball of radius 2, and is isotopic to X i . In V y , the submanifold X i intersects Y only in φ(u i ) and there it intersects Y transversely with respect to νY . The collection {X i } has no triple intersection points in the set V y anymore.

Here is another result on submanifold transversality. It might often happen that one can find a continuous map of, for example, a disc D 2 into a 4-manifold M , perhaps if fundamental group computations yield a null homotopy of a circle. Then this disc can be perturbed to locally flat immersion. If M were smooth, this would be a consequence of standard differential topology, an observation that we leverage.

Theorem 10.6. Let Σ be a connected 1 or 2 dimensional manifold and let f : Σ → X be a continuous map of Σ into a connected 4-manifold X. Let C be a closed subset of Σ such that f | C is a locally flat immersion. Then there is a perturbation of f to a locally flat immersion f : Σ → X with f | C = f | C .

Proof. Perturb f to a map that misses a point. Then smooth X in the complement of that point and C using Theorem 8.   Figure 11. Transversality for maps from transversality for submanifolds.

We are not sure how to give a purely topological proof of this.


### Transversality for maps.

Definition 10.7. Let f : M → N be a continuous map and let X be a submanifold of N with normal microbundle νX. The map f is said to be transverse to νX if f −1 (X) is a submanifold admitting a normal microbundle νf −1 (X) and
f : νf −1 (X) → f * νX m → (r(m), f (m))
is an isomorphism of microbundles.

In the next theorem, we show how to reduce transversality for maps to transversality for submanifolds. Again, there are restrictions neither on dimensions nor codimensions. 
F : M × I → graph f × I G − → M × N pr N − − → N.
Since the isotopy G is supported in U , statement (3) holds. By construction, F (x, 0) = pr Y (x, f (x)) = f (x), which proves statement (1). Now we prove statement (2). Let F 1 : M → N be the map that sends x → F (x, 1). We keep track of the preimages through the maps of the composition that defines F 1 ; see Figure 11. By transversality of T to M × νY , we see that Z = T ∩ (M × Y ) = pr −1 (Y ) is a submanifold of T with normal bundle M × νY | Z , and that the projection to N induces a microbundle isomorphism M × νY | Z ∼ − → pr * N νY . By definition, pr N : T → N is transverse to νY .

We transport the submanifold Z back to M . Consider the commutative diagram
N M graph f × {1} T ∼ = F 1 q ∼ = pr N ,
where q is the composition, which is a homeomorphism. Now F −1 1 (Y ) = q −1 (Z) is a submanifold with normal microbundle
q * M × νY | Z = q * pr * N νY = F * 1 νY, that is F 1 : M → N is transverse to νY .
10.3. Representing homology classes by submanifolds. Our goal in this section is to prove the following theorem.

Theorem 10.9. Let X be a compact orientable 4-manifold and let A be a union of components of ∂X. Let k = 2 or k = 3 and let σ ∈ H k (X, A; Z).

(1) The class σ can be represented by a k-dimensional submanifold Y with ∂Y ⊂ A.

(2) In the case k = 3, the boundary of Y can be specified: if B ⊂ A is an oriented closed 2-dimensional smooth submanifold contained in A such that ∂(σ) = [B] ∈ H 2 (A), then σ can be represented by an oriented compact 3-dimensional submanifold Y with ∂Y = B.

The submanifold B can be assumed to be smooth, since ∂X is a 3-manifold and so has a unique smooth structure by [Moi52], [Moi77,.

Note that Theorem 10.9 also holds for k = 0 and k = 1. This is trivial for k = 0. To see this for k = 1, remove a point from each connected component to get a smooth 4-manifold by Theorem 8.1. Note that H 1 (X \ {pt}, A; Z) ∼ = H 1 (X, A; Z). Then by smooth approximation and general position, every 1-dimensional homology class can be represented by a 1-dimensional submanifold of X.

Example 10.10.

(1) If we apply the theorem to A = ∂X, we see that any homology class in H 2 (X, ∂X; Z) and H 3 (X, ∂X; Z) can be represented by a properly embedded submanifold. For A = ∅ we obtain the analogous statement for absolute homology groups. We will provide two proofs for Theorem 10.9. The first one use Theorem 8.1 to reduce the statement to the smooth case, and the second one uses the topological transversality arguments from Section 10.

For n = 4 the statement of the following theorem is precisely the statement of Theorem 10.9 in the smooth category.

Proposition 10.11. Let X be a compact orientable smooth n-manifold and let A be a union of components of ∂X. Let = 1 or = 2 and let σ ∈ H n− (X, A; Z). Then the following holds.

(1) The class σ is represented by an (n − )-dimensional smooth orientable submanifold Y with ∂Y ⊂ A.

(2) Suppose = 1 and suppose we are given a oriented closed (n − 2)-dimensional smooth submanifold of A such that ∂(σ) = [B] ∈ H n−2 (A), then σ is represented by an oriented compact (n − 1)-dimensional smooth submanifold Y with ∂Y = B.

Example 10.12. Let K ⊂ S 3 be a knot. We write X = S 3 \ νK. Let λ ⊂ ∂X be a longitude of K. There exists a homology class σ ∈ H 2 (X, ∂X; Z) with ∂(σ) = [λ]. It follows from Proposition 10.11 that there exists an orientable surface F in X with ∂F = K.

Proof. Let X be a compact orientable smooth n-manifold and let A be a union of components of ∂X. First we deal with the case = 1. Let σ ∈ H n−1 (X, A; Z). Write A = ∂X \ A. Let PD : H 1 (X, A; Z) → H n−1 (X, A; Z) be the Poincaré duality isomorphism. We have H 1 (X, A; Z) ∼ = [X/ A, S 1 ] and any such class can be represented by a continuous map ϕ : X → S 1 that is constant on A, and uniquely determined up to homotopy rel. A. We can and shall homotope ϕ to a smooth map. Furthermore, arrange that −1 ∈ S 1 is a regular value of ϕ. Then ϕ −1 (−1) is an (n − 1)-dimensional submanifold whose boundary lies on ∂X \ A, that is the boundary lies on A. This manifold has the desired property. Now suppose that we are given an oriented closed (n − 2)-dimensional submanifold B of A such that ∂(σ) = [B] ∈ H n−1 (A). Pick a collar neighbourhood ∂X × [0, 1] and choose a continuous map ϕ : X \ ∂X × [0, 1) → S 1 as above. Also choose a tubular neighbourhood B × [−1/2, 1/2] of B in A. Consider the map sending (b, t) to e πi(t−1) , b ∈ B, t ∈ [−1/2, 1/2] and extend it to a smooth map ψ : A → S 1 by sending all other points into {e πit ∈ S 1 : t ∈ [−2/3, 2/3]}. Since ∂(σ) = [B] ∈ H n−2 (A) ∼ = H 1 (A; Z), we see that the restriction of ϕ to A × {1} = A is homotopic to ψ : A → S 1 . Therefore, using this homotopy in the interval [ 1 2 , 1], we can extend ϕ to a function on X that restricts to ψ on each A×{s} with s ∈ [0, 1 2 ]. Finally, smoothen ϕ without changing it on A×[0, 1 4 ] to obtain a smooth map X → S 1 in the same homotopy class. This is possible since the original ϕ was already smooth on A × [0, 1 2 ]. Put differently, the new smooth map ϕ : X → S 1 restricts to ψ on A = A × {0}.

Note that −1 is a regular value of ψ, and by changing ϕ outside A × [0, 1 4 ], we can also arrange −1 to be a regular value of ϕ. The manifold Y = ϕ −1 (−1) satisfies [Y ] = σ (this follows from Lemma 10.17 below, as explained in the second proof of Theorem 10.9) and ∂Y = B × {0} = B.

For = 2 the argument is similar: we have to replace the argument using S 1 by the argument of [GS99, Proposition 1.2.3]. Recall from Theorem 4.5 that X is homotopy equivalent to finite CW complex. Therefore, we represent a codimension 2 homology class σ ∈ H n−2 (X, ∂X; Z) ∼ = H 2 (X; Z) by a map X → CP ∞ , and homotope into the k-skeleton to a map f : X → CP k for k ≥ 2. Now arrange f to be transverse to the codimension 2 submanifold CP k−1 ⊂ CP k . The desired submanifold is the preimage Y = f −1 (CP k−1 ). We leave further details to the reader.

Lemma 10.13. Let W be a smooth n-manifold and let C be a compact subset. There exists a compact smooth n-dimensional submanifold X of W that contains C.

Proof. By the Whitney embedding theorem (see e.g. [Lee11, Theorem 6.15]), there exists a proper embedding f : W → R 2n+1 . Recall that in this context proper means that the preimage of a compact set is compact. Pick a point P ∈ R 2n+1 that does not lie in the image of f . Denote the Euclidean distance to the point P by d : R 2n+1 → R ≥0 . This map is smooth outside P , so in particular d • f : W → R ≥0 is smooth. Since C is compact, there exists an r ∈ R ≥0 such that (d  Now we collect the tools to conduct the proof of Theorem 10.9 in the topological category. We use transversality for submanifolds as a black box, but we endeavour to provide all the other details.

Definition 10.14.
Let ξ = S i − → E π − → S be a k-dimensional microbundle over S. A Thom class of ξ is class τ (ξ) ∈ H k (E, E \i(S); Z) that restricts to generator H k (E x , E x \i(x); Z) ∼ = H k (R k ; R k \ {0}; Z) = Z for all x ∈ S.
The microbundle ξ together with a Thom class is an oriented microbundle.

Remark 10.15. As in the smooth case, consider the orientation bundle π : Or(ξ) → S with fibre over x ∈ S the discrete set
Or(ξ) x = primitive classes of H k (E x , E x \ i(x); Z) .
This is a Z/2-principal bundle, and a Thom class τ (ξ) determines a global section s ∈ Γ(Or(ξ)) by enforcing τ (ξ), s(x) = 1 for every x ∈ S. By the same equation, a global section Γ(Or(ξ)) determines a Thom class.

Remark 10.16. Let X be an oriented manifold. Let S be a submanifold with normal microbundle νS. An orientation of S determines a unique Thom class of νS compatible with the ambient orientation and vice versa.

To prove Theorem 10.9, we will consider a map f : X → Y that is transverse to a submanifold S. By the Remark 10.16, νS is an oriented microbundle and carrying the Thom class τ . Note as f : νf −1 (S) → f * νS is an isomorphic, also f * τ is a Thom class of νf −1 (S) and we orient f −1 (S) accordingly. Before we proceed with the proof, we recall the following compatibility between Thom classes and Poincaré duality [Bre97, Definition 11.1, Corollary 11.6], interpreted for microbundles.

Lemma 10.17. Let X be a compact oriented manifold with fundamental class [X], and let i : S → X be an oriented k-dimensional submanifold of X with normal microbundle νS. The composition Pick an x ∈ S and a k-disc U ⊆ S containing x such that the microbundle νS determines a trivialisation E(U ) = νS| U = U × D n−k . The fundamental class [X] restricts to a fundamental class [E(U )] ∈ H n (E(U ), ∂E(U )), and Poincaré duality can be computed locally:
H n−k νS, νS \ i(S) → H n−k (X, X \ S) → H n−k (X) PD X − −− → H k (X)H n−k (X, X \ S) H k (X) H k (νS) H n−k (E(U ), E(U ) \ S) H k (E(U ), (∂U ) × D n−k ) H k (U, ∂U ). res X[X] X[E(U )] φ ∼ =
We have to show that φ maps the Thom class τ U to the positive generator. For this, we claim the following compatibility of the Künneth isomorphism with Poincaré duality of products.

Claim. The diagram below commutes:
H n−k (U × D n−k , U × ∂D n−k ) H 0 (U ) ⊗ H n−k (D n−k , ∂D n−k ) H k (U × D n−k , ∂U × D n−k )) H k (U, ∂U ) ⊗ H 0 (D n−k ) PD E(Dx) PD U ⊗ PD D n−k .
We rewrite the diagram in terms of cap products and fundamental classes. Note that the fundamental class [U × D n−k ] = [U ] × [D n−k ] is a cross product. Using compatibility of the cross product with the cap product [Dol95, Section VII.12.17], we deduce that for arbitrary α ∈ H 0 (U ; Z), and β ∈ H n−k (D n−k , ∂D n−k ; Z) the equality
α × β X [U ] × [D n−k ] = (−1) (n−k)·|α| α X [U ] × β X [D n−k ]
holds, where α × β = pr * U α Y pr * D n−k β denotes the external cohomological product. The horizontal arrows in the diagram above are exactly given by the cross product in homology, and the commutativity is exactly the formula above. This shows the claim.

We deduce that PD E(U ) τ U = [U ]⊗pt since τ U = pt ⊗ϑ, where ϑ ∈ H n−k (D n−k , ∂D n−k ) is the generator that evaluates positively on the orientation class. This implies that φ(τ U ) = [U ] ∈ H k (U, ∂U ; Z) is the positive generator, as desired.

We give a proof of the main theorem above in the case of the codimension 1 and for a compact oriented manifold X, with A = ∂X.

Second proof of Theorem 10.9. Let α ∈ H 1 (X; Z) be the Poincaré dual to σ ∈ H 3 (X, ∂X). Recall the following correspondence between homotopy classes of maps to Eilenberg-Maclane spaces and cohomology classes of X,
[X, S 1 ] = [X, K(Z, 1)] ∼ = − → H 1 (X; Z) f → f * θ,
where θ is the Hom dual of the fundamental class of S 1 . Note that we used here that X is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Pick an arbitrary point pt ∈ S 1 and denote a tubular neighbourhood by ν(pt). Note that the Thom class τ pt for ν(pt) is mapped under H 1 (S 1 , S 1 \ pt) → H 1 (S 1 ) to θ. Let f : X → S 1 be a map corresponding to α, so f * θ = α. Make f transverse to a tubular neighbourhood of pt ∈ S 1 using Theorem 10.8. Consequently, S := f −1 (pt) is an (n − 1)-dimensional submanifold of X. By definition, f induces an isomorphism f : νS → f * ν(pt). We have, as elements in H 1 (X; Z), that
α = f * θ = f * PD −1 X [pt] = f * τ pt .
Since f * τ pt is the Thom class of νS, apply Lemma 10.17 and obtain
α = f * τ pt = τ S = PD −1 X [S].
Remark 10.18. We have seen that
f ! [pt] = PD X •f * • PD −1 S 1 [pt] = [f −1 (pt)
], when f is transverse to pt.


## Classification results for 4-manifolds

It is well-known (e.g. [CZ90, Theorem 5.1.1]) that any finitely presented group is the fundamental group of a closed orientable smooth 4-manifold. Markov [Mar58] used this fact to show that closed 4-manifolds cannot be classified up to homeomorphism. To circumvent this group theoretic issue one aims to classify 4-manifolds with a given isomorphism type of a fundamental group.

In this section we present the known 4-manifold classification results that have been obtained by the techniques of classical surgery theory in the topological category and using Freedman's disc embedding theorem [Fre82]. The use of this theorem requires the fundamental group of the 4-manifold be "good" [FQ90, Part II, Introduction], a condition that has a precise geometric description using the "π 1 -null disc property". We will not reproduce that description here, but will instead note which groups are currently known to be good. Freedman showed that the infinite cyclic group and finite groups are good [Fre82, (see also [FQ90, [FT95,KQ00] it was shown that groups with subexponential growth are good. 11.1. Simply connected 4-manifolds. The following theorem was the first noteworthy result towards a classification of 4-dimensional manifolds.

Theorem 11.1. Suppose M and N are two closed oriented simply-connected 4-dimensional manifolds. If the intersection forms are isometric, then M and N are homotopy equivalent.

Proof. This theorem was proved for smooth manifolds by Milnor [Mil58, Theorem 3], building on work of Whitehead [Whi49]. Furthermore [GS99, Theorem 1.2.25] sketches a proof that works for the general case.

We state Freedman's classification for closed, simply connected 4-manifolds [Fre82, Theorem 1.5]. Note that a special case is the 4-dimensional topological Poincaré conjecture that every homotopy 4-sphere is homeomorphic to S 4 . We give the statement as in [FQ90,Theorem 10.1]. The last sentence comes from [Qui86].

Theorem 11.2. Fix a triple (F, θ, k), where F is a finitely generated free abelian group, θ is a symmetric, nonsingular, bilinear form θ : F × F → Z, and k ∈ Z/2. If θ is even, that is θ(x, x) ∈ Z is even for every x ∈ F , then suppose that σ(θ)/8 ≡ k ∈ Z/2. In other words, every even, symmetric, integral matrix with determinant ±1 is realised as the intersection form of a unique closed, simply connected, oriented 4-manifold. For such matrices which are odd instead, there are precisely two closed, simply connected, oriented 4-manifolds up to homeomorphism, exactly one of which has vanishing Kirby-Siebenmann invariant and is therefore stably smoothable. These two manifolds are homotopy equivalent by Theorem 11.1.

In particular, the last paragraph with M = M implies that every automorphism of the intersection form of a closed, simply connected, oriented 4-manifold is realised by a self-homeomorphism of M .

The following special case, when F = 0, is worth pointing out explicitly.

Corollary 11.3 (4-dimensional Poincaré conjecture). Every homotopy 4-sphere is homeomorphic to S 4 .

Proof. Let N be a homotopy 4-sphere. Then N and S 4 are closed, simply connected and oriented. Furthermore, H 2 (N ; Z) = 0 and the zero map H 2 (N ; Z) → H 2 (S 4 ; Z) is an isometry (between zero forms). By the last paragraph of Theorem 11.2, there is a homeomorphism N ∼ = S 4 realising this isometry. Note that since N has trivial and therefore even intersection form, ks(N ) = σ(N )/8 = 0 by Theorem 8.2 (6).  An isotopy of homeomorphisms gives rise to a pseudo-isotopy. Quinn proves that the converse holds for compact simply connected 4-manifolds [Qui86] (see also [Per86]), but it is open whether pseudo-isotopy implies isotopy for homeomorphisms between 4-manifolds with nontrivial fundamental groups.

Theorem 11.6. Fix a triple (F, θ, k), where F is a finitely generated free Z[Z]-module, θ is a hermitian, nonsingular, sesquilinear form θ : F × F → Z[Z], and k ∈ Z/2. If θ is even, then suppose that σ(R ⊗ θ)/8 ≡ k ∈ Z/2. The last sentence of this theorem is a correction to [FQ90,Theorem 10.7A] by Stong and Wang [SW00].

Here is another family of groups for which a complete classification of closed orientable 4manifolds up to homeomorphism is known. This is the family of solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups
B(k) := a, b | aba −1 b −k .
Note that B(0) = Z and B(1) = Z 2 . Baumslag-Solitar groups are solvable and, as we pointed out above, solvable groups are good. The next classification result was worked out by Hambleton, Kreck and Teichner in [HKT09]. There is also a precise realisation result for these invariants [HKT09, Theorem B] and 4-manifolds with fundamental group B(k).

Next, 4-manifolds with finite cyclic fundamental groups were studied by Hambleton and Kreck in [HK88,HK93]. Given a finitely generated abelian group G, let T G be its torsion subgroup and let F G := G/T G.

Theorem 11.9. Let G be a finite cyclic group and let M and N be closed, oriented 4manifolds with fundamental group isomorphic to G. Suppose that there is an isomorphism φ : FH 2 (M ; Z) → FH 2 (N ; Z) such that the following hold.

(1) The map φ induces an isometry between the intersection form λ M : FH 2 (M ; Z) × To state a full realisation result for the invariants in Theorem 11.9 would require taking account of the interdependency between these invariants. However, a partial realisation result is given by the following outlined construction. For every finite cyclic group G, [HK93, Proposition 4.1] produces rational homology spheres with w 2 -type II and III, and with fundamental group G. In w 2 -type II, a rational homology sphere must have Kirby-Siebenmann invariant zero, since for spin manifolds M ks(M ) ≡ σ(M )/8 ∈ Z/2, and the signature of a rational homology sphere vanishes. In w 2 -type III, [HK93, Proposition 4.1] gives two rational homology spheres, one with vanishing Kirby-Siebenmann invariant, and one with nonvanishing Kirby-Siebenmann invariant.

(1) By taking the connected sum with a closed, spin simply connected manifold, we can realise any even, nonsingular, symmetric, bilinear form as the intersection form λ M : FH 2 (M ; Z) × FH 2 (M ; Z) → Z of a closed, oriented 4-manifold M with fundamental group G and with w 2 type II. In this case ks(M ) is determined by the signature of λ M .

(2) Likewise we can realise every even λ M as the intersection form of a closed, oriented 4-manifold M with fundamental group G and with w 2 type III, with prescribed Kirby-Siebenmann invariant.

(3) Finally, by taking connected sum with a closed, oriented, simply connected 4manifold, we can realise any odd, nonsingular, symmetric, bilinear form as the intersection form λ M : FH 2 (M ; Z) × FH 2 (M ; Z) → Z of a closed, oriented 4-manifold M with fundamental group G and with w 2 type I, with prescribed Kirby-Siebenmann invariant. Some partial results towards a classification for 4-manifolds whose fundamental groups are good and have cohomological dimension 3 appear in [HH18].

For nonorientable closed 4-manifolds, the homeomorphism classification results we are aware of are for fundamental group Z/2 in [HKT94] and for fundamental group Z in [Wan95]. For nonorientable closed 4-manifolds with fundamental group Z/2, the paper [HKT94] gives a complete list of invariants for distinguishing such manifolds up to homeomorphism [HKT94, Theorem 2], and gives a list of the possible manifolds [HKT94, Theorem 3].

Finally, simply-connected compact 4-manifolds with a fixed 3-manifold as boundary were classified by Boyer in [Boy86,Boy93] and independently by Stong [Sto93].


## Stable smoothing of homeomorphisms

Wall [Wal64] proved that simply connected, closed, smooth 4-manifolds with isometric intersection forms are stably diffeomorphic. It follows that every pair of simply connected, closed, homeomorphic smooth 4-manifolds are stably diffeomorphic. We shall discuss the analogous statement without the simply connected hypothesis.

Definition 12.1.

(1) Let M and N be connected, smooth 4-manifolds. We say that M and N are stably diffeomorphic if there is an integer k such that the connected sums M # k S 2 × S 2 and N # k S 2 × S 2 are diffeomorphic.

(2) Let M and N be connected 4-manifolds. We say that M and N are stably homeomorphic if there is an integer k such that the connected sums M # k S 2 × S 2 and N # k S 2 × S 2 are homeomorphic.

The next theorem is due to Gompf [Gom84].

Theorem 12.2. Every homeomorphic pair of compact, connected, orientable, smooth 4manifolds with diffeomorphic boundaries are stably diffeomorphic.

One might imagine a stronger statement, that given a homeomorphism f : M → N we can smoothen it stably. However such a statement is only known, given a lift of the stable tangent microbundle classifying map to BO, for simply connected 4-manifolds [FQ90,Chapter 8].

The proof of Theorem 12.2 that we shall give using Kreck's modified surgery [Kre99] was outlined in Teichner's thesis [Tei92, Theorem 5.1.1].

Gompf also proved that for every pair of compact, connected, nonorientable, smooth 4-manifolds M and N that are homeomorphic, M #S 2 ×S 2 and N #S 2 ×S 2 are stably diffeomorphic. We shall slightly improve on this statement. The hypothesis that w 2 ( M ) = 0 = w 2 ( N ) cannot be dropped in general. Cappell and Shaneson found an example of a smooth 4-manifold R that is homotopy equivalent to RP 4 but that is not stably diffeomorphic to RP 4 [CS71,CS76]. When these papers were published, it was not possible to prove that the fake RP 4 manifold R is homeomorphic to RP 4 , but this was later established [Rub84, p. 221] as a consequence of the work of Freedman and Quinn [FQ90], and the fact that the Whitehead group of Z/2 is trivial.

Later, Kreck [Kre84] showed a much more general statement in this direction. Let K3 denote the Kummer surface, a closed, smooth, spin 4-manifold with signature 16 and b 2 (K3) = 22. Here is Kreck's result from [Kre84].

Theorem 12.4. Let π be a finitely presented group with a surjective homomorphism w : π → Z/2. Then there exists a closed, smooth, connected 4-manifold W with fundamental group π and orientation character w, with the property that W #K3 and W # 11 S 2 × S 2 are homeomorphic 4-manifolds that are not stably diffeomorphic.

One part of this is easy to see: if W is nonorientable then there are homeomorphisms
W #K3 ∼ = W #E 8 #E 8 # 3 S 2 × S 2 ∼ = W #E 8 #E 8 # 3 S 2 × S 2 ∼ = W # 8 S 2 × S 2 # 3 S 2 × S 2 ∼ = W # 11 S 2 × S 2 .
Here we used Theorem 11.2 that simply connected closed 4-manifolds with Kirby-Siebenmann invariant vanishing are determined by their intersection forms, and we used that the connected sum M #N of an oriented manifold M with a nonorientable manifold N is homeomorphic to M #N . Gompf's statement for the nonorientable case, given in the next corollary, follows easily from Theorem 12.3. However note that Theorem 12.3 shows that for many nonorientable 4-manifolds, the extra summand given by the twisted bundle S 2 ×S 2 is not necessary. Proof. Taking the connected sum of any 4-manifold with S 2 ×S 2 ∼ = CP 2 #CP 2 gives rise to a 4-manifold whose universal cover is not spin. The corollary therefore follows from Theorem 12.3.

In the following three sections we will prove Theorem 12.2 and Theorem 12.3. To keep the notation manageable we will only provide a proof for closed manifolds. 12.1. Kreck's modified surgery. Below we will state a theorem due to Kreck that relates stable diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds with bordism theory. This came as a corollary of Kreck's modified surgery theory [Kre99]. First we need some definitions from [Kre99]. (1) Here by definition a 2-coconnected map induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups π i for i ≥ 3 and induces an injection for i = 2. A 2-connected map induces a surjection on π 2 and an isomorphism on π 1 and π 0 .

(2) The data of a normal 1-type is ξ : B → BO. The existence of ν M is a condition on that data. Normal 1-types ξ : B → BO of a closed, connected smooth 4-manifold are fibre homotopy equivalent over BO, and thus we may speak of the normal 1-type of a smooth 4-manifold, and similarly for the topological version. Here are some of the key examples in the oriented case. We will give the details of the nonorientable case in Section 12.3.

Write π = π 1 (M ) and let w 2 ∈ H 2 (M ; Z/2) be the second Stiefel-Whitney class of M . There are three main cases for the normal 1-types of oriented, closed smooth 4-manifolds. For more details, see [KLPT17, Sections 2 and 3].

Lemma 12.9. Let M be a closed, oriented, connected, smooth 4-manifold.

(1) Suppose that we have w 2 ( M ) = 0. Then ξ : B = Bπ × BSO → BO is the normal 1-type of M , with the map ξ given by projection to BSO followed by the canonical map BSO → BO.

(2) Suppose that M is spin. Then ξ : B = Bπ × BSpin → BO is the normal 1-type of M , with the map ξ given by projection to BSpin followed by the canonical map BSpin → BO. Similarly there are three main cases for the normal 1-types of closed, oriented, connected 4-manifolds. Let STOP(n) be the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of R n fixing the origin and let STOP be the corresponding colimit of STOP(n). Let TOPSpin be the universal (2-fold) cover of STOP. Here π 1 (STOP) ∼ = π 1 (TOP) ∼ = π 1 (O) ∼ = Z/2. To see that π 1 (TOP) ∼ = π 1 (O) we use that there is a 6-connected map TOP / O → K(Z/2, 3) [KS77, Essay V, Section 5].

Lemma 12.10. Let M be a closed, oriented, connected 4-manifold.

(1) Suppose that we have w 2 ( M ) = 0. Then ξ : B = Bπ × BSTOP → BTOP is the normal 1-type of M , with the map given by projection to BSTOP followed by the canonical map BSTOP → BTOP. Sketch of the proof. One direction is quite easy: one has to check that M and M #S 2 × S 2 are bordant over the normal 1-type of M .

For the other direction, start with a 5-dimensional bordism W over (B, ξ) and perform surgery on W below the middle dimension to make the map to B 1-connected. Now represent the elements of ker(π 2 (W ) → π 2 (B)) by framed embedded spheres, and remove thickenings of these spheres. Also remove tubes of these to either M or N , tubing enough 2-spheres to either side so as to preserve the Euler characteristic equality. This operation of removing copies of S 2 × D 3 , tubed to the boundary, has the effect of adding copies of S 2 × S 2 to M and N giving rise to M and N respectively, and it converts W to an scobordism W . That (W ; M , N ) is an s-cobordism means by definition that the inclusion maps M → W and N → W are simple homotopy equivalences. The stable s-cobordism theorem [Qui83] states that every 5-dimensional s-cobordism becomes diffeomorphic to a product after adding copies of S 2 ×S 2 ×I along a smoothly embedded interval I ⊂ W with one endpoint on each of M and N . This completes the sketch proof of Theorem 12.11.

The proof of the topological version is similar. From now on, to ease notation, we will abbreviate Ω TOP 4 (B TOP , ξ TOP ) with Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ).

Proof. One direction is again quite easy: we need that homeomorphic manifolds are bordant over B, and that M and M #S 2 × S 2 are bordant in Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ). For the other direction, apply the same argument as above to improve a cobordism W to an s-cobordism. The stable s-cobordism theorem applies to topological s-cobordisms as well as to smooth s-cobordisms. This is not written in [Qui83], but the same proof applies, with the following additions (see the Exercise on [FQ90, p. 107]). First, 5-dimensional cobordisms admit a topological handlebody structure [FQ90, Theorem 9.1]. The proof of [Qui83] consists of simplifying a handle decomposition, and tubing surfaces in 4-manifolds around and into parallel copies of one another to remove intersections. This is possible in the topological category by using transversality (Theorem 10.3) to arrange that intersections between surfaces are isolated points, and the existence of normal bundles (Theorem 6.17) to take parallel copies using sections.

12.2. Stable diffeomorphism of homeomorphic orientable 4-manifolds. Now we will explain the proof of Theorem 12.2. For the convenience of the reader, we recall the statement.

Theorem 12.13. Every homeomorphic pair of closed, connected, orientable, smooth 4manifolds are stably diffeomorphic.

The proof will rest on the following proposition.

Proposition 12.14. Let (B, ξ) be one of the oriented smooth normal 1-types from Lemma 12.9, and let (B TOP , ξ TOP ) be the corresponding topological normal 1-type from Lemma 12.10 obtained by replacing BSO with BSTOP or BSpin with BTOPSpin as appropriate. The forgetful map is injective.

The combination of this proposition with Theorem 12.11 and Theorem 12.12 implies the following corollary, which is the closed version of Theorem 12.2, with a slightly more precise statement concerning orientations.

Corollary 12.15. Every pair of smooth, closed, connected, oriented 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic via an orientation preserving homeomorphism are stably diffeomorphic via an orientation preserving diffeomorphism.

Proof. We prove the corollary assuming Proposition 12.14. Homeomorphic 4-manifolds are in particular stably homeomorphic and have the same normal 1-types. Therefore two homeomorphic smooth 4-manifolds as in the statement of the corollary are bordant over the normal 1-type, so give rise to equal elements in Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ). By Proposition 12.14, they give rise to equal elements of Ω 4 (B, ξ). Then by Theorem 12.11, the two 4-manifolds are stably diffeomorphic, as asserted.

Proof of Proposition 12.14. Let S be SO in case (1) of the smooth list of 1-types above, and let S denote Spin in cases (2) and (3).

Let ST be STOP in case (1) of the topological list of 1-types above, and let ST denote TOPSpin in cases (2) and (3).

The James spectral sequence [Tei92, Theorem 3.1.1],[KLPT17, Section 3] is of the form: ξ). We have that Ω S 4 ∼ = Z, detected by the signature. Indeed, the signature is a Z-valued invariant for stable diffeomorphisms. This arises on the E 2 page as H 0 (Bπ; Ω S 4 ) ∼ = Z. Claim. This term H 0 (Bπ; Ω S 4 ) survives to the E ∞ page. That is, all differentials with this as codomain are trivial.
E 2 p,q = H p (Bπ; Ω S q ) ⇒ Ω p+q (B,
Let us prove the claim. Since Ω S q is torsion for q = 1, 2, 3, no terms from those q-lines can map to H 0 (Bπ; Ω S 4 ) under a differential. . There could be a differential H 5 (Bπ; Ω S 0 ) → H 0 (Bπ; Ω S 4 ). However if there were a nonzero differential, then only finitely many signatures would occur for 4-manifolds with normal 1type B and fixed invariant in H 4 (Bπ; Ω S 0 ). But we can add copies of either CP 2 or the K3-surface to keep the normal 1-type and c * ([M ]) the same, but change the signature by 1 or 16, for each copy of CP 2 or K3, respectively. This completes the proof of the claim that the term H 0 (Bπ; Ω S 4 ) survives to the E ∞ page. We note that in case (3), the entry in Ω Spin 4 is not necessarily the signature of the manifold; this entry could be a multiple of the signature.

Since H 0 (Bπ; Ω S 4 ) survives to the E ∞ term, we have a short exact sequence: 0 → Ω S 4 → Ω 4 (B, ξ) → Ω 4 (B, ξ) → 0, where Ω 4 (B, ξ) denotes the quotient. That is, there is a filtration with iterated graded quotients given by the E ∞ page:
0 ⊆ E ∞ 4,0 = Ω S 4 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Ω 4 (B, ξ)
, and it is the quotient by the E ∞ 4,0 subgroup that we denote Ω 4 (B, ξ). Similarly, for the topological case, we have
0 → Ω ST 4 → Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ) → Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ) → 0.
The only difference in the proof from the smooth case is that we use E 8 in place of K3 in the argument that no differential has nontrivial image in H 0 (Bπ; Ω ST 4 ), and we also have to argue that the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant Z/2 ⊂ Ω ST 4 survives to the E ∞ page. But the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant is additive, and realised on simply connected manifolds, either by the Chern manifold * CP 2 (Construction 8.5) or the E 8 manifold depending on the normal 1-type. Thus there exist bordism classes (i.e. stable homeomorphism classes) realising both trivial and nontrivial Kirby-Siebenmann invariants within a normal 1-type, and so this Z/2 cannot be killed by a differential.

Since the structure forgetting map Ω S q → Ω ST q is an isomorphism for 0 ≤ q ≤ 3, we have an isomorphism Ω 4 (B, ξ) ∼ = Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ). This uses that the differentials agree, by naturality of the James spectral sequence with respect to homology theories. Indeed, note that the differentials depend only on the classifying space Bπ, and on the complex line bundle E → Bπ in case (3). Both are category independent.

Then there is a map of short exact sequences:
0 / / Ω S 4 / / Ω 4 (B, ξ) / / Ω 4 (B, ξ) / / ∼ = 0 0 / / Ω ST 4 / / Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ) / / Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ) / / 0.
The left vertical map is injective, either inclusion into the first summand Z → Z ⊕ Z/2 for non-spin or 16Z → 8Z in the spin case. Since the left and right vertical maps are injective, it follows from a diagram chase that the central vertical map is also injective, as required.

12.3. Non-orientable 4-manifolds and stable diffeomorphism. For the convenience of the reader, we recall the statement of Theorem 12.3. These normal 1-types gives rise to a James spectral sequence governing the bordism groups of (B, ξ) E 2 p,q = H p (Bπ; Ω w 1 q ) ⇒ Ω p+q (B, ξ).

Note that the coefficients are twisted using Z w 1 ⊗ Ω q , where by definition, g ∈ π acts on Z w 1 by multiplication by (−1) w 1 (g) . The corresponding topological James spectral sequence is: ξ). As in the previous section, here we abbreviate Ω TOP 4 (B TOP , ξ TOP ) with Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ). By Kreck's theorem (Theorem 12.11) and the argument in the proof of Theorem 12.2, in order to prove Theorem 12.3 it suffices to prove the next injectivity statement. is injective.
E 2 p,q = H p (Bπ; (Ω STOP q ) w 1 ) ⇒ Ω TOP p+q (B,
Proof of Theorem 12.3 assuming Proposition 12.19. Since homeomorphic 4-manifolds have the same normal 1-types and so are trivially TOP bordant over this normal 1-type, injectivity of F implies that homeomorphic nonorientable, closed, connected, smooth 4-manifolds are smoothly bordant over their normal 1-type, and therefore by Theorem 12.11 are stably diffeomorphic.

Proof of Proposition 12.19. The structure of the proof is very similar to that of the proof of Proposition 12.14. This proof is therefore somewhat terse. In the smooth James spectral sequence computing Ω 4 (B, ξ), we consider the term on the E 2 page H 0 (Bπ; Ω w 1 4 ) ∼ = Z/2. This is detected by the Euler characteristic of the manifold modulo two.

Since we can add a copy of CP 2 (note that for nonorientable manifolds connected sum with CP 2 and CP 2 is the same), both mod 2 Euler characteristics are realised by bordism classes over (B, ξ). Also note that adding CP 2 does not change the normal 1-type when w 2 ( M ) = 0. Therefore H 0 (Bπ; Ω w 1 4 ) ∼ = Z/2 survives to the E ∞ page. In the topological case, the corresponding term in the James spectral sequence computing Ω TOP
4 (B, ξ) is H 0 (Bπ; (Ω STOP 4 ) w 1 ) ∼ = Z/2 ⊕ Z/2.
We can add copies of CP 2 and * CP 2 to show that this term survives to the E ∞ page.
The structure forgetting map Z/2 ∼ = H 0 (Bπ; Ω w 1 4 ) → H 0 (Bπ; (Ω STOP 4 ) w 1 ) ∼ = Z/2 ⊕ Z/2 is injective.
Therefore the filtrations of Ω 4 (B, ξ) and Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ) arising from the spectral sequence give rise to short exact sequences, that form the rows of the following commutative diagram:
0 / / Z/2 / / Ω 4 (B, ξ) / / Ω 4 (B, ξ) / / ∼ = 0 0 / / Z/2 ⊕ Z/2 / / Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ) / / Ω TOP 4 (B, ξ) / / 0.
We noted above that the left vertical map is injective. Since Ω q → Ω STOP q is an isomorphism for 0 ≤ q ≤ 3, the right vertical map is an isomorphism and is therefore injective. It follows from a diagram chase that the central vertical map is also injective, as required.


## Twisted intersection forms and twisted signatures

Let M be a compact, orientable, connected 4m-dimensional manifold. We write π := π 1 (M ). Let α : π → U (k) be a unitary representation. We view the elements of C k as row vectors. Given g ∈ π and v ∈ C k , define v · g := v · α(g). Thus we can view C k as a right Z[π]-module. Denote this module by C k α . Define the twisted intersection form of (M, α) to be the form
Q M : H 2m (M ; C k α ) × H 2m (M ; C k α ) PD −1 × PD −1 − −−−−−−− → H 2m (M, ∂M ; C k α ) × H 2m (M, ∂M ; C k α ) ↓ Y H 4m (M, ∂M ; C k α ⊗ C k α ) ↓ , H 4m (M, ∂M ; C) ↓ PD H 0 (M ; C) = C.
Here the first and the last map are given by the isomorphisms from the Poincaré duality theorem A.15 and the second map is given by Lemma A.11. Note that in the bottom we view C as a trivial Z[π]-module. The third map is induced by the following homomorphism of right Z[π]-modules:
C k α ⊗ C k α → C (v, w) → v, w = vw T .
It follows easily from the definitions that Q M is sesquilinear, namely C-conjugate linear in the first entry and C-linear in the second entry. The usual proof for the (anti-) symmetry of the cup product e.g. [Hat02, Theorem 3.14], can be modified to show that the above pairing is hermitian, that is for every v, w ∈ H 2m (M ; C k α ) we have Q M (v, w) = Q M (w, v). Since Q M is hermitian, its signature is defined as the difference in the number of positive and negative eigenvalues. We refer to the signature of Q M as the twisted signature σ(M, α).

Finally, for a group homomorphism γ : π 1 (M ) → Γ, denote the corresponding L 2signature by σ (2) (M, γ), as defined in say [Ati76,Lüc02] and [COT03, Chapter 5]. Proof. For smooth manifolds, the first statement is a consequence of the Hirzebruch signature theorem (see e.g. [MS74]) while the second statement was proven in [APS75] (in fact the second statement contains the first statement as a special case). The third statement was proven in [Ati76,p. 44]. We will prove the second statement of the theorem. The other statements can be proved in a similar fashion. We refer to [COT03, Lemma 5.9] for a proof of (3).

So let M be a closed oriented 4-manifold and let α : π 1 (M ) → U (k) be a unitary representation. By Theorem 8.6, there exists a closed orientable simply-connected 4manifold N such that M #N is smooth. We have π 1 (M #N ) = π 1 (M ) * π 1 (N ) ∼ = π 1 (M ) since π 1 (N ) = {1}. Let β : π 1 (N ) → U (k) be the trivial representation. We also write α * β : π 1 (M #N ) = π 1 (M ) → U (k) for the representation uniquely determined by α on π 1 (M ).

By Proposition 5.15, we have σ(M #N ) = σ(M ) + σ(N ). Furthermore a slight generalisation of Proposition 5.15 shows that σ(M #N, α * β) = σ(M, α) + σ (N, β). Finally, we have σ(N, β) = k · σ(N ). The desired statement follows from these equalities and from the formula for twisted signatures of the closed smooth manifold M #N .

14. Reidemeister torsion in the topological category 14.1. The simple homotopy type of a manifold. In the following we need the notion of a simple homotopy equivalence. We will not give a definition, instead we refer to [Tur01,p. 40] for details. Roughly, a simple homotopy equivalence between CW complexes is a sequence of elementary expansions and collapses of pairs of cells whose dimension differs by one.

The following definition allows us to define a simple homotopy type even for topological spaces which are not homeomorphic to a CW complex. 
(X, Y ) → (X , Y ) such that s • f is homotopic to f and s| Y • f | V : V → Y is homotopic to f | V .
Such an equivalence class of (W, V, f, X, Y ) is called a simple homotopy type of (W, V ). In particular, a simple homotopy type of (W, ∅) is called a simple homotopy type of W .

Consider now a compact connected n-manifold M . If M admits a smooth structure, then M admits in particular a CW structure [Hir94, Section 6.4], and we equip M with the simply homotopy type given by (M, Id). By Chapman's theorem [Cha74,p. 488] below, this simple homotopy type is independent of the choice of CW structure on M .

Theorem 14.2 (Chapman). Let W be a compact topological space. Any two CW structures on W are simple homotopy equivalent.

As we pointed out in Section 4, it is unknown whether every compact manifold admits a CW structure. In the remainder of this section, we will nonetheless introduce the simple homotopy type of a compact manifold M following [KS77, Essay III, Section 4]. The first step is to construct a disc bundle D(M ) → M together with a PL structure on the total space D(M ). We will work with a compact m-dimensional manifold M with boundary ∂M , and seek to construct the simple homotopy type of (M, ∂M ).  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000  00000000000000000000000   11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111  11111111111111111111111   0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000  0000000000000000000000   1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  1111111111111111111111  Construction 14.3. We deal with the case ∂M = ∅ first, and then later address the additional complications arising from having nonempty boundary.

As a first step to constructing the disc bundle D(M ) ⊂ R n , we need an embedding of M into R n−1 for some large integer n − 1 > 2m + 5. For a closed m-manifold M such an embedding is readily available [Hat02,Corollary A.9]. It follows from Theorem 7.10 that for n − 1 > 2m + 5 all such embeddings of M are isotopic, and that they admit a normal microbundle ν R n−1 (M ) that is unique up to isotopy. By Theorem 7.7 this normal microbundle ν R n−1 (M ) can be upgraded to a topological R n−1−m -bundle. By taking the product with R, construct an embedding M ⊂ R n whose normal microbundle is ν(M ) = ν R n−1 (M ) × R. Since we stabilised once, the normal microbundle ν(M ) contains a normal disc bundle B(M ) [KS77, Essay III, Proposition 4.4].

The next big step will be to upgrade B(M ) ⊂ R n from a submanifold to a PL submanifold. Since the interior is codimension 0, the interior of B(M ) is automatically also a PL submanifold. However, we have to arrange ∂B(M ) to be a PL submanifold of R n itself. In the next paragraphs, we modify the PL structure on R n such that ∂B(M ) becomes a PL submanifold and then isotope this new PL structure on R n back to the standard PL structure.

Using the Collar Neighbourhood Theorem 2.5, pick a collar W ∂ = ∂B(M ) × (−1, 1) and
D ∂ = ∂B(M ) × [− 1 2 , 1 2 ].
The local product structure theorem 5.18 [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.2] gives a PL structure σ ∂ on R n such that ∂B(M ) is a PL submanifold and σ ∂ is concordant to the standard PL structure σ std . Now we will isotope the pair ∂B(M ) ⊂ B(M ) so that they become PL submanifolds of (R n , σ std ). The PL structure σ ∂ is concordant to σ std . Since concordance implies isotopy [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 4.1] in dimension m ≥ 6, there is an isotopy φ t ∈ Homeo(R n ) such that φ 0 = Id, and φ * 1 σ std = σ ∂ . Consequently, D(M ) := φ 1 (B(M )) and D(∂M ) := φ 1 (B(∂M )) are PL submanifolds of (R n , σ std ), which defines a simple type of M .

Having finished the case ∂M = ∅, next we discuss the procedure for a manifold M with non-empty boundary.

Take Our first goal is to modify the PL structure on R n so that the corners X become a PL submanifold of R n . Denote the standard PL structure on R n by σ std . Pick a bicollar ∂B(M ) × [−1, 1] ⊂ R n of the boundary of the codimension 0 submanifold B(M ). Again by the Collar Neighbourhood Theorem 2.5, we can pick a bicollar X × [−1, 1] ⊂ ∂B(M ). We consider the open set W X := X ×(−1, 1) 2 ⊂ ∂B(M )×(−1, 1) ⊂ R n , and D X = X ×[− 1 2 , 1 2 ] 2 . The local product structure theorem 5.18 [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.2] gives a PL structure on X and a PL structure σ X on R n , which is concordant to σ std rel. R n \ X × (− 2 3 , 2 3 ) 2 . This PL structure σ X has the property that it agrees with the product PL structure on X × (−1, 1) 2 in a neighbourhood of D X . Thus X is a PL submanifold of (R n , σ X ). Now we arrange the next stratum ∂B(M ) ⊃ X to be a PL submanifold of R n . Near D X = X × [− 1 2 , 1 2 ], the PL structure σ X is the product PL structure, and therefore ∂B(M ) ∩ Int D X = X × (− 1 2 , 1 2 ) × {0} is already a PL submanifold of (R n , σ X ). Furthermore, σ X is a product along (
− 1 2 , 1 2 ) near X × [− 1 3 , 1 3 ]. Pick W ∂ = ∂B(M ) × (−1, 1), C ∂ = X × [− 1 3 , 1 3 ] × [− 1 3 , 1 3 ] and D ∂ = ∂B(M ) × [− 1 2 , 1 2 ].
As above, the local structure theorem 5.18 [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.2] gives a PL structure σ ∂ on R n such that ∂B(M ) is a PL submanifold and σ ∂ is concordant to σ X rel. R n \ ∂B(M ) × (− 2 3 , 2 3 ) ∪ C ∂ . Since X ⊂ C ∂ the submanifold X is still a PL submanifold of (R n , σ ∂ ).

As in the closed case, use a concordance from σ ∂ to σ std to obtain an isotopy φ t ∈ Homeo(R n ) such that φ 0 = Id, and φ * 1 σ std = σ ∂ . Define D(M ) := φ 1 (B(M )) and D(∂M ) := φ 1 (B(∂M )), which are both PL submanifolds of (R n , σ std ). This finishes the case where M has nonempty boundary.

In both cases, ∂M empty and non-empty, our construction involved many choices. Let D (∂M ) ⊂ D (M ) be obtained by other choices. Following the discussion [KS77, p. 123], we can suitably stabilise the bundles and find a commutative diagram of PL maps:
D(M ) × D s D (M ) × D r D(∂M ) × D s D (∂M ) × D r , ∼ = ∼ =
where D k denotes the disc with its standard PL structure and the horizontal maps are PL isomorphisms that preserve the zero sections up to homotopy. Remark 14.5. Why is the simply homotopy type of ∂M obtained in this way the same as that obtained by applying Construction 14.3 with ∂M considered as a manifold without boundary?

For suitably high n, we may assume that the embedding of (M, ∂M ) into R n is isotopic, and thus by Theorem 2.10 ambiently isotopic, to an embedding with i : ∂M → { x ∈ R n | x 1 = 0} ∼ = R n−1 and an (interior) collar ∂M × [0, 1] embedded as a product in { x ∈ R n | 0 ≤ x 1 ≤ 1} with (x, t) → (i(x), t), as in Theorem 6.5. Such an isotopy does not affect the simple homotopy type obtained, by the argument sketched above, which can also be found on [KS77,p. 123]. The simple homotopy type of ∂M obtained from Construction 14.3, via an embedding of ∂M into R n−1 , uses a disc bundle D(∂M ) that stabilises using the x 1 direction to a disc bundle D (∂M ), with fibre a disc of one dimension higher, for ∂M embedded in R n . This latter disc bundle gives rise to the canonical simply homotopy type of ∂M from Definition 14.4.

Remark 14.6. If M is a smooth manifold, then M has an underlying PL structure, and with a bit more care in Construction 14.3, we can arrange that the bundle D(M ) is a PL bundle. Note that this is stronger than just a PL structure on the total space. For PL bundles, the bundle projection D(M ) → M is a simple homotopy equivalence. Indeed, for trivial bundles this is discussed above, and in general the projection is an α-equivalence (a notion defined in loc. cit.) for any cover α of M and so is simple [Fer77,Corollary 3.2]. It follows that the simple homotopy type defined by (M, Id) agrees with the one of (M, s), and the same holds for the relative simple homotopy type of the pair (M, ∂M ).

According to [KS77, Essay III, Theorem 5.11], if a manifold has a triangulation, then the simple homotopy type of the manifold agrees with the simple homotopy type of that triangulation. It is not clear to us whether the analogous statement holds if M has a CW-structure not coming from a triangulation.

14.2. The cellular chain complex and Poincaré triads. Throughout this section let M be a compact connected n-manifold. Furthermore assume that we are given a decomposition ∂M = R − ∪ R + into codimension zero submanifolds such that ∂R − = R − ∩ R + = ∂R + .

The following proposition follows from the argument of Construction 14.3, applied with even more iterations to deal with corners of corners. See also the proof of [KS77, Essay III, Theorem 5.13].

Proposition 14.7. There exists a finite CW-complex triad (X, X − , X + ) and a homotopy equivalence of triads f : (M, R − , R + ) → (X, X − , X + ) such that the following two statements hold:

(1) The restrictions of f to M , R ± and R − ∩ R + give the simple homotopy types of these manifolds, as defined in the previous section. We continue with a general definition regarding CW complexes.

Definition 14.8. Let (X, Y ) be a pair of CW-complexes such that X is connected. We write π = π 1 (X) and we denote by p : X → X the universal covering. We define
C cell * (X, Y ; Z[π]) := Z[π] ⊗ Z[π] C cell * ( X, p −1 (Y )) C * cell (X, Y ; Z[π]) := Hom right-Z[π] (C cell * ( X, p −1 (Y )), Z[π]
). The group π acts freely on the left on the cells of the CW-complex ( X, p −1 (Y )). For each cell in X, pick a lift to X. This turns C cell * (X, Y ; Z[π]) and C * cell (X, Y ; Z[π]) into based Z[π]-module (co-) chain complexes. Now we can state the main theorem of this section.

Theorem 14.9. The finite CW-complex triad (X, X − , X + ) is a simple Poincaré triad, meaning that there is a chain level representative σ ∈ C cell n (X,
X − ∪ X + ) of the fundamental class [X] ∈ H n (X, X + ∪ X − ; Z) = H n (M, ∂M ; Z) such that − X σ : C n−r cell (X, X − ; Z[π 1 (X)]) → C cell r (X, X + ; Z[π 1 (X)]
) is a simple chain homotopy equivalence.

The theorem is proved in [KS77,Essay III,Theorem 5.13]. In the Universal Poincaré Duality Theorem A.16 we will prove that there exists a homotopy equivalence between the two chain complexes. But we will not prove that there exists a simple homotopy equivalence; for that the reader will need to consult [KS77].

14.3. Reidemeister torsion. In this section we introduce Reidemeister torsion invariants for compact manifolds and discuss some of these key properties of these invariants.

Let M be a compact connected n-manifold and write π = π 1 (M ). Let R − be a compact codimension 0 submanifold of ∂M . In many applications R − = ∅ or R − = ∂M . We write R + = ∂M \ R − . Let F be a field and let α : π → GL(d, F ) be a representation of the fundamental group of M . With respect to this representation, we consider the twisted homology H k (M, R − ; F d ), as defined in Section A.1. Pick a homotopy equivalence of triads f : (M, R − , R + ) → (X, X − , X + ) as in Proposition 14.7. We use the homotopy equivalence f to make the identification π 1 (X) = π. By a serious abuse of notation, we refer to the cellular chain complex C cell * (X, X − ; Z[π]) of (X, X − ) as the cellular chain complex C cell * (M, R − ; Z[π]) of (M, R − ). As in Section 14.2 we view C cell * (M, R − ; Z[π]) as a based left Z[π]-module chain complex. Equip the F -module chain complex C cell
* (M, R − ; F d ) = F d ⊗ Z[π] C cell * (M, R − ; Z[π]
) with the basing given by the tensor products of the Z[π]-bases of C cell * (M, R − ; Z[π]) and the canonical F -basis for F d . We write ∼ α for the equivalence relation on F × := F \ {0} that is given by the subgroup {± det(αg) | g ∈ π 1 (M )} ⊂ F × . We define τ (M, R − , α) ∈ F × / ∼ α to be the Reidemeister torsion of the above acyclic, based F -module chain complex. We refer to [Tur01,Section 6] for the definition of the Reidemeister torsion of an acyclic, based F -module chain complex. It follows from a slight generalisation of [Tur01, Theorem 9.1] that τ (M, R − , α) ∈ F × / ∼ α is well-defined, in that it is independent of the choice of the representative of the simple homotopy type of (X, X − , X + ) and it is independent of the choice of the lifts of the cells.

The following two theorems give the two arguably most important properties of torsion.

Theorem 14.11. Let M be a compact connected n-manifold and let R − be a compact codimension 0 submanifold of ∂M . Let α : π 1 (M ) → GL(d, F ) be such that H * (R − ; F d ) = 0 = H * (M ; F d ). By abuse of notation we also write α for the composition α : π 1 (∂M ) → π 1 (M ) → GL(d, F ) defined for each connected component of ∂M using the basing paths as described above. Then we have
τ (M, α) = τ (R − , α) · τ (M, R − , α) ∈ F × / ∼ α .
Proof. We have the following short exact sequence of chain complexes with compatible bases:
0 → C cell * (X − ; F d ) → C cell * (X; F d ) → C cell * (X, X − ; F d ) → 0.
Given such a short exact sequence, the multiplicativity of the torsion is proven in [Tur01,Theorem 3.4].

Definition 14.12. Let F be a field with (possibly trivial) involution. Given a representation α : π → GL(d, F ) we denote the representation g → α(g −1 )

T by α † . We say that α is
unitary if α = α † .
Example 14.13. Let φ : π → Z be a group homomorphism. Equip Q(t) with the usual involution given by t = t −1 . The representation α : π → GL(1, Q(t)) given by g → t φ(g) is unitary.

Theorem 14.14. Let M be a compact n-manifold with (possibly empty) boundary. Assume that we are given a decomposition ∂M = R − ∪ R + into codimension zero submanifolds such that ∂R − = R − ∩ R + = ∂R + . Furthermore let F be a field with (possibly trivial) involution.
Let α : π 1 (M ) → GL(d, F ) be a representation such that H * (∂M ; F d ) = 0 = H * (M ; F d ). Then τ (M, R − , α) = τ (M, R + , α † ) (−1) n+1 in F × / ∼ α .
In particular, if α is unitary we have
τ (M, R − , α) = τ (M, R + , α) (−1) n+1 in F × / ∼ α .
Proof. We write π = π 1 (M ). Write C ± * = C cell * (M, R ± ; Z[π]), recalling the convention described below Assumption 14.10.

It follows from Theorem 14.9 that the torsion of the based F -module chain complex F d ⊗ Z[π] C − * agrees with the torsion of the based F -module chain complex
F d ⊗ Z[π] Hom right-Z[π] (C + n− * , Z[π]
). Consider the following isomorphism of based left F -module chain complexes
F d α ⊗ Z[π] Hom right-Z[π] (C + n− * , Z[π]) → Hom left-F (F d α † ⊗ Z[π] C + n− * , F ) v ⊗ ϕ → F d α † ⊗ Z[π] C + n− * → F (w ⊗ σ) → vα(ϕ(σ))w T
Using this isomorphism τ (M, R − , α) also equals the torsion of the chain complex on the right hand side. It follows from algebraic duality for torsions [Tur01,Theorem 1.9] that the torsion of the based chain complex on the right hand side equals τ (M, R + , α † )
(−1) n+1 .
15. Obstructions to being topologically slice 15.1. The Fox-Milnor Theorem. In this section we provide an example of the use of many of the theorems described above by applying them to obtain an obstructions for a knot to be topologically slice.

Definition 15.1. Let Y be a homology 3-sphere that is the boundary of an integral homology 4-ball X.

(1) We say a knot K in Y is topologically slice in X if K bounds a slice disc, that is a proper submanifold of X homeomorphic to a disc.

(2) Suppose X is equipped with a smooth structure, e.g. X = D 4 . We say a knot K in Y is smoothly slice in X if K bounds a smooth slice disc, that is a proper smooth submanifold of X diffeomorphic to a disc.

There are many classical obstructions to a knot being smoothly slice. For example, there are obstructions based on the Alexander polynomial [FM66] and the Levine-Tristram signatures [Tri69,Lev69] and there are the more subtle Casson-Gordon [CG78,CG86] obstructions. Even though these results, having appeared prior to the work of Freedman and Quinn, were formulated as obstructions to being smoothly slice, it has been understood for many years that the original proofs can be modified to prove that these are in fact obstructions to being topologically slice.

In this section we will prove the following sample theorem on the Alexander polynomial of a topologically slice knot.

Theorem 15.2 (Fox-Milnor). Suppose that K is a knot in a homology 3-sphere Y that bounds an integral homology 4-ball X. If K is slice in X, then the Alexander polynomial ∆ K (t) of K factors as ∆ K (t) = ±t k f (t)f (t −1 ) for some k ∈ Z and for some f (t) ∈ Z[t, t −1 ] such that f (1) = ±1.

Even though this result is very well known we want to provide a detailed proof. In particular we want to highlight where some of the results discussed in this article are used. The reader is encouraged to go through the other papers mentioned above and to modify the proofs to deal with topologically slice knots.


## 15.2.

A proof of the Fox-Milnor Theorem. For the proof of the Fox-Milnor Theorem 15.2 we adopt the following notation.

(1) Let Y be a homology 3-sphere Y bounding some integral homology 4-ball X.

(2) Given a knot K in Y , denote its zero framed surgery by N K .

(3) Given an oriented knot K let µ K be an oriented meridian.

(4) For a slice disc D in X, let N (D) be a tubular neighbourhood provided by Theorem 6.8. We refer to W D = X \ N (D) as the exterior of D. Many topological slicing obstructions, such as knot signatures [Tri69], the Fox-Milnor condition [FM66], the Blanchfield form [Kea75], Casson-Gordon invariants [CG78,CG86], L 2 -signature defects [COT03] and L (2) -von Neumann ρ-invariants [CT07], rely implicitly and explicitly on the next three propositions or slight variations thereof.

Proposition 15.3. Let K be an oriented knot in Y and let D be a slice disc in Y .

(1) We have ∂W D = N K .

(2) The inclusion map µ K → W D induces a Z-homology equivalence.

In the remainder of this section, given an oriented knot, we use φ : π 1 (N K ) → t and φ : π 1 (W D ) → t to denote the unique homomorphisms that send the oriented meridian to t. These homomorphisms allow us to view Z[t ±1 ] and Q(t) as a Z[π 1 (N K )]-module and a Z[π 1 (W D )]-module.

Proof. For the first statement, we have to check that the framing of K induced by the unique trivialisation νD ∼ = D 2 × R 2 is the 0-framing. Consider S 4 with an equatorial S 3 , which contains K and splits S 4 into two 4-balls. Let D be contained in the one 4-ball, and push a Seifert surface Σ into the other 4-ball. Pick a normal bundle νS 3 = S 3 × I, and arrange using Theorem 6.5 that D ∩ νS 3 = K × [−1, 0], and Σ ∩ νS 3 = K × [0, 1]. Let F = Σ ∪ −D ⊂ S 4 . We compute the Euler number e(F ) ∈ Z in two ways. First, note that e(F ) = [F ] · [F ] = 0, since H 2 (S 4 ; Z) = 0. On the other hand, the number e(F ) is also the difference between the induced framings of νΣ| K and νD| K . Consequently, the two framings agree and νD induces the 0-framing, which by definition is the framing induced by νΣ| K .

We turn to the proof of the second statement. By Proposition 6.13 the tubular neighbourhood of D is trivial, thus we can identify it with D × D 2 . Let µ K → W D be the inclusion of the meridian µ K of K. Then we have H * (W D , * × µ K ; Z) = H * (W D , D × S 1 ; Z) = H * (X, D × D 2 ) = 0 by excision and the hypothesis that X be a homology 4-ball. By the homology long exact sequence for the pair (W D , µ K ), the meridional map µ K → W D induces a homology equivalence, so W D is a homology circle.

Proposition 15.4. The exterior W D of a slice disc D is homotopy equivalent to a finite 3-dimensional CW complex. In particular the homology groups
H * (W D ; Z[t ±1 ]), H * (W D , N K ; Z[t ±1 ]) and H * (N K ; Z[t ±1 ])
are all finitely generated.

Proof. Note that W D is a compact 4-manifold with nonempty boundary. It follows from Theorem 4.5 that W D is homotopy equivalent to a 3-dimensional CW complex. The statements regarding the homology groups follow from Proposition A.9.

Proposition 15.5.

(1) For any knot K in a homology 3-sphere the modules H * (
N K ; Z[t ±1 ]) are Z[t ±1 ]- torsion.
(2) If D is a slice disc, then all the modules H * (W D ;
Z[t ±1 ]) are Z[t ±1 ]-torsion.
Proof. We start out with the proof of the second statement. Let P ⊂ Z[t ±1 ] be the multiplicative subset of Laurent polynomials that augment to ±1, that is p(1) = ±1 if and only if p ∈ P . We shall prove the slightly stronger statement, that H k (W D ;
Z[t ±1 ]) is P -torsion for k > 0. Since H 0 (W D ; Z[t ±1 ]) ∼ = Z[t ±1 ]/(t − 1) is Z[t ±1
]-torsion, the result will follow. We write π = π 1 (W D ). Let Q := P −1 Z[t ±1 ] be the result of inverting the polynomials in P . By Proposition A.5 there exists a chain complex C * of finite length consisting of finitely generated free left Z[π]-modules such that for any ring R and any (R, 
Z[π])-bimodule A we have H k (W D , µ K ; A) ∼ = H k (A ⊗ Z[π] C * ). By Proposition 15.3 we know that H k (Z ⊗ Z[π] C * ) = H k (W D , µ K ; Z) = 0. Since C *Q) = 0, so that H k (W D ; Z[t ±1 ]) is P -torsion for k > 0.
The first statement is very well known. One of the many proofs would be to use the above argument and the fact that S 1 → Y \ νK is a homology equivalence to show that the modules H * (Y \ νK; Z[t ±1 ]) are torsion. A basic Mayer-Vietoris argument then shows that the modules H * (N K ; Z[t ±1 ]) are also torsion.

We want to recall the definition of the Alexander polynomial of a knot. To do so we need the notion of the order of a module. In the proof of the Fox-Milnor theorem we will need the following lemma, collecting basic facts about orders of finitely generated Z[H]-modules.

Lemma 15.7. Let H be a finitely generated free abelian group.

(1) If 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence of finitely generated Z[H]modules, then ord(B) = ord(A) · ord(C).

(2) If 0 → C k → · · · → C 0 → 0 is an exact sequence of finitely generated Z[H]-torsion modules, then the alternating product of the orders is a unit in Z[H].  We use the notion of order to define the Alexander polynomial of a knot in a homology 3-sphere.

Definition 15.8. The Alexander polynomial ∆ K (t) of a knot K is defined as the order of the Alexander module H 1 (N K ; Z[t ±1 ]). Note that this polynomial is only well-defined up to units in Z[t ± ].

After these preparations we turn to the actual proof of the Fox-Milnor Theorem 15.2. We need the following elementary lemma.

Lemma 15.9. Let π be a group, let C * be a chain complex of left free Z[π]-modules and let φ : π → t be a homomorphism. The map
Hom right-Z[π] (C * , Z[t ±1 ]) → Hom left-Z[t ±1 ] (Z[t ±1 ] ⊗ Z[π] C * , Z[t ±1 ]) f → (p ⊗ σ → p · f (σ))
is well-defined and is an isomorphism of left Z[t ±1 ]-cochain complexes. We prove the second statement of the claim. The proof of the first statement is almost identical. By the Poincaré duality theorem A.15 we have an isomorphism H i (W D ; Λ) ∼ = H 4−i (W D , N K ; Λ) of Λ-modules. By Lemma 15.9, applied to C * = C * (W D , N K ; Z[π]), we know that
H 4−i (W D , N K ; Λ) ∼ = H 4−i (Hom Λ (Λ ⊗ Z[π] C * (W D , N K ; Z[π]), Λ)).
Finally we apply the universal coefficient spectral sequence [Lev77, Theorem 2.3] to the Λ-module chain complex C * (W D , N K ; Λ). It follows from the above observations (b) and (c) that the spectral sequence collapses and that we have an isomorphism
H 4−i Hom Λ (Λ ⊗ Z[π] C * (W D , N K ; Λ) ∼ = Ext 1 Λ (H 3−i (W D , N K ; Λ), Λ)
. This concludes the proof of the claim.

Next we consider the long exact sequence of the pair (W D , N K ) of twisted homology with Λ-coefficients:
· · · → H 2 (W D ; Λ) → H 2 (W D , N K ; Λ) → H 1 (N K ; Λ) → H 1 (W D ; Λ) → H 1 (W D , N K ; Λ) → . . .
It follows from Propositions 15.4 that all the above modules are finitely generated modules. Thus it makes sense to consider their orders. Also note that in Proposition 15.5 we saw that the modules for N K and W D are all Λ-torsion. It follows from the long exact sequence that the relative homology groups H * (W D , N K ; Λ) are also Λ-torsion. By Lemma 15.7 (3) the alternating product of the orders equals ±t k .

By the above claim and Lemma 15.7 (3) and (4) the orders are anti-symmetric around H 1 (N K ; Λ). More precisely, we have ord(H 2 (W D , N K ; Λ)) = ord Ext 1 Λ (H 1 (W D ; Λ), Λ) = ord(H 1 (W D ; Λ)), and the same type of relation holds as we progress further from the middle term H 1 (N K ; Λ) in the above long exact sequence. But this implies that there exist non-zero polynomials f, g ∈ Λ with f · f = ∆ K (t) · g · g. By considering irreducible factors, we obtain the desired result.

We conclude with an alternative argument for the Fox-Milnor theorem in the topological category using Reidemeister torsion. The advantage of the Reidemeister torsion invariant is that proofs are often easier, and it has in general a smaller indeterminacy than the order of homology, although this will not manifest itself in the upcoming proof.

Second proof of Theorem 15.2. We continue with the notation introduced above. As before we have a homomorphism α : π 1 (W D ) → H 1 (W D ; Z) − → Z, sending an oriented meridian of K to 1 ∈ Z. As usual Q(t) denotes the field of fractions of the Laurent polynomial ring Z[t, t −1 ]. We take d = 1, and so obtain a representation φ : π 1 (W D ) → GL(1, Q(t)), that sends g → (t α(g) ). In the previous proof we had already seen that the modules
H * (N K ; Z[t ±1 ]), H * (W D ; Z[t ±1 ]) and H * (N K ; Z[t ±1 ]) are Z[t ±1 ]-torsion. Since Q(t) is flat over Z[t ±1
] it follows that the corresponding twisted homology groups with Q(t)-coefficients are zero.

By the discussion in Section 14.3 we can consider the Reidemeister torsions τ (W D , φ), τ (N K , φ) and τ (W D , N K , φ). By Theorem 14.14, τ (W D , N K , φ) = τ (W D , φ)
(−1) 5 = τ (W D , φ) −1 .
Since the torsion is multiplicative in short exact sequences by Theorem 14.11, we have that
τ (W D , φ) = τ (N K , φ) · τ (W D , N K , φ) = τ (M K , φ) · τ (W D , φ) −1 .
By [Tur01,Theorem 14.12] the torsion of the zero surgery of a knot is equal to ∆ K (t)/((t − 1)(t −1 − 1)). It follows that ∆ K (t) is a norm as claimed.

Remark 15.10. The two proofs presented above avoid the use of the smooth category, and so are in keeping with the spirit of this article. However, one can give a further alternative proof by allowing smooth techniques. First one can use Theorem 8.6 to find a simply connected 4-manifold W such that W := V #W is smoothable. Then one can triangulate W and apply Reidemeister torsion machinery without appealing to [KS77,Essay III]. The disadvantage of this approach is that typically H 2 (W ; Z) will be nontrivial, so that W is not acyclic over Q(t). One can proceed by choosing a self-dual basis for homology, so that one can still obtain a torsion invariant that is well-defined up to norms. Apply [CF13, Theorem 2.4], and argue that since the intersection form of W is nonsingular, the contribution of W to the torsion is a norm.

Appendix A. Poincaré Duality with twisted coefficients

Surveying the literature, we felt it would be of benefit to have a more detailed proof of Poincaré duality with twisted coefficients for manifolds with boundary, but without a smooth or PL structure, so we offer one in this appendix. One can find other proofs of Poincaré duality for some subsets of these conditions. A.1. Twisted homology and cohomology groups. We start out with the following notation.

Notation A.1. Given a group π and a left Z[π]-module A, write A for the right Z[π 1 (M )]module that has the same underlying abelian group but for which the right action of π is defined by a · g := g −1 · a for a ∈ A and g ∈ π. The same notation is also used with the rôles of left and right reversed and g · a := a · g −1 .

We recall the definition of twisted homology and cohomology groups.

Definition A.2. Let X be a connected topological space that admits a universal cover p : X → X. Write π = π 1 (X). Let Y be a subset of X, let A be a right Z[π]-module. Let π act on X by deck transformations, which is naturally a left action. Thus, the singular chain complex C * ( X, p −1 (Y )) becomes a left Z[π]-module chain complex. Define the twisted chain complex C * (X, Y ; A) := A ⊗ Z[π] C * ( X, p −1 (Y )), Id ⊗∂ * .

The corresponding twisted homology groups are H k (X, Y ; A). With δ k = Hom(∂ k , Id) define the twisted cochain complex to be
C * (X, Y ; A) := Hom right-Z[π] C * ( X, p −1 (Y )), A , δ * .
The corresponding twisted cohomology groups are H k (X, Y ; A).

Note that if R is some ring (not necessarily commutative) and if A is an (R, Z[π])bimodule, then the above twisted homology and cohomology groups are naturally left R-modules.

Given a CW complex one can similarly define twisted cellular (co-) chain complexes and twisted cellular (co-) homology groups. The following proposition implies that twisted singular (co-) homology groups are isomorphic to twisted cellular (co-) homology groups.

Proposition A.3. Let (X, Y ) be a CW complex pair and write π = π 1 (X). The singular chain complexes C sing * (X, Y ; Z[π]) and C cell * (X, Y ; Z[π]) are chain equivalent as chain complexes of left Z[π]-modules.

The proof of Proposition A.3 relies on the following very useful lemma.

Lemma A.4. Let f : C * → D * be a chain map of free Z[π]-module chain complexes (here chain complexes are understood to start in degree 0) that induces an isomorphism on homology. Then f is a chain equivalence.

Proof. Since f induces an isomorphism of homology groups we know that the cone(f ) * is acyclic. By assumption C * and D * are free Z[π]-modules and so is cone(f ) * . But this guarantees the existence of a chain homotopy Id cone f * P 0, since we can view cone(f ) * as a free resolution of 0 and any two such resolutions are chain homotopic. Recall that chain homotopy means ∂ cone f * • P + P • ∂ cone f * = Id cone f * (A.1) If we write P as a matrix P n = P 11 n P 12 n P 21 n P 22
n : C n−1 D n → C n D n+1
then one easily verifies using Equation (A.1), that P 12 * : D * → C * is a chain homotopy inverse of f * , where the chain homotopies are given by P 11 * and P 22 * . Proof of Proposition A.3. In [Sch68,p. 303] (see also [Lüc98,Lemma 4.2]) it is shown that there exists a natural chain homotopy equivalence C sing * ( X, p −1 (Y )) → C cell * ( X, p −1 (Y )) of Z-modules, where p : X → X denotes the universal cover. Since the chain homotopy is natural it is in particular π-equivariant. In other words, it is a chain homotopy equivalence of Z[π]-modules. Now the proposition follows from Lemma A.4.

Proposition A.5. Let M be a compact n-manifold and let N ⊂ M be a subspace that is a compact manifold in its own right. Write π = π 1 (M ). There exists a chain complex C * of finite length consisting of finitely generated free left Z[π]-modules such that for any ring R and for any (R, Z[π])-bimodule A we have left R-module isomorphisms
H k (M, N ; A) ∼ = H k (A ⊗ Z[π] C * )
and A)).
H k (M, N ; A) ∼ = H k (Hom Z[π] (C * ,
Remark A.6. Note that we do not demand that N be a submanifold of M . For example N could be a union of boundary components of M , or N could be a submanifold of the boundary. Evidently N could also be the empty set.

Proof. By Theorem 4.5 the manifolds M and N are homotopy equivalent to finite CW complexes X and Y respectively. Let i : N → M be the inclusion map. By the cellular approximation theorem there exists a cellular map j : X → Y such that the following diagram commutes up to homotopy
N i / / M Y j / / X.
Next we replace M and X by the mapping cylinders of i and j respectively, to create cofibrations. Given a map f : U → V between topological spaces let cyl(f ) be the mapping cylinder. We view U as a subset of cyl(f ) in the obvious way. With this notation we have The mapping cylinder Z := cyl(j : Y → X) admits the structure of a finite CW complex such that Y is a subcomplex. Thus we can compute the twisted homology groups H k (cyl(j : X → Y ); A) using the relative twisted cellular chain complex, and similarly for cohomology. Put differently, C * = C cell * (Z, Y ; Z[π]) has the desired properties. In order to give a criterion for twisted homology modules to be finitely generated, we need the notion of a Noetherian ring.

Definition A.7. A ring R is said to be left Noetherian if for any descending chain R ⊇ I 1 ⊇ I 2 ⊇ I 3 ⊇ . . . of left R-ideals the inclusions eventually become equality.

Example A.8. The following rings are left Noetherian:

(1) The ring Z is Noetherian.

(2) Any (skew) field is left Noetherian.

(3) If A is a commutative Noetherian ring, then the multivariable Laurent polynomial ring A[t ±1 1 , . . . , t ±1 k ] is also Noetherian [Lan02a, Corollary IV.9.5]. The following theorem is often implicitly used. Proposition A.9. Let M be a compact n-manifold, let N ⊂ M be a subspace that is a compact manifold in its own right, let R be a ring and let A be an (R, Z[π])-bimodule. If R is Noetherian and if A is a finitely generated R-module, then all the twisted homology modules H * (M, N ; A) are finitely generated left R-modules.

In the proof of Proposition A.9 we will need the following lemma; cf. [Lam91, Proposition 1.21] or [Lan02a, Proposition X.1.4].

Lemma A.10. Let R be a Noetherian ring. If P is a finitely generated left R-module, then any submodule of P is also a finitely generated left R-module.

Proof of Proposition A.9. By Proposition A.5, there exists a chain complex C * of finite length consisting of finitely generated free left Z[π]-modules such that
H k (M, N ; A) ∼ = H k (A ⊗ Z[π] C * ).
Given k ∈ N 0 we denote the rank of C k as a free left Z[π]-module by r k . Then we have A ⊗ Z[π] C k ∼ = A ⊗ Z[π] Z[π] r k ∼ = A r k . In particular H k (M, N ; A) is isomorphic to a quotient of a submodule of a finitely generated R-module. The desired statement follows from Lemma A.10.

A.2. Cup and cap products on twisted (co-) chain complexes. Throughout this section let X be a connected topological space admitting a universal cover, and write π = π 1 (X). We want to introduce the cup product and the cap product on twisted (co-) chain complexes. Given an n-simplex σ, define the p-simplices σ p and σ p by σ p (t 0 , . . . , t p ) := σ(t 0 , . . . , t p , 0, . . . , 0), σ p (t 0 , . . . , t p ) := σ(0, . . . , 0, t 0 , . . . , t p ).

Given two right Z[π]-modules A and B we view A ⊗ Z B as a right Z[π]-module via the diagonal action of π.

First we introduce the cup product on twisted cohomology. The following lemma can be verified easily by hand, say along the lines of the proof of [Hat02, Lemma 3.6].

Lemma A.11. Let Y be a subset of X. We consider the map
Y : C p (X; A) × C q (X; B) −→ C p+q (X; A ⊗ Z B) (φ, ψ) −→ σ → ϕ(σ p ) ⊗ Z ψ(σ k−p ) .
(Note that the right-hand side is indeed Z[π]-homomorphism, i.e. it defines an element C p+q (X; A ⊗ Z B).) Furthermore the map descends to a well defined map
Y : H p (X, Y ; A) × H q (X, Y ; B) −→ H p+q (X, Y ; A ⊗ Z B).
We refer to this map as the cup product.

Next we introduce the cap product. As with cup product, first we define it on the chain level.

Lemma A.12. Let X be a topological space and let S, T ⊂ X be subsets. We write C k (X, {S, T }) = C k (X)/(C k (S) + C k (T )). The map
X : C p (X, S; A) × C k (X, {S, T }; A) −→ C k−p (X, T ; A ⊗ Z B) (ψ, b ⊗ Z[π] σ) −→ (ψ(σ p ) ⊗ Z b) ⊗ Z[π] σ k−p .
is well-defined. We refer to this map as the cap product.

Proof. We verify that the given map respects the tensor product. Thus let ψ ∈ C p (X; A), σ ∈ C k ( X), γ ∈ π and b ∈ B. We calculate that
ψ X b ⊗ Z[π] γσ = (ψ(γσ p ) ⊗ Z b) ⊗ Z[π] γσ k−p = (γψ(σ p ) ⊗ Z b) · γ ⊗ Z[π] σ k−p = (γ −1 γψ(σ p ) ⊗ Z bγ) ⊗ Z[π] σ k−p = ψ X bγ ⊗ Z[π] σ.
It follows easily from the definitions that the cap product descends to the given quotient (co-) chain complexes.

Lemma A.13. Let f ∈ C p (X; A) and let c ∈ C k (X; B). We have
∂(f X c) = (−1) p · (−δ(f ) X c + f X ∂c) ∈ C k−1 (X; A ⊗ Z B).
Proof. The lemma follows from a calculation using the definition of the cap product and the boundary maps, see e.g. [Fri19, Lemma 59.1] for details. Note that the precise signs differ from similar formulas in some textbooks in algebraic topology since there are many different sign conventions in usage.

Corollary A.14. Let X be a connected topological space, let S, T ⊂ X be subsets, let R be a ring and let A be an (R, Z[π 1 (M )])-bimodule. For any cycle σ ∈ C n (X, {S, T }; Z) the cap product X[σ] : H k (X, S; A) → H n−k (X, T ; A) = H n−k (X, T ; A ⊗ Z Z)

[ϕ] → [ϕ X σ]

is well-defined. Furthermore this map only depends on the homology class [σ] ∈ H n (X, S ∪ T ; Z).

A.3. The Poincaré duality theorem. The following theorem is a generalisation of the familiar Poincaré duality for untwisted coefficients to the case of twisted coefficients. defined by Lemma A.13 is an isomorphism of left R-modules.

We also have the following Poincaré Duality statement on the (co-) chain level. Note that Theorem 14.9 can be used to give an alternative proof that the chain complexes of the theorem are chain homotopy equivalent. a ⊗ f → (σ → a · f (σ)).

Note that Ξ is an isomorphism if each D k is a finitely generated free Z[π]-module. But in general Ξ is not an isomorphism. Furthermore we consider the following diagram One easily verifies that the diagram commutes. The top horizontal map is an isomorphism by the Universal Poincaré Duality Theorem A.16. It remains to show that the vertical map is an isomorphism. As we had pointed out above, on the chain level Ξ is in general not an isomorphism.

As in the proof of Proposition A.5 we can use Theorem 4.5 to find a pair (X, Y ) of finite CW-complexes and a homotopy equivalence One easily verifies that the diagram commutes. As pointed out above, the horizontal maps are chain homotopy equivalences over Z [π]. Since X is a finite CW-complex we see that each C cell k (X, Y ; Z[π]) is a finitely generated free Z[π]-module. Thus we obtain from the above that the left vertical map is an isomorphism. Therefore we see that the right vertical map is a chain homotopy equivalence. In particular it induces an isomorphism of homology groups.

The remainder of this appendix is dedicated to the proof of the Twisted Poincaré Duality Theorem A.15. Even though the theorem is well-known and often used, there are not many satisfactory proofs in the literature. The proof which is closest to ours in spirit is the proof of Sun [Sun17]. For closed manifolds Kwasik-Sun [KS18] provide a proof by using the work of Kirby-Siebenmann to reduce the proof to the case of triangulated manifolds.

The proof of the Twisted Poincaré Duality Theorem A.15 is modelled on the proof of untwisted Poincaré Duality that is given in Bredon's book [Bre97, Chapter VI Section 8]. The logic of his proof is unchanged, but some arguments and definitions have to be adjusted for the twisted setting.

A.4. Preparations for the proof of the Twisted Poincaré Duality Theorem A.15. We fix some notation that we will use for the remainder of this appendix. Let M be a connected manifold and denote by π := π 1 (M, x 0 ) the fundamental group. Finally let R be a ring and let A be an (R, Z[π])-bimodule.

We write p : M → M for the universal cover of M . For a subset X ⊂ M (not necessarily connected) we consider the (co)-homology of X with respect to the coefficient system coming from M by setting We summarise the basic properties of twisted coefficients in the following theorem, which should be compared to the untwisted case. twisted coefficients only for inclusions and hence a homotopy inverse does not fit in our theory. Therefore statement (4) will be deduced in a slightly round-about way using the following elementary lemma [Bre97, Chapter III Theorem 3.4 & remark after proof]. ) is the free abelian group generated by simplices σ for which there is a U ∈ U such that σ : ∆ * → p −1 (U ). This is done by defining the barycentric subdivision Υ * : C * ( X; Z) → C * ( X; Z) and a chain homotopy T between Υ * and the identity [Bre97, Lemma 17.1]. The important thing for us to observe is that both maps are natural [Bre97,Claim (1)  The same holds for T and from now on one can follow the classical proofs. Alternatively, one could invoke Lemma A.4.

Next we prove statement (4). Let f : X → Y ⊂ X be a homotopy inverse of the inclusion and H : X × I → X a homotopy between Id X and f . Since p : X → X is a covering and Id X is a lift of H(p(−), 0), we get by Lemma A.4 a lift H : X × I → X of the homotopy H. One easily verifies that the inclusion Y → X induces a homotopy equivalence where a homotopy inverse is given by H(−, 1). Hence the inclusion induced map H k (C * ( Y ; Z)) → H k (C * ( X; Z)) is an isomorphism for every k. Thus the claim follows from Lemma A.4.

The proof of Statement (5) is almost verbatim the same proof as in the classical case.

A.5. The main technical theorem regarding Poincaré Duality. Given a group π we can view Z as a Z[π]-module with trivial π-action. We denote this module by Z triv . Let p : M → M be the covering projection. We have the following useful lemma, concerning the chain map C * (X; Z triv ) → C * (X; Z) defined by k ⊗ Z[π] σ → k · p(σ).

Lemma A.19. Given any subset X ⊂ M the chain map above is an isomorphism between C * (X; Z triv ) and C * (X; Z), and induces one between C * (X; Z) and C * (X; Z triv ), where C * (X; Z) and C * (X; Z) are the untwisted singular chain complexes.

Proof. The isomorphism is given by lifting a simplex, which is always possible since a simplex is simply connected. If one has two different choices of lifts, then they differ by an element in π. But the action of Z[π] on Z is trivial and hence this indeterminacy vanishes.

We will keep the notational difference between C * (X; Z) and C * (X; Z triv ) to emphasise where our simplices live.

As above let R be a ring and let A is an (R, Z[π])-bimodule. Let K ⊂ M be a compact subset of M . We define the (twisted) Cech cohomology groupš Given another open set V ⊂ U denote by i : V → U the inclusion. Then one easily calculates:

PD V (i * φ) = j * i * (i * φ X ex V (θ K )) = j * (φ X i * ex V (θ K )) = j * (φ X ex U (θ K )) = PD U (φ).

Or, with other words, the following diagram commutes: In the remainder of this section we will prove the following theorem. Here, as above, A is an (R, Z[π])-bimodule. In the subsequent section we will see that the Twisted Poincaré Duality Theorem A.15 is a reasonably straightforward consequence of Theorem A.20.

The proof of Theorem A.20 will be an application of the following lemma.

Lemma A.21 (Bootstrap lemma). Let P M (K) be a statement about compact sets K in M . If P M (·) satisfies the following three conditions:

(1) P M (K) holds true for all compact subsets K ⊂ M with the property that for all x ∈ K the inclusions {x} → K and M \ K → M \ {x} are deformation retracts, (2) If P M (K 1 ), P M (K 2 ) and P M (K 1 ∩ K 2 ) is true, then P M (K 1 ∪ K 2 ) is true, (3) If · · · ⊂ K 2 ⊂ K 1 and P M (K i ) is true for all i ∈ N, then P M ( i∈N K i ) is true.

Then P M (K) is true for all K ⊂ M .

Proof. See [Bre97, Chapter VI Lemma 7.9].

The idea is to apply the bootstrap lemma to the statements that the conclusion of Theorem A.20 holds for a given compact set K. It turns out that condition (3) is the easiest to verify. It follows from formal properties about direct limits. For the verification of condition (1) we have do to one explicit calculation. This is the content of the next lemma. (1) U is contractible, (2) for any connected component U ⊂ p −1 (U ) the map p| U is a homeomorphism.

This can be done, since any neighbourhood of x contains a neighbourhood with these two properties. Let U be such a neighbourhood of x and U ⊂ p −1 (U ) a fixed connected component. This choice of connected component gives us an isomorphism H 0 (U ; A) ∼ = A as follows. Let f ∈ H 0 (U ; A) be arbitrary and x ∈ U be a point in our connected component, then we get an element in A by evaluating f ([x]). Conversely, given an element e ∈ A we can construct a function in H 0 (U ; A) by setting f ([x]) = e for all x ∈ U . Note that there is a unique way to extend f equivariantly to C 0 (p −1 (U ); Z).

We are now going to construct a representative of the orientation class θ K ∈ H n (M, M \ {x} ; Z triv ) for which it is very simple to calculate the dualising map. Let x be the preimage of x in U . Now take a cycle d i=1 k i σ i which generates H n (U , U \ {x} ; Z). By excision and Lemma A.19 one easily sees that 1 ⊗ Z[π] d i=1 k i σ i . This is clearly an isomorphism, since on the Obviously e does not play a role since we kill it in the end. With these representatives one computes that δ(φ)(θ) is represented by
h X (b + c + d) = δ(f ) ∩ c + h X d + δ(f ) ∩ b = δ(f ) ∩ c.
The pairing of h with b is zero since f was a cocycle in C * (U ∩ V ; A) and the pairing of h with d is zero since d consist of simplices with image in V .

The lower sequence comes from the short exact sequence: Before we compute the other side ∂(φ X ex U ∩V (θ)) we want to recall that the cap product is natural on the chain complex level i.e. the following diagram commutes: ∂(f X a) = (−1) p+1 · δ(f ) X a ± f X ∂a (by Lemma A.13) = (−1) p+1 · δ(f ) X a (since f X ∂a ∈ C n−p−1 (M \ (K ∪ L); A)) = (−1) p+1 · δ(f ) X b + c + d + e = (−1) p+1 · δ(f ) X (c + d) (same reason as above) = (−1) p+1 · δ(f ) X c (since d ∈ C n−p (V \ (K ∩ V ); A)) Therefore the element ∂(φXex U ∩V (θ)) is also represented by (−1) p+1 ·δ(f )Xc ∈ C n−p−1 (M, M \ (K ∪ L); A).

Proof of Theorem A.20. Let P M (K) be the statement that the map PD K is an isomorphism. Then it is sufficient to verify condition (1),(2) and (3) of the bootstrap lemma. We start with verifying (1). In the case that K = {x} is just a point we have already seen in Lemma A.22 that the statement holds true. For a general compact K with the property of (1) the statement follows from the following commutative diagram:

2Definition 6.2. A map f : X → M from a k-manifold to an m-manifold M is called a (proper) locally flat embedding if f is a homeomorphism onto its image and if the image is a (proper) submanifold of M . Given any submanifold X of M , the inclusion map X → M is a locally flat embedding. Conversely, if f : X → M is a locally flat embedding, then the image f (X) is a submanifold. Remark 6.3. (1) Note that if M is a k-manifold and U is an open subset of R k , then it follows from the invariance of domain that the image any injective map f : U → M is an open subset of M . In particular f (U ) is a submanifold of M . Put differently, f is locally flat.

2The Kirby-Siebenmann invariant and stable smoothing of 4-manifolds. The formulation of the other two statements on smoothing 4-manifolds make use of the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant. The Kirby-Siebenmann invariant ks(M ) ∈ Z/2 of a compact 4manifold is defined in [FQ90, Section 10.2B], or alternatively by [KS77, p. 318] or [Rud16, Definition 3.4.2], and we describe the construction now. The homotopy fibre TOP / PL of the forgetful map BPL → BTOP has the homotopy type of a K(Z/2, 3) and has the structure of a loop space, permitting the definition of the delooping B(TOP / PL) [BV68, Theorem C], [BV73] which is an Eilenberg-Maclane space of type K(Z/2, 4). A connected topological 4-manifold has a unique smooth structure on its boundary. Using the homotopy fibre sequence TOP / PL → BPL → BTOP → B(TOP / PL), the unique obstruction to a lift of the classifying map τ M : M → BTOP of the stable tangent microbundle to BPL is therefore a homotopy class in [(M, ∂M ), (B(TOP / PL) =K(Z/2,4) , * )] ∼ = H 4 (M, ∂M ; Z/2) = Z/2.

the tangent microbundle of M and ε denotes a rank one trivial vector bundle over M . If M × R admits a smooth structure, then there is a lift τ Diff M ×R : M → BO(5), the smooth tangent bundle to M × R. Let p : BO(5) → BTOP(5) be the canonical map. Then


more easily. To see this observe that a disjoint union M N is cobordant to M #N via the cobordism (M × I N × I) ∪ S 0 ×D 4 (D 1 × D 4 ), with {−1}×D 4 embedded in the interior of M ×{1}, and {1}×D 4 embedded in the interior of N × {1}. Then by (3) the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant vanishes on M #N M N and therefore ks(M #N ) = ks(M ) + ks(N ) ∈ Z/2. Let us prove (3). Suppose that a compact 4-manifold M is the boundary of a compact 5-manifold W . Perform 0 and 1-surgeries on W to obtain a path connected, simply connected, compact 5-manifold with ∂W = M . Note that H 4 (W, ∂W ; Z/2) ∼ = H 1 (W ; Z/2) = 0 since W is simply connected, so [(W, ∂W ), (B(TOP / PL), * )] ∼ = H 4 (W, ∂W ; Z/2) = 0. It follows from the homotopy fibre sequence associated to BTOP → BPL that the classifying map in [W, BTOP] of the stable tangent microbundle lifts to a map in [W, BPL]. Therefore there is a lift W → BPL of the stable tangent microbundle. The restriction M → W → BTOP equals the stable tangent microbundle of M , since M has a collar M × [0, 1] ⊂ W . It follows that the composition M → W → BPL is a stable lift of τ M , so that ks(M ) = 0.

## Theorem 8. 3 .
3If M is a compact, connected 4-manifold with vanishing Kirby-Siebenmann invariant, then M × R admits a smooth structure. Proof. The vanishing of the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant implies that there is a lift of τ M : M → BTOP to a map M → BPL. Since PL /O is 6-connected [FQ90, Theorem 8.3B], [HM74, Proof of 4.13], there is in fact a lift τ M : M → BO. This corresponds to a lift τ M ⊕ ε n : M → BO(4 + n), for some n. This in turn corresponds to a lift τ M ×R n : M × R n → BO(4 + n) of the tangent microbundle τ M ×R n : M × R n → BTOP. By [KS77, Essay V, Theorem 1.4], there exists a corresponding smooth structure on M × R n . Then apply the Product Structure Theorem 5.16 [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.1], to deduce the existence of a smooth structure on M × R, using that the dimension of M × R is at least five.Example 8.4. Here is an application of Theorem 8.3. By the classification of simply connected, closed 4-manifolds [FQ90, Section 10.1] (see also our Theorem 11.2), there is a simply connected, closed spin 4-manifold N with intersection form E 8 ⊕ E 8 . Since this form is not diagonalisable over Z, by Donaldson's theorem[Don83] (Theorem 3.7) this 4-manifold does not admit a smooth structure. However the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant of N vanishes, since for a closed 4-manifold M with even intersection form, the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant ks(M ) coincides with σ(M )/8 mod 2, and E 8 ⊕ E 8 is rank 16 and positive definite, with signature 16. Therefore N × R admits a smooth structure by Theorem 8.3, even though N does not.Construction 8.5. Here is a construction of the Chern manifold * CP 2 . This manifold was first constructed in[Fre82, p. 370]. Attach a 2-handle D 2 × D 2 to D 4 by identifying S 1 × D 2 with a +1-framed trefoil in ∂D 4 = S 3 . The boundary of the resulting manifold is an integral homology sphere. Freedman proved that every integral homology sphere bounds a contractible 4-manifold [Fre82, Theorem 1.4 ], [FQ90, Corollary 9.3C]. Cap off D 4 ∪ D 2 × D 2 with this contractible 4-manifold, to obtain the closed 4-manifold * CP 2 . By the Rochlin invariant, every compact, smooth, spin 4-manifold with boundary +1-surgery

Pick normal disc bundles D(S) and D(T ), and remove the interiors of (T ) i.e. smaller disc bundles inside the normal disc bundles. We obtain a manifold with boundary X := M \ Int 1 2 D(S) ∪ Int 1 2 D(T ) together with a collar neighbourhood of the boundary arising from D(S) \ Int 1 2 D(S), and the same with T replacing S, extended using Theorem 2.5 to a collar neighbourhood for all of ∂X. Choose a closed disc neighbourhood E S of P in S. We write ∂ S X for the fibrewise boundary of 1 2 D(S), ∂ T X for the fibrewise boundary of 1 2 D(T ), and ∂ 1 X for

Use Theorem 2.5 to extend this collar neighbourhood to a collar neighbourhood over all of ∂X.We now have two collar neighbourhoods of ∂X, the collar Ψ 1 : ∂X × [0, 1] → X we have just constructed which is compatible with N (C X ), and the collar neighbourhood Ψ 2 : ∂X × [0, 1] → X constructed above from D(S) 2.7, there is an isotopy H t : M → M starting from the identity, such that H 1 • Ψ 1 = Ψ 2 , i.e. sends the first collar to the second.

## Theorem 10 . 8 .
108Let Y ⊂ N be a proper submanifold with normal microbundle νY . Let f : M → N be a map, and let U be a neighbourhood of the setgraph f ∩ (M × Y ) ⊂ M × N.Then there exists a homotopy F :M × I → N such that (1) F (m, 0) = f (m) for all m ∈ M ; (2) F 1 : m → F (m, 1) is transverse to νY ; and (3) for m ∈ M either (a) (m, f (m)) / ∈ U , in which case F (m, t) = f (m) for all t ∈ I, or (b) (m, f (m)) ∈ U , in which case (m,F (m, t)) ∈ U for all t ∈ I.Proof. Note that M × Y ⊂ M × N is a proper submanifold with normal microbundle M × νY = pr * Y νY . Also graph f is a proper submanifold of M × N . By Theorem 10.3, there exists an isotopy G : graph f × I → M × N, supported in U , of the submanifold graph f to a submanifold T ⊂ M × N such that T is transverse to M × νY over M × Y .

Consider the 4-manifold X := D 4 \ νF .In the boundary of X we have the surface B = S ∪ F × {1}. It follows from the long exact sequence of the pair (X, ∂X) and Poincaré duality that the map H 3 (X, ∂X; Z) → H 2 (∂X; Z) is an epimorphism. It follows from Theorem 10.9, applied to A = ∂X, that there exists a 3-dimensional submanifold Y of D 4 \νF with ∂Y = B. This statement is folklore, and a proof using topological transversality for maps was recently written down by Lewark-McCoy[LM15].

## First proof of Theorem 10. 9 .
9Let M be a compact orientable connected 4-manifold and let A be a union of components of ∂M . Let k = 2 or k = 3 and let σ ∈ H k (X, A; Z).Pick a point P ∈ M \ ∂M and pick an open ball B ⊂ M \ ∂M containing P . It follows from a Mayer-Vietoris argument applied to M = (M \ {P }) ∪ B that the inclusion induced map H k (M \ {P }, A) → H k (M, A) is an isomorphism for k = 2, 3. Now let σ ∈ H k (M, A). By the previous paragraph we can view σ as an element in H k (M \ {P }, A). By Theorem 8.1 the manifold M \ {P } is smooth. There exists a compact subset K of M \ {P } such that σ lies in the image of H k (K, A) → H k (M \ {P }, A), since one can take the union of the images of the singular simplices in a singular chain representing σ. By Lemma 10.13, there exists a compact 4-dimensional smooth submanifold X of M \ {P } that contains the compact set K ∪ ∂M . Note that A is again a union of components of ∂X. The desired statement of Theorem 10.9 is now an immediate consequence of Proposition 10.11 (1), with σ the image of σ ∈ H k (K, A) under the inclusion induced map to H k (X, A).


maps the Thom class τ of νS to the fundamental class i[S]. Proof. Recall that the Poincaré duality map PD X is just X[X], capping with the fundamental class. The composition of the last two maps factors through i : H k (S; Z) → H k (X; Z) by Poincaré-Lefschetz duality [Bre97, Corollary 8.4]. Recall that the fundamental class [S] ∈ H k (S, ∂S; Z) of the submanifold S is characterised by the property that for all x ∈ S the class [S] is sent to the positive generator of H k (S, S \ {x}; Z) ∼ = Z.


Then there exists a closed, simply connected, oriented 4-manifold M with H 2 (M ; Z) ∼ = F , with intersection form isometric to θ and with Kirby-Siebenmann invariant equal to k. Let M and M be two closed, simply connected, oriented 4-manifolds and let φ : H 2 (M ; Z) ∼ = − → H 2 (M ; Z) be an isometry of the intersection forms. Suppose that ks(M ) = ks(M ). Then there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism M ∼ = − → M inducing φ on second homology. This homeomorphism is unique up to isotopy.

## Definition 11. 5 .
5Two homeomorphisms h 0 , h 1 : M → N are pseudo-isotopic if there is a homeomorphism H : M × I → N × I with H| M ×{i} = h i : M × {i} → N × {i} for i = 0, 1.


Then there exists a closed, oriented 4-manifold M with π 1 (M ) ∼ = Z, with H 2 (M ; Z[Z]) isomorphic to F , whose equivariant intersection form λ M : H 2 (M ; Z[Z]) × H 2 (M ; Z[Z]) → Z[Z] is isometric to θ, and with ks(M ) = k. Let M and M be two closed, oriented 4-manifolds with π 1 (M ) ∼ = Z ∼ = π 1 (M ) and let φ : H 2 (M ; Z[Z]) ∼ = − → H 2 (M ; Z[Z]) be an isometry of the equivariant intersection forms. Suppose that ks(M ) = ks(M ). Then there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism M ∼ = − → M inducing φ on Z[Z] coefficient second homology. This homeomorphism is unique up to pseudo-isotopy if θ is even, and if θ is odd there are exactly two pseudo-isotopy classes.

Let B(k) be a solvable Baumslag-Solitar group and let M and N be closed, oriented 4-manifolds with fundamental group isomorphic to B(k). Suppose that there is an isomorphism φ : H 2 (M ; Z[B(k)]) → H 2 (N ; Z[B(k)]) of Z[B(k)]-modules such that: (1) The map φ induces an isometry between the intersection form λ : H 2 (M ; Z[B(k)]) × H 2 (M ; Z[B(k)]) → Z[B(k)] and the corresponding intersection form on H 2 (N ; Z[B(k)]). (2) The Kirby-Siebenmann invariants agree ks(M ) = ks(N ). (3) The w 2 -types of M and N coincide. Then M and N are homeomorphic via an orientation preserving homeomorphism that induces φ : H 2 (M ; Z[B(k)]) → H 2 (N ; Z[B(k)]).

Then M and N are homeomorphic via an orientation preserving homeomorphism that induces φ : FH 2 (M ; Z) → FH 2 (N ; Z).

Then ξ : B = Bπ × BTOPSpin → BTOP is the normal 1-type of M , with B as in the spin case, but the map ξ twisted using a complex line bundle on Bπ defined in terms of w 2 (M ). For more details on these assertions, see [KLPT17, Sections 2 and 3]. Here is the relevant theorem of Kreck, which relates bordism over the normal 1-type to stable diffeomorphism. Theorem 12.11. Two closed, connected, smooth 4-manifolds M and N with χ(M ) = χ(N ) and fibre homotopy equivalent normal 1-types are stably diffeomorphic if and only if [(M, ν M )] = [(N, ν N )] ∈ Ω 4 (B, ξ) for some choices of normal 1-smoothings ν M and ν N .

Aside from H 0 (Bπ; Ω S 4 ), there is one other potentially infinite term on the E ∞ page, namely the subgroup of H 4 (Bπ; Ω S 0 ) arising as the kernel of relevant differentials.

## Theorem 12 . 16 .
1216Let M and N be closed, connected, nonorientable, smooth 4-manifolds M and N . Suppose that M and N are homeomorphic. If w 2 ( M ) = 0 = w 2 ( N ), that is the universal covers of M and N are not spin, then M and N are stably diffeomorphic. Here is the normal 1-type for nonorientable manifolds with a certain w 2 -type [Tei92, Chapter 2]. Lemma 12.17. Let M be a nonorientable closed, connected smooth 4-manifold with w 2 ( M ) = 0. Then the normal 1-type of M is ξ : B = Bπ × BSO → BO with the map ξ = w 1 ⊕ Bi given by the Whitney sum of a bundle on Bπ determined by w 1 : π → Z/2 and the canonical map Bi : BSO → BO induced by the inclusion i : SO → O. Lemma 12.18. Let M be a nonorientable closed, connected 4-manifold with w 2 ( M ) = 0. Then the normal 1-type of M is ξ : B = Bπ × BSTOP → BTOP with the map ξ = w 1 ⊕ Bi given by the Whitney sum of a bundle on Bπ determined by the orientation character w 1 : π → Z/2 and the canonical map Bi : BSTOP → BTOP induced by the inclusion i : STOP → TOP.

## Theorem 13 . 1 .
131Let M be a closed oriented 4-manifold. (1) For every finite cover p : M → M we have σ( M ) = [ M : M ] · σ(M ). (2) For every unitary representation α : π 1 (M ) → U (k) we have σ(M, α) = k · σ(M ). (3) For every group homomorphism γ : π 1 (M ) → Γ we have σ (2) (M, γ) = σ(M ). Remark 13.2. (1) The same statement does not hold for 4-dimensional Poincaré complexes in general. More precisely, Wall [Wal67, Corollary 5.4.1] gave examples of 4-dimensional Poincaré complexes for which the signature is not multiplicative under finite covers. (2) Alternative proofs for the first statement and the third statement are provided by Schafer [Sch70, Theorem 8] and Lück-Schick [LS03, Theorem 0.2]. In fact these papers are also valid for manifolds of any dimension 4m.

the union of M with an external open collar ∂M × [0, 1) of its boundary. Write M := M ∪ ∂M ∂M × [0, 1). Embed M into R n as in the closed case [Hat02, Corollary A.9]. Note that M has empty boundary and so it is properly embedded. As in the closed case, obtain a disc bundle B(M ) and let B(M ) be the restriction of this disc bundle to M . Now we have to take much more care. Note that ∂B(M ) decomposes as ∂B(M ) = B(∂M ) ∪ X B ∂ (M ). Here B ∂ (M ) denotes the fibrewise boundary and X = ∂ B(∂M ) denotes the intersection of B(∂M ) and B ∂ (M ). As above, we will find a PL structure σ ∂ of R n such that each subset B(∂M ), X and B ∂ (M ) is PL-submanifold of R n .

## Definition 14. 4 .
4The simple homotopy type of a compact connected n-manifold M is given by (M, s), where s : M → D(M ) is the inclusion of the 0-section. The simple homotopy type of the pair (M, ∂M ) is given by the square where D(∂M ) ⊂ D(M ) are the disc bundles from Construction 14.3, with CW structures arising from a choice of PL triangulations corresponding to the PL structures. By the commutative square at the end of Construction 14.3, the simple homotopy type of (M, ∂M ) is well-defined. Here we use that PL isomorphisms are simple: for any choice of triangulations underpinning the PL structures, the resulting homeomorphism is a simple homotopy equivalence. Also stabilising by D s does not change the simple homotopy type, since as PL manifolds D s ∼ = D s−1 × [−1, 1], and D s−1 × {0} → D s−1 × [−1, 1] is a simple equivalence.

## ( 2 )
2The restrictions of f to the pairs (M, ∂M ), (∂M, R ± ) and (R ± , R − ∩ R + ) give the simple homotopy types of these pairs of manifolds, as defined in the previous section.

## Assumption 14 . 10 .

## ( 3 )
3For any finitely generated Z[H]-module A we have ord(A) = ord(A). (4) For any finitely generated torsion Z[H]-module A we have ord(Ext 1 Z[H] (A, Z[H])) = ord(A).

## First
proof of the Fox-Milnor theorem 15.2. In this proof we abbreviate Λ := Z[t ±1 ]. We start out with the following three observations.(a) We have H 0 (W D ; Λ) ∼ = H 0 (N K ; Λ) ∼ = Λ/(t − 1). (b) We have H 0 (W D , N K ; Λ) = 0,(c)By Proposition 15.5 and Proposition 15.4 we know that for all k Ext 0 Λ (H k (W D , N K ; Λ), Λ) = Hom Λ (H k (W D , N K ; Λ), Λ) = 0. Claim. For any i ∈ N we have H i (N K ; Λ) ∼ = Ext 1 Λ (H 2−i (N K ; Λ), Λ) H i (W D ; Λ) ∼ = Ext 1 Λ (H 3−i (W D , N K ; Λ), Λ).

## Theorem A. 15 (
15Twisted Poincaré duality). Let M an compact, oriented, connected ndimensional manifold. Let S and T be codimension 0 compact submanifolds of ∂M such that ∂S = ∂T = S ∩ T and ∂M = S ∪ T . Let [M ] ∈ H n (M, ∂M ; Z) be the fundamental class of M . If R is a ring and if A is an (R, Z[π 1 (M )])-bimodule, then the map − X [M ] : H k (M, S; A) → H n−k (M, T ; A)

## Theorem A. 16 (
16Universal Poincaré duality). Let M an compact, oriented, connected ndimensional manifold. Let S and T be codimension 0 compact submanifolds of ∂M such that ∂S = ∂T = S ∩ T and ∂M = S ∪ T . Let σ ∈ C n (M, {S, T }; Z) be a representative of the fundamental class of M . If R is a ring and if A is an (R, Z[π 1 (M )])-bimodule, then the map − X σ : C k (M, ∂M ; Z[π 1 (M )]) → C n−k (M ; Z[π 1 (M )]) defined by Lemma A.13 is a chain homotopy equivalence of left R-chain complexes.


Proof. The Universal Poincaré Duality Theorem A.16 follows immediately from the Twisted Poincaré Duality Theorem A.15 together with Lemma A.4. Below we will provide a proof of the Twisted Poincaré Duality Theorem A.15. But just for fun we would like to show that the Universal Poincaré Duality Theorem A.16 also implies the Twisted Poincaré Duality Theorem A.15. Proof of Theorem A.15 using Theorem A.16. Let M be an compact, oriented, connected n-dimensional manifold. We pick a representative σ for [M ] and we write π = π 1 (M ). Let A be an (R, Z[π])-bimodule. Given a chain complex D * of right Z[π]-modules we consider the cochain map Ξ : A ⊗ Z[π] Hom right-Z[π] (D * ; Z[π])) → Hom right-Z[π] (D * , A)

## H
k (A ⊗ Z[π] C * (M, ∂M ; Z[π])) −k (A ⊗ Z[π] C * (M ; Z[π])) = H n−k (M ; A) H k (C * (M, ∂M ; A)) = H k (M, ∂M ; A).

## //
f : (X, Y ) → (M, ∂M ). By Proposition A.3 there exists a homotopy equivalence Θ :C cell * (X, Y ; Z[π]) → C * (X, Y ; Z[π]) of Z[π]-chaincomplexes. We consider the following diagram where all tensor products and homomorphism are over Z[π]:A ⊗ C * cell (X, Y ; Z[π]) Ξ * Θ * / / A ⊗ C * (X, Y ; / A ⊗ C * (M, ∂M ; / C * (X, Y ; A) f * / / C * (M, ∂M ; A).

## C
* (X; A) := A ⊗ Z[π] C * (p −1 (X); Z), C * (X; A) := Hom Z[π] C * (p −1 (X); Z), A , with generalisation to pairs Y ⊂ X ⊂ M by C * (X, Y ; A) := A ⊗ Z[π] C * (p −1 (X), p −1 (Y ); Z), C * (X, Y ; A) := Hom Z[π] C * (p −1 (X), p −1 (Y ); Z), A .


Lemma A.18 (The Covering Homotopy Theorem). Given a covering p : X → X, a homotopy H : Y × I → X, and a lift h : Y → X of H(−, 0), there exists a unique lift H : Y × I → X of H with h = H(−, 0). Proof of Theorem A.17. Recall that p : M → M denotes the universal cover.For statement (1) we consider the short exact sequence 0→ C * (Y ; Z[π]) → C * (X; Z[π]) → C * (X, Y ; Z[π]) → 0 of free Z[π]-modules. Since the modules are free the sequence stays exact after applying the functors A ⊗ Z[π] − and Hom Z[π] (−, A). Recall the proof of statement (2) and (3) in the classical case as it is done for example in Bredon's book [Bre97, Chapter IV Section 17]. The main ingredient is to show that the inclusion of chain complexes C U * (X; Z[π]) → C * (X; Z[π]) induces an isomorphism on homology [Bre97, Theorem 17.7]. Here U is an open cover of X and C U * (X; Z[π]


in proof of Lemma 17.1]. Hence for a twisted chain Υ(e ⊗ Z[π] σ) := e ⊗ Z[π] Υ(σ) is well-defined, because Υ(e ⊗ Z[π] γσ) = e ⊗ Z[π] Υ(γσ) = e ⊗ Z[π] γΥ(σ) (naturality of Υ) = eγ ⊗ Z[π] Υ(σ) = Υ(eγ ⊗ Z[π] σ)


direct limit runs over all open sets in M containing K. Since cohomology is contravariant, we define the order on open sets in the reversed way i.e. U ≤ V if V ⊂ U . Now we assume that M is oriented. Being oriented gives us for any closed subset Z ⊂ M a preferred element θ Z ∈ H n (M, M \ Z; Z triv ) ∼ = H n (M, M \ Z; Z), which restricts for all x ∈ Z to the generator in H n (M, M \ {x} ; Z triv ). For any open set U ⊂ M containing K let ex U : H n (M, M \K; Z triv ) → H n (U, U \K; Z triv ) be the inverse of the inclusion given by the excision isomorphism i.e. if j : U → M is the inclusion then j * • ex U = Id. We then obtain a map D U : H p (U ; A) −→ H n (M, M \ K; A)φ −→ j * (φ X ex U (θ K )).


By the universal property of the direct limit we obtain the dualising map PD K :Ȟ p (K; A) → H n−p (M, M \ K; A).

## Theorem A. 20 (
20Poincaré duality). The map PD K :Ȟ p (K; A) → H n−p (M, M \ K; A) is a left R-module isomorphism for all compact subsets K ⊂ M .

## Lemma A. 22 .
22Let x ∈ M be a point. The map PD {x} :Ȟ 0 ({x} ; A) → H n (M, M \ {x} ; A) is an R-module isomorphism. Proof. Let p : M → M be the universal cover. Since x is a point in a manifold we can calculate the dualising map PD {x} by taking the limit over open neighbourhoods U of x with the following two properties:


d i=1 k i σ i is a generator of H n (M, M \ {x} ; Z triv ). Using the isomorphism H 0 (U ; A) ∼ = A from above the dualising map becomes PD {x} : A → H n (M, M \ {x} ; A), e → e ⊗ Z[π]

To construct the boundary map ∂, we take as the preimage of f X a ∈ C* (M, M \ (K ∩ L); A) the element (f X a, 0) ∈ C * (M, M \ K; A) ⊕ C * (M, M \ L; A). Then one computes in C * (M, M \ K; A)

Since a CW complex is finite if and only if it is compact we have shown (1). For M an n-manifold with boundary, Kirby-Siebenmann [KS77, Essay III.2, Theorem 2.1] showed for n ≥ 6 that M has a topological handlebody structure rel. ∂M ×I. Quinn [Qui82, Theorem 2.3.1] extended this result to n = 5. Kirby-Siebenmann [KS77, Essay III.2, Theorem 2.2] then says that M is homeomorphic to the mapping cylinder of some map f : ∂M → X, where X is a finite CW complex. Thus (2) holds.

## ) .
)Remark 4.9. Let M be a compact, connected manifold. Borsuk's theorem that M is a Euclidean Neighbourhood Retract shows that M is a retract of a finite CW complex; see [Hat02, Appendix A, Corollary A.9], [Bre97, Appendix E], and [Fri19, Proposition 65.22].This fact is nontrivial but it is much easier to prove than Theorem 4.5. Borsuk's Theorem implies immediately that the homology groups of M are finitely generated and that the fundamental group of M is finitely generated. In fact using a group theoretic lemma asin [Wal65, Lemma 1.3] or alternatively [FR01, Theorem 3.1], one actually obtains that 
π 1 (M ) is finitely presented. But it is not clear how Borsuk's Theorem can be used to prove 
Corollary 4.8 (3). 




otherwise. Note that the collar neighborhood ∂M × [0, 1] is of the desired form for the proper submanifold h 1 (X). By the Isotopy Extension Theorem 2.10 we can extend h to a isotopy H of M . Thus H −1 1 (∂M × [0, 1]) is the desired collar neighborhood for M .

8.1. Smoothing non-compact 4-manifolds. The first of our smoothing theorems [Qui82, Corollary 2.2.3], [FQ90, p. 116] says that noncompact connected 4-manifolds admit a smooth structure.


[Las71, p. 156] proved the smooth version of [KS77, Essay V, Addendum 1.4.1], or one can use PL smoothing theory [HM74], [FQ90, Theorem 8.3B] to improve a PL structure from [KS77, Essay V, Addendum 1.4.1] to a smooth structure, essentially uniquely. Freedman only applies smoothing theory in cases, such as for contractible M , that he can ensure the existence of a lift of τ M : M → BTOP(4) to BO(4). Later, Quinn [Qui82, Corollary 2.2.3] showed that such a lift always exists for connected noncompact 4-manifolds. In fact, he showed that the map TOP(4

11.2. Non simply connected 4-manifolds. First, we present a classification result[FQ90,  Theorem 10.7A] for closed, oriented 4-manifolds with fundamental group Z which is quite similar to Theorem 11.2. To state the theorem we need some extra definitions.Definition 11.4. For a finitely generated free Z[Z] module F , a hermitian sesquilinear 
form θ : F × F → Z[Z] is called even if there is a left Z[Z]-module homomorphism q : F → 
Hom Z[Z] (F, Z[Z]) with q + q  *  : F → Hom Z[Z] (F, Z[Z]) equal to the adjoint of θ. Otherwise 
we call the form odd.

A straightforward calculation shows that H * (S 1 , pt; Q) = 0. It follows that H * (W D , pt;


Definition 15.6. Let H be a finitely generated free abelian group and let M be a finitely generated Z[H]-module. By [Lan02a, Corollary IV.9.5] the ring Z[H] is Noetherian which implies that M admits a free resolution Z[H] r ·A − → Z[H] s → M → 0. Without loss of generality we can assume that r > s. Since Z[H] is unique factorisation domain, see [Lan02a, Lemma IV.2.3], the order ord(M ) is defined as the greatest common divisor of the s × s-minors of A. By [Tur01, Lemma 4.4] the order is well-defined, i.e. independent of the choice of the free resolution, up to multiplication by a unit in Z[H].


for every prime element p, by (iv). On the other hand, again for each prime element p, we have ord(A) .= Z[H] (p) ord(Z[H] (p) ⊗ Z[H] A) by (iii). Combining these two observations yields ord(A) . = Z[H] (p) ord(Ext 1 Z[H] (p) (Z[H] (p) ⊗ Z[H] A, Z[H] (p) )). By the second part of (iii) we have thatord(Ext 1 Z[H] (p) (Z[H] (p) ⊗ Z[H] A, Z[H] (p) )) . = Z[H] (p) ord(Z[H] (p) ⊗ Z[H] Ext 1 Z[H] (A, Z[H])). By the first part of (iii) again we have ord(Z[H] (p) ⊗ Z[H] Ext 1 Z[H] (A, Z[H])) . = Z[H] (p) ord(Ext 1 Z[H] (A, Z[H])). Thus combining the last three equalities we have ord(A) . = Z[H] (p) ord(Ext 1 Z[H] (A, Z[H])) for all prime elements p. Now (4) follows by applying (vi).

Acknowledgments. Thanks to Steve Boyer, Anthony Conway, Jim Davis, Fabian Hebe-Proof. Statement (1) is proved for H ∼ = Z in[Lev67,Lemma 5]. The general case follows from[Hil12,Theorem 3.12]. Note that (2) is an immediate consequence of (1), by separating the long exact sequence into short exact sequences such at 0 → Im C j → C j−1 → Im C j−1 → 0, applying (1), and performing substitutions using the resulting equations involving orders.Next (3) follows immediately from the definition. Finally (4) is well-known to the experts, but we could not find a reference, therefore we sketch the key ingredients in the proof. We introduce the following notation. Now we sketch the proof of (4). We will use the following five observations.Theorem A.17. Let M be a connected manifold with fundamental group π, and let A be an (R, Z[π])-bimodule.(1) Given Y ⊂ X ⊂ M there is a long exact sequence of pairs in homology(2) Suppose we have a chain of subspacesinduces an isomorphism in homology and cohomology i.e.. . . and cohomology(4) Suppose the inclusion Y → X is a homotopy equivalence, then the inclusion induced isomorphismsThe proofs are essentially the same as in the classical case. Therefore we will only sketch the arguments and focus on what is different. We also warn the reader that we give the "wrong proof" of statement (4). This is due to the fact that we developed the theory of chain level we have:In order to verify condition (2) of the bootstrap lemma we will need the following lemma (compare [Bre97, Lemma 8.2]).Lemma A.23. If K and L are two compact subsets of M , then the diagram Proof. The rows are exact by Mayer-Vietoris and the fact that direct limit is an exact functor. The commutativity of the squares is clear except for the last one involving the boundary map. This will be a painful diagram chase. Let U ⊃ K and V ⊃ L be open neighbourhoods containg K resp. L. The sequence in the top row comes from the short exact sequence (U = {U, V }):An element φ ∈Ȟ p (K ∩L; A) will already be represented by same element f ∈ C p (U ∩V ; A) for some U and V as above. We can extend f to an element f ∈ C p (M ; A) byNote that f ∈ C p (M ; A) since p −1 (U ∩ V ) is an equivariant subspace and hence f is equivariant. If we consider f as an element in C p (U ; A) then the cohomology class δ(φ) is represented by the cochain h ∈ C p+1 (U ∪ V ; A) which is given bySince φ is a cocycle we have δ(f )(σ) = 0 for σ ∈ C * (U ∩ V ; A). It follows in particular that if σ is a simplex whose image is completely contained in V , then h(σ) = 0. We can represent our orientation class θ ∈ H n (M, M \ (K ∪ L)) by a cyclewhere the vertical maps are isomorphisms by the homotopy invariance and the bottom row by the observation above. Hence condition (1) is verified. Condition (2) follows immediately from the five-lemma and Lemma A.23. Let K i be a sequence of compact subsets such that P M (K i ) holds for all i ∈ N. We set K = i∈N K i . It is an exercise in pointset topology of manifolds that each K i has a fundamental system U i,j of open neighbourhoods. Fundamental system means that U i,j ⊂ U i,k if j < k and that for each open set U containing K i there is a j such that U i,j ⊂ U . Another exercise in point set topology of manifolds shows, that one can construct these sets such that U 1,j ⊃ U 2,j ⊃ U 3,j ⊃ . . . for all j ∈ N. Then U i,j is a fundamental system of open neighbourhoods of K with the order (i, j) ≤ (k, l) ⇔ i ≤ k ∧ j ≤ l. One has the natural isomorphism [Bre97, Appendix D5]:And hence the theorem follows from the commutativity of the diagram:A.6. Proof of the Twisted Poincaré Duality Theorem A.15. For the reader's convenience we recall the main theorem from the last section. Here, as above, R is a ring and A is an (R, Z[π])-bimodule. Furthermore, we also recall that we need to prove the following theorem. In the remainder of this appendix we will explain how to deduce Theorem A.15 from Theorem A.20. First note that if M is a closed manifold, then we can set K = M in Theorem A.20. Evidently we haveȞ p (M ; A) = H(M ; A). Thus we obtain precisely the statement of Theorem A.15 in the closed case.Next let M be a compact oriented manifold with non-empty boundary. First we consider the case R = ∅ and S = ∂M . By the Collar neighbourhood theorem 2.5 there exists a collar ∂M ×[0, 2] ⊂ M of the boundary such that ∂M = ∂M ×{0}. We obtain the following chain of isomorphisms:
