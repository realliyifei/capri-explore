The vibrational resonance (VR) phenomenon has received a great deal of research attention over the two decades since its introduction. The wide range of theoretical and experimental results obtained has, however, been confined to VR in systems with constant mass. We now extend the VR formalism to encompass systems with position-dependent mass (PDM). We consider a generalized classical counterpart of the quantum mechanical nonlinear oscillator with PDM. By developing a theoretical framework for determining the response amplitude of PDM systems, we examine and analyse their VR phenomenona, obtain conditions for the occurrence of resonances, show that the role played by PDM can be both inductive and contributory, and suggest that PDM effects could usefully be explored to maximize the efficiency of devices being operated in VR modes. Our analysis suggests new directions for the investigation of VR in a general class of PDM systems.

This article is part of the theme issue 'Vibrational and stochastic resonance in driven nonlinear systems (part 1)'. analyses of VR in the PDM systems are presented in §3. Section 4 discusses our numerical simulations and §5 summarizes the results and draws conclusions.


## Position-dependent mass oscillators

We consider a classical oscillator whose dynamics may be described by the Lagrangian function [20] L(x,ẋ; t)
= T − V(x) = 1 2 m(x)ẋ 2 − V(x),(2.1)
where T = (1/2)m(x)ẋ 2 is the kinetic energy of the system, V(x) is the system's potential and m(x) is an explicitly PDM function with x being its position at time t. In the analysis that follows, we assume a Duffing-type oscillator potential, i.e.
V d (x) = 1 2 m(x)ω 2 0 x 2 + 1 4 βx 4 , (2.2)
where β is the potential parameter, i.e. the system's coefficient of nonlinearity and ω 0 is the oscillator's natural frequency. The associated Euler-Lagrange equation can be written as
d dt ∂L ∂ẋ − ∂L ∂x = φ,(2.3)
where φ accounts for all the external contributions to the motion from dissipative and driving forces, assumed here to be φ = −αẋ + f cos ωt + g cos Ωt. α is the damping coefficient and the amplitudes and frequencies of the external driving signals are f and ω for the weak component and g and Ω for the fast component, respectively. Using the Lagrangian function (2.1) in the Euler-Lagrange equation (2.3), the corresponding Newton's equation of motion may be written as
m(x)ẍ + 1 2 m (x)ẋ 2 + dV(x) dx = φ. (2.4)
The prime in equation (2.4) implies differentiation with respect to space variable x and the overdot indicates differentiation with respect to time.

As mentioned in the Introduction, §1, the nature of the problem or potential function considered determines the type of mass variation functions to be employed [14]. For instance, m(x) can be a quadratic or exponential function of position x [20,102,103]. The former has been classified on the basis of its singularity property: as either regular mass-functions without singularity or as singular mass-functions with single or dual singularities [20]. Moreover, a classification of finite-gap PDM systems with diverse physical applications, such as the families of trigonometric, hyperbolic and elliptic mass functions, was presented in [15]. In this paper, we adopt the simplest regular mass-function without singularities
m(x) = m 0 1 + λx 2 ,(2.5)
originally proposed by Mathews & Lakshmanan [14] in relation to relativistic fields of elementary particles. The mass-function (2.5) appears frequently in the modelling of diverse nonlinear mechanical systems (see [19,20] and references therein). Here, m 0 is a constant mass, equivalent to the mass amplitude and λ is the strength of the spatial nonlinearity in mass. m(x) is bounded and defined over the entire real line D(m 1 ) = with its maximum, m 0 , at x = 0 and varnishing as |x| → ∞.

One can easily show that the equation of motion of the PDM-Duffing oscillator can be written as
m(x)ẍ − m 2 (x)γ λxẋ 2 + αẋ + m 2 (x)γ ω 2 0 x + βx 3 = f cos ωt + g cos Ωt,(2.6)
where γ = 1/m 0 . Remarkably, the PDM-Duffing oscillator (equation (2.6)) is consistent with the system described by equation (23) in [19] for a unit mass amplitude (m 0 = 1) and g = 0.

When the strength of nonlinearity in mass is negligible, that is λ = 0, equation (2.6) reduces to the well-studied bi-harmonically driven Duffing oscillator (eqn (1) in [23] system is a generalized version of the model systems considered hitherto in the study of VR. A typical example of a physical system described by equation (2.6) is a dual-frequency-driven gas bubble in which the mass of the bubble is dependent on the bubble's radius-which is a spatial coordinate [104]. The dual-frequency driving force, which can be realized by means of acoustic waves with two frequency components, is applied to control the bubble's properties, including the promotion of acoustic cavitation. We refer the reader to a very recent study of driven bubbles highlighting the state of the art in applications of dual-frequency irradiation [105]. Moreover, the optical properties of semiconductor devices, such as Al x Ga 1−x m, many of which are also characterized by position-dependent effective masses [8,9], can be modulated and controlled effectively by employing external fields consisting of an applied electromagnetic field and a highfrequency intense laser field (ILF). The quantum mechanical counterpart of VR [75,76] would of course be more appropriate for the analysis of the combined impacts of the position-dependent effective mass (PDEM) and applied fields on the properties of semiconductors.

In what follows, we will express equation (2.6) in a form that makes our analytical procedure convenient for the application of the well-established method of separation of motions (MSM). This is the basis of the theoretical analysis. For a nonlinear system whose mass depends explicitly on position or velocity, or both, intuitively one would encounter a position-dependent function (k 1 ± k 2 x p ) n , where k 1 and k 2 are constants, and p and n are positive and negative integers, respectively. This function cannot fit into the general framework of MSM. By dividing equation (2.6) by m(x), we express it as
x − m 0 (1 + λx 2 ) −1 (γ λxẋ 2 − γ ω 2 0 x) + γ (1 + λx 2 )(αẋ + βx 3 ) = γ (1 + λx 2 )(f cos ωt + g cos Ωt),(2.7)
and obtain (k 1 ± k 2 x p ) n = (1 + λx) −1 which can be approximated using the Binomial expansion. Considering only the first three terms of the binomial expansion of (1 + λx 2 ) −1 , we write equation (2.7) asẍ
− m 0 (1 − λx 2 + λ 2 x 4 )(γ λxẋ 2 − γ ω 2 0 x) + γ (1 + λx 2 )(αẋ + βx 3 ) = γ (1 + λx 2 )(f cos ωt + g cos Ωt).
(2.8)

Furthermore, by setting δ = βγ − λω 2 0 , and ξ = βγ λ + λ 2 ω 2 0 , in equation (2.8), the PDM-Duffing oscillator can be expressed in the form
x − λ(x − λx 3 + λ 2 x 5 )ẋ 2 + αγ (1 + λx 2 )ẋ + ω 2 0 x + δx 3 + ξ x 5 = γ (1 + λx 2 )(f cos ωt + g cos Ωt).
(2.9)

The corresponding potential V(x) of the system is
V(x) = ω 2 0 2 x 2 + δ 4 x 4 + ξ 6 x 6 . (2.10)
Henceforth, we shall refer to equation (2.9) as the PDM-Duffing oscillator. The system potential is shown in figures 1 and 2 for different values of the PDM parameters: the mass amplitude m 0 (= 1, 1.5, 2, 4) and the strength of spatial nonlinearity λ(= 0, 1, 1.5, 2), respectively, is computed from equation (2.10). The dynamical properties of the system can be altered by adjustment of its potential which, in turn, is largely determined by the PDM parameters (m 0 , λ). We choose mass parameter regimes within which the system potential is double-well, so that 0 < m 0 < 1.5 and 0 < λ < 1 for α = 0.2, β = 1, ω 2 0 = −1.   


## Theoretical analysis

We now apply the standard MSM perturbation method, where the system's dynamics is assumed to be comprised of a slow component y(t) and a fast component z(t, τ ). The MSM method is used to derive two integro-differential equations in each component such that the superposition of their solutions completely solves the main equation of the system (equation (2.9)). Thus, defining x = y + z, and after factorizing like terms, the PDM-Duffing equation (2.9) can be re-written as y +z − λ(λ 2 y 5 + (5λ 2 z)y 4 + (10λ 2 z 2 − λ)y 3 + (10λ 2 z 3 − 3λz)y 2 + (5λ 2 z 4 − 3λz 2 + 1)y + λ 2 z 5 − λz 3 + z)(ẏ 2 + 2ẏż +ż 2 ) + αγ (1 + λ(y 2 + 2yz + z 2 ))(ẏ +ż) + ξ y 5 + 5ξ zy 4 By further expansion of equation (3.1), and considering that the fast signal z is rapidly oscillating with period 2π Ω , we havë y − λ(λ 2 y 5 + 5λ 2 zy 4 + (10λ 2 z 2 − λ)y 3 + (10λ 2 z 3 − 3λz)y 2 + (5λ 2 z 4 − 3λz 2 + 1)y + λ 2 z 5 − λz 3 + z)(ẏ 2 +ż 2 ) + αγ (1 + λ(y 2 + 2yz + z 2 ))ẏ + ξ y 5 + 5ξ zy 4 + (10ξ z 2 + δ)y 3 + (10ξ z 3 + 3δz)y 2 + (ω 2 0 + 5ξ z 4 + 3δz 2 )y + ω 2 0 z + δz 3 + ξ z 5 = γ (1 + λ(y 2 + 2yz + z 2 ))(f cos ωt + g cos Ωt).
+ (10ξ z 2 + δ)y 3 + (10ξ z 3 + 3δz)y 2 + (ω 2 0 + 5ξ z 4 + 3δz 2 )y + ω 2 0 z + δz 3 + ξ z 5 = γ (1 + λ(y 2 + 2yz + z 2 ))(f cos ωt + g cos Ωt).(

The mean value of z w.r.t fast time τ is given bȳ 
z = 1 2π 2π 0 z dτ = 0, (3.3) so that equation (3.2) becomes y − λ(λ 2 y 5 + (10λ 2 z 2 − λ)y 3 + 10λ 2 z 3 y 2 + (5λ 2 z 4 − 3λz 2 + 1)y + λ 2 z 5 − λz 3 )(ẏ 2 +ż 2 ) + αγ (1 + λ(y 2 + z 2 ))ẏ + ξ y 5 + (10ξ z 2 + δ)y 3 + 10ξ z 3 y 2 + (ω 2 0 + 5ξ z 4 + 3δz 2 )y + δz 3 + ξ z 5 = γ (1 + λ(y 2 + z 2 ))f cos ωt.z − (2ẏλ(λ 2 y 5 + (5λ 2 z)y 4 + (10λ 2 z 2 − λ)y 3 + (10λ 2 z 3 − 3λz)y 2 + (5λ 2 z 4 − 3λz 2 + 1)y + λ 2 z 5 − λz 3 + z) + αγ (1 + λ(y + z) 2 ))ż + λ 2 (ż 2 −ż 2 )y 5 + 5λ 2 (zż 2 − zż 2 )y 4 + (10λ 2 (z 2ż2 −z 2ż2 ) − λ(ż 2 −ż 2 ))y 3 + (10λ 2 (z 3ż2 −z 3ż2 ) − 3λ(zż 2 − zż 2 ))y 2 + (5λ 2 (z 4ż2 −z 4ż2 ) − 3λ(z 2ż2 −z 2ż2 ) + (ż 2 −ż 2 ))y + λ 2 (z 5ż2 −z 5ż2 ) − λ(z 3ż2 −z 3ż2 ) + (zż 2 − zż 2 ) + (ẏ 2 (5λ 2 y 4 − 3λy 2 + 1) + 2αγ λyẏ + 5ξ y 4 + 3δy 2 + ω 2 0 )(z − z) + (ẏ 2 (10λ 2 y 3 − 3λ) + 2αγ λyẏ + 10ξ y 3 + 3δy)(z 2 − z 2 ) + (ẏ 2 (10λ 2 y 2 − λ) + 10ξ y 2 + δ)(z 3 − z 3 ) + (ẏ 2 5λ 2 + 5ξ y)(z 4 − z 4 ) + (ẏ 2 λ 2 + ξ )(z 5 − z 5 ) = γ (1 + λ(y + z) 2 )(g cos Ωt) + γ λ(2y(z − z) + (z 2 − z 2 ))(f cos ωt). (3.5)
We note that equation (3.4) and (3.5) are a pair of integro-differential equations which describe the equations of slow oscillations y and fast vibrations z, respectively, and their superposition completely solves the composite system (equation (2.9)). Next, we apply the inertial approximationz ż z z 2 , by assuming the component z is much faster than the slow which has a solution
z = − γ g Ω 2 cos Ωt, (3.7)
leading to the mean values
z = z 3 = z 5 = 0, z 2 = γ 2 g 2 2Ω 4 , z 4 = 3γ 4 g 4 8Ω 8 andż 2 = γ 2 g 2 2Ω 2 . (3.8)
Using equation (3.8) in equation (3.4), the equation of motion for the slow component becomes
y − λ(λ 2 y 5 + (10λ 2 z 2 − λ)y 3 + (5λ 2 z 4 − 3λz 2 + 1)y)(ẏ 2 +ż 2 ) + αγ (1 + λ(y 2 + z 2 ))ẏ + ξ y 5 + (10ξ z 2 + δ)y 3 + (ω 2 0 + 5ξ z 4 + 3δz 2 )y = γ (1 + λ(y 2 + z 2 ))f cos ωt. (3.9)
Equation (3.9) can be simplified by collecting terms in y as
y − λ(λ 2 y 5 + (10λ 2 z 2 − λ)y 3 + (5λ 2 z 4 − 3λz 2 + 1)y)(ẏ 2 ) + αγ (1 + λ(y 2 + z 2 ))ẏ + (λ(5λ 2 z 4 − 3λz 2 + 1)ż 2 + ω 2 0 + 5ξ z 4 + 3δz 2 )y + (λ(10λ 2 z 2 − λ)ż 2 + (10ξ z 2 + δ))y 3 + (λ 3ż 2 + ξ )y 5 = γ (1 + λ(y 2 + z 2 ))f cos ωt. (3.10)
By setting
C 1 = 5λ 2 z 4 − 3λz 2 + 1 = 15λ 2 γ 4 g 4 8Ω 8 − 3λγ 2 g 2 2Ω 4 + 1, C 2 = 10λ 2 z 2 − λ = 5λ 2 γ 2 g 2 Ω 4 − λ, C 3 = 1 + λz 2 = 1 + λγ 2 g 2 2Ω 4 , η 1 = λC 1ż 2 + ω 2 0 + 5ξ z 4 + 3δz 2 = λC 1 γ 2 g 2 2Ω 2 + ω 2 0 + 15ξγ 4 g 4 8Ω 8 + 3δγ 2 g 2 2Ω 4 , η 2 = λC 2ż 2 + 10ξ z 2 + δ = λC 2 γ 2 g 2 2Ω 2 + 5ξγ 2 g 2 Ω 4 + δ, η 3 = λ 3ż 2 + ξ = λ 3 γ 2 g 2 2Ω 2 + ξ , ⎫ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎭ (3.11)
the system's slow oscillation described by equation (3.4) can be written as
y − λ(C 1 y + C 2 y 3 + λ 2 y 5 )ẏ 2 + αγ (C 3 + λy 2 )ẏ + η 1 y + η 2 y 3 + η 3 y 5 = γ (C 3 + λy 2 )f cos ωt. (3.12)
Thus, the effective potential of the system is given by
V eff (y) = η 1 2 y 2 + η 2 4 y 4 + η 3 6 y 6 . (3.13)
The slow oscillation takes place about one of the equilibrium points
y * 1 = 0, y * 2,3 = ± −η 2 + η 2 2 − 4η 1 η 3 2η 3 and y * 4,5 = ± −η 2 − η 2 2 − 4η 1 η 3 2η 3 .
(3.14)

The choice of the system parameters ω 2 , β, m 0 , λ, g and Ω determines the shape and depth of the effective potential since the magnitude and the signs of η 1 , η 2 and η 3 can be varied. Thus, the structure of V eff (y) can change depending on the sign of η 1 , η 2 and η 3 by varying any of the potential parameters (ω 2 , β), HF parameters (g, Ω) or PDM parameters (m 0 , λ  structures can be realized for different parameter choices. For instance, by assuming that η 3 > 0, the following cases arise:
(a) (b) -0.5 0 0.5 V eff (y) -0.3 -2 2 0 y 0 0.3 V eff (y) l = 0 g = 0 g = 40 g = 60 g = 80 l = 0.02 l = 0.05 l = 0.1Case I η 1 , η 2 > 0, or η 1 > 0, η 2 < 0 with η 2 2 < 4η 1 η 3 .
The only equilibrium point is y * 1 . Case II η 1 < 0, η 2 -arbitrary. Three equilibrium points exist: −y * 1 , y * 2,3 . Case III η 1 > 0, η 2 < 0 with η 2 2 > 4η 1 η 3 . Five equilibrium points exist: −y * 1 , y * 2,3 , y * 4,5 .

Clearly, the effective potential is not just dependent on the parameters of the fast driving signal, as is typical of the VR phenomenon, but also depends on the parameters (m 0 , λ) of the PDMimplying that either or both of the PDM parameters must make a significant contribution to the shapes of the resonances. The effective potential of the driven PDM-Duffing oscillator given by equation ( By varying the HF amplitude, the shape and depth of V eff (y) can be altered from double-well (at g = 0, 25, 40) to single-well (at g = 80) by choice of the HF amplitude g, even when the PDM parameters (m 0 , λ) are restricted to the regime (m 0 , λ) ∈ ((0, 1.5), (0, 1)) where the system has a double-well potential in the absence of the HF signal. Additionally, in the presence of an HF signal, the shape and depth of the effective potential V eff (y) can be altered from single-well (when λ = 0.05, 0.1) to double-well (when λ = 0, 0.02) depending on the choice of strength of mass nonlinearity λ.

Next, we linearize equation (3.12) around the equilibrium points (y * ,ẏ * ) in order to obtain an approximate analytic response amplitude Q ana which can also be compared to the response amplitude Q num obtained from the Fourier coefficients of the solution of the full equation of the system (2.9). The system's oscillation can be described in terms of the deviation of slow motion y from the equilibrium points y * by using the deviation variable Y = y − y * in equation (3.12). This yields the motion around equilibrium points in the form where = C 1 y * + C 2 y * 3 + λ 2 y * 5 , 1 = C 1 + 3C 2 y * 2 + 5λ 2 y * 4 , 2 = 3C 2 y * + 10λ 2 y * 2 , 3 = C 2 + 10λ 2 y * 2 , 4 = 5λ 2 y * , Ξ 1 = C 3 + λy * 2 , Ξ 2 = 2λy * , Θ = η 1 y * + η 2 y * 3 + η 3 y * 5 , Θ 1 = η 1 + 3η 2 y * 2 + 5η 3 y * 4 ,

By ignoring the nonlinear parts of equation (3.15) and using the approximation f 1 such that |Y| 1 in the long-term limit t → ∞, the linearized equation of motion then becomes
Y + μẎ + ω 2 r Y = F cos ωt,(3.17)
where the resonant frequency is ω r = √ η 1 , μ = αγ C 3 and F = γ C 3 f when the oscillation is considered around the equilibrium point y * = 0. For y * = 0, ω 2 r = Θ 1 , μ = αγ Ξ 1 and F = γ (Ξ 1 + Ξ 2 Y + λY 2 )f . It is clear that the steady-state solution of equation (3.12) takes the form (3.18) and that the response amplitude can be computed as
Y(t) = A L cos(ωt + Φ),Q ana = A L f = γ C 3 (ω 2 r − ω 2 ) 2 + μ 2 ω 2 . (3.19)
If we set S = (ω 2 r − ω 2 ) 2 + μ 2 ω 2 in equation (3.19), the qualitative features of Q ana would be determined by S. A local minimum in S implies resonance, i.e. the appearance of a maximum in Q ana . When a variation of any of the system parameters leads the system to resonance, the value of the parameter at which resonance occurs (e.g. λ = λ vr ) can be obtained from the root of the equation S λ = dS/dλ = 0 and S λλ|λ=λ vr > 0.

When the sign of either η 1 or η 2 is changed by varying any of g, Ω, m 0 or λ, the effective potential changes structure from single-well to double-well as shown in figure 3. The value of g vr and λ vr when the effective potential is single-well can be obtained by setting S g = 0 and S λ = 0 and satisfies the condition
g vr = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ { √ z | z σ 1 } ∪ {− √ z | z σ 1 }, if e = 0,±Ω 2 −b ± (σ 2 − dΩ 2 ) σ 3 , if a = cΩ 2 ∧ e = 0 (3.20) where a = 15γ 4 ξ 8 , b = 3δγ 2 2 , c = 3λ2γ 4 4 , d = 15γ 4 ξ 8 , e = 15 λ 3 γ 6 16 , f = ω 2 − ω 2 0 , σ 1 = (e z 3 − c Ω 4 z 2 + a Ω 2 z 2 + d Ω 8 z + f Ω 10 ),σ 2 = b 2 + 2b dΩ 2 + d 2 Ω 4 + 4cf Ω 2 − 4af , σ 3 = 2(a − cΩ 2 ). ⎫ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎭ (3.21)
In addition, the resonance condition for λ vr gives When the effective potential is a double-well, it is challenging to establish analytical conditions in terms of g vr and λ vr . However, they can be computed numerically by analysing the cases ω 2 r − ω 2 = 0 and ω rg = 0 or ω rλ = 0 since S g = 0 ( or S λ = 0) at resonance.

## Numerical results and discussions

To validate the analytic results, the theoretical response amplitude Q given by equation (3.19) was compared with the numerical Q computed from the Fourier spectrum of the solution of the main PDM-Duffing equation (equation (2.9)) expressed as coupled first-order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form dx dt = y,
dy dt = λ(x − λx 3 + λ 2 x 5 )ẋ 2 − αγ (1 + λx 2 )ẋ − ω 2 0 x − δx 3 − ξ x 5 + γ (1 + λx 2 )(f cos ωt + g cos Ωt). ⎫ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎭ (4.1)
The solution of equation (4.1), corresponding to the output signal of the system, is obtained by numerical integration using the fourth order Runge-Kutta (FORK) scheme with step size t = 0.01T over a simulation time interval T s = nT, where T = 2π ω is the period of the oscillation, ω is the low frequency (LF) of the input signal and n(= 1, 2, 3, . . . ) is the number of complete oscillations. We used (x(0),ẋ(0.1)) initial conditions with a relaxation time of 20T. Except where otherwise specified, the values of fixed system parameters were: α = 0.2, β = 1, ω 2 0 = −1, Ω = 9.842, ω = 0.5 and f = 0.05. The PDM parameters were set as (m 0 , λ) ∈ ((0, 1.5), (0, 1)). These parameter choices ensure that the system remains in the overdamped regime for which only periodic or quasiperiodic motion is admissible and where the system remains a bistable oscillator. The other system parameters were chosen within regimes that optimize the emergence of VR for n = 200.

The response amplitude Q at frequency ω was then obtained from the Fourier sine and cosine coefficients of the output signal with components Q s and Q c given by Conventionally, the amplitude of the output signal is given by
A = Q 2 s + Q 2 c . (4.3)
while the phase shift is

The response amplitude is thus given by

The analytically computed response amplitudes from equation (   increases. Thus, for a Duffing oscillator with a unitary particle mass, the mass amplitude plays a complementary role to the HF signal parameters (g, Ω) in the observed resonances.

Furthermore, the possibility of initiating resonance through variation of the PDM mass amplitude, with the cooperation of the HF input signal, is confirmed by the results presented in figure 5. Figure 5a shows the dependence of the response amplitude Q on m 0 for four values of the HF amplitude g(= 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) for a particle with constant mass (λ = 0). Resonances with single peaks at m 0 (Q max ) directly dependent on the HF amplitude g can be seen for each value of g. Although resonances can thus be achieved by varying g, there is no significant optimization, and the impact of g on Q is a shift in the peak position in the direction of increasing m 0 . In addition, by switching on the mass spatial nonlinearity and examining the dependence of Q on m 0 for increasing mass nonlinearity (λ = 0, λ = 0.1, λ = 0.2, λ = 0.5) at g = 20, single resonance peaks indicative of VR for the dependence of Q on g (or Ω, shown in figure 4b) are observed for each value of λ. It is evident that the mass amplitude m 0 can be used to initiate VR or/and can complement the HF input signal parameters in determining the conditions for resonance. This is similar to the effect of constant mass on the VR phenomenon observed in the dynamics of an inhomogeneously damped one-dimensional single particle moving in a symmetrical periodic potential [37,101]. For the observed resonances in figure 5, the PDM mass amplitude m 0 and the HF signal amplitude g are directly related: increasing the value of g corresponds to increasing the value of mass amplitude m 0 .

To gain further insight into the contributions of the PDM to VR, we also considered the effect of the PDM nonlinear strength λ on the observed resonances. First, we showed that the resonances for constant unitary mass can also be realized with a suitable combination of PDM parameters when the mass spatial nonlinearity is activated. This is presented in figure 6a- This implies that, besides the independent impact of the mass amplitude m 0 , the combination of PDM parameters plays a role in determining the conditions for VR. The variation of the response amplitude Q with HF amplitude g for four values of spatial nonlinearity strength λ (λ = 0, λ = 0.05, λ = 0.2, λ = 0.5) is presented in figure 7 for m 0 = 1.1. The shape of the resonance curve, maximum response amplitude Q max , and g(Q max ) all depend on λ. The maximum response amplitude Q max at which VR occurs decreases as the strength of the spatial nonlinearity increases, as presented in the inset (b) of figure 7. Here, we have zoomed the top portions of the numerically computed response curves, i.e. figure 7a.

Finally, figure 8 demonstrates that cooperation between the HF input signal and the PDM parameters can induce VR through the mass spatial nonlinearity strength λ for m 0 = 1. This is presented for four values of the HF input signal amplitude g(g = 20, g = 25, g = 30, g = 35) in figure 8a-d, respectively. The observed single resonances are typical of VR induced by the HF input parameters. In this figure, resonance occurs for a pair of low values of λ and high values of g, illustrating the cooperation effect between the HF driving force and the PDM in the VR process. In general, the strength of the spatial nonlinearity optimizes the effect of HF amplitude when the system is driven into resonance and vice versa.

In figure 9, we present a three-dimensional plot illustrating the numerically computed response amplitude Q as functions of both the strength of the mass nonlinearity λ and the HF signal amplitude g for ω (= 0.   figure 3, the effective potential changes from a double-well structure (for g = 0) to a single-well structure as g takes on larger values, such that g ≥ 80. The transition to a double-well structure is readily enhanced by the cooperation between the PDM parameter λ and the high-frequency amplitude g. Figure 10 presents a broader picture of the effect of the PDM parameters (λ, m 0 ) on the system's response amplitude Q. Here, Q was also computed numerically. It is plotted in 3D as  


## Summary and conclusion

We have provided a detailed but succinct review of the VR phenomenon [23], which was proposed two decades ago. We cite numerous works exploring and elucidating the mechanism of VR in several different systems, as well as the contributory or inductive roles of diverse system parameters in the occurrence of VR. Practical experimental realizations and applications of VR have also been explored and discussed. We emphasize that many of the above investigations deal with additive driving forces, whereas rather less attention is paid to parametric driving and amplitude-modulated forcing [34,[65][66][67][68][69]. In connection with signal detection, transmission and amplification, parametric driving and amplitude modulated forcing are excellent tools for achieving higher laser modulation bandwidths which are desirable qualities for applications in multigigabit optical fibre transmitters [107] and could be suitable for designing measurement techniques where highfrequency response is required [108]. Thus, exploring high-frequency parametric vibrations could find practical applications in communications systems as well as in the detection and assessment of structural damage in systems with breathing cracks-suggesting a new direction for VR investigations.

Complementing all of the previous VR investigations, where systems had constant mass, we have demonstrated VR in a Duffing oscillator whose mass is position dependent. In particular, we considered the PDM-Duffing, with the mass defined as a regular function comprising mass amplitude m 0 and strength of spatial nonlinearity λ. Based on the generalized Duffing oscillator equation with PDM, we presented and validated the VR phenomenon in a bistable potential by considering the reduced case in which m 0 = 1, λ = 0. We then extended the problem by examining the effects of the mass parameters on the response curves (Q versus g) and explored the resonances induced by the PDM parameters in the presence of the HF input signal. We conclude that, in the generalized PDM-Duffing oscillator, the roles played by PDM are both inductive and contributory. They can with advantage be explored to maximize the efficiency of devices that operate in VR modes. We believe that our new formalism describing VR in PDM systems, and its applications as enumerated above, paves the way to a new body of research on VR.

Other parameters are set as: Ω = 9.842, ω = 0.5, α = 0.2, β = 1, ω 2 0 = −1. The thick lines represent analytically computed response amplitudes from equation (3.19) while thin lines, broken lines and markers of the same colour represent the numerically computed response amplitude from the main equation of the PDM-Duffing oscillator (equation (2.9)) using equation (4.5). m(x) = m 0 and λ = 0, corresponding to a Duffing oscillator with constant mass. Remarkably, for a particle with constant unitary mass (m 0 = 1, λ = 0), the PDM-Duffing oscillator (equation (2.9) is reduced to the bistable oscillator considered in the pioneering work on VR by Landa & McClintock [23]. As expected for this special case, VR is observed as shown in figure 4. In fact, the results of the preliminary analysis for a PDM-Duffing system with constant unitary mass as presented in figure 4a are consistent with both the theoretical and numerical results presented by Blekhmann & Landa (see fig. 2b of [106]). Further evidence of VR in this special case is presented for the dependence of the response amplitude Q on the HF amplitude g for three values of the LF ω(= 0.1, 0.25, 0.1), as shown in figure 4b for f = 0.01. Next, we consider the effect of the PDM parameters on the observed resonances and thus focus on the possible impact of the mass parameters m 0 and λ. First, we consider the effect of the mass amplitude m 0 on known resonances for the preliminary case λ = 0, as presented in figure 4c for the variation of the response amplitude Q with HF amplitude g for the constant unitary mass m 0 = 1 and three larger and smaller values (m 0 = 0.5, m 0 = 1.3, m 0 = 1.5) for f = 0.05 and other parameters unchanged. In figure 4c, for m 0 = 1 and ω = 0.5, the resonance curve confirms the response curve presented by Landa & McClintock [23] (see Curve 2 of figure 2a, left panel). The VR phenomenon also exists for the other mass amplitudes considered (in figure 4c), with no significant enhancement as m 0 increases but with a marked shift in the HF amplitude value for which Q is maximum. As m 0 increases, this optimal HF amplitude value g(Q max ) also royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsta Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

The value of the mass nonlinear strength λ determines the occurrence of either single-or double-peaked resonances with ω = 0.5 as shown in figure 9c. For λ = 0, figure 9a-c provides a clearer picture of the features depicted in figure 4b in relation to the occurrence of VR in the system and, in addition, demonstrates the possibility of obtaining VR at other values of mass nonlinear strength (0 < λ ≤ 0.8). Thus, salient features of the superposed resonance curves in figure 4b are validated by figure 9a-c including: (i) the royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsta Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

In the 3D plot of figure 9, the above details are obvious with a single-peaked resonance appearing when λ = 0 in figure 9a,b and double-peaked resonances when λ 0 in figure 9c. Further increase in the value of ω to ω = 1 results in sustained double-peaked resonances for all values of mass nonlinear strength 0 ≤ λ ≤ 0.8 as shown in figure 9d. Note that in

Resonance peaks take the form of ridge-shaped 'hills', stretching along λ parameter values and spreading across the (g, λ)-plane when m 0 is increased, as shown in figure 10a-d. The results clearly indicate the continuous occurrence of single resonance peaks. Indeed a slice of figure 10 along λ = 0 is consistent with figure 4c in terms of the values of amplitude g at which resonances occur. There is also a correspondence between the increase in the value of the HF signal amplitude and the increase in the mass amplitude m 0 , as indicated in figures 4c and 5. This correspondence can be generalized for all values of λ ∈ (0, 0.8). Moreover, the occurrence of resonance for different combinations of PDM parameters as presented in figure 6 for four combinations of PDM parameters is also illustrated in figure 10. The inverse relationship between the response amplitude Q and the strength of mass nonlinearity λ as depicted in figure 7 and figure 8 for m 0 = 1 can be validated by considering the values of g where resonances occur along the λ-axis in figure 10b. This inverse relationship between g vr and λ vr becomes pronounced with increasing values of m 0 (m 0 = 0.5, 1.0, 1.3, 1.5) as shown in figure 10a-d, and manifests as a gradual spread royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsta Phil.
