Potentially eligible patients are put on competing trials without co-enrollment Referring physicians do not recommend the study to patients Difficulty with availability of QIN research staff due to understaffing/turnover Patients are reluctant -study takes too much time Patients are reluctant -study does not benefit them personally Patients are reluctant -fears about radiation exposure Other Greatest challenge to accrual (other) __________________________________Not a QIN site or affiliate

Accrual Challenges 

(FAQ for Accrual Questionnaire) 

Perceived reasons for accrual challenges 
Too few eligible patients 
Competing trials do not allow co-enrollment 
Potentially eligible patients are not approached 
Patients decline participation 
Scheduling: limited time on clinical scanner 
Scheduling: scanner broken/tracer unavailable 
Scheduling: imaging staff not available when 
patient is 
Other 
((check all that apply)) 

Other perceived reasons for accrual challenges 
__________________________________ 

Why do you think patients were not approached 
QIN staff not available when primary study 
contacted to see a patient 
Gaps in QIN research staffing due to turnover 
Referring oncologist / surgeon not enthusiastic 
about QIN study 
A competing trial is higher institutional priority 
Other 
((check all that apply))
