## Introduction

The community certainly knows that in a work aspect, of course, it can never be separated from the safety and accident aspects, which in the work aspect, of course, can never be separated from these two words so that it can be developed in the concept of the company as said by (Elvik, 2013) in his study where the term concept of safety in a job is usually connected to aspects of work that are connected and simulated as a form of process that is used as one way to prevent the existence of an occupational risk that can result in accidents that can damage the order of life of workers and this will automatically be the concept of safety in each division will be able to alleviate and make it easier for workers to organize their work so as not to be indicated in terms of mixing risks and be able to estimate the existence of a risk that can occur. Broadly speaking, every company will certainly implement ways so that workers who are in the company get a guarantee of safety which will certainly greatly affect the influence of the work done.

From this concept, it can be termed that the concept of a job has several aspects of division which is one of the basic concepts in an organization where the scope of the organization indicates the existence of a professional context in developing an element-an element that is implicated in an organizational principle which is where in the theory of organization mentioned, 2019) that aspects of a work life started by a worker are generally adapted to activities carried out by an individual whose activity has individual elements as actors even in other contexts, it becomes a need and has even become a common phenomenon in a person's work which is generally carried out through aspects of his survival from meeting his needs. This is the main reason that a company prospect really needs the field of human resources as quoted from (Dewi & Harjoyo, 2019) that the human resource aspect is an aspect or a potential where it refers to individuals or in its chronology refers to the source of the ability or capability of an individual in his work environment which includes other sources of behavior and influence. Broadly speaking, an aspect or concept of a resource has a very important meaning in the work life of individuals which but the needs of the company, it also becomes a prospect that is very important in the basis of the needs of the work done because both of these are interconnected with the context of the needs experienced by people who work directly in the corporate world. This resource capability becomes a major role even as well as a potential and development within the individual so as to provide support and benefits in generating productivity that is so strong in the environmental organization.

Based on the previous aspect, it can be seen that an aspect of Human Resources has a great degree of influence in a company which is not only as a lifeskill development process but it is also able to support the welfare of workers and is also able to influence other aspects in this context and become a source of reference for entrepreneurs in running their business. However, as it is known that within the company sometimes it does not rule out the possibility of accidents at work as mentioned by (Handari & Qolbi, 2021) that one of the accident cases that often occurs in the workplace is one of the large enough number of cases that occur in Indonesia. In the aspect of the accident, there are indications or factors that reflect the cause of the accident, namely unsafe action (88%), unsafe condition (10%), and things beyond human control (2%). From this percentage, it can be described that the human factor or the category of unsafe action is one of the factors that make the accident can occur and be high compared to other reasons or factors where in the employment sector, this is common and often associated with a lack of supervision from job sector supervisors even in other indicators, aspects of resources in the company are lacking, causing the supervision to be minimal and reduced. From these references, some companies have attempted to organize resources in their company by using human resources strategy management or known as K3 Management, which is a strategy that regulates safety for each worker, especially in every aspect of the needs of each existing division and this has become a top priority where this step begins with the Human Resources Division management system that directs and begins to open the main concept of each division to direct each worker to get safety guarantees.

This review aims primarily to see the effectiveness of each influence of the implementation of Human Resource Strategy Management in an industry. In particular, the location of this strategy becomes a safety reference that is often used in overcoming things that cause accidents while still working. This term has been used often and is a fairly large basis when compared with other aspects. Contextually, in various reviews it has been explained in general and has even become a system that often rotates and often becomes a common change if associated with the implementation system as in the review (Hermansyah et al., 2022) that management practitioners are usually used in the aspect of profit-making in obtaining other fundamental aspects, especially in achieving the success of the organization, management practitioners are often used as developers of strategies and alternatives, especially in bringing these aspects to the level of resource assessment and ultimately can empower workers. This approach is also often associated with the social aspects of organizing these workers in order to raise the practitioner to a higher level and become a major development in the strategy to organize the scope of a company so that the company runs smoothly in terms of sales. This is because the level of strategic management is defined as a process of recognizing potential and also includes improving the skills possessed so that the level of potential can develop and become more useful for several problems that are often related to the welfare of workers.

One of them refers to safety indicators which are often forgotten by the human resources division which refers to the context of overcoming accidents that generally occur and this has often become a topic that is so large and widespread, especially in contexts related to organizations. As reviewed by (Herlina, 2022), the context of human resources not only represents the perception of the efficiency of a resource management but also represents an accident prevention indicator that refers to the productivity of workers so that it can be maximized and the impact is greater, especially in people's lives. However, these two studies have not been able to provide such strong support, especially in proving the effectiveness or impact is so great in achieving its objectives as follows. Therefore, this study was carried out to reveal the impact of the implementation of human resource management strategies used in various sectors, especially in the world of Health and the business world.


## Theoretical studies Understanding Human Resource Management

The context of human resources according to  in his review includes several aspects and it has even been said that as a profitability that has always been fulfilled and includes several previous aspects and has become a field that follows the era of changing times. In this case, the resource aspect is not new and is not something that is so important that is included in the indicators of the development of the lives of workers who are working at the company, so that it can be assumed that human resources are a form of recognizing one's potential academically or skillfully. so that the individual is able to be more active and become a certain adequacy. Other opinions put forward by (Qomariah, 2020) the role of human resources is a quarter percent having a special contribution in increasing the potential possessed by these individuals and this increase is not only able to describe the environment and increase the assessment of the productivity of the workforce so that this then becomes state considerations in bringing resources as one of the main influences within the environment of these companies. In addition to this, the context of human resources cannot be said to be appropriate or in accordance with the applicable organizational principles so that many companies do not use environmental aspects much and generally it is more likely that environmental aspects that use aspects of human resources have not been able to guarantee the level of potential that they have. owned by an individual so that in the 80s, the aspect of this resource was increasingly changed, especially in its use which was no longer just assumed as an approach but as an alternative.

In a critical review (Hermansyah et al., 2022) related to the human resources aspect is introduced as a human resources strategy and is associated with the concept of management so that a human resource that is applied is better able to avoid problems that generally occur. Not only that, in a review carried out by (Herlina, 2022) it was said that this strategic management aspect is an important principle that is controlled by each division to supervise the workers who work so that they are more able to be careful in their activities. This concept is often out of the field of human resources where this concept leads to the application of human resource management so that it is more efficient at work and also produces maximum profits compared to conventional human resource use efforts. This aspect is the main introduction in the field of activity or in terms of triggering a level of productivity in a work Foundation. The difference with the aspect of human resources is in the functions used.


## The Role Of Management In Human Resource Development

The contribution or function held directly by the development of human resources creates more effort or deeper interest, especially in the context of development that is feared to be weak and can no longer help the field of human resources so that it will no longer be able to produce qualified workers and this context is said to be a form of greater implications than the context of a major basic form that According to (Husaini, 2017), the roles held by the field of human resources are as follows:

1) Implementing organizational services, generally HR management plays a role in maintaining relationships between employees, avoiding work strikes, while ensuring the smooth functioning of the organization. 2) Carrying out forms of service for other departments, in this case aspects of management include HR Planning, Job Analysis, recruitment and selection processes, orientation and induction, training and development, performance appraisal, compensation and remuneration planning, and motivation. The objective is, of course, to ensure the growth and effectiveness of the individual, so as to contribute to the development of the company. 3) Implement the form of service of employees of the organization, which pays attention to the welfare of employees. HR management, of course, needs to follow health and safety regulations for the benefit of employees. This relates to office conditions and facilities such as canteens, rest rooms, dining rooms, transportation, medical assistance, education, recreational facilities, and others.


## History Of Human Resource Management Strategy Period and figures Development Of Human Resource Strategy Management 1970

Management aspects began to be developed using 2 forms of basic change models, namely the change of the old administration to a more modern side and re-orientation of the strategy model used 1992-1998 This development is then directly criticized by various expert opinions that are connected with the context of the old approach to see the growth and development of the model 2002

This aspect of development was then revised and began to spread some aspects that are used against firms or business fields that are run and become such a dynamic concept.


## Effect Of Resource Strategy Management On Worker Safety

In the review imposed by (Alsaadat, 2019), that the human resources aspect contains the notion of work effort or services that can be provided in the production process. In other terms human resources reflect the quality of effort exerted by a person in a given time to produce a good or service. The second definition, human resources concerns people who are able to work to provide services or work efforts. Being able to work means being able to carry out activities that have economic activity, that is, that these activities produce goods or services to meet the needs or community.

Development (development) represents efforts to improve the ability of employees to handle various tasks and to increase capabilities beyond the capabilities required by current work (Putra & Sobandi, 2019) explained that human resource development is a process carried out to develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities of workers, as well as competencies developed through training and development, organizational learning, leadership management, and knowledge management for the benefit of improving performance. In a broader sense, Human Resource Development seeks to develop knowledge, experience, expertise, productivity, and employee satisfaction. Human Resource Development can be defined as a set of systematic and planned activities designed by an organization to provide its members with the opportunity to learn the skills necessary to meet the demands of current and future jobs. (Dewi & Harjoyo, 2019) mentioned that human resource development is a strategic approach to investing in human resources. Human Resource Development provides a framework for self-development, training programs and career advancement tailored to the needs of skills in the organization in the future. Human Resource Development is a process to improve the ability of human resources to help achieve organizational goals.

So, this is very important and prioritized in terms of safety as mentioned by (Utami, 2017) that in the era of globalization of industrial development so rapidly, companies must be able to develop their human resources. The company must be able to produce high-quality products. To produce high-quality products required qualified human resources as well. Human resources have an important role in the company, because the role and function can not be replaced. No matter how modern the technology used by the company but if there is no qualified human resources. human resources is an important component in the company to run the company's production process. Therefore the company must pay attention to the safety of employees, this is done to provide comfort in creating a sense of security for employees, especially in the production so it is very important to regulate the safety of these workers.
