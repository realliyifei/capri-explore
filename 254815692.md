## Introduction

With a shift to evidence-based medicine over the past 30 years, the availability of high-quality research in orthopedics and the skills to interpret and utilize research are increasingly important for the delivery of care and improved patient outcomes [1]. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) sets forth core competencies for orthopedic residents, which include an expectation for residents to effectively assess the available literature for evidence to inform and improve practice [2]. Furthermore, the ACGME requires scholarly activity for trainees, including orthopedic residents and orthopedic fellows. There is no specific mandate for what qualifies as scholarly activity, but many surgical specialties stipulate research activities to fulfill this requirement [1,3,4]. Despite this, many orthopedic residencies may not have protected research times [5].

At present, there is little evidence of what orthopedic residencies require for the fulfillment of the scholarly activity requirement, the current state of research at orthopedic residency programs, or the perceived barriers to meeting the same academic standards as other surgical specialties. In this study, we aimed to better understand how orthopedic residency programs implement research into training and the program directors' perceptions of the value of research during training. We conducted a survey of program directors at ACGME-accredited orthopedic residencies and fellowships to better understand the current state of research during training.


## Materials And Methods


## Methods

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (2019P001219), the authors developed a survey using RedCap® to determine orthopedic surgery programs (n=74) and fellowship directors' (n=44) demographics, program type (academic versus community), and whether research was required for graduation. For programs requiring research, respondents indicated the components, timing, opinions, perceived barriers, and satisfaction levels for the current research experience. Surveys were emailed to all ACGME-accredited orthopedic residency and fellowship programs between 2019 and 2020, and responses were collected over a four-month period bridging the 2019 and 2020 academic years. Our study timeline was not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as our collected data had been finalized before the start of the 2020 academic year.


## Statistics

Significance and beta values were set at 0.05 and 0.2, respectively. We assessed power using the Student's ttest and the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess the normality of distribution. Descriptive statistics are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for parametric data and median (interquartile range (IQR)) for nonparametric data. Categorical data were assessed with chi-squared analysis and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data; nonparametric continuous data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and Friedman's two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to related samples. Likert scales were used to assess subjective data. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis.


## Results

A total of 118 surveys were completed. Academic programs, as defined by program/fellowship directors, accounted for 79.6% of responses (N=94), and community programs accounted for 21.4% of responses (N=24). Forty-four (37.3%) of the respondents were fellowship directors, 39 (88.6%) of whom were in academic programs. Formal research tracks were offered at six academic programs and one community program.

Academic programs were four times more likely to receive public funding compared to community programs (p=0.044) ( Table 1). Institutional or departmental grants for the primary purpose of funding research at the program were reported by 57.1% and 16.7% of public and private institutions, respectively (p=0.010). Additional demographic information for program directors and their programs is summarized in Table 1.  Research requirements and components were recorded and compared. Three (academic) programs did not require research for graduation; of the 115 (97.5%) remaining programs that required research, only 65 (56.5%) provided dedicated time for research. Fifty-two (55.3%) academic programs allotted a median of nine weeks (IQR: 8-12 weeks) of dedicated time, while 13 (54.2%) community programs allotted six weeks (IQR: 4-28 weeks) (p=0.595). While we found that only 96.8% of academic programs require research for graduation as compared to 100% of community programs requiring research for graduation, this result was not significant. Most programs provided research training for their residents in the form of two or three annual lectures, and most projects were original ideas (versus assigned topics) at both academic and community programs. Research oversight was similar among all programs (p=0.131); program directors typically provided general oversight, and individual projects were universally assigned at least one faculty mentor for guidance and accountability. These results are displayed in Table 2.  


## Opinions on research

The only statistically significant difference of opinion between academic and community program directors was the rating of "neutral" regarding whether research is an integral part of orthopedic training (5.3% academic versus 20.8% community, p=0.03) ( Table 3).  


## Research focus

Program directors agreed on shifting the focus of research toward basic science using a sliding scale where "0" indicated "entirely basic science" and "100" indicated "entirely clinical or outcomes-based." Overall, directors rated the current research focus at an average of 77.7 and an ideal focus of 62.5, suggesting more basic science-based research is desired (Friedman's two-way 100 analysis of variance (ANOVA), p<0.04). As shown in Figure 1, no differences were found when stratifying responses by program type.

## Barriers to research

Academic and community program directors reported a similar distribution of concerns over trainee perceptions of research, historical precedents, and attitudinal barriers to improving research at their individual programs. However, academic programs reported significantly lower concern over faculty and resource availability (59.8% versus 19%, Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.003) ( Figure 2). FIGURE 2: Level of concern over faculty and resource availability


## Satisfaction among trainees and faculty

Pairwise comparison of trainee and faculty satisfaction levels as reported by the program directors, independent of program type, showed a higher proportion of dissatisfaction among faculty members (13.6% versus 4.2%), while trainees had proportionally higher satisfaction (66.1% versus 42.2%, p=0.003). Evaluated as an average score, however, no difference was found in the overall level of satisfaction of trainees versus faculty (p=0.296). Sixty-eight (57.6%) programs reported concordant satisfaction scores for faculty and trainees. Of these, 45 programs (overall: 38%) were satisfied with the current research experience (Spearman's rho=0.556, p<0.001). No variables were found to be associated with higher concordance or satisfaction ratings. These results are summarized in Figure 3.

## Fellowship directors

Forty-four (37.3%) respondents were fellowship directors, 39 (88.6%) of whom were in academic programs.

Using multivariate regression, we found that fellowship director responses were similar to the residency program director responses for all variables after controlling for program type. Community fellowship directors reported a higher degree of faculty satisfaction with the current research experience (3.7 versus 3.2 out of 5.0, p<0.05) and a higher degree of concern over faculty and resource commitment to research (3.1 versus 2.0 out of 5.0, p<0.001). Fellowship directors also reported the desired shift toward basic science research with no difference between academic and community fellowships (p>0.5).  , but not director type (residency versus fellowship), was associated with the observed differences between faculty satisfaction and concern over faculty and resource commitment Note: Bolded values are significantly different at p<0.05.

## Discussion

We evaluated the research requirements, components, and general perceptions reported by 118 orthopedic surgery program and fellowship directors at ACGME-accredited academic and community training programs. The differences between academic and community programs, such as the level of concern over faculty and resource availability and the proportion of programs that were privately or publicly funded, were expected and consistent with previously reported data [5]. On the other hand, we did not anticipate several variables that were shared among all program directors regardless of their program designation, in particular, the number of programs that do not allocate protected time for research despite requiring it for graduation, the variability of the protected time when provided, and the shared desire to shift the focus of resident research toward basic science. These variables are actionable and impactful and warrant further discussion.

Time is perhaps the most invaluable yet overlooked resource to support research [5,6]. Despite a consensus on the importance of research during training and a near consensus (97.5%) of research activity as a graduation requirement, 45% of programs do not provide protected time to participate in research; those that do provide a median of nine weeks and six weeks at academic and community programs, respectively. In a study of 125 orthopedic residency programs, Williams et al. found that the type of dedicated research time correlates with residents' research productivity [5]. Products such as posters and abstracts for local or institutional presentations were deemed unacceptable for the fulfillment of research requirements at 85% of the academic programs in our survey. These programs stipulated research as publishable manuscripts, clinical trial design and IRB submission, and regional or national podium presentations, all of which are considerably more time-intensive. ACGME guidelines for sponsoring institutions state that educational resources to support resident research should be provided [7]. Although academic programs provide research materials and dedicated personnel, these do little for residents if adequate time to access those resources is not also provided [8].

We also found an overall desire among directors to shift the focus of research toward basic science. This finding is consistent with reported trends. Current orthopedic literature shows waning numbers of preclinical publications and a concomitant increase in clinical publications without consistent increases in high-level evidence studies across subspecialties [9][10][11][12]. Furthermore, orthopedics has produced trailing rates of funded surgeon scientists and research dollars in the past decade compared to other surgical specialties [13]. Difficulty replenishing faculty members that are actively involved in research raises additional concerns about the present value and purpose of research in orthopedics [14]. Productive medical students and residents are more likely to match to a top-tier residency and fellowship program, respectively, and increasing numbers of students and trainees are participating in a research year [15]. There is no doubt that productivity in research is evidence of motivation; whether that motivation is genuine curiosity or to remain competitive in one of the most medical specialties is not known.

There are a number of limitations to our study. Our reported response rates were higher in our academic group than our community group, likely because this group is a self-selected group interested in research and supporting academic pursuits. Additionally, this cross-sectional study does not measure outcomes over time. Instead, our design allows for a larger subject inclusion for similar resources. Finally, while our survey was developed using published procedures for item development and study using a handbook for survey research in medical education [16], many questions are subjective measures and self-reporting standards that are subject to reporter biases. We also did not have access to individual resident data to validate some of the program/fellowship directors' attitudes. For example, we had individual program directors who reported that >50% of their trainees were not completing their research requirements prior to graduation, yet there are no reports of programs with a less than 50% graduation rate.

The disproportionate productivity in clinical studies only, whether quality or not, is also understandable. Preclinical studies are time-consuming and expensive compared to clinical studies that can readily source data from an institutional medical record or insurance database. Nevertheless, preclinical studies are foundational for future advancements in orthopedics. In the last five years, 75% of the grants awarded to the field of orthopedics by the National Institute of Health went to a nonclinical (PhD) investigator, and at least half of the grants were directed toward basic science. The marked agreement among program directors regarding the ideal focus of orthopedic research directly aligns with the apparent interests of the single largest source of healthcare funding in the US. Given the responsibility of directors to graduate the next generation of orthopedic surgeons, their concerns should not be ignored.


## Conclusions

Despite the apparent differences, orthopedic surgery program directors at academic and community programs alike agree that a greater emphasis on basic science research is needed. Academic programs have historically championed basic science research. With fewer concerns over resources and funding, these programs must allocate significantly more time for research if a resurgence in surgeon scientists and preclinical discovery is to be achieved.
