Background Data: Revision surgery for lumbar interbody cage migration is technically demanding.Cage related complication may lead to failure of fusion.Revision of such morbidity is associated with increased risk of permanent neurological insult.Purpose: To analyze the efficacy of posterior approach and iliac crest auto grafting technique in revision of migrated intervertebral cages.Study Design: Retrospective descriptive clinical case study.Patients and Methods: From January 2010 to January 2016, we operated 106 patients underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with single cage application per level for treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis.Of these, 12 patients experiencing cage subsidence and retropulsion.In subsidence, it was graded from 0 to III.Retropulsion was considered if the cage beyond the level of the posterior longitudinal line of the index two vertebrae.Patients were assessed pre-operatively for pain and clinical functional outcome by visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI), respectively.Patient with VAS score ≥5; at least 20% deterioration on ODI or with the superadded neurological deficit was considered candidates for revision surgery.Results: Cage migration incidence was 11.3%, with subsidence (6.7%), and retropulsion (4.6%) of all patients.The average time for subsidence was 3.3 months (range 2 to 6 months).Five patients with grade-II and III subsidence underwent revision surgery for foraminal decompression, augmenting fixation and adding postero-lateral iliac crest bone graft.Retropulsion was encountered in 4 patients and all needed revision surgery for cage retrieval and redo fusion.Grade-I subsidence could be treated conservatively.All surgically treated patients had a good result in VAS and ODI after a second surgery which maintained during follow up with P<0.05.Conclusion: Migration of posterior lumbar interbody fusion cage into the endplates or spinal canal is usually associated with patient dissatisfaction.Revision surgery indicated for cage retropulsion or high-grade subsidence.The posterior approach is technically demanding, safe, and effective for cage migration revision surgery.(2017ESJ141)

## Introduction

Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) is a standard surgical technique.Cloward in1940 was the first to describe PLIF. 28In 1988, Bagby was the first surgeon who useda cage for disc reconstruction in horses. 30In 1993 Brantigan and Steffee 6 published the first trial of spine fusion using cage.In the United States, more than 300,000 lumbar spine fusion are performed each year. 12ifferent cage designs (cylindrical, rectangular, banana, bullet) are available with different materials including; Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), carbon fiber reinforced PEEK, bioabsorbable polymers, or titanium). 11,20Cages act as strut to support the axial loading, restore disc space height, restore foraminal height which is indirectly decompress nerve root.Cage has surface ridges to give primary stability against migration.Cages have slots inside to be filled at index surgery with bone graft tohelp fusion, boneingrowthadd for cage stability. 28,20age related complication like subsidence of the PEEK cage inside the vertebral body may leads to failure of fusion and reduction of the intervertebral foraminal height. 20,32Retropulsion of the cage is more serious complication.It may lead to neural structures compression causing severe pain, motor weakness, cauda equine syndromeand permanent neurological damage.It is less frequent than subsidence and accounts for less than 1% of patients. 17,23evision surgery for cage migration is associated with increased risk of permanent neurological damage due to excessive scar tissue dissection and tethered root manipulation 13 Technical consideration for cage removal have been little discussed in the literature. 33Transdural, 33 anterior, 21 and or posterior approaches for cage removal have been used with considerable complications. 23,17his study aims to analyze safety and efficacy of posterior cage revision surgery and illustrating some technical tips to treat posterior lumbar interbody cage related complication.


## Patients and Methods


## Patient Population:

From January 2010 to January 2016, 106 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis underwent PLIF for their disabling back pain and leg pain after failure of 6 months of conservative treatment.Each patient had at least one or two segment fixation with clinical and radiological follow up for at least 12 months to assess fusion.All levels had single posterior lumbar interbody PEEK cage (Egy fix®, Mubarak Industrial Area, Menofia, Egypt).The intervertebral cage height ranged from 9 to 13 mm.Cages were filled with locally harvested autogenous bone graft at the initial index surgery.

Postoperatively and during the follow-up, 12 patients complained of construct related complication as (cage subsidence, retropulsion or impending retropulsion).Revision surgery was scheduled if the patient developed a serious neurological insult, construct malpositioning and or significant complaint related to the failed construct with failure of conservative treatment.


## Clinical Assessment:

Patients had pre-operative and postoperativeassessment by visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI), respectively.Postoperatively, patients were assessed clinically at: 1, 3, 6, 12 months, and every year thereafter.

Conservative treatment was considered unless the patient had VAS score ≥5; at least 20% deterioration on ODI. 5 Radiological Assessment: Plain X rays used to assess construct integrity and it was done at: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months postoperatively.On lateral plain X-ray film, subsidence was considered if the cage went through the lower endplate as follow: rgade-0, 0-24%; grade-I, 25-49%, grade-II, 50-74%, and grade-III, 75-100% collapse of the index level.Grades-0 and I were considered low-grade while Grades-II and III were considered high-grade subsidence. 18etropulsion was considered if the cage was beyond the level of the posterior longitudinal line of the index two vertebrae. 23,17hroughout the follow-up, CT scan was taken on demand or after one year to verify implant position and bony fusion.Fusion was considered if bridging bone appeared between the two adjacent vertebras, or through and around the cage, together with absence of radiolucent line around the cage more. 18Magnetic Resonance Imaging used to assess the neural element compression, adjacent disc pathology and any suspected soft tissue pathology.Operative Notes: Under general anesthesia, patient positioned prone with free abdomen to decrease intraoperative epidural venous bleeding.Laminectomy was done then deep soft tissue dissection and neurolysis was done.Dissection started from healthy to scared tissue.Laminectomy and/or medial facetectomy was done till we reach a safe corridor to the pathological disc and cage.Intraoperative imaging and microscope for localization and dissection of migrated implant is recommended.The screw caps and the titanium rods were removed.Screws were examined for loosening with replacement of loose one by longer, larger diameter screw.We packed the revised screw track by harvested cortico-cancellous local autograft and or iliac crest autograft.Construct augmentation by adding more screws were performed if needed.

Cages with impending retropulsion or retropulsion: the detailed operative technique was described in (Figure 1).During surgery, when the dura and nerve root became more mobile, we did a gradual guided distraction of the transpedicular screw.After successful cage removal, adequate cage size packed with iliac crest cancellous bone autograft was placed.Before the cage insertion, bone ships anterior to the cage were packed as a fusion enhancing procedure.(Figure 2) If the disc space was roomy, bear shaped or wider posteriorly than anteriorly a well impacted anteriorly located autologous cortico-cancellous local and or iliac crest bone graft was inserted instead of the cage followed by posterior applied segmental compression aiming for bony fusion.(Figure 3)

Cage subsidence that mandated surgery: foraminal decompression was done.Construct was re-stabilized by replacing any loose screw, and or adding more anchorage points.Fusion enhancement by iliac crests autologous bone graft application posterolateral over the Inter-transverse ligament. 4Figure 4)

Wound was closed in layers.The suction drain was inserted after proper hemostasis.


## Statistical Analysis:

Statistical analysis was performed by Statistical Package for Social Science SPSS (version 20, Chicago, Inc.).Parametric data for each variable was presented in Mean±SD.Categorical numeric data were analyzed using chi-square test, with a level of significance of P<0.05.


## Results

Hundred and six patients underwent PLIF for treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis, 12 patientshad implant related complications either cage subsidence or retropulsion.The incidence of cage migration was 11.3%.There were 4 male and 8 females with an average age of 46±18.3(Range 28 to 65) years.The average follows up was 19.6±10.4months (Range, 9 to 34 months).(Table 1)

Subsidence was reported in 8 patients (7.5%).The average time for subsidence to occur was 3.3 months (Range 2 to 6 months).Six patients experienced cage subsidence at L4/5 and two at L5/S1.All patients presented with sudden onset back pain with or without radicular pain.Subsidence grades were described in table 1. Subsidence occurred in the lower end plate in 62.50% of patients, and 37.5% involved both sides.Three patients with grade-I subsidence treated conservatively, one of them associated with mild subclinical infection managed conservatively by brace and antibiotics with improvement of the patient symptoms at follow up.Five patients (62.5%) (Three grade-II subsidence and two grade-III subsidence) had a surgical intervention.These five patients underwent foraminal decompression and posterolateral auto graft fusion, plus construct revision in three of them.

Retropulsion was reported in four patients, 3 patients at L4/5 (2.8).The retropulsion was detected in 1.82 months (Range, 1-3 months).Migrated cage was retrieved in all patients; one patient had construct augmentation by adding anchorage points in adjacent level.Fusion was augmented by interbody iliac crest bone graft application in all 4 patients.In two patients larger cage insertion filled with iliac crest bone graft was applied.

The mean operative time was 190.6±30.2min and mean blood loss was 740.4±102.4ml.One patient had postoperative superficial infection managed by debridement and antibiotic.Another patient had CSF leakage managed conservatively, with mild nonspecific radicular pain from mild arachnoiditis.

The average postoperative hospital stay was 2.6±3.2days.VAS and ODI after the second surgery and during one year follow up showed statistically significant improvement as shown in Table 2

## Discussion

Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) is a surgical treatment option in degenerative spondylolisthesis.Cage related complications like subsidence and migrationare not uncommon.Clinically symptomatic cage migration into the endplates or spinal canal is a devastating cause of failed back surgery. 1 When lumbar cage subsidence occurs there are many concerns about recurrence of foraminal stenosis and sagittal malalignement. 18age retropulsion leads to compression of the neural structures with progressive back pain and sciatica. 23,33age Subsidence: Cage subsidence is debatable issue, some surgeons consider it as an expected scenario, 16,18,20 while others consider it as a complication.18 Such statement could be explained by the fact that lowgrade subsidence may be completely asymptomatic and may enhance interbody bony fusion while high-grade subsidence are symptomatic and may require reoperation.Marchiet et al, 18 suggested that low-grade subsidence can stabilize by time with improved surgical outcome.Furthermore, they reported bony fusion in grade-III subsidence without revision surgery.In this study, we had five from eight patients required revision surgery with foraminal decompression and fusion enhancement by inter-transverse bone graft application.

Segmental lordosis is usually maintained by different cage designs 14 or by anterior application of the lumbar cage that distract more the anterior disc space. 8Hence, anterior subsidence is usually associated with progressive spinal deformity, posterior one is much related to the risk of stenosis. 9,18In this study, as with others, subsidence occurred in the first three months. 8,16It is rarely that subsidence can occur after 6 months. 27tudies reported many risk factors for subsidence including osteoporosis, multilevel fusion, older age, female sex, and obesity. 15,18Cage subsidence occurs more frequently at L5/S1 and less in L4/5. 9L5/S1 and then L4/5 have a different disc angle compared with other levels.In addition, pedicle fixation at L5/S1 level showed less rigid screw construct. 17,23,33owever, in this study, we reported 6 patients at L4/5 and 2 at L5/S1 as most of patients was degenerative spondylolisthesis at L4/5.In this study, one patient had subsidence due to mild subclinical infection.We believe that subsidence in most of our patients are due to extensive endplate curettage and preparation .To prevent subsidence, it is recommended to avoid extensive rigorous end plate preparation that may expose weak subchondral bone at the cage bed. 24,18,27,10Additionally, many studies 25,31 have found the lumbar cage subsidence was attributed to small cage with smaller footprints.


## Retropulsion:

In a large study by Kimura et al, 17 included 1070 patients, they found that cage migration occurred in less than 1%.Many factors had been discussed for cage retropulsion; obesity, osteoporosis, old age were considered patient related factors for cage migration. 23,34Due to the cage design, patient with higher posterior disc height as in this study had been suggested as a causative factor for cage migration and this was suggested in other case series. 2 Construct loosening as in one of our case series, low-grade infection, local segmental kyphosis and failure to compress the posterior anchorage points after cage application at the index surgery all are possible causes of retropulsion.Rectangular PEEK cage, bullet shaped cage, closed box cage, small size cage, and technical faults considered as cage related factors for migration. 12,7,23,34The PLIF technique itself was considered as a factor for retropulsion.In this study, we consider midline cage location may be responsible for cage migration. 1Laminectomy and medial facetectomy for PLIF were considered a migration factors. 7,23Multilevel fusion has increased risk for retropulsion. 2Two cages insertion in one level can lead to migration of one cage due to instability created from unequal stresses in such level. 23hrough our study we believe that bad cage design and midline cage insertion attribute to difficulties in posterior compression at index surgery.This helped the occurrence of retropulsion or impending retropulsion with focal segmental kyphosis.

In this study, the average postoperative hospital stay was 2.6±3.2days, where it was reported 5.75±1.7 days in other study. 23Patients in this study were allowed to move with bracing and to do mild exercise.Early mobility and exercise enhance local circulation, promote fusion, and may prevent cage migration. 10,17,19,23,27,33urgery: Few small cases series reported for cage migration. 3,8,10,17,33However, revision surgery for cage subsidence and retropulsion is technically demanding.Many approaches had been used for removal of cages with their relative risk. 17,23,33,19n this case series, posterior revision surgery was planned.We recommend the use of magnifying loop or microscope for better visualization in such surgeries.

In the posterior approach, neural mobilization and adhesolysis carrying a risk of leg pain or nerve palsy. 7oki et al, 3 reported that cage removal in TLIF is less difficult than PLIF as the cage tends to be found more laterally.Bleeding, infection, the myofascial pain was reported from 15 to 30% of patients. 2,19ue to its difficulties, transdural removal of the cage was suggested by Zaidi et al, 33 with good recovery.

In this study, we tried to illustrate the technical tips and method of safe retrieval and removal of the posteriorly migrated PLIF cage.The authors recommend that after cage insertion, posterior compression should be applied to prevent cage migration and stabilize the operated lumbar segment in better lordosis.

In the anterior approach, surgery is demanding with risk of approach-related complications.Glassman et al, 13 described a successful approach for removal of an anterior cage with no complication.However, they performed a partial vertebral resection.Nguyen et al, 21 reported a series of 13 patients with cage migration.They described the removal of cages through an anterior approach with 71% complication rate.They reported 57% vascular injury and one death from multiple venous injuries.Oh et al, 22 reported deterioration after anterior removal of the cage, and posterior approach was used for revision of pedicle screw insertion and root decompression.Other reported complication including; abdominal muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, and retrograde ejaculation. 23,13,21n lateral approach, although it carries access through a healthy non-operated corridor, it carries the possibility of injury to the lumbar plexus in the psoas muscle. 22Neurophysiologic monitoring is essential to avoid such complication.Posteriorly located cages carry the risk of dural tear with cerebrospinal fluid CSF leak.It carries a risk of vascular injuries. 19Comparable to other approaches, L5-S1 cage istechnically difficult for removal through lateral approach due to high riding iliac crest. 19


## Limitations:

The study had some limitation.Small number of patients, Retrospective nature of the study and no long term follow up for our patients.


## Conclusion

Migration of posterior lumbar interbody fusion cage into the endplates or spinal canal is usually associated with patient dissatisfaction.Revision surgery indicated for cage retropulsion or high-grade subsidence.The posterior approach is technically demanding, safe, and effective for cage migration revision surgery.
