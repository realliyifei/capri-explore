(p0.0) Gout is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies of adults with gout found that 24% had CKD stage 3 or greater (95% CI: 19, 28%) [1]. The prevalence of gout also increases as renal function declines, as demonstrated by a study of an agestandardized prevalence of gout of 2.9% among adults with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) !90 ml/min and 24% among those with eGFR <60 ml/min [2]. This reciprocal increase is explained by the fact that two-thirds of urate excretion occurs through the kidneys and by the detrimental effects of hyperuricaemia on the kidneys, from stimulation of oxidative stress and activation of the renin-angiotensin system to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis [3].

(p0.1) Clinicians managing gout need to be mindful of how therapies for gout might influence or be influenced by kidney function. For instance, oxypurinol (the active metabolite of allopurinol) is excreted by the kidneys, resulting in higher plasma oxypurinol concentrations as kidney function declines. Uricosuric drugs also depend on renal filtration to provide their effect through the blockage of ion transporters in the renal tubules; therefore, they lose efficacy in advanced kidney disease. Treatment of gout is frequently suboptimal, and this is particularly so in people with concomitant CKD, primarily owing to concerns over adverse effects and efficacy of medications used in the management of gout [4]. For example, it is common practice to limit the allopurinol dose based on creatinine clearance (CrCl), although this approach results in <50% of patients reaching the serum urate (SU) target. Such adherence to renal-based dosing has never been proved to reduce the risk of severe adverse reactions to allopurinol, and there is increasing evidence that allopurinol can be increased safely beyond 'renal-based doses' in patients with CKD [5,6]. Similar uncertainties exist for most urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) in gout.

(p10.0) The main characteristics of the 10 studies that reported febuxostat efficacy based on renal function are summarized in Table 1. There were only three RCTs [13,14,30]. Although APEX (Allopurinol Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Study of Febuxostat) and CONFIRMS were already fully described in Table 1, the study by Chohan et al. [18] was included for adding partial data from the FACT (Febuxostat Versus Allopurinol Controlled Trial) stratified by renal function. There was one case report of a patient on dialysis [28]. The 10 studies included >2700 subjects with gout using febuxostat, with !920 of them having eGFR of <60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . Five additional studies included [57][58][59][60][61] reported supplementary analysis on data from studies already described.
