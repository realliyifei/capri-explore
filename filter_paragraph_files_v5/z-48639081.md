## (s15) Influence of magnesium
Number of References: 2

(p15.0) Mg is one of the major elements added to Al to improve mechanical properties by solid solution strengthening -and can be found in 5xxx alloys, as well as 2xxx, 3xxx, 6xxx and 7xxx commercial alloys. Mg can stabilize GP zones, has a high solubility in Al and decreases the alloy density. Muller and Galvele showed that Mg when present in solid solution does not have a significant effect on the pitting corrosion of Al which can be understood on the basis of standard potentials of Al and Mg (Muller and Galvele 1977). Moreover, Mg decreases the rate of the cathodic reaction when present in solid solution, increasing corrosion resistance, which may appear counterintuitive, but is rather obvious (as Mg has a very low exchange current density and hence retards the cathodic reaction). In contrast, excess amounts of Mg in the alloy or a long term exposure to elevated temperature will cause the precipitation of either Al 8
