(p10.0) Eleven articles were identified that examined PrU risk assessment scales in ICUs. Several risk assessment instruments have been developed for early screening of patients at higher risk of developing PrU in the ICU. Table 3 provides a summary of the year of publication, setting, population, study method, scale, cut-off point, sensitivity and results of each study. Table 4 provides background information and overviews of each risk assessment scale used in ICU including; items of assessment, score and total score, and determination of 'at risk' category.  [27] . Lewicki and associates in a descriptive study in 337 cardiothoracic ICU patients examined the sensitivity and specificity of the Braden scale using different cut-off points at various days of hospitalization to determine the optimal cut-off point in a cardiac surgical population. The author recommended that several cut-off scores corresponding with day of hospitalization exist in populations whose conditions change greatly over the course of their hospital stay. Ongoing assessment is always required as the clinical status of patients is liable to change [28] .
