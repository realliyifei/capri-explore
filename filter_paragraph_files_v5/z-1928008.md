(p0.0) Urine odour analysis by sensorial techniques, i.e., smelling, is maybe one of the most antique methods for the detection of specific pathologies. As a matter of fact, several pathological processes, such as infection and endogenous metabolic disorders, can affect human body odours [1]. Already in sensors and pattern recognition was first reported by Persaud and Dodd [38], electronic noses and their applications have been studied by several researchers throughout the world. Different studies concern the application of electronic noses in the food industry [39,40], and in recent years also developments in the environmental sector have become an issue of increasing interest [41].

(p0.1) One particularly interesting field of application for this technology is medical diagnostics. Even though for this extremely delicate purpose, particular attention should be given to the electronic noses limitations and all the critical aspects associated with their use [42]. Here, we decided review electronic nose studies and applications in the specific field of medical diagnosis based on the analysis of urine odour. Despite the variety of works regarding more generically biomedical applications of electronic noses [43,44], the scientific literature regarding specifically their utilization for the analysis of urine samples is not so huge, for this reason it was possible to make an exhaustive inspection among all the research papers regarding this particular issue, considering a timeframe of publication between 1997 and 2015. The aim of this paper is therefore to provide a broad overview of the state of the art and thus enhance future developments in this specific field.
