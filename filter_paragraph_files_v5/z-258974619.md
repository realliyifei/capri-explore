(p21.0) Maximum likelihood may be used in EFA, and is generally used in finite mixture models in nutritional epidemiology.However, in some applications and especially for the EFA, in order to regularize the factor loadings, priors or penalties are used to induce sparsity [76,15,40].This might be particularly interesting in the identification of a posteriori dietary patterns.Sparse factor loadings can be used to identify specific subsets of nutrients and interpret them as interacting subsets, helping elucidate the name chosen for a dietary pattern.In contrast to the frequentist approach, Bayesian methods model sparsity through the introduction of shrinkage and sparse priors on EFA.Sparse latent factor models therefore exploit sparsity-inducing priors as an integral part of the identification of dietary patterns.In the Bayesian approach to sparsity, two main priors have been widely used and developed.

(p21.1) The first one is the Bayesian LASSO prior, introduced by Park and Casella (2008) [95], and developed in different settings [15,100].Based on the LASSO penalty of Tibshirani (1996) [121], the Bayesian LASSO prior is a conditional Laplace prior for the loadings Î» pj with p = 1, . . ., P variables and j = 1, . . ., J factors
