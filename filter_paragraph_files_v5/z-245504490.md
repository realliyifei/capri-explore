(p7.0) Overall, 15 studies reported data on psoriasis and/or nail psoriasis (Fig. 2). Three focused their analyses on this clinical manifestation, comparing them among patients with PsA and RA; all three studies concluded that psoriasis and/or nail psoriasis occurred exclusively in patients with PsA vs. RA (Table 3) [23,54,59]. Of patients initially diagnosed with early seronegative RA, 25% were reclassified as having early PsA after presenting with cutaneous or nail psoriasis upon further rheumatology-dermatology evaluation [23]. One patient initially presented with seronegative oligoarthritis, and a diagnosis of PsA was suspected because of a family history of psoriasis; this patient was then formally diagnosed with PsA with the subsequent development of skin lesions [24].
