(p13.0) Taken together, the eleven included reviews reported data from 179 unique primary HIIT: high-intensity interval training; CON: nonexercise control; MICT: moderate-intensity continuous training; EX-CON: exercising control; SIT: sprint interval training; VO 2 max: maximal oxygen uptake; T1: 60-70% VO 2 max; T2: 80-92.5% VO 2 max; T3: 100-250% VO 2 max; HRmax: maximal heart rate; HRR: heart rate reserve; Vmax: maximal velocity at VO 2 max; vVO2max : velocity at VO 2 max; Pmax: peak watt work load; GET: gas exchange threshold; pVO 2 max: maximal aerobic power; MAS: maximal aerobic speed; WRmax: work rate at VO 2 max; ∆LT: change between lactate threshold VO2max; VO 2 peak: peak oxygen uptake; VLT: velocity at lactate threshold; Wmax: maximal power output; PPO: peak power output; maximal at resistance of %BM: 30 second all-out effort relative to % body mass; and HIIE: combination of HIIT and SIT training effects on VO 2 max studies. However, further investigation shows the limitation of current systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, with an average of only 23 ± 10 studies per review, which highlights the need for this current overview. e findings of this overview show that LIT and HIT are both effective at increasing VO 2 max in both young and old, healthy, and sedentary, adults; however, some methodological considerations require attention on the interpretation of these findings. Evidence from the meta-analyses that directly compared LIT versus HIT protocols on VO 2 max was, ostensibly, reported as either trivial or inconclusive. ree out of the six included meta-analyses reported small/moderate beneficial effects of HIT over LIT (α < 0.05) [20,23,27]. However, two of these reviews reported "substantial" heterogeneity (I 2 >0.75) [28], small-study bias (p < 0.10) [29], a relatively small pooled sample size (i.e., <1,000 participants), had a high degree of overlap (CCA � 11%) and reported several moderators (e.g., baseline fitness levels, age, HIT variables [e.g., volume, frequency, and duration]), which likely affected results. All three reviews identified that, compared to LIT, HIT generally elicited a greater increase in VO 2 max in older and less fit populations, and/or when longinterval (2 to 4 minutes of work/bout), high-volume (15minute work/session), and moderate/long-duration HIT protocols (>4 weeks) were prescribed [20,23,27]. Furthermore, several primary studies within these reviews concluded that HIT had greater beneficial effects for older participants, whereas LIT showed greater effects for participants with lower baseline fitness [19,21,24]. erefore, it is difficult to conduct a crude comparisons between LIT and HIT, where a more nuanced approach is required (i.e., not all populations respond the same nor are all HIT protocols consistent, therefore giving disparate responses because of other training parameters, rather than intensity per se).
