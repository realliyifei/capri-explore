(p0.0) The recent emergence of novel therapies has expanded the tools and options for clinicians to treat migraine [1]. Before the introduction of monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway in 2018 [2], it had been > 25 years since sumatriptan, a therapy developed specifically for the acute treatment of migraine, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [3], and a decade since FDA approval of a preventive medication (onabotulinumtoxinA) for chronic migraine (CM) [4]. Further, prior to the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway, all medications used for preventive treatment of migraine had been initially approved for other indications [1].

(p0.1) The purpose of this review is to highlight the burden of migraine and unmet need in appropriate migraine management, describe recent advances in preventive migraine therapies, and highlight key takeaways from the most recent migraine management consensus statement [5] to provide pharmacists with an overview of the current expert opinion on the management of migraine. The information in this review is applicable to pharmacists in all pharmacy settings, such as community, ambulatory care, specialty, and clinical pharmacists. Nonetheless, the information may be more readily incorporated in the practices of community and ambulatory pharmacists because migraine is primarily addressed as an outpatient.

## (s2) Unmet medical need in migraine

(p2.0) In addition to characterizing the population affected by severe migraine, the AMPP study illustrated the unmet medical need experienced by patients with migraine, with â‰ˆ 44% of people with migraine having never received a medical diagnosis [34]. Additionally, patients with a migraine diagnosis were shown to have extreme difficulty accessing both acute and preventive treatment [35,36]. An exploratory analysis from the AMPP study found that only 26% of the original EM cohort successfully overcame all three barriers (consultation, diagnosis, and treatment) [35]. Data from patients with CM suggest even more challenges, with the Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes Study (CaMEO) reporting < 5% of patients with CM successfully traversed the same three barriers, with difficulties particularly in seeking a consultation and receiving an accurate diagnosis of CM [36]. Furthermore, of those who consulted a healthcare professional and were accurately diagnosed, less than half received preventive and acute treatment [36]. More recent data confirm migraine remains underdiagnosed and undertreated [29].

(p5.0) The recent approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway for prevention of migraine in adults has expanded and improved available options for migraine treatment. CGRP, a vasodilatory neuropeptide with multiple sites of action, has been identified as a key player in migraine pathophysiology through its involvement in nociception and sensitization of peripheral and central neurons in the trigeminovascular system [60]. CGRP is also associated with neurogenic inflammation and pronociceptive activity [61]. CGRP levels in the jugular venous blood are elevated in patients with migraine, increase during migraine attacks, and can induce migraine-like headaches in people susceptible to migraine [60,62,63]. Sumatriptan has been shown to normalize plasma CGRP levels, reinforcing the role of CGRP in migraine [64].
## (s6) Migraine treatment guidelines from the AHS and AAN

(p6.0) The leading organizations in the US for headache treatment and management are the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and AHS. In 2000, these two organizations were joined by five other national organizations to form the US Headache Consortium, which developed the first consensus guidelines for acute treatment and prevention of migraine [57]. Key to the management of migraine is accurate diagnosis and the subsequent education of patients about their condition and treatment, including establishing realistic treatment expectations, and encouraging patients to identify and avoid migraine triggers [57]. For acute treatment, these early guidelines recommended treating attacks promptly with an effective acute migraine-specific treatment, selecting a non-oral medication with patients presenting with migraine associated with severe nausea and vomiting, identifying a self-administered "rescue" medication for use if the initial acute medication was ineffective. To prevent MOH, the use of acute therapy for > 2 headache days per week was cautioned against [57]. For preventive treatment, it was recommended to use medications with the best evidence while taking comorbidities into account, initiate therapy at the lowest effective dose, give each drug an adequate (2-3 month) trial, monitor treatment response through a headache diary, and to consider the role of concurrent non-pharmacologic treatment [57]. These overarching treatment principles remain valid today and underpin current guidelines.
