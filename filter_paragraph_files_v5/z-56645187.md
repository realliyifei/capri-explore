(p3.0) In the three studies using the oxidative stress model, Jung et al. found that idesolide extract protected muscle cells from oxidative stress by promoting the activation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the cells [42]. HSP70 protects cells from a number of apoptotic stimuli, including oxidative stress and is significantly downregulated in various models of skeletal muscle atrophy [52]. They also found the same effects when sauchinone (root of Saururus chinensis) was used as the mode of treatment [44].

(p3.1) In Choe YH., isorhamnetin (ISO) extract was treated to hydrogen peroxide-(H2O2-) induced oxidation damaged muscle cells. In general, H2O2 causes cell apoptosis with mitochondrial damage and ROS generation by upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 [53]. The ISO extract inhibited the apoptosis by the restoration of Bax, Bcl-2 proteins, and decreasing of caspase-9 and caspase-3. In addition, the ISO activated the antioxidant protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby suppressing oxidative stress [47].
