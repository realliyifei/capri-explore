## (s0) Introduction
Number of References: 8

(p0.0) In 1897, Sir George Fredrick Still described 22 children, 12 of whom had a unique constellation of symptoms that included chronic arthritis, adenopathy, splenomegaly, and fevers [1]. Initially bearing his name, and later known by other names (systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile chronic arthritis), this entity is now known as systemic arthritis [2]. To allow for improved identification and research the International League of Associations of Rheumatology (ILAR) proposed a classification for JIA [2,3]. To fulfill the criteria for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) a child must be under 16 years of age and have "arthritis in one or more joints with or preceded by fever of at least 2 weeks' duration that is documented to be daily ("quotidian") for at least 3 days and accompanied by one or more of the following: (1) evanescent (nonfixed) erythematous rash, (2) generalized lymph node enlargement, (3) hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, (4) serositis" [3]. Exclusions include "(a) psoriasis or a history of psoriasis in the patient or a first-degree relative, (b) arthritis in an HLA-B27 positive male beginning after the 6th birthday, (c) ankylosing spondylitis, enthesitis-related arthritis, sacroiliitis with inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, or acute anterior uveitis, or a history of one of these disorders in a first-degree relative, (d) the presence of IgM rheumatoid factor on at least 2 occasions at least 3 months apart" [3]. Despite being included under the inclusive umbrella of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), it is likely that sJIA is a different disease, for it appears to be unlike the other forms of JIA both in clinical presentation and its pathogenesis [4] (refer to section under pathogenesis). In the following sections we will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, genetics, clinical manifestations, complications, therapy, prognosis, and outcome of sJIA.
## (s1) Pathogenesis and Genetics
Number of References: 9

(p1.0) Cytokine dysregulation is seen in sJIA. While interferon γ levels are decreased, proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, Eselectin, and intracellular adhesion molecules levels are elevated in sJIA [16][17][18][19][20][21]. Recently, the role of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in sJIA received attention. Excess IL-1β can result in fever, anorexia, pain hypersensitivity, joint destruction, vasculitis, and thrombosis [22]; its dysregulation can lead to the clinical and laboratory findings of sJIA. In Pascual et al.'s study, culturing healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells with serum of sJIA patients caused an increase in IL-1 secretion; an increased production of IL-1β protein from mononuclear cells of active sJIA patients was also seen [23]. IL-1β appears to have a pivotal role and may be responsible for the elevation in IL-6 [23].
## (s2) Features at Presentation
Number of References: 10

(p2.0) The most common presenting feature is fever, followed by arthritis and rash. Less frequent are lymphadenopathy, pericarditis, and hepatosplenomegaly [5,58]. Most patients present with laboratory findings indicative of inflammation: elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP [5,58], leuko-and thrombocytosis, and elevation in liver transaminases, as well as anemia [5]. Elevation of D-dimers [5,59], ferritin, and aldolase [5] is seen.

(p2.1) Some patients' initial presentation of sJIA is that of lifethreatening MAS (discussed further under complications). The clinical findings are very similar to those of both sJIA and sepsis, with unremitting fever ≥ 38 • C, central nervous system manifestations, hemorrhage, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, serositis, and myocarditis [60]. The laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, elevated liver enzymes, leukocytosis, normal or decreased ESR, hypofibrinogenemia, and hypertriglyceridemia [61].
## (s3) Clinical Manifestations
Number of References: 15

(p3.0) 6.1. Fever. Fever is the most common symptom at time of initial presentation. According to Behrens et al., 98% of patients present with fever [5], and in a cohort study from the United Kingdom, France, and Spain, 100% of patients presented with fever (this was an inclusion criteria) [58]. Classically, it has been described as a quotidian fever that spikes to greater than 39 • C once or twice daily, typically occurring in the evening [8,[62][63][64]. Although the quotidian pattern is one of the ILAR criteria for diagnosis of sJIA, Behrens et al.'s study showed different patterns. The classic pattern is only seen in 37% of the patients during initial presentation; others exhibit morning fevers (12%), bi-daily fevers (15%), intermittent fevers (27%), and unremitting fevers (5%) [5], as well as not reaching 39 • C [5,62]. In addition to the fevers, some children rapidly defervesce and attain subnormal temperatures [8,64,65]. While the child is febrile, other symptoms such as arthritis, rash or serositis can worsen and cause significant disturbance of daily life; however, once the child has defervesced, it is not unusual to see a resumption of regular activities [8,62,66].
## (s5) Lymphadenopathy.
Number of References: 10

(p5.0) Generalized lymphadenopathy is a common finding [8,65]. In Behrens et al., 31% of the patients had initial presentation of lymphadenopathy [5]; in Modesto et al., 24% out of the good prognosis group and 51% of the bad prognosis group presented with lymphadenopathy [58]. The lymphadenopathy consists of painless rubbery mobile nodes and can be found in epitrochlear and axillary nodes [8,65]; at times it can appear so striking that neoplasm may be suspected [84]. In comparison, mesenteric adenitis can be painful [8], and in the past it has led to operative interventions on children who were misdiagnosed with a surgical abdomen [65]. On radiographic studies, para-aortic adenopathy can be identified, and histologically, reactive changes are noted in the nodes [8].
## (s7) Other Manifestations.
Number of References: 6

(p7.0) Although rare, central nervous system manifestations such as seizures, meningismus, as well as irritability and decreased level of consciousness were previously described [92]. Ocular manifestations can be seen in sJIA, and uveitis is one of the complications [93]. A case report by Ishihara et al. described a patient with sJIA who developed bilateral panuveitis 3 years after her initial presentation [93]. In addition, Brown's syndrome (restricted movement of the superior oblique tendon) was seen in 3 children and reported in two case reports [94,95]. Although nasal septum perforation is a complication of rheumatic illness, it was described in only 3 children with sJIA in a case series [96].
## (s9) Complications
Number of References: 15

(p9.0) 8.1. Amyloidosis. Serum amyloid A is an acute phase reactant which is elevated with inflammatory processes. It is the precursor for serum amyloid A protein [104,105]. Amyloidosis is one of the most severe complications of sJIA. For unknown reasons, amyloidosis tends to be very rare in North America and yet affects a larger percentage of individuals in the UK and Turkey (7.4% and 16%, resp.) [106,107]. Deposition of the protein has an effect on vital organs such as the kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and heart [105]. Upon biopsy of rectal mucosa, subcutaneous fat, gum, or kidney, amyloidosis can be histologically recognized by using Congo red stain, which reveals eosinophilic deposition; when employing polarized light, the characteristic apple-green birefringence surfaces [105,108,109]. The first clinical sign of amyloidosis is proteinuria, but it is often missed and nephrotic syndrome is seen [8,105]. Other symptoms that may suggest amyloidosis are: hypertension, hepatospenomegaly, and abdominal pain [8,105]. Unless the inflammatory process of sJIA is successfully suppressed and amyloidosis reverses, death from progressive renal failure in those children with amyloidosis can result [8,105]. Immonen et al. examined the long-term outcome of 24 patients with amyloidosis; sJIA was seen in 11/24 patients (46%). The overall 5 year survival rate was 88%, and 10-year survival rate was 75%. Out of the 24 patients with all subclasses of JIA, 10 died. Although the mortality for the different types of JIA was not specified, overall, a higher mortality was seen in patients who were treated solely with corticosteroids, while those who were treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or cytotoxics had a better survival (P = 0.001) [110].
## (s12) Corticosteroids and Cyclophosphamide.
Number of References: 7

(p12.0) Although not considered to be disease modifying, systemic corticosteroids are often used when patients experience a preponderance of systemic features [135]. Kimura et al. studied the efficacy and side effects of high-dose alternate day prednisone and concluded that it was a valuable therapy with minimal adverse reactions [146].

(p12.1) Intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone is also useful in treating sJIA patients. In Adebajo and Hall's study, pulse steroids (30 mg/kg with a maximum of 1 g) was given to sJIA patients: 55% of the patients had full resolution of systemic manifestations, and 45% of the patients had reduction in arthritis; furthermore, 16% of the patients obtained remission [147]. Prolonged use of corticosteroids in children has multiple significant adverse reactions such as inhibition of growth, immunosuppression, striae, delayed puberty, osteoporosis, cushingoid habitus, myopathy, cataracts, hypertension, psychologic effects, and others, all of which can immensely affect the pediatric population [148][149][150][151]. Because of the considerable undesirable effects of corticosteroids, switching to an effective steroid sparing agent is critical in these patients.
## (s13) Tocilizumab.
Number of References: 10

(p13.0) Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, targeting both membrane bound and soluble IL-6 receptors [165]. By binding to these receptors, signal transduction through glycoprotein 130 is inhibited [166]. In 2003, Yokota reported the first encouraging use of IL-6 inhibition in children [166]. In 2005, a phase II trial with tocilizumab showed JIA 30%, 50%, and 70% improvement according to a core set of response variables in 10/11 (90.9%), 10/11 (90.9%), and 7/11 (63.6%) patients, respectively [167]. This definition of improvement was based upon the ACR Pediatric (ACR Pedi) 30 criteria, alternatively known as JRA, JIA, or Giannini's criteria of improvement [130,168,169]. It is an outcome measure for improvement defined as the following: a 30% improvement of at least 3 out of the following 6 core variables and no more than 30% worsening in one of them: (1) physician global assessment of disease activity; (2) parent/patient global assessment of overall well-being (each scored on a 10 cm visual analog scale); (3) functional ability; (4) number of joints with active arthritis; (5) number of joints with limited range of motion, (6) ESR [170]. Similarly additional outcome measures for improvement were later extrapolated: ACR pedi 50, 70, and 90, using the same guidelines as for the ACR Pedi 30 but defining a 50%, 70%, and 90% improvement in 3 of the 6 variables respectively, with no more than a 30% worsening in one variable [168,169].
## (s14) Abatacept.
Number of References: 4

(p14.0) Abatacept is a fusion protein that blocks the CD80 or CD86 interaction with CD28, which alters the costimulatory signal, thus inhibiting T-cell activation [175]. In 2008, a study by Ruperto et al. showed ACR Pedi 30% or more improvement in 65% of the systemic arthritis group, but the study excluded children with active systemic manifestations for the preceding 6 months [168]. In Ruperto et al.'s long-term extension, abatacept was again reported to have good response rate; the ACR Pedi 30, 50, 70, 90 and inactive disease response rate in patients with sJIA without systemic manifestations were 88%, 88%, 63%, 13%, and 25% correspondingly [176]. In a later report that year, Ruperto et al. discerned improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in JIA patients treated with abatacept (in which about 20% of the patients that were studied had sJIA) [177].
## (s16) Antitumor Necrosis Factors Antibodies (Anti-TNF).
Number of References: 20

(p16.0) There are three different types of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies: etanercept: a soluble TNFα receptor [169,179,180], Infliximab: a chimeric monoclonal TNFα antibody, and Adalimumab: a humanized monoclonal antibody.

(p16.1) The results from Lovell et al.'s 2000 study comparing sJIA patients' flare rate between placebo and etanercept therapy were encouraging, with 7/8 (88%) patients on placebo having a flare, and 4/9 (44%) of those on etanercept having a flare (statistically significant P < 0.001) [181]. Several later studies show that patients with sJIA appear to have only partial response to anti-TNF agents [128][129][130][131][132].

(p16.2) In 2003 Lovell et al. published interim results from an ongoing multicenter study examining etanercept, and reported improvement rates in JRA (30%, 50% and 70%). In the per protocol group at the end of the 2nd year, 30% improvement was seen in 10/12 patients (83%), 50% improvement was seen in 9/12 patients (75%), and 70% improvement was seen in 8/12 patients (67%); in their modified intent-to-treat group (which included the patients who discontinued therapy) 30% improvement was seen in 10/17 patients (59%), 50% improvement was seen in 9/17 patients (53%), and 70% improvement was seen in 8/17 patients (47%) [169]. In Horneff et al.'s 2004 study, a lower efficacy was seen in sJIA patients, where Giannini's criteria of 30%, 50%, and 70% improvement was seen in 48%, 33%, and 11% of the patients, respectively, after 1 month of treatment with etanercept, and after 3 months of treatment, improvement was seen in 63%, 39%, and 24% [130]. In Kimura et al.'s 2005 study examining etanercept therapy, 37/82 (45%) patients had poor response (<30% improvement), 7/82 (9%) had a fair response (30-<50% improvement), 11/82 (13%) had a good response (50-<70% improvement), and 27/82 (33%) had an excellent response (>70% improvement), where the response was defined as a percentage decrease from baseline of the following: steroid dose, count of actively involved joints, inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, or platelet count), and physician global assessment of disease activity score, rather than the ACR pedi response criteria [131]. In Russo and Katsicas' 2009 study, patients were treated initially with etanercept, but if improvement was not seen, patients were switched to therapy with either infliximab or adalimumab. The ACR pedi 30, 50, 70, and 90 criteria were used to assess clinical improvement and were seen in 35 (78%), 28 (62%), 21 (47%), and 14 (31%) of patients, respectively [132]. See Table 2. In Quartier et al.'s 2003 study, it was recognized that in comparing the 30% improvement rate between sJIA and oligoarticular or polyarticular JIA, those with sJIA had a greater likelihood of not reaching the 30% improvement (with P values of 0.0002 and 0.0031, resp.). When comparing the 50 and 70% improvement rate, sJIA also had a significant risk of not attaining that improvement level in comparison with oligoarticular onset JIA but did not differ in risk value from polyarticular onset JIA [129].

(p16.3) In a 2003 Lovell et al.'s study it was reported that out of the 5 sJIA patients who withdrew from the study, 4 had suboptimal clinical response, and 1 had an adverse event [169]. In the 2006 extension study, it was reported that 19 patients entered the extension study, and only 6 patients stayed in the extension study for ≥4 years (3 of the 13 patients withdrew secondary to lack of efficacy) [179]. In the 2008 open-label extension it was reported that 19 patients had entered the trial, but only 5 entered the 8th year [128], In Horneff et al.'s 2004 study, 17 of the 66 sJIA patients enrolled withdrew from the trial, where inefficacy of therapy was the reason for discontinuation in 14 out of the 17 patients, adverse effects were seen in 2 patients and 1 patient withdrew for other reasons [130]. In Kimura et al.'s 2005 study, disease flares were seen in 37/82 patients (45%) in all levels of therapeutic response; however, they were more likely to occur in those who responded poorly to treatment (25/37 patients (68%)) than in those who had an excellent response (7/27 patients (26%)). Cessation of treatment occurred in 29/82 patients (35%) mainly secondary to inefficacy or flare in 72.4% of these patients [131]. Tynjälä et al.'s 2009 study looked at length of anti-TNF therapy usage (either etanercept or infliximab). At 24 and 48 months 46% and 76% of patients, respectively, had discontinued their medications. Inefficacy was the most common reason for discontinuation in the sJIA group [182].
## (s17) Cyclosporine.
Number of References: 15

(p17.0) Cyclosporine is an immunomodulator that inhibits the synthesis of IL-1, IL-2, TNF-γ, and αinterferon [188][189][190]. The results of a 10-year prospective study looking at the efficacy of cyclosporine A showed benefit for some children with sJIA, but for the majority complete remission was not achieved [191]. In a later surveillance study, out of those patients who were still receiving cyclosporine at their last reported visit, only 5% have achieved full clinical response, while 63% had mild to moderate activity and 32% had severe uncontrolled disease [192]. Associated adverse reactions reported are hypertrichosis, elevated serum creatinine levels, gingival hyperplasia, gastrointestinal irritation, and hypertension [192].

(p17.1) 9.5. Thalidomide. Thalidomide prevents cytokine synthesis by disturbing mRNA synthesis rather than blockade [193], and is a known anti-inflammatory agent that suppresses angiogenesis, cell adhesion molecule expression, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and nuclear factor-κG [194][195][196]. In 2002, Lehman et al. reported on 2 children with intractable sJIA who were treated with thalidomide therapy and had significant improvement [197]. In 2004, Lehman et al. reported of 13 additional children who were treated with thalidomide. A response was seen in 11 children, and 10 of them had JRA improvement scores ≥50% in concordance with the preliminary definition of improvement in juvenile arthritis [120,170]. Statistically significant decrease in prednisone dosage, decrease in ESR, and increase in hemoglobin level were seen [120]. In 2007 a 3-patient case series was reported by Garca-Carrasco et al., where after therapy with thalidomide, 3 recalcitrant patients entered remission [198].
