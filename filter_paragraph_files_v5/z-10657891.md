(p13.0) The automorphism group of any circulant graph will have a cyclic subgroup that acts regularly on the vertices of the graph. (A permutation group on a set V is said to act regularly if for any pair of points in V , there is exactly one permutation in the group that maps one to the other.) Sometimes, the automorphism group of a graph may have multiple, nonisomorphic, regular subgroups. This is of interest from a different perspective, because it means that the graph in question can be represented as a Cayley graph on some noncyclic group, besides being a circulant graph. From our perspective, knowing the regular subgroups of the automorphism group may be useful in determining the automorphism group. There are only a few results of note on this topic. The first result was proven by Joseph in the special case n = p 2 [23], and extended by Morris [33] to all prime powers.
