## (s1) Coaching and guidance: definitions
Number of References: 2

(p1.0) Coaching is defined as the provision of support by a trained individual (either in person or remotely-for example by telephone or Internet), who is supportive but non-directive, for a patient or family facing a decision [3]. Using an iterative verbal exchange, elements of coaching include: a) assessing the patients' decision-making needs; b) providing information on their options, benefits, and harms (e.g., verbally or with patient education resources such as PtDAs); c) verifying their understanding; d) clarifying their values associated with the attributes of the options, and their attitude toward risks; e) building their skills in deliberating, communicating, and accessing support; f) screening for barriers to implementation; and g) facilitating progress in decision making [4]. Although the patient may express their leaning toward a specific option to the decision coach, agreeing upon an option occurs during consultation with the practitioner rather than with the coach. Trained health professionals, students, or laypeople can provide coaching before and/or after using a PtDA, as part of its delivery, or in the absence of PtDAs. Coaching may also be referred to as decision support, counselling, navigation, and/or facilitation of the decision-making processes.
## (s9) Empirical evidence from studies of PtDAs

(p9.0) The following evidence summary for coaching/guidance is based on findings from the Cochrane Collaboration Review of PtDAs, which included randomized controlled trials published to the end of 2009 (N = 86) [43], as well as from an updated search of PtDA trials published to the end of 2010 (N = 12). For decision coaching, we also used a sub-analysis of trials that evaluated decision coaching within trials of PtDAs [4]. This sub-analysis a) included trials that allowed the impact of decision coaching provided by a healthcare professional to be compared to another intervention and/or usual care, and b) excluded trials in which patients were exposed to coaching in both arms of the trial [45][46][47][48]. One other trial was excluded because only 12 of 136 women (8.8%) in the intervention group were exposed to decision coaching [49]. In this single study in which decision coaching was optional, few women initiated contact with the coach or accepted coach-initiated contact. These authors surmised that women in this study may have opted out of coaching because they did not perceive, prospectively, any added value compared to just using the decision guide [49].
## (s11) Evidence about guidance

(p11.0) Among 98 randomized controlled trials, 63 (64.3%) used PtDAs that contained some sort of explicit guidance in deliberation and/or communication. Examples of PtDAs  that did not provide explicit guidance used simple paper-based consent formats [50,51] or computer-based programs with conjoint analysis [52]. The amount of guidance varied considerably. Table 4 summarizes the types of guidance provided (these are not mutually exclusive). Only one trial of PtDAs compared guidance provided by different individuals [43]. In this trial, findings revealed that, compared to the same PtDA administered by a research assistant prior to the consultation, a PtDA administered by the physician during the consultation showed a non-statistically significant trend of higher acceptability of the PtDA and lower decisional conflict [53]. Given that more detailed PtDAs are more likely to include one or more of these elements of guidance in deliberation or communication, we also report evidence comparing simple to detailed PtDAs. Compared to simpler PtDAs, more detailed PtDAs produced higher gains in knowledge, more realistic expectations, and a greater match between patients' values and their chosen option [43]. However, the link between detailed PtDAs, explicit guidance, and effectiveness needs to be tested empirically.
