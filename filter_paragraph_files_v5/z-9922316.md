(p1.0) Bankart lesion is the major factor responsible for recurrent dislocation and shoulder instability [3,20]. Therefore, the aim of treatment should be achieving approximation of the detached labrum to the glenoid rim and immobilizing it in such position for the time needed for ligamentous structures to heal [19]. Itoi et al. have suggested, on the basis of a cadaveric study conducted on 10 shoulders, that the best approximation of the Bankart lesion is achieved in the position of adduction and ER, or abduction and neutral rotation [19]. A possible weakness of this study may be the removal of all muscles surrounding the joint, except for rotator cuff muscles, which alters the normal biomechanical relations of the joint. The subscapularis tendon creates anterior tension, significantly contributing to apposition of the tissues [21]. The contact force between the labrum and the glenoid was measured by Miller et al. for 10 cadaveric shoulders and compared for 3 positions: 60° of IR (force not detectable), neutral rotation (force measurable), and 45° of ER (maximum force) [22]. In contrast, Limpisvasti et al. found no difference in contact pressure between subscapularis and anterior labrum in the position of IR and ER in 8 tested shoulders [23]. Cadaveric studies have number of limitations, including the fact that artificial creation of the Bankart lesion may inadequately simulate the conditions after dislocation due to lack of associated capsular injury and absence of dynamic influence on the capsulolabral complex [24].

(p6.0) Due to its high incidence, reaching 26.69 per 100 000 population per year in a recently published study [13], and frequently involving complications, optimization of treatment of traumatic GHD with a view to preventing recurrence and improving patient performance has received much research interest. Since the idea of immobilization in external rotation first came to light, many studies have been dedicated to confirming its effectiveness and comparing it with the traditional immobilization in adduction and internal rotation [19]. Unfortunately, the conclusions of these works are often contradictory and do not allow to make clear recommendations for practice. This prompted us to conduct a thorough literature review in an attempt to organize the available reports and explain the disparity between favorable results of cadaveric as well as imaging studies and clinical reports, in which ER did not prove significantly more effective than IR.

(p6.1) After performing a comprehensive review of the available literature, we found that populations studied by particular authors differed in terms of age, sex, and physical activity levels, and different outcome measures were used. While the primary end point was consistently redislocation, secondary end points were not always present and if so, different QOL scores or return to pre-injury activity level were chosen in different studies. Not all studies were properly randomized and some had less than the recommended 2 years of follow-up. Moreover, higher compliance rates in the ER group, despite the ER orthosis being less comfortable in some studies, may indicate the presence of bias [40,44]. There was also a substantial difference between the angle of ER, in which coaptation has been proven to be most effective and the greatest angle accepted by patients (45° or 60°, according to different studies versus 10-15°) [22,37,[45][46][47]. Several studies confirmed that increasing the degree of external rotation is associated with worse patient discomfort, even when the brace was worn only for periods as short as minutes to hours [45][46][47]. Furthermore, the actual amount of ER achieved and maintained by orthoses was less than anticipated, especially when they are applied by lay persons [45]. The acceptability of the treatment by the patients needs to be studied further, with the compliance rates assessed after 2 to 3 weeks of continuous use.

(p6.2) Immobilization in ER and varying degrees of abduction is a new concept that has been studied recently [37,46,47]. Here as well, the disproportion between optimal degree of abduction required to achieve coaptation and the degree accepted by patients was found. Long-term results of immobilization in the position of ER and abduction are not yet available.

(p6.3) We find the use of external rotation braces especially questionable in elderly patients. Older patients are less likely to suffer recurrence after first-time traumatic GHD. The redislocation rates in those patients vary between 0% and 31% [52][53][54]. It has been detected in a cadaveric model that in patients below 30 years of age, the attachment of the labrum is the site most susceptible to damage, while in the subjects over 30 years the anterior capsule and subscapularis tendon are weaker in comparison to the capsular attachment [55]. The disparity in complication rates between young and elderly patients can be partly explained by different tissue properties. Structure of collagen fibers (the main component of the capsule, ligaments, and tendons) changes with advancing age. In young subjects, elastic collagen type III predominates, while in older patients it is replaced by tougher collagen type I. Therefore, stretching of the capsule and ligaments promoting redislocation is more likely in the young, while in older people capsular disruption or rotator cuff tear is more common [3]. Taking into consideration that subscapularis tear is a confirmed factor decreasing the effectiveness of immobilization in ER [39] and the generally lower redislocation rates in elderly patients, immobilization in external rotation is less likely to be effective in these patients. Moreover, elderly patients are initially less physically capable and wearing a large, cumbersome brace may further limit their ability to perform ADLs (activities of daily living) and be associated with increased risk of a fall. The higher price of an external rotation brace may also affect some patients.
