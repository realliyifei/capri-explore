(p6.0) Several studies focused on developing an innovative IRI prediction model based on fuzzy-based timeseries and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques [31,32]. In their study, Li et al. [33] revealed the importance of using PSO techniques to enhance the results of the performance models and future IRI prediction models. Furthermore, in their study, Li et al. [33] used an LTTP database to extract the IRI values for some urban roads in Canada. e methodology of this study focused on dividing the IRI values into granular spaces. For more illustration, they divided the IRI data into factors and subfactors. e factors section used the average IRI values from the longterm pavement performance database, while the subfactors data were measured in the left and right wheel path [34]. Moreover, a second-order fuzzy trend model was used to predict the performance of the IRI factors and subfactors data. Consequently, the fuzzy trend model was defined as follows:

(p6.1) where U ï¿½ {U1, U2, . . ., Un} is defined as a universe of discourse, A is a fuzzy set, fA is a membership function of the fuzzy set A, and fA (Un) is a membership degree of Un. By comparing the innovative IRI prediction method with other modeling approaches, such as polynomial fitting, autoregression integrated moving average (ARIMA), and backpropagation neural network (BPNN). e results showed that the IRI prediction model achieved high accurate forecasting compared with other modeling approaches. e IRI prediction error of the proposed model was identified using root mean square error (RMSE) and relative error (RE) to evaluate the ability of each model to provide accurate performance prediction. e results revealed that the IRI prediction model was accurate enough with the smallest error values compared with other modeling approaches. [35] focused on using probabilistic models to describe the change in pavement status and performance with time. ey mainly used significant variables, such as average annual daily traffic, pavement layers thickness, layers air voids, layers liquid limits, layers asphalt content, and annual rainfall, to build an accurate prediction model. Abed et al. [9] developed a probabilistic prediction model of flexible pavement, where the thickness and stiffness of the pavement layers were used as variables. Besides, the mean values, standard deviations, and probability distribution functions of these two parameters were considered to be variables. For this study, a road section in Nottingham, U.K., was selected as the case study.
