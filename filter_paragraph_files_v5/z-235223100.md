(p0.0) Proteins of resistance, in turn, identify distinctive elements of avirulence (Avr) which are not conserved between many pathogens. Induced-signaling resistance protein contributes to the manufacturing of reactive oxygen species and the induction of a particular form of programmed cell death, called the hypersensitive response, which damages the impacted cells (1). Also called gene-to-gene resistance is the resistance of protein-mediated innate immunity, as each R gene reacts to a particular pathogenic Avr gene (1). As a result, a big variety of R genes per plant genome are anticipated to be prepared to confer resistance to a wide range of pathogens. R genes are also under selection diversification to maintain pace with the fast pathogen evolution. Although distinct R genes react to very unique pathogens, they share multiple regions (domains) that have been conserved. R proteins can be split into four subclasses on the basis of these domains.
