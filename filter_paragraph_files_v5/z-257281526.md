(p6.0) Studies were first entered into a table mapping the primary studies contained within included systematic reviews, to analyse the degree of overlap between reviews. 'Calculated covered area' (CCA) was calculated to estimate degree of overlap in terms of a percentage, using the equation by Pieper et al. [39]. To aid in the discussion of the quality appraisal of included reviews by categorising reviews based on quality, the scoring system by Kilich et al. [40] was applied. Any item marked 'yes' scored two, items marked 'no' subtracted two, items marked 'unclear' subtracted one, and 'not applicable' did not affect the scores. Scores were categorised into very low, low, moderate, and strong. Overlap, quality of each review, and quality assessment of primary studies for the included reviews were mapped together onto one table.
