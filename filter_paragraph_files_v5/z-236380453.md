(p2.0) Research related to electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely done by many researchers. From the researcher's research, ECG research has been conducted by Pan and Tompkins [6]. Furthermore, many researchers who conducted ECG research also such as [7] whose research related to heart abnormalities arrhythmia using fuzzy logic method. Various method approaches are used to obtain a good end result, such as fuzzy, wavelet, machine learning or statistical methods [8]. There are even those who use tools (CSA) on Linux [9]. In this study, researchers tried to conduct research in terms of literature studies related to electrocardiograms (ECG).
