(p2.0) Just after the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy, Jindřich Matiegka, working at the University of Prague a few years after World War I, communicated his body composition vision in a May 7, 1920 letter to the prominent US physical anthropologist Aleš Hrdlička: "I shall send my proposal for establishing a commission that would work out a method for assessing work efficiency of the human body. I justify my proposal by pointing out that it is a duty of anthropology to develop a method for testing human physical capacity, similar to the methods worked out by psychologists to test mental capacity. Mental and physical capacities together constitute the working capacity and determine the working efficiency of the person" [14]. A year later, Matiegka published what is likely the seminal paper describing anthropometric measurement of skeletal muscle mass and three other functional body compartments [15]. Matiegka's system considered body weight (W) the sum of four components,

(p6.0) A remarkable range of technologies is now available for quantifying regional and total body skeletal muscle mass in almost any setting and at any age, even in utero. An important observation undergoing intense discussion in the sarcopenia field is the observation that skeletal muscle mass and function decline at different rates during the aging process [76,77]. What are the mechanisms of these effects? Should "functional" measures replace or complement "structural" measures as diagnostic components of conditions associated with skeletal muscle changes over time? Important focuses in this debate are the linkages between skeletal muscle structure, composition, and function. At the center of this chain, and one that holds future promise, is the assessment of skeletal muscle composition.

(p6.1) Separating adipose and muscle tissues Matiegka's anthropometric skeletal muscle compartment would by necessity include some adipose tissue interspersed between muscle fibers and compartments [15]. This marbling effect of intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) has been recognized in the animal science literature for decades, and ultrasound is the traditional measurement method of choice. The IMAT compartment, weighing several kilograms in adults [78] and a feature of sarcopenia, can now be accurately quantified my CT, MRI, or ultrasound. Anatomic skeletal muscle can be separated into two parts, IMAT and IMAT-free skeletal muscle.

(p6.2) Another MRI approach is to separate skeletal muscle tissue into two molecular level components, fat and fat-free muscle. A range of methods has been developed to accomplish this end that collectively is referred to as fat-suppression  [79]. These approaches all rely on the observation that hydrogen nuclei in the chemical environments of water and fat have different MRI relevant parameters, primarily relaxation time, and resonance frequency or so-called chemical shift. These differences can be exploited to suppress the fat-bound proton signal, and two main groups of techniques are available, relaxation-dependent (e.g., short inversion-time inversion recovery) and chemical shift-dependent (e.g., Dixon-based fat suppression) [80]. Scanning protocols now in development will soon provide estimates of regional and total body fat-free skeletal muscle volume. Possibilities exist to either fully or partially automate the analysis protocol, thus removing a major current task of expert hand image segmentation as is required for quantitative CT and MRI muscle analysis.

(p6.3) Separating muscle extracellular and intracellular compartments With aging and development of sarcopenia or with cachexia-induced skeletal muscle atrophy, there is a relative expansion of the extracellular space that includes fluid and connective tissue with loss of muscle fibers [81,82]. Several new magnetic resonance techniques hold promise for providing information related to the extracellular compartment [83].

(p6.4) The first of these methods is referred to as T1 mapping equilibrium contrast magnetic resonance that gives estimates of myocardial and potentially skeletal muscle extracellular volume fraction [84]. The protocol requires the use of an imaging contrast agent and so far has shown promise in detecting pathological changes in human myocardial tissue, representing a relative increase in extracellular volume and fibrosis [85]. Noncontrast T1-mapping also provides measures of cardiac fibrosis [86].
