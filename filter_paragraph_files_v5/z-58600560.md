(p5.0) Neurotoxicity refers to any reversible or irreversible adverse effect on the structure, function, or chemistry of the nervous system, during development or at maturity, produced by physical or chemical causes. Moreover, an adverse effect represents any change caused by treatment administration that affects the normal function. Common neurological adverse effects ( Figure 2) regarding morphological changes involve neuronopathy, axonopathy, myelinopathy, and gliopathy [61]. The main mechanisms for neurotoxicity involve the excessive production of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress, the release of cytokines causing neuroinflammation, and dysregulations of apoptosis leading to neuronal death [62]. However, there is a considerable lack of information regarding the neurotoxicity of nanomaterials, which complicates risk assessments following exposure. Therefore, the development of rapid, accurate, and effective strategies for determining the neurotoxic effects induced by nanomaterials is crucial [63]. categorized into invasive techniques, specifically in situ brain perfusion, intravenous injection, microdialysis, brain uptake index, cerebrospinal fluid sampling, blood/plasma ratio determination, and quantitative autoradiography, as well as non-invasive techniques, mostly involving imaging techniques [59].
