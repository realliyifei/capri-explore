(p6.0) One of the most challenging issues in treating morphea patients is the lack of globally accepted assessment tools for monitoring the results of treatment and disease activity. [33][34][35][36] In this regard, ultrasound is a potential and reliable imaging modality in the quantitative morphea assessment. However, ultrasound has limitations such as being operator dependent and lack of consistent intra or interoperator measurement of tissue thickness. It should be considered that there are discrepancies in available literature because of different cross-sectional study designs, using A-mode scan and various probe frequencies, and small sample sizes. To establish a quantitative, valid, and reproducible outcome measure, larger prospective cohort studies using higher probe frequencies should be conducted. In addition, shear-wave elastography can be used for disease monitoring and assessing therapeutic effects. SWE is a novel tool that is not universally available and it is not FDA approved for skin so far. To determine the role of SWE in detecting lesion progression and changes overtime, future studies are needed.
