(p0.0) Transitioning the primary energy supply to utilize non-emitting generation technologies requires a holistic assessment of impacts, mitigation and adaptation policies to ensure that actions in one area do not cause unintended consequences in another area [1,2]. For example, dedicating land to biofuel production could impact food availability, while planning for new hydroelectric facilities must consider plans for irrigation. Should these interactions be ignored, there is the risk that natural, human and financial resources are wasted. Systems modelling is one of the main tools used by policy makers to inform decisions on such multicriteria challenges. In general, there are two main model categories used for different types of decisionmaking [3]. The power engineering community has focussed on engineering solutions that replace the primary energy supply (largely fossil fuels) with a system fuelled predominantly by intermittent renewables and non-emitting power generation technologies. The energy-economy modeling communities have focussed on building models that capture the interaction of individual behaviour with climate policy (carbon pricing, flexible fuel standards, carbon trading) to be assessed within the framework of a national or jurisdictions economy. These disconnected responses create decision-making inertia which is problematic given the increasingly short timescale [4] in which meaningful climate mitigation strategies need to be invoked.
