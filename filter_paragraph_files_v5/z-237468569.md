(p2.0) In terms of bioaccumulation, the focus in the EFSA bat statement was to investigate whether there is greater concern for bats than for birds or ground-dwelling mammals and, therefore, whether the existing secondary poisoning risk assessment scheme within the EFSA (2009) is sufficiently protective. This concern predominantly arises due to the occurrence of hibernation and torpor (controlled reduction of body temperature and metabolic rate reducing energy expenditure) in bats. Bats accumulate stores of brown and white fats during active periods that are then metabolized and used as energy during hibernation and torpor as well as during arousal from these states. The EFSA bat statement postulates that high fat consumption during hibernation may expose bats to mobilized accumulated lipophilic active substances, potentially increasing the risk of direct mortality. For example, a study by Clark and Krynitsky (1983) investigating dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) observed high residues in brown fats, which were metabolized during hibernation and resulted in markedly increased DDE concentrations in the body. Although no toxic effects were identified in the study, Clark and Krynitsky (1983) questioned whether such effects may occur in the event of higher initial fat concentrations or for more toxic active substances. We do not consider it useful to refer to such legacy compounds for the assessment of current pesticide chemistry, with problematic compounds such as these now being screened out during the mandatory assessment of persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (PBT).
