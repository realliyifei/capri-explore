## (s1) SATELLITE CELLS IN MUSCLE PLASTICITY: FROM GROWTH TO REGENERATION
Number of References: 2

(p1.0) Skeletal muscle stem cell population was firstly identified by Mauro A. [8] and Katz B. [9] in 1961 by electron microscopy approach on frog and rat muscle samples, respectively. The denomination of Satellite Cells derived from the peculiar position within muscle tissue, in close association with single myofibers. As emerged from the first observation by Mauro and confirmed over time by more detailed studies, SCs occupied a protected location between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma, an exclusive niche preserving and regulating stem cell survival and behavior.
## (s4) Myogenic Differentiation of Activated Satellite Cells
Number of References: 7

(p4.0) The transition from satellite cells proliferation to differentiation involves the down-regulation of proliferativeassociated genes and the activation of specific differentiating markers, such as myogenin, neonatal isoform of myosin heavy chain (MHC), slow-twitch skeletal muscle troponin T (Tnnt1), cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle Ca 2+ -ATPase (Atp2a2), Insulin-like growth factor-2 (Igf-2), fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (Fgfr4), nicotinic cholinergic receptor alpha polypeptide 1 (Chrna1), and cardiac/slowtwitch skeletal muscle troponin C (Tncc) [63,64]. The permanent exit from the cell cycle is then ratified by the expression of p21 protein [65]. The expression of MyoD is not restricted to activated/proliferating SCs since it has been recognized as a master regulator of the myogenic program, modulating a suite of genetic and epigenetic mediators involved in myoblast differentiation ( Fig. 2B-C). For instance, it has been described that MyoD induced the expression of miRNAs promoting myoblast differentiation, as miR 206 and miR486 (Fig. 2C). When proliferating myoblasts engage the differentiative program, miR 206/486 are involved in the downmodulation of Pax7 by directly targeting the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of its gene sequence [66]. Although MyoD exerts the genetic control of myogenic factors, even its function is tightly regulated. The transcriptional activity of MyoD is known to be dependent on the association with chromatin modifiers as Baf60c, connoting the epigenetic control of its function. In this context the importance of the muscle-specific long non-coding RNA Linc-RAM it has been recently highlighted. Yu and colleagues reported that Linc-RAM can function as a transcriptional enhancer of MyoD, by promoting the formation of the MyoD-Baf60c-Brg1 complex, responsible for the expression of genes strictly required for myogenic differentiation [33]. Supporting this mechanistic model, Linc-RAM knock-out mice showed important defects in muscle regeneration due to an impaired muscle differentiation. Moreover, ChIP analysis in C2C12 myogenic cell line revealed that MyoD was significantly enriched in the promoter region of myogenin gene when Linc-RAM was over-expressed, indicating that this lncRNA can promote muscle differentiation [67]. In fact, the terminal differentiation of committed myoblasts requires the expression of both MyoD and myogenin, acting in a tightly regulated mechanism determining the expression of the myogenic regulatory factor 4 (Mrf 4), along with other markers of the terminally differentiated state [68].
## (s6) Other Myogenic Populations Contributing to Muscle Regeneration
Number of References: 37

(p6.0) Satellite cells are considered the primary players of regenerative myogenesis. However, it has been proposed that other non-muscle stem cells and progenitors, including endothelial-associated cells [98], interstitial cells [99][100][101], vessel-associated stem cells [102,103], and bone marrowderived stem cells [104,105] can contribute to muscle regeneration, supporting the activity of satellite cells.

(p6.1) In particular, a specific subpopulation of circulating hematopoietic/endothelial progenitors has been identified in human blood. These stem cells, expressing AC133 antigen, have been shown the capability to differentiate into myoblasts in vitro and to occupy the satellite cell niche in vivo [106]. In another work, a skeletal muscle side population (SP), has been recognized in muscle tissue and identified as CD45 neg. /c-Kit neg. /Sca-1 pos. /Abcg2 pos. cells [104,[107][108][109][110]. Skeletal muscle SP cells, exerting myogenic functions in muscle tissue, mostly originate from somites and can be divided into interstitial SP cells and satellite-SP cells, according to their specific anatomic location [110]. It has been observed that SP cells residing in muscular interstitium can contribute to muscle repair after injury, although they lack spontaneous myogenic activity in vitro [107]. In contrast, satellite-SP cells have been indicated as possible progenitors of satellite cells residing in close association with mature myofibers and maintaining their location even after single fiber isolation [110]. Other multipotent progenitors involved in adult myogenesis are vessel-associated stem cells with the mesodermal origin and elevated myogenic activity. In particular mesoangioblasts (MABs), originally isolated from the embryonic dorsal aorta, have been recognized in postnatal skeletal muscle and heart as multipotent progenitors associ-ated with small vessels [102,103]. These progenitor/stem cells are known to express endothelial-vascular and pericytes markers and have been shown to share a common signature with FAPs [103,111,112]. However, MABs exhibited a clear myogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo, differentiating into skeletal and smooth muscle [102,113,114]. In addition, aorta-derived stem cells have shown to exert a therapeutic potential in preclinical and clinical studies of muscle pathologies [113][114][115]. A class of progenitors correlated with MABs are pericytes, which are thought to derive from prenatal mesoangioblasts. It has been suggested that pericyte cells represent the interstitial progeny of prenatal MABs which can leave their endothelial location during development, acquiring a pericyte-like phenotype [111]. Pericytes exert myogenic activity in vitro [116,117] and are known to contribute to postnatal muscle growth and regenerative myogenesis, being also able to join the satellite cell compartment [116][117][118][119]. However, pericytes might also represent a heterogeneous population. Birbrair and colleagues identified two subtypes of pericytes in the skeletal muscle interstitium: type-1 pericytes, expressing NG2 marker and negative for Nestin; type-2 cells Nestin pos. /NG2 pos. [119]. In particular, while type-1 subtype is involved in fatty tissue accumulation and lacks myogenic activity in vitro and in vivo, type-2 cells have been identified as the myogenic subpopulation of pericytes in skeletal muscle [119].
## (s7) INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC ALTERATIONS OF STEM CELL BIOLOGY IN AGING AND DISEASES
Number of References: 14

(p7.0) Skeletal muscle tissue is known to retain elevated adaptive capabilities, being able to dynamically respond to metabolic changes and physical insults. However, it has been extensively described that the ability of muscle tissue to support homeostatic changes and regenerative processes is impaired during aging and diseases [120,121]. Aged muscles present a decline in the ability to respond to hypertrophic stimuli and to recovery after traumatic events. Since the SCs reservoir is mainly involved in muscle growth and repair, the intrinsic alteration of satellite cells accumulated throughout lifespan has been proposed as a key contributor to muscle weakening during aging. Genome-wide analysis on SCs derived from a range of healthy individuals, from 21 to 78 years of age, revealed that SCs accumulated a number of mutations every year [122]. These mutations occurring during aging seem to affect genes involved in SCs activity. In particular, it has been reported that SCs from human biopsies showed an impaired myogenic differentiation in vitro, which was directly correlated with the average number of carrying mutations, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to the loss of muscle mass maintenance in elderly [122].

(p7.1) Another proposed factor involved in the intrinsic alteration of SCs behaviour is telomere shortening that occurs at every cell division. Reduced levels in adult cells of telomerase, the enzyme responsible for telomeric DNA adjunction, implicated that subsequent SCs division throughout life could progressively reduce telomeres, until reaching the Hayflik minimum and thus proliferative senescence [123][124][125][126]. In spite of what reported in healthy individuals, a significant reduction of satellite cell telomeres has been described in patients affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) [126,127]. DMD is a genetic disease due to the ab-sence of a functional dystrophin protein and is characterized by extensive muscle degeneration, inflammation and impaired regeneration. The extent of necrosis in dystrophic muscle continuously stimulates regenerative processes which resulted in an inefficient tissue repair and led to the progressive exhaustion of the SCs pool [82,128]. In this context, several studies ascribed, at least to some extent, the impaired regenerative potential of SCs to premature senescence induced by their excessive proliferation. Indeed, SCs deriving from DMD patients showed a marked reduction of telomeres fragment length compared to healthy subjects. In addition, the progressive shortening of telomeres during the disease course was correlated with the delay of regenerative foci in older DMD patients, suggesting that satellite cell senescence could be involved in the abortive regeneration observed in dystrophic muscles at later stages of the pathology [126,127].
