(p3.0) In [37] and [52], the author's use of Alex-Net architecture is noted ,which is more recent than LeNet. In [37], the author used DCNN with the entire Alexnet architecture to create user-friendly, inexpensive, and reliable systems. The average accuracy was reached 88% using JAFEE and KDEF dataset. While in [52], the writer used Alex-Net, Shallow CNN, and enhanced VGG-19 DCNN for data processing to boost the machine learning algorithm's accuracy and performance, with the accuracy reached 96 %. After observing the results from these two previous research types, the accuracy was higher with DCNN [52]. The findings revealed that the DCNN was better than the shallow CNN at extracting image features that allowed more layers. Still, too many layers would result in overfitting of the training data, and output may decline.
