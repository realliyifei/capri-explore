(p3.0) The structure of a lead-acid battery is given in Figure 1. It consists of a positive and a negative electrode, which contain a lead dioxide (P b O 2 ) and a spongy lead (P b ) respectively, with both electrodes immersed in an aqueous sulphuric acid electrolyte (H 2 SO 4 ) [38]. The two most common types of lead-acid batteries in the market are the vented lead-acid (VLA) and the valve regulated lead-acid (VRLA) [1]. Compared to other battery technologies, lead-acid is the oldest and most mature, featuring low cost due to its widespread application [39,40]. In case of cost-sensitive applications, in which low energy density and limited life cycle are not an issue, while there is demand for roughness and tolerance against misuse, lead-acid batteries are dominating [1]. Additionally, they constitute a good solution for use as backup power source, since their characteristics of long-life and low-cost suit these application, where low duty cycle is required [41].

(p3.1) In addition to the low cost-to-performance ratio, lead-acid batteries present some other advantageous characteristics such as high voltage per cell, good capacity life, acceptable performance at room temperatures and good life cycle under measured conditions [42]. Furthermore, their charging technology is relatively simple, the maintenance requirements are low and they are characterised by large storage capacity [8,43]. Besides, they are spill-proof and easy to transport [44]. Other advantages include: fast response time, small daily self-discharge rate and moderate efficiency, which is higher in advanced designs such as the ones described in [10,45,46].
## (s6) Sodium Nickel Chloride

(p6.0) The sodium nickel chloride (NaNiCl 2 ), also known as "Zebra" battery, belongs to the broader family of high temperature batteries, operated at temperatures between 280 • C and 350 • C. The ionic conductibility of their ceramic electrolyte increases with temperature, which also justifies why the anode and cathode are in molten state during their operation [64]. Figure 4 shows the typical configuration of a NaNiCl 2 battery. The cathode consists mainly of nickel (Ni) and sodium chloride (NaCl) and the anode is made of sodium (Na). The electrodes are separated by a beta-alumina ceramic wall [38,45].  NaNiCl 2 batteries are characterised by high energy density, they present long life cycle and are practically maintenance-free [8]. Due to the characteristics of long life cycle, long discharge time and fast response, they are well suited to applications that engage bulk energy storage such as the ones within transmission systems, railway transportation and large renewable energy plants [44]. This claim is further expanded in [64], where the high suitability and compatibility of the electrical characteristic of this battery (e.g., its volumetric and gravimetric energy densities) with large-scale stationary storage is highlighted. Compared to the nickel cadmium (Ni-Cd) and nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH), they feature higher efficiency, in the range of 90% [42].
