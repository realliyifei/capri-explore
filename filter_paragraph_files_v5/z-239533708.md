## (s19) Application of Layered Hydroxides in Agriculture
Number of References: 5

(p19.0) Various applications of layered hydroxides in agriculture are summarized in Figure 3; smart fertilizers, nanosensors, pesticides remediations, precision farming, nanopesticides, etc. LHs and LDHs can be used in various agriculture sectors either as their original synthetic compounds or their derivatives; after modification, intercalation, etc., [5,6,8,12,40]. One of the important applications of LHs and LDHs is the formation of a new generation of pesticides. Various types of pesticides; herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, etc., as the AIs can be intercalated into the LHs and LDHs hosts. The number of combinations of host-guest complexes that can be formed via supramolecular chemistry is huge, thus opening up unlimited opportunities to produce and explore this area of research, development and innovation.

(p26.0) LH has a 2D inorganic layered structure, which is composed of a single metal hydroxide. Zn-LH is the most common one used to host various AI guests for the synthesis of nanopesticides that can be found in the literature, as shown in Table 4. For example, isoprocarb and carbamate were separately intercalated into the Zn-LH for the formation of their nanoinsecticides, resulting in better thermal stability and environmental friendliness of the AI compared with their counterparts [61,62]. Table 4. Nanopesticides synthesized using host-guest supramolecular chemistry using zinc-layered hydroxide as the host and various AIs as the guest for various targets and advantages.

(p31.0) Zn/Al-LDH is subjected to more intense research compared to other LDHs, regarding its use as the host of various AI pesticides for various nanopesticide applications. This is because it is relatively simple and cheap to prepare, and it is easier to form the 2D, well-ordered, inorganic, layered structure with good crystallinity. Table 5 shows the nanopesticides prepared using host-guest supramolecular chemistry based on Zn/Al-LDH. AIs such as mandelic acid were intercalated into Zn/Al-LDH to be used as slow-release preservatives and for crop protection [70]. Herbicides or defoliants; 2,4-dichlorophenoxy and 4-chlorophenoxy acetate were simultaneously intercalated into the Zn/Al-LDH and were found to be promising candidates which can simultaneously control the release of the two AIs at differently controlled rates [71]. Similarly, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acids in the presence of glyphosate showed better herbicide properties [72]. Table 5.
