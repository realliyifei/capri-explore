## (s6) Oxidized LDL from Diet: TLR-Mediated Effects
Number of References: 18

(p6.0) Cholesterol oxides are similar to cholesterol in structure; however, they are modified, due to oxidative reactions, to contain hydroxyl and epoxide groups, for example [148]. Cholesterol oxides can be consumed in the human diet and incorporated into chylomicrons, and assimilate into LDL particles in human serum [149]. These oxides are found in a variety of animal products, including beef, turkey, butter and eggs [148,150]. Cholesterol oxide concentrations in these foods increase in a time-dependent manner during storage, and are also increased following cooking. For example, oven-cooked beef, veal and pork resulted in an increase in cholesterol oxide content by 352%, 540%, 421%, respectively [151]. In addition to dietary cholesterol oxides, extracellular ROS derived from cells can oxidize endogenously produced cholesterol [152,153]. Cholesterol oxidation susceptibility ex vivo was found to be increased 37-39% following the consumption of egg yolks in humans, for example [154,155]. In a similar manner, patients with CVD also have a higher susceptibility for cholesterol to oxidize, compared to healthy controls [156]. Thus, under inflammatory conditions which coincide with increased oxidative stress, it could be expected that LDL particles would be oxidized in vivo, increasing the circulating pool of oxLDL and exacerbating the inflammatory response.

(p6.1) In addition, having higher serum cholesterol concentrations also results in increased oxLDL, due to the intrinsic fact that there is simply more LDL available to be oxidized. For example, oxLDL concentrations increase in a stepwise manner in human subjects with borderline-elevated serum LDL and high serum LDL compared to healthy controls [157]. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was diminished by 20% in these human subjects with elevated LDL concentrations, likely due to oxLDL concentrations, since native LDL does not appear to diminish endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, an enzyme involved in mediating vasodilation via release of nitric oxide (NO), while oxLDL did diminish eNOS activity [158]. Thus, consumption of animal products can (1) introduce dietary cholesterol oxides, (2) increase the propensity of cholesterol to oxidize, and (3) increase serum LDL, creating a greater opportunity for LDL oxidation.

(p6.2) In animal models, the consumption of cholesterol oxides as part of a high-cholesterol diet increased fatty streak lesions in the aorta of rabbits by 100% [159], 32% in LDLRdeficient mice, and 38% in ApoE −/− mice [160]. These detrimental effects may be due to TLR activation, as oxLDL particles mimic microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns which can be recognized by TLRs [161], particularly TLR4 [62]. In Wistar rats, the consumption of oxidized cholesterol for 14 weeks resulted in a~10% increase in left ventricle infarct size compared to control animals, while heart failure induction via isoproterenol was exacerbated by oxLDL (56% infarct size) compared with a standard diet without oxLDL (36% infarct size) [162]. These effects were tied to increased myocardial TLR4 mRNA, which mirrored changes in infarct sizes. Indeed, compared with other CVD risk factors, including serum lipoproteins alone, oxLDL concentration is a greater predictor of CVD events, even in otherwise healthy individuals [163].
