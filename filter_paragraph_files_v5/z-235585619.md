(p10.0) Systematizing the literature enables the identification of several trends in audit scheduling research. Models considering risk-based payoff functions apply them to practical cases (Hemaida 1997;Rai et al. 2013). Models minimizing makespan tend to be similar to job-shop scheduling models. Task precedence is not considered in these models. Moreover, recent models consider auditor eligibility for a task, given its skillset, and the possibility of assigning teams of auditors to tasks. Furthermore, some gaps are made evident. Models featuring teamwork never consider the duration constraints or the capacity of audit clients. Eligibility and payoff maximization have not been considered together in papers with examples of practical application. Travel has been neglected in recent papers, and there is no model intersecting travel with eligibility or teamwork. Time-windows were only considered for a mismatch and tardiness minimization problem with exclusivity and precedence constraints. Finally, there was a single paper making use of goal programming to conciliate the number of potential objectives of the plan.
