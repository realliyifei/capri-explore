(p14.0) Scoping studies are iterative; thus, proposed search terms may need to be refined as the extent of literature in the field becomes evident [33]. The literature search strategy will be initially developed for MEDLINE in consultation with an information specialist who has expertise in cancer reviews (RH). The MEDLINE strategy can be found in Additional file 3: Figure S1. An initial test of the search terms will be conducted in MEDLINE to refine the terms, and the search strategy will be modified for all other databases. A second information specialist at the University Health Network (Toronto, ON) has conducted a peer review of the search strategy using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist, which is common practice for scoping reviews [56,57]. Specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free text terms for self-management, self-efficacy, self-management support and related terms, i.e., "self-care" or "educat" or "activate," will be combined with terms for "cancer". These terms will be combined with implementation study terms, for example "real world," "routine clinical care," primary care, "Phase IV," "knowledge translation," "adoption," "integration," "dissemination" and "implementation" using Boolean logic operators (and, or).
