(p2.0) In this section, we provide an overview of technologies used for transmitting the vital physiological data from a cardiac patient to a remote monitoring station. The European EPI-MEDICS project [24] uses an intelligent personal ECG monitor (PEM) for the early detection of cardiac ischemia and arrhythmia. The PEM records a 3-lead ECG (DI, DII, and V2), derives the corresponding standard 12-lead ECG using a patient specific transform [25], and stores the information in patient's electronic health record (EHR) on a smart media card in the PEM device. The PEM generates different levels of alarms based on the ECG and the patient's clinical history, and forwards them with the recorded signals and the EHR to the health care providers by means of Bluetooth and GSM/GPRS in store and forward mode [26].

(p2.1) The fast development of mobile technologies, including increased communication bandwidth and miniaturization of mobile terminals, has accelerated developments in the field of mobile telecardiology [2]. Development of the efficient portable and body-worn devices and systems to measure physiological parameters of cardiac patients (e.g., ECG, heart rate, SpO2, and blood pressure) has been witnessing active research lately. A wireless PDA-based physiological monitoring system for patients inside the hospital was reported in [3] which transmits the acquired data to a central management unit by using the hospital WLAN.
