## (s13) Analysis of Negative Effect of Exercise Training Combined with Nutrition Supplement on CVA Patients' Rehabilitation
Number of References: 8

(p13.0) Walking is one of the most commonly used rehabilitation methods for CVA patients. However, even the simplest walking exercise may bring negative benefits to some CVA patients if the prescription intensity is not appropriate [77]. The lower limb muscles are in continuous stretching/shortening (eccentric centripetal, that is, SSC contraction) contraction during walking, so this rapid muscle contraction mode will lead to muscle damage, but long-term SSC training will significantly improve the performance and muscle hypertrophy of young adult rats [78]. However, when carrying out the same SSC training for aging rats, it will lead to decreased exercise performance and inflammatory reaction of cells. If the duration is longer, it may lead to inadaptable effects such as muscle function loss and muscle mass loss [79]. The latest research shows that [80], the older the subjects are, the more systemic inflammatory reaction and higher oxidative pressure will occur during a long period of moderate intensity muscle contraction speed and intermittent SSC training, which will lead to poor recovery ability of muscle injury and discomfort in muscle strength training. Sanchez Moreno et al. [73] discussed the relationship between the basic antioxidant capacity and the inflammatory response of CVA patients. The results showed that the plasma vitamin C concentration of CVA patients decreased significantly, accompanied by a significant increase in serum inflammatory indicators (C-reactive protein, etc.) and the concentration of oxidative pressure markers, indicating that there was a significant correlation between the decline of systemic antioxidant capacity of CVA patients and stroke related inflammatory response. Although a large number of studies have shown that exercise combined with nutrition supplement is beneficial to promote muscle growth or increase muscle strength, in the face of CVA patients, it may be affected by factors such as muscle degradation or muscle disuse, resulting in passivation reaction [29,80,81] (also known as "anabolic impedance phenomenon"), which makes muscles unable to maintain their muscle protein content by properly stimulating protein synthesis and leads to sarcopenia in the process of degeneration. It is also pointed out that, even though CVA patients receive rehabilitation treatment, there are still about 30-60% of patients whose motor function has not improved significantly, indicating that conventional rehabilitation training may have shortcomings. The reasons can be summarized as follows: (1) during the recovery of CVA prognosis, the regular rehabilitation exercise cannot obtain sufficient motor stimulation; (2) the increase in oxidative stress and inflammation caused by aging may affect the effect of muscle strength training; (3) aging factors cause the phenomenon of anabolic impedance.
