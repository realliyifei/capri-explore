Number of References: 7

(p9.0) Surveys typically inquire about dietary supplement use but not about the reasons for using such products. A report on NHANES 2007-2010 for the first time reports national survey data on consumers' reasons for using dietary supplements [3]. The Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) has conducted two series of surveys, one series on consumer use of supplements and one series on health professionals' use of supplements, and these surveys also include an analysis of the reasons given for supplement use [5,[11][12][13]. Table 3 shows comparative data from these three sources, relating to the reasons people give for using dietary supplements. From the CRN surveys, the table shows the 2011 data on consumer reasons for using supplements and the 2009 data on dietitians' reasons for using supplements [5,11]. Improving or maintaining overall health, supporting bone health, and filling nutrient gaps rank at or near the top in all these surveys.
