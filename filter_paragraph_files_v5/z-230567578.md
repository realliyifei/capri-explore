## (s2) Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) software metrics:
Number of References: 2

(p2.0) These metrics aim to assess the design of the OO system rather than implementation. This makes them extra appropriate to the OO model, the OO design places great focus on the stage of the software design, The suite of CK metric includes six metrics of the design complexity, these metrics can have utilized as predictors of maintainability, and the (LCOM) metric is disjoint with the maintainability. All (CK) metrics are briefly illustrated (exclude LCOM) as the following [9]: 1-WMC (Weighted Methods per Class): This metric represents sum of weight for the whole method which is declared in the class. This metric measures the class' complication, to maintain and evolve the class, this metric predicts how much effort and time is needed. High value of this metric (WMC) refers to bigger complication and hence lower maintainability [5].
## (s9) 4-Number of Local Methods (NOM):
Number of References: 2

(p9.0) It is a metric of an OO that counting the native methods' number of a class. 5-Size 1: It is a conventional Line of Code (LOC) metrics. This metric is utilized to count the semicolons' number which presents in a class. 6-Size2: number of methods plus number of attributes [10] Once the data values of the maintainability for the software are specified, a try is made to institute a relation among the metrics and the desired maintainability of the software. The maintainability 'change' is measured as the "number of lines which changed per class". In this method, while developing the relationship, 'change' is deemed as a (dependent variable) and every one of the metric groups as (independent variables) set. Maintainability is thus supposed to be a function of the utilized metrics and may be represented as a function of various CK metrics as following [11]:
## (s12) Multiple linear Regression (MLR)
Number of References: 3

(p12.0) In 1993, Wei Li and Sallie Henry [10] studied the metrics of the software in the procedural paradigm as a quantitative means to assess the development process of the software as well as the software product quality. The paper focuses on some OO metrics of the software and these metrics validation with the effort of the maintenance in two commercial systems. Statistical analyses of a prediction model were performed incorporating 10 metrics. In addition, a more compact model was presented with fewer metrics. In 2010, S. Rizvi and R. Khan [12] developed a multivariate linear model, which is utilized to estimate the class diagrams' maintainability depending on their understandability and modifiability. Two extra multivariate models were suggested in order to quantify the modifiability and understandability of the class diagram. These models utilize the OO metrics of the design level. This early maintainability' quantification provides a chance to improve the class diagram' maintainability and as a result the final maintainability of the software. All three models have been validated during suitable statistical measures. In 2012, Alisara and Wanchai [13] suggested a multivariate linear regression for establishing the prediction model of the maintainability depending on extendibility and flexibility which are sub-features of maintainability as a standard for assessing the model of the class diagram' maintainability and evolve the Maintainability Estimation Tool (MET) to estimate a class diagram' maintainability. This tool assists the designer of the software to improve the class diagram's maintainability in the stage of the design and helps to minimize the increasingly high cost of software maintenance stage.
## (s15) Fuzzy model
Number of References: 2

(p15.0) In 2012, Sanjay and Ajay [5] presented a model of fuzzy to quantify the OO software system's maintainability. This model accepts the projects of OO and estimates its maintainability. The result gained by the model of the fuzzy is validated by utilizing the technique of analytical hierarchy processing. The inputs for the suggested model on which maintainability depends are class, complexity, inheritance, coupling, and children's number. These inputs were specified depending on the study and utilizing extensive survey. The rule base was produced by the knowledge of the expert, with 243 rules for assessing an object-oriented software system. The suggested model assessed the maintainability of two object-oriented software systems. The outcomes are validated by the AHP technique. This model will assist the maintainability practitioners, software developers, and researchers to choose the better maintainable object-oriented software system when different alternatives are offered before them.
