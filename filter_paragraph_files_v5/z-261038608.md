(p2.0) A literature review is important when initiating and conducting research to prepare and expose researchers to various techniques to analyze ideas, find relationships between different ideas, and understand the nature and use of arguments in research. It also screens and summarizes the search for quality research using a scientific methodology (Cronin, 2013). The literature review provides explanations, discussions, and examples of how to analyze the ideas of others and ideas that make up the body of knowledge on the research topic. Systematic literature review (SLR) differs from traditional narrative reviews because it collects all publications and related documents that are appropriate to the criteria required, in order to answer specific research questions, whilst using clear and systematic procedures to find, identify, evaluate, synthesize, and analyze studies (Hart, 1998). The systematic literature review method also helps provide in-depth results and solutions while suggesting a reasonable and ideal solution in the field of interest (Masapanta-Carrión & Velázquez-Iturbide, 2018).
