(p4.0) Theorem. The Schauder fixed point theorem is a significant result in fixed point theory which bridges compact and non-compact sets. It was first proved by Juliusz Schauder in 1930 [101]. It states that if a continuous function T maps a nonempty, compact, convex subset K of a Banach space X into itself, then T has at least one fixed point in K. Afterwards a number of generalizations of this results have been made. One of the most famous ones was by Tychonoff [118], which is now known as the Schauder-Tychonoff fixedpoint theorem.
