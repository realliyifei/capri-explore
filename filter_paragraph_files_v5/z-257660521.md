## (s1) NO/NOS in Cellular Life
Number of References: 6

(p1.0) The identification of NO as a key endothelium-derived-relaxing-factor (EDRF) and the discovery of the synthesis of NO from L-arginine opened new ways of deciphering physiological pathways of utmost importance. Among these are the maintenance of vascular tone, the mediation of cellular defense, and at the level of the central and peripheral nervous system, the mediation of neurotransmission. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the mitochondrial level is of particular importance for respiration and cell life, thereby mediating cell survival and death [19]. Due to the energy-intensive activity of neuronal synapses, energy-producing mitochondria are essential for the integrity of synapses and appropriate neural synaptic function [6]. The synthesis of ATP via the mitochondrial respiratory chain comes at the cost of producing superoxide anions [20,21]. Intramitochondrial antioxidant systems scavenge this radical to avoid oxidative damage or generation of other reactive species such as RNS, which can lead to impaired ATP production [22,23].

Intramitochondrial antioxidant systems scavenge this radical to avoid oxidative damage or generation of other reactive species such as RNS, which can lead to impaired ATP production [22,23].

(p2.1) Brain homogenates have been shown to contain L-arginine, which can be utilized in the production of NO and L-citrulline. Through the activation of NMDAR by glutamate [7,24,25], the formation of NO from L-arginine is amplified, due to the elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ levels and subsequent activation of Ca 2+ dependent nNOS and eNOS [26]. NO acts as an inhibitor of the noradrenergic, noncholinergic pathway (NANC) in the peripheral nervous system, named nitrergic neurotransmission [27]. The nitrergic pathway acts together with the noradrenergic and cholinergic pathways, contributing to the propagation of the action potential in the peripheral nervous system. The noradrenergic and cholinergic pathways are controlled and counteracted by NO [27].
## (s10) Dopamine Metabolism and NO/NOS System in PD
Number of References: 13

(p10.0) Given that dopaminergic neurons are the main cells affected in PD, it is important to discuss certain physiological characteristics and their connections with NO/NOS system. These neurons, being part of the substantia nigra, are highly important in extrapyramidal pathways, controlling and modulating movement [76]. Loss of their function will lead to persistent alterations in the nigrostriatal pathway, ultimately generating the characteristic symptoms observed in PD [18]. Although it is unclear why these neurons are specifically targeted in PD, some hypotheses have been proposed. Inflammation and excessive ROS/RNS formation, as well as decreased levels of antioxidants, have been linked to cell death [48,77]. Dopaminergic neurons are particularly sensible to oxidative stress, making them more vulnerable to inflammation and high concentrations of ROS [6]. Excessive ROS can also be produced via mitochondrial dysfunction, which has been proposed in PD pathophysiology. Recent studies have linked mutations in DJ-1, Parkin, and PINK1, genes involved in mitochondrial function, to early onset PD [45]. Dopaminergic neurons contain both synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR, making them highly susceptible to glutamate excitotoxicity [33]. High levels of glutamate will bind to an increased number of NMDARs, inducing a rise in Na + and Ca 2+ intracellular levels. While Na + leads to neuron swelling, which is reversible, Ca 2+ mediates irreversible cellular injuries, initiating the process of apoptosis [33]. Ca 2+ -induced apoptosis is triggered by imbalances in this ions' homeostasis, mainly through increased intracellular quantities. By binding to calmodulin, its main cofactor, Ca 2+ activates certain protein kinases and phosphatases, which regulate gene transcription, thus upregulating apoptosis [78].

(p10.1) It is worth mentioning that high intracellular Ca 2+ levels will lead to NO formation [10,79], and that NO can activate NMDAR by inhibiting dopamine reuptake [18], thus creating a positive feedback loop. NMDARs are also involved in secondary excitotoxicity, even in the absence of glutamate. A decreased ATP level (due to NO-induced mitochondrial impairment) can inhibit the Na + /K + pump, leading to partial cell depolarization and triggering the consistent activation of the NMDARs [67].
## (s12) S-Nitrosylation in Alzheimer's Disease
Number of References: 13

(p12.0) In sAD, a variety of proteins essential for synaptic survival and function are abnormally S-nitrosylated, causing synapse loss and neurodegeneration [6]. The Apoε gene encodes a group of lipoproteins essential for maintaining CNS cholesterol homeostasis [6,91,92]. There is evidence that Apoε4 is a significant genetic risk factor for sAD developing [6,93]. Moreover, in the human hippocampus, both Apoε2 and Apoε3 can be S-nitrosylated [6,91], as shown in an experimental cell culture study [94], which may result in altered protein conformation, decreasing its affinity for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors [6]. Samples from both cell culture and human hippocampus revealed that Apoε2 and ε3 can be S-nitrosylated, suggesting a potential role of this post-translational modification in sAD [6]. Moreover, there is an isoform-specific difference for Apoε in microglial NO production: mice expressing the Apoε4 protein isoform have a greater NO production than mice expressing the Apoε3 protein isoform, and both neurons and macrophages from Apoε4 transgenic mice exhibit a similar increase in the uptake of arginine [91]. In AD patients with the ε4 allele, increased cerebral oxidative stress has been seen [91].
## (s15) NO in Memory and Learning
Number of References: 16

(p15.0) In a healthy brain, NOS enzymes play an important role in memory and learning development [84,100].

(p15.1) LTP is a fundamental process for memory formation in the hippocampus, the center responsible for memory and learning [4,7,101]. Being a form of synaptic plasticity, it has been shown that LTP is influenced by NMDAR through repetitive stimulation [102]. This repetitive stimulation, which in other cases has been shown to be detrimental due to excitotoxicity, is beneficial in the case of LTP, strengthening its connections [103].

(p15.2) Previous studies have linked the well-functioning of LTP to the NO/cGMP pathway [4]. It has been shown through multiple experiments [104,105] that NOS inhibitors lead to impaired learning and memory through LTP impairment, thus implying a positive role of NO in these processes [101].

(p15.3) However, due to the decreased number of NMDAR, as a result of both aging [96,97] and AD pathophysiology [106], it was postulated that NO synthesis is upregulated, in an attempt to maintain the LTP functioning, but ultimately leading to neurotoxicity [107,108].
## (s16) nNOS, eNOS and Cerebral Blood Flow in Alzheimer's Disease
Number of References: 23

(p16.0) Due to the extensively high energy demands coupled with the paradoxically low energy storage, the brain requires continuous and dynamically regulated blood supply in order to maintain proper function [109]. A precise and prompt blood flow control that can dynamically increase the supply to areas of intense neuronal activity is thus required. This process, named neurovascular coupling (NVC), is accomplished by the communication between active neurons and the cells that form the neurovascular compartment [110] through a multitude of molecular pathways. Among those pathways, NO plays a ubiquitous key role in the process and is essential for the development of the neurovascular response.

(p16.1) Through the formation of a supramolecular complex with NMDAR, nNOS activity becomes regulated by glutamate, through Ca 2+ intracellular influx [25]. As a result of NMDAR activation. Properly dimerized nNOS will proceed to produce NO, however, under the condition of disrupted dimerization, the enzyme catalyzes the uncoupled oxida-tion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), with the production of superoxide instead [111]. One of the noteworthy factors that can lead to reduced nNOS dimerization is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) availability, which has been noted to be reduced in AD patients [112].

(p16.2) Physiologically, NO produced in neurons with intense activity can diffuse intercellularly, reaching the smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of adjacent cerebral blood vessels. There, through the activation of sGC and the formation of cGMP, NO exerts a vasodilatory effect through the relaxation of smooth muscles cells [113]. While the increased cGMP degradation described in the previous chapter can decrease NO's effectiveness, a more substantial decrease can be attributed to NO scavenging produced by superoxide, and subsequent formation of peroxynitrile [25]. Thus, nNOS dysfunction, in the form of disrupted dimerization, can decrease the vasodilatory effectiveness of NO by increasing superoxide's NO scavenging, while also increasing NO's toxic effects through the increased production of peroxynitrile.

(p16.3) Furthermore, Aβ can reduce the responsiveness to vasodilatory molecules such as NO, resulting in decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) [114], which in turn will promote the formation of more Aβ, creating a vicious cycle that will sustains the progression of the disease. However, Aβ accumulation and involvement in the progression of the disease occurs in the later stages of the disease, with NVC changes preceding both NO dysregulations and Aβ accumulation [25,115].

(p16.4) In summary, nNOS dysfunction prompts a vicious cycle in which NO's vasodilatory effectiveness is impaired, while its toxic effects, through the increase in peroxynitrile, are amplified. Furthermore, peroxynitrile can further sustain the progression of the cycle by oxidizing BH4, inhibiting sCG expression and activity, and promoting structural alteration in cerebral blood vessels [25,116]. eNOS is the constitutive NOS form found in endothelial cells, requiring similar cofactors and conditions as nNOS to function properly. Unlike nNOS, eNOS is activated as a result of Ca 2+ influx caused by shear forces experienced by the endothelial cells [91,117]. After activation of eNOS, the NO produced is able to diffuse to the underlying smooth muscle cells and trigger relaxation and vasodilation [91,117].

(p16.5) While experimental data show that eNOS expression is upregulated in AD models [118,119], its activity can be decreased by uncoupling caused by peroxynitrile or a BH4 deficit [91,117]. The effectiveness of NO can be reduced by the production of superoxide by the uncoupled enzyme [25,117]. Additionally, Aβ accumulation can reduce the responsiveness of vessels to NO produced by eNOS, similar to the case of nNOS. Of importance might be the fact that increased eNOS expression is seen in the same locations where elevate nitrosative stress is quantified by increased nitrotyrosine levels [91], which could be caused by an increase in expression as a response to reduced activity due to uncoupling. However, additional research is needed.
## (s19) NO and Oxidative Stress-Associated Lipid Peroxidation in Alzheimer's Disease
Number of References: 19

(p19.0) NO interacts with a variety of molecules, including lipids [4]. Unsaturated fatty acids found in membranes, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are susceptible to harmful oxidative damage from this highly reactive nitrogen species [22,91,92,122].

(p19.1) Chemically reactive aldehydes such as malondialdehyde (MDA), acrolein, 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) are released as a result of fatty acid peroxidation [20,22,34,122]. HNE is primarily found in membranes and interacts with membrane proteins to form adducts in neuronal cells [22,34,122]. Thus, HNE can possibly obstruct the transmission of signals along the neurons, cause neuronal damage, and result in cell death [22,34,122]. Additionally, HNE reacts with Aβ and adds covalent modifications, causing the formation of cross-linkages and ultimately aggregation, a defining feature of AD [22,34]. Acrolein has also several harmful effects, including membrane disruption, disruption of mitochondrial biogenetics, protein adduction, and DNA oxidative stress [22,34].
## (s20) NO and Mitochondria in Alzheimer's Disease
Number of References: 15

(p20.0) In AD, damaged mitochondria due to Aβ are unable to maintain the energy demands of the cell, and the activity of ATP synthase is decreasing [23,122]. Thus, AD may contribute to mitochondrial malfunction, including excessive fragmentation, which in turn causes synaptic dysfunction, neuronal damage, and finally cell death [4,22,123]. There is growing evidence that NO disrupts mitochondrial energy dynamics by competing for oxygen with cytochrome oxidase [23]. Neuronal cellular death results from poor energy production, disrupted mitochondrial function, and a disparity in the body's capacity to combat ROS [23,123]. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) is a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fission. S-Nitrosylation of DRP1 is increased in AD patients, thus increasing its activity through a gain of function modification [4,21]. As a result, excessive mitochondrial fission, energy depletion, and ultimately dendritic spine loss result from this SNO-DRP1 synthesis [4,6]. Moreover, peroxynitrile is suggested to cause protein aggregation through nitrosylation of membrane protein thiols in mitochondria [6,22]. This leads to the formation of pores, which would compromise the structural and organizational integrity of the mitochondrial membrane, hence resulting in the efflux of mitochondrial contents such as apoptosis-inducing factors, consequently leading to apoptotic neuronal loss [22].
