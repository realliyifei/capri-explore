## (s6) Pyrolysis of Bi-metallic MOFs
Number of References: 10

(p6.0) Bi-metallic MOFs contain two different inorganic metal nodes that have similar coordination activities with the same organic ligands, which offer a possibility to tailor the chemical composition of final products if one of them can be removed through high-temperature pyrolysis. It is well known that metallic Zn nanoparticles have low boiling point (600-900 °C) [51], and thus, Zn-containing bimetallic MOFs are popular precursors in this strategy [52]. Wang et al. employed Zn-Co ZIFs as the precursor of Co/C composites, and they raised carbon content from 47.4 to 56.7 wt% by intensifying the removal of Zn-related species at high temperature [53]. When the pyrolysis temperature was 600 °C, RL intensity and EAB of the corresponding Co/C composite were − 50.7 dB and 4.2 GHz, respectively, with the absorber thickness of 2.5 mm. Similarly, Ji's group introduced Zn 2+ into Fe-MOF-5, while they found that the weight ratio of Fe nanoparticles to carbon frameworks was not changed obviously in the temperature range of 600-700 °C [54]. Although higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in a great impact on the chemical composition of final Fe/C composite, this variation weakened its EM absorption performance to a large extent because the impedance matching was much deteriorated. Subsequently, they manipulated Zn 2+ /Co 2+ atomic ratio in bi-metallic ZIFs from 0 to 3.0 and realized the adjustment of carbon content from 38.3 to 48.7 wt%, and then harvest the strong RL intensity of -32.4 dB and the broadest EAB of 5.27 GHz with an absorber thickness of 1.9 mm [55]. From the current results, one can conclude that the relative content of MOFsderived magnetic carbon-based microwave absorbers may be indeed controlled by the introduction of Zn 2+ , while the regulated range is not as obvious as expected. What's worse, the formation of intermediate phase (i.e., Co 3 ZnC) cannot be avoided and the removal of Zn-related species is always incomplete, and thus, this method decreases the content of magnetic nanoparticles monotonously, as well as their contribution to magnetic loss.
## (s8) Introduction of Additional Carbon Components

(p8.0) Compared with various magnetic components, the introduction of additional carbon components into MOFs-derived composites receives much more attention, because carbon materials have morphological diversity as well as better MOFs compatibility than magnetic metals or ferrites. Yang et al. deposited NiFe PBAs nanocubes on graphene oxide uniformly to be the precursor of NiFe@C/reduced GO (rGO) composite [78]. With the adjustment of pyrolysis temperature, the optimal NiFe@C/rGO composite displayed strong RL intensity close to − 40.0 dB and high absorption efficiency (over 90%) in X band. Inspired by this work, rGO becomes a popular candidate to regulate EM properties of MOFs-derived magnetic carbon-based composites [79][80][81][82]. The introduction of rGO not only reinforces the overall dielectric loss of carbon-based composites, but also provides powerful polarization relaxation through more heterogeneous interfaces. It is worth noting that the advantages of bi-metallic MOFs are highly considered when MOFs/GO precursors are fabricated. For example, Xu et al. assembled CoNi-1,3,5-trimesic acid microspheres and GO nanosheets to produce CoNi@NC/rGO comprising pomegranate-like CoNi@NC nanoclusters and ultrasmall CoNi-decorated graphene [83]. EM measurements manifested that CoNi@ NC/rGO could be a promising microwave absorber with strong RL intensity (− 68.0 dB) and broad EAB (6.72 GHz) with the absorber thickness of 3.0 and 2.5 mm, respectively, and its performance was greatly superior to those of individual CoNi@NC or CoNi/rGO. Zhao et al. also demonstrated the positive contribution of alloy nanoparticles and rGO nanosheets clearly, where CoNi@NCPs-rGO could lower minimum RL intensity of Co@NCPs from − 49.8 to − 58.2 dB [84]. Very interestingly, Wang et al. decorated bi-metallic FeCo-ZIFs on the surface of freeze-drying rGO aerogel and then converted the precursor into porous cocoon-like FeCo/NC/rGO composite [85]. They found that this composite possessed many desirable characteristics favorable for EM absorption, such as magnetic loss, dielectric loss, resistance loss, interfacial polarization, and good impedance matching, which were responsible for its very broad EAB of 9.29 GHz with the absorber thickness of 2.63 mm. In some cases, metal sites in MOFs were transformed into magnetic ferrites at relatively low temperature, while the presence of rGO nanosheets could also optimize their EM properties and bring considerable EM absorption performance [86].

(p11.0) It is well known that the attenuation of EM waves is not only determined by the intrinsic EM properties of microwave absorbers, but also highly associated with their interior microstructure that may promote energy consumption through multiple reflection or scattering behaviors of incident EM waves [121,122]. As a result, there is still great interest in developing various profitable microstructures in MOFs-derived magnetic carbon-based microwave absorbers except from those naturally derived micropores and mesopores, in despite of the fact that some significant breakthroughs from composition optimization have been witnessed. In this section, we focus on several effective strategies for the construction of some unique microstructures in MOFs-derived magnetic carbon-based microwave absorbers that can promote their EM absorption performance greatly.

(p18.0) Herein, the recent developments of various strategies on elaborate composition and microstructure design in MOFsderived magnetic carbon-based composites, together with their promising applications in EM absorption, are summarized in detail. It is undoubted that composition optimization is indeed favorable for the reinforcement of microwave absorption performance by improving impedance matching and EM characteristics of final composites, and microstructure upgradation brings many additional effects, including the formation of conductive networks and the substantial extension in propagation distance of incident EM waves, as well as more powerful dipole orientation polarization and interfacial polarization. Although some breakthroughs have been witnessed in the synthesis and application for EM absorption of MOFsderived magnetic carbon-based composites with tunable chemical compositions and various microstructures, this research field still remains many challenges. First, the combination of carbon components and magnetic nanoparticles can overcome the shortcomings of individual counterparts and produce a synergistic effect to upgrade EM absorption performance, while most composites with optimized ratio of magnetic and carbon components are only active in the  [154] frequency range of 8.0-18.0 GHz. This situation seriously hinders their practical application in the field of electronics industry since the effective working frequency of many electronic devices is usually lower than 8.0 GHz, and thus, the composition optimization for low-frequency absorption is urgently developed. Second, the state of the art in microstructure design is usually dependent on some assisted strategies (e.g., etching, templates, and SiO 2 /polymer coating) and involves complex multi-step processes, which set an obstacle for their practical application. A simple strategy is still desirable for microstructure upgradation in MOFsderived magnetic carbon-based composites. For example, sonochemistry has displayed its advantages in the creation of various unique microstructures in MOFs derivatives by breaking the dimensional limitation and controlling the thickness of shell, while it is still inaccessible in the field of EM absorption. Third, it is well known that the frameworks of MOFs crystals are designable and can be incorporated with different metal ions/clusters and organic linkers during the self-assembly process, and thus, it will be expected to obtain high-performance microwave absorbers from various MOFs. However, the current works mainly concentrate on ZIFs, PB or MIL series derivatives, which means other novel MOFs may reveal new outcomes to enrich the diversity of microwave absorbers. Fourth, there are hundreds of papers on EM absorption of magnetic carbon-based composites with different microstructures published in recent years, and most of them lack the in-depth understanding about the microstructure-property relationship. A comprehensive investigation on attenuation mechanism of different microstructure to EM waves will be greatly helpful for readers to understand how to design the microstructure of their samples. Fifth, performance is just one of the requirements in practical application, and besides, environmental tolerance is another important character for microwave absorbers to keep their durability. The encapsulation of magnetic nanoparticles on carbon matrix may be efficient to improve the environmental tolerance of magnetic carbon-based composites. What's more, in terms of current market prospect, high cost of MOFs is an inevitable barrier for the commercialization of their derivatives, and thus, the search of an effective strategy for low-cost mass production is also a challenging and in high demand task. When these problems are solved one by one with the tireless efforts of global researchers, novel magnetic carbon-based composites with reasonable compositions and elaborate microstructures from MOFs will exhibit a bright prospect as high-performance microwave absorbers for EM pollution precaution.
