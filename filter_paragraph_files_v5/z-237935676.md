## (s4) Models of NDDs

(p4.0) The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the most studied organisms in the eukaryotic kingdom. Presenting unique attributes, such as easy handling, short generation time and high amenability for genetic manipulation, S. cerevisiae has been established as a versatile and powerful experimental model in diverse areas of biology [62,63]. Remarkably, yeast shares highly conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms with human cells (e.g., cell division, DNA replication, metabolism, protein folding and intracellular trafficking), thus representing an invaluable model to study the major biological processes involved in several human diseases [64]. More than 400 essential yeast genes can be replaced with their human orthologs. Moreover, nearly a thousand yeast genes belong to orthologous gene families associated with human diseases [65]. In what concerns NDDs, yeast models have been described to recapitulate important pathological features, with a special focus on mitochondrial dysfunction, trafficking defects, proteasomal impairment and transcriptional dysregulation [64,66]. Besides being useful for the study of NDDs intricacies, such models have also been explored as in vivo platforms to identify the bioactive properties of compounds with therapeutic potential [63]. The data presented in this section summarizes the knowledge generated using yeast as a simple eukaryotic model to screen the biological effects and respective cellular targets of LMWPM in the protection against the pathological mechanisms of NDDs.
## (s6) C. elegans

(p6.0) Several studies used the nematode C. elegans to test the effect of bioactive compounds in neurodegeneration phenotypes or lifespan extension and in particular for the effects of LMWPM (Table 3). When administered to control strains of C. elegans 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde per se did not induce any locomotion phenotypes. However, if administered to worms exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a validated model of PD-like features that display slow and progressive degeneration of the dopamine system, this LMWPM can rescue some of the PD phenotypes [99]. After 6-OHDA administration, worms display a decrease in body bends compared to controls, a phenotype associated with 6-OHDA-induced PD. Furthermore, in the same study, in the transgenic strain BZ555, in which dopaminergic neurons are tagged with GFP, co-exposed to 6-OHDA and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde, it was observed that the treatment conferred neurological protection, measured as the decrease of dopaminergic cell death and rescue of the locomotion phenotype [99].
## (s7) Drosophila

(p7.0) Drosophila is progressively emerging as a model organism to study the role of (poly)phenol metabolites in life extension and protection in aging and NDDs models ( Table 4). Flies that were fed with 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid together with a sucrose solution, were shown to have protective properties through the increase of antioxidant enzymes activity, namely SOD, catalase and glutathione S-transferase. Furthermore, 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid has also been shown to be protective against urethane-induced genotoxicity and oxidative stress, an environmental mutagenic [105]. Additionally, 0.1 mM 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, 0.1 mM 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 0.5 and 1 mM of 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, all LMWPM, were given individually in a 0.1% sucrose solution to flies exposed to paraquat (PQ), a chemical used to induce Parkinson's disease, and were able to extend the lifespan of the flies, and to ameliorate PQ-nduced locomotor defects [106,107]. In a different study, in which parkin (a PD-disease gene with ubiquitin-ligase activity, required for mitophagy) was knocked down in dopaminergic neurons and chronically exposed to PQ, a model in which mitophagy is impaired and ROS are produced at much higher levels, 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid at 0.1 and 0.5 mM could not rescue neither the locomotor defects nor the reduced lifespan of these flies. This result suggests that this compound does not interfere with the molecular mechanisms affected in this model, namely mitophagy and parkin [108]. Still, in a genetic model of Alzheimer's disease 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid showed anti-BACE1 and anti-cholinesterase activity [109].
