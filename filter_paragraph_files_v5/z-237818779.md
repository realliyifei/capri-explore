## (s28) Adaptive Fractal Analysis (AFA)
Number of References: 3

(p28.0) In the past three decades, many efforts have been made to estimate H, the most important parameter for random fractals. As a result, many excellent methods for estimating H have been proposed. Among them is the celebrated detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [151,152]. It works as follows: To analyze a time series, x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , · · · , one first determines its mean x, then constructs a random walk process using Equation (76). By doing so, one has assumed that the data are like a noise process. One then partitions the random walk into non-overlapping segments of length l (therefore, the number of distinct segments is not larger than N/l, where N is the length of the time series). One furthers determines the local trend in each segment by using the best linear or polynomial fitting. This procedure is schematically shown in Figure 27, where a short EEG signal is used as an example. Finally, one obtains the difference between the original "walk" and the local trend. Denote it by u(n). H is then estimated by
