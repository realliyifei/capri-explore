(p14.0) The identified studies can also be synthesized regarding to which operation of wire harness assembly the proposed vision systems contributed, as shown in Table 6.The majority of previous research discussed computer vision techniques for the assembly procedure, including four studies on the fixing of clamps [13,11,12,30] and seven studies on the mating of connectors [38,10,16,39,40,17,19].The interpretable classification of wire harness branches explored in Kicki et al. [20] and the recognition method for wires proposed in Guo et al. [18] can support the robotic routing with a better understanding of the topology of wire harnesses.Koo et al. [13], Jiang et al. [11], and Jiang et al. [12] proposed to install covers on clamps to facilitate the detection and manipulation of clamps on wire harnesses, which, on the other hand, can also assist the robotic routing of wire harnesses by locating the positions of clamps.However, as summarized in Section 2.1, there are also other operations within the overall wire harness assembly onto vehicles, such as preparation, transport, and disentanglement, which gained little attentions [21].

(p17.0) Computer vision techniques have been implemented in various industrial manufacturing systems to promote the level of informatization, digitization, and intelligence [15].Increasing research efforts in computer vision and robotics have paid attention to the complex DLO manipulation, addressing both theoretical research [52,53,54] and engineering practices [38,12,30,29,18].

(p17.1) However, for robotized wire harness assembly, it is necessary to recognize wire harnesses successfully within a limited processing time in order to conduct planning and control of automated manipulation under constrained production rate [18].Besides, estimating the shape of a wire harness by a totally vision-based algorithm in practical applications in an actual production plant indicates extracting image features from an intricate background [13].On the other hand, the automotive industry has not identified a satisfactory vision-based automation solution that can recognize different components of a wire harness as robustly as humans, especially under hardly consistent production configuration in practical manufacturing, which has attracted plenty of studies on wire harness component recognition in the past few years [13,11,12,30,38,10,16,39,40,17,19,20,18,21].

(p17.2) Previously, clamp detection was achieved with the assistance of clamp covers with a unique design and markers [13,11,12,30].The clamp covers can facilitate the recognition and manipulation of clamps with relatively small sizes and complex structures.However, the clamp covers can be problematic considering the practical assembly of wire harnesses in a vehicle, especially in cramped installation areas.It is also not feasible considering an increasing number of wire harnesses assembled in future products like electric cars.Thus, clamp detection methods without installing additional parts on clamps are desired.

(p17.3) As for connector, recognition was mainly used to provide geometric information to the control system so that the robot could flexibly perceive and manipulate the connectors [38,10,16,39,40,17,19].Previous research mainly adapted 2D image recognition to acquire the positions or orientations of connectors [38,10,16,39,40,19].Tamada et al. [39], using a 2D camera, assumed that all connectors were placed on a flat workbench to reduce the degrees of freedom.However, considering the actual manufacturing scenario, wire harnesses are not fixed on a flat workbench before or during assembly, making the connectors distribute randomly in a 3D space.Thus, the degrees of freedom of connectors cannot be reduced directly.Although an RGB-D camera was adopted, Yumbla et al. [17] acquired the positions of connectors based on 2D image processing and integrated depth information captured by the RGB-D camera to further obtain the 3D measurement of connectors instead of processing depth or other 3D information independently or together with 2D color information.Zhou et al. [19] proposed a shape-based 3D matching method, where CAD models of connectors were registered to the detection results based on 2D connector detection to obtain the 3D information of detected connectors.Considering the increasingly advancing and affordable photography technology and recent development of algorithms in the computer vision community, it is promising to implement depth or other 3D cameras to acquire spatial information and process 3D information directly, which indicates detection and pose estimation of connectors based on 3D information a direction of future research.

(p17.4) Besides, studies on recognition of the wire part [20,18,21] have explored more advanced RGB-D camera or 3D scanner and learning-based algorithms and have demonstrated the performance of 3D vision applications on facilitating a better perception of the structure of wire harnesses, which, on the one hand, creates a possibility for robotized preparation, transport, disentangling, and routing of wire harnesses in the future assembly station, on the other hand, provides references to address computer vision applications on the other components of wire harnesses based on 3D data.
## (s18) Practicality and reliability of vision systems

(p18.0) Although the analyzed articles [13,11,12,30,38,10,16,39,40,17,19,20,18,21] have demonstrated various solutions for achieving different tasks of robotized wire harness assembly under laboratory settings, the practicality and reliability of the state-of-the-art vision system in practical applications remain obscure.Table 7 and Table 8 present the qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted on vision systems in different studies.Yet, few studies considered the issues of practicality and reliability, such as repeatability of the proposal [19] and time cost on the vision system [18].

(p18.1) In a practical manufacturing environment, it is inevitable for the vision system to cope with inconsistent conditions, such as background [13] and illumination [12].Koo et al. [13] revealed the complex background as a non-negligible hindrance for a totally vision-based wire shape estimation in an actual plant.Jiang et al. [12] indicated the lack of vision and laser processing robustness as one of the significant reasons behind experiment failures, for example, the variation of illumination conditions.

(p18.2) From the business perspective, there is also a demand for the processing time of robotized assembly to fulfill the productivity in practical production, which requires the vision system to perceive the state of the object to be manipulated fast enough to allow for a following robot action [64].Jiang et al. [11] demonstrated the technical feasibility of robotized wire harness assembly, but the average speed and reliability were still far from the requirement of practical application.Guo et al. [18] also identified the necessity of promoting time efficiency.Therefore, evaluating the vision system from the perspective of processing time is desired and necessary, which, however, was involved little in previous research [18].

(p18.3) Thus, it is critical to evaluate the practicality and reliability of vision systems regarding different perspectives, such as recognition accuracy, processing speed, and physical facilities in the assembly station, under actual production configurations with various background and illumination conditions.It is also critical for practical application to consider the pay-off of implementing vision systems to automate the wire harness assembly, which affects sustainability from the economic perspective [3,65,60].

(p18.4) Another practical issue that has not been discussed in previous studies [13,11,12,30,38,10,16,39,40,17,19,20,18,21] is the fact that some wire harnesses are installed onto the vehicle frames on a moving production line [14], for which Shi et al. [14] proposed a method for guiding a mobile robot manipulator to assemble wire harnesses onto a moving vehicle with visual servoing.Nevertheless, the processing time and feature engineering are still challenging [14].
