(p0.0) Primary cardiac tumors are extremely rare, with a reported incidence ranging from 0.0017 to 0.019% [1]. Of such tumors, about 75% are benign nature [2,3]. Cardiac fibroma is the second most common primary cardiac tumor in infants and young children after rhabdomyoma [4,5]. Although cardiac fibroma is a benign and solitary tumor [6] composed of fibroblasts and collagen [7,8], it is clinically important as it may present with symptoms such as inflow and outflow obstruction, conduction system disease, and sudden death [9,10]. In contrast to cardiac rhabdomyoma, cardiac fibroma rarely regresses spontaneously [11] and surgical removal in a symptomatic case should be considered [12,13]. Unfortunately, only a few studies have reported the epidemiology, embryology, and histopathology of the cardiac fibroma. Thus, we searched literature databases in July 2011 and selected publications related to cardiac fibroma using a modification of our previously reported method [14] to elucidate the factors predicting poor outcome.
