(p7.0) Some studies are found worthwhile to the current purpose even they did not explicitly focus on the problem of SWP or welding processes' comparison. For instance, Vimal et al. [100] proposed a methodology, which can be used to model, evaluate and implement sustainable manufacturing strategies, and then applied to a single welding process. Alkahla and Pervaiz [101] reviewed a single welding process for sustainability assessment based on a specific sustainability approach. Rivas et al. [102] presented a framework for selecting indicators, and assessing and enhancing the sustainability of manufacturing processes; that was demonstrated with a single welding process.
