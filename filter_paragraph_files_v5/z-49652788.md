## (s12) eory of Planned Behavior (TBP) Concepts.
Number of References: 11

(p12.0) ere were seven articles that addressed beliefs related to knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intent [16,18,24,28,[31][32][33]. e beliefs described in the articles were closely matched with the relevant TPB concepts. e matching of concepts was done by carefully reviewing the definitions of the concepts provided in the articles and how they were measured and matching the terms to the TPB-related concepts. Results are summarized in Table 2. 3.6.1. Attitudes. Overall, two studies showed that there were poor attitudes among providers regarding parents and parents' role in fostering a healthy environment in the FCCH setting [18,24]. For example, some providers believed that although communication with parents is important to get a better understanding of the child's well-being at home, they felt frustrated and reluctant to discuss a child's weight status with parents for fear of offending parents [18]. FCCH providers felt that the nutrition-related CACFP policies were helpful and made a difference in the health of the children attending the FCCHs [18].
## (s13) Subjective Norm.
Number of References: 13

(p13.0) ree studies addressed subjective norms [16,18,28]. ere were inconsistent perceptions of what was considered normal weight among FCCH providers [16,18]. Lindsay et al. showed that despite Hispanic children being disproportionately overweight or obese, Hispanic FCCH providers reported having few children at risk for overweight or obesity or showed no concern about the weight status of the children under their care [18]. ese beliefs, in turn, influenced their belief that portion sizes should be based on age and not on weight [18]. Providers, mostly white, who were presented with drawings of boys and girls of differing sizes, selected smaller sized drawings for girls as a measure for overweight, as compared to the drawing of boys [16]. ese providers reported using more food restriction with girls in the FCCH, than with boys (U � 257.5, p � 0.10) [16]. On the topic of physical activity, most providers believed in the importance of daily physical activity in FCCHs [18]; however, the amount of time providers believed that children should engage in physical activity varied [18]. Additionally, Hispanic providers believed that 50 degrees Fahrenheit was too cold for children to play outside [28]. Although most providers perceived screen time should be limited, focus group discussions pointed to the perception among Hispanic FCCH providers that watching TV was not considered screen time [28].
## (s14) Perceived Behavioral Control.
Number of References: 13

(p14.0) Perceived behavioral control was assessed in all six articles. Lindsay et al. showed that most providers were confident in their abilities to provide a nutritious environment for the children in their care [18]. Providers believed that they had a high level of responsibility to provide a healthy nutritional and physical activity environment and that their role was to nurture and educate the children [16,18,24]. Providers also perceived that they had control over what and how much children eat [18]. Providers felt that they had more influence than centerbased providers on eating habits of children. However, FCCH providers also believed that both the center-based providers and FCCH providers have an equal share of influence on physical activity behavior [32]. Providers identified several enablers or barriers to engaging in nutrition and physical activity best practices. Providers believed that the high cost of food prevented the purchase of quality fresh fruits and vegetables for the children [18]. Lack of space for play was identified as a major barrier to physical activity engagement [18,33]. Additionally, the varying needs for physical activities across ages could be challenging for providers [28,33]. Finally, providers perceived poor parental beliefs to be an obstacle to ensuring best nutrition and physical activity practices in the FCCH [18,28].
## (s15) Behavioral Intent.
Number of References: 17

(p15.0) ree studies addressed providers' perceived strategies to improve the FCCH environment [18,24,28]. Strategies mentioned by providers included encouraging new foods, meal planning, and participating in workshops [18], problem-based solutions-oriented trainings, and programs and resources to address challenging feeding behaviors among children [28], increased reimbursement from CACFP for purchase of nutritious foods [28], improving communication with parents regarding recommended nutrition and physical activity practices [24,28], use of dramatic play during active play time, [24] and having written, comprehensive rules inside the FCCH [24].

(p15.1) 3.6.5. Knowledge. Provider knowledge was addressed in three of the articles [24,28,31]. FCCH providers knew more of the rules on best nutrition practices than center-based providers in the State of Delaware (18 versus 14.7, p < 0.001) [31]. Providers described using their own knowledge on child development to improve what was offered to children in the FCCH [24]. Finally, providers perceived that the CACFP improved their nutrition knowledge [28]; however, this improved knowledge did not help in engaging in best feeding practices due to cultural feeding practices [28].
## (s16) Covariates Included Analyses (Potential Demographic Moderators).
Number of References: 2

(p16.0) Although not directly tested for their moderation effects, this review suggests that there are certain neighborhood, FCCH/facility level, provider, and child-level characteristics that may confound relationships between the environment and EBRBs within the FCCH context. 3.7.1. Neighborhood: Income Zone of Neighborhood. When adjusting for the income zone of the neighborhood in which centers and FCCHs are located, indoor and outdoor physical activity and television-use practices remained significantly different between FCCHs and centers, with fewer FCCH providers providing best practices in these areas (p ≤ 0.05) [20]. For nutritional practices, however, the differences between FCCHs' and centers' nutritional practices were no longer significant when adjusting for the income zone of the neighborhood of the facilities (p � 0.05) [20].
## (s17) FCCH/Facility Level.
Number of References: 6

(p17.0) Four studies reported the number of CACFP-participating FCCHs included in the study sample [22,23,30,31]. Ritchie et al. was the only study that examined the differences in environment between CACFP and non-CACFP homes [22]. CACFP and non-CACFP FCCHs were significantly more likely to serve whole milk than centers (p < 0.001). More non-CACFP homes served candy and sweetened beverages compared to all other types of child care settings including CACFP homes (15.8% non-CACFP homes versus 6.2% CACFP Homes, p < 0.001; 18.4% non-CACFP versus 7.7% CACFP homes, p < 0.001) [22].
## (s18) Provider Level.
Number of References: 5

(p18.0) Hispanic providers were more likely to engage in authoritarian and controlling feeding practices. Freedman et al. found that compared to White and Asian providers, Hispanic providers (representing 76% of study population) were more likely to force children to eat what the providers perceived to be good for them (χ 2 � 7.25, p < 0.05), to insist that the children clean their plates before leaving the table, and to not allow children to eat less than they thought they should and were least likely to sit at the table and eat meals with the children (χ 2 � 3.04, p < 0.05) [17]. Hispanic providers were also three times more likely to cook foods that they knew children liked compared to Asian and White providers (χ 2 � 1.96, p < 0.001) [17]. Brann et al. demonstrated that FCCH providers (84% White) who selected smaller silhouettes for girls as overweight were more likely to have concern about the children's weight, as compared to providers who chose larger silhouettes as representing overweight (U � 235, p < 0.04) [16]. Additionally, providers with higher education had fewer instances of pressuring of children to eat (r � −0.27, p < 0.01) [16]. Kim et al. demonstrated that highly trained FCCH providers were more likely to disseminate healthy nutrition information to children and obesity prevention information to parents [32].
## (s20) Energy Balance-Related Behaviors (EBRBs).

(p20.0) FCCH providers reported offering more fresh fruit and vegetables than center-based child care providers (80.3% versus 51.2%, p < 0.001) and more frequently limiting rolls and bread compared to center-based child care providers (28.1 versus 18.6%, p � 0.001) [20]. However, Trost et al. showed that only 41.7% of FCCH providers served lean meats more than four times per week and less than half of the providers reported serving healthy foods for celebratory events [29]. In the study by Liu et al., fewer FCCH providers reported not offering fried foods compared to center-based providers (38% versus 59%, p � 0.001) [19].

(p20.1) Although FCCH providers reported following best practice recommendations for serving water at least daily and limiting sweetened beverages, 55.8% of the FCCH providers offered 100% juice 3-4 times weekly in Tandon et al. and 66% of FCCH providers in Trost et al. [26,29]. Additionally, only 13.9% of FCCH providers offered 1% milk more than once daily [29]. Natale et al. showed that when compared to center-based child care, fewer FCCH providers provided 1% milk more than once daily (45.2 versus 55%, p � 0.015) [20].

(p20.2) When compared to center-based child care, fewer FCCHs provided outside physical activity for 30 min or more three times a week (92.9% versus 96.5%, p � 0.022) [20]. Children in FCCHs spent on average 5.8 min/hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity and 10.4 min/hour of total physical activity [21]. Although a higher portion of FCCH providers reported preschoolers engaged in 60 min of adultled play time compared to center-based child care (33 versus 18%, p � 0.02), only a third of FCCH providers engaged young children in an hour of playtime [19]. Seventy-eight percent of providers reported that they needed training on how to help children be physically active [19].

(p20.3) Nearly 65% of providers had the TV turned on every day for at least part of the day, and 55.1% of providers allowed children to watch TV or video at least once a day [29]. Natale et al. showed that more FCCH providers reported higher levels of limiting computer time than center-based child care providers (63.9 FCCH versus 51.8% centers, p � 0.003); however, fewer FCCH providers rated excellent in limiting TV or video (39.2%, 59.5%, p < 0.001) [20].
