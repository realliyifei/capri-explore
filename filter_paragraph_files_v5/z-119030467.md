(p0.0) Electrospinning has been shown to be a simple but powerful technique for the preparation of 1D nanostructures (mainly nanofibers; other types of 1D nanostructure, such as nanorods, can be cut from nanofibers by special methods [6,7]). In fact, more than 80% of the total number of papers shown in figure 1 employs this method for the preparation of polymer nanofibers. This is an interesting fabrication process in terms of material diversity, cost, throughput, and the potential for high-volume production.

(p0.1) Polymer nanofibers are produced by using an electrostatically driven jet of polymer solution (or polymer melt) [8]. In an ordinary electrospinning process, the jet is simultaneously pulled, stretched, elongated, and bent by the electric forces. Solvent evaporates rapidly, causing the shell jet to solidify, thus producing nano/micro fibers [9,10].
## (s5) Combination of nanofabrication techniques

(p5.0) Combination of "bottom-up" and "top-down" approaches have been efficiently used in producing functionally important nanoscale materials [16]. Specifically, for the case of 1DPN, block copolymer lithography involves a combination of bottom-up selfassembly and top-down lithographic processes that result in domains with high periodicity (10 nm within a template or highly elaborate patterns) [56]. Self-assembly strategies can also be combined with template approaches to achieve polymeric nanotubes. That is the case of the self-assembly of block copolymers BCPs in AAO membranes which give rise to BCP nanorods and nanotubes that, with a weak base or acid, can easily be released from the template [57]. For example, nanorods of polystyrene-b-polybutadiene (PS-b-PB) and polystyrene-b-poly(methylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) have been successfully prepared within AAO membranes and morphological changes under cylindrical nanoconfinement have been studied [58][59][60]. In addition, nanotubes of polystyrene-b-polyacrylonitrile (PS-b-PAN) and polystyrene-bpoly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) were prepared within AAO membranes and used to generate nanoporous carbon nanotubes [61,62].

(p5.1) The layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method can be regarded as a versatile bottomup nanofabrication technique [63]. In the LbL process, different charged speciespolymeric, colloidal, nano-and microscale-are assembled on a substrate in sequences of alternating charges [64] or other complementary interactions such as hydrogen bonding or host-guest interactions [65]. The fabrication of polymer nanotubes via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of polyelectrolyte solutions employing AAO membranes gives rise to hierarchical nanostructures previously challenging to obtain via other means (e.g., solution-casting, melt-wetting) [66]. There exists an optimum set of conditions (ionic strength, molecular weight) that ultimately control chain dimension relative to geometric dimension The tube wall thickness was found to be thinner or thicker than those assembled on planer surfaces depending on pore size [67,68]. A broad range of polymer materials have been LbL-assembled within the cylindrical nanopores of AAO membranes to yield polymer nanotubes [69].  The formation of the AAO porous honeycombs have been extensively investigated and reported by various groups along the 20 th century, starting by the pioneering works by Keller [72], Thomson [73,74] and others. Nevertheless, AAO drawn the attention from scientist in the nanotechnology arena in 1995, when Masuda and co-workers reported the reaction conditions leading to self-ordering of pores [47] and the subsequent development of a method for achieving ordered AAO templates, i.e.
## (s8) Ordered AAO templates with different pore architectures

(p8.0) The development of AAO templates with complex pore architectures has meant a step further in template-based nanofabrication, as cavities different from the typically HA pulses are alternated without the necessity of electrolyte change [79]. Lee and coworkers [79,105,106] as well as Sulka and coworkers [107,108] have demonstrated that pulse anodization enable a high control of pore diameter modulations in terms of shape and position. Losic et al. reported the "cyclic anodization", in which current profiles in the form of waves were applied to produce the pore modulations [89,109].

(p8.1) Furthermore, spontaneous current oscillations taking place during HA process in oxalic and sulfuric acid electrolytes induce also pore diameter modulations, as reported by Lee at al. [110] and Schwirn et al. [86] (Figure 4b). Branched pores. Ordered AAO templates with Y shaped pores can be produced by a step reduction of the applied voltage (by a factor of 1/âˆš2), as reported by Li and coworkers [111]. The method was further extended to achieve multitetered AAO templates consisting of pores branching into smaller pores in succeeding tiers [112].

(p8.2) Meng and coworkers managed to produce a number of different multibranched pore structures adjusting the voltage step reduction [113,114]. Moreover, exponential reductions of the applied voltage also yield branched pore structures, as has been showed by Chen et al [115].

(p13.0) The "in-situ" polymerization of a monomer in the AAO template (nanoreactor) is an alternative to prepare polymer nanostructures, other than by the infiltration of polymers (nanomolding). In fact, is a complementary way to obtain tailored thermoplastic polymer nanostructures when the polymer infiltration process must be carried out at high temperature and/or for a relatively long time, from hours to days, and the only way to obtain nanostructures from thermoset polymers, for which the polymer infiltration by melting is impossible [162,168,169]. It also offers important advantages in the study of the polymerization kinetics and reaction modelling in confinement, in comparison to other nanoconfined systems since i) each AAO nanocavity is a watertight compartment and, therefore, can be considered as a nanoreactor, ii) the dimensions of AAO nanopores are not only well defined but also easily tailored; and iii) the polymer can also be extracted [170][171][172][173][174]. Moreover, one important fact is the feasibility to directly produce polymer nanostructures for applications. nanotubes were prepared with different composite ratios and it was found that the tubular wall strongly depends on the monomer concentration [175,176] (Figure 13).  Recently, a functional monomer was thermally polymerized inside the anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) channel into nanotubes, which were isolated and characterized to be semiconductive and blue fluorescent, and used as nano-containers of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to form magnetic nanocomposites [183]. Previously, polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes with highly uniform surface and tunable wall thickness were fabricated by one-step vapor deposition polymerization using anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) template membranes and transformed into carbon nanotubes through a carbonization process [184].

(p14.0) In a recent work [168], the polymerization of styrene in the AAO nanotemplates has been carried out as an example of vinyl polymerization by free radicals mechanism.   In the case of free radical polymerization of styrene in AAO nanocavities, the polystyrene nanostructures extracted from the AAO templates have been characterized by SEC and NMR spectroscopy, as a function of the percentage of conversion. Up to 50% conversion, no significant differences in the values of M w or PDI for bulk and confinement polymerization processes were found, which means that the growth radical termination mechanisms is the same in both cases [168]. At high conversion (>65%), it was observed that M w and PDI values are higher for bulk polymerization than nanopolymerization and the difference is more pronounced as the reaction conversion progresses. This behavior was attributed to the better control of the temperature inside of the nanomold, in comparison to the bulk polymerization, where the heat transfer will occur in a very much higher volume. Concerning the steoregularity of the nanostructured polymer, NMR results showed that nanopolymerized PS has a higher degree of syndiotacticity than bulk polymerized. Although the authors cannot attribute this difference to any particular confinement effect, they speculate if the difference in the diffusion of growing chains in confinement with regard to the bulk and/or nanocavities wall obstruction, could favor a kind of regiorigidity of the chain that would allow a rather stereoregular growing. From these results, it is thus evident the influence of nanoconfinement both on the styrene polymerization and the polymer microstructure, therefore, these changes will be accompanied by the variation in the physical properties of the polymer. Nonetheless, considering that confinement and surface effects may not be necessarily identical to all the monomer and polymerization processes, it seems obvious the need of systematic studies of polymerization in confinement, polymer characterization and modelling.

(p15.0) Very recently, Begum et al. [173,188] studied the modeling of methyl methacrylate free radical polymerization in borosilicate nanopores finding that the confinement accelerates the reaction rate as a function of the nanopores size. In contrast, a recent study has found that free radical polymerization of perfluorodecyl acrylate (PFA) in AAO nanopores, showed a significant reduction in the rate of polymerization with respect to the reaction carried out in bulk [162]. The authors considered that the situation observed in this case is similar in nature to dispersed phase polymerizations such as miniemulsion and emulsion polymerization, where the concentration of radicals in the dispersed phase varies depending on the volume of monomer droplets/polymer particles dispersed in water [189,190]. From this assumption a kinetics polymerization model was proposed in which the reaction was confined to a cylindrical space defined by the dimensions of the AAO template used, rather than being confined to droplets A good agreement between the experimental data and the compartmentalized model was obtained while the corresponding bulk free radical polymerization would proceed at a much faster rate. Thus, the current model accurately predicts that as the nanocompartment diameter is decreased the probability of termination is increased due to a higher local radical concentration resulting in a slower rate of polymerization. 
## (s21) Confinement effects on dynamical processes
Number of References: 2

(p21.0) As stated before, finite size effects are considered to originate directly from the hindering of a certain physical process. These effects are due to the fact that the associated length scale of the physical property in question comes into conflict with the dimensions of the material itself. However, the real influence of the size limitation over such processes is often hard to identify and thus has become a matter of controversy among the scientific community [208,209]. One of the main reasons behind that might be the fact that finite size effects are frequently masked by other effects, which are also connected to low dimensionality but cannot be directly ascribed to the hindering of the physical processes due to reduced space. Among such effects are interfacial interactions between polymer molecules and the confining surface, i.e. substrates, pore walls, etc.
## (s29) Surface Properties. Applications as highly adhesive and hydrophobic surfaces

(p29.0) The fabrication of arrays of straight polymeric nanorods with a high aspect ratio constitutes a biomimetic approach for the preparation of highly adhesive surfaces [239][240][241][242][243]. This is based on the fact that these nanostructured surfaces can mimic gecko's foot-hair and provide a similar adhesion [244][245][246]. Gecko toes present arrays of millions of fine hairs with a high aspect ratio (setae), which split into submicron or nanoscale fine termini (spatulae), and these hairs enable geckos to make extensive contact with almost any surface by van der Waals and possibly capillary forces [247,248]. Arrays of branched contact elements have been fabricated by replication of AAO with hierarchical pore morphologies in order to replicate as close as possible the topographic features found in geckos [249,250]. The tip shape in hairy polymer arrays also modulates the adhesion properties of the material. By simple mechanical shaping, flat, foot-like, and pancake-like tip shapes roughly corresponding to three main types of biological contact shapes were accessible. The normal dry adhesion was enhanced in the polymer array with pancake-like tips as can be observed in figure 27. Figure 27. Dependence of F ad on F 1 for PS nanorod arrays with flat tips obtained by cold pressing, foot like tips obtained by shear pressing, and pancake-like tips obtained by hot pressing.

(p29.1) The properties of adhesion can be modulated by different stimuli., i.e. chemical functionality and topography [251], pressure changes [252] or even humidity. As an example, adhesion on arrays of porous fibrillar adhesive pads consisting of the amphiphilic block copolymer PS-b-P2VP can be reversibly switched between lowadhesion states at low humidity and high-adhesion states at high humidity [128].
