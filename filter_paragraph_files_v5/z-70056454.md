(p0.0) Accurate tracking of the orientation of a rigid object is important in several domains, such as sports training, rehabilitation and animation [1][2][3][4]. Several technologies and approaches are available to produce motion tracking systems (trackers). However, most current sensing approaches for motion tracking need the availability of external sources, e.g., cameras for optical trackers, ultrasonic/electromagnetic transmitters for acoustic/electromagnetic trackers. Usually, the sources can operate only over relatively short distances, which makes the trackers highly susceptible to interference and line-of-sight occlusion (shadowing): hence, proper functioning of these trackers is only possible within carefully controlled experimental setups (motion analysis laboratories). This fact precludes, for instance, the quantitative assessment of the behavior of a human subject in unrestrained.
