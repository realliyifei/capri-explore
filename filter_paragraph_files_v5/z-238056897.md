(p0.0) Electrical energy has been regarded as a major industrial source for transmitting and generating power over large distances. The industries are facing challenging issues particularly in the designing of future power systems that delivers huge amount of electricity [1]. The growing electricity demand draws the attention of recent research to focus on renewables. Such growth has been accelerated by the various power system parameters such as frequency response, inertia, battery usage, stability, power loss and efficiency. Further electricity demands and RES must be balanced for maintaining safe, stabilized and dependable operation [2]. Hence it is required to analyse and investigate the impacts of RES in power system operation and control on the basis of the following directions.

(p2.0) Generally, in power-systems, inertia play a significant role in the maintenance of reliability and stability of system by stabilizing the variations in frequency [14]. The conventional synchronous generation sources were displaced by the renewable energy sources that have no intrinsic inertia [15]. Further, several studies examined the impacts of the reduced inertia on various aspects of dynamic stability of the power-systems like oscillatory modes, frequency response and stability [16]. Also, compared the outcomes obtained by inertia reduction technique of the RES with other techniques, where the inertia constant is decreased for all the synchronous generators. In such way, the following articles comprehensively describes about the inertia in power systems and its impacts.

(p4.0) The conventional power systems could contribute the inertia to power systems. Generally, inertia assists to limit the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and the contingency event. However, in the future of power systems, the loads as well as the Renewable energy sources are integrated to the grid via power-electronic converters. Therefore, the inertia of future power systems will be significantly reduced when compared to the conventional power systems. Consequently, the frequency as well as the rate of change of frequency will increase of contingency event arises [21]. Hence, the grid operators cannot maintain the stability of the system with only traditional synchronous generators. The instability problems occurs if the renewable energy system penetration level is equal of more than the synchronous generator's capacity. Additionally, the impact of the damping and lower inertia influences the performance of the grid, thereby leads to the frequency instability issues [22].

(p20.0) It is with a significant importance to provide the more practical, critical and research gaps regarding the RES in power system control and operations [59]. The major issue with RES based power generation is the deviation in the production capacity at various time intervals, flexibility in the selection of location and operation control and the size of individual units [60]. This section identifies the research gap from the existing literatures that enable to prepare various incentive mechanism to overcome the following problems [61]. Some of the constrains in the implementation of solutions to these problems are the requirement of sophisticated information for controlling the load and the source, thermal loading limit and physical circuit constrains and requirement of thermal management for allowing the uninterrupted power flow [62]. The disadvantages of solar PV are the huge installation and high commission cost and a storage process such as batteries [63]. Further the solar PV comprise charge controller, inverter, battery storage and controllable loads. The main disadvantage of wind energy is that it is affected from huge intermittent nature and hence a proper storage mechanism based on artificial intelligence has to be adopted to reduce the overall cost [64].
