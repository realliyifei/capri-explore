(p15.0) Micro-and nanoplastic particles are extremely complex and diverse in terms of their size, shape, density, polymer type, surface properties, etc. [82]. The characterization of micro/macro plastics is important to determine their distribution and impact on the environment. The dense plastic debris in contact collides with a higher impact with sediment particles than lighter microplastics. The variation between these smaller plastics arises due to their multiple shapes, size, origins, and surface characteristics of microplastics. The modern instrument techniques for the characterization of microplastics are Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopies and microscopy; pyrolysis and thermal desorption by gas chromatography and other imaging techniques [21]. For microplastic characterization and identification, mass-based and particlebased techniques are frequently employed. Mass-based techniques include thermal extraction desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TED-GC/MS), Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization -Time of Flight -Mass spectroscopy (MALDI-ToF -MS), quantitative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (qNMR), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) are employed. Particle-based techniques include Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform Infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR), micro -Fourier transform Infrared spectrometry (μ-FTIR), μ-Raman spectroscopy, Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and Time of Flight -Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) [82,83].
