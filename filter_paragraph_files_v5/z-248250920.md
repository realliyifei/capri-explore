(p22.0) Usually, the integration of natural bioreceptors into biosensors causes low stability and durability, since they end up having little resistance to adverse environments such as high temperatures, high pressure and pH variations. In addition to being unstable outside it natural environment, small amounts may exist or even not exist for a given target analyte. Thus, an alternative technique called Molecular Printing has recently emerged, allowing the creation of these structures in an artificial way. It consists of a technology capable of producing polymers provided with specific recognition locations, molded from a template molecule, which may be the analyte itself or a similar structure [82]. Comparing with systems that use natural bioreceptors such as enzymes and antibodies, this technology has advantages such as low cost, robustness, high stability, long-term durability and selectivity [83]. Regarding to the development of alcohol biosensors from molecular imprint polymers (MIPs) as a bioreceptor the literature is limited.

(p22.1) In general, the synthesis process of a MIP includes three main steps: complexation (1); polymerization (2) and extraction (3), as shown in Figure 8. The first step allows the functional monomers to interact with the template molecule, forming a complex (template/monomer) through covalent or non-covalent bonds. The second step concerns the polymerization of the monomers present in the complex through a cross linker, forming a rigid polymer. This polymerization reaction is started after the addition of a radical initiator and the mixing of polymerization usually has a solvent that induces the formation of pores in the polymer (porogenic solvent) giving rise to a rigid polymer matrix. Finally, the third stage deals with the extraction of the template from the polymeric matrix by successive washing processes, in order to break the bonds between the template and the polymeric matrix, giving rise to the specific cavities [84]. These cavities give the MIP the ability to selectively recognize and retain the initial molecule present in any sample complex [82].

(p22.2) During the process of synthesizing a MIP, factors such as stoichiometric ratios of the components, temperature and time of the polymerization reaction have a significant impact on chemical and morphological properties features exhibited by the MIP, and, therefore, all these variables must be carefully studied in order to obtain maximum efficiency [83,84].

(p22.3) The template molecule must fulfill a set of requirements, namely it be chemically inert; remain stable at moderately elevated temperatures or upon to exposure to UV radiation; and it may not have groups that accelerate or retard polymerization (e.g., thiol) as well as polymerizable groups, since these promote the non-formation of recognition cavities. Furthermore, this component should be able to bond with the functional monomer otherwise there will be no printing [83]. During the process of synthesizing a MIP, factors such as stoichiometric ratios of the components, temperature and time of the polymerization reaction have a significant impact on chemical and morphological properties features exhibited by the MIP, and, therefore, all these variables must be carefully studied in order to obtain maximum efficiency [83,84].
