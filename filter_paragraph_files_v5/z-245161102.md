## (s2) Advantages and Limitations of VES-Based Fluids
Number of References: 2

(p2.0) VES solutions have a number of advantages over polymer fracturing fluids [24]. They arise from the fact that, in contrast to polymer chains, the wormlike surfactant micelles are labile structures formed by the self-assembly of small molecules due to weak non-covalent interactions. Therefore, they are dynamic and are able to break and recombine [45]. This imparts reversible shear-thinning to the VES solutions: their viscosity decreases by several orders of magnitude under shear, which is explained by the alignment and breaking of the WLMs in flow, but completely restores at rest. This property is very important in hydraulic fracturing operations to facilitate the pumping of the fluid into the well.
## (s3) Oligomeric Surfactants

(p3.0) One of the approaches to increasing the strength of micellar networks for hydraulic fracturing applications is the use of oligomeric surfactants [50]. These surfactants consist of several hydrophobic tails (n) and hydrophilic heads (m) covalently linked to each other [51]. Such molecules exhibit stronger hydrophobic interactions, which enhance micellization, resulting in lower CMC values and smaller amounts of non-aggregated free surfactant, the lower surfactant concentrations necessary to form WLMs, and higher micellar scission energies and more stable micelles.

(p3.1) With regard to the example of cationic surfactant oligomers with quaternary ammonium heads, it was demonstrated that with an increase in the number of units in the oligomer (n), the CMC decreases, and the packing of surfactant molecules in the micelles becomes denser [52]. With an increase in n from 2 to 4, a transition occurs first from the spherical to the cylindrical micelles, which is accompanied by a significant increase in viscosity, and then to the ring-like micelles. Longer alkyl spacer-(CH 2 ) s -between head groups of quaternary ammonium gemini surfactants also decreases the CMC [53]. An increase in the concentration of dimeric or trimeric surfactants leads to a transition from spherical aggregates to cylindrical and then to long WLMs, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations [54,55].
