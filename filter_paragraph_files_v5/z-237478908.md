(p11.0) Neurological side effects mainly result from excessive activation of nicotinic receptors. Common neurological adverse effects are dizziness, dyskinesia, convulsion, muscle cramps, insomnia, and vivid dream. The epileptic seizure is a very rare neurological adverse effects induced by AChEIs. 160,161 From previous report, patient with mild AD treated with 10 mg donepezil once daily for 3 weeks presented convulsions during the treatment. 160 Moreover, AChEI-induced seizures may result from nutritional and metabolic disorders such as hyponatremia. 161 The vivid dream results from the disorder of brainstem cholinergic systems in processing rapid eye movement sleep. One characteristic of the vivid dream is extremely realistic. Vivid dreams usually appear in patients treated with donepezil in the evening owing to peak plasma concentration at night. 63,162 Psychiatric adverse outcomes in older adults treated with AChEIs may include worsening of hallucination, anxiety, aggression, and confusion. 163, 164 Psychiatric problems are usually presented in dementia patients treated with high doses of AChEIs.

(p19.0) The BBB is a highly selective semipermeable layer of endothelial cells which limits the access of water-soluble and large molecules transporting from blood circulation into the brain parenchyma. Older adults with dementia have changes in the permeability and integrity of the BBB, as presented in Table 2. BBB mechanism includes reabsorption of CSF and efflux pumps for molecules such as p-glycoprotein (P-gp) which assists the maintenance of hemostasis in the brain and in the clearance of betaamyloid. 43,101,102 P-gp is a phosphorylated protein encoded by multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) and belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporters. 102,212 It is located on the apical surface of endothelial cells and is involved in limiting the transfer of small molecules into the brain. 213,214 With aging process and dementia, levels and activity of P-gp have a tendency to decline. 101,102,181,215 Furthermore, micro-disruption of the BBB is found in patients with dementia, contributing to increased allowance of some medications across BBB around the disruption areas. 181 These changes may lead to increased permission of AChEIs to the brain as a predisposing factor of AChEIinduced ADRs in this population. 43

(p28.0) Ruangritchankul et al of donepezil is safe and the use of its doubling dose should be monitored. 264 Galantamine is a daily oral medication ranging from 8 to 24 mg per day, 116 as shown in Supplementary  Table 1. Galantamine doses must be adjusted for people with moderate hepatic impairment. Furthermore, galantamine should not be recommended to patients with severe liver and kidney dysfunction. Rivastigmine may be a good choice for older demented patients exposed to polypharmacy to reduce the incidence of PK drug interactions related to CYP enzymes. Rivastigmine prescriptions start at 1.5 mg and could be gradually increased to 6 mg twice a day, 64
