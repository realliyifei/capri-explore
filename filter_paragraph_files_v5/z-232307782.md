## (s19) .1 The existence of prescribed acyclic spanning subdigraphs
Number of References: 2

(p19.0) It is well known that a tournament T contains an x− y Hamiltonian path if and only if there is an acyclic spanning subdigraph R (not necessarily induced) such that for each vertex z of T , R contains an x − z path and a z − y path [60]. Bang-Jensen and Huang [13] proved that if a quasitransitive digraph has both in-and out-branchings then it always contains such an acyclic spanning subdigraph. For semicomplete compositions, we give the following sufficient condition to guarantee the existence of this type of subdigraph. Theorem 6.1 Let Q = T [H 1 , . . . , H t ] be a semicomplete composition. Then it contains an acyclic spanning subdigraph R with a source x and a sink y such that for each vertex z of Q, R contains an x − z path and a z − y path, if one of the following assertions holds:
