## (s1) Epidemiology
Number of References: 11

(p1.0) The earliest described case of hypophysitis is from 1962. Goudie and Pinkerton presented a 22-year-old postpartum woman who died of circulatory shock with hypothyroidism and amenorrhea [14,18,19]. Although this is the earliest credited description, it is likely that some of Sheehan's original patient series from the early 1900s included patients with the diagnosis [14]. Historically, almost all cases were delineated as idiopathic because the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms were unknown [5]. The most commonly referenced incidence of this disorder is 1 in 9 million persons annually, however, this estimate comes from a single-center study conducted over 2 decades ago that only accounted for lymphocytic and granulocytic forms of hypophysitis [3,5,20]. It is likely this is an underestimation. The true prevalence and incidence of hypophysitis has grown exponentially over past decade in part due to increased awareness of the condition, better imaging, and increased reporting of IgG4-and immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypophysitis [3,5]. The average age of presentation is 31 years for women and 42 years for men. The duration of symptoms is between 1 month and 5 years, and the onset of hypopituitarism is more rapid in lymphocytic hypophysitis versus adenomas [19].
## (s4) Lymphocytic
Number of References: 13

(p4.0) The lymphocytic subtype represents more than 70% of all cases of hypophysitis and has a well-established pathogenesis [5]. It is more common in women, with most cases reported during late pregnancy or the early postpartum period. It mainly affects the anterior pituitary [5]. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficiency is common [16]. The proposed relationship between hypophysitis and pregnancy is related to pituitary hyperplasia during the gestational period increasing pituitary antigens and alterations in hypophyseal blood flow. This results in increased pituitary blood supply and greater exposure to the immune system [5]. Lymphocytic panhypophysitis and infundibuloneurohypophysitis do not have the same sex distribution and relationship to pregnancy. Cases of pediatric patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis have been documented; these patients can present with DI and amenorrhea [21].

(p4.1) Lymphocytic hypophysitis usually results in a solid enlargement of the pituitary gland; cystic components are less likely [18]. Histopathologically, there is extensive infiltration of lymphocytes, predominantly T cells, into the interstitium, with additional B cells, plasma cells, and occasional eosinophils, macrophages, histiocytes, and masts cells present [14]. If left untreated, the result is fibrosis. On autopsy, patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis demonstrate a significantly atrophied, fibrous pituitary gland adhering to the dura with secondary atrophy of the adrenal glands [18,21,22].

(p4.2) Lymphocytic hypophysitis is associated with other autoimmune diseases in approximately 20% of cases. These may include Hashimoto thyroiditis, diabetes mellitus type 1, hypoparathyroidism, Graves disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, pernicious anemia, alopecia, myasthenia gravis, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic atrophic gastritis, and nonorgan-specific conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus [9]. A Rathke cleft cyst is an uncommon sellar lesion of Rathke pouch origin. Usually, these lesions remain asymptomatic, but they can rupture and cause secondary lymphocytic hypophysitis, so it is important to consider lymphocytic hypophysitis after the rupture of a Rathke cleft cyst when doing diagnostic imaging [23]. Serum anti-pituitary antibodies might be present, but they lack specificity and are present in other autoimmune disorders that have no pituitary involvement at all [3].
## (s11) COVID-19
Number of References: 4

(p11.0) Pituitary apoplexy is a known rare phenomenon that can occur after infection with COVID-19. Additionally, there are several case reports of DI that have been described in patients weeks after COVID-19 infection [33]. Recently, there have been reports in the literature of hypophysitis related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the vaccine. Ankireddypalli et al. [34] reported a woman who experienced severe, persistent headache, myalgias, polyuria, and polydipsia two days after COVID-19 vaccination. MRI was obtained, and a thickened pituitary stalk was identified. The patient was diagnosed with DI and hypophysitis. Symptoms improved on 3-month follow-up, however, the thickened pituitary stalk remained. Additionally, there are reports of hypophysitis occurring between 2 weeks and 2 months after COVID-19 infection. Patients began experiencing headaches, laboratory-identified hypothyroidism, hypocortisolism, hypogonadism, and MRI supported a diagnosis of hypophysitis [35,36]. Although this is a rare complication, signs and symptoms of hypophysitis after a recent COVID-19 infection or vaccine should warrant appropriate investigation.
## (s12) Paraneoplastic Syndrome
Number of References: 8

(p12.0) Hypophysitis caused by a paraneoplastic autoimmune reaction is another novel clinical entity. The presence of various ectopic proteins expressed in tumors, such as pituitary transcription factors or hormones, can lead to the formation of autoantibodies and autoreactive cytotoxic T cells [37]. Pit-1 is a transcription factor required for the differentiation, proliferation, and maintenance of pituitary somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs [12]. Primary tumors like thymoma and bladder lymphoma can cause a paraneoplastic syndrome [5,37], and anti-Pit1-hypophysitis will lead to growth hormone, prolactin, and TSH deficiencies with detectable circulating anti-PIT1 antibodies [12]. A proposed diagnostic algorithm from Yamamoto et al. [38] suggests three criteria to identify anti-Pit1-hypophysitis: acquired growth hormone, TSH, and prolactin deficiencies without impairment of other pituitary axes; presence of anti-PIT1 antibodies or PIT1-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes; and an underlying diagnosis of thymoma or malignant neoplasm [5,37].
## (s13) Autoimmune and Local Infiltrative Disease
Number of References: 4

(p13.0) Primary hypophysitis is associated with another autoimmune disease in approximately 25-50% of cases. The most common autoimmune diseases that appear in concert with hypophysitis include Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, Addison disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, atrophic gastritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, Erdheim-Chester disease, and autoimmune hepatitis [14]. Immune processes likely target specific pituitary cell subtypes, and loss of ACTH-, follicle stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone-, or TSH-secreting cells is seen [14].

(p13.1) Hypophysitis secondary to pituitary abscess is rare, but can be life threatening [11]. Most commonly, these cases are of bacterial origin; however, rarely, fungal infections, such as aspergillosis and coccidioidomycosis can affect the pituitary. Abscesses can cause anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies or central DI. Growth hormone deficiency is the earliest manifestation, followed by deficient gonadotropic hormones, then TSH and ACTH deficiencies [11].
## (s17) Symptomatology
Number of References: 10

(p17.0) Hypophysitis can present as acute, subacute, or chronic [14]. Many symptoms of hypophysitis also occur in apoplexy and tumors, but sudden-onset endocrine deficiencies and presence of DI are more suggestive of nonadenomatous sellar lesions [11,20]. Pituitary tumors tend to cause isolated growth hormone or gonadotrophic dysfunction, whereas isolated ACTH or TSH deficit more likely has an inflammatory and autoimmune cause [14]. Endocrine symptoms or neurological symptoms due to mass effect are common [20]. These include headache, nausea, visual disturbances, diplopia, cranial nerve 3, 4, and 6 neuropathies, hydrocephalus, and mental status changes [11,46]. Carotid artery occlusion and symptoms that mimic meningitis or pituitary apoplexy are consequences of extensive mass effect [2,14,46].
