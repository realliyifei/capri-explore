(p2.0) Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations of Behçet's disease are of particular importance as they are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. GI manifestations usually occur 4.5-6 years after the onset of oral ulcers [14] . The most common symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding [15] . Although ileocecal involvement is most commonly described, BD may involve any segment of the alimentary tract and the various GI organs [14,16] . In general, two forms of intestinal Behçet's disease exist -neutrophilic phlebitis that leads to mucosal inflammation and ulcer formation and large vessel disease (i.e., mesenteric arteries) that results in intestinal ischemia and infarction [17] . The frequency of GI involvement among patients with BD varies in different countries. Lower frequency has been reported in Turkey (2.8%), India (3.4%) and Saudi Arabia (4%), moderate frequency in China (10%) and Taiwan (32%) and the highest frequency has been reported in the United Kingdom (38%-53%) and Japan (50%-60%) [12,16,[18][19][20][21] . It is imperative that the clinician caring for patients with BD is aware of the myriad of clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods and treatment strategies available for the gastrointestinal manifestations of BD.
## (s7) VISCERAL ARTERIAL INVOLVEMENT

(p7.0) BD is a unique form of vasculitis because it can involve arteries and veins of all sizes [69] . One study of 38 BD patients with vascular involvement found that venous involvement was by far the most prevalent (88%) [70] . Incidence of vascular involvement varies between 7%-29% [71] . Males are more commonly affected [72] . Arterial manifestations include formation of aneurysms and luminal thrombi [64] . Important sites of arterial involvement include the arteries of the upper and lower extremities (radial, femoral, popliteal) [73] , pulmonary artery [74] and thoracoabdominal aorta [75] . Other sites of involvement include the subclavian [76] , iliac [77] , carotid [78,79] , renal [80] and coronary arteries [81] . Arterial involvement of the intra-abdominal organs is rare. When it occurs, patients may present with fever, abdominal pain or pulsatile mass. Complications can include intestinal infarction and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Very few cases of visceral aortic aneurysm exist in the literature -involvement of the celiac trunk [82] , superior mesenteric [83] , hepatic [84] , splenic [85] , inferior mesenteric [86] and ileocolic artery [87] have been described.
## (s9) PANCREAS

(p9.0) Pancreatic involvement in BD is exceptionally rare. Very few case reports of acute pancreatitis have been attributed to BD [55,56] . Chronic pancreatitis was also reported in a patient with BD -however he also had a history of heavy alcohol intake [57] . It is possible that pancreatic involvement is underreported or underdiagnosed -an autopsy series of 170 cases from Japan suggested 2.9% involvement of the pancreas [58] . Vasculitis is likely the underlying pathological process leading to pancreatic inflammation -this theory is further supported by other vasculitic syndromes such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis which has also been associated with pancreatitis [59] .
## (s13) MEDICAL MANAGEMENT

(p13.0) Management of Behçet's syndrome is challenging because of a general lack of high quality evidence [92] . Although some controlled data exists for management of arthritis, eye involvement and mucocutaneous disease, there is a considerable lack of evidence addressing treatment strategies for neurologic and vascular manifestations. Similarly, there are no internationally accepted, standardized treatment strategies for gastrointestinal BD. In order to standardize treatment, the Japanese Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Group proposed a set of consensus statements in 2007 -they were updated again in 2014 to address growing lowlevel evidence supporting the use of anti-TNF-α mAb therapy [93,94] . Generally, with some exceptions, the same classes of medications that have been used for the treatment of systemic BD have also been used to treat intestinal BD and include colchicine, 5-ASA/ sulfasalazine, corticosteroids (CS), immunomodulators, immunosuppressants, IFNα and anti-TNF-α mAb therapy. Table 4 summarizes the highest level of evidence for each modality of therapy.
## (s16) SURGICAL MANAGEMENT
Number of References: 9

(p16.0) As in patients with IBD, surgical therapy is reserved for those who are refractory to medical therapy or presenting with severe gastrointestinal bleed. Other indications for surgery include perforation, fistula formation, intestinal obstruction and abdominal mass [117] . It is interesting to note that ileal disease and ocular lesions are associated with increased risk of surgical resection [118] . There is controversy over the type of surgical procedure and length of bowel to remove. Traditionally, right hemicolectomy, ileocolectomy and partial resection of the small bowel are most commonly performed. Chou et al [41] recommended up to 80 cm of ileal resection from the ileocecal valve at the time of right hemicolectomy More recently, authors suggest a conservative approach with removal of only the grossly involved bowel as there appears to be no relation between length of resection and rates of recurrence or reoperation [117] . For select BD patients who undergo surgery, creation of a stoma may be preferable over primary anastomosis given a high rate of intestinal leakage, perforation and fistulization at the anastomosis site [14,42] . Reoperation in those who undergo surgery is high -30%-44% and often occurs at or near the anastomosis site (similar to CD) [117][118][119] . Independent predictors of reoperation include history of postoperative steroid therapy, CRP levels greater than 4.4 or endoscopic evidence of "volcano-type" deep ulcers.
