(p0.0) Since the last two decades, people suffering from OAB syndrome/ symptom has increased enormously worldwide and is anticipated that it will cross 546 million populations by 2018. The annual worldwide healthcare cost for OAB is enhanced from €1.4 trillion to € 3.2 trillion by 2018. Though the percentage of both male and female patients is most similar it is slightly more in women population [1]. In the initial phase of OAB syndrome, individual may not understand the indication of urine urgency which may occure due to the large volume of liquid intake, any physical exertion, stress-induced or any other defect occurred in the body functioning. At the initial stage, it is very difficult for both patient and physician to identify the symptoms of OAB [2]. Thus, making a note on the diary with date and time with respect to fluid intake, voiding and urine leakage will help to identify the symptoms of OAB. For physicians, it is necessary to evaluate the basic and clinical impact and get a detailed patient history to diagnose OAB. In clinical practice, the syndrome of OAB can be defined as a condition which is characterized by urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with urinary frequency and nocturia [3]. Debbie Kinsey and colleagues revealed that the patients suffered from OAB are psychologically very disturbed and lived a lower quality of life than normal people [4]. This review article provides an insight of the neural control, bladder physiology, regulation of micturition in a normal individual and also disrupt the mechanism of micturition in OAB patients along with the risk factors, prevalence, assessment, management and future perspective of OAB. For this review article, an extensive literature survey was carried out on search engines including Pubmed, Science Direct, Google scholar by referring keywords as subsections mentioned in this article and collect the information available tentatively from year 1980.
## (s3) Factors responsible for risk of OAB

(p3.0) Problems associated with urinary tract infections may lead to impermanent bladder symptoms, which are recoverable. Progressive age is a prominent factor which is more likely to contribute in OAB symptoms. Other reasons for OAB are neurological changes; the drag of gravity or weight may cause pelvic base organs to prolapse and susceptible to urinary tract infection because of the weaker immune system [34][35][36]. In women, a significant drop in estrogen level observed after menopause, which results in thinner and drier tissues of bladder, urethra, and pelvic muscle atrophy may be the cause that leads to urgency and frequency of urination [37]. Some conditions like pregnancy and childbirth, disease of the nervous system, bladder cancer, pelvic surgery, enlargement of the prostate, urinary tract infection, overweight, medications like diuretics, sedatives, antidepressants, certain occupations like teaching, nursing, police officers, truck/bus driving, etc. may cause the risk of OAB.
## (s4) Prevalence of OAB

(p4.0) Progressive age is a primary cause for the increase in the prevalence of OAB [36,38,39]. As per Milsom, OAB symptoms are more prevalent in European countries like France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and UK using a random and stratified approach [36]. In this study, the general population of men and women aged over and equal to 40 y were selected and younger women showed more OAB signs than men whereas the reverse condition was observed in the aged population. There was no significant difference in the overall prevalence reported in women and men of 16.9% and 16.0% respectively when compared the complete population of both. In these six European countries total 22 million people will be suffered from OAB if extrapolated to the total population of above 40 y of age. Irwin conducted a separate study which estimates globally and specific area of a base number of people suffered from OAB in 2008 and predicted for 2018 with the support of their own EPIC study [1]. EPIC study was a telephonic survey of 19,165 men and women in 5 regions [38]. According to this study in 2008, 455 million people experienced OAB worldwide and an anticipated increase to 546 million (20.1%) till 2018. In 2008, the global prevalence was more in women (11.6%) than men (9.7%) and also anticipated the similar way in 2018 (11.9% vs 10.0%). Asia is the most OAB affected region than Europe followed by Africa, North America and South America. From 2008 to 2018, there will be an increase in OAB patients in Asia, South America and Africa as 22.1%, 22.4% and 31.1% respectively. Based on the published economic model [40], it was extrapolated that the normal global yearly treatment cost of OAB will be €1.4 trillion to € 3.2 trillion by 2018 [1]. Other than EPIC and Milsom study, some other studies were also conducted by some agencies on the prevalence of OAB like National Overactive Bladder Evaluation study and The Epidemiology of Lower Urinary Tract symptoms [35].
## (s8) Anticholinergic or antimuscarinics drug
Number of References: 14

(p8.0) As described in the first section of this review, the parasympathetic postganglionic nerves, releases neurotransmitter acetylcholine, this binds to the muscarinic receptor M3 on the detrusor muscle which results to the contraction of the bladder [9,18]. In OAB patient, during the bladder filling, the anticholinergic drugs competitively inhibit acetylcholine binding to M3 receptor as shown in fig. 1 and avoid instinctive tightening of the bladder. Secondly, anticholinergic drugs inhibit potentially urothelial sensory receptors and decrease afferent nerve activity, i.e. sensory inputs from the bladder [41,42,[47][48][49][50][51]. These drugs enhance the capacity of the bladder at the first automatic contraction response [2,47,52]. Since the anticholinergic drugs act competitively, the immense discharge of acetylcholine during urination will curtail the active moiety consequence and detrusor muscle squeezes [42]. The selective anticholinergic drugs have more affinity for the M3 receptor and therefore may reduce the side effects associated with these drugs [35].
## (s14) Desmopressin acetate

(p14.0) It is a synthetic analogue of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) vasopressin which is formed by the hypothalamus and preserved in the posterior pituitary gland [2,64]. The primary role of ADH is to control extracellular fluid volume in the body. Desmopressin acts on the kidneys by reducing the amount of urine produced at night and also responsible for re-absorption of water by kidney [65,66]. Desmopressin acts by imitating the ADH role. Due to hyponatremia, the nasal dosage form is no more indicated for primary enuresis [2,65,67]. As such desmopressin is a safe medicine with less side effects such as a headache, stomach ache and occasional emotional disturbance [68].
## (s15) Tricyclic antidepressants
Number of References: 6

(p15.0) Imipramine and amitriptyline have been used for OAB treatment due to their multiple actions as an anticholinergic as well as an alpha-agonist action [2,69,70]. Their antimuscarinic activity is feebler than the others of the same category. There is a limitation of imipramine use amongst the old aged patients for OAB syndrome [70]. However, it has been mentioned that due to the central effect of the automatic emptiness, imipramine has been suggested to combine with the urge-stress incontinence especially in older women [34]. The side effects observed are vast including dry mouth, constipation, stomach pain, nausea, cardiac arrhythmias, urinary retention and drowsiness [35].
