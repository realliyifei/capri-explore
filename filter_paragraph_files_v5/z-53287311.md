(p14.0) Better spectrum utilization is considered as one of the key targets in wireless communication. VANETs use a limited spectrum, for instance, 75 MHz at the 5.9 GHz band. Better use of this spectrum enables to increase the capability of network bandwidth and throughput. In VANET protocol stack "Wireless Access for Vehicular Environment (WAVE)", the available bandwidth is divided into service and control channels, as shown in Fig. 5 [44][45][46].
