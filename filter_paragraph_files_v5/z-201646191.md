## (s2) Environmental Sound Synthesis Using Sound Event and Scene Labels
Number of References: 4

(p2.0) When providing movies or games with background sounds or sound effects, we need to listen to many sounds in a large sound database and select the most suitable one for the scene or sound event, which is a time-consuming part of movie or game production. To address this issue, a statistical method for synthesizing an environmental sound well representing a sound event or scene, which utilizes the sound event or scene labels as below as an input, has been proposed [10]. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the processes of environmental sound synthesis using the sound event or scene labels as the inputs of the systems, where we call these research tasks sound event synthesis (SES) and sound scene synthesis (SSS), respectively. Another issue is that the construction of an environmental sound dataset is very time-consuming compared with the construction of a speech or music dataset [11]. In recent studies, environmental sound analysis based on deep neural networks has required a large number of sounds to achieve a reasonable performance. To overcome this problem of a shortage of environmental sound datasets, SES and SSS can be applied for data augmentation in environmental sound analysis.

(p2.1) To generate environmental sounds by a statistical approach, Kong et al. [10] have proposed a method of environmental sound synthesis utilizing a conditional SampleRNN [12] with sound scene labels represented as one-hot vectors.
