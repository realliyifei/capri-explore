(p0.0) Postharvest diseases represent a major problem through the world causing significant losses at postharvest stage [1]. Postharvest treatments play an important role in the quality preservation of commodities; however, in developed countries, the inadequate storage and transportation systems favor the establishment of diverse pathogens [2]. Traditionally, postharvest disease management is carried out by the application of chemical fungicides; however, environmental and health issues as well as microbial resistance play an important role in the development 4. Alternative methods for controlling postharvest diseases 4

(p13.0) The ability to induce resistance in a wide range of diseases caused by various classes of pathogens (including fungi, bacteria, and viruses) in a wide variety of plants may be an important characteristic of Trichoderma [56]. Currently, three classes of compounds are known that are produced by Trichoderma strains and that induce resistance in the plant. These are proteins with enzymatic functions, homologs of proteins encoded for avirulence (Avr), and oligosaccharides.
