(p4.0) Breast cancer originates from the aberrant proliferation of cells in breast tissue, resulting in the development of diverse lesion types, such as asymmetry between the left and right breasts, tissue structure distortion, and the presence of microcalcifications (MCs) and lumps in varying sizes and shapes (34). Breast masses and microcalcifications are prevalent types of lesions encountered in clinical practice. MCs are small calcium deposits commonly found in the breast, appearing as bright spots on mammograms (35). While individual MCs are not highly indicative of breast cancer detection, the formation of microcalcification clusters through the aggregation of microcalcifications serves as an important early sign of breast cancer. Microcalcification clusters, consisting of three or more calcification points per centimeter, can lead to a preliminary diagnosis of early breast cancer. Thus, the detection of microcalcification clusters holds significant value in the early examination of breast cancer. Lumps typically manifest as relatively dense areas (off-white areas) on mammograms. Benign lumps exhibit a round, smooth, and well-circumscribed appearance, while suspicious lumps display irregular, rough, and blurred borders (35).

(p5.0) Duarte et al. (36) demonstrated a technique for segmenting microcalcifications by combining geodesic active profiles with anisotropic texture filtering. The images undergo preprocessing through Alternating Sequential Filtering, and contrast enhancement is achieved using Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technology. The image set utilized in the system is extracted from the DDSM database. This technique achieved an average area overlap measurement of 0.52 Â± 0.20, encompassing 87.4% of malignant cases and 86.4% of benign cases. Guo (37) et al. described a system for detecting microcalcified clusters present in digital mammogram images. The zone growth method was employed to eliminate artifacts in mammal X images. The top hat transform and grayscale adjustment methods are utilized for contrast enhancement. The contourlet transform is employed to identify suspicious regions in the breast X image. Calcified clusters are detected using unlinked pulse-coupled neural networks. The proposed system achieved a good accuracy of 95.8%, sensitivity of 96.3%, and specificity of 94.7% when tested on the MIAS and JSMIT databases, respectively. In the (38) study, the researchers proposed a CAD system for mammography microcalcification detection based on a new feature set. They employed statistical observations of classical features (such as higher-order statistics, discrete wavelet Workflow of computer-aided diagnosis of mammographic images. Recently, the detection of microcalcification points in mammography has gained significant attention as a challenging research area. Despite numerous methods proposed for detecting microcalcification points. However, due to the complex structure of mammography X-ray images, uneven background, and the presence of noise similar to microcalcifications, the detection of microcalcification points still poses certain challenges. Current methods have not yielded satisfactory results, with routine examinations missing 10-30% of cases (41). Hence, researchers should prioritize the development of new technologies to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting microcalcification points in the breast. Additionally, most studies continue to rely on breast image databases from Europe and North America, resulting in a limited number of studies focused on dense mammary X-ray images. Furthermore, there is currently no standardized breast image database suitable for Asian women researchers. Therefore, establishing a standardized breast image database specifically tailored for Asia is an urgent concern.

(p15.0) The rapid development of DL and the significant improvement in computer performance have made DL a prominent research area for analyzing and processing medical images to aid in lesion diagnosis. Traditional computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems lack deep networks and can only extract shallow features, resulting in poor system performance. DL, on the other hand, can automatically extract informative features from medical images, including those that may not be easily visible to the naked eye. This capability greatly enhances the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in the context of breast lesion diagnosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that DL applied to breast cancer screening is approaching the diagnostic proficiency of experienced radiologists (81).. However, the challenge of relying on ROI annotation in DL techniques has yet to be effectively addressed. Therefore, further research should be conducted to explore DL techniques that reduce the dependency on ROI annotation. However, the challenge of relying on ROI annotation in DL techniques has yet to be effectively addressed. Therefore, further research should be conducted to explore DL techniques that reduce the dependency on ROI annotation. Some researchers (82,83) have employed various DL techniques to detect and classify suspicious areas in mammography images, resulting in improved model performance to some extent. Moreover, considering that DL training and validation sets require extensive data, the creation of a large publicly available dataset with high accuracy, resolution, and diversity becomes necessary. This dataset will facilitate the training of CAD models with superior performance. Consequently, the integration of DL into mammography CAD systems represents a promising direction for advancing computer-aided diagnosis technology for mammography images.
