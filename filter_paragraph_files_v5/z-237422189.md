## (s6) Relationship between colonization and clinical infection (SSIs rate).
Number of References: 9

(p6.0) Three articles (17,18,20) show that there is no significant difference between colonized and non-colonized children regarding the SSIs rate (17,18,20).  The impact of SSIs in terms of costs for the healthcare system. One article (11) deals with this topic. The study of Sochet et al. (2017) is the first to value the hospital cost associated with SSIs following pediatric congenital heart surgery, showing an increased operational and departmental cost. The SSIs increase the length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, and this exposes children to a greater risk of catheter-associated blood infections, venous thromboembolism, accidental extubations, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and adverse events (11).
