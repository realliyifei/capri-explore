(p16.0) The ADC is the block that receives the sampled output of the AFE as input and generates IR-dependent digital words as output. There are many ADC types and architectures to be used in the micro-bolometer framework. One of the simplest ways, for instance, is to use the integrator already present in the system (both with a voltage or a current mode approach) to implement a single-slope A/D conversion [3,14,17,50]. The output ramp of the integrator is compared with a reference voltage; a change in the input signal impacts the slope of the output ramp, which results in a different time needed for the signal to cross a comparator's threshold. Since a digital counter starts counting at the beginning of the integration process, at the triggering of the comparator, the counter content will be a digital representation of the input signal. Another commonly used ADC type is the Successive Approximation Register (SAR) converter [7,18,34,51], in which the subsequent decisions of a comparator about the polarity of the AFEs output with respect to a reference are processed to obtain IR-dependent digital codes. This approach features, particularly fast conversions, but its resolution is typically limited by the presence of thermal noise (10). To overcome this issue, an oversampling approach can be considered by employing Σ∆ converters operating in incremental mode [52] in accordance with the multiplexing requirements discussed before.
