(p6.0) In this literature study, there were 20 studies that discussed social factors that affect the occurrence of depression in the elderly. The social factors were social/emotional support, education level, financial problem, marital status, lack of contact with family/friends, living alone, dependency, environmental and religious beliefs. According to three from 12 that examined social support, social support was associated with depression. Research conducted by Bui (2020) found that there was a reciprocal relationship between social support and depressive symptoms, with p<0.001 (Bui, 2020). Meanwhile, research by Piboon (2012) found that there was a positive relationship between social support and depression (Piboon et al., 2012). Chen et al. found in their research that social frailty may be a predictor of depression among community-dwelling older adults .
