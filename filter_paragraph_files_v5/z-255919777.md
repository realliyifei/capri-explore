(p0.0) Cannabis sativa, commonly known as cannabis (Family: Cannabaceae), is one of the oldest crops cultivated and has various religious and medicinal values [1]. Nondrug assortment of cannabis is popularly known as hemp, often used in food and textile industries [2].

(p0.1) The genus Cannabis is taxonomically classified into three different species: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. The sativa and indica species are primarily developed owing to their medicinal and commercial benefits compared to ruderalis [3]. Cannabis is known to yield more than 400 chemicals [4] of different classes, out of which 144 are cannabinoids with pharmacologically varying effects [5]. The most notable ones are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the major psychoactive compound, while CBD is the nonpsychoactive moiety [6].

(p3.0) In the central nervous system, high CB1 distribution is present in regions of olfactory bulbs (inner granule and inner plexiform layer) [41,42], forebrain regions of cerebral neocortex frontal lobe (II, III, V, VI layers of frontal lobe) [41], regions of the hippocampus (stratum pyramidale), dentate Gyrus (granule cell layer), and amygdala [41,43,44]. The receptor distribution varies from low to moderate in the thalamus (low), hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens [45][46][47].

(p3.1) The basal forebrain holds moderate CB1 receptor distribution where basal ganglia (globus pallidus) consist of the highest CB1 receptor expression for the same region [41,44].

(p3.2) In the midbrain, immunostaining showed high CB1 expression in substantia nigra pars reticulata, oculomotor nucleus, and red nucleus, whereas periaqueductal gray (PAG) had moderate levels of the receptor expression concentrated on the GABAergic neuron terminals [41,46].

(p3.3) Concerning the hindbrain, CB1 distribution was found to be high within the cerebellar cortex (molecular layer), and strong immunostaining was reported around the Purkinje cell bodies (basal portion) with low positive staining in the granule cell layer [41,45]. In addition, high immunostaining was also evident within the medulla oblongata (cochlear and trigeminus nucleus) [41].

(p3.4) In the spinal cord, low levels of CB1 receptors were expressed in the brainstem region [44]. Staining revealed that spinal cord areas of the dorsal horn, intermediate region, and ventral horn show high CB1 immunoreactivity, whereas dorsal root ganglia (DRG) expresses low to moderate CB1 expression [41,48].
## (s7) Cannabis and Memory Consolidation

(p7.0) Memory consolidation is a time-dependent mechanism by which a temporary, vulnerable memory is evolved to a more stable and long-lasting form and becomes immune to intrusion from competing influences in the absence of further practice [156]. Memory continues to mature between encoding and recall via the consolidation process [157]. The overall endocannabinoid system plays a modulatory role in the coherence of neuronal activity in the brain regions (hippocampus, amygdala, PFC), leading to consolidation of aversive or arousing experiences through CB1 activation [158][159][160], thereby suggestive of the involvement of endocannabinoids in memory consolidation.

(p7.1) Emotional stress and aversive and arousal events stimulated neurological systems that played an integral role in memory consolidation and maintaining the strength of memories in accordance with their emotional significance [161]. Garcia et al. (2016) explored the role of CB1 receptors on stress-induced impairment of nonemotional memory consolidation. Interestingly, the study revealed that both central and peripheral mechanisms are involved in the stress-induced object-recognition memory impairment acting through CB1 receptors of adrenergic and nonadrenergic cells. The study by Busquets-Garcia et al. also opened newer avenues in the treatment of stress-related cognitive aspects [162].
