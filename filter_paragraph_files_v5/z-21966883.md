(p10.0) The cardiomyopathy associated with chronic infection has made Chagas disease the most lethal endemic infectious disease in the Western hemisphere (Cubillos-Garzon 2004).In a randomized urban study, the prevalence of chronic Chagas disease reached 18% of the street cleaners Brasília, Brazil (Lauria-Pires et al. 2000).Among these 245 chagasics, only two could recall an acute infection stage.This description is in keeping with the epidemiological truth that for each chagasic with a clinically disclosed acute phase of the infection, there are 125 cryptic patients.Clinical studies have shown unparalleled levels of ECG abnormalities in patients showing positive serologic tests for infection when compared with the nonchagasic population.The main life-threatening manifestations of chronic heart disease are heart failure, arrhythmias and thromboembolism.ECG abnormalities are cumulative over time and become more frequent from 20 years post acute infection.Chronic T. cruzi infections lead to an increasing number of ECG alterations recorded on two occasions 10 years apart (Lauria-Pires et al. 2000).Ventricular premature contractions, right bundle branch block, combined branch block, intraventricular conduction disturbance, and ventricular repolarization changes were recorded more frequently over time.These alterations were many-fold more frequent in Chagas patients than in controls (p < 0.001).The progressively shifting right bundle branch blocks in particular were recorded more frequently than the remaining ECG alterations in the Chagas patient population.ECG revealed ventricle wall hypokinesis and intracavitary thrombus.The heart enlargement in Chagas patients is an ominous sign, leading to a poor prognosis (Lauria Pires et al. 2000).A word of caution is needed because the severely compromised Chagas patient may die during a Holter-type ECG monitoring of arrhythmias and other heart disturbances.Moreover, patients having apparently stable ECG changes may show sudden flare-ups of an underlying defect leading to heart failure.The variability of the ECG and clinical manifestations is remarkable: Some patients showing cumulative changes in successive ECG recordings apparently halt the evolving life-threatening arrhythmias and lead a normal life.

(p10.1) In one population of chronic patients, 57% mortality was related to Chagas disease, of which 58% had heart insufficiency, and 37.5% died suddenly (Prata 1999).The remaining deaths were related to the digestive forms associated with chronic disease.The average time between acute infection and development of severe chronic Chagas lesions has been estimated at 28 ± 7 years (Prata 2001).However, Chagas cardiomyopathy rapidly progresses toward death no longer than 5 years after signs of heart failure.A common finding in death resulting from heart failure is cerebral infarction as a consequence of a thrombus detached from the left ventricle.

(p19.0) The Metatheria (Marsupialia: Didelphidae) and Eutheria (Edentata: Dasypodidae; Rodentia: Muridae) are considered the earliest mammals to become involved in the enzootic cycle of T. cruzi infection.Didelphidae and Dasypodidae, opossums and armadillos spp., respectively, are major sylvatic reservoirs (Legey et al. 1999, Yeo et al. 2005) The eco-epidemiology of enzootic Chagas disease in North America is dependent largely on the relationships of triatomine vectors with opossums and armadillos (Yaeger 1988, Karsten et al. 1992, Pung et al. 1995).T. cruzi infections among opossums ranged from 37.5% (Barr et al. 1991) to 57.1% (Ruiz-Pina and Cruz-Reyes 2002).

(p20.0) Naturally T. cruzi-infected rodents (Rodentia: Echimyidae; Rodentia: Cricetidae; and Rodentia: Muridae) have been captured in various ecosystems on the American continents.In one study, the prevalence of parasite infection reached 9.1% of captured wild rodents (Raccurt 1996).Calomys callosus (Rodentia: Cricetidae) are resistant to T. cruzi, surviving inocula that normally kill mice (Borges et al. 1992).The histopathological analysis of sections from T. cruzi-infected rodents showed parasitism of liver cells and of striated muscles.Inflammatory infiltrates in heart and skeletal muscles were moderate or absent (Borges et al. 1983).Resistance to chronic infection appeared to correlate with interferon gamma serum levels and H 2 O 2 release by peritoneal macrophages.C. callosus may have developed immune mechanisms for survival and thus acts as a reservoir (Borges et al. 1995).The interaction of T. cruzi with the caviomorph rodent Trichomys apereoides (Rodentia: Echimyidae) revealed features suggestive of an ancient adaptation to T. cruzi infection.Chronic infection in T. apereoides remained pathologically cryptic for 5 months, despite persistence of infection (Herrera et al. 2004).
