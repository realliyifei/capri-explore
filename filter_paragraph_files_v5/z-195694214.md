(p5.0) Decortication is an important process to remove impurities from plant fibers that has a critical impact on the quality of the produced fibers [27,28]. Traditional decortication methods start with separating the long bast fibers from the stems by dew or water retting; it takes around 20 days to degrade the pectin, hemicellulose, and lignin. Chemical and mechanical decortications are usually followed to treat retted materials. Chemical methods usually produce cleaner fibers, but cause concerns regarding environmental pollutions and safety issues during manufacturing [29][30][31]. Mechanical methods such as toothed breaking rollers have been used to decorticate bast fibers from Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and nanocrystals (CNC) are two major types of nanocellulose that have generally been obtained from different procedures [18]. NFC could be isolated from plants using such mechanical processes under high-pressure homogenization, grinding, and refining [22], while CNCs can been isolated by acid hydrolysis treatments [23]. NFC undergoes transverse cleavage in the amorphous regions under acid hydrolysis, and the use of sonication results in rod-like materials that are referred to as cellulose whiskers [24,25]. The properties of cellulose nanofibers derived from natural sources are influenced by several key factors such as chemical structures, internal fiber structures, microfibril angles, and cell dimensions, which differ among the different parts of a plant [26]. Natural cellulose fibers have higher mechanical strength than other natural fibers such as silk and wool, and have a Young's modulus that is comparable to that of advanced fibers such as E-glass fibers (Table 1) [3,18].

(p6.0) Decortication is an important process to remove impurities from plant fibers that has a critical impact on the quality of the produced fibers [27,28]. Traditional decortication methods start with separating the long bast fibers from the stems by dew or water retting; it takes around 20 days to degrade the pectin, hemicellulose, and lignin. Chemical and mechanical decortications are usually followed to treat retted materials. Chemical methods usually produce cleaner fibers, but cause concerns regarding environmental pollutions and safety issues during manufacturing [29][30][31]. Mechanical methods such as toothed breaking rollers have been used to decorticate bast fibers from raw plants such as hemp, flax, and linseed [27,28]. However, mechanical methods usually require dry and well-retted straws for the decortication process and may break the long fibers [27,28]. The advantage and disadvantages of various decorticate methods can be found in other reviews [29][30][31][32][33]. The developed bast fibers can be further processed to yield nanocellulose, as discussed in the following sections.
## (s9) Nanocellulose-Based Supercapacitors
Number of References: 15

(p9.0) Most conductive agents such as polymers, metallic particles, and carbon are brittle, and are therefore usually used in combination with a soft and flexible substrate to fabricate lightweight and free-standing flexible membrane electrodes for supercapacitors. Nanocellulose with highly porous structures provides an ideal substrate for loading a large amount of conductive materials, and facilitates ions' transit through their porous structures. Nanocellulose also has excellent mechanical performance with a tensile strength at 1.7 GPa and a Young's modulus at 100-130 GPa, which are comparable to those of glass and aramid fibers [46]. In addition to supercapacitors, nanocellulose membranes have also been used as flexible substrates for other types of energy storage devices, including rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) or solar cells [47,48]. These energy storage devices showed great potential on emerging power sources for wearable electronics, electric vehicles, or giant energy-storage systems.

(p9.1) Recently, advanced technologies have been developed and applied on the designs of SCs to achieve "smart" functions including self-healable, foldable, shape memory, pH-sensitive, or thermosensitive [49][50][51][52]. Most of the electrodes membranes in smart SCs were fabricated by synthetic polymers or carbon-based materials to achieve superb mechanical strength and/or flexibility, so that they can be twisted, stretched, or bent into different shapes and can return to their original shape/size with or without stimuli [9].

(p9.2) In order to enhance the electrochemical performance of the electrode membranes, a large amount of conductive materials is usually loaded onto the substrate, which may decrease the mechanical strength and flexibility of the membrane electrodes. It has been a challenge to keep an optimum balance between the electrochemical and mechanical performances of the composite membrane electrodes. Generally, there are two major procedures to incorporate conductive components into nanocellulose substrates to fabricate composite membrane electrodes: one is to coat conductive materials onto the top of nanocellulose matrix, and the other is to mix conductive agents into the nanocellulose substrate. Schematic illustrations of the fabrication process of nanocellulose-based conductive composite membranes are shown in Figure 3. The summary of nanocellulose-based conductive membranes developed for supercapacitors and energy storage devices are listed in Table 2. More details will be discussed in the following sections. including rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) or solar cells [47,48]. These energy storage devices showed great potential on emerging power sources for wearable electronics, electric vehicles, or giant energy-storage systems.

## (s11) Nanocellulose Supercapacitors Loaded with Metallic Particles

(p11.0) Metallic particles have a high intrinsic conductivity of about 10 5 S/cm, which is five times higher than that of carbon-based conductive materials [53,54]. Both metallic particles and carbon materials are usually used for direct coating on the surface of nanocellulose substrate, which is a simple and convenient method for producing conductive nanocellulose-based composite membrane electrodes. However, the conductivity of the membrane electrodes is positively associated with the loading of the metallic materials or thickness of the coating layer [55]. However, metallic particles are brittle and heavy, and therefore are difficult to be dispersed evenly onto the substrate. One way to enhance the dispersion of the materials is to coat metallic particles onto the surface of the nanocellulose substrate. Various metal hydroxides/oxides grown on nickel foam were also coated onto nanocellulose films to fabricate flexible supercapacitor electrode materials with good conductive property [56]. Peng et al. (2017) developed flexible supercapacitors with high capacitance (385 F/g) by coating copper oxide and polypyrrole onto the bacterial cellulose substrates [48]. In most cases, coating conductive polymers or carbon materials onto nanocellulose membranes may decrease the transparency because the coated layer is not uniform on a large scale, leading to a significant light scattering. Hu et al. (2013) deposited a thin layer of tin-doped indium oxide, carbon nanotubes, and silver nanowires onto transparent nanocellulose substrates to fabricate transparent and conductive nanopapers with good conductivity (25 Ω sq −1 ) and power conversion efficiency (0.4%), which can be used for applications in optoelectronics devices such as displays, touch screens, and interactive papers [57].
## (s13) Nanocellulose Supercapacitors Loaded with Conductive Carbon Materials
Number of References: 4

(p13.0) Conductive carbon materials include single wall/multiple wall carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, reduced graphene, and graphite. Conductive carbon materials generally have high conductivity and high tensile strength. Among them, carbon nanotubes have been known for their ultra-high tensile strength; graphene is a two-dimensional structure with an atomic thickness that offers extraordinary mechanical properties including a Young's modulus of 1 TPa, and an ultimate strength of 130 GPa [57]. Carbon materials could be either coated onto the nanocellulose film surface or be incorporated into nanocellulose via blending. Blending usually allows more carbon particles to be incorporated into the nanocellulose substrate as compared to surface coating, due to the carbon particles possibly becoming entrapped inside the substrate, leading to an improved conductivity of the composite membrane [66,72]. Coating carbon nanomaterials onto nanocellulose membranes can also decrease transparency, which will consequently limit their applications in advanced photosensitive conductive materials. These specific hybrids showed an excellent conductivity and electromechanical stability when stretching and bending. A recent study demonstrated flex electrodes composed of graphene and conductive polymers-coated nanocellulose matrix, which showed a capacitance of 373 F/g at 1A/g and a cycling stability at 85% of capacitance retention after 1000 cycles [73].

(p14.0) Each of the above-mentioned types of conductive material have advantages and limitations. Metallic particles have higher conductivity but lower capacity as compared to conductive polymers and carbon materials. Although carbon materials have high surface areas, superior chemical stability, extraordinary mechanical properties, and power density, they have the drawbacks of low specific capacitances and poor flexibility [74]. There are also concerns regarding the toxicity of some carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes, which are very popular ingredients for fabricating electrodes of energy storage devices. Conductive polymers can deliver as much as 10 times the energy, but have relatively lower electrical conductivity compared to carbon-based materials [9]. Conductive polymers are also not stable because of the pseudocapacitance reactions. Therefore, it has been a challenge to develop conductive materials with all the desirable properties for advanced energy devices.

(p15.0) Conductive carbon materials include single wall/multiple wall carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, reduced graphene, and graphite.

(p16.0) Each of the above-mentioned types of conductive material have advantages and limitations. Metallic particles have higher conductivity but lower capacity as compared to conductive polymers and carbon materials. Although carbon materials have high surface areas, superior chemical stability, extraordinary mechanical properties, and power density, they have the drawbacks of low specific capacitances and poor flexibility [74]. There are also concerns regarding the toxicity of some carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes, which are very popular ingredients for fabricating electrodes of energy storage devices. Conductive polymers can deliver as much as 10 times the energy, but have relatively lower electrical conductivity compared to carbon-based materials [9]. Conductive polymers are also not stable because of the pseudocapacitance reactions. Therefore, it has been a challenge to develop conductive materials with all the desirable properties for advanced energy devices.

(p16.1) Several studies have reported the limitations of cycling stability, conductivity, or specific capacitance on nanocellulose-based SCs, which are loaded with a single type of conductive material [68,[75][76][77]. Therefore, multiple conductive materials have been used in fabricating composite membrane electrodes to optimize the electrochemical performance of nanocellulose-based SCs and overcome the drawbacks of a single component. For example, carbon materials and conductive polymers can be blended together to improve both the stability and electrochemical performance of nanocellulose-based SCs. It has also been suggested that the electrochemical stability of PANI can be improved by incorporating reduced graphene oxide into PANI-based electrodes or supercapacitors [71,75,77,78]. This is because of the pseudocapacitance processes of PANI during charge-discharge cycles, in which part of the conductive polymerization product emeraldine PANI may convert to pernigraniline, which is a semiconductive polymer. This is because of the redox reactions of the ions transfer between two electrodes in pseudocapacitance polymers [76,79,80]. This situation involves the electrodes' material deformation, including swelling, shrinkage, or cracking during charge and discharge cycles, which result in the poor working stability in the supercapacitors [65,68,70,81]. In addition, the degradation of PANI may be accelerated by the deformation of electrodes; thus, it can decrease the potential of working electrodes [9,65,68,70,81]. Therefore, the combination of other materials with PANI provides synergetic benefits regarding electrochemical performance. Metallic material (Ag nanowire, Au) or carbon materials (GO/RGO, carbon nanotubes) can improve conductivity [68,82] or decrease the V IR drop on PANI-based supercapacitors. Therefore, the combination of multiple conductive materials can improve the overall electrochemical property [54,68,70,75,77,81]. Some studies reported that a synergistic effect on RGO incorporated with PANI fabricated a double-layer supercapacitor that raised the high pseudocapacitance and conductivity of the device [65,[83][84][85].

(p16.2) Besides PANI, another conductive polymer polypyrrole (PPy) has similar limitations with PANI because of their similar electrochemical properties. Therefore, similar solutions can be used to overcome such limitations. Carbon materials or other metallic particles can be incorporated along with PPy to fabricate cellulose-based SCs or electrode membranes to achieve the expected performance [73,86,87]. On the other hand, some flexible electrode membranes were made by coating metallic particles on top of cellulose or printing papers. However, this type of electrode membrane or SC did not maintain good specific capacitance when compared to the SC made by conductive polymers [55,57,88]. Adding conductive polymers significantly improves the specific capacitance and stability of the hybrid electrodes after hundreds or thousands charge and discharge cycles [89][90][91][92].
