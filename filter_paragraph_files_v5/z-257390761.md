(p4.0) In summary, the evidence reviewed demonstrates that berries and berry flavonoids can improve psychological health and cognitive function. There has been much compelling research on flavonoids influence on brain aging, neurodegeneration, and memory over the last decade [90,91]. Collectively, the results show that various fruit sources of flavonoids, such as blackcurrant and WBB, may improve mood and decrease fatigue. It is apparent that berries and berry flavonoids possess anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects in both animal and human studies. Despite the increase in research in the field, discerning the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of berry flavonoids remains a difficult challenge.
