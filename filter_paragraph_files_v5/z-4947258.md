## (s14) Area-Crossing Trade-offs for Planar Graphs
Number of References: 5

(p14.0) Many papers in graph drawing study the area requirement of planar straight-line drawings. Different popular results establish that an n-vertex planar graph can always be drawn with straight-line edges in O(n 2 ) area [81,186]. It is also proven that this bound is worst-case optimal for the family of planar graphs, as there are infinitely many planar graphs that require quadratic area to be drawn in the plane without edge crossings [81]. Several attempts have been done to prove the existence of straight-line planar drawings with o(n 2 ) area for specific sub-families of planar graphs, such as trees, outerplanar graphs, and series-parallel graphs (see, e.g., [97] for references on these results). A natural question that arises from the aforementioned results is whether allowing some edge crossings may help to reduce the area of a drawing of a planar graph. In other words, what is the area requirement of beyond-planar drawings of planar graphs? Wood shows that, for any fixed positive integer k > 0, all k-colorable graphs have a straight-line drawing in linear area; this implies that planar graphs always admit O(n) straight-line drawings with crossing edges [206]. However, the technique by Wood can give rise to drawings where some edges contain a linear number of crossings and the angles at which two edges cross can be arbitrarily small.
