(p10.0) The North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) published a clinical guideline in 2005 and more recently (in 2016) a clinical report on the diagnosis and treatment of CD in children [16,17]. Although the clinical report focused on various gluten-related disorders, it included a section on the management of CD after diagnosis. Commencement of and adherence to a strict GFD after initial education from an experienced paediatric dietitian was emphasised. A regular review was recommended initially, with follow-up by a paediatric gastroenterologist or paediatrician with wide knowledge about CD and a dietitian. The referral to a support group was considered beneficial and psychological support noted for some children.
