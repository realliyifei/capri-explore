## (s1) Description of the condition
Number of References: 12

(p1.0) The female body changes during pregnancy to create a favorable environment for fetal development which may result in musculoskeletal disorders [1,2] and painful symptoms [3], especially in the lumbopelvic region [4]. Mechanical and hormonal factors may cause morphophysiological changes during pregnancy and induce dysfunctions in the lumbopelvic region [5]. The lumbopelvic pain (LPP) includes low back (LBP) or pelvic girdle pain (PGP) or both and is the most common [1], severe, and incapacitating complaint [6] during pregnancy.

(p1.1) Approximately 10% to 21% of pregnant women report severe and incapacitating LPP. Moreover, 50% to 70% of pregnant women present LBP and 10% to 65% have PGP [7]. LPP impacts quality of life [8], causing functional disability [9] and affecting activities of daily living [1]. Also, some pregnant women present pain reduction after childbirth, while 5% to 8.5% report pain up to two years after childbirth [10].

(p3.0) Exercise is a planned, structured, and repetitive physical activity for body conditioning [8] that has greater positive effect on severity of LBP than usual care [16]. Exercises for pregnancy-related LBP are similar to those for non-specific LBP [17]. For example, walking, lowimpact aerobic exercise, and adapted yoga and pilates are safe physical activities for pregnancy [13].

(p3.1) Regular physical activity during pregnancy promotes health benefits, such as decreased frequency of gestational diabetes mellitus, prevention of preeclampsia, and improved recovery time during postpartum [13]. Exercise may also reduce pain intensity and disability and improve global functioning [14,18].
