(p4.0) Evaluation measures for multi-label classification tasks can be broadly divided into two groups: (1) labelbased measures, which evaluate the classifier's performance on each label, and (2) instance-based measures (also called example-based measures), which aim to evaluate the multi-label classifier's performance on each test instance [20][21][22]. Both groups have unique strengths and complement each other: label-based measures quantify the effectiveness of each individual label, whereas instance-based measures quantify the effectiveness of instances which may contain multiple labels. We employed representative metrics from both groups to provide a broader evaluation of the performance. Specifically, for label-based measures, we calculated macro and micro averages on Precision, Recall, and F1-score; for instance-based measures, we calculated instance-based Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Out of these nine metrics, we focus on the three F1-scores because these aggregate both Precision and Recall.
