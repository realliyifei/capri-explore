## (s16) Western pond turtle genetics
Number of References: 2

(p16.0) Based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA only, all new Mojave River samples of A. pallida we collected were found to be identical to the previously sequenced Camp Cady Mojave River samples and one of the three haplotypes found within San Mateo Creek (Fig. 3) in San Diego County, CA (Spinks and Shaffer 2005;Spinks et al. 2014). This haplotype is two mutations away from the most abundant ND4 haplotype that occurs in both San Mateo Creek and the rest of San Diego County (see Supple mentary File 1: Table S1). Two much more extensive genetic analyses using RADseq and whole genome resequencing data are in progress.
