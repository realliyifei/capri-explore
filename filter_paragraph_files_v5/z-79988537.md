(p0.0) Hepatitis is described as an inflammation of the liver [1][2][3][4][5]. It may be caused by drugs, alcohol use, or certain medical conditions. But in most cases, it is caused by a virus. This is known as viral hepatitis. The condition of hepatitis can be selflimiting or it can cause fibrosis i.e., scarring, cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis is the most common type of disease that occurs in the world. Along with virus other infections and toxic substances such as alcohol, certain drugs, and auto-immune disease can also cause hepatitis.
