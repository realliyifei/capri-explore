## (s11) Plant residues as biofertilizers
Number of References: 6

(p11.0) Plants are like all living organisms can be used as biofertilizers by using the unused parts of them (plant residues) for manufacturing of ecofriendly biodegradable fertilizers.Plant residues are used as soil biofertilizers and include banana peels.Banana is a popular fruit, because of its taste and nutritional value.As a result, large quantities of banana peel by-products are obtained.Studies have shown that the content of bananas, such as the peel and bloom, is rich in macroand micronutrients and promotes good health through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress properties.Research to transform banana peels into unique new items due to their benefits like increasing soil fertility is ongoing (Kraithong and Issara 2021) (Table 8).According to the international biochar initiative (2012), banana peel biochar is a carbon-rich product that is described as "a solid compound generated through the thermo-chemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-constrained environment" (Novak et al. 2012), (Islam et al. 2019), (Comino et al. 2020).Due to its distinctive characteristic, which enhances soil quality, banana peel biochar has recently taken center stage in research (Novak et al. 2012), (Islam et al. 2019), (Comino et al. 2020) (Table 8).
