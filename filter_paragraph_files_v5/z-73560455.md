Hastings, et al. (2003) proposed that decisions in system architectures should help to address these uncertainties, with a focus on strategies such as flexibility and robustness that can lead designers to different optimization solutions to meet specifications or other specific criteria. Crawley, et al. (2004) suggested that system architectures are not static, but they evolve for long periods as technologies mature. They also evolve during the natural process of designing a system. These evolutionary patterns are useful for understanding the importance of the representation and the decisions involved in a system architecture.
