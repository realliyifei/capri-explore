## (s2) MRI and conventional pacemakers
Number of References: 35

(p2.0) In this paper we use the term "conventional pacemakers" when discussing pacemaker-related issues concerning devices which are not specifically designed for use with MRI scanning. Conventional pacemakers encompass nearly all pacemakers which are currently on the market, with the exception of the newly available MR compatible pacing systems with the trade names MRI SureScan (Medtronic International, Tolochenaz, Switzerland) and ProMRI (Biotronik GmbH & Co., Berlin, Germany). MRI in patients with conventional cardiac pacemakers may be hazardous due to the possible interaction of the device with the different electromagnetic field used for MRI [6][7][8]. It is important to underline that both the device itself and the leads may interact with the different electromagnetic fields used in MRI. MRI uses three different electromagnetic fields to produce images: the main magnetic field; the time-varying magnetic gradient fields, and the pulsed radiofrequency (RF) field. The main magnetic field is used to align protons and is always on. Currently, MR imaging is performed at magnetic field strengths between 0.5 and 3.0 Tesla (T), whereas most MR scanners work at 1.5 T. The timevarying magnetic gradient fields are used for spatial localisation and change their strength along different orientations. The pulsed RF-field is generated by the body coil or send/receive coils and is used to change the energy state of the protons as well as elicit MRI signals from tissue. Pacemakers can interact with all of the three types of electromagnetic field used during MRI. The theoretical interactions between conventional pacemakers and the electromagnetic fields affecting the device and the leads are listed in table 1. The most important risk posed by MR imaging in patients with pacemakers is a transient or permanent influence or definite damage to the electric components of the pacemaker device (i.e., activation of the reed-switch, pacemaker resets of reprogramming). This interaction may lead to asynchronous or unpredictable pacing, which may result in tachycardia or asystole [9]. Also, animal testing has demonstrated that the temperature at the lead tip increased up to 20 °C during MRI scanning of the heart, thus possibly resulting in tissue damage [10] (fig. 1). The risk of pacemaker displacement by a possible interaction with the static magnetic field is considered to be of minor importance. Another disadvantage of conventional pacemakers is the fact that the device and the leads produce metallic artifacts which may hamper imaging interpretation at the level of the heart and the mediastinum. First experience with MRI SureScan devices did indicate that the artifacts induced by the leads and the device itself may not limit the MR scan's diagnostic value ( fig. 2). The potentially hazardous complications for patients with a conventional pacemaker in whom MRI were accidentally performed are underlined by the reported lethal consequences in these patients. In Germany alone there have been six fatalities relating to MR examinations in pacemaker patients [11]. In three of these cases there was suggestive evidence that death may have occurred due to induced ventricular fibrillation [11]. It may be assumed that the complication rate in patients with pacemakers accidentally undergoing MR imaging is higher than is reflected by the number of cases published in the literature.
