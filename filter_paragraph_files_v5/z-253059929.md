## (s1) Pt/Pd and Au/Pt ratios in Bushveld magmas
Number of References: 3

(p1.0) Global komatiites and basalts that crystallised while remaining undersaturated in sulfide melt typically have up to ~20 ppb Pd and Pt (Fig. 1). Pt/Pd ratios cluster around or just below unity, except for relatively evolved lavas many of which tend to have somewhat lower Pt/Pd. The magmas show a subtle trend of increasing Pd and Pt with falling MgO resulting from incompatibility of Pd and Pt into silicate and oxide minerals (Barnes and Ripley 2016). The observed scatter may be due to a combination of mobility of PGE in hydrothermal and low-T fluids, and equilibration with immiscible sulfide melt (notably in some of the relatively evolved samples having < 10 wt.% MgO). In addition, there is a temporal control, in that Archean komatiites tend to have lower PGE than post-Archean lavas (Maier et al. 2009;Puchtel et al. 2020).
