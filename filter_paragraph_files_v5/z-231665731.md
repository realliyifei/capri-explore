## (s13) Stage 6: Dissemination

(p13.0) Details on the dissemination of cohort findings were scarce in the included traditional cohort publications. Dissemination seems to be focused on scientific publications, which, if added to the lengthy data collection and analysis completion periods, seems to have a rather delayed character. Nonetheless, traditional cohorts may have dedicated websites through which publications and key findings can be retrieved. A further element that could be described as integral to the dissemination strategy of traditional cohorts is the use of findings for the development and dissemination of clinical tools such as risk prediction scores [18,23,25].

(p13.1) By contrast, the dissemination of findings received greater emphasis in the included eCohort publications. The internet (eg, websites, newsletters, and social media) seems to be the primary tool for communicating updates and findings [7,9,27,30]. As mentioned in the previous section, the flexibility of digitalization may allow for faster data access and therefore more possibilities for preliminary analyses. In turn, this enables more frequent communication of findings and less lengthy gaps between updates [7,27]. Communication of updates, relevant news, and findings, including community outreach (eg, by webinars) and presentations to health care staff, participants, and patients, may be a part of overall strategies for maintaining participant motivation and mitigating attrition [7,30]. An important opportunity arising from eCohort (and digital health) research is that of reproducibility. Although science is undoubtedly facing a reproducibility crisis, the internet and its inherent possibilities for data availability and accessibility may eliminate replication barriers [32]. As data and technology availability increases, the practical challenges and costs of replicating research (eg, rerunning analyses) diminish. This is further facilitated by initiatives such as open science registries that aim for transparency and wide access to public research data [32]. If done correctly, the findings of eCohorts can facilitate reproducibility and open science, turning a crisis into a strength.
## (s17) Ethics and Security

(p17.0) Security plays an equally important role in motivating and sustaining participation. Ethical and privacy issues are inherent to the internet, which comes with certain vulnerabilities and risks related to various stages of a cohort design, including recruitment, advertising, and data collection [7,9]. Targeted advertising (eg, through social media platforms) requires the use of data that might be considered as private (eg, demographics, education) before a person is even aware of a study's existence and long before they consent to participate [33,34]. Along similar lines, showing interest in an online advertised study (eg, by clicking on an advertisement) leaves an online trail that can be easily used by advertising companies for further profiling and targeted commercial advertising [33,34]. The tracking of our online behavior is inherent to the internet; nonetheless, this is challenging from an ethical and privacy perspective, especially in the context of sensitive health research. Further issues may arise from a certain loss of control over advertising, especially if that involves the sharing of advertisements by third parties and through various social media networks. Such uncontrolled spread might lead to losing sight of where a cohort is promoted, as well as of potential comments or questions that might have been posted across the internet [35]. Obtaining informed consent is an essential aspect of recruiting participants in a cohort. When conducted in a face-to-face manner, questions and concerns can be addressed interactively, which is lost if informed consent is obtained online and without individual contact. Filling this gap requires carefully designed online consent procedures that are transparent, understandable, and contain all elements of regular informed consent [36]. Finally, the internet makes it easier for sensitive data to be accessed without authorization, as well as hacked or replicated [33]. Although individual risk can be kept low if data are anonymized, some argue that the ease in which digital information is linked, shared, and merged renders all data potentially identifiable or traceable [37]. Therefore, adequate security features that keep risk at a minimum are inevitable [7]. Some of these features include robust password protections, high-standard information technology security, encrypted communication and data transfer, strict access controls, data deidentification, as well as the separation of personal information and unidentifiable data [7]. The emphasis on security also increases the responsibility that participants themselves have to carry, including adequate password protection, correct communication with study sites, and ensuring that devices and software are up to date.
