(p10.0) The interpretation of flock-based tests is different from interpreting laboratory tests for metabolites from individual animals (Oetzel, 2003). A review describes different theories (. establishment of cut-off values) and methodologies (i.e. sample size needed) to detect a specific disease . In general terms, most of the suggestions are made for bovine, thus the number of samplings significantly varies in comparison with ovine and caprine flocks, with a greater population. Nevertheless, there are some questions that, independently of the species, should be taken into account if we want to obtain reliable and reproducible data (Elbers et al., 1995):
