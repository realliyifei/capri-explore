## (s23) Hierarchical caching
Number of References: 2

(p23.0) Proxies or cache servers are arranged in a tree like structure either logically or physically. In hierarchical caching architecture, caches are placed at multiple levels of the network [30]. Individual caches can be interconnected hierarchically to mirror an inter network"s topology. Each bottom level cache is associated with a set of clients. A client request is first sent to the bottom level cache and then iteratively forwarded up the hierarchy such as institutional cache, regional cache, national cache, until the request is satisfied. If the root cache does not have target object, the request is finally directed to the origin server [31].
## (s25) Transparent web caching
Number of References: 2

(p25.0) Transparent web caching uses network devices to redirect HTTP traffic to caching servers. This technique is called transparent because web browsers do not have to be explicitly configured to point to a cache server [33]. There are two ways to deploy transparent proxy caching: at the switch level and at the router level. Router based transparent caching uses policy-based routing to direct request to the appropriate caches. In switch based transparent caching, the switch acts as a dedicated load balancer [34].
