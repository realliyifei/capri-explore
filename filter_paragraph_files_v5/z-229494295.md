(p7.0) Sahmenko et al. [46] used a dolomitic quarry by-products having a maximum size of 8 mm and containing 26% of fines less than 63 Î¼m to produce normal concrete (NC), highperformance self-compacting concrete (HPSCC) and Architectural concrete (AC) with various w/c ratios. The dolomite by-product represented 60%, 40% and 100% of the total aggregate in NC, HPSCC and AC, respectively. They reported that the HPSCC reached a slump flow of 590mm by adding 1% SP and therefore it can be classified as SF1 according ENFRAC 2005 [46]. They explained that the angular shape of the dolomite by-product may cause the limited flowability. However, the obtained workability is acceptable as a SCC.
