## (s4) Preparation of Oat β-D-Glucans with Various M w
Number of References: 22

(p4.0) Cereal (1 → 3) (1 → 4)-β-D-glucans with different M w are common in bread, flakes, and beverages [4], and the range of M w is highly dependent on processing technologies [77,78], including the temperature conditions [79][80][81], enzymatic treatment, fermentation, storage [82], and also on the oat breed [83]. In addition, the influence of environmental factors is also hard to estimate [36,84].

(p4.1) Amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes can improve the final viscosity of β-D-glucan extracts from oat-containing products [72]. For HMW β-D-glucan, viscosity increases by facilitating the release of this polysaccharide from the food matrix. On the contrary, for partially degraded LMW β-D-glucan, the final viscosity decreased without the contribution of starch and proteins. Microbial α-amylase, i.e., endo-α-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.1), produced by Bacillus licheniformis and pancreatin (EC 3.4.21.70) from pork pancreas, was the most effective for the release of oat β-D-glucan from food matrices (Table 2). Thus, these enzymes can be used in in vitro models to estimate the viscosity of oat-containing products in the lumen of the upper intestine.

LLM judge: NO

The content fails the criteria for the following reasons:
1. It contains references to non-textual elements (e.g., "[4]", "[77,78]", and "Table 2"), suggesting it was interspersed with such elements in its original form.
2. The mention of "Table 2" indicates reliance on additional information not provided in the text, making it dependent on external content for full clarity.
3. While it attempts to maintain coherence across paragraphs, the abrupt introduction of specific enzymes and their effects, without more detailed explanation or context relating to the overarching topic, slightly hinders its self-contained nature.

## (s7) Cholesterol Regulation and Bile Acid Binding
Number of References: 6

(p7.0) A substantial amount of data regarding the influence of oat β-D-glucan on blood cholesterol levels and bile acid binding is available. Forty-nine intervention trials between 1997 and 2019 reported total and LDL cholesterol lowering by oats [46]. These effects of oat β-D-glucan depend on their availability, M w , and viscosity. Gamel et al. [72] showed that the reduction of blood LDL cholesterol was more pronounced after consuming a beverage containing oat β-D-glucan than after consuming bread and cookies prepared with the same oat fiber. Compared to food with phytosterols only, oat HMW β-D-glucan included in a diet with phytosterols produced an additive effect on blood cholesterol reduction activity [118].

LLM judge: NO

The analysis reveals that the content does not meet several criteria for suitability:
- The content suggests it could be interspersed with non-textual elements (criteria 1) related to references within the text, which makes it seem less cohesive when isolated.
- There is the use of unclear symbols such as "M w" and "HMW" which could stand for molecular weight and high molecular weight, respectively, but without explanation, this violates criteria 4.
- While the content is relatively self-contained, the reliance on specific studies (e.g., Gamel et al. [72]) without providing their full context or findings in detail could impair clarity and complete understanding for someone without access to the full paper or those specific studies, potentially breaching criteria 5.
- The references included ([46], [72], [118]) suggest that the information is not entirely self-contained and relies on external data for full comprehension.

Additionally, the content could benefit from more background on the significance of oat β-D-glucan’s effects on health, specifically how it compares to alternative food items or ingredients for the same purpose not just in cholesterol lowering but also in overall health benefits to provide a comprehensive context.

## (s8) Anti-Diabetic Activities

(p8.0) Among proven positive effects, β-D-glucans are potent in glycemic level reduction in the blood, thus in tandem with cholesterol regulation consistently reducing the possibility of developing cardiovascular diseases [126][127][128]. Regand et al. [129] studied food preparations containing different ratios of oat β-D-glucans of various M w and starch to see how much this addition influences starch digestibility and postprandial glycemic response (PPGR). According to their results, the M w of oat β-D-glucan correlates with starch digestibility in foods containing both these polysaccharides. The more viscous the β-D-glucan gel, the less resistant the starch is to digestion.

(p8.1) Based on the literature analysis, Noronha et al. [130] concluded that the M w of oat β-D-glucans plays a decisive role in the effectiveness of reducing glycemic response. The minimal amounts of oat β-D-glucan needed for this purpose are 0.2 g, 2.2 g, and 3.2 g per 30 g of available carbohydrates (avCHO) for HMW (M w > 1000 kDa), MMW (M w 300-1000 kDa) and LMW (M w 300 kDa) polysaccharides, respectively. Perez-Quirce et al. [55] reported that free glucose decreased in rice bread enriched with oat LMW β-D-glucans, and the starch digestibility index decreased in bread fortified with MMW and HMW oat β-D-glucans.

(p8.2) There is evidence that the 6 g/day dosage is much more effective in reducing glycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin than the 4 g/day recommended by the European Food Safety Authority [131]. It can be explained by the prolongation of gastric emptying, although there are still few articles with data about the long-term effects on other cardiovascular disease markers such as insulin sensitivity [132]. Zaremba et al. [133] found that even 4 g of HMW oat β-D-glucan added to food is effective in lowering appetite, compared to control food with the same amount of available carbohydrates per meal, i.e., 39.7 g in the control portion and 39 in that with β-D-glucan, with no effect on ad libitum eating. Therefore, foods containing HMW oat β-D-glucans can improve digestion and satiety, but in this study the impact of LMW oat β-D-glucan did not compare to that of HMW oat β-D-glucan.

(p8.3) Wolever et al. [134] confirmed the influence of oat β-D-glucans of various M w on PPGR; they found that a decrease in M w correlates with the time reduction for blood glucose to reach its peak, while HMW β-D-glucan demonstrated the opposite effect. Zurbau et al. [135], analyzing data from 103 trials (N = 538), found that oat β-D-glucans of different M w can affect important diabetes biomarkers such as postprandial blood glucose and insulin response dramatically. The glucose incremental area under the curve (iAUC), insulin iAUC, and glucose and insulin incremental peak-rise (iPeak) values were significantly reduced (glucose iAUC and iPeak by 23% and 28%, and insulin by 22% and 24%, respectively). The authors noted that the β-D-glucan-containing diet viscosity does not always have an impact on glycemic peaks because the concentration of this polysaccharide is changed by its interaction with gastric fluid secretions. Nevertheless, the LMW oat β-D-glucan did not have an impact on iAUC and iPeak, while MMW (M w 300-1000 kDa) and HMW (M w > 1000 kDa) oat β-D-glucans were capable of regulating glucose and insulin levels in the blood.

(p8.4) Zhang et al. [136] modeled glucose diffusion and absorption in the rat small intestine by different concentrations of oat β-D-glucans of various M w and found that glucose absorption reduced with the decreasing M w of added polysaccharides. High Molecular Weight oat β-D-glucans reduced the concentration of available glucose in the small intestine more effectively than LMW oat β-D-glucans. Oat β-D-glucans inhibit starch digestion with a more pronounced effect of the HMW oat β-D-glucan. In the presence of oat β-D-glucans, the activity of Na + /K + -exchanging ATPase (EC 7.2.2.13) reduced in the small intestine mucosa of rats, and the inhibition of this activity was more pronounced when its M w and concentration increased. However, when the concentration of the β-D-glucan of defined M w increased, the Na + /K + ATPase activity increased because of higher gastrointestinal motility. The addition of oat β-D-glucans also reduced the activities of sucrose α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.48) and maltose α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20), while the effect of HMW β-D-glucans was more pronounced than that of LMW β-D-glucans.

(p8.5) Overall, many studies are proving the M w -dependent lowering effect of oat β-Dglucans on the glycemic level, and more are expected in the future [137]. Based on the data available, HMW β-D-glucan appears to be the most active fraction. We can conclude that the diet should favor fewer processed oats in food due to the better retention of HMW β-D-glucan, which is much more effective in reducing glycemic response than LMW β-D-glucan [130].

(p8.6) Among proven positive effects, β-D-glucans are potent in glycemic level reduction in the blood, thus in tandem with cholesterol regulation consistently reducing the possibility of developing cardiovascular diseases [126][127][128].

## (s10) Prebiotic Activity
Number of References: 16

(p10.0) The increasing interest in the microbiome and its composition has raised the issue of sustaining a healthy intestinal microflora supported by appropriate prebiotics, e.g., fibers or inulin. Generally, oat β-D-glucan can stimulate the growth of "good" human gut microbiota, e.g., Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Many studies have focused on oat bran and isolated β-D-glucan prebiotic activity, but only a few touch on the role of the M w in this phenomenon [141][142][143].

(p10.1) Oat β-D-glucan can influence the cardiovascular system via microbiota in a way that suggests it is a cardio-protector [144]. It can be fermented by intestinal bacteria in the colon, increasing the concentration of SCFA, i.e., acetate, butyrate, and propionate. These molecules are involved in the regulation of glucose and cholesterol metabolism via free fatty acid receptors FFA2 and FFA3 [145]. Activation of FFA2 can enhance insulin secretion and inhibit ghrelin secretion. Ligand-activated FFA2 downregulates NFkB by recruiting β-arrestin 2, leading to a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. FFA3 in pancreas islets, when activated by propionate, inhibits insulin secretion. Dong et al. [146] revealed that oat β-D-glucan hydrolysates are better substrates (even as a single carbon source) for probiotic bacteria strains than the native oat β-D-glucan. Immerstrand et al. [90] studied the effect of a series of oat bran preparations characterized by β-D-glucans of M w 2348, 1311, 241, 56, 21, and <10 kDa on plasma lipids and the fecal formation of SCFA in C57BL/6NCrl mice. They concluded that diets with oat β-D-glucan with M w from 1311 kDa down to 10-20 kDa were equally effective in reducing plasma cholesterol in mice that developed high blood cholesterol due to an atherogenic diet. Despite that, the ratio of propionic acid and butyric acid contents to the acetic acid content increased with increasing M w of β-D-glucans, leading to the conclusion that as a component of a usual Western diet, the higher M w of oat β-D-glucan is more beneficial for microbiota. Wilczak et al. [113] have shown that both LMW and HMW oat β-D-glucans increased the numbers of LAB in feces in healthy rats and rats with enteritis. The administration of β-D-glucans improved the profile of SCFA in rat feces, characterized by decreasing hydroxybutyric acid levels and increasing lactic and propionic acid content. Increasing propionic acid can be explained by improved fermentation.

## (s11) Anticancer Activity
Number of References: 16

(p11.0) β-D-Glucans demonstrated suppressive effects on tumor growth and even the reduction of primary tumor mass, though this activity can differ depending on the source of β-D-glucans [151]. For example, Shah et al. [152] proved oat β-D-glucan to be a more potent anti-proliferative agent on the cell line Colo-205 than barley β-D-glucan.

(p11.1) Despite reports about β-D-glucan being effective in combination with anticancer treatments, only a few clinical trials to consistently study the anticancer activity of β-Dglucan were established [153]. Unfortunately, despite the authors often underlining the importance of the M w of the used β-D-glucan fraction, few works show the comparison in the activity of oat β-D-glucans with different M w in the range of the same study.

(p11.2) Parzonko et al. [154] studied oat LMW β-D-glucan (M w 134 kDa) as an anticancer agent on human HTB140 melanoma cells using an MTT assay. At the β-D-glucan concentration of 200 µg/mL, the viability of cells was 50%, and the cytotoxic effect of this polysaccharide was concentration-dependent, as well as lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) release into the culture media. There were also changes in the mitochondrial functions of HTB-140 cells. Intracellular ATP levels negatively correlated with the rise of the concentration of β-Dglucan, with the lowest value 50.8 ± 7.8% at 200 µg/mL. The authors stated that the same experiment conducted in parallel on the cell line of normal fibroblasts had shown no cytotoxicity. Choromanska et al. [67] studied the anticancer activity of the LMW oat β-D-glucan, analyzing its possible toxicity for four cell lines: human pigmented malignant melanoma Me45, human epidermoid carcinoma A431, normal human keratinocyte HaCaT, and normal mouse macrophage P388/D1. The results suggested that oat β-D-glucans decreased the viability of both cancer cell lines and did not show a toxic effect on normal cells. In another study, Choromanska et al. [155] evaluated how LMW and HMW oat β-Dglucans affect normal keratinocytes, two lung cancer cell lines, and red blood cell hemolysis. The authors also confirmed tolerance to oat β-D-glucan by normal cells. Red blood cell hemolysis tended to be slowed to 51.64% by β-D-glucan treatment, with HMW being more effective in high concentrations than LMW β-D-glucan. In addition, MDA, the final product of lipid peroxidation, increased in a dose-dependent mode administrating HMW β-D-glucans to H69AR cells. Low and high concentrations of LMW β-D-glucans caused nucleus perturbations and abnormal chromatin condensation in A549 and HaCaT cells. All concentrations of HMW fractions caused actin fiber abnormalities in H69AR and HaCaT cells. A study on Me45 cells has shown that LMW oat β-D-glucans at a high concentration of 200 µg/mL in cell-growth media decreased the viability of melanoma cells to 19%, while in combination with electroporation to 12.5%, and caspase 3 expression increased significantly. At the concentration of 100 µg/mL, half of all cells were stained positively for cytochrome c. For caspase 12, a positive reaction was evident at 100 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL of oat β-D-glucans in media. This work evidences that LMW oat β-D-glucans have the potential to initiate the apoptotic process in melanoma cells involving cytochrome c, which participates in caspase activation, followed by the activation of dormant killer proteases [156].

(p11.3) Zhang et al. [157] evaluated the anticarcinogenic effect of three oat β-D-glucans with M w of 10 kDa, 200 kDa, and 500 kDa on mice inoculated in the flanks with B16F10 tumor cells. The polysaccharide solutions were injected intra-peritoneally in the tumor-bearing animals at 25 mg/kg. The control group of mice received PBS or dextran solution. A part of the mice were intravenously injected in the tail with B16F10 cells to generate lung metastasis. Similarly, in an osteosarcoma metastasis model, 5 K7 M2-luc2 mouse osteosarcoma cells were intravenously injected into Balb/c mice; the animals received 25 mg/kg of oat β-D-glucan (M w 200 kDa) intranasally. This preparation inhibited tumor growth the most effectively. Mice injected with B16F10 melanoma intravenously after treatment with the 200 kDa β-D-glucan demonstrated the lowest incidence of lung metastases. Tumors treated with oat β-D-glucans also showed microenvironmental differences, particularly regarding pro-inflammatory factors IFN-γ, TNF-α, and Th-1 chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10). The IRF1 and PDL-1 levels increased, and T cells, which produced Granzyme B and IFN-γ, infiltrated tumors. CD11 b+ and CD11 c+ cells, DC, T cells, and presumably NK cells supported the immune control of B16F10 treated with oat β-D-glucans. The authors hypothesized about an unidentified signaling pathway involved in the activation of DC by β-D-glucan-activated macrophages since conditioned media from later were more potent in DC activation than DC directly treated with β-D-glucan.

How do oat β-D-glucans vary in their anticancer efficacy, and what evidence supports their role in reducing tumor viability, modulating immune response, and initiating apoptosis in cancer cells?

Thus, these enzymes can be used in in vitro models to estimate the viscosity of oat-containing products in the lumen of the upper intestine.

LLM judge: NO

The content fails criterion 3 as it includes a complex mixture of technical terms, chemical names, and references to specific enzymes with their EC numbers, which could be challenging for laypersons to understand without further context or explanation. Furthermore, the mention of "Table 2" suggests that the text relies on non-textual elements (graphs, tables) for a complete understanding, violating criterion 4. The content also doesn't stand as self-contained with clear, comprehensive context needed to understand the impacts of different factors on β-D-glucan viscosity in oat-containing products fully, failing criterion 5.

(p30.0) Among proven positive effects, β-D-glucans are potent in glycemic level reduction in the blood, thus in tandem with cholesterol regulation consistently reducing the possibility of developing cardiovascular diseases [126][127][128]. Regand et al. [129] studied food preparations containing different ratios of oat β-D-glucans of various M w and starch to see how much this addition influences starch digestibility and postprandial glycemic response (PPGR). According to their results, the M w of oat β-D-glucan correlates with starch digestibility in foods containing both these polysaccharides.

(p30.1) Based on the literature analysis, Noronha et al. [130] concluded that the M w of oat β-D-glucans plays a decisive role in the effectiveness of reducing glycemic response. The minimal amounts of oat β-D-glucan needed for this purpose are 0.2 g, 2.2 g, and 3.2 g per 30 g of available carbohydrates (avCHO) for HMW (M w > 1000 kDa), MMW (M w 300-1000 kDa) and LMW (M w 300 kDa) polysaccharides, respectively. Perez-Quirce et al.

Based on the data available, HMW β-D-glucan appears to be the most active fraction. We can conclude that the diet should favor fewer processed oats in food due to the better retention of HMW β-D-glucan, which is much more effective in reducing glycemic response than LMW β-D-glucan [130].

(p30.6) Among proven positive effects, β-D-glucans are potent in glycemic level reduction in the blood, thus in tandem with cholesterol regulation consistently reducing the possibility of developing cardiovascular diseases [126][127][128]. Regand et al. [129] studied food preparations containing different ratios of oat β-D-glucans of various M w and starch to see how much this addition influences starch digestibility and postprandial glycemic response (PPGR). According to their results, the M w of oat β-D-glucan correlates with starch digestibility in foods containing both these polysaccharides. The more viscous the β-D-glucan gel, the less resistant the starch is to digestion.

(p30.7) Based on the literature analysis, Noronha et al. [130] concluded that the M w of oat β-D-glucans plays a decisive role in the effectiveness of reducing glycemic response. The minimal amounts of oat β-D-glucan needed for this purpose are 0.2 g, 2.2 g, and 3.2 g per 30 g of available carbohydrates (avCHO) for HMW (M w > 1000 kDa), MMW (M w 300-1000 kDa) and LMW (M w 300 kDa) polysaccharides, respectively. Perez-Quirce et al. [55] reported that free glucose decreased in rice bread enriched with oat LMW β-D-glucans, and the starch digestibility index decreased in bread fortified with MMW and HMW oat β-D-glucans.

(p30.8) There is evidence that the 6 g/day dosage is much more effective in reducing glycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin than the 4 g/day recommended by the European Food Safety Authority [131]. It can be explained by the prolongation of gastric emptying, although there are still few articles with data about the long-term effects on other cardiovascular disease markers such as insulin sensitivity [132]. Zaremba et al. [133] found that even 4 g of HMW oat β-D-glucan added to food is effective in lowering appetite, compared to control food with the same amount of available carbohydrates per meal, i.e., 39.7 g in the control portion and 39 in that with β-D-glucan, with no effect on ad libitum eating. Therefore, foods containing HMW oat β-D-glucans can improve digestion and satiety, but in this study the impact of LMW oat β-D-glucan did not compare to that of HMW oat β-D-glucan.

(p30.9) Wolever et al. [134] confirmed the influence of oat β-D-glucans of various M w on PPGR; they found that a decrease in M w correlates with the time reduction for blood glucose to reach its peak, while HMW β-D-glucan demonstrated the opposite effect. Zurbau et al. [135], analyzing data from 103 trials (N = 538), found that oat β-D-glucans of different M w can affect important diabetes biomarkers such as postprandial blood glucose and insulin response dramatically. The glucose incremental area under the curve (iAUC), insulin iAUC, and glucose and insulin incremental peak-rise (iPeak) values were significantly reduced (glucose iAUC and iPeak by 23% and 28%, and insulin by 22% and 24%, respectively). The authors noted that the β-D-glucan-containing diet viscosity does not always have an impact on glycemic peaks because the concentration of this polysaccharide is changed by its interaction with gastric fluid secretions. Nevertheless, the LMW oat β-D-glucan did not have an impact on iAUC and iPeak, while MMW (M w 300-1000 kDa) and HMW (M w > 1000 kDa) oat β-D-glucans were capable of regulating glucose and insulin levels in the blood.

(p30.10) Zhang et al. [136] modeled glucose diffusion and absorption in the rat small intestine by different concentrations of oat β-D-glucans of various M w and found that glucose absorption reduced with the decreasing M w of added polysaccharides. High Molecular Weight oat β-D-glucans reduced the concentration of available glucose in the small intestine more effectively than LMW oat β-D-glucans. Oat β-D-glucans inhibit starch digestion with a more pronounced effect of the HMW oat β-D-glucan. In the presence of oat β-D-glucans, the activity of Na + /K + -exchanging ATPase (EC 7.2.2.13) reduced in the small intestine mucosa of rats, and the inhibition of this activity was more pronounced when its M w and concentration increased. However, when the concentration of the β-D-glucan of defined M w increased, the Na + /K + ATPase activity increased because of higher gastrointestinal motility. The addition of oat β-D-glucans also reduced the activities of sucrose α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.48) and maltose α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20), while the effect of HMW β-D-glucans was more pronounced than that of LMW β-D-glucans.

(p30.11) Overall, many studies are proving the M w -dependent lowering effect of oat β-Dglucans on the glycemic level, and more are expected in the future [137]. Based on the data available, HMW β-D-glucan appears to be the most active fraction. We can conclude that the diet should favor fewer processed oats in food due to the better retention of HMW β-D-glucan, which is much more effective in reducing glycemic response than LMW β-D-glucan [130].

## (s32) Prebiotic Activity
Number of References: 16

(p32.0) The increasing interest in the microbiome and its composition has raised the issue of sustaining a healthy intestinal microflora supported by appropriate prebiotics, e.g., fibers or inulin. Generally, oat β-D-glucan can stimulate the growth of "good" human gut microbiota, e.g., Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Many studies have focused on oat bran and isolated β-D-glucan prebiotic activity, but only a few touch on the role of the M w in this phenomenon [141][142][143].

(p32.1) Oat β-D-glucan can influence the cardiovascular system via microbiota in a way that suggests it is a cardio-protector [144]. It can be fermented by intestinal bacteria in the colon, increasing the concentration of SCFA, i.e., acetate, butyrate, and propionate. These molecules are involved in the regulation of glucose and cholesterol metabolism via free fatty acid receptors FFA2 and FFA3 [145]. Activation of FFA2 can enhance insulin secretion and inhibit ghrelin secretion. Ligand-activated FFA2 downregulates NFkB by recruiting β-arrestin 2, leading to a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. FFA3 in pancreas islets, when activated by propionate, inhibits insulin secretion. Dong et al. [146] revealed that oat β-D-glucan hydrolysates are better substrates (even as a single carbon source) for probiotic bacteria strains than the native oat β-D-glucan. Immerstrand et al. [90] studied the effect of a series of oat bran preparations characterized by β-D-glucans of M w 2348, 1311, 241, 56, 21, and <10 kDa on plasma lipids and the fecal formation of SCFA in C57BL/6NCrl mice. They concluded that diets with oat β-D-glucan with M w from 1311 kDa down to 10-20 kDa were equally effective in reducing plasma cholesterol in mice that developed high blood cholesterol due to an atherogenic diet. Despite that, the ratio of propionic acid and butyric acid contents to the acetic acid content increased with increasing M w of β-D-glucans, leading to the conclusion that as a component of a usual Western diet, the higher M w of oat β-D-glucan is more beneficial for microbiota. Wilczak et al. [113] have shown that both LMW and HMW oat β-D-glucans increased the numbers of LAB in feces in healthy rats and rats with enteritis. The administration of β-D-glucans improved the profile of SCFA in rat feces, characterized by decreasing hydroxybutyric acid levels and increasing lactic and propionic acid content. Increasing propionic acid can be explained by improved fermentation.

## (s33) Anticancer Activity
Number of References: 16

(p33.0) β-D-Glucans demonstrated suppressive effects on tumor growth and even the reduction of primary tumor mass, though this activity can differ depending on the source of β-D-glucans [151]. For example, Shah et al. [152] proved oat β-D-glucan to be a more potent anti-proliferative agent on the cell line Colo-205 than barley β-D-glucan.

(p33.1) Despite reports about β-D-glucan being effective in combination with anticancer treatments, only a few clinical trials to consistently study the anticancer activity of β-Dglucan were established [153]. Unfortunately, despite the authors often underlining the importance of the M w of the used β-D-glucan fraction, few works show the comparison in the activity of oat β-D-glucans with different M w in the range of the same study.

(p33.2) Parzonko et al. [154] studied oat LMW β-D-glucan (M w 134 kDa) as an anticancer agent on human HTB140 melanoma cells using an MTT assay. At the β-D-glucan concentration of 200 µg/mL, the viability of cells was 50%, and the cytotoxic effect of this polysaccharide was concentration-dependent, as well as lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) release into the culture media. There were also changes in the mitochondrial functions of HTB-140 cells. Intracellular ATP levels negatively correlated with the rise of the concentration of β-Dglucan, with the lowest value 50.8 ± 7.8% at 200 µg/mL. The authors stated that the same experiment conducted in parallel on the cell line of normal fibroblasts had shown no cytotoxicity. Choromanska et al. [67] studied the anticancer activity of the LMW oat β-D-glucan, analyzing its possible toxicity for four cell lines: human pigmented malignant melanoma Me45, human epidermoid carcinoma A431, normal human keratinocyte HaCaT, and normal mouse macrophage P388/D1. The results suggested that oat β-D-glucans decreased the viability of both cancer cell lines and did not show a toxic effect on normal cells. In another study, Choromanska et al. [155] evaluated how LMW and HMW oat β-Dglucans affect normal keratinocytes, two lung cancer cell lines, and red blood cell hemolysis. The authors also confirmed tolerance to oat β-D-glucan by normal cells. Red blood cell hemolysis tended to be slowed to 51.64% by β-D-glucan treatment, with HMW being more effective in high concentrations than LMW β-D-glucan. In addition, MDA, the final product of lipid peroxidation, increased in a dose-dependent mode administrating HMW β-D-glucans to H69AR cells. Low and high concentrations of LMW β-D-glucans caused nucleus perturbations and abnormal chromatin condensation in A549 and HaCaT cells. All concentrations of HMW fractions caused actin fiber abnormalities in H69AR and HaCaT cells. A study on Me45 cells has shown that LMW oat β-D-glucans at a high concentration of 200 µg/mL in cell-growth media decreased the viability of melanoma cells to 19%, while in combination with electroporation to 12.5%, and caspase 3 expression increased significantly. At the concentration of 100 µg/mL, half of all cells were stained positively for cytochrome c. For caspase 12, a positive reaction was evident at 100 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL of oat β-D-glucans in media. This work evidences that LMW oat β-D-glucans have the potential to initiate the apoptotic process in melanoma cells involving cytochrome c, which participates in caspase activation, followed by the activation of dormant killer proteases [156].

(p33.3) Zhang et al. [157] evaluated the anticarcinogenic effect of three oat β-D-glucans with M w of 10 kDa, 200 kDa, and 500 kDa on mice inoculated in the flanks with B16F10 tumor cells. The polysaccharide solutions were injected intra-peritoneally in the tumor-bearing animals at 25 mg/kg. The control group of mice received PBS or dextran solution. A part of the mice were intravenously injected in the tail with B16F10 cells to generate lung metastasis. Similarly, in an osteosarcoma metastasis model, 5 K7 M2-luc2 mouse osteosarcoma cells were intravenously injected into Balb/c mice; the animals received 25 mg/kg of oat β-D-glucan (M w 200 kDa) intranasally. This preparation inhibited tumor growth the most effectively. Mice injected with B16F10 melanoma intravenously after treatment with the 200 kDa β-D-glucan demonstrated the lowest incidence of lung metastases. Tumors treated with oat β-D-glucans also showed microenvironmental differences, particularly regarding pro-inflammatory factors IFN-γ, TNF-α, and Th-1 chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10). The IRF1 and PDL-1 levels increased, and T cells, which produced Granzyme B and IFN-γ, infiltrated tumors. CD11 b+ and CD11 c+ cells, DC, T cells, and presumably NK cells supported the immune control of B16F10 treated with oat β-D-glucans. The authors hypothesized about an unidentified signaling pathway involved in the activation of DC by β-D-glucan-activated macrophages since conditioned media from later were more potent in DC activation than DC directly treated with β-D-glucan.
