(p4.0) This Special Issue of Membranes would not be complete if it did not provide an insight into novel module and reactor design. Here, micro-membrane reactors that enhance heat management, reduce gas phase diffusion limitations, and increase the membrane area to reactor volume ratio compared to traditional tubular reactors are introduced [14,15]. The papers dealing with this topic are those of Wunsch et al., which report a number of aspects related to micro-membrane reactors, ranging from reactor configuration development, feasible and low-cost fabrication techniques of micro-membranes, and optimal coupling and integration of reactive and separating processes in single compact modules [6,16]. Specifically, Dittmeyer and colleagues at the Institute for Micro Process Engineering at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have developed micro-membrane reactors composed of stacks of sub-modules including multiple reactive and permeative stages. Even though the idea of using staged membrane reactors is not new [17], the technological approach at KIT is to develop compact systems so as to minimize the drawbacks of larger-scale devices, such as heat removal, concentration polarization and a relatively low membrane surface area per catalyst volume (ca. 10 3 -10 6 m âˆ’1 ). The main applications of these micro devices, for now, are reforming of methane and dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) [6,16], which we also refer to in Section 2.4.
