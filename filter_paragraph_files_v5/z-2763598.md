(p0.0) What determines difficulty of problems for humans? Is there any relation between difficulty for humans and computational complexity for computers? Can we predict difficulty of problems algorithmically? Answers to these questions can give us an insight into human cognition and provide impulses for development of artificial intelligence. Moreover, these questions have important practical applications in human-computer collaboration and in training of problem solving skills, e.g., for developing intelligent tutoring systems [2,3,4].
