## (s4) The Choice of Uterine Pressure
Number of References: 2

(p4.0) Clinicians use various methods to improve the factors that may cause OHIA during hysteroscopic surgery. It is necessary to reduce intrauterine pressure as much as possible to reduce the absorption in the blood vessels and the abdominal cavity [14]. In 2012, Chinese Code for Diagnosis and Treatment of Gynecological Hysteroscopy recommended the use of hysteroscopic perfusion system; the perfusion pressure was set at 80-100 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa or ≤ the patient's mean arterial pressure). Hsieh et al. [26] showed that acute pulmonary edema was caused by excessive perfusion pressure.

What methods do clinicians utilize, as discussed in the 2012 Chinese Code, to mitigate OHIA during hysteroscopic surgery?

## (s10) Management of Hypothermia

(p10.0) At present, there is increased awareness of the harm of hypothermia in clinical practice, and there are many thermal measures for perioperative patients, such as skin warmth, air heating, resistance heating, and heat radiator [33]. However, for hysteroscopic surgery, in addition to the above thermal measures, the temperature of dilatant solution is also worth considering. Sessler [21] showed that it was impossible to warm the patient by heating the infusion of fluids; at ambient temperatures, however, each liter of fluid lowers the average adult's body temperature by about 0.25°C. When a large amount of liquid input is required (i.e., several liters per hour) and heating the air alone proves insufficient to keep warm, the injected liquid should be heated. Therefore, adequate thermal insulation for patients in hysteroscopic surgery is vital. To date, most studies on the temperature of dilatant solution used by hysteroscopy have focused on postoperative pain, patient satisfaction, blood loss and intraoperative clarity of hysteroscopy [33,34]. Although these studies do not show the effect of distending medium on body temperature, we do know that distending medium is safe to reach these temperatures during hysteroscopic surgery. At present, iThermonitor monitoring has been gradually applied to monitor the core temperature of patients in clinical operations. Body temperature monitoring can provide a real-time guide on the effect of warming for patients, thereby reducing perioperative chills, affecting the recovery time and postoperative satisfaction of patients.

LLM judge: YES

What are the considerations for maintaining optimal body temperature in patients undergoing hysteroscopic surgery, and how does modern monitoring contribute to patient recovery?
